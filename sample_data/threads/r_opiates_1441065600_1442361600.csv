Am I making a huge mistake?,"I should preface this with my background: I'm very well acquainted with oxycodone, but since I'm more of a binge user than a chronic one, my tolerance has stayed somewhere between mild and moderate. 

I have never dealt with the heroin crowd before and I've gotta drive the dude to pick up. He's just an old hippie, really trustworthy. Trying dope (not mainlining it) is in the optional clause of my bucket list, and I am still unsure as to whether I'll do this today or not. I guess all I need from you guys and gals is some experiential advice, harm reduction, etc. Reading over this post, it looks like I'm just asking the reader to talk me out of it. 

Anyway, just tell me what you think a heroin virgin ought to hear, and if this has been posted a million times, tell me nicely and I'll delete it.

**EDIT:** You guys have firmly convinced me not to go through with this. Thank you for talking me out of it. I've been in a weird place lately where I'm feeling a bit too nihilistic and self-destructive, and this could have just as easily been the beginning of the end of my life. I'm a polypharmic addict who feels like he needs to be on *something* at all times just to be happy, preferably opiates/opioids. I'm in danger right *now*; my life and relationships can't stand much more ruin or tension as it is.

r/opiates is a surprisingly great community. I like the blunt honesty I'm seeing here. Thanks again.",1441115987.0

My tolerance hasn't gone crazy, 2 blotters still gets me pretty high.  Every other morning I get up and I'm clean enough to take a dump, but not sick.  
This morning I woke up 2 hours early in soaking wet sheets, sick as fuck.  I couldn't get right to my stash, so I had to wait it out a bit.  This was full-blown dopesick, nausea, sweating, tremors, goosebumps, etc.  I took a blotter 20 minutes ago and I'm just beginning to feel normal.  If I'm going to need to start waking up to dose, I'm done with this shit, I'll get on subs.

I don't understand what happened.  Did my tolerance just take a massive jump or something?  Night before last I made it at least 12 hours between doses with no withdrawal.  Last night I made it at most 8 hours, and I was full on sick.

Is this a normal thing that happens? I know Fent is known as a drug that gets you to redose quicker and quicker, but this was a big jump in one night.

EDIT: While I was throwing up just now, a thought occurred to me.  Maybe these blotters were poorly laid.  I did just start a new sheet yesterday, maybe the ones I took last night and one I just took are weaker than the last batch.",1441110243.0

I'm switching from 20mg of methadone tomorrow to 4mg of bupe/subutex. First dose 4mg, second 6mg, third is 8mg. I don't plan on going any higher than 8mg

After around 2 weeks I'll switch from subutex to suboxone (same thing +narcan). They don't put you straight on suboxone to avoid withdrawals caused by narcan but it's a hassle cos they don't provide take always of subutex

Anyone done a similar transfer? Able to give me a hint of what I'm in for?

Had last drink (probably about 3.5ml/17.5mg) about 9am this morning, what time should I get dosed tomorrow 

Are many people on methadone? I see lots of references to suboxone but very few done referenced

I live with him, my aunt, and my boyfriend. And since he's been home things have been a lot easier for all of us. He was in work release in prison so he got hooked up with a good landscaping gig making $700+ a week and he would give a lot directly to my aunt. So it's been awesome having food in the house for once. We (my bf and I) didn't have to pay as much rent either so we get to do even more dope sometimes and actually feel it and have fun with it. But a few days ago we all called it. He disappeared after work until around 9pm, which isn't even that late, but we just knew it. My aunt even joked, ""watch, we see him on the news *nervous laughing*"" Well, yup. He managed to get himself a highlight on, at the very least, the regional FOX news. Video, pictures, an interview with a victim (nothing violent) and a couple neighbors and my goddamn address, ugh. This is his first time ever on the news but he's been locked up A LOT. Career criminal his file says. He was on both parole and probation somehow today when he got lugged after being locked up for 7 years. He was out for less than 3 months and he got picked up for the same exact thing. Not a very good career criminal, more like career fuck-up. It is sad though. He tried getting on Suboxone because he was having cravings and bought one off the street and said it really helped him but his parole officer told him he couldn't because he had so much clean time. I don't know, he probably would've fucked up like this either way. During the news I started getting phone calls from ""concerned"" motherfuckers who don't care and are just nosey. I already talked to everyone, I thought needed to know so I ignored them all. His car was towed earlier in the day by a different town, but the police won't give me the keys he had on him (after I spoke with the sergeant and he told me to come get them) so I can't get his car out and I'm kind of scared about that. If his lawyer can't get them at his court date in the a.m. then it goes with him to the state pen and then it's impossible to get them and the car is gone (its a nice car, selling it would really help us). I don't know, I'm really disappointed in him but I'm not surprised. He is obviously fucked in the head to keep doing the same shit and is probably institutionalized and really can't handle his drug use at all. It makes me sad.",1441090582.0

It's been a while, I haven't posted here for almost a year after I got clean back in December. I relapsed in June and, well, u guys know how it goes...

Anyway, here I am finding myself getting so dangerously close to picking up the needle. My girl slams so there's clean rigs laying around and I've seen her shoot up more than enough times to know how to prep a shot. I've also switched from tons of Rx pills to almost exclusively tar. So needless to say, the works are all immediately available to me to fix a shot right now.

The one and only thing that is stopping me is the simple fact that I have met maybe one or two people over 10 years of opiate use that either only used a needle once, or has gone from continuous IV use and then back to smoking or sniffing dope. 

I just gathered up all the shit needed for a shot but backed out last minute and threw the dope on foil. I KNOW I'm gonna love the rush and how much higher I'll be able to get vs smoking, but I REALLY don't wanna feel compelled to have to slam every dose from here on out...

So of course, I'm curious to see if there's anyone out there who either only ever IV'd once, or went from continuous IV use and then back to smoking or sniffing dope. If so, why and how did u manage to put down the needle? Your insight will be appreciated! Thanks!

 ""You have always had a nasty streak in you sister.""

 Jason looks up the stairway and knows.  He can hear them.  Same old shit as last week.  Too many people.  The old man down the hall pretends to sweep the floor.  He knows.  The resident hall manager downstairs knows.  Jason is sure the blank cars down the street with undercover cops in them know too.

 And he feels helpless.  No way to reach her except going to the room.  But fear of cops, fear of jail and fear of death keep him from that walk.  He can't even speak to her these days.  Residents here share a pay phone in the hallway and she won't leave her room.  She doesn't have to.  They come to her.  Fuck.  She is less than 200 feet away but she might as well be across the sea.  Maybe this is what she wants.  All those cuts on her arms and thighs.  All the times she starts crying for no reason at all.  Misery wraps around her like a padded cell.  

Fuck this, thinks Jason as he turns around to leave.

 As he walks out he knows she wants this.  This is her design.  A customer funded death.  As Jason turns the corner he see's one of Caesar's boys casually driving by.  Jason knows the car from the Mission.  This guy delivers the dealers to the parks.  There is a Bay Mart halfway down the block.  Jason goes over to the phone.  He thinks about options.  He thinks about how crazy she is.  He thinks about how sane her smile was when he held her.  When she was safe.  

 He makes the call.

 ""Ever notice how they never have any personal shit in their rooms?"" says Detective Diaz.

 He walks gingerly through the mess.  Clothes on the ground, newspapers, magazines and a small TV.  These state sponsored rooms are hard to get.  The waiting list is long because so many people have sad stories.  But the one thing on the contract that is inherently specified is: No Drugs.  

 ""Gone"" sighs Detective Madison looking around.

 But Diaz's statement holds true.  If there are pictures of loved ones, posters or even the slightest hints of a decorative touch like a houseplant or even a fucking kitten calendar there is hope.  But a room with nothing but a bed, blank walls, garbage and a TV is a space to conduct business.  Or a place to die, muses Detective Madison.  

 But the evidence of what goes on here screams JUNKIE.  All over the table are balloons.  Rainbow-hued rubber shards.  But these balloons didn't pop.  They were peeled and clawed by desperate fingers.  

 Detective Madison sighs.  She was hoping to catch their prey passed out.  Searching state sponsored housing is always depressing.  A phone cord people used to tie off veins lies on the ground next to an overflowing trash can that will need to be searched.  In the garbage there will be needles, cookers, bloody tissues and maybe receipts to log in the file.   But Jessica Ann Salter AKA Jasmine Pepper AKA Autumn Smith is long gone.  

 ""Boss?  Should I call base?  Let Jackson know?""

 ""Ok"" agrees Detective Madison.  

 This tip was from a someone that knew Jessica.  Relatives will often call but so will your friends.  The ones that know how black the fucking night can get.  Someone knew what was happening.  No one dealing this much tar would ever get a pass from the locals.

 ""I used to love cooking with my mom"" says Kym wistfully from the couch as I make her a peanut butter sandwich.  ""Lamb kebabs, citrus salads and tahdig.  Remember tahdig babe?  The crunchy yogurt fried rice one?""

 ""Yup.  Like Persian potato chips"" I respond mechanically.  

 To be honest I'm nauseous.  Only soda and simple sandwiches stay down.  But Kym's notion of comfort food?  Things like pomegranate chicken stews?  No fucking way.

 ""Kym?""

 ""What?""

 ""Why are we talking about this?  You refuse to cook-""

 ""I don't know!"" moans Kym.  ""I feel like shit.  I hate this!  Where's Jason?!""

 Where indeed?  

 In this great port city, all the connections dried up.  Nothing.  No more Chinatown Dragon powder, no more Mexican tar.  No more nothing.  Even the oxy is gone.  Nothing.

 When Jason pulled up to X-Files Friday with NO HEROIN Kym and I were like What the fuck...?  But we dealt.  And now it's Monday morning...Still no FUCKING HEROIN.

 We suffer.  A gray day in the city is like slow death when you have withdrawals.  Sad and hopeless.  Tombstone gray skies with cold earth chills.  Hope?  During the pain of withdrawal, hope is a corpse forgotten in the ground.  

 We are civilized.  But it begins to unravel. I go in Jason's room and steal some tar he has hidden in the garbage.  We don't have maid service so hiding tar in the garbage is brilliant.  I share with Kym who urged me to steal it.  We feverishly burn it on foil and pass it back and forth in passionless kisses.  Like CPR.  Trying to bring the dragon back to life.  

 ""When I was in boarding school I had bronchitis"" says Kym lighting a cigarette.  ""I had codeine cough syrup you know?  Back then I used a spoon instead of just chugging it.  I remember waking up and seeing all these ants.  They crawled into the spoon and drank the syrup.""

 ""Yeah?"" I say taking the cigarette from her hand.  

 The hit dulls some of the pain but euphoria soars impossibly high above us.  The wings of the god stir up the air so we can almost feel him...but he is so far away.  

 ""Yeah babe.  I was like stupid druggie ants!  They OD'd in the spoon.  Now I think we're the stupid druggie ants you know?  Oh babe are we fucked or what?""

 ""What?"" I laugh projecting calmness.  ""Why would you think that?"" I ask softly touching her face.

 ""I don't know.  I feel pain without it.  I'm afraid it will go too far...""

 ""No!"" I say sitting up.  ""We won't let that happen.  We're NOT like that ok?""

 ""Yeah...ok"" says Kym glumly.

 I don't like the way she sounds.  Everything is so harsh when there is no love from the Flower God.  The shower burns your skin, cigarettes taste toxic,beer tastes sour and food is a disgusting paste to keep you alive.  

 But the passion of being alive is gone.  


~^~^~^~^~^~^~
 

 I awake in Darkness.  Freezing cold and dopesick.  My body is wound up, sore and snot and drool flow freely.  Kym has claimed the comforter, thrashed herself almost perpendicular so her knees were shoved into my back.  She hugs her pillow in angst but I can tell she is asleep from her rhythmic breathing.  For a moment I get lost in her looks.  She sleep's naked...Usually this would be acceptable boyfriend behavior but last night was tough for both of us.  Getting drunk helped a little but not nearly enough.  Kym kicked, groaned and sweated all through the night.  Poor thing.  I let her sleep, dress in the dark and walk to the kitchen.  

 I boil water, grind some Sumatra coffee beans and make a cup of coffee in Kym's press pot.  The smell of fresh coffee brings hope to the morning gloom.  My copy of Modern Control Systems lies on the table.  I slip my fingers in the spine, feel the package and pull it out.  Two 30mg oxys I stole from Kym.  I take one as I add sugar to my coffee.  The warmth returns to my bones.  

 A half smoked joint lies in the ashtray.  I relight it and toast frozen waffles.  I play Kym's Moody Blues tape Tuesday Afternoon.  

 ""Fuck dude!"" comes the groan from the living room.  ""First you grind coffee and now you play this hippie shit?""

 Nearly ninja invisible, Jason is huddled all in black and melts into the couch shadows.  Only his pale face and exposed white arm reflect light.  He rolls up his sleeve, sighs and leans forward.

 ""Did you get anything?"" I ask eagerly.

 Jason looks up, visibly annoyed but then shakes his head.  I sigh.  Plate up my waffles with butter and hand him one.

 ""Besides what you 'borrowed' from my stash"" says Jason accepting the waffle, ""I got less than half a gram.  Here-""

 Jason tears off a dark rock, puts it in a cigarette wrapper and hands it to me.  I fold it into my wallet.  

 ""Do me a favor"" smiles Jason rubbing his skull and eating the waffle, ""don't show Kym where I hide shit.  You're bad enough.""

 ""Yeah sorry about that dude.""

 ""Its alright.  It's fucking dry out there.  I tried last night.  My sure fire girl...but man it was bad.""

 ""Why?""

 ""Remember Autumn?  Short girl with black hair and the eyebrow rings?""

 I think for a moment.  Yeah that girl who was sleeping with Jason for awhile.  Always wore a black Greek fisherman's hat.  He had a pretty big crush on her but she disappeared.  Autumn dealt heroin.  What a fucking pair these two made.  Mr. Coke and Ms. Smack.

 ""The one with the stupid hat?""

 ""Hey c'mon!"" chuckles Jason.  ""Yeah her.  I'm kinda worried about her.""

 ""Why?""

 ""Well I called the cops on her for one thing.""

 ""What?  Really?""

 ""Yeah...fuck.  It was ugly.  Things were out of control.  Caesar's guys knew about her.  She had this Seattle mail connection"" sighs Jason.  ""I don't know.  It was fucked up but dude, I freaked out.  It was bad.  Scary bad.""

 I stare at Jason's face.  The carefree parts are missing.  He looks haggard.  Grim.

 ""I didn't know what to do!  Like last time I went there I knew it was fucked.  Blood on the walls fucked.  People were using her.  She has this new guy from the park.  I just wanted to take her out of there.  But she wouldn't go.  People started shit.  It got ugly.""

 I look at the clock.  Eleven minutes to Muni.  I will have to run for it.

 ""This is between you and me ok?""

 I nod.

 ""Fuck.  So yeah.  Not sure when I can score.  I'll try again later but I need sleep.""

 ""Don't worry.  You did the right thing"" I say as I leave.  

 Jogging through the Mission in the dark.  My body aches but I keep going because this is what I need to do.  Like Jason.  He had to do it.  The part that pisses me off is how I feel about it.  Like why didn't he just score one more time before calling the cops?  I could care more about Autumn if I had one little hit this morning.  This is a junkie thought.  This is not a good feeling.  But I catch the bus.  

 ~^~^~^~^~^~^~    


I open my door.

 ""Where the fuck is Jason?"" bitches Kym miserably from the couch.

 I sigh and toss my backpack and jacket on the chair.  I was praying for a miracle.  I wanted to find Kym half nodded out on the couch meaning Jason has scored.  Not this.  Not again.  

 ""Fuck!"" I groan.  ""I was hoping...""

 ""Yeah that's great babe!  I was hoping too.  Now I'm going back to bed"" sniffs Kym.

 I look at my girlfriend.  She's walking around in tiny, ass-hugging cotton shorts with cartoon prints of panda bears eating ice cream cones.  She wears a NOFX t-shirt with the collar and sleeves torn off.  No bra so when she stands there, one hand on her hip the other waving a cigarette as she bitches at me there is no question.  She is ridiculously hot.  She cut her purple hair recently.  One side is flat from sleeping and the other side wildly points west like the winds of fortune.  

 I want her.  I want to finish my chemistry lab work that is due tomorrow.  I want to make a peanut butter sandwich.  But instead, I sit down useless, miserable and bury my face in my hands.  So ill.  So tired.  Kym turns and I watch her ass strut back to the bedroom.  I hear her fall onto the futon with a UMPFH!  I hear the comforter scrunch around between her athletic thighs before she settles, sighs and starts reading magazines.  

 I feel slightly guilty.  The 30mg oxys I took from Kym's makeup bag four nights ago have been making school sane.  I couldn't handle school dopesick.  So while I am in the unpleasant poppy netherworld where I am neither high nor sick...I have left my poor girlfriend behind.  

 I think.  Because I swear I can smell tar...Hmm.

 I go in the bedroom and lay next to Kym.  And I can smell it in her hair.  I definetly smell that vinegar, burnt bandaid, crispy foil scent we both know oh so well.  I smile and kiss her neck.

 ""What?"" she demands looking at me.  I can see light in her eyes.  Secrets.  She is daring me.  And it dawns on me.  Of course she knows I took her oxy.  

 Junkies.

 ""Oh nothing.  Just thinking.  Might be awhile before we get anything.  Jason's dealer left.""

 ""Well"" says Kym rolling over to stare at me, ""maybe it's time.""  

 ""What?  Quit?""

 ""Yeah.  I don't even get high anymore babe.  Just feel ok you know.  I miss the euphoria.  Maybe we were using too much.  Maybe we can-""

 And the phone rings.  I look down the hall and turn back to look at Kym but she is already gone.  Long legs sprinting down the hall.

 ""Hello?  Devika!  Salam, chetori!  What?  Yes!  Duh!  I gotta bunch of cash from tips and he has the rest.  Ok!  Love you sweetie!""

 Kym materializes in the doorway beaming a huge smile.  And I feel it.  Relief.  Euphoria.  Beethoven's Ode to Joy blasting from the sky.  

 ""You're gonna put out before they get here"" smiles Kym taking off her shirt.  

 Jesus.  I stare like a fool as she approaches.  Wild.  An explosion of matter echoing the creation of solar systems.  Radiant and free she falls on me and I laugh knowing only her.  Kym takes her pleasure like the Universe takes galaxies.  An abundance of energy, beauty and chaos.

 And just like that, the Darkness is pushed away again.  Coiled above us, beating his metallic wings is the god.  Circling closer and closer.

One source says that 25% reductions with a period of 10 days between them is effective, but I'm presuming that this is assuming long term use? This would have them on bupe for far longer than they've been on heroin.

Celebrities, & mainly, now-a-days, rappers 'stunting' on Twitter & other social medias about their debachoriuos & excessive lifestyles.

They most common drug that we common folk see them indulging in, besides weed, is lean. We all know that lean is a rather weak opiate, but, is basically liquid heroin, nonetheless.

Occasionally, we see them post about other, stronger drugs (asap yams, retchy p & da$h come to mind, as well as other 'blackoutboyz'), & those other drugs are usually other opiate based pills, like percs & what not.

Now, here's the funny part.. Your average fan, especially the ones with no knowledge of the 'game', see this & think to themselves: ""ohh man, how awesome!! I'd love to drink lean and smoke dope all day!!"".

But, we who know, know that it isn't what it's all cracked up to be.

First of all, they are wasting money on impotent garbage, lean, when they could be indulging in much stronger, more effective shit, but, lean is accepted, & expected, while heroin remains a big no-no.

Secondly, these guys, mainly the ones I named (rest in peace, Yams) go REALLY hard when it comes to drinking lean. So, as mentioned, kids see this & think 'how cool!!', when we know that those motherfuckers can't even take a proper shit, lmao.

I just find that halarious. 

You see the fortune & excess, but you don't see the post talking about how irregular these guys are, & how they haven't took a healthy shit in 2 months, because they are out partying on tour.

Think about it, ol' Justin Beebs sitting on his porcelain throne, about to blow out his intestines, because he's plugged the fuck up.

That's the kind of stuff normies don't realize when they're drolling over their drug-fueled lifestyles.

Tl;dr: rappers & celebs take heroin-shits, & they probably want to kill themselves because of it.",1441076484.0

I was curious if those of you who exclusively IV now ever get cravings to snort your drugs still.

I feel like if I wasn't able to do that, the high wouldn't feel ""complete"".

what do you do, when you miss a vein / hit an artery and still inject?

Yes i read the safe manuals and mostly i have success, however im still a beginner and seeking advice from advanced people.

last shot I missed, I must have hit def. an artery, the blood was more bright and not dark-ish. anyways I registered and saw blood so I thought fuck it and just injected it.

suddenly injection site and half of my under-arm is swollen as fuck up. like reallly fucking huge. I was scared shitless. somehow I managed to get to the fridge, put all ice cubes out and onto a towel. The towel was then ""taped"" to my arm and i took a xanax and ibuprofen and felt asleep.

Next morning I woke up and the swelling was gone to almost non existant. No pain - nothing. Pulled sweater over and didnt look at the arm that day.

When going to bed, I realized: the part where I failed to IV was weird-ish yellow and this was for some days.

Now lets talk about the time I failed to IV into that vein. couldnt register so I pulled it out but to this day its like a tiny little spot on my arm.

Any recommendations on what creme I should get to help with the healing for both?

I really hope you enjoyed the show last weekend and I would like to thank you for coming out but you have made that pretty much impossible. I'm not sure if you were a regular attendee of our productions or just a random bar patron but I'm sure you understand that we as performers work very hard to bring you the best show that we possibly can. We spend hours mapping and rehearsing before we spend hours more costuming and placing every last rhinestone by hand. It is a lot of work, no doubt, and you wouldn't believe how costly it all can be and then at the end.... we show you our tits! Of course it is all very fun and we simply love to delight our audiences, I bet you liked it! 

However, I will say that the biggest surprise of the night came when I walked across the parking lot and saw my shattered window sadly staring back a me like an abused animal. At first I was in total shock but somehow handled myself relatively well, all things considered. I guess that's because in that moment I felt completely.... helpless. It's a strange thing to feel helpless when one is used to being in control of their own lives, I have a feeling that you may understand where I'm coming from. Listen, I don't exactly know the circumstances as to why you had to break into my car as I can only speculate. I just know that people who are in a stable place in their lives do not feel the need to destroy a stranger's property or steal from them. It might have been because of a sick mother or a shoeless child but seeing as how you were at a bar on a Saturday night, those wouldn't be my first two guesses. Unfortunately, I recognize this behavior all too well. I can't help but to wonder if you're the same person who also stole my cast mate's phone inside that night or the person who stole the photographer's tips a few months back but I digress. I hope that whoever you are, wherever you are... You realize what a complete and total piece of shit that you are. I guess you will just have to keep praying to Junkie Jesus because, as you know, the purse that you stole didn't even have anything of value in it. BUT luckily for me, it only cost me $1200 to have my car repaired, eight days in a rental car, $125 to have a new car key made for my girlfriend, and $100 to change my house locks and as I really didn't need that $1500, I sure do hope that you enjoy that nail kit and Batman earbuds that you made off with!


So in closing, I hope you understand that I work very hard for the things that I have... I didn't always drive that Mercedes! I've come a long wayfrom that '95 Civic with a sagging bumper but it all started by getting a job and acting like a decent human being. I know you can do it, I have total faith in your abilities. I think you will soon see that being a productive human being only take a few weeks of feeling like shit before things start to get better (and EASIER!) or, you know, you can just continue being a gigantic dick to everyone that you do or do NOT come on contact with. Don't be afraid to think about the other people in this world and how your poor choices may also have an affect on them!

I've been using for around 2 years now, going between poppy seed tea and H, I've experimented with prescription drugs but to me none of them compared to PST or H. I primarily smoke or sniff H (I prefer smoking, I worry more about OD with sniffing since it doesn't hit as quickly), and I've been thinking for a while about wanting to try some other methods. 

The problem is that my veins are very very difficult to detect (a result of having small veins and being a little bit overweight), to the point where I've spent half an hour in a doctors office before a nurse could find a vein to draw blood for blood tests. Add a mild fear of needles to that and I don't really have any interest in IVing. However, I've IM injected drugs (MXE specifically) before and I feel fairly confident in my ability to do so safely. What's the IM experience like? I imagine it doesn't have the same rush that IV does, but is it greater than smoking?

Obviously, this is a throwaway account and any advice is so very much appreciated you guys. About 3 weeks ago my significant other relapsed. He has been hiding it from me but, not very well. I didn't want to be one of those people to poke and prod him continuously making him think that i do not trust him so, i kept my mouth shut until recently. 

He had been leaving little bits of cotton out. Bottled water everywhere. Black shit all over the place. Not to mention is kind, compassionate personality and the color in his eyes fading into nothing here recently. 

He has been using on and off or a long time. Id say probably a decade at this point. He currently has (as of about 4 months ago) been diagnosed with cellulitis and that gave him a reason to quit for a while (It's still not healed). Hes told me on several occasions that he wants to quit. I believe him but, he just cant do it on his own and hes convinced that he doesn't need rehab which i don't agree with at all.  He took a sub last night in hopes that it would help but, today hes in bed unable to move from being in so much pain. 

I need advise r/opiates. How can i help him? ",1441036963.0

Starting from February  1st I was clean for 94 days until I got a new job, had money, and tricked myself in believing I needed heroin to do this manual labor intensive new job.  I used for about a week and I woke up to find I could feel or use my right leg.  I went to the ER and they put me in ICU because I had what's called rhabomyalisis. I was in the hospital  for 13 days and when I got out I stayed clean.  One of the complications  of the rhabdo  was excruciating  leg pain that for the most part crippled me.  I couldn't stand up for more than 10 mins at a time.  Very bad limp and shooting pains along with not being able to sleep at night.  This has been going on since August. 20th.  I wanted to kill myself because I felt hopeless and no doctor would help me manage the pain.  Now this new doctor I have explained that given my heroin addiction and the fact that narcotics are really only given to people with short term pain, suboxone  might be the best route.  I'm currently on 1 strip per day 4 in the morning 4 in the evening.  It seems like however, albeit much better and manageable I still have pain and I feel as if I should maybe bet bumped up a few mgs higher than 1 strip (8mg).  I am not by any means getting high off of them but because I'm in pain I don't crave opiates as bad.  how should I go  about asking my doctor for a higher dose?  I read they have these 10 mg suboxone patches that seem like just the thing I'd need but just don't want to come across as seeking more as an attempt to get legally  high.

Ask the dboy(he's 33 but he really is a little boy) for a front of half the weight I usually grab, but for the same price. Mofo not only says no, but he's dry and wanted me to shoot him the 40 before he re-upped. Fuck that. So I stay home, a little bored, but not sick, hey at least I have cigarettes! 

My papa made some dank ass burgers with spinach and goat cheese and tomatoes from my mom's garden. I decided to just go out with friends and maybe smoke some herb or whatever. No ones answering, not even the nerdy dudes who I play Magic TG with. Counter strike it is. Then out of the fucking blue this guy who I know from high school(saw him at a gas station and got his number last weekend). Says he's got 140 to toss around and he's looking to get fucked up. So here i am thinking, Oh cool we'll get an oz and some oil and toke up fat. When he arrives, none of the dab plugs are answering when he says 

""Oh I am down for whatever, I didn't even want wax anyways"" 

""what did you want?"" 

""Literally anything, except uppers, I gotta sleep tonight man!"" Which is ironic because he asked me for molly earlier

Well after a little chat I realized this dude fucks around, would never have expected it, he is like straight out of the fall abercrombie catalogue. Plug picks up and is on deck. We grab some arizonas and head to trap. Turns out this dude knows my dealer and another dude in the car whom we both went to high school with( cleaning his pizzo and telling me to not poke myself, fucking knuckle-dragger) After some light business talk, we leave with 2gs, 3 temazepams(for him) and couple free grams of some fairly chronic mids. All right! only catch is we have to serve this dumb junkie bitch in a group home, because its her bday. And my friend didn't even ask for the plugs number!

Fast forward, we head home, serve miss-I-don't-brushmahteef, big surprise, she's complaining about the sack, asks if I pinched it(spoiler alert: I did XD) and I say 

""now why would I do that to the lovely birthday girl"" and make up some bs about my sisters bday being today. 

Anywho, this guy(super-cool) smokes me out with a half, and then tosses me another half for the hookup! Now Im high as a kite with a penchant for huffing paint thinner, and I got plenty for a day of fun tomorrow. And I dont even like temazepam!

Long time lurker, finally made an account. Here is a wicked story from my days of side time hustling when I was at the ol' unni. 
I worked as a middle man at my local college in that I go there and I am from the area so I know some locals in the trade. SophoroI stumbled upon a treasure left by the opiate gods : a rich kid. I don't know where he gets the money (and though he clearly has a habit, he is well kept) but it's safe to say he comes from money. Thus, for him, money didn't mean a thing. All he wants is reliability and timely, discreet  deals. He didn't ask for a discount and buys, on average, 700 dollars worth of product, 3 times week. Without going into too much details, I made 200 dollars eat time he picked up, to a tune of 600 a week.  So, pretty much i went to barely keeping my shit together to making 600 a week cash, much need capital that allowed me to expand my business. I went to barely hustling to get by to have stock of of various shit, all thanks to my wunderkid and his miracle seed money. ",1441191330.0

I'm writing this as I'm trying to fall asleep so I can get a good night before class tomorrow. Unfortunately I can't because I've got the most violent cases of hiccups I have ever had. 

I get hiccups a lot on opiates. At most I got hiccups once a month before I began using regularly, but now I get them at least twice a week. I used to think this had something to do with the way I made and drank poppy seed tea, but as of the last few months I've been switching between PST and Heroin and I haven't noticed any real change in my hiccup pattern. It's gotten to the point where I have come to subconsciously associate getting hiccups with nodding, meaning I get kind of excited whenever I get them. Is this a real thing that happens to people or am I just crazy? One friend of mine says that he thinks he might experience the same thing but he wasn't positive. 

Anyway, I guess I'm going to get up and play some Fire Emblem while I wait for these hiccups to stop. 

EDIT: 
so on wikipedia I found [a link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10202603/) to a paper but it seems to be just a summary instead of a complete paper. Not sure if the paper was pulled or what the deal is. It also seems to suggest that administration of opiates in addition to other serotonin or dopamine related drugs are very likely to cause hiccups, so possibly it's related to one of those neurotransmitters. 

Also found [this paper.](http://journals.lww.com/ajpmr/Abstract/2007/12000/Persistent_Hiccup_Associated_with_Intrathecal.11.aspx) unfortunately my school doesn't have access to the medical journal it was published in so I could only read the abstract. Basically looks like spinal injections of morphine have caused hiccups that were remarkably persistent. 

Fire Emblem Update: Chrom is the fucking star of my save right now. I paired him with Sumia and they are unstoppable. If anyone cares I'm playing on hard difficulty and forcing myself to not restart missions on deaths, like a self-enforced hardcore mode. ",1441176968.0

Monday... No sickness and I slept like a baby.

I know heroin and opiates on the whole aren't nearly as toxic for your body as some drugs can be, and still, if I can help my body out in any way I'd like to be doing it.

I'm a 45 year old woman who's in otherwise decent health, not overweight, don't eat the best food but I try, pretty average, I think.  I snort fents and oxy, I smoke BTH.  I've also been on valium for the past twenty years for a diagnosed anxiety disorder (panic disorder with agoraphobia) and am careful about that usage in combination with the rest.  To be honest I think that all my benzos do at this point is stave off w/d, they have very little effect on me otherwise but I've never gone up in dosage, I hang steady at my 2mg klonopin or 20 mg valium a day.  I often wish that someone would have given me a scrip for opiates instead of the benzos because I'm pretty sure I'm going to be on them forever.  I've tried to kick twice and had horrific problems both times, so I've kind of given up on not taking them any longer, at least in this go-round.

The only reason why I'm not shooting is because I can't get needles and I'm very scared about shit like abscesses and such.  I suppose I should be grateful.  Still, I look and kind of feel like hell lately.

Right now I take a multi-vitamin, extra B and C, a antioxidant berry extract, omega 3's, a weird mushroom combo courtesy of Paul Stamets (I really like him :) ) to help keep my immune system in good shape, and a probiotic.

Is there anything else anyone can think of that would be useful?  Would milk thistle be a good idea too?  

I hope this post doesn't sound too stupid, but I wrote in the hopes that someone else might find this kind of information useful as well.  I'm just now at a point where I think I've finally reached some sort of plateau, I can't even get to a nod right now; that's super weird for me.

TL;DR Snort and smoke, use benzos too, is there any kind of vitamin or supplement that will help my body to stay healthy?

Anyhow, /r/opiates, hope you all are safe and happy and healthy as you can be tonight.  Take care of yourselves and be well.  Peace. ",1441259474.0

When I first started using again in my current city I met a friend through the internet and he introduced me to his new found dboy. His prices were pretty good $80 buns and 2 for $120. Started going through him for ~2-3 weeks and was meeting him near or at the open markets.

I had just picked up 2 buns and went to my favorite near by parking lot to fix up and shoot. After finishing I light a CIG recline back in my car and roll the windows down. To my surprise a Puerto Rican fellow a few parking spots down was trying to get my attention saying I know what you just did there. I started getting a little scared and nervous especially when he started saying come over her man.

I got out and kept my distance locked all my shit in my car. Finally I'm standing outside the driver side door and he says you just got from over on XYZ Street right? I say yea why? He says well their shit is garbage I got that real fire. So I'm like yea? He's like yea get in. I get in the passenger seat and he shows me his supply, close to 1,000 baggies very well packed, well filled, and nice color. He gives me a tester bag and his number and a fake name (only found out it was fake at a later date when I learned his real name) and we part ways.

I rush home with my bounty feeling nice from shooting 3 bags from old dboy. I really want to get a feel for new dboy's quality so I wanted for what I did to fade as much as possible then shoot that one taste test bag and holy effing shit huge rush from one bag about ~4-5 bag equivalent to old dboy's stuff. I'm upset I just spent my money on the garbage. 

Then 8-10 hours later I realize the legs his stuff had was insane. Usually by that time I'd have been done with a bundle of old dboy's stuff and realized damn thanks to him I still have 17 bags of mediocre (a 4.5 on a scale of 10) dope. I also at this time have a tolerance from using daily for ~2-3 weeks.

Now I go to him always first, tried his coke today for the first time and 2 mins later I throw up from the huge rush and quality of both. Coke 9.5/10, Dope 9/10.",1441258998.0

Typically this is when I get the muster to sober up and put on a strong upper lip for 1-5 months at a time.  

During this periods of truthiness, I try not to lie.  I don't self-disclose imcriminating information (ie brag about drug use), but I try to be straight up with everyone I interact with.  

Quite honestly (pun intended), it is liberating!  The feeling is so far removed from the pleasure I derive from getting high, but none-the-less fulfilling.  It's very hard to describe, but I guess it's what some people take as ""finding religion.""

Of course, when I'm in the depths of my addiction, telling the truth falls to the wayside of stoking my mu-receptors.  I lie about fucking everything.  Sorry I couldn't be bothered to call because I turned my phone off (not that I was measuring out and preparing drugs to put in my asshole).  Man I really drank a lot of coffee (I'm not using the bathroom as a place to administer my drugs).  Yup it's a wheat grass supplement (not the kratom that keeps me normal between scores).  

I lie so much that it even bleeds into mundane stuff.  Where are you going?  To the store (not really, I'm going to wash laundry).  Do you want to go out tonight?  No I have another engagement with an old friend (I'm actually going to nod out on the couch after you leave, psych!)

What really bothers me is the realization that I can't have any meaningful romantic relationship if I continue to use.

It went well and I got the job! (everyone who has an interview is offered the job, lol) It's selling door to door, but I've done that before with Kirby Vacuum Cleaners, so I'm not a complete stranger to this type of thing. The money is out there folks! My first day (today), I took home about $120. We get paid out erryy day at the end of the work day. Ca$h money. I woulda took home more, but me and my trainer stopped at my DBoys house and he spotted me. So I paid him back once I got paid. There's people out there taking home $500+ per day doing this type of thing! It really is an opportunity if you're working for shit pay (like I was) or just at a dead end job (like I was).

Now that I'm making a decent amount of money, onto my next part. My old DBoy. His prices are higher, but I can finally afford the goods now, so here's a little backstory on me and my old DBoy.

This guy had really, really, really good dope. Some of the best I've had. It was pricey, but I was making money decent money at the time (less than I'm making now actually) so I thought it was worth it to pay a bit more to get better quality. He sold bags which were $20 each. They weren't double-wides, but had more than a single, but a bit less than a double. It was about halfway in between. After the 2nd or 3rd time going through him he stopped using bags and would always give it to me in a folded up receipt, or a piece of paper. I like it that way instead of bags to be honest. So anyways, funny story is that we both instantly recognized each other, but couldn't figure out from where. Then it finally clicked about my 5th time seeing him. When we both did time 5 years ago. I was put on a unit for 1 day, then transferred to another. And for that 1 day, he was my bunkie. We had seen each other 1 more time in jail when we both got sent to Keep Lock (22.5 hours locked up - Half hour for a shower, and 1 hour for rec.) I was getting out of the box when he was going in. Lol, it was funny. He said something to me about owing him a snickers (cause it was my first day and when you get a new bunkie who just got sentenced and doesn't have commissary yet, you always try and hook em up) Anyways, here is the most serious looking gangster (he really is a blood by the way) smiled and laughed so hard like a lil kid when we finally figured out we were ex-bunkies. I haven't hit him up in about 2-3 months, but I think it's over-due. I might start making him my main dude for now on since I got this sweet, money-throwing-at-me job.

(A friend going in and out of rehabs/sober livings hooked us up recently.  Let's call her ""Hanna"")  The second time, I leave and stop somewhere nearby to fix up.  He calls me and I think, did he forget something in my car?  No.  Not at all.  He says that my friend Hanna (who I thought was in rehab) was in his apartment and ODed really really bad.  She had told me previously that she is quite prone to overdose, and yet continues to relapse and continues to overdose. I went back and ran up to his place.  He was freaking out, didn't know what to do.  He put a sub under her tongue and was putting ice all over her, slapping her, trying to wake her.  She was blue in the lips and white/green in the face.  No breath.  She appeared to be dead.  So I began to fix up a shot of suboxone (for the naloxone) and I was going to IV it for her to wake her up.  Just as I was making the shot he says, ""Here!! I found it!!""  He found an automatic naloxone injector that a friend gave him a long time ago.  I pulled down her pants and injected into her outer thigh as the instructions stated.   She still wasn't waking up.  So I began to work on another suboxone shot since the narcan was all gone.  And I suggest that we bring her to the bathtub and rain ice-cold water on her.  She woke up!  Before we even gave her the sub shot.  So thank the lord for narcan.  I can't believe some places require a prescription.  It's still so surreal to me that I saved Hanna's life.

3jf7wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3jf7wr/quitting/,9,https://redd.it/3jf7wr,miles2gob4iZZZ,Quitting,"Hi all, throwaway for obvious reasons. 

A little bit of history: I am in my mid-20s and have the lower back of a 70-year-old who mined for a living. L3-S1 have no discs to speak of between the vertebrae, I have arthritis in my back, and to top it all off I have a low tolerance for pain. Not a good combination. 

My medication has been steadily increased over the past 4 years. I started off with 5mg Vicodin twice a day and have moved up to 200mcg/hr Fentanyl, up to 500mg Oxycodone a day, up to 1g MsContin a day, and I've put down two bundles in a day with no problems. In the past few months I've started insufflating Heroin as well, as my tolerance to the other medications is so high now, they barely help. 

I am sick of doing this. It's a drain on my health, finances, relationships, and mental state. I'm well aware of what comes after insufflating heroin and it's not somewhere I want to see myself. 

Finally, my question: I've been to detox before and paid 3,000$ for 4 days in a dirty room, 12 doses of Suboxone, and employees who didn't give two shits about the fact that I actually have pain that needs to be managed and were refusing to give me any OTC pain medications for my back. I want to try to get off everything by myself, starting tomorrow. 

* What 'supplies' will I need? I have heat packs and OTC pain medication for my back. What other things will come in useful? 
* How long can I expect to be going through withdrawals? 
*When will the worst come? When will the worst pass? 
*Is there anything I should watch out for? Any other advice? Words of support? Hah.

I decided to do this shit in two '.15' shots. So I prep up the first shot and I am standing there with a dude I had just met. He knew my situation about how I had been clean for a long time and yada yada. Ironically, the second to last thing I remember saying is, 'Don't hesitate to call 911 if I fall the fuck out. haha.' Apparently, inner-junkie me knew what the fuck was gonna happen. I pushed the plunger and started a normal good rush, and then I stood up and said, 'You wanna go with me to grab some smokes from the gas station?' Next thing I know I wake up in the floor covered in goddamn hella ice water and I'm looking around at 2 cops and like 3 EMT's. I begin to regain consciousness and the motherfucker sticks fucking Narcan in my nose as I am screaming at him to get the fuck off me! I was coming around already and fucking BOOM! Narcan! Goddamn pricks!! Ahh it sucked!! Not really as bad as I thought though, still super shitty. From on top of the moon to moderately sick in the push of a plunger.

The cops were being condescending dickheads the whole time talking about jail and shit. I knew they couldn't do a goddamn thing because the dope and rig were put up and they didn't have them. Finally the EMTs basically told the cops to get lost because they were making my heart rate really high and they were not needed (good guy EMTs in the end!)

I just got a half gram of some decently fire blow from my friend, and 100mg of valium + a Dilaudid 8mg & an opana 10mg IR all for FREE :3

So I've never IV'd coke before and I was very curious. So I down like 50mg of valium because I'm aware that it is one of the best benzos to combine uppers with as it is the best and most safeguarding benzo when it comes to helping reduce the chances of negative effects of uppers like cocaine. I wait for the 50mg of the valium to kick in and once it does I mixed up a beautiful IV shot of 2.5mg oxymorphone (a qtr of a 10mg opana IR) & a lovely 2mg of hydromorphone (a qtr of an 8mg dilaudid) which felt awesome being potentiated by the 50mg of valium.

After that I wait about 30-40 minutes for that to settle in a bit and I bust out the cocaine, normally I don't do uppers but since it got laid in my hands and I just so happen to enjoy some nice cocaine from time to time.... I decide to attempt to IV it, since I've never really done this before. Ohhhh boy! It was soooooooo nice, needless to say. very euphoric and MUCH better than snorting IMO. I'm about to go do another one real quick actually since this is wearing off now!

Anyone else here like the combo I'm currently on? I'm being very careful and I know my tolerance and what I can and can take safely, and this post does not by any means condone aforementioned behavior. What I'm doing is not technically safe, and I don't encourage this whatsoever. I'm thinking of perhaps tomorrow waking up to a morning shot of a either 2mg dilaudid or 2.5mg oxymorphone combined with a nice little shot of cocaine and experience a speedball for the first time.",1441348925.0
3jl4ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3jl4ml/changing_medication_from_hydromorph_contin/,9,https://redd.it/3jl4ml,HYDR0MORPH,"Changing Medication from Hydromorph Contin & Dilaudid: But to what, I ask you, r/opiates?","Good evening, fine folks of r/opiates! This is a little lengthy - I appreciate anyone who reads it through and offers feedback, but yet - there is a **TL;DR** at the bottom.

&nbsp;

So I've been talking to my doctor for about two months about switching opiates because I've been having tolerance and ineffectiveness issues with Hydromorph Contin and Dilaudid. He is completely open to this and has discussed some possibilities and even asked for my input as to if there is anything in particular that *I* would like to try.

&nbsp;

My morphine equivalent of all daily doses combined of hydromorphone are roughly between 400-500mg, depending on which conversion ratio you go with and which multiplier you use. I take Hydromorph Contin twice daily at scheduled times and Dilaudid PRN up to four times daily for breakthrough. However, I've obviously built up a huge tolerance, and given the fact that hydromorphone has an abysmal bioavailability for every ROA except for IV (which I do not do, unfortunately/fortunately, however you want to look at it), these two things combined mean that I unfortunately no longer get any benefit from taking it other than to keep me from getting sick. So, I have been waiting to finish my current script/refills at my pharmacy before making the switch to something with a better bioavailability for ROAs other than IV, but as I have no more refills left now, I need to go and see my doctor and make a decision.

&nbsp;

Honestly I've been looking into these two main alternatives:

* Morphine (MS Contin and MS.IR)
* Oxycodone (OxyNeo/OxyContin OR generic OC OxyContin and Oxy.IR)

&nbsp;

My doctor prefers to keep the long-acting and rescue/bt med as the same drug (when available). The exception is when I was on Duragesic fentanyl patches last year - which, FYI, I do not want to go back on which is why I am not considering it. It took too long to find the right dose, tweaking with multiple patch strengths worn at the same time, and then I got so fed up with the random dose overloads from heat I said F this. I was tired of nearly falling out because I went for a run and my body temperature went up, or went in the hot tub, leading to a more rapid absorption rate of fentanyl. No more of that.

&nbsp;

So, given my current MEQ doses, if I go with **morphine** I would be most likely prescribed MS Contin 200mg twice daily with MS.IR 30mg for breakthrough four times per day. I have no experience with MS Contin - what are the pills like? Is the time release stubborn like new OxyContin's, or does crushing the pill defeat the time release? I know that morphine has a reasonable oral bioavailability, or at least that's what I've heard - how effective is it? Any benefit to nasal/rectal ROA?

&nbsp;

Or, going another route, there is **Oxycodone.** The total daily dose MEQ of Oxy I would be looking at is *roughly* 250-350mg, again depending on the conversion ratio you use as there are many different ones and many claim chronic vs acute dosing MEQ ratio varies for oxycodone. Anyway, so in this case, being in Canada I have a few options. The first my doctor would *most likely* do is script OxyNeo (which is Purdue Pharma Canada's identical to USA OP OxyContin, they changed the name up here when the formulation changed for patent reasons to try and keep exclusive Oxy CR rights - and failed - but yeah, it's the same) 80mg x2 twice daily, with Oxy.IR 20mg as needed throughout the day. Now, **I know** that OP's suck. After a month I could go back with concerns about the cost, which is ludicrously high, and in Canada there is an alternative. We have *generic* OxyContin, original OC OxyContin, from multiple generic companies. The pills are identical in shape, size, colour, and dose strengths as all original OxyContin was - and yes, *just as tamper-able.* However, a pharmacy cannot dispense these generics by law unless the doctor writes a specific script for ""generic Oxycodone CR"" and not OxyNeo/OxyContin. This would give me basically OC OxyContin, but I would have the initial hurdle to jump through and then ""hope"" my doctor would allow the generic version due to cost constraints - honestly I don't see that as a problem, but it definitely wouldn't be first line before OxyNeo. Oxycodone has a shockingly good oral and nasal bioavailability which is a plus.

&nbsp;

So, with all that said, if you did read through it all - what are your thoughts? Which opiate should I switch to? Are morphine MS Contin pills simple to mess with? Which of these would be your personal choice if you were in my situation? **Or, is there something else that you would recommend that is not fentanyl?**

&nbsp;

Thanks for your time and reading this jumbo post!

&nbsp;

Cheers

&nbsp;

**TL;DR:** I need to switch opiates from hydromorphone to something with better bioavailability (any ROA except IV). Strongly considering morphine or oxycodone, which do you recommend and why or do you recommend another opiate (that isn't fentanyl)? Thanks!",1441346682.0

It's hard not to like even though you know how potentially bad it can be to like the high. You can't help but think ""wow this feels so amazing."" 

I still have some left, once my teeth didn't really hurt anymore I put the last of them a away in a cabinet hidden. Than it was back to baseline, no opiates or painkillers or anything like that. I've never had the desire for pain meds when I'm in pain and I still don't. What's happened is I feel like now I think about that high and at least once a day I feel like I really miss them. So after about a week and a half after I stoped using them I did a CWE for 20mg and it was awesome. That was two days ago and I feel that same craving again for the high.

I hate them too. But this answer I couldnt find because all I could find was people asking the same suboxone questions about how long to induct or how long before I can get high on dope. Its annoying. 

Anyway... My question.

I was hoping to get some feedback on what the first week being on suboxone is like for many people. For me I am on 8-16mg a day. Im on my third day and I have been feeling very moody and very bored and annoyed. Mood swings and all of that. My cravings are not bad but I do crave a high. Its not really for dope but just any sort of high would be great. 

Im looking for some advice also on going forward. I am going on a cruise saturday for 5 days with my family so luckily I will be having fun and not have a chance to relapse. I am not sure if I should get drunk or if that can make things worse. I have a legit xanax script I am taking with me as well as adderall so hopefully I can still have some fun. 

Edit: yeah I guess my previous drug usage is important for this too. Ive been on opiates for I guess 2-3 years. I spent 1 year doing just oxy 100mg a day habit. then with the help of my gf at the time kicked that for 6 months but would relapse every 2 weeks like clockwork. we broke up and I went back at the oxys. I used to hustle to support the oxy and my girl made me quit that. So when I went back I didnt have the money for it and quickly switched to dope. I would get a bun every other day (philly bags 14 to a bun). So I was doing about 7 bags a day of some good quality shit. I weighted the buns once or twice and a bun would be about .7-.8 grams. thats pretty standard. I was paying 70 a bun. So I was doing about .4 a day for almost a year snorting. Im the type of person that doesnt like to get loaded and instead just stay nice and high all day long. I found out that a constant supply of dope into your system makes withdrawl worse compared to people who shoot it all at once once a day.

Most are older women, and since I generally get along with elder folk better than people my own age, I got some new friends. well I went to visit my friend (I'll call her L) today. She was in an accident and lost her leg so her mobility is limited. Anyways, she asked how I was feeling today and I told her not so good but I'll be ok. She knew I was in pain and didn't want to say anything really. She usually has me help her around her house which I have no problem with at all because of her mobility and because she's my elder. Long story short after taking out her recycling and trash, I was expecting you know maybe like some pie or other baked good and coffee since I was used to that. Instead she hands me 6 10ml lortabs for free! I asked if she's needed any help with anything else for helping me out and she said just come have coffee tomorrow. Most definitely I'll be keeping that coffee date. She totally saved my ass and it's so nice not being in pain today

I remember in my high school days buying weed there were a lot of idiots like this. I remember like 8 years ago a guy I was buying weed from hit the top of the idiot list. I jumped in his car for a quick ride while he gave me the stuff. He was already smoking weed, had tinted windows, had a beat up POS, his inspection sticker was old, and his car was a mess. I even spotted a roach in his ash tray in his car. LIKE WTF dude?! How stupid can you be? When I purchase something I like to do it in a non public place, like a bathroom stall or someone's house. However, when I ask someone to do that they say no and would rather just do it in a wide open parking lot. Yeah, like it doesn't look shady when I'm parked in a parking lot in 95 degrees, jump in someone's car, and then come out 5 seconds later. I hate deals like that. It really pisses me off. Why not take an extra 5 minutes to be more careful? Like what is wrong with people. When I was using & had stuff on me. I made sure to drive extremely careful & follow every type of rule.

Several of my friends knew...mostly because I took advantage of them, fucked them around, fucked them over and basically stood on a stool in front of them and screamed ""MY NEED FOR PILLS MEANS 10000x MORE TO ME THAN YOUR SHITTY FRIENDSHIP"" - even to my best friend of a decade or more.

For the most part, even as shitty as I was to these friends, they all kept things pretty hush about me. However, I started getting distant from either a) losing interest in doing anything with them or b) fucking them over so hard that they just gave up on me. When I stopped showing up to places and people noticed negative feelings about me, questions got asked...eventually I found out that it pretty much got out I was a junkie. 

I've been cleaning myself up for the past 1.5 years - nothing but subs (down to 0.25 a day and should just fucking jump) in this time. It has allowed me to repair my finances and attempt to rebuild some of my relationships.

So I recently learned that several of my...let's call them B-team friends (A-team being best/closest) that found out I was a junkie simply didn't believe it because I got fat. I used to be really active...sports, running, rock climbing, and then I just stopped it all. They assumed I just got lazy with work and was getting fat/no interest in hanging out. They said that if I was a junkie I would have looked skinny and unhealthy, rather than looking like I ate a burger every night. So it turns out even after it got out, it still amounts to only my closest friends knowing how low I got. Little did they all know my most favoritest activity was eating a Portillo's baco cheesebuger, drinking a milkshake as big as my head and sniffing rox while I waited for the 80 I ate to kick in.

Secondly, there are three close calls I had with the police. Twice had just picked up like 60 80s and had them in a cup in the car...once stopped with a 30 crushed up on a CD case that I just set under the seat. I maintain, to this day, that because I dressed relatively nice and was fat that I got less questions/suspicions from the police. I think it's hard to tell if my eyes are pinned too because they are so dark and small to begin with...but I'm not sure about that part.

Lastly, when dealing with buys, I never once felt any suspicion or anxiety from anyone I met over the years. Everyone was always super cool with me, even people known to be dicks. I swear being fat made me like...a non threat in any way...a chill guy just wanting a fix.

Now over the last year I've lost all the weight I put on, been accused of having something wrong with me because of it, and had my car searched during a traffic stop - seriously

At first it began to hurt, then within about 5 minutes it hurt BAD. I thought it was somewhat normal and rode it out for a little longer. The site of injection was in my right butt cheek. After about 30 minutes I knew something was definitely wrong, I could not even walk and the pain was like nothing I have ever experienced. And I've been hit with Narcan and suffered precipitated withdrawal in the past. It was to the point that I was literally on the floor screaming from such intense pain. At this point I called 911 because I noticed a disgusting looking purple rash all over the right side of my ass and hip. 
    I was terrified thinking that I was going to die from the reaction. The EMT's had no idea what Vivitrol even was and the dispatcher had thought I injected myself with it! Once I got to the hospital I had been given 5 mg Valium IV, and 400mg of Toradol IV. It didn't even touch the pain.
     At this point the nurse became quite rude and angry with me due to the loud screams that had been going on before the ambulance even arrived. She and the team of nurses began to tell me to ""shut up"" and that behavior was ""inappropriate"". Of course I couldn't help it and at that point became even more angry because they were telling me how ""it was my own fault and I must have done opiates otherwise this wouldn't have happened."" I have been clean for 30 days today mind you. 
     My mother came into the room to try and calm me down and they told her they were going to call security because she was ""making it worse"". I wish I got the nurses name because I have never been treated like such a piece of shit in my life. Her attitude was ""he's a junkie, he's drug seeking, and he's just acting up to get drugs"". All of these assumptions were completely made up and I made the decision to leave AMA at that point. 
     So I told them all the go fuck themselves and that I knew my rights as a patient and ordered them to get the the paperwork to sign immediately. Again, I have never in my entire life experienced such unprofessional behavior at a hospital. I am appalled at the way these women treated me.
     Security came to escort me and my mother out after I took out my IV's and put my clothes on. So I signed ""FUCK YOU"" and on my way out tore down every display holding little paper pamphlets so that someone would have to do it after I left.... LOL.
     I am currently home and have been in extreme pain ever since I can't sleep, walk, move my leg, and can barely stand from throwing up due to the pain. I am defintely going to be issuing a law suit to every practice possible, from the out patient clinic to the hospital. I demand someone pay for what I am going through.
     Has anyone else experienced this or heard of someone who has? If so how long will this pain last? And is there anything I can do to make it any better.
     And for what its worth I received the shot at 2:18 pm EST its been 6 hours. No relief, at all.

So, for those of you with some serious clean time, how strong do you think you are? If you somehow stumbled upon a clean rig next to a spoon filled with fire, or an opana with a razor and straw, would your willpower hold firm?



Or is your sobriety relying on those situations never coming up?",1441408898.0

3joeym,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3joeym/a_surprising_little_pst_find/,11,https://redd.it/3joeym,dirtbiscuitwo,A surprising little PST find,"So there is this small independent grocery store in town that I haven't really been in to besides getting cigarettes at the cashier and 50¢ cans of soda outside. I figured it was just a store that has been there for years and hasn't closed because there's lots of housing near it and lots of people walk/bike to it. 

  Well, I decide to wander around and I notice that it wasn't a regular grocery store but they have lots of bulk food stuffs, nothing perishable. Think bulk candy,bulk snacks,short order restaurant dry storage,bulk paper products and SPICES. I take a look and see that they have 4oz containers of poppy seed for a sexy $1.09. Not bad at all.Sure I like dope the best but my tolerance has gone down tons and my last PST experience was pretty decent though it was $22 for 2lbs with shipping. This place also has 21oz containers for about $6 before tax.
 
  I just fixed up a 1.5lb batch but took some cimetadine a and waited a while before I drank it. It's been about 35 minutes and I'm feeling pretty damn decent already so I think it was a win! I have my second wash ready to go but I want to wait till the hour mark before I start sipping on it.

  I realized during the first wash that I had used a cold liquid and there might still be a good pull from the second wash, which came out just as murky as the first one. I'm feeling pretty decent though so it's hard to tell how much is in the second wash. Either way, 1.5lbs of seed for about $7 locally ain't too shabby, even if it just turns out to be okay and I'm having a lil placebo effect. I don't really get the placebo effect much though, I'm feeling pretty damn itchy and my pupils are definitely starting to constrict a good deal. Sorry this was so long, I've been fired up off my dexedrine all day : D

(i made a speedball). usual doses of both, very conservative with the girl because i really don't usually like that s much. Well, after the shot I felt itching pain all over, and my heartrate skyrocketed to WELL over 210. Right now it's about 140 resting. I'm not flipping out and overestimating: I'm a musician, I can tell BPM as well as i can tell time. so shit is scary. i've never had this sort of thing happen from a speedball, believe it or not..

so that sucked. really sucked. idk what else to say, i'm still trying to come down. definitely no more speedballs. fuck. 

edit: so what i believe may have exacerbated this---this particular sort of H we have been getting is fire as fuck, no fent, good legs, great rush, strong as a motherfucker. however, it also gives really weird pins and needles with the rush--not like morphine, more like an allergic reaction, the precursor to hives. it can be slightly painful. if it is something to do with the IgE pathways, that can cause the heartrate to rise temporarily.

That, combined with the cocaine, which I believe was not cut evenly and I think I hit a hot spot, because I measured out less than half a point (.03-.04)--would definitely be enough to spike my heart rate. not usually by that much but whew.

also, i haven't eaten anything in four days and i'm probably also dehydrated to some extent.

i will take better care of myself.

Thought I'd share some of my adventures.,"So, maybe some of you remember me as mr_oblomov, former mod of /r/silkroad and /r/darknetmarkets. Nice to see you all again.


Oblomov is a character from a Russian novel by Ivan Goncharov of the same name who doesn't get out of bed for the first 60 pages, and even then it's just from the bed to the chair.


So, have traveled a bit this year. In January bolted to Central Am: Southern Mexico (starting Cancun), Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica.


Came home. Left three weeks later on a cheap one way flight on Norwegian Airlines to Bangkok, bus straight to Cambodia, stocked up on OxyContin in Siem Reap, back to Thailand to Koh Phangan to sell smuggled MDMA to shitty, annoying partygoers. Dat psytrance doe :D. Then Koh Tao for my Advanced Diver's Cert :), then to Vietnam via Cambodia, stocked up on more Oxy in Saigon. Bought a motorbike for $250 and rode up most of the way to HaNoi, partly on train. Fell off my bike and scraped my leg. NBD. Got to HaNoi, stayed at The Sanctuary for 3 weeks (excellent hostel!), bought a possibly stolen motorbike with no blue card, sold it for 800,000 Vietnamese Dong profit, found a heroin dealer who lived under a bridge and spoke no English that hooked up that real China White. Never seen white heroin before.


Eventually decided time was up in Vietnam, flight back to Bangkok, go to Myanmar embassy, get Same-day Visa, fly to Yangon next day. Holy Shit. Talk about culture shock. Totally different from rest of SE Asia. Beelined it to Mandalay and stayed at Yoyo Lay Homestay (excellent place!). Decided to head to Lashio because it's a major heroin trafficking route. Hired a tuk-tuk for a tour of Lashio, asked him about ""Numba 4"" (that's what they call heroin in Burma...they don't even know why...lol), he gets stiff and shakes head aggressively. Changes his mind 20 minutes later and asks me ""Numba 4?"" I said ""Yes please!"" In 7 minutes no more some Chinese looking guy in a tuk-tuk pulls up, signals to hop in, don't know what I'm getting into. Says 30,000 Burmese Kyat (about $26 USD at the time). I hand it to him. He drives off leaving me in a dusty, run down residential neighborhood, mind you I'm the only white dude in Lashio PERIOD. No idea if he's coming back, lo and behold 15 minutes later he's back with a 30ml insulin bottle full of powder. Go back to my hotel room. Yeahhhh that's nice shit. Back to Mandalay, decide I want more dope and back to Lashio. Stock up on plenty, back to Mandalay. Go with some German girl to Bagan. Can't cum for shit on dope. Oh well. She swears I'm a machine. Back to Mandalay.


Mandalay--->Bangkok--->back to the States. Now I'm home. Finally got off subutex, and giving this whole sobriety thing a try. At home with my parents, under the microscope. Thinking about when I can get out of Dodge again. Wondering if I should go to synagogue for Rosh Hashanah next week. Last Rosh Hashanah went to synagogue in Barranquilla, Colombia. Think I'll go. Have a lot to atone for.


Despite all the travel, still haven't found what I'm looking for. I realize I'll never find it out there, only inside. Gonna keep searching.

It appeals to the opioid receptors in the brain and gives you a slight feeling of being high on opium. it does a great job of taking away my aces and pains from the gym or other activities. also puts me in a real nice mood. It is mentally addictive, about as bad as pot is, and is a little spend (40$ for 72, 6-8 to get an effect) but is a nice alternative for those of us who don't want to head back to the dark side of things.

apparently, speaking to people, i am having much more of a histamine reaction in addition to the pins and needles. and today it was worse of a histamine reaction than yesterday, so it's gradually getting more severe. which means, it's an allergy to some of the cut. no repeat of the heart issues because i wasn't speedballing, but i did get the usual increase in heart rate that i would expect with anaphylaxis from food allergies and such. since i have [atopic syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atopy) i develop allergies to things easily, especially with repeated exposure (the opposite of what is supposed to happen with allergies), so I am gradually becoming more and more allergic to this cut. i am going to try taking a benadryl a good 30 mins before using and seeing if that helps matters. hope it does because this is damn good dope and i really don't want to be allergic to it.

Ya ya you've probably seen the same questions every week and it's bothersome now. The thing is, it really changes when you're the one going through WDs and don't know how long it will last or whatever. If anyone can help, that would be great.

Basically, I started insufflating h about two weeks ago and just went on a binge. I've only done about a gram in that time period though. One day I started taking less and then decided to stop altogether. I didn't want to keep doing this daily, just more of a weekend or every other weekend thing.

So my last dose was Thursday morning. Just like 20mg or whatever. And I just feel like shit now. I'm just wondering, how long can I expect the body aches and stomach pains after two weeks of using about a gram? I have a little left over just in case WDs got too serious but I've managed to not go for it at all. I really don't want to. I just want to get well and stay off it for a while.

Next, for those who snort or are familiar with it in their past, how long will this scent linger in my sinuses? I pray to be able to smell anything but this heroin/vinegar smell. And periodically I get fits of coughing like there's something in my lungs. Could there be some traces of heroin somewhere in my lungs causing this?

Other than this, just basic WD questions. How can I ease it, how long I should expect pain, when can I take regular poops again.

Thanks guys",1441472994.0

So about 2 hours ago I went to the gas station across the street for smokes. Being me, I always have my eyes open for a possible cold cop situation. I see a tiny white guy with a time piece tattoo on his arm, has a bunch of cash on him, and keeps itching his face...BINGO! I wait for dude to come out and I ask him where the smoke at, just to break the ice. He immediately says, 'no smoke, I got boy though.' Well la de da, that was easy. He's staying at a different hotel and I walk with him to his room and cop 2 fat points for $40. Not the best deal, but it's chunky and looks good. Dude even had a bag of new rigs, which is a lifesaver cuz I don't have one and no car to go get one either. So I fire just shy of a tenth and I'm feeling good. Dude is being kinda paranoid and rushes me out of the room. Okay, whatev, no biggie.

I walk back to my room and after about 20 minutes I'm ready for another shot. I only did a little one over there because I legit ODed off a fat point the other day and I am still a little plunger shy to say the least. I get the dope back out and I go to grab the rig, and What the fuck! I can't find it!! NOOOO! I was wearing 'distressed' shorts and They have the fashionable holes in them, one being over the cargo pocket. Fucking rig fell out. I backtracked my steps and couldn't find it. I called buddy and he is really paranoid for some reason and he won't give me another rig. Like, what the fuck bro?? Fucking weirdo.

I need to do more, now!! So I fucking snorted the rest of the dope. This is the first time in 10 years of heroin use that I have ever put the shit up my nose. I couldn't believe it, *me*, wasting the fuck out of some fire dope.

i'm off the morphine and feel ill.  ah that pukey achy soul sucking mucky muck to remind you how dangerous addiction is.  so fun to take that to the office.  

oxy is next on the To-Do taper list.  hopefully after the morphine ER it wont be as bad...yikes.

just kidding.  i picked weed and surfing. 

almost back to strength for surfing.  close but not enough knee for stability.  need more stationary bike time, yoga and weights to rebuild.  even on a longboard it feels off and i'm terrified i'll rip open what the good doc sewed together.  but swimming is good.  back in the sea with my friends.

the high is crushing.  like wings ripped off my body and slamming down to Earth.  everything is beautiful and vibrant and oh so very real.  but not surreal.  no more dreamy euphoria.  so i am little bummed but maybe i just need to get back to smoking weed.  one thing i dont like about it is when i smoke i am done.  done with communicating, done with creating and no socializing at all.  i become passive and observe.  like watch TV instead of write or give a shit.  

guess i have to retrain my brain for the high.  hell guys like ROndo are high 24/7 and live their lives stoned.  you wouldn't know except they smirk more and have lingering scents of homegrown on their clothing.  one good thing is if i am wanting another pill for the taper and i smoke weed, i dont want anything at all. except sour patch kids.

3jw5vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3jw5vb/weening_with_kratom/,19,https://redd.it/3jw5vb,kratomExperiment,Weening with Kratom,"This is a throw-away account for somewhat obvious reasons.

I've been using various forms of hydros, oxys, and other opioids on and off for years.  I can't say I've ever had any dangerously strong addictions, but I certainly do crave them.  Meaning, I've never caused harm to get a fix, but if they're accessible I will quickly go through them.

I've been simultaneously experimenting with Kratom over the past 1-2 years and feel I have more than enough data now to plug this potential wonder drug for anyone hoping to get away from opioids (or at least looking for a backup to opioids).

I am not a doctor and cannot speak to any long-term ramifications of Kratom, but other than some constipation it seems to be pretty safe for use.  I've read a lot about it online and there doesn't seem to be any health risks associated with it.

You know that feeling you get when you've just stopped taking opioids after X-weeks or X-months of use?  Where the first few hours are ok.  Maybe even a day goes by and you tolerate it.  But then you have to have it.  You feel sick.  You feel tired and bored.  It's miserable.  I know the feeling well.  I can't imagine what heroin users experience.  I have found that ingesting Kratom during this period makes the withdrawal symptoms almost entirely disappear at best and entirely manageable at worst.

So then you might ask, why exchange one chemical for another?  Simple.  It's easy to stop using Kratom; for whatever reason it doesn't create those same withdrawal symptoms we're referring to here.  Essentially I use it long enough to combat the cravings that come from opioid dependency.  Once those go away (maybe a week or so at most in my case), I find it's very easy to stop using Kratom without any significant negative experiences and/or emotions.  It will definitely disturb your bowels for a couple of days, but such is the life of opioid-esque use in general.

AFAIK Kratom is completely legal in the US.  It's my understanding that the FDA is trying to regulate the import of it, but that has not changed the legal status.  It is definitely not scheduled.

I have found it in pill form in headshops, but these have proven to be wildly ineffective at what I have described above.  Perhaps I haven't taken enough, perhaps have bought the wrong kinds, or perhaps they just don't work.  I really don't know, but I would not personally recommend them.  

Instead you have to find people who purchase the leaves (from Thailand or otherwise) and do a full chemical extraction.  You can do it yourself, but I'm told it's a ton of work.  They use alcohol to extract the chemicals and then typically bottle it with coffee flavorers.  The flavorers allow it to be consumed, but it's still pretty bitter tasting.  Usually 1oz of the extract works wonders for me, but this seems to be a varied number based upon age, weight, sex, and likely opioid experience/dependency.  Some of my friends will use 2-3oz.

The effects are somewhat similar to hydros and the more you drink, the more you'll experience it.  It can be a bit more disorienting than a typical opioid - in this sense more like alcohol than opioids, but it's not necessarily significant.  You'll still experience that warming sensation, that calming sensation, and that relaxation sensation -- just not as strongly.

Anyway.  I don't grow Kratom, extract it, or distribute it.  I have just genuinely found it helps the nasty side of opioid withdrawal.  I usually make sure I have some at my house any time I start using pills so that when they run out (or if I can't get more), I have a backup to smooth the transition out.

I'd be happy to answer any questions about them over the next day or two with this account.

**tl;dr: Kratom extract (not pill form) can be used as a really great transition away from the withdrawal symptoms of opioids.  I highly recommend it to anyone getting away from opioids or simply experiencing withdrawal because they can't find product.**",1441571184.0

I missed a shot two days ago (in the crook of the elbow) and I did everything that you are supposed to do, hot water, compress, keep it clean ect.
Well I woke up this morning and my arm was swollen and it hurts really really really bad. I can't move my arm in certain ways because of the pain. I've put ice on it and that is helping some.
I don't have health insurance and it's Sunday so a lot of the free clinics are closed. Where do I go to get treated where I don't have to pay the same day? I called I walk in clinic and they said that it would cost $275 and that would be due at the end of the visit. I don't have $275. I would be able to pay it if they billed me later. 
What should I do?? I need help fast. Should I go to the emergency room? I know they can't deny services but I also don't want to end up with a several thousand dollar bill at the end! Please please help! 
I'm on NYC if anybody knows a specific place that's open today. I really don't feel like I can wait until tomorrow.
Thanks guys! 

Edit: I went to the er, they tried to drain it but they said it was too early and there was no pus. Which I don't quit understand because of the amount of swelling. They gave me antibiotics and now we wait and see. Either the antibiotics will push the infection to the top or they will dissipate the abscess completely. If they push the infection to the top I have to go back and have them drained again.

  i love preparing the shots.. its became a ritual.
 she's got her spot, on the toilet, I'm in mine, leaning against the tub, she's already done before i start. i pause to look at her nod, long brown hair covering half her face, mouth ajar, i wish shed stop taking xannax before we shoot. I've lost so many friends that way.. i take my shot then express my concerns, its fine, she insist, its so hard to O.D. like you really have to try.  She makes a good point, we've pushed the limits lately and been fine.. suddenly she starts crying. i ask whats wrong.. ""sean"" she replies..  i knew i  shouldn't have brought up death... her friend had died 2 weeks prior, drowned after saving his friends in a kayaking disaster.  ""i can't believe ill never see him again.""
""i know it sucks.. losing friends is always a horrible experience."" i pause, wondering if any of my own loses would be appropriate to console her, realizing all my dead friends were overdoses, suicides, and murders, i decide against it. ""life sucks princess, I'm sorry"" i say, rubbing her leg.
the crying stops, she's looking at me, ""Do you even feel?""she asks..
""what? how is that even a fair question?"" i ask as i feel my heart drop a little. ""of course i feel."" i say confidently, but inside I'm panicking.
""look at my eyes, they look different when I'm sad, don't they? they change when I'm happy, you can see a difference, right?""

""yours don't, you have the same look in your eyes all the time, wither you're laughing, crying, or just sitting there""

""you're a sociopath; aren't you?""
there it is.. time froze; I'm thrown back in time, to third grade, I'm sitting in the classroom staring at the teacher in the front of the room, she's talking about emotions, different ones and the effect they have, and the feelings they give you.  the rest of the class seems to be on the same page, but i don't understand; i mean, i get it, but i don't feel these things the way she's describing, they seem dull to me, like the teacher is exaggerating.
my minds racing, i can't answer her question, i can't speak, how does she know? my hands start shaking and i make my way to the bed, and lay face down.  i don't know how she does this.. reads me like an open book, I've only know her a few years, yet she can pick me apart better than a therapist that worked with me for a decade.
she sits on the bed beside me and puts her hand on my back, ""am i right?"" i nod my head, i still can't talk. I'm in complete shock.
she grabs my face and i look at her, ""whats wrong?"" she asks, i start crying, not audibly, but the tears are running, i haven't cried in months, its not too normal for me.
""its ok"" she says ""its not your fault, its the doctors that put you on that medicine"" talking about the a.d.d medicine i was on from elementary school until sophomore year. ""it stunted your development, I'm sure it affected a lot of things.""
was that supposed to comfort me? i feel like she started crying earlier just to bring this out of me, like she's known and has just been waiting to ask.
""why are you so upset? is it because i asked?"" i shake my head no.
""is it just weird that i knew?"" thats it, so i nod. there is a strange sense of relieve, getting that off my chest, admitting it to someone i love and trust, sharing this dark burden I've hidden my whole life.
im not sure if it was the medicine that did this to me, or if i was born this way, but i won't tell her that. I'm worried enough that she knows; who could love some one like me?  I'm smart, kind hearted, and fairly self-less, but inside I'm a monster, I just fight really hard not to let it out.

Four burn on the coffee table and one illuminates the hallway.  You can buy these candles at any store in the Mission.  They burn forever and have psychedelic portraits of martyrs and deities painted on them.  Burning brightly in the darkness, they are an amazing thing to stare at.  

 They shut off our power again.  Paying is Jason's task.  Every month he is supposed to take our combined cash to the office downtown.  It's literally half a block from his job at the bakery.  And Jason swears he has done this...So the real question is When?  The answer might not conform to the due date printed on the bill.  

 But I leave him alone.  Though the lights are off, we are high which is better than electricity.  Besides, Jason is a master at trade.  He can pawn the TV and while you curse for two or three days he always returns.  He returns with cocaine, heroin, cash and a new TV.  Often better than the one he stole.  Now that we've bitched about the lights, I know it will resolve itself.  The gnomes in his head are already plotting.  

 Besides, being in the dark is not so bad.  We huddle together like monkeys in the forest canopy as the sun sets behind some distant mountain.  We have long conversations about nothing.  Kym and I definitely sleep better without a TV to stare at and Jason tones down his personality to match the gloom.  It's relaxing.

 We are a happy family.  Jason brings us cocaine and best of all heroin.  I add psychedelics to the household and weed.  My chemist friend's closet is full of cloned, hybrid marijuana strains.  I can score MDMA and oxycodone at school.  Kym brings order.  Since her arrival, the bathroom and kitchen are no longer disgusting places to tread fearfully.  Her presence means food in the fridge, toilet paper and soap in the bathroom and coffee and cigarettes to start your day.  

 Tonight she brought home leftover sandwiches from the farmer's market in the Ferry Building.  Kym trades coffee drinks for food.  She even got a paper bag of freshly fried garlic potato chips with sea salt and pepper.  Gorged on roasted turkey and ham we all sit and stare at the cartoon glow of Mexican saints beneath dancing candlelight.  

 Marijuana is constantly smoked in this house.  It's there as a gift.  Usually a big bud on the communal coffee table with scissors, papers, Kym's glass pipe or my bong.  When Jason is home, you will get coke.  As a coke dealer, he always has it and often we get to taste before it's cut.  And heroin.  We all love heroin.  Lately that one has been taking center stage.  We snort it, smoke it and Kym thinks Jason shoots it...fuck I hope not.  

 The oxy pills are growing in popularity which I can get through school friends.  As a middleman, I could take a cut but never do.  Kym fucks my brains out and Jason gives me coke.  I pass my savings on to them.  Oxy is a wonderful hangover cure and excellent for coming off psychedelics.  Kym takes them at work and I have started doing this too.  MDMA is mostly a Kym thing.  She prefers it over coke when going out.  Jason and I gobble psychedelics and enjoy the weird.  Kym...not so much.  But she will drive us around when we're tripping and babysit us.

 The bong has a joint Kym rolled shoved into the stem.  As it burns, we do some lines of coke.  Jason rattles his vicodin pills for the ""injury"" he got at the bakery.  He admitted to us he just sorta stumbled into a rack of rolls like a fool.  But his boss saw.  So Jase played the hurt card.  The problem with people like Jason is they actually read the Employee Handbook before signing.  Rather than risk a drug test he would fail, Jason instantly cited wet kitchen conditions and demanded an ambulance.  While nothing was broken, his ""injury"" was documented and he got vicodin and temporary disability checks.  These checks and the time off helped launch his cocaine career.  

 ""Best thing that ever happened to me"" sighs Jason popping a vicodin. 

 He shares these with us, but I prefer the oxy.  Vicodin is a lazy, TV watching drug.  If anything, I miss the fresh bagels he used to bring home more than the vicodin.  I wonder if the days of fresh baked goods is over?
            
As if reading my mind, Kym asks, ""Do you still work at the bakery?""

 ""I think so"" shrugs Jason.  ""But my disability wears off next week.""

 ""You gonna limp in again and do your act?"" asks Kym as she nestles into me on the couch after passing the bong to Jason.  

 ""Nah.  Three time's the limit.  I'm gonna call on Monday and tell them I'm still sore.  Maybe they can extend my disability another week.  I'm over the bakery.  Make way more dealing in clubs.""

 Kym takes a cigarette I had behind my ear and lights it off a candle.  She takes a drag and hands it to me.  

 ""Why don't you tell them you're sore but WANT to get off pills?"" says Kym.  ""If you're lucky, they'll give you a taper program.""

 Jason stares at Kym.  ""And...?""

 ""And you get more disability AND pills for the taper.  Duh.""

 Jason stares at Kym and then slowly smiles.  

 ""You are the Devil's Daughter.  Why do I even try and compete with you when it comes to deceit?  That's like something a responsible adult would ask.""

 Kym shrugs and takes back the smoke.

 Jason pulls out some colorful balloon balls of tar and we start unraveling them.  Crazy to think how people die and kill each other for these little balloons of black crud and how Jason just tosses them on the table like no big deal.  A moth flutters by as I peel a red balloon.  It bounces off my ear and in a clear voice it sings, ""Wait!""

 Startled, I look around.  Kym is giggling at something Jason said as she folds some foil for smoking.  Neither heard the moth.  Heard?  I think about all the acid I have been taking.  Moths do not talk.

 We do two rounds.  Mediocre stuff.  But even crappy heroin is heroin.  By the time we start smoking cigarettes, life is serene.  The room is hushed and the shadows begin to shift as each lungful of tobacco brings the dragon on heavier and heavier.  

""Man I want to watch Northern Exposure"" whines Kym as she draws up her knees and sighs.

 ""Life without TV is not so tragic"" I say tracing my fingers down her knobby spine.  I linger at her bra, she smiles and elbows me.  

 But it does suck missing Northern Exposure.  The TV is like our primitive fire pit we gather round at the end of the day.  Stare into the flames and zone out on some sitcom about Cicely, Alaska. 
 
There's no beer but we have rum.  Without power, all of Kym's Odwalla orange juice is going bad so we make drinks.  

 ""That necklace"" says Jason who attempts to dignify himself after he just got caught staring at Kym's chest, ""is that like an antique or something?""  

 He smirks at me and pretends to be serious as Kym lifts up her ancient, silver medallion.

 ""This?  Oh there's a good story here"" Kym says leaning over the candle until her face is illuminated like an evening star.  ""My grandmother taught me this story.  Probably the first time this has ever been told in English.""

 Kym raises her eyebrows at us and lifts the silver necklace off and holds it above the flames.  She is dressed all in black.  A form fitting, long black skirt with a matching long sleeve turtleneck.  A black scarf is tied over pink hair.  Her face and hands glow like ivory as her outfit keeps melting into the shifting candlelight.  

 ""Look"" she commands.  ""Mithra!  He is sacrificing a bull.  But look at the blood.""

 Detailed in the silver but worn smooth from time, you can barely make out sticks with circles falling from the bill's neck.  Beneath it, a crowd of faceless people all reach up.

 ""Flowers.  The bull bleeds flowers.  And this is why.  The city was plagued by the 1,000 sons of the Night goddess Nyx.  The Oneiroi.  They caused sorrow and destruction to the inhabitants of the city.  They slip into a dreamer's body and cause pain.  Pain leads to madness.  Horrible crimes were committed and the city crumbled.  Buildings burned, laws and gods were forgotten, families were murdered.""

 Kym pulls the necklace back over her head and moves closer to the flame to light a smoke.  As she draws fire into the cigarette, her eyes slip into the dream.  She releases her breath and the flame illuminates the room for a moment.  Shadows shatter as the moths crowd closer to hear.

 ""Why?  Because Nyx was jealous!  Her temple in the city was small, plain and untended.  People fear the night.  The goddess was left to wander alone in her dusty ruins.  When night falls and Lady Darkness arrives, she draws her veil of stars over the tired city"" says Kym as she pulls her scarf down.  The material swallows her pink hair in Darkness and only the moon glow of her face is left as she stares into the candles with her wide blue eyes.  

 ""The temple of ocean goddess Thalassa was huge and prosperous.  The city's power lay in trade so native sons and foreigners alike gave her their coin.  And Mithra...well Mithra was the spread down to the Romans.  The Mithraic mysteries were known from the baker boy who tends the night fires to the future Emperors of Rome.  This was a cosmopolitan place.  Gods from all over the world were worshipped here.  Temples both large and common were plentiful.  Plentiful for all but Lady Night.""

 ""I love this shit"" smiles Jason as he lights a joint.  ""When I'm high you're better than TV.""

 ""Almost a compliment"" says Kym.  

 Jason passes me the joint and I can't help it.  When she tells stories, her sexuality oozes from her persona.  I pass her a lungful in a kiss just to feel her lips.

 ""Ok.  Ok"" mutters Jason.  ""You can do that later.  More story!""

 ""Nyx grew bitter.  In her sorrow she was visited by her eldest daughter Miseria.  Miseria described the jeweled statues, rooms of gold and marble cisterns full of crabs and fish in Thalassa's temple.  She spoke of all night revelries in the ivory halls of Mithra.  In the silent shadows of her decaying temple, the goddess Nyx wept.  But when her daughter left, misery turns to rage.  She called for her 1,000 sons of sorrow. The Oneiroi.  From the womb of the Earth, the smiling sons entered the city and slipped into the hearts of dreamers.  The Madness and Terror began.""

 And Kym stops as Jason prepares more foil.  The oval of her face nestled in the blackness of the scarf follows his movements.  Her high cheek bones and glittering eyes remind me of her desert blood.  Her smooth white hands appear and the Dragon is worshipped.  Another hit to push away the pains of tomorrow...candlelight is captured like starlight in the foil.  Kym's eyes close briefly and flutter as the god takes her.  She sags and I catch her.  As if the price of this night is still unpaid, Kym's eyes open.  She sits up, gathers the scarf closer to her face and though her voice is barely a whisper, she continues.

 ""Parents forsake their children.  Family honor crumbles to dust.  Commerce slows as everyone heeds the Night.  Nyx walks proud.  The city no longer cares about the day.  Only the pleasures of the night.  The Oneiroi run like a plague through the people and the city begins to die.""

 Jason leans closer to hear and Kym moves into my lap and melts in my arms.  I hold her limp form as she looks up and continues.  Her voice a whispery growl.

 ""Mithra sees his great city washing away in the sea of Nyx.  The balance is gone.  It has always been wrong and now he must change it or all shall be lost.  Like the sun that grows wheat for his people to eat bread, the stars must be honored too.  Mithra gathers his priests.  Nyx is to be honored in every temple.  All must acknowledge the Night.  Her likeness and altars are to burn in every place of worship.  And they do this.  Nyx is spread throughout the city and grows even more loved"" sighs Kym.  

 I can feel her nodding.  Slipping into the dream.

 ""But her 1,000 sons still run wild.  She tries to call them back but they enjoy the pain of mortality.  They delight in the fevered dreams and screaming madness.  So Mithra calls the Flower God from his cave.  This flower gift is so powerful, it can soothe the Oneiroi.  The Flower God lives in the lands of Nyx.  Nyx embraces him as a lover for his love is the pleasure of all gods.  So the Oneiroi return the the Darkness.  But the vengeful sons wait.  They know the gift of the Flower God is a cursed thing to mortals...""

 ""Wait.  Your grandma talked about opium?"" asks Jason.

 ""No.  When I heard the story as a kid it made no sense.  But as I grew older I made the flowers poppies.  Maybe that is what the story meant.  I don't know.  But her story is now my story.""

 ""So it's like science triumphing over supernatural beliefs"" I say as Kym lines my arms perfectly in the gloom.  ""Like a cautionary tale about opiates?""

 ""No.  That's not even close"" sighs Kym in a dreamy voice.                     

""Hey what time period would you have liked to live in?"" asks Jason exhaling a plume of smoke across the candlelight.

""Ancient Rome"" I answer immediately.  ""Like when Trajan was Emperor.""

""Roaring 20's.  Paris"", smiles Kym striking a silly, dramatic pose.

""Boring!"" says Jason.  ""I wish I could have partied with Motley Crue.""

I stare at Jason knowing he can't see me in the gloom when I lean back on the couch.  So I move forward so my perplexed face enters the circle of candlelight.

""That's the stupidest thing you ever have said.  You ARE old enough to have done that!""

""No dude!"" complains Jason.  ""We were still in high school when they peaked!  Like now I could party with them but I already missed their golden age!  The cocaine, heroin, whiskey, g-string age!""

""We have cocaine and heroin here"" laughs Kym.  ""You can borrow one of my g-strings if you want.""

""You shit on Rondo when he played his Pearl Jam CD but you want to wear makeup, girl's underwear and listen to Motley Crue?""

""Motley Crue IS heroin dude.  No one admits it, but everyone parties with it.""

""Yeah..."" says Kym looking at me slyly, ""You have a Dr. Feelgood tape.""

""It's uh, not mine..."" 

 ""What about you?"" asks Jason.

 ""Yeah tell us something babe"" smiles Kym squeezing my thigh.

 ""Like what?  I'm studying acceleration rates to better understand gravity.""

 ""No!"" barks Jason.  ""Boring!  Tell us a story.""

 ""A story?""

 ""Yeah babe.  Tell us something from your mysterious past"" she says in a dramatic voice and then giggles.

 ""Let me think.""

 I lean forward as Kym drops back to stretch out on the couch.  Jason kicks out his legs and lays down on the floor.  Both of their faces slip from the pools of candlelight and are swallowed by the gloom.  Only the glow from their cigarette tips whispers that they ever existed.  

 ""Ok.  Let me tell you a story...""

Then went away until june. I came back and was good until about July when I started using everyday again... now here I am feeling like I am addicted again. 

My mother found dope baggies and old used foil in my room, and also found out I had taken my step father's tools and pawned them. She threatened to call the cops, or told me i could go to detox. So detox it was obviously, but last time i went to this detox I had them take me to the hospital where i never signed in and ran away... but this time i went in super high just watched TV and nodded out, i woke up the next day just fine not in withdraws. I kept telling myself and them that i wouldn't get sick and lied about when the last time I had used was. So after being in there for about 18 hours and not yet being sick, i had come up with this story about only using a few times a month and how I only went to avoid my mother getting me a ticket. They believed me and i was discharged by 3 in the afternoon. And of course once i got out i went and got myself some dope. 

But now I need to stop really badly as my life is/was going great and I have lots of wonderful opportunities available for myself, but I have this terrible problem of wanting nothing more than to shoot heroin. Oh god I dream about it all day  every day, the whole idea seems amazing! I have these big beautiful thick veins just perfect for hitting.  I want that rush everyone talks about I want to nod like never before. Something about it seems so romantic, so intimate, like I already love heroin I feel like this is how you really show your love for it. But I know the destructive dangerous possibilities and problems associated with making this jump.

So do you think I could possibly shoot dope once or twice and then stop using, or will I just be fucked that I crossed that line. I do have a terribly addictive personality. And I'm sure this all sounds so stupid but I can't help it. Plus this family  here on this sub have/has always been more than honest and helpful about everything I have ever shared with you all. So any insight would be wonderfully helpful thank you.

Oh on a side note junkie Jesus looked upon me for the first time ever last Thursday when I went and hopped in the dope man's car and in the back seat on the floor I found two gram balloons. So I got 2.5 G's for 25$ I was so happy I got high as fuck that day:)drooled all over myself hahah!!",1441682481.0

Really bad idea?

I currently have zero opiate tolerance. I took 5mg percocet at 12pm EST and another 5mg around 9pm EST. I am looking to extend my high for tonight.

With all that said, I've heard/read of people taking small amounts of suboxone (not sure how small) on top of opiates and feeling the effects as opposed to being slingshot into withdrawal. Something about it not being enough suboxone to rip all the opiates out of my receptors, which would kinda make sense if you're on a low dose of opiates, maybe you have more receptors the suboxone would rather fit into than the ones the percocet are occupying.

Does anyone with experience with suboxone and opiates have any advice they can give me? I am out of percocet. ",1441681788.0

Eating opiates can be very comfortable but you sacrifice the rush and speed. 

Snorting it kicks you fairly fast and for me I get great nod dreams while snorting, lasts a good amount. Gotta deal with the drip that can lead to Nasea, I also get the most itching while snorting. Which can be good or bad depending on my news. 

Shooting, the best rush but you sacrifice legs.

So my question is does anyone combine multiple RoA's to get all the perks?

Will my tolerance just continue to grow at the same rate or does it plateau and start to slow down at some point? For example, if this daily habit continued, is it conceivable that I would have to sniff 1.5 - 2 buns in one sitting to get high? And after that, would it keep growing forever?

Gov thinks that if they make pain pills hard to get, yes, people will turn to dope but there will not be any newer addicts.

Right now, there are states being crippled by the heroin epidemic.  Will it ever get better?  Or will the USA for the next few generations be known as heroin using country?  

Its so easy to score dope if you live in the right place, which is great if you're an addict but terrible if you are in recovery...Silk City, Brick City, NJ...i'm talking to you...NYC, jeezus.

for as long as i can remember, i loved timing my first shot/line/whatever of the day with the perfect song for the moment. does anyone else do the same or am i as weird as i think?

my current song of choice is: https://soundcloud.com/domdolo/okay-prod-steffen-oshiki-drip

right at 1:03 is when i try to time my shot to hit. if i can get it right, i forget that i'm on this planet for a brief moment and find true nirvana.

The lyrics up until that point are quite negative, but at the 1:19 mark they suddenly take a turn, with the artist reassuring the listener that everything will be okay (in this world of mine).

My apologies to the true audiophiles out there, my choice in music may not appeal to all of you, which is fine, but I'd love to hear what you all listen to to set the scene for a great high.

Also, here's another one by Legacy if anyone enjoyed the song posted above: https://soundcloud.com/domdolo/time-ft-telana-prod-nimbus


EDIT: Anyone else have any feedback on the songs I provided? I feel as though sharing music is a great way to get a bit of an insight into each other's real personalities that are sometimes lost in spoken language, or via text (deep i know), so I really enjoy hearing your opinions, the good and the bad.

Obviously that piqued my interest. Apparently, the dealer was bragging to my friend that he (dealer) ""works with"" his local police department and that PD lets him continue his business because they're after ""the bigger fish."" This dealer's not just middling or selling a few grams here and there; he probably goes through a piece or two a day. And this city isn't tiny, but it's quiet enough that I would think they care enough about someone who moves as much as he does. Actually, I think any city would want to eradicate any drug-related activity, especially dope, but that's beside the point...


I guess my question is: how likely is it that this dealer is actually a rat? I 100% do not believe that his city's PD is ""okay with"" him selling dope, but it's possible he's worked with the police in the past; I've driven this guy (the dealer) a few places one-on-one before, and he spent a good portion of those drives running his mouth about how many times he's been busted, but how little time he's ended up doing, so it would make sense if he flipped. And this guy's proven himself to be a little bitch about stuff in the past; there have been a TON of situations that left me shaking my head, but a recent example is when I called him out on shorting me a substantial amount, he ignored me for a day rather than being an adult and addressing me directly (he eventually made it right). I just can't get over the fact this dealer would mention to his runner/homie that he was a fucking rat, especially if it wasn't true. I'm not worried for myself necessarily (I'm just your average consumer, and I know LEOs are looking to go up the chain, not down), but, if it's true, I don't want to keep giving my money to this guy out of principle.

As some of you know, Bill A4431 in NJ is currently in committee, and it will be discussed soon!  The NJ legislature is done its summer recess and the Law and Public Safety committee will meet sometime in the next week or two.  This means that A4431 could pass the committee and be voted on by the NJ Assembly sometime very soon.  For those who don't know: this bill would criminalize kratom and possession of even a few grams could land you in prison for years.

So, those of us in NJ need your help! If you live, or have ever lived, in NJ please write to the Law and Public Safety committee about why kratom should not be banned!  Even if you don't live in NJ, write to these people!  We need to show that there are *people* who truly benefit from this plant! A good place to start would be [emailing Charles Mainor](http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/bio.asp?Leg=322), the Committee Chairman. Hell, call Mr. Mainor at (201) 536-7851 if you want!  [Gilbert Wilson](http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/BIO.asp?Leg=325) holds the Vice-Chair.

Other states have chosen *not* to ban kratom after similar bills were presented in their legislatures, and the victories came from people like us speaking up! We can keep kratom legal, but only if we make our voices heard!

Some good talking points include:
-No one has ever died from a kratom overdose
-It is important that we keep kratom out of *children's hands* but an outright ban is unjust
-Kratom benefits many people struggling with pain and addiction

I personally really believe that stressing the part about keeping kratom away from kids could go a very long way.  Every politician is going to want to keep the kids safe, so I think we should advocate an age restriction.  But, we need to assert that full-blown criminalization will take away our liberty and make criminals out of law-abiding citizens!

Any and all help is truly appreciated! 

Thanks guys! :D

And I can't stop laughing.","So this weekend with family, my 14 year old cousin and myself got reacquainted. It's been a while since I've saw her so it was nice to hear about school and shit. 

A couple of hours later, I go into the changing house by the pool (everyone is at my grandparents house, enough for her to slip away and no one notice) to change into my street clothes and I walk in to witness her have some random guys dick in her mouth. I find out its her boyfriend and remembering being that age I just lectured her myself about sex blah blah blah. Whatever. She's a tramp. I gently remove him from the property and explain that I'm not gonna say anything. He was cool about it and left. 

About an hour later I went to go take my baclofin cos I could feel everything starting to ache. So i eat 3 and go about the gathering. About 45 minutes later, I get that warm, fuzzy, I love everyone feeling in my stomach. Really fucking confused knowing that I didn't have any hydros or percs left, I went and checked by bottle. Sure enough 15 of my remaining 50 baclofin were now norco 10s. (For those of you who might call bs, baclofin are only slightly longer than white hydro 10s). 

I was stunned. Where the fuck did those come from? Brushing it off as a JJ I enjoyed my high and continued to talk everyone's ear off. Then I see my cousin. Who looks absolutely fucking confused as to why Im talking to our uncle and shyly tries to scurry off. Ha bitch. No. And at this point it had been a couple of hours since her whoremoment. 

I corner her as I smoke a cigarette behind the shed and ask her what her problem is and why she's shocked to see me. Apparently she took my pills and her mom's pills and switched them because ""they're super strong painkillers"" and ""she wanted to make sure I didn't tell her mom"". I started laughing. So fucking hard. Like, tears in my eyes, hard. My cousin tried making me overdose on norcos. As shes sitting there balling her eyes out, I make her a deal. We drop it. I keep the pills, she keeps the boyfriend and everything is fine. She looks me dead in the face as I have this Cheshire grin on my face and responds YOURE SUPPOSED TO DEAD WHAT ARE YOU A JUNKIE? So I retorted, i caught you on your knees, what are you a whore? 

Needless to say we avoided each other the rest of the party.

Tl;dr- caught family with dick in their mouth. They tried to murder me with hydrocodon. And I got 15 free norcos. 

Edit: after reading the concerns about how fucking crazy this really is, I'm going to heed your guy's advice and talk to my aunt. My junkie brain was so pumped about the free pills that I didn't process what actually happened. I'm going to try to figure out the best way possible. ",1441754737.0

Yesterday I came into a lot of money, to celebrate me and my boys went and picked up a half which I paid for and was sharing with them cause I love the fuckers.

Anyways this is the same batch to my knowledge that we have been doing the past two nights with wild success. 

I do my first shot of the night and it's wonderful, we go to the store come back, I snort a little, smoke a little. 

Now I open a new bag to make another shot and it looks heavier then the other bags, which fills my heart with glee. Now at this time I couldn't tell if there was a color difference in this new heavier bag, but thinking back it might have been greyer when the other bags were more of a tan color

Anyways I make up a shot and go to town, next thing I know I feel like I'm having a psychotic break down,  my friends said I kinda Feinted then instantly came to, I poorer enough sweat in 30 seconds to soak my shirt, I was having trouble seeing and my ears were ringing so loudly I couldn't hear anything for like an hour. I tried vomiting to quell the intense nausea but I couldn't make anything come up like I usually can. And the more I tried to vomit the more my heart hurt.

It was so much like a bad trip that I thought maybe it was cut with some diphenhydramine or something, but It didn't effect either of my boys the way it did me, is it possible that this was just an odd for of overdose? I've had cotton fever before it def wasn't that. I was using new rigs and cottons. 

Tldr; did shot, felt good, did second shot, psychotic break, blurred vision, profuse sweating, loss of hearing/ringing of ears, heart pain and nausea. Cut with something or weird overdose?",1441893066.0

They come sterile in a package and aren't meant to be reused, as the needle itself can bend or grow dull, the sterility is compromised, etc. However, everybody runs into a situation where they are on their last ""rig,"" (Slang for the needle/syringe itself.) and running to Walmart, CVS, or the needle exchange isn't possible...so you make do.

Note: The word ""register"" as used in this story refers to the act of inserting the needle into your skin and gently pulling the plunger back to draw blood into the barrel of the syringe and ensure you are injecting into a vein as opposed to muscle tissue. ""Bevel"" refers to the uneven cut in the point of a needle so it is designed to be inserted more efficiently. [See here.](http://www.medtrng.com/cls/Image150.gif)

Hope you enjoy. This occurred sometime in March of 2015.

Note: Sorry to refer to snorters/smokers as ""pussies."" Y'all just don't know what you're missing, and y'all should keep it that way.

________________


A third of a gram of black tar heroin in a baggie next to me, and one rig with a sharp enough point to work. Single-use doesn't always work when your all money is going to heroin in the first place, so this one has been used 5 or 6 times.

Inspect needle. 30 degree bend to the left. Bevel indistinguishable.
Bend it straighter delicately against the bathroom counter. I'm not going to snort or smoke this shit like some fucking pussy. 

Relatively straight point. Pull back on the plunger. Audible squeak.

Rinse gently with warm tap water. Pull plunger. Less audible squeak. Bingo.

Drop chunk of tar into the spoon. Add dash of cold tap water. Stir. Apply flame to the bottom for a few seconds. Stir. Mud-brown liquid in the spoon. Pull the end off a Q-Tip and drop it in the spoon. Oh-so-soft plunge into the cotton as it soaks up the heroin. God help you if you blunt the tip against the spoon. Pull back slowly on the plunger to draw the heroin into the barrel. More audible squeak now. Oh well.

Fill the barrel. Flick the air bubbles to the top and push. 

Align point on crook of right elbow. Find a relatively clean spot in your vein. Gentle push. Firmer push. Sink. Pull the plunger for the register. Draw back air.

Slight adjustment, then sink again. Draw. Dark red floods the barrel. Go time.

Plunge. No give. Firmer plunge. No give. Breathe in.

Careful not to disturb the site, align the end of the plastic plunger against wall. Force against wall. Inadvisably hard push into wall. 

Give, injection. Slight burn, nothing major. Gratefully withdraw an intact point. Toss aside.

1, 2, 3, 4.

Rush. Flood. Eyes roll back. Heroin draws a warm blanket around life and tucks you in. No toes hanging out for monsters under the bed to grab. Heroin: the problem eraser.

Relief.

I went off the deep end with fent patches along with oxy 80's. i was actually wearing 1-2 100 mcg patches at a time and taking oxy op 80's. shit got bad and i had to get a grip or i was going to lose my marriage. two years later i am doing great and in a suboxone program. my mother continued to struggle and we finally convinced her to get in a program.(same doc actually). she never could get a grip on it. she did not go to enough therapy. suboxone isnt a magic fix all drug. you really do need to get in some kind of program that involves counseling. My mother would continue to take way more subs than needed and would run out early every month. i would bail her out for a while until 3 months ago when my doctor told me he had concerns about my mom. he really shouldnt have said anything to me about her but he did. he somehow knew i was enabling her and i told him i would put a stop to it. my mother never got a grip and i think she was kicked from the program. last week over half a box of my subs went missing. i know it was her but cant prove it. not many know im on it and those that do would have no interest in taking them from me. its such a fucked up mess. i dont know what to do. she is in real bad shape and my dad is in denial about her addiction. my last conversation was not good between my mother and I as you can imagine. she will do anything to cover her ass. i had to do a taper this month but im getting by.  has anyone ever been through something like this or have any suggestions as to what to do?

I have an rx for 120 count of 8/2mg subs per month for pain--daily headaches (yes, I actually do have them) they caught on to the fact that I am an addict (after plowing through the fentanyl patches, opana er, methadone, etc.) and switched me to subs. I live in the Midwest and and am only given a UA once, maybe twice a year. Have been on it for a couple years. Never had to do anything other than go in every month for the rx. They tried the buprenorphine patches for awhile but they didn't help for some reason. Subs have truly saved my life. The other meds were super strong a sometimes a great ""high"" but I'd be in the Er up to 4-5x per month with uncontrollable migraines and the daily headaches were horrible. Haven't been to a hospital for two years for a migraine since starting on subs. Would give up those other meds any day of the week to stay on subs. I sometimes need all 4 subs per day and sometimes don't need them at all. I've been off everything else (also an alcoholic and needle loving addict). Suboxone really is a great option for fucked up addicts like me who have daily pain. Only problem is my friend from rehab hound me for the damn things all the time.

He was in the military and has ptsd... which I think is a big factor in his drug problem. He's been addicted to heroin and cocaine in the past. Dilaudid is his drug of choice now though. He's an intravenous drug user. I'm not against drugs, I occasionally enjoy opiates and benzos. I mainly just smoke weed now and drink once or twice a week. I did go through a rough time with Xanax and k-pins. So I understand addiction. I know that I love opiates and benzos so I only do them once in awhile.. and I only take them orally or sniff them if possible. I have a needle phobia.. I freak out even just getting my blood taken at the doctors.  


Anyways, at first he was only doing it once or twice a month. Now it's at least twice a day, I'm sure more than that, I only know what he tells me. No matter what he says, I know he has to do it every few hours so he doesn't get sick.  He's done it in the car in a store parking lot with me right next to him. He'll do things like ask me to hold his rig or wipe blood off his arm. It pisses me off because I feel like he's almost rubbing it in my face. We got a hotel room last weekend and he told me was doing it in the morning before he left so he wouldn't get sick. He has asked me in the past if I wanted him to give me a shot and one time I said yes just to see what he would say. He was like ""fuck no, i'd never do that, and I'd kill anybody whoever gave you some."" So anyways, we're at the hotel, he was trying to find more dilaudid for hours and finally got some that night. He was like I have to draw my shot up for in the morning, I can't leave it laying out all night. I'm watching TV trying to ignore it and he sits right next to me drawing it up. I was pretty drunk, because I told him I wasn't going to be sober if he was getting more shit. Not the best decision on my part. 
He asks me if I want a shot. I wanted to see if he would actually do it so I didn't say anything and I just stretched my arm out. He immediately gets up like ""okay. I'll have to do your left arm because your veins are better."" So he wraps a cellphone charger around my arm, and tells me to tap my arm a few times. I do it, and he gets in front of me with the rig, inches away from my arm. I'd be lying if I said I didn't consider it for a split second. Anyways, I got pissed and said that I'd never do it, and I can't believe he was actually going to do it to me. He says he won't let me addicted, and he'd rather do it then some random guy that might rape me?? Then he gets pissed because supposedly he had to take the shot that night and he wouldn't have any in the morning. So he does it and we proceed to fight. We almost left the hotel in the middle of the night because we were fighting so bad. I eventually start crying, I was hysterical, I know the alcohol didn't help. We both calmed down and the rest of the night was okay. He's bipolar on that shit. one minute he's saying ""I love you so much, you're my everything"" the next minute he's cussing me out and calling me names. Cunt, fucking bitch, etc. 

I really do love this man. I'm the only person that knows he's back on opiates, besides the people he uses with, of course. Everyone has told me to run, get away from him... even a friend of mine that's a recovering heroin addict. I can't abandon him though, I would never forgive myself. I want to help him but I know I can't. All I can do is love him and care about him, which is what I think he needs the most. During arguments we've had I've told him I didn't know how to handle this, what to do, etc. He always says ""what are you going to do? Break up with me when I need you the most? Not even try to help me and just give up on me?"" It breaks my heart, I hate seeing him like this. He told me spent $400 on drugs last week, I keep telling myself he's exaggerating but it's very possible he did. I'm not sure why I'm writing this. I think I'm hoping for someone who can relate, also an active addict's point of view, advice, etc. 

I'm lost. I feel like I'm enabling him by staying with him, basically saying ""hey, I'm not okay with this but I'll deal with it."" If I leave him, I'll feel extremely guilty like I'm abandoning him to fight this battle alone. I have no idea what to do. Sorry for writing a novel.",1441842376.0

Currently, I'm smoking about 1 to 1.5 grams of tar a day.

I need to stop that and get on subs again.

However, it seems like each time I get back on subs, the transition is rougher and more painful than the last.

I currently have at my disposal:

* 8mg/2mg sub strips
* DXM
* Kratom
* Loperamide
* Remeron (mirtazapine)

The biggest issue I have with the transition is: I get super strong nausea / vomiting along with extreme anorexia. I usually am puking and unable to eat for about 3 days.

Usually I'll take about 2mg about 12 hours after my last hit (this doesn't cause precipitated withdrawals for me). Then, I'll take another 2mg about 3 hours later if I think it will help. I'll continue that process until I reach what I think is a reasonable dose, then take that amount every 12 hours. The first 24 hours is bearable, but the following 72 hours after that is hell.

Any suggestions? I've heard some people say that smoking a little tar about 3 hours after you take subs will help even you out and make it more bearable (apparently the subs will diminish the effect, but not completely block it).",1441826182.0

In need of some info and figured this was the right community to turn too. I recently was given a grey 100 mg morphine pill. As I said it's grey says 100 on one side and n on the other. I'm in Canada as well. The reason I'm giving all this info up front is basically I'm trying to figure out if these are tamper proof. I would like to be able to iv it, but properly. And if it is tamper proof is there a way to by pass that with prep. I have been reading online and got a variety of answers. Clearly I want to take the coating off first. But other than that I had gotten many different answers. Some say crush it and let it sit in cold water for five min then suck up through a micron filter. However if it does gel I don't see how that would not just turn into a fiasco. Other says cook the whole pill in water then crush quick and pull it up. Others say bring a certain amount of salt water to a simmer dump in the crushed up pill another quick heat up then pull up quickly. So obviously some conflicting information. So if anyone has any personal experience with these and figured out a way to work it out I would greatly appreciate the insight. I would also like to point out I know this is dangerous and I'm doing at my own risk. But I am going to do it one way or another so again just trying to do figure out the safest most efficient way possible. Thanks guy.

I kicked a three year long IV dope habit back in January, only to trade it for an even more sinister loperamide habit. I’ve been on lope since January, and am finally kicking lope after a few failed cold-turkey attempts (148mg/day habit), but I’m kicking with insufflating dope as a substitute. I know, it’s moronic. But I had the opportunity to get clean(ish) and took it. My girlfriend is monitoring my use of smack, so that I won’t get strung out again. I am ready to be clean from all of the drugs. I’m tired of this lifestyle.

I’ve officially been off of lope for one week as of today. I’ve missed a dose of smack two nights ago, and woke up in absolute misery. The absolute worst w/d symptoms I’ve ever experienced. I could go into details, but I’m sure you get the picture all too well.

My question is, when I start tapering with the dope, am I going to be in double trouble? I plan on using for another week at last, just to be sure I’m out of the worst symptoms of lope withdrawals, but after the other night, I’m horrified that I may have gotten myself in over my head.

This isn't my first trip to rehab this year, but this is most definitely the last. I'm out of options, and out of places to go. This is my last shot for real. The people whom I've hurt, still somehow care about me. I don't deserve it, but they've stuck with me, albeit from a distance now. I've lost everything I care about, and I'm ready to fight to get it back. 

Most recently I was kicked out of my mother's, this is after I was kicked out of my long term girlfriend and I's apartment. While I was in a previous program, everything I owned was sold and I came back to nothing. So naturally I went back to my old fucked up ways of using. That went on for too long. This life has gone on for too long. I'm finally ready to get my life back.

It's never too late to go back. It's never too late to start again. I know I've felt hopeless and after weeks of calling and calling every rehab that took my insurance, I caught a break. I got into a long term, 90 day, program and I'm checking in tomorrow morning. 

This life is exhausting. It will take everything from you. I didn't believe that and then proceeded to watch it happen. All while using and trying to numb what was happening. I'm tired guys. I want to live again. I want to change my story. 

For those of you with smaller habits and low tolerances, keep them there and try not to let it progress. It will if you stick with it. If any of you are on the fence about quitting / getting help, just try it. Dope will still be there if you decide to go back. Relapse doesn't mean it's over. It's just the restart button. 

If anybody wants to talk about possibly getting help, I'll be on the tinychat for the night.

Hope all of you find happiness, whether it's with drugs or without. 

I don't remember where I heard this quote, but I like it:
'Heroin takes the best parts of you, and locks it away where you think you can only get them when you're high.'

That rang so true for me. I'm scared I can't be a good person without using. I feel like a better person when I'm high. Motivated, full of energy, and an overall uplifted disposition. It's there, I just have to find how to get it without dope.

Anyway that's my little rant. Stay safe everyone.

My first opiate ever was IV heroin, injected when I was peaking on five hits of acid.

I guess most people start with a little hydro or codeine.  Go big or go home I say!

It was actually an interesting time in my life, when I was selling acid, and I had never had or even wanted to try any opiates.  Anyway, I was tripping balls and an old buddy of mine came over to pick up.  He didn't have any cash, but said he had some smack and would shoot up me and my girl if I could throw him some LSD.  He is a registered nurse, by the way.

Naturally I agreed.  He was a friend from a long time back and I would have just given him a few hits if he wanted it.  So he preps the shots while I studiously didn't look at the needle.  He puts a tourniquet on me and got the vein on the first try... thank JJ!  It was so intense.  I couldn't stand up, and I didn't want to. It was exactly everything I always thought it should be.  Every molecule of my body was in ecstasy.  He shot up my girl, took a few tabs and left.

I'm not one for trip sex much, since I can't focus on what I'm doing and get easily sidetracked, but this night, we fucked like crazy.  It was easily one of the best experiences of my life.  

They always say that your first is the best and you can't ever match it again.  Well, that is a dragon that I know better than to chase.

Because this is such a low doseage my sub dr said he is cool with giving me suboxone even though I am on these drugs. My sub dr isn't allowed to write the scripts himself as he is a pain dr and it's not his feild to touch adhd and anxiety issues.

I really don't want to lose these scripts. The xanax I need and I'm afraid my general dr will learn I abused opiates and I think I will abuse benzos. The reason I picked up dope was because of my anxiety. Without xanax I would have given up on the subs and relapsed by now. I have tried abusing benzos when I was younger and think it's dumb.

Maybe about a year but I have never posted. I'm on here pretty much every day and Everyone on here is so great and easy to relate to so I figured I would try and get a little more involved.
I started on pills about two years ago and moved to sniffing dope around ten months ago. Got a little carried away and I'm now 25 days off dope and just maintaining with pills. This is my longest dope free stretch!
Anyway, I live alone and I have an African grey parrot who is about five years old. I got her at three months. Basically, a bird with that intelligence level is not one that sits in a cage all day. If I am home, she is out and with me. An awesome companion and she even sleeps in a chair right next to my bed every night. I'm curious to hear if any of you guys have pet birds. When I'm doing dope, I'm constantly washing my hands after like every line because I'm paranoid that a little residue is on there,and if I go to scratch her head or pet her, she might get a little on her. Birds are notorious for weak and sensitive respiratory systems and I would be devastated if anything happened to her. Anyone else feel this way too with their birds or pets as far as transferring a bit of powder to them when interacting?
Thanks guys, and I'm lookin forward to being more active on here! 😎",1441917257.0

In a day I might go through 15-25 mg of oxy, 1/4-1/2 pound of PST, or 5-10 mg of Opana, depending on which of the above I'm using at the time. I have a few techniques for managing my tolerance and was curious if anyone else has other suggestions. Here are mine:

1. Exercise. Everyone knows that this helps with withdrawals but I find it to be really valuable for managing cravings while using. If I go on a long run or bike ride I tend to use about half what I would otherwise. Probably has something to do with the endorphins that are released.

2. Cycling opiates. There's definitely a cross-tolerance between different opiates but it does help to switch it up. Currently I'm on a cycle with kratom, oxy, opana, PST, and tianeptine.

3. Using other drugs, especially weed and adderall. Weed makes me feel dumb so I try to keep it to a minimum but it does help with cravings. Adderall is fun.

Any other suggestions? I'm trying to look at opiate use as a game, whose goal is to keep tolerance as low as possible while still reaping the benefits (I use mainly to improve my motivation and work ethic). I should mention that I don't like to nod, and this would be a LOT harder if I did. ",1441903708.0

I have legitimate pain (wisdom teeth taken out) but I also tend to abuse drugs (weed/shrooms). I've never had pain killers before except Tylenol and Advil... But I was sent home with a prescription for T3's... Got home bottle said to take 2 but I took 4.

I really liked the feeling so come 5 hrs later I take 4 again and went to bed. I didn't get the same feeling that I got with the first dose. 

At this point I think my pain would be manageable with extra strength Tylenol, but I go ask my dentist for a stronger pain killer by telling him that the pills have not been effective. He gives me 5mg percocet... I get home and do the same thing... Pop a double dose and wait for the slightly euphoric effects to kick in... Lovin' it... Pop another double dose about 6 hrs later... Feel about the samesame...  But the 3rd and 4th doses didn't do much for me... 

At this point (day 5) my tooth socket got infected and was causing quite a bit of pain and I don't have anything to treat it with... So I go to the dentist again, he sees the infection agrees that it must be painful... And at my surprise he gives me a prescription for 5mg morphine sulphate... 

I get the prescription filled and go home and take 2 as the bottle said... Wait an hour and take 2 more because I don't feel any pain relief... These pills are doing nothing for me...

My questions are:
How do I get the pain to stop? 
How can I get a euphoric high consistently with small doses of percocet or morphine? (I don't want to go into higher doses because I know I'll get addicted.)
And is there like a waiting period between doses like take desired amt 2 nights in a row then wait 4 nights... Repeat...?

I've been around here for a little while but wanted to use a throwaway for this question. I'm not really sure yet what I'm even really looking for here, but any advice or personal experience would be great:

So SWMBE (someone who might be me) likes to think he's a smart person, but recent life stress has driven him to make a fucking stupid decision. Despite the unshakable results of every study related to this crazy AF crap, some ""10mg"" capsules were acquired.

After testing extremely small doses, bumps were bumped up to 10-15mgs of whatever this stuff is. For the record, the capsules supposedly have 10mg TOTAL AF as far as I know, yet 10mg of the actual shit is about 1/10th of one capsule. 

Anyway, 15mg produced weird results. Some initial return to wellness was felt, though it didn't feel much like an opioid. Some buzz was felt, but it also seemed to cause as much pain as it relieved, along with speed-like stimulation (wtf?).

Anyway, it's anyone's guess without a chem test, but it did seem possible that this was in fact AF (heavily cut with god knows what-- would love speculations on that as well). There were definitely some effects at such small doses (15mg of this...mixture); mainly a weak, short-lasting, opioid-like buzz. Yet I thought it would be much much stronger. This makes me wonder whether I underestimated habit/tolerance size and just need more to get the full effect, OR it really is as strong as usually reported and can cause respiratory/CNS problems without even producing much of a buzz.

So, I guess I'm interested in a couple things. First, I would love to hear some very strong personal experiences or reports that can genuinely convince me what to do with this shit after getting to know it a bit. Second, I'd love to know what you guys think this stuff might be based on how I described it.

I know how insanely steep the downward spiral is with this new-age fire on fire shit, assuming that's what it actually is, yet I obviously find it very difficult to just dump it.

So... what do you guys think?

Also, I apologize if this sounds extremely vague or just retarded-- I am in fact feeling some effects as most of you have probably surmised if you've bothered to read this far. But if you have, thanks, and I'd love to hear your thoughts! Tell me this douche who got this stuff is retarded and that he should dump it. Or maybe you have strong reason to believe this can in fact be used responsibly. I am terrified of doses any higher despite the apparent cut of the AF, but definitely feel like the ceiling is actually a lot higher. Oops... I'm rambling agin. Okay, that's it.

EDIT: I was just thinking that, being conservative, if there is really only 10mg total AF per capsule, then that means these 15mg doses are actually only ~1.5mg AF, which makes a lot more sense considering my lower tolerance, since conservative (on the safe side) approximations would equate that to about 50-60mg of something like oxy. Is this also stupid? Or could this be the answer? And if so, again, what is this?",1442029231.0

ok im not going to use my normal account as I know ow stupid this was. I just need help thiking about what to do. I have crohns, have had half a dozen bowel ressections, am on legit pain meds through pain managment. Im also on humira injections which, they arent working anymore and they kill my immune system.I just got a port installed about a month ago due to some up comming surgeries. I have had a few infections in my mouth that now medically requires two teeth be extracted. I guess because of constant dry mouth and infections some of my teeth are fucked, its embarrasing, and depressing.

To get those surgeries done the dentists reffered my to a oncologist that took medicare, an after looking at my copious records agreed with putting a port in. So i have had the poirt installed for about a month, havent messed with it. About 12 days ago I started getting high temps, shaking etc...It wasnt injection related as I was out of pain meds and had been for over a week. I Was in the hospital for 6 days and given antibiotics.

So tonight ( I have been really really depressed, teeth, medical situation, lost my girlfriend night before my birthday,) I was going on almost 72 hours without sleep. I dont take sleeping meds as they are harder to get off of than pain meds. I haven taken benedryl before to help me sleep and have gotten it a few times throughout my life at the hospitals. I have read stories about H being mixed with diphenhydromine etc...so I took a few capsules and mixed it up in a huge syringe and injected it through my port. I started to feel it, than nada....now my port is stuck.'

I know im an idiot...im sure it was too thick for the port line and just clogged it up. I know how bad this is, i can die if a harden chunk comes out etc. I dont think that will happen but am still scared. I have never been in trouble for abusing meds ever...Im currently in a state I have lived in for a little over 2 years. I have had many many many hospitalizations for my crohns. I do however always go to my favorite hospital with my favorite gastro doctor that is outside of the county I live in. If I goto a closer hospital, which knows my history as I went there when I first moved here (didnt like the gastro doctors)...If I goto my normal out of county hospital im screwed. So when I goto the closer one what should I tell them?  that I Was flushing it and it just stopped? or do I tell them my sob story and that I was stupid and hadnt slept in 3 days and made the bad decision of messing with benedryl and my port? act stupid and tell them I have recieved benedryl via iv all through out my life and just wanted some fucking sleep? If I can get them to just take it out without telling any of my other doctors that would be great. IF this story does get to them im afraid i will loose all pain managemnt and pain meds when admitted to the hospital etc...to top it off when I had a 104 temp the other days (im on antibiotics, but cultureswere clean) my motuh was chattering so bad I chipped my front top two teeth in HALF...so its just been a bad few weeks, and I need help with what to do

Please any response besides your gonna die, and youre an idiot would be great. I have never abused a port before. I do once and this happens :( I normally inject hydromorphone, and have actually stayed away from using my port all month cause i knew it would jjust make shit worse....vgeafy",1442026761.0

does anyone else sometimes forget that opiates can induce violent projectile vomiting of many fluids and particles? I did. I don't normally get any nausea from opis. I can do dope several times a day, high doses of fent, even iv opana has never really made me nauseous. and no, I'm not trying to brag.

for the past few days, i've been using *a lot* of iv dilaudid, since I have terribly easy access to vials of it, for only $4/vial. I also have 5ml & 10ml lue lok syringes. My tolerance has also been relatively low. I started off with 1mg shots, and that was ok, then moved to 2mg, which was great, and stopped at 4ish. doing 8 was literally breathtaking. the rush from dilaudid is **godly**, the warmth that moves up your spine can literally be uncomfortable at high doses when your tolly is kinda low. But today I had an idea, to shoot 16mg, when 4 is great. I just wanted to see how it would go.

Beforehand, I had probably eaten like 5 of those little jello-pudding cups. the vanilla ones go hard lol.

so I grabbed my 10ml syringe and twisted the 22g 1in needle on. stuck the needle through the tops of 8 vials, and proceded to hit the back of my arm, I register, then push down. Also, it fucking sucks pulling back to register on these huge ass syringes, it also blows when you have to pull out and go back in, but that rarely happens.

The fucking rush was crazy! I loved it! Mixed with oxymorphone this would be wonderful. But shortly after I then puke my guts everywhere. I didn't even feel nauseous at first, this is how fast it hit me!

So I'm sitting here typing this fresh off/on a bit of a bender...so yesterday, I took a 30mg Adderall in the early afternoon and then...and yes, I know, this wasn't necessary, probably not recommended either, but I did it...I acquired and snorted some methamphetamine later that night. This is not something I often do, nor do I want to do too much...I just enjoy a nice amphetamine high on the weekends here and there.

Anyhow...my question. So my drug of choice is oxycodone, typically in the form of the 15mg or 30mg roxies. Yesterday, I was also able to get my hands on 7 of the 15s. They're still all in my possession as I sit here writing this at 8:43 AM, not having gone to bed in the slightest yet...which I expected. I've had these nights a few times before in the past so I knew that was going to happen. I enjoy the amphetamine ""rush"" but I'm not a huge fan of the fact that it always keeps me up all night. With that all being said, am I okay/is it a good idea to pop those roxies around lunch time? It will have been almost a full 24 hours since I took the adderall and between 12-16 hours since my last tiny bump of crystal. I'm thinking it will help me with the comedown? I've done this once before, 12+ hours after taking an adderall, I did 105mg of oxycodone and I felt absolutely wonderful. I'm just looking for any personal experience from anyone who has taken opiates after pulling an all-nighter on amphetamines and not having slept. Good/bad? Should I wait till tomorrow when it's all out of my system? Also, something to keep in mind is that I have not had any opiates in nearly 5 days, so I'm jonesing but I'm TRYING to not let that affect my decision, although I'm sure it inevitably will. Regardless, I would still like to hear from anyone who has any experience with this...thank you all, fellow users, abusers, and anyone else who frequents this sub!

I get really bad edema from heavy opiate use. It has happened to me on heroin, but fentanyl really gives it to me bad. It takes about 2 weeks of using for it to start and a week for it to disappear, basically when withdrawals subside the edema is gone. It gets so bad i can't even get my shoes on. I press a spot with my finger and make a dent a half inch deep. Massive water retention, only in the feet ankles though. My kidneys and liver check out 100%, i'm healthy. Diuretics do nothing, even high doses. I found no cure on the internet. I tried experimenting with many things. 

I thought i would share my cure since there is no cure on the internet. Even people on prescription patches have this problem and it leaves the doctors stumped. The cure is potassium chloride sold as ""no salt"". I fill 00 gel caps and take one every day, completely cures it in a matter of 2 or 3 days.

I feel like Monday is going to be the last day I live.","Hi. I wanted to talk about this for a moment. I'm a norco addict. I've gone through all the usual stuff. I've stopped and relapsed a few times before. I've sought help, gone through treatments, and found myself back in the same place. This Tuesday, once again, I run out. But I truly and honestly do not have any means to get more. I need to save money. I'm not single and I have others who depend on me. We need to save money so badly, and this habit has already taken so much.

Yet life is just so bleak without my once a day ""fix"". 

Its only 50mg daily. But see, it used to be only 10mg, then it was only 15mg, and so on and so forth until it became only 50mg maybe a week ago. I don't think my liver can handle much more before I have to start doing CWEs.

I just feel like I'm a different person when I know I have a supply and as long as I can look forward to dosing every day. I'm happier, obviously. I can take on anything. I can handle my problems and the problems of others. When I don't have them, I just feel dead inside. No motivation to do anything. Everything reminds me of them.

But that in itself is a problem, isn't it? These little pills have so much control over me. I count what pills I have, figure out what day I'll run out, and view that date as though I know it to be the day that I die. As the days get closer, I count them down like ""x more days left...""

I have 2 days left and then I'm going to crash hard, and I'm going to have to pretend like everything is fine to the outside world, because no one knows. And no, I can't just ration them out or save them for other days. Thats part of my problem. As long as I know I have them, I can't not take them.

I'm tired, and one side of me hopes this will be the last time I'm going to have to do this. The other half of me doesn't want this to be the last time though, because I can't fathom the concept that I won't have them again.

7 days later, he's out of the hospital but back at it. I run into his room to get something and there's smoke everywhere. Parents aren't around so I'm the only one to notice the foil laying around. I debated for a long time whether to tell them and they finally elicited the info out of since they could tell something was wrong. I felt bad for ""busting"" him, but I think it was necessary. I mean he was in ICU and now he's using the exact same way that literally brought him to the verge of death. Also, everyone in the family is concerned and nobody wants to disown him. We just miss the smart and funny version of him, now he's starting to look unhealthy and when he's sober, he's cynical and avoidant.

Ok, i woke up yesterday morning feeling sick so i prepped up one of my cottons for a cottonshot, did it and went back to bed, woke up 2 hours later feeling sick again so i went and prepped the rest of my cottons for a shot, i went to go hit a vein in my foot(that i have hit MANY times before, registered, and when i was squirting it in, the whole bottom of my foot felt this like tingling burning sensation, i thought it was cause i was tied off still, so loosened the tie, the feeling went away for the most part, registered again and was in and finished shooting the shot and before i could even get the needle out that like electric burn feeling came back so fucking strong, it was almost unbearable. all i could do is lay on my back with my foot over my head trying to rub it. my whole foot got bright ass red instantly, a hive began to form over the injection site, and my toes started to swell up so big that i couldnt wiggle them at all and it hurt too much to walk. All i could do is lay there with my foot elevated for a few hours rubbing it with my hands to get the burning sensation to go away. Now i thought i might have hit an artery at first, cause the ''electric burn'', the swelling, the bright red injection spot, all are tell-tale symptoms, but it couldnt have been that because ive hit in the same vein multiple times before with no problem, when i registered it was the dark red thick blood, not the brighr red blood, and while i had to deal with what was happening, i was no longer in withdrawal so i know i didnt miss the shot.

Like im not exxagerating when i say it FUCKIN BURNT, i have never in my 7 years of addiction felt anything or experienced anything like that before. I was so scared my foot was literally dying and i would have to get it amputated because of the intesity of the pain and the swelling that i was thinking of calling 911 but decided to try and ride it out first,

Now...I called my Mom. We talked for an hour. 

Usually when I would call she would answer and there would be this long sigh. Like 'What now?' This time, there wasn't any of that. She was happy to hear my voice. One of the first things she said was 'I didn't know if you were alive. I love you and think about you all the time.'
We went over the happenings of the last 18 months. My ups and downs, hers too. I told her that today I am sober. That I wanted to talk to her with a clear head. I held it together until the last 15 minutes, then I started to cry. I told her that I just want her to be proud of me. She got emotional too...and told me that she has always been proud of me, even when I was messing up, that she always loved me and wanted me to just be okay. That she knows how smart I've always been, that I just used my brain the wrong way. She asked if I would come see her. And we made tentative plans for Christmas. I haven't seen her in 14 years. I just want so badly to hug her. To have her tell me that it will be alright. I feel like that small child I used to be, that ran to her to be scooped up and loved on. I'm 35, and I just want my mom back. One step at a time. Maybe this sober thing might not be too bad, especially if it will bring me closer to the important people that I pushed to the wayside in my selfish pursuits. 

Thank you all for your loving support. I love that any of us can come here and pour out our hearts, and be surrounded by people who understand completely. I don't have that in real life. You are an awesome bunch. If there are any of you reading this who can relate...call that person you've been putting off contacting, they do love you and are wondering if you are okay. It will make you feel 1000% better.

UPDATE!
Before posting this I did search foreverrrr and found mixed answers but I wanted to see you opinions! What I did in the end that took alot of work and time approx an hour to an hour and a half. I filed the coating off.. some weird latex shit. after that I cut it into tiny tiny pieces using my pill cutter and fingers to tear them as the pill cutter didn't cut through them all the way since the blade doesn't touch ground.. it wasn't made for rubber plastic shit pills lol. If I had a good razor blade I highly recommend that over this.

Once it was into a ton of tiny pieces I took it to the stove eye and sat it there on med/high heat until it turned brown and it began to melt. I put 1 and a half syringes of water into the spoon mashed the shit out of it with the end of my syringe and mixed like hell. At first I had a nice thin water that I pulled up into the syringe. Shot it. Ahhh so good. Put more water in for the remainder but this time I ended up with a thick water that took 5 minutes to draw up into my syringe.

Since this was so thick I decided it was best after it hit the 50 mark to fill the rest of the syringe with water and shake the SOB. Worked like a charm.

I feel AMAZING. My first time doing opana unfortunately I got a shit brand. I would never recommend anyone shoot these long term but if you're in a bind like I was and had no other option.. fuck it. I am now out of a week long withdrawal my body is pain free and I feel a pretty decent high. I could take 200mg of oxy IV'd so if I had a yellow 40 I'd be orgasmic right now. I'd like to thank you all for the advice thank you so very much! Happy nods everyone. May the luck of junkie Jesus be with you.

Then today I was curious about heroin - I thought, marijuana gets a lot of shit but only because society is full of prejudiced morons. Heroin, well, it gets ten times more shit than marijuana, and I actually believed that shit. Until now. I started reading online. First Wikipedia, then forums, and articles. It seems as though the biggest risk is accidental overdose. And it also seems like multiple uses won't even necessarily get you addicted. So one time?

From what I've read, a one time use of material your friend knows isn't super potent like 80% pure is pretty much harmless - both short term and long term wise.

Should I do it?

Thank you Reddit in for giving me a place to ask people who actually have experience with the drug. I was pretty close to trying it and I have a pretty abusive personality when it comes to vices.

I started my career a couple years ago getting op 80'a for $35-40. That was great. Then I lost my connect and struggled to find any kind of anything for less than $1/mg. About 6-8 months ago I found a connect for H. I now have a couple of people I can go through, but I always have to pay $140 for a half gram. Sometimes it's fire, sometimes but not very often it can be shit. Either way, is it just me or is that shit really expensive? From what I've read here and other places I should be getting like twice what I am for the price I pay. If I'm wrong tell me and I'll feel better, but if I'm right I just wanted to vent a little bit because this fucking habit is hard to maintain at this price.

Been taking opiates for about 4 years. Used to just be some percs and norcos but in college started smoking the good 80s before the coating. 

Messed with that kind of stuff here and there and when I moved found a hook and started just doing about 4 30mg oxy blues a weekend. I never really thought it was ruining anything, like I knew the risks but money was fine and short of a mood drop the side effects weren't terrible.

My blue guy went away and I stayed off for a while until I got on the darknet and saw how much cheaper black tar was... So then I started doing that for a few months to about where we are now (1g black tar a week), and only in the last 3-4 orders have I been getting gunpowder and various #4 grams instead. 

The two times I've actually stopped stopped from the heroins (with the #4 being less forgiving than the tar) been nightmares. RLS, sweating rivers, so so so much loneliness and sadness, some days can't even move. I didn't think I would get all that from weekly use of only a gram but here it was. 

I had to spend all week this week recovering and trying to get strength for my best friends wedding. During that time I thought a lot about how I don't want to do this forever and while I LOVED the feeling there was no future in it for me. Problem is I already had 10 stamp bags from NY on the way. 

So two days ago, literally before I'm headed out to the wedding I come home and unwrap my 10 bags. I knew just 1 would fix this awful week, make the wedding a lot more fun, but i would just keep doing it. I could have said this is for sure the last one and enjoyed it but how do I really know it would have been last?

So instead I unwrapped all 10 bags and threw them in the toilet, I cannot tell you much it sucked at first, wanting to do just 1 and watching fall into the water and flushed ($140 order).

BUt now I can honestly say I feel great. Like... I am still pretty down, things are magically sunshine and rainbows. But I suddenly have a lot more confidence in myself and just feel stronger knowing I had the ability to have it in front of me and throw it out. It proved to myself I can do that.

I know this isn't much to people here, and I definitely wasn't a huge addict but it was super hard for me and getting it out helps so thank you for anyone who reads this.",1442200185.0

A Cast of Chemical Characters
There are different kinds of people in this world. Just as there is diversity in the world around us, so it logically follows there would be diversity in the addict habitat. Here are a few:

Captain save a bro:
This type of user refuses to admit he is addicted, yet constantly wants to sample some of your bag. He will arrive on the scene with money swearing up and down that he is not going to use. He has a job, a place to live and will occasionally let you stay there. Yet, the captain can only use at your place therefore you are happy to see him as he always has money.

Chronic illness Jill:
Jill does not have cancer, lupus, or any other diagnosable condition. No, Jill is ALWAYS sick yet will not have sex with you or anyone for drugs. Her general good looks enticing yet she only wants to cuddle after she has ingested copious amounts of YOUR drugs. If she ever has her own drugs, she certainly is not sharing with you. Between her over priced connect and constant whining, you would put her out if she was not so damn cute.

Scandalous Steve: You can not trust this motherfucker with a god damn thing yet he always has access to THE BEST drugs. Plus, he save you that one time from that overdose. Steve is a ride or die kind of junkie when he is holding but those fingers get sticky as he gets sicker.

Scripted Shelia- She is that older chic with the pain pills. She will give you a ride if you kick her down when her monthly runs out. And it always does.

Stepper Sam- Sam went to twelve step meetings once a few relapses back and likes to talk about recovery while you are high. He can quote all the literature and like to say things like ""easy does it"" while you are fixing your drugs.

Always Overdose Oscar- Get your narcan ready- Oscar is coming over. He likes to do WAAAY too much. When he wakes up under a table, he denies that he ever fell out. You have strongly considered taking the locks of the bathroom just in case.

Prison Paul- Prison Paul likes to get high and tell stories about the joint. He is an expert in both dropping a bottle for your PO and creating delicious entrees from ramen and cheetos. He never carries his own syringes for legal reasons.

Finally, there is your get high and hope to die dope fiend. Everyone enjoys talking shit about this person yet wants some of their drugs. Some work, some do not yet using is their full time job. They can explain how to extract the opiate as well as extracting the last dollar out of your pocket. They think in grams, stamps, books, bindles, and bundles. They are part doctor, nurse, chemist, criminal, counselor, and attorney.

I think I have a natural immunity to opiates. I've tried everything from percs and vics to Dilaudids and Oxys, even tried opium once. Aside from getting a little tired, I pretty much felt no effects from these. Some of them were very large doses as well. Xanax works just fine on me, I drink and smoke weed regularly. 

For what its worth, both of my parents used to do drugs, but I don't think either of them were heavy into opiates. 

I've done a bit of research and I haven't found a lot of information out there. Does anyone else have this problem? Or know anyone? All of my friends think I don't know what I'm talking about, or I'm joking, until I pop ten percs or a blue and nothing happens lol.

Interesting bit, I had a bottle of 2mg dilaudid not too long ago, and I went through about 30 of them in 5 days. I seemed to notice a very small amount of euphoria (could have just been placebo) and I caught myself BARELY nodding off a time or two. For someone with little to no opiate tolerance, an 8mg dose of D should have fucked me up right?

20, male here. I'm suffering from depressions and an anxiety disorder for a while now (+3 years). Thoose mental issues were caused by mobbing (related to rheumatism) and violence in and out of my family.

I'm on 90mg duloextin and 1.5g medical cannabis daily for 2 years  after being in a therapy. I've learned to handle the depressive thoughts but I still often feel lack from motivation (usually caused by anxiety).


After introducing myself to 20mg of oxycodone I've experienced somewhat unexpected effects after coming down. Well, I nodded off and felt like I was reborn when waking up the next morning. I feel rested (obviously), relaxed and my motivation was great aswell.

Thoose after effects stay with me for a good day before slowly fainting away.


I'm now doing 20mg oxy 2-3 a month as a relief. Not only for the plain high a user is normally looking for. Can anyone relate?

The horse god was watching me.  Moths circled us before dissolving into Light.  Reflections across the black pool, trails of starlight shimmering over still water.  A flat, monotone girl voice asking, ""Lover, you awake?""

My eyes open.  

I look at the clock.  A mere forty minutes until my alarm goes off for work.  And I crave sleep...But I'm laying in a puddle of cold sweat and have to piss so bad it's agony to move.  I know if I get up I won't return to dreams.  But the withdrawal will awake.  Right now it's still passed out in a puddle of my alcoholism.  Getting up will make me puke.  This is my morning ritual, so I don't rush.  I want to let the demons slumber...but a gallon of piss and forty fucking minutes ticking down like doom plague me.  I can already feel the runny nose and nausea stirring.  Throbbing pain from the top of my skull, spreads out to my teeth which I grind at night.  The demons use curved, spiked ice picks on my spine to pull my nerves apart like frayed guitar strings.  Fuck.  I already want my morning taper pills.  My habit is shoving me into a new day.  

No rest for the fucked.  

The wife sleeps like normal people sleep.  Seven to eight hours and not in a puddle of oily, stinking pill sweat.  Her sleep is so deep.  She does normal things at our age like she has a career, volunteers for Girl's Scouts and helps the kids with homework.  And me?  I fret away hours and die between pill taper doses.  A useless thing.  But she knows what I am.  She doles out my pills on a plan.  Sometimes I catch her studying my arms and hands.  I swear I won't do that but you know the word of a junkie...  

I go to work with a kiddie sandwich bag filled with just enough pills to survive my eight hours.  Sure I could take them all at once and feel GREAT for an hour or two.  But then I have the next five or six hours to sweat, throb and die at my desk.  I always think of cheating but she knows me well enough to keep her own pill count.  I love her and think of touching her face but I don't want to wake her.  She is on kid duty and gets them dressed, fed and off to school before work.  Also she is slammed at her job and working extra hours.  Poor thing is exhausted.  

Life gets crazy after breeding.  She just dyed her hair again.  Sparkling blond streaks mix with a redwood brown.  Her new look is alluring and I keep meaning to tell her but our life is jam packed with duty and time slips away.  To fuck her, I need to plan ahead and schedule my intentions the night before.  Alas, I did not do this.  I am not a good planner during bouts of dopesickness.  Now she is turned away from me and I don't blame her.  I scream a lot when I sleep. 

The dream I had is still on me like a sweaty, plastic sheet zipped halfway over my body.  My face is exposed but the surreal texture of the dream is like the embrace of a bodybag.  Moments like this fill me dread.  I fear I'll get stuck on the wrong side of the dream but I heard you calling me Priestess.  

Thanks.  

I breathe following my wife's yoga training.  I breathe slowly and deeply like she taught me.  Sure I was staring at her chest but I did remember the important parts.  Inhale Ra, exhale Ma.  From my belly to the top of my lungs I breathe.  And I remember the other side.  The dream.  I pick up my phone and start typing.  I want to get down the feeling now.  I'll type it up at work and put it on Reddit later.

""Dude, you're dead"" I say looking at his worn face.

""When?""

""Like the 90's.  Right when I started college.  The guy at the record store told me.  Maybe it was just to sell me your used tape for $8 which was expensive but fuck. You died.  I bought it.""

""OD?""

""Thats what they said.  OD in New Orleans.  But later I read some guys dosed you.  When you started frying they ripped off your methadone stash and then kicked the shit out of you.  Your body was found curled up in a ball beneath the coffee table.""

""Jesus"" sighs the man leaning back.  ""Fucking brilliant.""  

He fumbles for a cigarette.

""You can't smoke in here"" I tell him softly.

He leans forward and laughs as he runs his hand through his dyed black hair and stares at me through his fingers.  He's a little fucker.  Most musicians are.  His New York Queen's accent is mesmerizing.  Like a shadow, his native city follows him all around the world and into the next life.

""So I can bring a fucking dog, iguana or a fucking miniature service horse into any of these fucking stores and smoke weed all goddamn day but I can't smoke inside a bar anymore?  It's fucking cold outside man.""

""Yeah.  Weird huh?""

The waitress comes over and looks at us with poorly concealed contempt.  She flashes her server professional smile that lasts less than a second before dropping back to a bulldog scowl.  She looks like she's in her 40's like me, tired like me and just wants to go home like me.

""Last call gents.  Anything else?"" she sighs.

""Long Island.  Extra long please"" I answer.

""And you?"" asks the lady turning to the man.

""Ginger ale.  No fucking ice.""

She walks off on her slip-proof, orthopedic shoes.  The girl serving us earlier wore heels but she's gone.  Now just sensible foot wear for older people forced to labor on their feet all day.

""Did anyone care?""

I look at him and wish we could smoke in here.  And I don't even smoke anymore.

""Yeah.  I mean you were kinda obscure but people cared.""

I have no idea if this is true.  Before the age of digital information, I read a paragraph about his death in Spin magazine while taking a shit in the dorms.  It didn't say much at all.

""Ob-scure?"" he repeats obviously annoyed.  This is a man famous for his violent outbursts in life.  But he sighs and sags into his chair looking around the dying mall.

I look towards the restaurant to see if the drinks are coming.  Maybe I'll order another one if possible.

""That crazy girl you did junk with.  You know the one that liked burning shit and throwing bottles?  She likes me.  In your bookshelf, in the corner where the spiders shits dead bugs all over everything is The Great Gatsby.  Good book by the way.  In that fucking book is a photograph of her wearing MY fucking t-shirt!  Me!""

""How do you know that?"" I ask.

""It's a memory.  As long as people give a shit, I'm here.  Through films, records and tapes and CDs and...what the fuck is a mp3?""

""It's music.  Like uh, a computer program.""

""Can you hold it?""

""No man.""

He smiles, puts his hands behind his head and leans back.  He stares at the mall ceiling where a football field-sized bank of lights starts to shut off one giant rectangle at a time.   

""It's harder to feel.  But thats the way of the fucking world"" he says as a shadow overtakes our table.

I think about last night.  As usual, I was the last one up.  Trying to drink myself to sleep.  With enough alcohol, the few pills I take can glow.  But the euphoria is dull.  Like I should choose.  Get drunk and crushed in nauseating sadness or keep walking down the junkie road?  A road littered with broken hearts and old bones.  I straddle both worlds these days.  I wonder if alcoholism is a better fate?  Socially, it's more acceptable but fuck, like any junkie will tell you, it ain't as good.

When I get drunk, my melancholy thoughts take me to a place where time is meaningless.  The young people are always beautiful and arrogantly vain.  And why not?  They will live forever and have all the time in the world.  Music transports me across reality to these lost moments.  Music is magical.  A spell and a key to lost worlds.  So I was looking online for old music.  Sure I could buy the music but he's dead.  So who cares?  

So I look elsewhere and find what I'm looking for.  I find that forgotten tape I bought oh so long ago. Played so many times it unwound and puked itself to death in a car stereo.  This music presided over MAYHEM.  It was the theme music for moments so fucking euphoric it is a wonder I am here writing this.  I start to download it and realized this will take awhile.  His music is not popular.  It is shared by few.  Only six people spread this tape that so many of us loved.  I look at his other selections.  Even less peers give a shit.  In all, fewer than ten people care enough to keep his music breathing online.  

I pass out waiting and never hear any of the old songs.

""Fuck!  It's so cold here"" he complains rubbing his hands.  ""Maybe see if I can get a coffee instead?""

I look at him shaking in his chair.  Because of the dimming lights he seems to be smearing into the shadows.  Blending into the Darkness.

""Sure.  Let me see what I can do.""

I get up and wander over to the restaurant but it's dark.  No one inside.  I wander around the corner and all the shops are dark and empty.  With no windows in the mall, the darkness is unnatural and a solid presence that makes me fear the Night.  I feel for a wall switch and turn on a row of lights that stretches far off into the desolate mall.  Emptiness.  

I look back at my table and he's gone.

So I walk forward.  It is all I can do.  But everyone is gone.  And then...I see it.  Scraping itself across the floor towards a deserted hallway.

Some broken, creeping thing.  A horse skull on top of of a long body.  Four long, thin arms grasp a metal walker as it shuffles slowly forward on four, useless feet.  Moonlight pale skin pulled over skeletally thin feet drag behind the creature like a great sadness.  It knows I am here.  Powerless, I walk towards the thing and start gasping.  My heart wobbles in my chest as I hyperventilate.
  
I awake.  Another day is upon me.

RIP Johnny Thunders

I hope everyone had a good or at least decent weekend. Everyone staying safe I hope. You guys are such a wonderful community. I really enjoy reading all the stories and I feel a real connection when I do. :)

Well, I digress..................

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I am **THIS** close to getting my cash money right. I have been waiting for 2 fucking weeks for a check to clear (would rather not get into details for personal reasons, but whatever) and I'm hoping that this shit will go through on Wednesday but I've been told it can take up to another 10 fucking business days....AHHHHH!

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I've also been starting to sell stuff on eBay.  It's going okay.  Due to a recently odd but nicely timed purchase I've come into ownership of a commercial cooler/fridge thing, like the ones that hold sodas and shit at the grocery store.  I paid like nothing for it and found out it's worth a pretty penny online! Plus it works amazingly and is in really good/clean condition. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

So, I put the damn thing on eBay, Facebook, and Craigslist.  No dice on Facebook or Craigslist, but I had a lady message me after just 2 days saying she lived close and wanted to come look at it.  Now, we've been talking/texting for about 4 days now and she says she wants to pay cash and really, really wants it.  BUT every time I try to schedule a meeting with her, she is at her office, or it was her father's birthday, or she was out of town on a business meeting for the day.  It doesn't feel like a scam(unless she gives me fake bills - which then I would be fucked) I just think she's dragging me along, which is also BS.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

So, this weekend on Friday afternoon someone ended up buying the fridge on eBay.  Now, I'm not sure how familiar y'all are with eBay but you can press the ""BUY IT NOW"" button and it will ""end"" the listing, but you won't actually receive payment immediately. After 4 days you can open up a Unpaid Item Case (which I've done) but probably won't do anything since the customer doesn't have to pay if she doesn't feel like it. Anyways.....I was super excited at first! Because, hell yeah I sold the dang thing and am gonna make some fucking BANK! But now my listing is taken offline because another woman who is like 9 hours away said she wants to buy it. 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I send her a fucking invoice,  I message her 3x, call once leave voicemail, call again today and get a woman on the line.  She says she needs to ""talk to her boys"" whatever that means.  I mention the fact that she's far from me and that she would need to come down here to get it.  I mean, it said ON THE LISTING that it was local pick up only...I mean really it would only take a day to come down and get the damn thing if she really wanted it...but I digress.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

So, I message the FIRST lady saying that someone has purchased it on eBay but they haven't paid so, if she wants it today she can have it because she technically had first dibs, and I want to be nice, plus she's local and prefers cash. She said she wouldn't be back until Monday... I just chalked it up as a lost sale...oh well.  So, she messages me this morning saying that she still wants it, or at least wants to come look at it. Yay! Maybe...So...Here's the convo played out:

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

**HER**: Hello! Did you sell the fridge or did they pass?

&nbsp;

**ME**: They did not end up buying the fridge - it is still available. If you'd like to buy it today I will knock the price down to $--- just for being so patient. (I figure if I sweeten the pot she'll bite and I can get this sale closed faster plus I also figure that I can just cancel the transaction with the other lady on eBay if the first lady ends up buying)

&nbsp;

**HER**: Okay, I'll be down to look at it today. I am at the office/work until at least 5pm. When are you available this evening?

&nbsp;

**ME**: That's fine. How about anytime after 5:30-6pm? My address is ... cash is fine or paypal.

&nbsp;

**HER**: Cash is easier. (yay!) Do you have the dimensions again? I'm just now leaving the office (it's about 6:45pm at this point)

&nbsp;

**ME**: *sends dimensions and other boring information*

&nbsp;

**HER**: Well, I rode with someone else to work today and I'm stuck here until they are ready to leave. Pretty much I need to be able to fit a ton of quarter gallons of milk in the fella which is why I wanted to see it.  It sounds like it's large enough but I can't be sure until I see it you know?

&nbsp;

**ME**: Of course, I understand. That's not a problem at all. Well, I have no plans for the evening so, it you'd like to still come by today/tonight that is fine by me.

&nbsp;

**2ND TEXT ME**: Also, if it helps I can send more pictures in the mean time if you'd like.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I never heard back. I'm hoping she'll text tomorrow and I mean, Shit! I'm willing to drive the damn thing up to her. She's only about 30 min away.  I will say that I have noticed she take like a long time to answer texts, and I've only talked to her on the phone 1 time, the first time we spoke. (She messaged asking me to call her), But yeah it'll be like a couple hours sometimes before she responds. I just really need (and want of course) the cash plus, I just want this transaction to be done with! Is she fucking with me?   Am I retarded and not seeing this is a blatant scam? What is going on? Advice is always welcome.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

I am **RIGHT ON THE VERGE** of everything.  On the verge of being broke, on the verge of WD, on the verge of being hungry, on the verge of getting a check, on the verge of making big bucks, on the verge of **LOOSING MY FUCKING MIND!**

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Plus, my bf has a small bag that we picked up today but he caught me pinching earlier (bc I'm a piece of shit, human being) and he was really mad.  Like not mad-mad, but like disappointed-mad, which is SO much worse. He's in bed and I'm sure if I went to look in our usual spot it would be missing because he hid the bag. Oh well, my own fault. He had a feeling a was pinching and he counted the little fucking rocks in the baggie. Yeesh. Anyways, my guy would give me a front - or sometimes he'll just help me out for free but it's late and I don't really feeling like taking a 40 min ride (or longer) to the city.  Usually takes 1.5-3 hours total depending on traffic to get my shit. Such a time waster. Ugh..

I just need ONE LINE. JUST ONE, BABE PLEASE. HOLY GUACAMOLE!

So I've been chipping IV H for about 4 months now, once a week max (but might dose 2x in that day sometimes) is what I decided was acceptable.  I changed out of pure curiosity from snorting H or oxymorphone about the same frequency, if not a bit more.


I've honestly found it to be less mentally addicting than snorting.  With snorting I'm high all day and could redose whenever I wanted to.  It made me more of a ""junkie,"" if you will.  Subconsciously (and consciously) I was very aware that I could just go to sleep high, wake up the next day and snort all day and be high for the rest of my life if I really desired.  Obviously it doesn't actually work that way.


When I IV it lasts about 2-4 hours and is less plateau-y depending on the quality, so I don't have that concept in the back of my head that I could just be high forever if I wanted to, as well as knowing that my veins wouldn't be able to withstand that.


Before switching to IV I had been chipping at that frequency for about 3 years, so it's not like I just started and jumped straight on the needle.  And it's not like I'm immune to addiction, I definitely have to consciously restrain myself quite a bit.",1442277442.0

He said it was a $10 shot but i feel like he just gave me a cotton rinse.

I was wondering if there are any Iv chippers that could help me figure out a dosage that isn't too underwhelming/overwhelming. I want to feel that rush, there was a slight rush the other day but I wish it would have been twice as strong.

What's a good dose for me? I quit a 2 yr heroin habit (snorting) about 2 years ago but still notice I have a slight tolerance.

I was thinking 40-50mg of deepnetmarket quality h should be a safe and fun amount to try.",1442267917.0

The only time It bothers me or I notice I smell bad is after going like 24 hrs with out a shot and I always shower right away when I notice it. 

Opiates make me hate showering for some reason.  Wtf. Because I can not go more than 1 day without a shower when I'm clean.  I have read about this phenomenon in a couple junky books. I think Burroughs and Goines talks about it, one compared junkys to cats I believe. 

Am I the only one??

Ps I still use deodorant daily and brush my teeth in the morning so it's nt all bad. And no one has ever commented negatively. ",1442256516.0

I was like 19 and my parents wanted to drug test me after they made me come home from college (somehow they found out I was selling weed/adderall, don't really know how they found out to this day). So they wanted to drug test me and I went and bough ""quick fix"" name brand they many have mentioned on here. I warmed it up and went to take the drug test. Temp was at ~99 degrees when I put it in the cup so literally perfect. 3 days later they call my parents and say ""we have the results and the sample was not of human origin"" meaning they knew it was fake piss. I have heard a ton of other people speak highly of quick fix but it did not work for me whatsoever. The test was in oregon btw so I just wanted everyone to know about that and just be careful. I'm sure 9/10 times it will work but again, didn't work for me.",1442251893.0

My habit isn't insane but I would definitely have horrible w/d if I stopped using cold turkey. I was thinking about bringing poppy seeds but I feel like a pound of poppy seeds in my carry on (although legal) would look sketchy as fuck. If I it questioned by TSA even for like a second and my dad realized I had brought them, it would ruin the entire trip. Seeing as how etizolam is unscheduled in the state that I am leaving from and heading toward, I will be bringing that along with. If I just consumed a fuck-ton of immodium, some etizolam, and maybe a low dose of DXM (if I can't cold cop some weed), do you think id be able to avoid withdrawal altogether? I've read something somewhere that immodium can take care of like 90% of w/d symptoms, but not 2 days in a row. I'm gonna consume poppy seed tea Friday morning so I'll def be good for that whole day, I just need to make sure I can avoid withdrawal Saturday and Sunday. What do y'all think I should do",1442248115.0
