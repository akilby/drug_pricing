I'm talking about suboxone 2mg with naloxone .05 mg.  
I know you can inject one without the naloxone doing anything but  can you inject 4 2mg pills without the naloxone having any effect? Also people seem to say its pointless to inject more than a 2mg pill, is that true?
Also I've been on 6mg  suboxone for over a year, i miss getting high so I want to switch to methadone. Has anyone successfully switched to methadone from suboxone? how many days did you wait for the methadone to begin working after switching and what dose did you start the methadone at?

First of all, I have a tourniquet. It's got a plastic lock which you can undo pretty easily, as long as you use your thumb, which means I have to let go of the syringe and risk the needle slipping out. So far I've used the tourniquet to let the veins come out, and as soon as I can feel one, I loosen the tourniquet and go in right where I've made out the vein's location, register, and push off. Will this work with all veins though? Or do some veins just disappear once the blood flow goes back to normal?

My other question was about the angle you're supposed to enter the vein at. Should you go in as shallowly as possible? Because I've read somewhere you should aim for 45 degrees. I mean it both makes sense...

If I could kill the man who got me into heroin, I would. He's a disgusting piece of shit from New York who actually got me to spend my money to go meet his dumb ass. He promised me  life full of love and happiness and left me with an even worse addiction than I showed up there with.   


Heroin is not what I expected. I still get excited when I pick my drugs up. Still. Even though I know. I FUCKING know nothing will happen aside from I won't get sick. Even though I KNOW the chance of myself catching a nod is a distant far away dream that I can no longer reach. I still get fucking excited to pick up, despite the fact I haven't had the desired experience from heroin in probably over a fucking year now? Maybe it only feels like a year but I do know it's been months at the least and that's long fucking enough.   


How do I pretend shit's worth it when I can't even get high.   


I know most people here are like me.... good hearted people who find themselves doing things they thought they never would to fund a habit. That's so many of us. The majority, I'd be willing to bet. People say the worst about us... ""They'll steal your wallet and help you look."" Do you know how fucked up it is to realize you ARE now that person? Do you? It's so fucking disheartening. I fucking hate myself. Every day ""Amanada you're a piece of shit"", it's the first thought when I see my face staring back in the mirror. ""Amanada you should have died so many times but you're here."" I dated a man who was a few years my junior, 22 to my 24. This was a couple years ago. He was the best man I ever met. Kind, sweet, loving. He was on opiates for stomach cancer and he warned me so many times not to let the pull of opiates rip me away fully. But upon his death, I let the pull rip me apart. Everything else was ripping me apart so I figured why the FUCK not, right?? What have I to lose when the best man in my life is dead?? WHAT HAVE I FUCKING GOT???   


Well, I had a fucking future to lose. I did not see it, but I did have it.... it's right fucking here now, NOW I am here and I am LIVING IT. I am living my shit future all because I let my life go to shit. All because I wanted to self medicate. Well, fuck. This is my fault. Not his or her or yours, MINE.

I just saw the doc Overtaken on YouTube. There are two people--kids, really--who OD'd, went into a coma, and woke up with permanent brain damage. The one who took opiates (Oxy's, I think) is now a quadriplegic.   


Yet, it seems to be much, much more common for people to just pass away in their sleep.   


I wonder if the brain damage has to do with ROA? Or something else?

This happened a few months ago. At the time, I was going to my local methadone clinic, although I wasn‚Äôt on methadone, since there was a month‚Äôs long waiting list. So instead, I was put on suboxone and told I would make the switch to methadone whenever my name was next on the list. I eventually stopped going and went back to the dope game (and I‚Äôve been using ever since, unfortunately).

Anyhow, while at the clinic for my suboxone, I would have to show up once a week to talk to my counselor, take a drug test, and pick up my weekly script of 7-8mg suboxone strips. I guess you would eventually get bumped up to monthly scripts if your drug screens were turning up good, but yeah, I think I legit passed one test throughout my few months there (Mainly just weed and heroin, as I was still dabbling with it, considering the subs did fuck-all for any mental cravings).

So each week, if you failed your drug test, as I did like clockwork every week, my counselor would show me the drug test results from the lab and I could see exactly what substances I was failing for. I mean, I already knew each time what I was going to pop for every week, but the one week, I was definitely thrown for a loop...

Now, as I mentioned, while my habit had considerably decreased once I got on subs, I was still using like 2-3x per week...it was kinda dumb to be honest, because even though I would intentionally wait 48+ hours since my last sub dose, I could still tell the little dope I was using was getting blocked and way more for my liking.

On those 2-3 days per week that I did use, I was going to the same connect each and every time. And her bags were ALWAYS consistent, always the same shit (a dope-fent mix, of course). We would know when she went to re-up and even then, it was always the same.

So this one particular week, I get my drug test back after being told I once again popped for heroin...not surprising one bit. But what was surprising were the additional substances that I was also pissing hot for...now, as mentioned, I was getting my dope from the same one spot every time so I knew it had to be from those bags. I also was 159% positive that I was not putting anything else into my body that would explain the other shit I tested positive for...

As expected, I had shown positive results for morphine (which is what heroin breaks down to in your body after use), as well as two different analogies of fentanyl (not exactly sure which two, but it‚Äôs irrelevant). Here was the huge head scratcher...I also tested hot for codeine and tramadol.

This made, and still doesn‚Äôt, zero sense to me. When heroin breaks down in your body, it doesn‚Äôt end up breaking down/producing codeine as any type of byproduct, correct? And tramadol?! I haven‚Äôt fucked with that shit opiate since like 2013. They‚Äôre whack and even if I was dopesick, I think I‚Äôd still turn my head to those if ever offered any. 

I know this post was way too long and detailed for most of you, especially since I don‚Äôt really have any point in making such a post, as it‚Äôs all in the past now.

But it still does make me scratch my head. As stated, I know with 109% certainty that I never took any codeine or tramadol pills. It seems as though the only logical explanation would then be that my connect used these two pills as her cutting agents? This doesn‚Äôt really make too much sense either, though!  While I suppose it would logically make sense to cut dope with another opiate, who actually does that? No one. There are so many powders out there that people use to cut their shit much more easily. I just don‚Äôt get who would go through the time in crushing codeine and/or tramadol pills to use for a cut. It‚Äôs just not feasible, especially when you‚Äôre selling like 15-20 buns per day, as our lady was.

Getting any type of answer or response to this isn‚Äôt really of much importance to me, if I‚Äôm being honest haha. It happened awhile ago. Like I said, a comment on another post had reminded me of this happening and I guess I just was looking for any type of insight from any of you beautiful people.

In conclusion, sorry for the absolute unnecessary wall of text I just spewed. Blame the meth, guys, not me!",1537952116.0

Mac was/is/will always be my favorite artist, and his passing hurt me more than either of my 2 year Gf breakups. Ive been onto him since before his first studio album (Song title ""Don't mind if i do(better than ""Donald Trump"" I'd say)"", 6 months before his first album). My biggest regret was that I never got to see him live, I always figured that hes young, I'll see him soon. Apparently it was an OD, but the fact that his house was scrubbed clean is leaving authorities with many questions. It'll take another couple weeks before news breaks on his autopsy about what really happened. I needed to vent because hearing this enraged me.

The lobby at the hotel is cold.

My clothes are wet again. There are 600 bucks in my pocket. That‚Äôll get me a week and then some at this sleaze bucket motel. Besides that, though, there‚Äôs another 75 bags in my other, and the shot I did in Cowboy‚Äôs car on the way here is hitting me hard. I fade out. I wake up and fade out again. My eyes open once more. There‚Äôs a fat man at the window, renting his room for the night, and I grab one of the brochures on the rack showing the local tourist attractions. This one is about a haunted tour of some buildings in the city, and I put it up to my face like I‚Äôm reading, an inch away from my eyeballs, to hide the fact that I‚Äôm very obviously high and nodding out in the lobby.

The fat man gets his receipt and walks out the door. I stand up and come to the window.

‚ÄúHow much for a week?‚Äù

‚Äú439 dollar.‚Äù The English is not easy to understand.

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I pull five of the bills in my pocket out and slide them under the window. I notice a sign that says customers need to check their rooms before paying because refunds and room changes are not possible. It‚Äôs a testament to how terrible the motel really is. I point to the sign and tell the man, ‚ÄúHey, what about the sign that says you should probably get your typhoid and tetanus shots before you stay here?‚Äù And laugh.

He doesn‚Äôt understand but makes a face I know well. It‚Äôs the face people make when I‚Äôm high and they are disgusted by the things I‚Äôm saying or just the way I‚Äôm saying them and how I look. I‚Äôve seen it lots. The thing is, though, that when you‚Äôre so high that people are angry about it, it‚Äôs basically impossible to not act that way.

‚ÄúHere. Change.‚Äù He slides back a 50 and a ten-dollar bill with a few coins. ‚ÄúKey. Control.‚Äù He slides me the control and key under the window, too.

I nod to him and walk out. The rain is still falling. One of the lights off the side of the office illuminates the drops which look like angry insects divebombing the parking lot pavement. The key they gave me has one of those old school plastic pieces with the room number on it, 127. It is poorly cut and requires a bit of struggle to finally turn, but once I get inside, the room is warm and filthy. The maid probably cleaned it or whatever, but there are holes in the drywall and crayon marks everywhere and the mattress is so lumpy that you can actually see how misshapen it is right through the comforter all covered in fuzz and lint balls. Along the wall a strip of red carpet sits poorly contrasted with and even more poorly seamed together with the blue that covers the rest of the room, except by the bathroom. There's another square patch against the wall there, too. But worse than the way anything looks is the smell. There‚Äôs a mini fridge. It‚Äôs old and dented and the paint has chipped off in places, maybe a replacement for the last one that got left unplugged for a long time with meat in it. The smell of rotten flesh of pigs or chickens has soaked into the carpet and fabric, permanently. Nothing will ever completely get rid of the smell. 

I throw my bag against the nightstand, plug my phone in and strip off my jacket and shirt. The last shot I did was so good that I nod out for a minute standing up by the bed. It‚Äôs like the feeling is warm gold running through my veins. I think that‚Äôs clich√© or something someone said about it before me, but the image in my mind is of some early 90s video game character when they get like 100 gold coins or rings or whatever they‚Äôre picking up all over the place knocked out of them, but it‚Äôs the opposite. Instead of losing the gold, it‚Äôs me and I‚Äôm absorbing this swarm of gold doubloons from out of the air. That‚Äôs what I see, when I‚Äôm nodded out. It feels so good. Then, I wake up and want to watch something.

I get on the bed and grab the remote, but it doesn‚Äôt turn the TV on easily enough for me to keep messing with it, so I throw it on the floor and see a bible on the other nightstand. It looks to have globs of dried, hot glue on the cover but cloudier. I touch it for a moment, before it occurs to me that it might be dried semen. Jacking off on bibles is not something I‚Äôve done much of. So, it wasn‚Äôt my first thought. It‚Äôs pretty irritating, though. Why such disrespect? Why waste your time? I don‚Äôt even wash my hands. I just nod out for the night.",1537948187.0

so me and this girl were waiting on the dope boy down the street from a trap house and the dboy is making us wait forever, constantly telling us hes 10 minutes away (red flag 1) standard dealer bullshit. while we were waiting this dude from the trap house waves us down so we walk up to him and he asks us what we want, i tell him were waiting on someone and he asks who so i told him idk the name (the dboy had given me a fake name so i didnt really bother throwing his name around) but i can show him the number and maybe hell know who that is, he said nah to that and the girl asks him if he has dope, he asks some of his associates if there is any dope and informs us that its not available but coke is, he also mentioned that he knew who we meant and that the dboy didnt have any dope(red flag 2). so we go back down the street and wait on the bench for the dboy. after a little waiting a guy comes up and asks if im waiting for his brother so i just kind of stare blankly at him when he mentions my dealers alias (red flag 3) , so i say yeah. he asks me what i want and i tell him a bundle for 45 and he says ok and to follow him into the park so we follow him and he says he wants to see the money(red flag 4) so i hand him the money. and he says something weird about his brother dying that i didnt really catch and then he says we got 5 seconds to leave. i fought him and got money back and if anyone is interested in the details let me know. i learned a couple of valuable lessons from this experience, i should listen to my gut because i thought it was sketchy to begin with that the dboy was making us wait so long, that just because someone says they know your dboy doesnt meant you should trust them,and never give the money upfront without at least seeing the product. the thing is i already know most of these rules but ive grown complacent because i havent dealt with any bullshit in a while. honestly the whole thing has made not want to dope anytime soon really,fighting could have gone so wrong and dope just isnt worth it.

&#x200B;

The only connect I had was a friend of mine, and his connect was a middle. That guy only wanted to deal with my friend, so getting this dude's number for myself was not an option. So I was basically going through (at least) two levels of middle-men, and not only did I have to rely on my friend's work schedule but HE also had to work around his connect's work schedule. All of us work in restaurants so we all work crazy hours. So the working out the timing to score was a huge bitch, and would frequently have to wait a couple days. This made it very hard to prevent going completely dry a couple times.  


This inconvenience was not the only problem. This stuff was expensive, and he would often short us (most likely taking some off the top for himself, my friend tells me he was a pretty big user himself). So not only would I over-pay, I would get less than I was supposed to. Once or twice it was a LOT less.   


THEN ON TOP OF THAT, the quality was incredibly inconsistent. Many times it was great, but there were a lot of times it definitely wasn't. It was definitely cut to hell sometimes, and though I'm very stupid and didn't use a test kit there were times that the high was a good bit shorter than usual which was a red flag. The color also varied pretty much every time I would score, ranging from beige to an unsettling white. Basically it was a different experience every time and very much a roll of the dice.  


NOW things are different. I got myself a good plug, not a middle. CONSISTENCY is this guy's game. The longest I've had to wait for a text back has probably been ten minutes, and I believe that every time I have called him he has answered. I have to drive to him, but it's never more than a 15 minute drive... and he pretty much always is ready for me to come by when I call. Seriously, the longest wait has been once or twice when he told me to wait about 15 minutes before I headed over.

It's not just consistency in terms of when we can meet up. The quality is always the same. It's always the same color (I love my brown sugar baby), and the high is never short and shitty. It is definitely more pure, and it is always among the better and more potent stuff I've had. The price is much better, as well. Like almost 40% less.   


The downside is my intake has definitely gone up. Hard to help that when it's cheaper, better, and always there. For now I'm just thankful that the process itself is no longer sketchy or a huge pain in the ass. 

One love. Stay safe. Happy nods.

I did this shot at 9:30pm. I fell asleep sometime in the middle of the night or early morning and woke up noon feeling worn out but it was over.
Cotton fever? Or something else? I triple-filtered because I didn't want extra fillers in there, but I was just using those tiny cotton balls that Chicago needle exchanges give you. which is another thing.

And then went away. She left for work and it came back even stronger, she just got home and is sitting down rocking back and forth in tears. The pain is in her upper stomach below her breast. She describes it as someone twisting her organs up tight and then letting them go. It will slowly subside, and slowly increase. Like in waves almost. She says she is having regular bowel movements.

Feel like this is basically just an easy way to get high and I'm not complaining. All the power to the people that can follow the program and are getting better through this medication and the clinics though.,1537838917.0

He gives me a number of his favorite plugs and I give that a try, and the dude seems legit and we work out a place to meet..I drive there and call and he says that he is pulling up..2 hours go by and finally he comes through.  I jump in his car and he's driving, with girlfriend in passenger seat and one of his friends in the back with me.  Everything goes alright and I give him my money and he gives me some dope, well it's about half as much as it should be and I start saying this is going to work.  Well we go back and forth for a minute, and I never raise my voice or say anything disrespectful at all, just that what I got was no where near $100 worth.

Then out of nowhere, the guy sitting in the passenger seat just hauls off and sucker punches me right in the face about 4 times and fucking cracks my damn nose.  So I'm gushing blood and trying to get out of the car.  The driver though is yelling at the guy who punched me, freaking out on him for doing that to me.  I get out of the car and start walking away, but the dboy is apologizing and saying he didn't want dude to do that and that I should get back in the car.  His girlfriend hands me some paper towels for my nose, while the dboy is yelling at his friend for punching me..Then the dboy tells me to take this extra and actually hooks it up pretty good.

So I get back home and have to clean up all the blood, which I'm covered in and my car.  Pissed off about the situation I call the dude and bitch him out.  So I guess I did get a little more dope then I paid for but that came with a possible broken nose and swollen face, which I happily would have not received.

I just hate how these young dboys can treat people that are just trying to give them money for what they are selling.  He totally shorted me and I wasn't out of line in the least asking for him to make it right.  The guys friend was just a little punk and totally hauled off on me when I wasn't paying him any attention.  I wasn't being loud or disrespectful but they feel like we customers are all pieces of shit they can treat like trash.  Funnier still the whole time the dboy was bragging about how much money he makes and how all he dope he has means so little to him, well if that's the case why short me so bad if your such a baller?  I know I'm just venting but in like 8 years of being in the dope game as a buyer and seller, I never had something like this happen to me or done to someone I was serving.  Idk why they can't just treat it like the business it is and be professional?

Especially when the people probably haven't even done both...


Hey, guess what?

 Fent doesn't mean shit heroin newbs. If you really got fent, more than likely, actually most definitely, even more clarification, if your product is fent, it'll make you drool, face plant, throw up, and that's only after you wake up after hours of nodding without interruption or intent of ending up this way. Fent isn't shit, it isn't lacking euphoria to the point the high is not enjoyable. 



Fent is hated because it kills users unaware or reckless of its strength.


Stop saying you keep getting "" shitty fent/h mix"" and you wish your plug had just heroin.  Because-


 REALITY TIME BUD: regular, solo heroin. That which you want. That wonderful, great heroin. The antithesis of fecal fent. That heroin....is a PROBLEM!

 That heroin you want will leave you ALWAYS SAYING IT WAS A WEAK, BULL SHIT, RIP OFF BATCH.
WHY? because. It doesn't contain that ""SHITTY FENT"" you don't want. It's just heroin, and won't be anywhere near as strong. It might have longer legs, but it wont satisfy you.


You see, fent is exponentially stronger than heroin. That's why calling it "" SHIT FENT"" is ridiculous.  Any one with a fent habit struggles to just get well using top quality heroin.  


So all you newbs who keep whining you can't ever find fire clean heroin,  you never will. I guarantee you already had great heroin, but you dismissed it because you're use to fent.

I can shoot one bag of fent and miss, and it's compared to shooting 4 bags of this top quality heroin, and actually hitting a vein.

So fent isn't shitty. Heroin isn't some utopian, wonder substance. They're simply both opiates with different potency, effects, and highs.  ",1537830082.0

A week later, the test comes back, and he said he found no (listed a bunch of chemical numbers) meaning there were no opiates in the urine. Now how can that be? I know 100% it wasn't a plecibo because i was legit nodding and couldnt stop, the same way I felt from H... the same rush and everything when doing real H (I knew the shit I use to get was legit because I failed a drug test for opiates) and my pupils were pin drops. It looked like a very white tan. Like the lightest tan u can get without going into off-white territory. Also, it is pretty powdery. Like if i pour the bag too fast or the wrong way, you can see a poof of what almost looks like smoke. Very powdery but still has those classic ‚Äúflat chunks‚Äù h always has, just very tiny. Could it have just been fentanyl or some other synthetic research chemical?  Will the subs even help me if thats the case? Could it have been a false negative, or maybe my body processed it super quick, or maybe my pee wasnt warm enough/there wasnt enough?? I do legit feel sick when not taking this shit but I stay ‚Äúunsick‚Äù for unusually long lenths of time, like 1-2 days after my last dose then it hits me like a rock and I get crazy heat flashes, sleep is impossible, restlessness, yadda yadda yadda the whole 9 yards.

My partner and I have been awake all night because we started getting sick around midnight and couldn't sleep. In the early afternoon we arranged a Western Union money transfer and went to our dealer feeling as if we were melting from the inside to the outside.

Rewind to this time last year and I was just exiting rehab. I stayed clean for about 2 hours - the time it took to get from the hospital to the dealer and back home. After that, we chipped for a few months before getting properly hooked - again.

Tomorrow we have an appointment at the substitution doctor. I'd like to say that I know this time we will stay clean but I don't know if that's true. Every time I try to stop I feel a tsunami of nihilism and overpowering emotions unfreezing from beneath the opiates - like a massive avalanche of feelings, memories, trauma. *fuck the world and everything in it I just need to look out for myself and anyway it's too late for any other mode of being* These are the sort of thoughts that run around in my rattling brain when I'm getting clean.

So I don't know what will really happen after tomorrow. We will get on a script and see. I'm a bit scared. I feel as if I have reconstituted my entire being around a drug that seemed like the solution to a problem I didn't know I had and ended up being the gateway to a kind of distorted existence....Ach, nevermind.

I like reading people's experiences here and commenting when I have something worthwhile to say. I also like looking at the drug porn, if I'm honest - especially when I have plenty of dope at home.

1. How much heroin gets you nodding on 0 tolerance?
2. How do I stop biting my tongue during nods?

Googled suboxone doctors in my area and I guess theres 2 in my city. Ive been an addict since 14 starting with benzos and then opiates by 16/17 and am 20 now. 

Tired of hurting, tired of hurting my mother mostly. I kind of accepted the fact i won't ever be truly happy in the shitty world we live in but having my mom constantly worry if I'm going to die isn't fun.

Do they let you still smoke pot or is that based on the doc because I have had my ned card since a minor due to me having Marfan Syndrome and I can't stop pot because it helps a lot of with my muscle spasms and arthritic pain. 

My goal is to be on subs for 3-5 months like 8-12mg a day for the forst month or 2 and then start tapering down to 2-4mg and by the last month .5-1mg and then back to kratom.

Kratom works great for me and if I can get on subs and not spend the 300-400 a week on pills and dope(this is only because I'm chipping, i used to spend upwards to 1000 a week or 120-200 a day) which will allow me to stock up on many kilos of kratom to hopefully last a few years as it seems it still might get banned in a few months.

I just reblocked my one dboy. I have another to block but I want to get high one last time and he restocks Tuesday.

I'm not deep enough again for any major w/ds, I'll get a runny and some restlessness but no stomach issues or crazy rls which I guess now is s better time then ever to fully stop but I've become a chronic relapser. 

Prior to a month ago I had 3 months no opiates besides one day where i got 10 15mg xr morphine and that was the longest stretch I had since early summer 2017. 

My support system is huge but zi never hit them up when I should and only hit them up after zi get high, I don't cope woth life well, It's bee. A few weeks since I went to my therapist but i take home like $750 a biweekly after taxes and between heart appts, therapy, pain management,  eye doctor visits and bills I neglect my mental health over my physical.

I just needed to get some shit off my chest, my mom had sent me a large text about an hour ago and i basically told her what she didn't want to hear but it was the truth and I didn't lie.

 I truly hate the world we live in, well more or less the corporations who run the world, the people who don't care for or believe or environment is in danger, living with two people who suck Trumps dick like he's here to save the middle class but are to blind to get any info about shit other than the tv or facebook memes.

I have a job that is alright but my dad won't let me speak my mind to the ignorant fucks I work with and I eventually bottle all this hate in and boil over and go on a dope binge.

I've totalled 3 cars in 6 months, 2 from being high, one where I could of severely hurt myself or the family I crashed into when I fell askeep at the wheel, was on probation and thankfully, even though I was at fault the cops couldn't seem to care less and I never got a ticket or court date.

95% of the bad things in my life stem from benzos or opiates and yet I just want to use and use and use some more. I used to be SO optimistic about the future and now I barely want to make it through the night.

Suicide was on my mind heavy yesterday and although I didn't attempt it I took 240mg oxy xr, 3 mg of kpins and drank a bottle or so of wine. If I took the oxys and kpins all st once i would of been toast but I staggered the doses to stay high all day but I knew I was still slightly playing with fire.

Although I knew you are supposed to remove the tourniquet after registering, I didn't do it after several times the vein moved or the needle slipped out and I had to redo the shot. So I would leave the tourniquet and have it so close to the vein that when I emptied the needle there was a noticeable bulge.

After inquiring about it, I realized how TERRIBLE this is for your veins and under no circumstance should you tie off close to the injection site and leave it on.

I wake up to someone urinating in the apartment above hers.

	
	
The stream is thick and heavy falling into the toilet water. There are one, two, three stop and go splashes like an ellipsis in my mind and then the chink of the lever. Water runs through the pipes in the ceiling overhead and down the far wall. My body doesn‚Äôt move, but my eyes take inventory of the apartment. Our spoons and syringes have been put away. By Beth I presume. She is stuck in the act of lighting a candle. A match in one hand. The box in the other, and the Autumn Apple candle sits unlit on the coffee table. Beth is hunched over it. She looks like a computer game character stuck in a glitch of unnatural and repetitive movement. She bounces, nodding out just to barely wake back up several times each second. It‚Äôs something I used to do. Shoot. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôll probably be doing a lot of here soon. 
	
I sit up. I lean forward on the couch. There‚Äôs still plenty of dope in me, but I am coming down. My body parts move in one slow and sleepy pull after another. My nose itches. It‚Äôs something like birth sitting there slimy and sweaty and confused on her couch, cold and wet, coming to grips with the depression of reality after spending those few hours in nirvana. It‚Äôs not that depressing, though. There are still 14 bags of heroin in my pocket, a place to stay for the night and a hook up on some pure. That‚Äôs my reality right, now. I rub my face and try to stand. 
	
Beth must sense me moving around and wakes up to spend another minute or so getting a match lit and all the way to the wick of the candle before it goes out. Evening‚Äôs blue light glows over the roofs across the street. A siren whines through traffic somewhere in the distance. Curtains hang like half closed eyelids in the square windows pouring out that warm golden light from inside of the buildings out into the darkness. They are portals into the lives of families and single folk home for dinner or watching the evening news. They show me something I want, like paintings on a giant museum wall portraying normal kinds of life I‚Äôll never know, reminding me of everything I‚Äôm not. There‚Äôs a gurgle in my gut asking me to eat.
 
So, I ask Beth,
	
‚ÄúYou got anything to eat or drink?‚Äù
	
She says, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs O.J. in the fridge,‚Äù and holds two fingers to her chin for a moment. Her eyes close slowly. They open. Beth strikes a match and finally gets the candle lit.  	
	
I pull the handle on the refrigerator door and look in. There‚Äôs a two-liter bottle of soda next to the orange juice and a few hotdogs wrapped in cellophane and a bottle of ranch dressing and a bottle of vinaigrette in the door with some milk. There‚Äôs an open half-dozen carton with three eggs left in it. In the back is a can of spam covered in tinfoil. I whisper into the cold white light, 
	
‚ÄúSpam Baby,‚Äù and grab the O.J.
	
An old wine glass is all I can find in the cabinet. It‚Äôs an awkward thing to drink out of, but it works. I see a couple of bananas and a bag of some dried-out berries and sesame seeds next to the microwave. When I open the bag and sniff, my head does one of those spasmatic and involuntary jerks. I hold it up and shout out to her in the living room.
	
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this crap? Hamster food?‚Äù I am not entirely convinced a hamster would eat it, but I already know it‚Äôs hers. Beth eats like that. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so thin.
	
‚ÄúNo. That‚Äôs mine.‚Äù 
	
‚ÄúYou eat this?‚Äù 
	
She laughs. ‚ÄúYeah. I do.‚Äù
	
‚ÄúWho else‚Äôs been staying here?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúThe spam in the back of the fridge?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúWhat? Oh you saw that?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúYeah. Don‚Äôt you know about Spam Babies?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúSpam Babies? What? Oh, no! My kid!‚Äù 
	
Beth grabs her hoodie lying on the floor and has it in her hand walking backwards out the door. Her keys are in her hand. She tells me she‚Äôll be right back. The apartment is quiet and dark. It has a nice energy. Candle flame flickers orange in the living room. The room is warm, and the couch is comfortable. 

16

Martin‚Äôs apartment door is painted white and has three black metal numbers on it.

	
	
Soft steps move towards the door. Martin is talking on the phone. He opens it and gestures for us to sit on the couch. I just called him from Beth‚Äôs this morning, after she let me cook up the rest of that can of Spam in her refrigerator. She made plans to drop the kid off at her sisters, again, and now, here we are. Martin is wearing a bathrobe. He paces while he talks.  
	
‚ÄúYeah! Mom! Those are my chickens and my rooster. I don‚Äôt care if Larry said he‚Äôs the one feeding them. They‚Äôre not his to give away. Mom! No. Listen‚Ä¶.. No way‚Ä¶.. That‚Äôs wrong and you know it‚Ä¶.Well, he never gave me a chance. Did he? Did he? That‚Äôs my rooster! And I don‚Äôt care!‚Äù He stamps his foot down on the clean beige carpet as he screams, like a child throwing a fit. Beth giggles. She looks at me and makes as if to ask, is this really happening? It is. 
	
Martin‚Äôs like that. I don‚Äôt know how to say it, except that in all the years that I‚Äôve known him, there‚Äôs been one constant. He makes me want to punch him in the face. Not all the time but often. It‚Äôs just the effect he has on people. He‚Äôll hurt you the way children hurt you with honest and unflinching observation. Martin will attack your character for no good reason. Say something he doesn‚Äôt like, and he‚Äôll tell you how that‚Äôs an expression of your extremely hideous nature as a human in his condescending tone. You‚Äôre disgusting. That seems to be his answer for anyone who disagrees with him or offends him.
 
Another thing about it is that Martin disperses these little bits of unwelcome info with conceited wags of the head, like some sophisticated version of a chick in the ghetto. His wrists are thin, too. Now, I have nothing against men with feminine affectations. That would be a waste of time, but subconsciously, I think that he and I share some of those attributes, and perhaps my fear is that I‚Äôm walking around as feminine and rude as he is and no one is telling me. The thought is horrifying and perhaps a source of pent up anger, but like I said, I‚Äôm not the only one. Plenty of people have had their issues with him. 


Back in the day, it was Peter Donaldson, Martin and me. We were always together. They were the first people I ever got high with, at least on things besides weed, like mushrooms and Percocet and LSD and ecstasy and even some bumps of cocaine once or twice. All the other kids called us the Trippy Trio on account of there were three of us and all the psychedelics we liked to take. 

Petey was a great guy. I miss him, now. Unfortunately, he dropped some acid one night with some other kids out on the countryside. This was after we got out of high school and kind of drifted apart from each other. They were out there drinking liquor and dosing and a car smashed Petey on the highway. The kids he was with saw it all. Legend has it that all that was left of him could be scraped off the asphalt and fit into a shoebox, like all that was left of him was a puddle of sludge with a few organs floating in it or something. Maybe, the better way to say it is that legend had it, because I‚Äôm not sure anyone talks about it enough to consider it a legend, anymore. His mother and father in their mourning have left off telling it. I‚Äôm sure. It‚Äôs been 13 years. Besides, the phrase ‚Äòfit into a shoebox‚Äô doesn‚Äôt strike me as the kind of language my dead friend‚Äôs parents would use in talking about the tragedy. He was their only son. They only have their daughter left, but that was the story for a long time. All that was left of Petey could be fit into a shoebox. 

I wanted to care. I really did, when I found out, but I‚Äôd just figured out how to inject myself, homeless in the city of San Francisco at 19 years old and was doing a lot of meth. My father had died the year or so before that. Big shots of crank had already hammered my mind into hamburger meat my first week down there, and I‚Äôd completely lost it. I was answering phone calls from strange men who wanted to pay me for some company or picking through piles of refuse on the sidewalk for clothes to wear, always looking like some prehistoric savage on my skateboard with stolen hood ornaments hanging from my waist and strange fur hats and goggles while I cut in and out of deadly traffic in the rain. It was as if I was living out the fantasy of some depraved comic book character my drug addled imagination had created. My mind kept slipping into these paranoid schizophrenic fogs. I was committing crimes. I was injecting drugs. Caring just wasn‚Äôt possible. 

It makes me sad now, when I think about it. Petey was genuinely the nicest guy I knew my age, and that‚Äôs not one of those skewed postmortem affirmations of his character people like to give. He really was. Everyone knew that. Petey definitely deserved more of a chance at life than me or Martin, but now, Martin and I are all that are left. 
He‚Äôs wrapping up the phone call now and sitting on the couch across from us. Beth and I sit in chairs. The view through the window behind him shows a crane and city buildings, the water behind that. It‚Äôs right downtown.

‚ÄúOkay, mom. I‚Äôll talk to you soon.‚Äù He hangs up and tosses the phone on the couch next to him. ‚ÄúWell, Randy. Good to see you. What‚Äôs it been?‚Äù I haven‚Äôt seen him since I got sober. 

‚ÄúTwo years. Just about. This is a really nice place, man. What are you doing these days?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got my law degree. Finally. I think I was wrapping that up, right? Last time we saw each other?‚Äù He ignores Beth like she isn‚Äôt there with us. I don‚Äôt remember what he was doing with his life the last time I saw him, other than buying large quantities of black tar from me at a high price, sleazing it up on the car lot as a salesman and putting me down when we got high together in his last apartment. It wasn‚Äôt near as nice as this one.  

‚ÄúYeah. Sure. I think that sounds right.‚Äù I smile.

‚ÄúBut, you know how it goes.‚Äù 

I have no idea how it goes for a person with a law degree, but I nod. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. My mom really wants me to get on with a firm around here. She has all kinds of friends who can get me on at some of the biggest in town, but I‚Äôm still selling cars. Money‚Äôs just way, way too good and way too easy, Randy. Way too easy for me.‚Äù Martin gives me a deviant smile. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is Beth.‚Äù I say. She reaches out to shake his hand over his glass coffee table. 

‚ÄúNice to meet you,‚Äù he says as he sits back down. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs up, Randy? What‚Äôs this all about?‚Äù

I throw one of the D.O.A. baggies onto the glass. He picks it up, studies it and looks at me. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does it look like?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking you. Looks like a small line of coke.‚Äù

‚ÄúHeroin.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs white.‚Äù

‚ÄúChina White.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNumber four.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, Randy, we‚Äôre not all lifelong junkies like you. Okay?‚Äù There are hints of that condescension I told you about, but it‚Äôs not that bad, not like it can be. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pure stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúPure?‚Äù His face is pointed down at the bag in his hand. His eyes look through slits up at me, like he‚Äôs skeptical. 

‚ÄúGet your rig out. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù I say.


17

Before Martin even gets up to get his shooting gear, he asks me how much I have.

I count in my head the 16 that Sal gave me yesterday. I subtract the two that Beth and I did last night. That‚Äôs 16 minus two, so 14. Then, two for me and one for Beth, right now. That‚Äôs 14 minus three. So, 11 bags I can part with.
	
‚ÄúGot 11 bags I can sell, right now.‚Äù I tell him. 
	
‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúI want 20 a piece for each.‚Äù The reason I say it like that is that I know that‚Äôs now how much they are. Something about myself won‚Äôt let me tell outright lies. I have to talk around things to get away with stuff. 
	
‚ÄúSo, 220? What about two bills, even?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúYou got it.‚Äù I let him think he‚Äôs getting a deal.  

I pull the sandwich bag out of my pocket and separate three of the little square D.O.A. baggies from the rubber banded bundle inside of it. Martin walks into his bedroom. Beth opens her eyes wide. She can‚Äôt believe it. When Martin comes back, he‚Äôs holding an ornately carved mahogany cigar box with a golden placard too worn down to read and two hundred-dollar bills. He lays the bills on the table and sets the box down. I toss him the 11 baggies in the rubber band. 

Beth pulls a syringe out of her purse for herself and one for me. She hands it to me. Martin is making clanking and tapping sounds with what I guess is a spoon and a lighter and whatever else he‚Äôs using. I can‚Äôt see what he‚Äôs doing on the other side of the box. The rubber band snaps. Beth touches my shoulder with a plastic bottle cap. She has one for herself, and we repeat the process of the day before. Beth sterilizes her arm with alcohol and ties off. I just start digging in the meat of my forearm, right away. Martin has his foot on the table, looking for a vein in his foot. Soon, all three of us are leaning forward in our seats, like we‚Äôre playing some weird game of who can get their foreheads closest to the table without touching it. 

‚Äú‚Ä¶So good,‚Äù comes out of Beth‚Äôs mouth in a whisper. There‚Äôs some indistinct mumbling on either side of the words.


My eyes are closed. Chunks fill my mouth. I try to hold it in but fall out of my chair hurrying to the sink. The masticated chunks of pink, partially digested Spam spew onto the carpet. A nasty orange slime coats them like an afterbirth of the little aborted fetuses. They have a putrid stench, lying gross upon the floor. Shouldn‚Äôt have had that orange juice. I think to myself. Some more comes out. It burns my nose, and strings of the stinky slime hang from my chin. 

Martin is out, though. I got what I came for. Better get out of here, before he wakes up and starts complaining about the vomit and its smell. So, I shake Beth awake and tell her we have to go. It‚Äôs hard for her to walk, but we get out and down the stairs to her car. She‚Äôs buckled up in the driver‚Äôs seat. I‚Äôm buckled up in the passenger‚Äôs seat.  We are both slumped forward and nodded out.

Learn from me!,"Ok so I'm no spring chicken is this dope game, been doing it for opiates for damn near a decade.   

I always had plenty of connects and was pretty plugged in to where the best dope was at and things just rolled along really smooth...

That was until 6 days ago, I had been working closely with my LONG TIME MAIN GUY and his guy like clockwork for the last few months since my relapse.  So wouldn't you know it the words thing happens, all 3 of the guys I go to just vanished!  The only explanation I can think of is they were all together and got busted or went out of town.  Something like this has never happened to me before.  The worst is I'm in a relapse for 3 months and before that I had like 9 months clean time so I deleted all my backups or they changed numbers.  Right now I'm a functional addict and work a demanding full time construction leadership role where a 20 man crew is depending on my skills.  There was no warning from my guys so I couldn't stock up or do anything to prepare.  I called Monday evening after work and was greeted with a disconnected phone.  So Ive been deathly sick everyday since, now 6 days with no change.  Tried Kratom and Lope, which did help but nothing major.  This is a terrible place to be in due to me not being able to just crawl in bed, I have to go to work and be on point.  I guess it could also be a blessing since it's forcing me to get clean lol.

Learn from my lesson here, no matter how smooth things have been going with your main plug, it never hurts to have a couple solid back up connects..and to keep them in rotation like spend a lil bit every week with them just so you what kind of dope they are working with.  It's really another story of getting to comfortable with a single routine.  It was going so good everyday for years that I just started not caring about other plugs and it bit me in the ass big time. 

It's a funny game this dope hustle, the users depend on their plugs, in order to have a functional life.  It becomes so much more important when ur working to get ur shit so your not puking and shitting your brains out all day.  The dealers honestly don't give two shits about your situation and that bothers me.  If they did just head out on vacation or something why not let me know so I could stock up.  

Lessons from this mess:
- Don't do opiates, you just can't win with these things
- Have backup plugs even if things are going perfect with your main source
- If you can manage to build an emergency stock pile, DO IT! I always wanted to take like .1 out of each gram I buy and place it in a nice sealed container, then after a stretch of good time there would be a couple grams for situations just like this..
- Try to establish a good line of communication with your plugs, maybe you can avoid this kind of mess
- BE THE PLUG, You don't have to worry about shit if you cut out the people in the middle

I guess this turned out to be more of a rambling complaint.  It's just beyond frustrating when you get the rug pulled out from under you.  I have plenty of money and I'm mobile but I'm stuck waiting and hoping their phones magically come back on.  Sure I found a backup to go thru, but it makes me mad pissing money down the drain for short sub par dope.  

Please share your similar stories of times your line on good dope just vanished without a trace...what did you do to get by?  Im just sitting here sick as hell twiddling my thumbs and praying to JJ looking for a blessing.  Feel free to share your stories of frustration with your sources, that's what this post is all about....",1537754530.0

I‚Äôve been on 16mg suboxone daily maintenance for about 3 and 1/2 weeks. This weekend, I wanna have a little fun and revisit my oxy smokin habit. I like to smoke the real, pharma oxy 30s and I also like the ones pressed with fent (I know all the dangers, whatever whatever I‚Äôm an experienced opiate user). 

So, I‚Äôm probably gonna cop one or two of each, as I have solid plugs for the real deals, as well as other plugs that openly advertise that their blues are pressed. 

Basically my question is:

Will I have any luck with the oxy if I wait at least 24hr from my last bupe dose? I believe the fent is strong enough to break through even if I‚Äôve taken bupe the same day, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong ",1537749125.0

This is my very first post on reddit and it's surely for a reason. It's not very easy to find information about this kind of stuff or at least that's how it appears after a few searches, so I've decided to ask this lovely community for help. Please let me be very clear, this is NOT an attempt to purchase, find where to purchase, make or sell anything. My goal is to create a 1 for 1 xanax press in a game I'm developing. The game is all about roleplaying life and I want to develop a beautifully looking xanax feature for those who roleplay as a drug dealer.

* I need to know how Xanax is made.
* I would like to create a 3D model of a press, assuming that's what is used when creating it so I need some images of what it would look like.
* What're the different types of xanax? I've seen different colors associated with dosage I believe?
* What are the commercial/homemade ways it's made?
* What ingredients are used and which are legal / illegal?

Thank you, have a great day,

I would like to read all of your responses.

I've had a 90-120mg oxy insufflation addiction for at least 2 years.   Ive been taking them for about 6 years but these last 2 years have drained my account and they aren't fun anymore at all.  Heres the kicker.. my wife is in the same spot.  Her's started after a car accident 7 years ago and I started eating her 15's.  It started innocently enough where her 120 tab a month script would fulfill us both... and as you know the rest is history.  The last year we run out at about the 10 day mark and this starts the 2 hour round trips to pick up dropping several hundred at a clip every handful of days and I'm disgusted. We're practically broke now.  We've decided that she's going into an inpatient detox while I brave the storm in the real world.  I've got work to attend to and there's no chance I can just lay in bed.   The good part is my job is flexible so I can schedule things accordingly but I do have to be on at the very least my ""C game"" to manage my people at work.  I've also got children to get to school and pick up...feed.. ..after school activities.. etc etc. She checks in tomorrow and I've got enough to get me through to this evening.   Tonight it starts and I'm scared.  She's the rock here and now I'm needing to handle all my shit and the normal daily doings of hers wth the kids.  We made this decision because we're each others worst enemy in terms of enabling and I think the approx 5 day split will be the best route. I have plenty of Kratom (tried it when I got it and it was cool but def liked sniffing my pills more and put it aside as I knew this day was coming) some tizanidine (muscle relaxer) and 2 valiums  .. that's it.

He tells me it is NOT. He says it WILL tar up but due to its refined level and purity, it won‚Äôt under normal circumstances.  

So basically, let‚Äôs mentally work this out.  Mexican BTH is typically a little bit of heroin acetate, with a lot of 6-MAM salts.  Now let‚Äôs refine it so that it‚Äôs TAN not black or dark brown, and so that its a powder normally, not sticky clumps.  

Im thinking, to get my money‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôll have to freeze it, grind it, give a little inositol shake up, and slow microwave treatment until it‚Äôs ALL moisture is gone and the hydroscopic properties are fucked.  Then, after scraping the powder off the plate, I should be left with snortable powder that I wont be worried about keeping in a normal bag.  Idk.  Im frustrated he didnt say anYthing sooner.  Tan fucking powder?? Okay but if it can tar up, it aint a POWDER. Its a temporarily dry and crushed version of tar. Fuck.",1537719341.0

If someone falls out do not panic. If they are breathing ok monitor them until they wake up and put them in the ""recovery position"" if there breathing becomes too shallow call the paramedics the ""good samaritan law"" is in place in most places in the US and you and the victim of od will be immune to drug charges not related to dealing. If Their breathing stops begin CPR and administer Narcan as soon as possible. People have been saved by cpr alone. You wont die if your lungs are getting oxygen. 

If you don't use for a day or more due to choice or means out of your control (getting arrested) DO NOT use the same amount of opiates as you were before the break. Tolerance Drops FAST and this is how many people have died

Opiates should not be combined with benzodiazepines for recreation. Better and smarter men then us have died of it. (im one to talk i fucking love it)

I did it, and I only brought enough to drive for 4 days.
Got here, did a methadone taper, and have been clean for a few months.
But... I wanted to get high. since I don't know anybody here and I'm fairly certain they don't have heroin here (never seen anything like it. 50 people in line at the methadone clinic and none of them have ever tried heroin. Is it all pills.).
I had never tried meth or ice before but I figured high is a high. Ummm... No the f*** it's not. I don't even know how to describe how upsetting the last 6 days have been. First, I bought$100 worth because I didn't know how it comes, I started shooting a little bit at a time. every time I get a hit I'd feel dazed and confused for a couple minutes and then not high. or at least, not anything I would have considered to be fun. 4 days in a row I spent hours trying to hit myself. My arms had completely healed in the months I've been here. Now, I can't find a vein anywhere on my body and I am covered in track marks and bruises. I've got no clue why anyone would do such a thing to themselves, and I assure you I won't do it again but now here I am-at my real question. 
When I bought the ice from the guy, I asked him if he knew where to get any heroin. Today he knocked on my door with 10 mg Roxy's. It's not H, but I almost cried when I saw them. It was like my long-lost lover coming back from war. 
I spent a ridiculous amount of time reading posts about how to break it down and get it ready, and now I can't hit. Like, for real, not my feet, not my legs, not my arms. The state I'm in does not allow syringe sale without a prescription and the only place that seems willing to sell them is Walmart, and they only have 1/2 ml 31g, 5/16 ones. With such a short needle, my femoral is out. I just can't get to it. I've never hit in my neck before- I'm not necessarily scared but I can't find a good post telling me what's safe (er) and how to avoid an artery.
I triple filtered the Roxy so I'm not worried about getting particles or fillers in my vein. 
I'm super annoyed that the largest capacity needle they sell is the 1/2 ml because I've got four of them. There was no way to condense it with the amount of water needed to break down the pills. 
That was really long winded, but can somebody please give me a little jugular vein run down, unless you have a really good idea that I haven't thought of yet.

I‚Äôm only 19. Was hooked on Oxycontin for almost a year of my life, March 2017 to November 2017. Snorted as soon as I got up, middle of the day on break/transitioning classes (first semester of a paid scholarship to UNCG), and would snort the rest of the oxy i had for the day and popped whatever opiod pills I could cop for cheap at night; nodding my life away. I would smoke weed all throughout the day as well. I like to believe I was a functioning addict, but I know that I was just functioning enough to get by and not lose my job or have my grades go to shit. 

Lived with family who highly disapproved of any drug usage at all. They knew about the weed, would always threaten to kick me out. Which then happened in November, however, they never knew about the pills until I told them that night. Had nowhere to go and couldn‚Äôt live on my own because all my money went into pills and weed. This was right before Thanksgiving, family now wanting nothing to do with me. Ended up staying with a friend for about a week which I was withdrawing horribly until I checked myself into a ten day rehab detox program. 

Been clean since November 18th, 2017. 

I appreciate being sober because I realize how much of an impact it had on my life. Never went back to school, was forced anyways by my family, lost all connection with my family and have no one but my mom now who is states away and a couple friends where I‚Äôm at now. Been attending NA meetings every Sunday.

I do enjoy smoking every now and then, all in moderation - but I realized I can never touch any opiod again, especially after trying lean in May thinking I might be able to recreationally enjoy any opiod again. Was able to control myself along with some supportive friends.

I still live day by day struggling on my own working two part time jobs, and sometimes wish I can go back and never have dug the hole I put myself in because I knew I had so much opportunity to do well yet all I cared about was the next pill i‚Äôm crushing up.

If you took the time to read this, thank you. I never have gotten to tell my story to much of anyone; I like to keep to myself.

So as a result I kindly walked down the street to drop off the chair. Cliff asked why I haven't been around of why I was not answering messages. I just kinda bullshitted an apology because I didn't want to take on a accusatory tone which then would result in having hear his counterarguments.

""I been keeping my distance because...""

Then he'd say. ""No I don't..."" I just dont really want to even play that game. I fully expect gaslighting and hate dealing with that shit.


&nbsp;

So anyway today he called and texted while I was legitimately at work. Not pretending to at work as is often the case.


After I stated my status he texted the following:



> I Dont need bread, i have food etc.  Could u stop in after its personal ? I Cant tell anyone on planet but u its personal but ud understand and i cant type


Now, as much as I'd hate to be inhumane and unreasonable uncaring about this but I'd also hate to u unsurprisingly surprised. How so? As the saga has gone before... an inconvenient request. He doesn't needs money he says but perhaps he needs something that costs money?


I don't have any desire of stopping by his house after work to find out. I'm sure I'll know what is up by Monday but I'm open to speculation.",1537662578.0

(I now a lot of you guys are not fans of this drug at all, or even loathe it, but for me personally, it's what got me addicted, and I'm actually able to have just as much, and even more, euphoria on this stuff as I do on heroin so, you know man, we all have different experiences). Thanks lads--and everybody else, too, I'm just Irish so sometimes I like to use it a bit like the gender neutral ""guys"" when talkin bout groups. Now let's get into this.

So as I mentioned, I'm high on codeine right now. The lights are off, I'm lying in my bed, have been for a while. Now, I know what nodding feels like, so when I was on my phone and noted that I could barely keep my eyes open, I presumed I was fighting the nod. I decided to give in and put my phone down (or didn't, and ""giving in"" was a much less conscious choice), let my eyes close and enjoy the ride. Well, I don't even really remember too well, but all I know is that suddenly (or not suddenly? It feels like it's been a while since then so honestly I don't even bloody know, but it happened alright?) I was having these strange, very strange because as far as I know I've never had this before, sober or high, lucid dream visions while my eyes were closed. It looked exactly like a dream, it felt exactly like one too (like the way I was moving in it and stuff, how that felt), the only thing that I believe was different is that I felt... conscious?  I think. When it happened I was certain, but now I'm not so sure, it all feels so much more hazy. Like, I was somehow ""aware"" where my body was, that I was still high lying in bed, I was aware what was happening, but yet still, something, as I look back, did feel ""different"". God, so odd and challenging to describe. 

Anyway, I'll move on. The visions? I was in the ocean. It felt aimless, and the ocean was dark. There were lots of fish. I know that the reason this was the setting is because I watched Finding Dory today (don't fucking judge, okay?). Before I realised this I believe I was just, here comes this word again, swimming around aimlessly without me being conscious, like not conscious not even as not awake like in a normal dream, but even aware of my existence or something. I felt I was just gone, but obviously, didn't acknowledge that I was gone. Now, after I was snapped back, I had this epiphany like, why the fuck am I in the ocean? I don't even want to be here, I don't like it being here and I'm fucking in control, I literally have the choice to leave, it's my goddamn dream! Some shit like that. So then I start trying to leave, I feel weird, not good and increasingly trapped till I start talking to some fish and then boom, I fucking jerk actually awake with the BIGGEST bloody jolt man, it was nuts.

My memory of what I described is getting weaker and weaker by the minute so, glad I wrote that down. But seriously though guys, is that normal or something? Is that nodding? Because whenever I've nodded out until now it's always just been falling in and out of conscious and my head hanging and my mouth wide open. Typical junkie pose. So what's up with this?? Maybe to most of you it's actually nothing but to me it was so very weird, so seriously, I'd really appreciate some words.

I found a couple of papers (open access, playa) which discuss the kinds of heroin (powder vs. BTH) sold in the us, where they come from, what users think of different kinds, and the health consequences of their use, among other things.

&nbsp;

I found them pretty interesting (particularly the 2016 one) and thought you guys might enjoy them as well (or at least reading the abstracts/results and shooting the shit about them). Here are some questions I have that might help to get discussion going:

1. Are the findings of these articles in line with your experience as users?

2. Do you feel that market has changed substantially in the last few years with the rise of fentanyl and potent analogues? 

3. To what extent is branding/reputation relevant in heroin sales/purchasing specifically? 

Let me know what you think!

[**The Textures of Heroin: User Perspectives on ‚ÄúBlack Tar‚Äù and Powder Heroin in Two US Cities (2016)**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5027195/)

ABSTRACT: 

Since the 1990s, US heroin consumers have been divided from the full range of available products: east of the Mississippi River, Colombian-sourced powder heroin (PH) dominates the market, while to the west, Mexican-sourced ‚Äúblack tar‚Äù (BTH) is the main heroin available. By conducting qualitative research in two exemplar cities, Philadelphia (PH) and San Francisco (BTH), we compare users‚Äô experiences of heroin source-types, markets, health consequences and consumption preferences. The strict division of heroin markets may be changing with novel forms of powder heroin appearing in San Francisco. Our researchers and interviewees perceived vein loss stemming from the injection of heroin alone to be a particular problem of BTH while among the Philadelphia sample, those who avoided the temptations of nearby cocaine sales displayed healthier injecting sites and reported few vein problems. Abscesses were common across both sites, the Philadelphia sample generally blaming missing a vein when injecting cocaine and the San Francisco group finding several explanations, including the properties of BTH. Consumption preferences revealed a ‚Äòconnoisseurship of potency‚Äô, with knowledge amassed and deployed to obtain the strongest heroin available. We discuss the reasons that their tastes take this narrow form and its relationship to the structural constraints of the heroin market.

&nbsp;

[**Heroin in brown, black and white: Structural factors and medical consequences in the US heroin market (2009)**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704563/)

ABSTRACT: 

Heroin coming into the United States historically comes from three widely dispersed geographical regions: Southwest Asia, Southeast Asia and Mexico. A fourth source of US-bound heroin, from Colombia, originated in the early 1990s. The fact that the four heroin sources produce differing morphologies and qualities of heroin has not been critically examined. In addition, it is not well established how the contemporary competing dynamics of interdiction, or restriction of heroin flows across international boundaries, and neoliberal, e.g., global expansion of free trade, policies are affecting heroin markets. This paper will highlight changes in the US heroin market, including source trends, the political economy of the now dominant source and the resultant effects on the heroin risk environment by US region.

&nbsp;

I'm really interested to hear what you guys think about these findings, and I'd love to see some discussion. Stay safe out there and take care of each other!

It's just that lost longing feeling and a weight in my chest making it hard to breathe and the craving of warmth.

I work in withdrawal I live in withdrawal, they never told me about that part when I started. Buy the ticket take the ride, on down the lost highway. No money for Kratom, no money for relief. I'd rather suffer through it and get all my enjoyment all at once. People ask me why I put myself through it but I say fuck'em cause they'll never know and I hope and pray to God they don't. Heaven and hell on earth all at one time my brothers and sisters. We have transcended the plane of this world too many times. While some make it back to earth, some with help and some without. Some never make it back, be it the longest run of their life or the final dose that ended them. I'm not depressed, I'm lethargic and can't sleep, hungry and can't eat, I'm a walking contradiction and love every minute of it. If you can't take the good with the bad, brother this ain't the ride for you. ",1537624102.0

You can‚Äôt fucking sleep and then when you do finally get to ‚Äúsleep‚Äù you wake up with hot sweats less than an hour later and you had a dream you and your best friend with hella warrants got spotted in your car and you have to fuckin play hot speed pursuit on a one street in a small town with guns and two safes. then your boy jumps out of the fucking car at like 30 mph and you get woken up right before your fucking dream to see if the cop stopped for him or went after me. In my dream I told him I‚Äôd take it but he told me to fuck off w that &amp;amp; my clean record, then of course he jumps out so saves n all the guns but one r in there üòÖ. Fuck you dreams and fuck you sick bullshit.

TWO. Two lovely hits to just relax after a long night tending. Soon three or four at night two in the morning. I‚Äôm sure you all know the pattern- well most of us. I thought I fucking had it. I already miss having my fucking shit together, that extra 60-80 a day not including the white n benzos I need to keep up w work. but physically I‚Äôm fucked n my body was already hurting before I went n inebriated myself beyond my norm.

The  reason being no needles, I really don‚Äôt want to die- just temporarily remove those suicidal idolizing, anxiety crippling (*not seasonal*) depression and the fucked back from only ever working service industry.

On top of this I got into a fight with the plug over the dumbest shit. He thought I fucked his wife (I didn't but she wants it) and I said his pressed bars seemed weak since I ate 4 of them with very little tolerance(had a badly infected foot and was in extreme pain and just wanted it to stop) and didn't pass out or black out. He got super butthurt. On top of all this I'm in some mandated drug class shit for probation where I must attend weekly classes and get drug tested. I failed my last drug test and my PO totally spared me but now I have to do these classes and doubt she'd spare me again. 
                       All of this came together as a perfect storm of telling me it's time to stop. As bad as I hated it I quit cold turkey. No benzos or anything. I couldn't get any. I had/have no money at all and can't work anything out w plug bc he's butthurt. Well today is like day 5 of no drugs and I was doing some cleaning and found .3 of some fire brown in a watch pocket in a pair of my jeans. Fml! I'd been doing everything I could to avoid getting high. Didn't answer calls from ppl wanting me to middle, didn't hang out w my normal group of friends bc 1 might see me sick and offer to help. I just stayed in my room hating everything. Fml why'd I have to find it? I actually got a tiny bit of sleep last night and even though it was in tiny increments and restless as fuck it was a super great sign. This morn I ate for the 1st time in 3 or 4 days bc I can't eat in wds and then when I think of something I can eat it's something we don't have or I can't afford. There's absolutely nothing here to eat but I found a decent size power bar and ate it. I know it isn't much but when it's literally been like 4 days with 0 food it made me feel much better. 
              I'm not usually the type to forget any of my drugs at all but I'd had a few good come ups and was going balls out so extremely I forgot a fucking .3 in another pair of pants. Right as I'm making my way thru the end of the withdrawal tunnel and into the light of being well. It's crazy how stuff works out sometimes. Now that I did a nice shot I realize I'm hungry af and need to eat. So that will be my goal for today lol find some way for food. I wish it could've been 1 of you guys who found dope it honestly is terrible for me. I'd almost made it. I'm going to do it all today and see how bad it's set me back. How are all of you doing?

Could you just put some iso alcohol on it to kill any bacteria, then evaporate the iso alcohol, and shoot it without any worry of cotton fever? And also, iso alcohol wont leave any residue after it evaporates that could harm you if injected, correct?

I got 2 kinds of dopes in my gram a few days ago. Half of it was grey powder and tiny pebbles of dope that id been getting for a week now, and the other half was one chunk of similar looking grey dope. I didnt even notice the chunk was different until i got home and cut a piece off the chunk, put it in the spoon, and put water on it.

So,  with all the bad shit and even dope thats cut with synthetic pot that makes you trip balls horribly, i just didnt even feel like testing the new shit till the morning at least and did the shit i knew was good. 

I heated it slowly several times and evaporated 95% of the water that was in the spoon, then let the last bit evaporate on its own so i didnt burn the dope. I tried it and the new shit was also good, so now im to where i gotta do the 2 fat shots left in the spoon in the morning.  Im probably good to just do it, but i really don't wanna get cotton fever ever again in my life.

Only the shell of who I once was is reminiscent, depicted by this strange character who goes trough life pretending. 

Just Like a newborn chick escapes the hard walls of a broken egg, my soul had escaped my worn out body. 

In my eyes was an empty stare. As empty as the emotions in my still, somehow beating heart. 

Like an apocalyptic zombie from a fictional novel, I went trough life. Never being noticed, I desperately and silently screamed for help, without ever being heard. 

The seemingly never ending struggle would dramatically come to end like a play with a plot twist; the realization that The Dragon was chasing me.

Thick layers of warmth, creeping slowly up the length of my broken body
consuming me at once, erasing all introverted feelings of torment

Agony; despair; self-hatred

All quickly diminished with the steady burn of a dancing flame, a deep, lasting breath, inviting the ultimate escape

Sliding down the glistening smooth, silver surface, releasing a deathly beautiful swirl of creamy, irresistible bliss

Temptation takes over

Slowly and carefully, I inhale, inhale as if it's my last breath; yearning for this ecstasy to continue forever

Spectacular bitter smoke curls into my open mouth, finding its way to my eager lungs

i hold my breath, my hazel eyes closed gently to block out anything that could possibly interrupt this perfect moment

Seconds later, I exhale, my tense body suddenly relaxed and my heavy eyelids flutter open, only a ghost escaping my lips

The feeling is sublime

Dark shadows of my past- regret, shame, mania, confusion...

The weight is instantly lifted and replaced by pure and utter enjoyment

No longer am I overwhelmed with such intense sadness

No longer am I so submerged in dwelling on the past

No worrying about the future

There is here and there is now, and that is all there is

It is euphoria.",1537579926.0

This idea that if you can find a government-sanctioned doctor to give you a government permission slip (prescription) that you're somehow magically better than other opiate takers and that only you deserve opiates because you're a ""legitimate patient"" and they're ""abuser addicts"" is a fucking joke.

I'm an adult. I and everyone else has the right to treat our own pain or whatever else however we see fit. All opiates should be re-legalized OTC dirt cheap as aspirin tomorrow just like they used to be.

But until then.

Me treating my pain without a permission slip doesn't make me any more of an ""addict"" than someone with one.

Anymore than if insulin was made illegal tomorrow and certain diabetics couldn't get permission slips and had to do desperate shit and deal with the black market would make them ""insulin addicts"" while the ones with permission slips were simply ""insulin dependent"". No. You're still the same. One group is just a more obvious victim of prohibition.

But yeah, back to the self-described ""legitimate pain patients"".

The ones who hate on other opiate takers seem to be mostly middle aged women (not hating on middle aged women in any way, this has just been my experience).

Like bitch you take 8 oxy 30s a day for your fibromyalgia and you're just a ""dependent patient"".

While my friend who takes 4 30s a day for his treatment resistant suicidal depression and is the only medicine that allows him to function is an ""abuser addict"" all because he doesn't have a fucking piece of paper with some scribbles on it?

The funny thing is he could easily get a fibro diagnosis and then magically overnight he'd go from being this lady's sworn enemy to a fellow pain sufferer.

Basically it seems like a ""I got mine, fuck everyone else"" attitude with these people.

And I have some serious fucking chronic pain issues. So it makes me sick when people lose access to opiates.

But these types can eat a dick.

Sorry for the long rant.

I just see these types ALL OVER!

Basically what it comes down to is ""addiction, abuse, etc."" are all legal definitions that appeal to authority.

The definition of ""addict"" or ""abuser"" essentially comes down to non-government approved medicating.

After all, cigarette smokers, insulin takers, antidepressent users, etc. aren't called ""drug addicts"" who need to be forced into ""treament"" for their ""drug abuse"".

Add to the fact that all the problems blamed on ""illegal opiate use"" are 100% caused by prohibiton, and the distinction becomes a joke.

After all, if you lived in the UK and had a pure heroin prescription that cost you $20/week you would have NONE of the problems blamed on so-called ""addiction"".

You would simply live a normal life and people literally couldn't tell the difference between the clear liquid in your rig and the clear liquid in a diabetic's.

So, in conclusion, this is really a plea to my fellow chronic pain sufferers.

Realize that all opiate takers are in this together and that the prohibition of opiates by definition hurts us all.

We've all had that doctor (or dozen!) that doesn't ""believe"" our pain is ""real"".

Which is why we have the phrase - Pain is what the person says it is.

So stop letting the government win by using its age old divide and conquer strategy on us.

We're ALL adults and have the right to take whatever medicine WE as INDIVIDUALS see fit. 

Hopefully one day this right is recognized again and prescription laws are abolished.

None of us is any more ""legitimate"" than anyone else.

Imagine if the cannabis movement had let infighting between so-called ""medicinal"" and so-called ""recreational"" groups consume them?

Would you be able to walk into a store and buy cannabis OTC today like you can in some states if the cannabis movement spent its time arguing over who was a ""legitimate"" cannabis taker?

Of course not!

And neither should we who take opiates!

We're all humans. What we have in common is that we consume poppy plant matter. We need to stick together to undo the damage caused by the last 100 years of opiophobia instead of letting our opposition tear us apart.

I‚Äôve been wanting to get clean for a while now since I don‚Äôt get much out of using anymore. I only use so that I‚Äôm not sick and am able to go to work and care for my daughter.   I didn‚Äôt know where to turn to for recovery, so I just followed in my friends footsteps and went to a Suboxone clinic. The doctor was very professional and informative. Patients in the lobby raved about him as well as people as well as online. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the best way to handle my addiction, but whatever, I guess we‚Äôll see

I‚Äôm fortunate enough to make enough money to pay for all my bills, daycare, and every day expenses. Paycheck advance apps have also been helping me when needed recently. I am completely over this life tho...staying well being  my main job, and my actual job is just what brings in money along with a few other hustles. Tired of it.

 I use about 1-1.3g of heroin every day. I‚Äôm a snorter. Never thought about shooting and don‚Äôt have any plans to ever do it. Since I use everyday and have for a few years without stopping, I haven‚Äôt had to go thru WDs very much. This is what kind of scares me. I just finished my last line and I feel very committed to not use again.

So, I have my prescription ready...not 100% sure if I will even use it when it‚Äôs time to but I‚Äôm ready. The doctor said to wait 36-48 hours if I remember if correctly, so the plan is to take my first sub around 12PM-6PM EST on Sunday 9/13. WDs are gonna be hell right? Right...

I don‚Äôt remember why I even decided to post this. Anyways...fellow guys and gals...I‚Äôm pretty nervous and that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs on my mind now. Let me know what y‚Äôall think...should keep me distracted throughout the night . Hopefully I can sleep tonight. 

Oh yeah btw, this is my first attempt at ‚Äúgetting clean‚Äù. Never been to any sort of rehab, doctor, program or been on any medication like Suboxone before.

It's going pretty well, haven't missed or OD'd yet. I have one question though, I hope it's not too noob-ish.

Sometimes I slip out of the vein, I notice it pretty quickly because I re-register as often as possible. When that happens, I can usually find the vein again by pushing the needle in a little further or (occasionally) going back a little. Are you supposed to do it like that or should you pull out entirely and start over? I think the latter might cause more trauma to the vein because you're making a bunch of holes, but the former solution might cause you to widen the hole. I definitely don't ""wiggle"" the needle around, i.e. the angle stays the same and it's just a back-and-forth movement.

This past weekend he said he tossed his methadone away because he knew it made me uncomfortable (which is not the case, the lying, secrecy, and abusing it with other substances that won't show up on a drug panel is what is bothering me). Said he started going through withdrawal. Around hour 72 he started having... what almost looked like seizures. He would lose control of his body, was falling hard (hit his head and face several times).. it was horrifying. I ended up having to call 911.

Was what I was seeing withdrawal or had his potentially 1) took way too much of his methadone or 2) combined it with something else? In what I've been reading I haven't seen much about muscle spasms associated with withdrawal, only overdose.

Hey guys I figured now is the time to share one of my craziest stories of doing/buying drugs in the hood.

So a few years ago I had just switched to subs after a year of dope. This was because all the dope when to shit and was hardly heroin at all. Anyway the subs gave me bad side effects such as insomnia, jaw tension and anxiety and my dope dealer also had xanax so I would see him for that every once in a while.

One day i went to see him and he had me park in the middle of the fucking hood in a parking lot of a dilapidated store. I was waiting there for about 20 mins when some guy who was probably in his mid twenties pulls up next to me and says hey you need bars? And i say how did you know? and he says ""you dont look like a dope junky and your white"" and i say ""oh thanks"" and he offers me 4 for twenty which was a much better deal then i would have gotten. So i buy them and he smoked me down on a blunt while drinking lean lol

Fast forward 2 months him and I actually become good friends and he would ask me for rides around town and smoke me down on tons of blunts and give me free bars all day. He also liked xan but his main thing was lean. He went by kurt. one day he introduces me to his girlfriend and she says ""im still so scared from the last time you got shot"" and i ask him ""you got shot?"" and hes like yea a few times actually. The first time hit his thigh and he had a bullet scar there. Then he was driving down the main road one day in the hood and had his car light up and one bullet fucked up his hand. He didnt go to the hospital for that one and his hand had a nasty scar on it. Then he got shot in the back a and you could feel the bullet if you touched his upper chest next to his fucking heart. The doctors couldn't remove the bullet as it was too close to the heart.

I also meet some of his gang friends we smoked a few blunts in a little shitty park in the hood just me and 4 big black dudes must have looked ridiculous it was a blast.

So one day he hits me up and says he fucked up making crack because he added baking powder instead of baking soda. He says he needs to bring it across town to a trap I say dont wanna drive with a big jar of coke water in my car he sys hell give me a few bars and well smoke and talks me into it. I drive him across town and he gets it fixed. then we take some xans and smoke and get back in my car to go somewhere else. all of a sudden he yells at me to turn down a sketchy alley.

I ask him whats going on and he says the cops saw him and i was about to get pulled over and to give him my glass bowl and anything else illegal i had. luckily i didn't have anything else. He takes them and runs away. I pull out of the alley to be surrounded by 4 cop cars 2 of which say ""gangs drugs and guns task force"" on the cars. I stop and 6 cops run at my car guns drawn yelling.

They pull me out the car and say ""If we dont find dope in the car you can go"" and they rip apart my car find nothing and let me fucking leave.

Maybe that‚Äôs why I reached out to one of Tim‚Äôs best friends that he made while locked up these passed six years. ‚ÄúListen, I know you don‚Äôt know me outside of what Tim has said and the few times we‚Äôve spoken on the phone but I need a person who knows people.‚Äù 

I need a person who knows junkies. I‚Äôm too pretty, too addicted, and too white to do any type of hustling in the big city without getting robbed. I might be a scumbag but I‚Äôm not an idiot. 

Tim and Jason stayed in touch after Jason got released a year ago. I‚Äôve gotten to know him a bit as he reached out to my mother and I after his release and said he loved Tim and would do whatever he could to help us with him. I‚Äôve always had a good judge of character and I immediately liked Jason the first time I talked to him on the phone. He looked out for Tim that first year they were together.  Tim was a baby and Jason had about fifteen years on him. They were fast friends when they first met in a Texas Gladiator School six years ago. Jason was on his second stay in TDCJ and helped Tim fight when he first went in at age 19. They shared an entire year together and then one more 8 month stint before Jason got his freedom again a year ago. Jason looked out for the baby boy while we all adjusted to prison life in that first year. I‚Äôm forever in his debt. Now that Arnold is dead and left me all this dope, I knew I needed to find another convict to help me finish off the junkie life and finally stay clean. 

Jason listens quietly to me as my voice shakes a bit while spitting out those words. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on your mind, young lady? Why do you need a person who knows people? Better yet, why do you need an ex-convict who knows people?‚Äù Jason has a southern twang to his voice that reminds me of home. ‚ÄúWell, it seems I‚Äôve come into a bit of a pickle.‚Äù I went on to tell Jason everything about the black bag, and my utter incompetence for actually making money with them. 

‚ÄúSounds like you need to drop the Blue Bell Ice cream idea of eat all you can and sell the rest little lady! Your brother would shit if he knew I was even exchanging more than a hello with his big baby sister.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt know about this. Jason, can you help me or not?‚Äù I feel light as a feather talking to him. He tells me I did the right thing. He can get rid of them for me. He knows people. He knows junkies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in town in two weeks. I‚Äôll call you for your address. It will be late‚Äù I tell him. I make sure he knows I‚Äôm not afraid to come to his dwelling and do business with him. 

Jason sighs, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna have to trust me. You know I‚Äôve fucked over better people than you in my life?‚Äù I think it‚Äôs cute that Jason is trying to make sure I know I‚Äôm playing a big game. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt reach out to you because I thought your word was good. I reached out to you because I need to get rid of a large number of pills and make some quick cash before my life falls apart. It would do me good to get fucked over for once anyway.‚Äù Jason laughs, ‚Äúyou know, Tim talked about you all the time. He told me once if I ever met you I‚Äôd know why he was the way he was. I see it now. I‚Äôm not sure if the right sibling went to prison.‚Äù ‚ÄúFuck you Jason‚Äù I laughed. I can hear him smile through the phone, ‚Äú This bonds us for life, ya know? We‚Äôre family now. I fucked over a lot of people in my life but never my family.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine, Jason. I‚Äôll see you in two weeks.‚Äù 

I look down at my phone and me and Jason had talked for over an hour. A small pang of guilt hits my sober brain. Jason has been out exactly a year. I slithered into his life in the first year of his freedom. I hope I‚Äôm not why he ends up going back. If so, at least I‚Äôll have another set of eyes on the baby boy again. That thought is where I sit now, typing this out. Cheers to the next two weeks. The monkey on my back is starting to get heavier. ",1537546751.0

The first one must have been around 50, worked a good job, had a wife / kids and lived in a nice, quiet suburb. He also moved thousands of OC80's a month, this guy was *way* up the oxy chain. Once I earned his trust by buying through the dark web (back before SR, it's what us OG's called Source Boards) for a while he eventually just let me come to his house. It was great; I'd text / ring ahead, either pick up cash on the way or bank transfer it to him, park up outside and he'd be straight out. Perfect.

But as so many stories go, oxy started to get pretty expensive. I was paying ¬£20 for an 80, and when you're going through 3+ in a day the bill starts to add up *quick*.  
So I went out and found myself what I thought was a heroin dealer, but I would later learn was a shitty middle. The guy would have me drive over, pick him up, drive to the spot (but park at such an angle that I couldn't see what door it was), wait for him to go in, grab the gear then come back out. Turns out he was literally doubling the price, so if I wanted 4 ¬£10 bags I'd have to give him ¬£80. I knew he was ripping me off, he knew I knew, but every time I'd complain he'd always lie, then say ""if you don't like the price, go somewhere else"".  
Thankfully my luck changed one day when he showed up drunk and without enough credit to make the call. He used my phone, forgets to delete the number and I swoop in the next day to start buying direct.  
This guy was amazing, he'd sell from his house (although he moved every ~2 months to keep old bill off his trail), sold great gear and had no problem with me buying weight. He'd always weigh it out in front of me too, so I knew I was actually getting my moneys worth rather than just buying a load of ¬£10 bags.

Unfortunately all good things must come to an end, and when I moved back down South I had to start the hunt for a good dealer again.  
I spent a while in this new town and was never that impressed with any of the 5+ dealers I had - long waits, short bags, quality was never consistent etc etc.  
I recently moved back to my hometown and got in touch with these 2 girls, a couple that used to run a trap near me. We'd always got on well; I'd helped them move house in exchange for a few bags, driven them to appointments occasionally etc, so there was definitely some trust there. Turns out the main one got nicked and has been inside for a while / will be for a while longer. But the other one, a sober girl that was really only in it for the cash / because her gf was a heavy user offered to hook me up with someone she knew. She told me this person is super picky about who they sell to, so I better not fuck up and maker her look bad for recommending me.  
She introduces me and my god, it's like having my old Northern dealer back! Huge bags of consistently good gear, decent prices and best of all there's basically no waiting. Compared to the trash that other local guys are selling this is amazing.

Can't believe my luck to land a *third* amazing dealer, happy fukken days boys!!",1537541460.0

We knew it was coming sooner or later, but it still sucks. He was 34 years old and he left a young son behind (albeit estranged). He blamed the world, the courts, his ex, and her new bf for his predicament. There was no other perspective. It‚Äôs easy to see this in others. It‚Äôs difficult to see it in ourselves. 

I was 9 when my aunt brought him home from the hospital. We grew up together for a while and did the stuff kids do; built forts, played video-games, watched a ton of movies. We laughed a lot. 

Then we drifted into our own sordid drug sagas. I got clean first, then he did, then we took turns relapsing. He had legal troubles, while I never did. We never used together until last June (I wanted to terminate my last ‚Äòrelapse‚Äô) knowing that he was on a run too (having just come off probation). we got a brick apiece and blew through that in 36 hours... his tolerance was almighty. 

It sucks that the last time I saw him we were using together, but at least I got to spend time with him. However, I could tell that he wasn‚Äôt long for this world. No sense of harm reduction whatsoever. I finished my brick and left him there in squalor.

Now he‚Äôs gone. 

I reached out to him from treatment and also afterwards. I tried to mention him doing the same, but he was on his own path (of destruction). 

I wanted to write something somewhere about him. You guys know what I mean. Civilians don‚Äôt get it. A friend recently likened it to a plague... as if The Walking Dead is actually happening. We‚Äôve become inured to these deaths, and the dead are simply forgotten. All his son will know is that his dad was a junky. That he didn‚Äôt care about him. That‚Äôs the farthest from the truth. I think we care too much. We want it all fixed right now. Then when shit doesn‚Äôt work out, we go back to the last thing that worked...

I‚Äôm rambling.

So I've slowly reduced down to 0.4mg of buprenorphine every day from 4mg 18 months ago or so. I'm struggling to take it properly every day and it's become a bit of an addiction in itself so I'm ready to stop taking it altogether. I'm not sure why but when I snort my dose it does get me a nice buzz. Not ""high"" as such, but I definitely get a nice mellow slightly opiated feeling and a bit of drowsiness. I'm guessing I got on subs too eagerly or maybe I'm just naturally susceptible to their effects. But either way I'm a little anxious about how bad withdrawals will be because they effect me even at such a low dose.

My keyworker seems to think that 0.4mg is nothing and I should be fine, and I hope he's right, but I've heard some horror stories. It varies a lot I'm guessing, some people say they've come off at >=1mg without too many withdrawals while others say coming off even 0.2mg was hard.

I've got myself 3.5g of weed and 10\*10mg diazepam tablets. Does weed help with withdrawals much? I would guess it makes the anxiety a lot worse, so I got the diazepam for that. Obviously I won't take it for more than a week max. It will be the first time in years I'll be without some kind of opiate in my system so I'm kinda nervous. I guess I'm mostly asking if I'll feel many withdrawals *(edit: More than 5 withdrawals and I'm done lol)* and how well the weed and Valium will help, but I know it's not something anyone can be accurate about, just wondered if anyone had any advice or encouraging experiences.

Thanks :)

Bonus unrelated question: Should you capitalise drug names? I mean if they're brand names sure, but buprenorphine? Buprenorphine? diazepam or Diazepam? I'd guess they're proper nouns so I think I'll capitalise in the future.",1537534674.0

Life is great like this. It takes a whole lotta work to be able to function again like a normal human. I would cut my dick off before going back to shooting dope again. üëåü§ò",1537509329.0

Beth‚Äôs mouth hangs open, and her gaze is fixed on me as I talk on the phone.
	
She‚Äôs got these brittle little pebble teeth set far apart from one another in her gums. They‚Äôre not particularly crooked or stacked in rows like some people‚Äôs, but they‚Äôre definitely not straight. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. She‚Äôs pretty. Her big brown eyes and thin face work really will with the way she keeps her hair, which is short. She‚Äôs just had her struggles with drugs in life and like the rest of us, our teeth give us away. I run my tongue along the jagged crater in one of my own teeth. 

 
When we first started hanging out, Beth used to wear these cheap falsies that were always falling out and separating from her eyelids. She even used to have her nails all done up and wore those dumb three hundred-dollar pairs of jeans with all that bling on the back pockets. You know the ones I‚Äôm talking about, right? But not anymore. I think it was because she‚Äôd just gotten sober and her best friend from the rehab she‚Äôd been in was into all of that. It never seemed to fit on Beth. Anyway, by the time she had her baby, that other girl had moved on to someone else and Beth went back to wearing the Pink Floyd shirts and green army jackets and cheap second-hand jeans with the frayed heels and old skater shoes. All of that is more her style. 

Her fingernails are bleedy, ragged nubs which tells me she‚Äôs using, again. She‚Äôs chewing one now. The child is smashing one of her toys against the table and making snotty noise with her mouth. I‚Äôm not sure how bad Beth‚Äôs using, but I‚Äôm about to find out. 

Sal asks me how many I want on the phone. He never told me how much they cost, so I just tell him that I‚Äôve got 120 bucks. Beth licks her bottom lip and leans forward, while Sal says he‚Äôll give me a deal over the phone. He tells me to call him back in ten minutes to find out where to go. 

I hang up, and she asks, 

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSal.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I know him?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should. He‚Äôs tall. Got black hair. You don‚Äôt know Sal? He goes to meetings. Well, he was going to meetings for like the last two years. You‚Äôve seen him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got the limp and his right arm is all beat back.‚Äù

She shakes her head.

‚ÄúDee Dee is his girlfriend. You know the one with the blond hair and crazy green eyes. She‚Äôs always going off at the meetings about her dad and how he molested her growing up and all of that.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, yeah! So, her boyfriend?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the story.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs working?‚Äù There‚Äôs a quiver in her voice. 

‚ÄúMmhmm.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you gonna get?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think I‚Äôm gonna get, Beth?‚Äù

‚ÄúDope.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood guess.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah. Well, I didn‚Äôt know you were using. I thought you were going on like two years, here soon. What about that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot now.‚Äù I shrug. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs about to call back. Are you wanting in on this or what?‚Äù

Beth looks at the kid. She looks back up at me. ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôll give you a ride.‚Äù

A melon headed kid collects shopping carts in the Fred Meyer‚Äôs parking lot.


Beth is sitting in the driver‚Äôs seat. She is gripping the steering wheel and pulling herself forward and holding her breath. She wears a maroon knit cap. Her kid is in the back in a car seat eating Goldfish from a plastic cup. The interior has been plastered with thrown food items and the multicolored paste of saliva soggy cereal. It gives the car a distinct smell, the way hamster cages have that distinct smell but different. You know, the mixture of bedding and food and the different biological excretions all mixed together in a poorly ventilated container? 
	
My phone rings. I answer. Sal tells me he‚Äôs at the Starbuck‚Äôs and will be out in a minute. I tell him we‚Äôre in a brown Civic with a grey door and hood by the outdoor section. Only a few minutes pass before he‚Äôs jumping into the back seat and sitting next to the baby. I pull out my money. Sal shows me a rubber band wrapped number of the same D.O.A. baggies from the day before, but they‚Äôre all inside of another bigger baggie. 
	
‚ÄúLook. There‚Äôs 16 bags in there. I‚Äôm a do you right if you keep bringing me money.‚Äù
	
‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I say.
	
‚ÄúTry to get 200 if you can. I‚Äôll give you 30 bags. So what ya think? Fire right?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúOh yeah. Just wanna see what it‚Äôs like when I shoot it.‚Äù
	
‚ÄúBags are ten a piece from me. My boys told me I need to be giving deals and get people working under me. It‚Äôs 14 for 100. 30 for 200. Like I said they‚Äôre ten a piece from me, but I bet you can get 15 or even 20 around here. Even at ten, though, you‚Äôre making a pretty stash for yourself. Hit me up. You got my number.‚Äù
	
‚ÄúAight. Sounds good, yo.‚Äù I clap my hands and rock forward in my seat. 
	
Before Sal gets out, he does that cocky thing where dudes throw their chin back at Beth. He asks her what she‚Äôs doing with the Junky Vonnegut. She looks at me frowning and shrugging.
	
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúYou never told her?‚Äù Sal asks.
	
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to tell her.‚Äù I say. 
	
‚ÄúNow there is. Tell me.‚Äù Beth says.
	
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. Stupid.‚Äù I say.
	
‚ÄúSo, when I was in rehab with this guy,‚Äù he points to me with his lips and his chin, ‚ÄúYour boy, here, he was always running around with this book in his hand.‚Äù
	
‚ÄúWhat book?‚Äù She asks.
	
‚ÄúWhat is it called, again?‚Äù Sal asks me.
	
‚ÄúBreakfast of Champions. The best book ever written.‚Äù I say plainly.
	
‚ÄúYeah, The Breakfast of Champions. Haha. This guy tells me he wants to be a writer and that he‚Äôs obsessed with the author of the book.‚Äù
	
Beth looks back and forth at us. She doesn‚Äôt get it. ‚ÄúSo?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúSo, the guy‚Äôs name is Vonnegut, right?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúYeah. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.‚Äù I say.
	
‚ÄúYeah. That. Anyway. I say to him, maybe you can‚Äôt be this guy but you can be like the Junky Vonnegut or something. Everyone called him the Junky Vonnegut that. He was so crazy. It took him three weeks to start wearing shoes.‚Äù Sal laughs. ‚ÄúYou never told her about that?‚Äù
	
‚ÄúNo.‚Äù 

Sal can‚Äôt understand why. He shakes his head and laughs some more. We bump knuckles. He tells Beth his name and asks for hers. Then, he opens the door, closes it and limps away.  I pull the stash out and take the rubber band off and hand one to Beth. She holds it up to her nose and inhales with her eyes closed. She moans. 

‚ÄúThe Junky Vonnegut, huh?‚Äù She rolls her eyes.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúStupid.‚Äù
	
‚ÄúI know. What I said. I don‚Äôt think he even gets that it‚Äôs an inside joke.‚Äù

She nods.

‚ÄúYou got works?‚Äù I ask.
	
‚ÄúNo.‚Äù She says. ‚ÄúI got a few bucks, though.‚Äù Beth gets out and jogs for the door closest to the pharmacy. The toddler looks at me and reaches out to give me a few soggy Goldfish.

Beth sings with the radio all the way back to her place. 	

	
Except for a few minutes when she parks outside of her sister‚Äôs place and takes the kid inside to leave with her for a few hours. There‚Äôs silence for a bit, but when she gets back in the car, Hotel California is playing. Beth sings the lyrics passionately and plays some air drums. She even does the guitar solos with her mouth. It‚Äôs pretty terrible, but she‚Äôs excited about the dope we got, and I kind of have myself to blame for her singing. I told her she was a good singer once. I can‚Äôt remember what song it was playing when I did, but it was sadder and softer and she had more control of her voice. Now, she blows notes that are flat and out of key at the top of her lungs and looks at me, wiggling her eyebrows and striking diva poses for a laugh. She thinks I like it. I smile back at her.
	
	
When we make it up the stairs to her apartment, she gets a glass of water and two spoons. I toss my pack of smokes onto the coffee table and the bag with the other baggies inside of it. I pull my sweatshirt and shirt over my head and toss it on the couch next to me.  Beth and I have never done drugs together. We know a lot of the same people, but our knowledge of each other is strictly chemical free.

 
Getting high with someone for the first time is a special thing. It‚Äôs like the first time a girl undresses for you with the lights on and you see the things you've never seen or that time your uptight math teacher with the crucifix and long skirts put on some jeans and cut up with the other teachers on a field trip to the local wildlife preserve, like it‚Äôs a different person altogether. And Beth delivers. It is every bit as intimate as making love.


We drop water onto the powder in our spoons. We suck it up into our syringes. She wears a stained white tank top and wipes the crook of her arm with an alcohol swab. Beth pulls the looped leather belt tight before she starts poking herself. There are already a few bruises and red specked freckles in the crook of her arm. The skin on mine only has the purple, leathery divot of old scar tissue. My vein is fat beneath that. The needle is sharp. A black blood flower blooms in my syringe and disappears. 


I swallow hard. She sighs with hard lungs right behind me. Then, we sit in silence, letting the tingle crush us, our arms and legs and shoulders and necks. I lean back on the couch and throw my hands up above my head. It‚Äôs hazy after that. We sleep. The womb of our goddess is warm. We are birthed back into the world, only to have her bear us once more in her belly. We slumber. We suckle at our mother‚Äôs bosom. She is all that we need. She is all that we want.

But I always lurk on this page whenever I've had no luck finding any pills to take.  It sometimes takes up time when my mind is wishing I could pop 20-30 mg of oxy for the night.  I always get so jealous of all the pictures of people flashing all these presc pills they just copped.  Where do most of you all get these from?  Off the street?  Dark net?

I‚Äôm gonna write about the most recent one. 

I was being really stupid, and don‚Äôt know why I did, but I decided it‚Äôd be a good idea to combine Oxycodone, Xanax, and Alcohol. 

(VERY DANGEROUS COMBO DO NOT EVER DO THIS) 

To start the day I had 3 1/2, 2mg Pharmaceutical xans, and 20mg of Oxycodone. I took 2mg Xanax when I woke up and went and bought 6, 24 oz steel reserves. I skated through my city, stumbling upon a church after awhile and snorting 5mg Oxy and popping the other half. 

I then kept skating towards the river, I got there and found a homeless camp and kinda just barged in. I asked if they smoked and we smoked some weed and I offered them a beer and gave em a couple bucks and snorted my other oxy. We drank a beer, I think I was on my second 24 oz at this point.

After this I was pretty fucked. I ate shit on my skateboard a handful of times and was bleeding all over. I think I popped another xan around this time, this is when it starts getting hazy. I was just going along the river and found a rope swing and being in the idiotic state I was in I thought it‚Äôd be a good idea so I took my shirt off and swung in a few times. I was soaking wet and broke my brand new phone. 

I let myself dry out while drinking another beer. At this point I was on 4mg Xanax, 20mg oxy, and 3, 24oz 8% beers.
It hadn‚Äôt really all kicked in yet so I managed to skate down to the skatepark and passed out somewhere in the grass. Someone found me after I don‚Äôt know how long and apparently couldn‚Äôt wake me at all, I eventually did wake up and was SOOOO groggy and fucked. I was slurring so hard I literally couldn‚Äôt form words or stand at all and they called an ambulance. I don‚Äôt remember this part at all from starting from when I got to the skatepark, I woke up in the hospital and there were 3 beers left and 1 xan that they took so I ended up taking 5mg Xanax along with lots of alcohol on top of opiates. I feel like I probably wasn‚Äôt THAT far from death. Especially because I could‚Äôve easily taken the last xan and drank more which might‚Äôve done it. This scared me for about 3 days but today I picked up some oxys so that‚Äôs out the window. Definently keeping my distance from benzos though and recommend everyone do the same. 

I guess the reason I‚Äôm writing this is because I just want to vent and share the story while I still somewhat remember it. And also want to warn others of this combo. It‚Äôs no joke. It wasn‚Äôt scary at the time because I was on Xanax but level of fucked up I was scares me. And I know I‚Äôm a dumbass.

Hydrocodone, its bioavailability is in the ~70% range.

According to equivalency charts of their potencies, they are compared at a 1:1 strength. 

My question about this:
*is 30mg of Oral Morphine equal to 30mg of Hydrocodone, for example?*

The reason I ask this is because I‚Äôve noticed a lot of people on our home here on r/opiates claim that ‚Äútaking oral morphine is a complete waste‚Äù, but I hear nothing similar about Hydrocodone. 

So the confusion sets in: Would 200mg of morphine taken orally, at its 30% bioavailability, be comparable to roughly 100mg of Hydrocodone taken orally? 

Or is more or so:
200mg of Morphine oral comparable to 200mg of Hydrocodone oral?

I still wifed her tho (5 min read with TL/DR).","Requested by u/lilymminx & a few others. 

Well, I met my (later to be) wife, through mutual friends (as you do) when I was 23 and was a fresh faced medical school graduate who was doing a rotation through the ER in the town I lived in then. This is part of the process to becoming a doctor who is able to practice with full (not provisional) registration. 

So we were going steady after a few months, things were going well for me at work, the stress of medical school was behind me, I had clear road ahead & was really enjoying plying my trade and putting into practice what I had learned at uni. 

In hindsight, there were red flags pretty much from day one. Things I should‚Äôve seen but didn‚Äôt, feelings I had but ignored. 

Things such as after our first proper date, I drove her home, and after I‚Äôd seen her inside and stolen a kiss, got back in my car and couldn‚Äôt find my bottle of dexamfetamine. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it, but I *always* carry it with me everywhere I go. Have done since a kid. I knew I had it at dinner, but figured it fell out of my pocket. 

After a few months, we moved in together. It‚Äôs kinda hard to keep things seperate when you share a bed and a bathroom, and she did ask if she could have a few of my pills and while I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúsure‚Äù it was a ‚Äúturn a blind eye thing‚Äù so, she went to fucking town.

Now I should say at this point (we‚Äôll never meet and this is all anonymous) that Louise has Borderline Personality Disorder AND Bipolar 2. So that‚Äôs where the insane outbursts, idealisation, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do anything for you as long as you love me, but if you try to leave, I‚Äôll kill you‚Äù & lack of impulse control and a desire to ‚Äúdull the pain‚Äù comes in. And after 6 months, yeah I did love her. 

We were building a life together nothing could go wrong! 

*Narrator* ‚Äúin fact soon, *everything* would go wrong‚Äù

So being a doc, I kept a prescription pad at home, and you know, I was practicing at a hospital. Fuck did I need a prescription pad for? It‚Äôs all done on the hospital computers & special hospital prescription pads in the ER. 

So I thought my pad would be safer in my bedside table, I mean after all, who the fuck is gonna get to it there?

Apparently, Louise (not her real name btw). 

I didn‚Äôt realise this until MUCH later in our relationship but poor Louise had substance abuse issues (as many with Borderline Personality Disorder do) and had been in rehab once or twice (4 actually) times. Her parents are wealthy and they paid for the best, but it never took. 

Anyway, it turned out that she had snuck a few of my prescriptions out of my pad, to see if I‚Äôd notice. I mean fuck, those things have a hundred pages, I never looked at it because I never used it and even if I did, who‚Äôd notice? 

So the crafty minx has been practicing my signature over a few months (something that would save my bacon later) and by this stage she was pretty good at it. So she started writing prescriptions for her DOC‚Äôs (opioids and benzos). 

She started off small with scripts for morphine that certainly seemed reasonable. Had greed not gotten the better of her, perhaps no one would‚Äôve ever found out. 

A few times I came home from work to find her fucked up. And I mean completely, totally out of it. I walk in ‚Äúhoney I‚Äôm home‚Äù and she‚Äôs on the bed, drooling, unrousable and snoring like a hog. 

Of course, I go into full fucking doctor mode, checking her vitals, etc, and come to the conclusion an ambulance isn‚Äôt necessary. So I stay up all night with her (where are nurses for 15 minute obs when you need ‚Äòem?) Next morning she says she got some Xanax off her friend and obviously took too many (no shit). 

I told her not to do shit like that again and that was the end of it. 

Few more instances like that, each time ‚Äúit won‚Äôt happen again‚Äù. It annoyed me, but it wasn‚Äôt every fucking day and we were hot for each other and talking marriage. You know, you‚Äôre young, in love, you overlook a lot of shit. 

One day I get a call from (we have a new body now called AHPRA that deals with a lot of this stuff, but we still have our colleges etc) the Medical Council along the lines of ‚ÄúHey Dr Platinum_Tower, would you be able to come and see us on this date at this address for a chat?‚Äù 

Sure I say, thinking this is about my provisional registration or something. Perfectly normal thinks I. No complaints from the hospital, all my feedback (well the majority) was good, I‚Äôd grown professionally & considerably in my skills. 

So, I rock up in my suit, for a friendly chat and I noticed the mood was distinctly frosty ‚Äúthat‚Äôs odd‚Äù I thought, but took a seat. 

Then I was asked if I knew why I was there? No siree bob says I. 

Then they laid out about 50 scripts. ‚ÄúRecognise these?‚Äù have a quick look, ummm not really, then I look at the prescribing doctor. Yup Dr Platinum_Tower with what looks like a good facsimile of my signature, not perfect, but pretty damn close. 

My heart sank. But I actually thought (naievely that someone I‚Äôd maybe treated at hospital had gotten my name and stolen a script pad and I was just the unfortunate doc they picked).

Then I realised ‚Äúhow would they know my signature?‚Äù (my REAL signature, not the scribble I use in professional settings). 

Then I thought, who would have access to a prescription pad and know my signat....ohh shit. 

Now the thing is, a blank prescription pad on its own isn‚Äôt particularly useful, sure you can write shit on there, but you have to know the conventions and rules (such as scripts for heavily controlled we call em Schedule 8) scripts can only have ONE item per script. You can‚Äôt have ‚ÄúMorphine AND Oxycodone‚Äù on one script, or its invalid. If you need to write both, you gotta do two seperate scripts. 

Also unless you know the prescriber number etc, it‚Äôs not much use to you. Obviously, being my fucking gf/fianc√©e at the time, she knew ALL my professional credentials & what to write (prescriber number etc not medical abbreviations etc). 

My heart sank and I thought I was gonna vomit. I cast my mind over the scripts a bit closer. OxyContin 80mg, Morphine 100mg, Fentanyl patches, Xanax 2mg, Lorazepam 2.5mg, Temazepam, Flunitrazepam, Diazepam, if there was a benzo I could‚Äôve scripted, Louise scripted it. 

The amazing thing (I mean truly mind boggling) was that she had been obtaining prescriptions (in her name) for INJECTABLE forms of opioids. Some fucking pharmacist filled injectable opioids outside a hospital pharmacy setting!  

I mean *they* should be struck off for that, that‚Äôs so far out there, I can‚Äôt imagine how they thought that was legit. Given it was probably written with a kindergarten level of medical knowledge and zero understanding of medical terms. 

I can‚Äôt imagine a script for something like ‚ÄúKetamine (the big doses) as needed through needle‚Äù or whatever the fuck Louise put on it sailing through unquestioned, but there you have it. 

Not for use by a doctor, but for self administration. I mean, Morphine Sulfate, (she managed a script for Ketamine which she said was for a friend) and drugs that have NO place outside a hospital. 

I was really worried about the IV stuff, but she assured me they were for friends who knew what she was doing. I to this day believe her (15 years later & older and wiser).  

The working assumption was that I had been prescribing them to a woman / women I was fucking in exchange for sex or cash. 

I pretty quickly realised what had gone on and had to explain everything. We were living together, we‚Äôre gonna get married she has BPD. 

It apparently isn‚Äôt unheard of for family members to steal a script, but this was unprecedented. Louises eventual undoing was presenting a script twice at the same chemist, a couple of days apart, with different names, to the same pharmacist, and both scripts had medical errors on them (and were for frankly outrageous quantities if memory serves). 

She wasn‚Äôt familiar with certain terms, and the pharmacist got suss, called the line to report dodge scripts and then ALL of the scripts ‚ÄúI‚Äù had written came out. 

She needed to give a statutory declaration that I wasn‚Äôt involved, I was given a damn good talking too and it was (thank you Baby Jesus) decided it would be handled administratively with our State Government health authorities with remedial training for me about ‚Äúprescription pad safety‚Äù or some shit. 

Believe it or not, most health agencies DON‚ÄôT want to see doctors deregistered for mistakes or even borderline criminal conduct, they spend a lot of time training us and want us to be around for 50+ years. Plus there‚Äôs always a doctor shortage. 

I got my full registration (obviously) and no police involvement was deemed necessary (thank fuck this was in the days we could keep shit totally in house if we felt like it in medical boards and state health authorities). 

It was made clear to me that it was (basically) because we were getting married. I‚Äôm under no illusions if it was just some chick I was banging, she would‚Äôve been practically frogmarched into a police station. 

She was able to keep the scripts ‚Äúbelow the PBS government radar‚Äù because she was writing the scripts as ‚Äúprivate prescriptions‚Äù. This means the government doesn‚Äôt subsidise the medication, so you have to pay full price for the script, but no one in government knows about it. 

I also found out I was paying for them too as we had a joint account at the time this was going on and she was taking money out for ‚Äúexpenses‚Äù and using that to pay for the scripts. 

Apparently she was providing he majority to friends who roped her into writing for them. She was taking a fair amount herself. No wonder her friends were all super nice to me (I thought it was coz I was a nice guy)

Not my finest hour. 

I‚Äôll answer any questions you guys may have. 

TL/DR Girlfriend/fianc√©e (who has BPD & Bipolar) at time stole my prescription pad wrote herself & her friends benzos and opioids (plus shit that really shouldn‚Äôt be seen outside a hospital setting) got caught out and put me in a very precarious position which I managed to wiggle out of (thank Christ). I still married her tho. 2 kids and 15 years later, hasn‚Äôt been a repeat. ",1537437929.0

I was parked on red smoking in my car. Although ive smoked in the same spot hundreds of times, its a low key spot in a nice suburb, everyone minds their business.

Im watching netflix on my phone while I smoke and I look up to my left to see a cop on a motorcycle. Fuck. I was caught red handed as fuck so there was nothing i could do. He tells me to roll down my window. He gives me this look like are you serious man? 

I ask him to please show me mercy. He was like are you joking? He asks for my ID. I say please I dont want my life to be ruined over me being an idiot.

He goes youre ruining your own life. He asks who i live with. I say my mother. He asks about my dad. I say hes been out of the picture for a long time and that its just me and my mother and ive taken care if her for a long time.

He tells me to call her on the phone and put it on speaker. He takes my phone and walks away and tells her whats going on. I cant hear what he saying. He tells her hes just going to give me a ticket for parking on red. I guess he decided to actually show me mercy. He hangs up and takes a picture of my tar and the straw and clips i was using to smoke it, all of which he had me place on the roof of my car.

He gives me a little mini lecture and asks if i have any questions. I say no and thank him and tell him to go ahead and write the ticket and ill be on my way. He hands me back my license and tells me to drive off and let the wind take care of my shit. In other words, he didnt give me a ticket and told me to drive off with my drugs still on the roof of my car. The street i turned on is a busy one so anything that would fall of would be run over.

I drive off, turn onto the first street and check to see if my stuff is on my car. My clips and straw were still there but my gram of tar was gone. I grab my stuff and pocket it. It had about a .25 still on it. I call my mom and tell her everything is ok and that im coming home. Not before i call my hook and get another gram. I thought of going back and searching for my lost gram but figured i wouldnt press my luck. All in all it cost me a $70 gram of heroin and infinite shame. 

Ive been trying to quit and this is the straw that broke the camels back, so it was for the best. Fuck everything and everyone. Fuck heroin, it doesnt even get me high anymore. 

As far as my mother.. she had suspicions that ive been doing drugs. I told her that this was a good thing because it gave me the jolt i needed without fucking up my life. Now she can even help me detox too instead of my trying to hide a fucking detox from her.

I have no regrets. Ive learned a lot from this journey but the journey must come to an end for it to have meaning. ""There comes a time when you have to turn your back on that nonsense and just say no.""

I had no connects left though so to Craigslist I went. After a few conversations I found a guy in my area and went through the usual process proving your not LE. In that process we noticed many mutual friends on social media. After we met up everything was chill and we realized we went to middle school together like 8‚Äî10 years ago. 


    But to the compassionate part, usually around here dealers like that won‚Äôt sell anything less than 40 but I‚Äôve been trying to stay as sober as possible so I don‚Äôt spiral back into addiction faster than necessary. But he was willing to sell me a dub. After that we started talking about life and just everything and I thanked him for being one of the few to sell small sacks and how that helped me not fuck up my life as much with this stuff. 


         So after hearing my whole story, he right away just says,‚Äù we all people out here sometime people forget that, and I know sometimes people just new help from others sometimes‚Äù and proceeds to say that if you‚Äôre trying to quit than dubs aren‚Äôt the way to go. So he says he would sell me 15s to 10s to 5s to even 2 sacks if I really want to taper down and quit or just want a little to get high without having to get a whole half gram to use up and fall completely back into full addiction


       I don‚Äôt know I just got some great vibes from basically a stranger that they truly wanted to just do whatever would be best and make me happiest regardless of the money involved. It‚Äôs such a rare occurrence for me to feel like the dealer actually wants what‚Äôs best for his customer and reminds me theres good in the world even in its darkest corners.

And she was the plug's girl.

Fuckkk man. I had the plug's sexy plump little ass, mini italian looking face, beautiful little belly... In my room. Off limits. Even she knew it.





While she timidly walked inside smiling with wild difficult to contain excitement and the sweet feel of freedom from his bondage.





But even me.... on heroin, and having one small tool of protection, I still *thought* I was top dog and could handle anything that came my way and I was always so obsessed every time I saw her.... But then..

I noticed her piercing gaze that would dissect my innermost vibes with the first question I ever asked her the first time we were alone together in that room, five minutes walking from where the team of Florida narcotics force had found the 10 oz of raw dope.








Nikki said ""You know, you're eventually gonna probably get shot over this.""


I smiled, paused. Our eyes burning to know how this vibe between us could even possibly have ignited so fast.

""You're right, can I just see how you'd fit me?"" I replied. I laid down and motioned for her to come be the little spoon. 

""What!!?? You're fucking crazy!!"" She said fighting back every desire. Every lustful wish.

Every fear.

Every wall.








And she jumped into that bed with me and fit so perfect against me I got hard instantly and she spun around for eyes to meet.

""How the fuck is this happening?""

I was thinking the same thing. About her eyes. Instantly she knew I had always wanted her truly. Instantly we were in love regardless of whether or not we wanted to be. She just knew my most innermost vibes.

She knew right there she would be doing nothing but trying to fucking repopulate the Earth with me by breaking several ""records"" if you guys (and girls) know what I mean. 

And now I got all these hoes man.



And I don't want any of them. I want my bear cub back. ""Come come"" she'd say in the sweetest doped out little baby voice to me. ""I saw how you looked at the store clerk."" She was possessive of me. But i loved it. She loved me. And i loved her.


So. 


Fucking.


Much.

OK friends, now that that is out of the way.. let me get right to the point-  with opiates and the lifestyle in general, many people lose touch, either IRL or in our little(?) reddit community.    If you have anyone on your mind [from around here] that you haven't seen in a while, you should comment their username and if you know the whereabouts of any user posted..you should reply and update us.

Definitely don't want to hear about anyone's personal business or any gossip or speculation.., so keep that in mind.  I also hope you understand that this idea is coming from a place of concern.  there are some amazing souls around here.

I'll kick this off by naming two but I have to do it in the comments in order for a page.     Good luck, be kind to each other, and stay safe.

For example I took it earlier today (20mg IR) and I‚Äôm feeling pretty depressed, back in bed listening to music I haven‚Äôt touched in weeks, with the ability to cry (something I absolutely can‚Äôt do sober anymore since the age 12-13, until I learn that sober skill again).

It always gives me this calm headspace yet focused but it‚Äôs almost sedating almost always for me. I tried abusing it once (taking 20mg tablets throughout the night with a buddy 1-2 at a time ever hour, not a smoker but I sure smoked over 15+ cigs that night) and I felt absolutely guilty and disgusting (even though I just talked small talk all night) as the ‚Äúbinge‚Äù ended 2pm and I was up for almost 2 days, first day didn‚Äôt abuse, couldn‚Äôt sleep and the second day without sleep I decided to wanna feel what everyone loved about it. Not even at the 160mg range mark after all that night..

Anyways, yeah it‚Äôs making me feel depressed, mentally focused slightly but sedated in a weird way hard to describe.. other times I‚Äôve gotten productive, hungry.

But the main point is I noticed, depending on *my* mood, Adderall amplifies how I feel inside in a sense.
Doesn‚Äôt feel no where near MDMA except for this openness trait on my mood.

I am a little worried about a locum GP (any brother Brits on here will know what I mean!) who prescribed me 7.5mg zopiclone to help ease some crippling insomnia. S/he didn't radiate confidence and I've had a serious incident with a clueless GP last year - the GP doubled my azathioprine dose for five days to help with an Crohn's mini-flare. Turns out it was a severely toxic dose and was the final bullet that killed my thyroid. Hence why I'd feel much better with some amateur-experts opinions!

I'm on 10mg Subutex a day and currently no other narcotics or first generation sedative anti-histamines. Long story short I was on a cocktail of codeine, long release dihydrocodeine, cyclizine (a great booster, but legitimately the only anti-emetic that worked to stop 15-20 vomiting sessions a day) and liquid morphine to deal with several bad bowel blockages that led to two major resections in 7 months.

I was told as long as I took only one 7.5mg a night for a couple of days there should be no problem with the buprenorphine combo due to it's ceiling for respiratory depression, and that I'm already above it.

Anyone with personal experience, or with a well rounded knowledge agree with that? Bloody comes to something when the users are better placed than a doctor!

Just out of interest (and my addictive personality needing to know!) would codeine/zopiclone cause problems due to the lack of respiratory ceiling?

9h1fv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9h1fv2/i_think_im_done/,34,https://redd.it/9h1fv2,iwanttomakesense,I think I'm done,"I've been on oxycodone and morphine for almost two years now. I have a connective tissue disorder and the only way that I can describe it is that I just hurt all the time. On a good day it feels like I had my ass kicked two days ago. On a bad day it feels like there's acid in my shoulder blades or hot needles in my back. Sometimes I get headaches that last for days where I lose most of my vision and puke uncontrollably. It drove me crazy. I lost my wife, my job, my kids. I tried to kill myself several times.

Then after years of negative experiences with health care specialists, I finally found a doctor that listened to me. We tried a few different drugs before settling on oxycodone. Then we added morphine on top. For the most part the meds helped with the baseline pain, we never could get the headaches under control though and they got progressively worse, especially this summer. I lost my job again. Got a new, better paying one right after and couldn't make it through the first night shift as my back was spasming and had to leave the shop several times to throw up. Lost that one too. Almost immediately.

I had also been seeing a doctor at a pain clinic who would give me nerve block injections sometimes up to fifty injections all along my back, neck, head and face. They don't help, they just make me uncomfortably numb for a few hours at most until my symptoms return but I do it anyways because it looks better on paper that as someone taking opioids, I am also seeking other avenues of treatment.

He recently left and I was switched to a new doctor who on our third visit suggested we 'give effexor a try and see how that works out' and told me I was a drug seeker when I informed him that no, I had been on effexor when I was younger for depression and I did not want to go back to that for a multitude of reasons. He told me that I was a drug seeker and typed a lot of what I imagine were some pretty negative things to my primary physician through the medical portal that they use to communicate with each other. I tried not to think about it and sat there as he silently injected me with local anesthetic after his sanctimonious diatribe.

When I went to refill my script, I didn't realize it at the time but my prescription had been cut in half without any warning from my doctor. I didn't notice because the script had been written for a month this time - I normally have to request a refill every two weeks so the amount was still technically the same as always in terms of both amount and cost. The pharmacist, who has always  treated me like a junkie from the moment I filled my first script, didn't even bother to mention the change. Had I have to thought to read the label I would have seen the ""DOSE REDUCED"" but such is life.

My head had been pretty brutal for most of August and the first part of September so naturally I ran out earlier than expected... Even earlier than usual. When I finally did look at the bottle to double check when my next refill was due, I noticed the dose had been changed. After the interaction with the 'pain specialist' I can only assume that this was meant to be a taper off. My doctor has never expressed any desire to lower my dose in the past and the fact that she did it without explaining why does not look good at all.

The last week has been hell to say the least  and I still have to wait two more to find out what the hell is going on but the situation looks pretty grim. My symptoms are back in full force most days and the withdrawals on top of that just about killed me and tbh I genuinely wanted to die. But now I'm feeling better in a really, really fucking wierd way.

I recently started therapy, which the old me would have never done but I genuinely wanted to work on my mental health even before I knew I was likely losing my meds. Withdrawing during the first session was probably one of the worst experiences of my life. At the same time though, it was an amazingly gratifying situation. The WD's had made me so vulnerable that I was unable to keep my normal facade up and I actually just talked. And kept talking. I'm not proud to say but I had to hold back tears for alot of it. It was the perfect storm, I was like a therapists wet dream. For the first time in my life I was actively addressing the problems in my life instead of desperately trying to avoid them.

While the WD's are gone for the most part. I don't think the cravings will ever really go away but I hope eventually they'll start to subside. I've been using the short amount of  time that I've been 'clean' and in therapy to think about the road ahead, and I have two options at this point. One being heroin, as pills are hard to come by in my neck of the woods and the small amount that I had access to for times like these are no longer available. And two, accept my fate and try to be as positive as I can about it. Deal with the pain and do my best to be happy and show those that are important to me how much I care about them instead of never texting or calling anybody back, never leaving the house except for work/ visits my kids, or nodding myself to sleep every fucking night because I can't handle the physical or mental pain that never ever seems to go away. And the fucked up thing is, I think I'm gonna go with option two.

Being without oxy has taken away my ability to shut off my brain when the demons want to hang out and I've had to face them head on. No more numbing myself because I miss my wife or kids. You miss them? Find a way to get them back, you fuck. No more passing out on the floor because I hate what my disorder has turned me into. You're in pain? Find a less physical job, dumbass. Stop hurting yourself for money, there are other options. No more getting fucked up because mom didn't love me growing up and won't talk to me as an adult. I just gotta deal with it. 

I'm still scared as shit about the headaches that I get because they seem to strike randomly and can last anywhere from an evening to a fortnight but you can't win em all, I guess. Then again they are a beast that even oxy couldn't tame so it's something I'm just gonna have to learn to live with.

I didn't really talk to any of you but I followed some of your stories pretty closely to the point that I felt like I knew you. I related to alot of the chaos in a lot of your lives. And I just want to say that I love you guys. Especially Metro so if you guys could do me a solid maybe stop downvoting his fucking wowzies? They were how I knew a post was fire and now I hardly see them anymore. FLJ, you seemed like a fucking character, congrats on the new mod position. Chasingd0pamine gets an honourable mention and of course Tracey. Tracey, you're doing the Lord's work. Pretty sure I read that you were feeling burnt out recently and I hope that you're doing better.

Thanks to the people that answered my dumb questions when I was confused about things like cold water extraction, and thanks to the people that answered the even dumber questions that I would ask on my burner accounts. My personal favourites were the ones where I thought I was dying because of certain drug cocktails that should never be taken but are also just too much fucking fun not to.

Everybody be safe out there, from my brothers and sisters on the needle to those of us who loved our pills just a little too much and everybody in between. Nod for me guys because I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to for a long, long time. If I ever do again.

9gzx6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9gzx6h/a_tip_for_my_fellow_iv_users/,9,https://redd.it/9gzx6h,DamiensLust,A tip for my fellow I.V. users,"Hello!

Just earlier today I was totally DESPAIRING. A good shot of crack and heroin loaded up, I was sick as fuck, and could not find a vein anywhere. I've used up all my good sites - crook, arms, hand, wrists, feet, even my shoulders and around my biceps. For the last few weeks I've been thinking that I'm going to have to go neck or groin since it was getting SO difficult to hit a vein, and often when I did hit a vein trying to inject would cause searing pain and a weird red mark. Not a miss, but apparently the veins are obstructed, so even if I hit some blood and dont move the needle a millimeter it will still not be a hit. In desperation today, I tried somewhere new.

This may be common knowledge to you, but I decided to try the back side of my arm, the spot thats usually really awkward and difficult to hit because of the angle. That is until today when I realised that I could turn the needle so that I was injecting against the flow of blood - *away* from the heart - and still hit the vein perfectly fine! 

This has opened up a whole new area for me of really good veins that are giving that big purple gush of blood and its fucking awesome! I know they won't last forever, but I'm rotating my sites since for the first time since I started using this has opened up a whole new bunch of great veins at once, and I'm going to try and make them last. I didn't ever hit them before because if you try to put the needle in the right position i.e. with the flow of blood, they become unhittable as they are at a weird angle, but I have had three shots today and put the needle in the ""wrong"" way and have had zero problems. I know it's probably not ideal to go against the flow but it sure beats starting to use my groin or missing. 

Thought I'd post this in case there were any fellow junkies out there like me who didn't realise these veins could be hit by going against the flow. There is nothing worse than being sick and having the cure in your hand and not being able to get it into your body, so if this helps one fellow junkie then I be pleased.

Hope Junkie Jesus smiles on you all as he has guided my needle today! :) ",1537313100.0

It‚Äôs hard to fathom that he thought he‚Äôd become a heroin addiction (IV). I‚Äôm 99% sure he doesn‚Äôt bother to carry Narcan.,"Is there any possibility that my brother is happy?  I move him so much. We used to be so close. Or perhaps as close as he COULD be to a human?

I meant to say it‚Äôs hard to fathom that he would develop a severe heroin addiction. It happens so ok. But he put no attempts to slow the progression down, at all. He was able to do that with drinking and he‚Äôs a severe alcoholic. 

He heavily abused drugs and alcohol since he was a teen, heavily. A lot of it stems from a severe, unloving upbringing.  I was no angel, but he is the most reckless person I know.   I‚Äôm not judging ....just the way he was (is)?

He also betrays everyone, including me, but I‚Äôm not really mad. I know it‚Äôs up to him to choose kicking H - I don‚Äôt see it happening. I wish my intuition was wrong.  He lies so much. Even senseless lies. 

He changed and is it a personality change from withdrawal or long term drug and alcohol use?  I‚Äôm a recovered alcoholic and I‚Äôm lucky my liver is OK. 

He had a lot of aspirations‚Äî-he never cared for work but his college degree was so important to him. He dropped out senior year.  

His favorite author was at a local store today - signing books. It was a surprise!  It wasn‚Äôt Stephen King...but that popular. He would have been excited and I would have bought us both books to sign. Now, I bet he wouldn‚Äôt care.  

He‚Äôs handsome. Or was. His looks are GONE. He was a good dresser, too. A bit of vanity but he carried himself well. He looks like he was thrown in a ditch, face first.

I have a couple of other questions - but is he maybe satisfied with his life?  I want happiness for him. Saw him a few years ago, he‚Äôd OD‚Äôd and aspirated and I legally make medical decisions if he can‚Äôt consent. So much pain. 

I‚Äôm scared of him now. Especially ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù  Lots of B &amp;amp; E, including family. But true B&amp;amp; E plus knicking stuff to pawn during the day. 

He screws over everyone. Everyone. He got in the scene as an enforcer and I heard he‚Äôs been greenlit. He stole a bunch if opiates from the main dealer.  

Oh. He doesn‚Äôt work a regular job. So he‚Äôs scraping together money daily by whatever means. 

I need to quit worrying.  I can‚Äôt let go. Yet maybe it was all a lie. I freely gave him money thinking he was clean.  

He gave me company and safety when I left my marriage. I knew I‚Äôd given him 60k over a year and just as a gift....but I didn‚Äôt say steal. Just ask. 

He was homeless, too, so he needed a place to stay for free. I bet he is homeless a lot yet I cannot imagine. 

But what if he died?  Will he die happy?  I miss that f@cker but I do NOT trust him. ",1537311498.0

Last year I managed to drag myself into treatment for 30 days after getting hooked on opiates for 3 nasty years. I started in college just like anyone else, oxys and whatnot. After a few years of barely scraping by I was about to fail out of school and was very reliant on heroin to get through my days. I couldnt take it anymore and my family couldnt either. I went to treatment last January. It was awesome actually I learned a lot and reopened my eyes to life. However, I didn't take anyones advice and stuck with suboxone. After treatment I managed to get a job I love working outside at a Garden Center. Right before the fall I was accepted by financial aid to finish my last semester at college and get my degree. Everything in me wanted to get off the suboxone before I started school. I was on 16mg a day so I started halfway through the summer. I got myself down to 1mg a day of suboxone. With a month before school, it hit me. I got high again. It's like I was living in a different reality because of the suboxone. Off and on, I've gotten right back to where I was. Instead of getting help or detoxing before school, I manned up and said I got this. Well it's a few weeks into the semester and I definitely don't got this. In fact I had to move home again, and my life has really affected my folks. My mom can't handle it anymore. She ended up figuring a lot out that I would never have included her in on (for the sake of her sanity), but she figured it out. At this point I just can't believe I got back to this point. I can't focus. I can't retain information. I'm usually a smart guy, but I've been reduced down to a t.v. watching dumbass who manages to go to work for 16 hours a week. I'm sad guys. I'm calling the treatment place I went to last year and I'm going tomorrow. The hardest part for me right now is how I'm going to get the University to understand I've fucked up once again, and how I'm going to tell my job that I'm going to be gone. The job is lowpaying and just some job, but I love the people like family. Guess I just needed to get this all out there since I havent been able to talk about it much.  
Thanks for reading guys wish me luck

TLDR;

Online it says that drug tests testing for opiates don't test for bupe because the drug tests for opiates check for a metabolite found in meth/heroin/prescription opiates like oxy but that metabolite is not found in bupe (my guess is because it's a pseudo)

i knew my roommate back in highschool, i guess id say we were friends but barely above the level of acquaintance friends though. anyway i definitely should have told him that i had already relapsed when he moved in, i did tell him i was in recovery but not much detail. anyway i tried to keep it secret in the beginning but with my terrible memory, my formerly not having a roommate for a good while therefore i got used leaving shit in the open and stuff, and i also vastly underestimated the level of pissed he would be about drugs and messes in general. 

&#x200B;

now i know im in the wrong, and hes right he shouldnt have to deal with it, but at the same time i own part of this house and hes a renter so its weird for him to constantly act like he's the boss instead of just moving out if he really hates it here. is that fucked up of me to think that way? at first whenever he'd find a needle, or see some blood in the sink i was very apologetic, i tend to have a bad memory as it is so when i get really messed up and start nodding and shit and i wont realize i made a mess. eventually he kept hounding me for every single little thing that i found it hard to keep caring i got sick of it, dude would be late with the rent multiple times and avoid talking about that but didnt mind complaining about me taking the cans in for recycling when they are 90% his cans lol. and its like, blood on the wall, completely understand the complaint, one little cotton on the bathroom counter or a needle cap under a table maybe those dont need to be a fight.

&#x200B;

The point of maintenance therapy should be offering you a safe alternative to street drugs and the hustle and crime, period. Adding tons of catches and strings and red tape only drives people back to the street and now their tolerance is lower and DEAD! Bravo medical pros!  The only real reason to kick someone off is if they are not taking their meds and obvious financially diverting them, period. No one should be kicked off for pee tests coming back for other drugs, what the hell kind of sense does that make? Well we see here you are struggling, so get the fuck out and go back to your street H! What is this a jealous GF? You'd think a med pro would say hey it seems you are struggling, does your dose need increasing?

It seems like sometimes the rationale for the strict rules and zero tolerance is to get only those who are committed to quitting and are willing to show effort but I feel this is wrong. If it was seen more as government competing against the illicit market for those dependent, think of how much market share they could take away and lives back on track or even saved.

Surprisingly Canada and Britain and Australia and a lot of Europe is surprisingly backwards, even for subs they make you dose essentially like methadone. Have to come in every day to a pharmacy, dose in front of the disgusted pharmacist who hates dealing with this crap daily wasting his time. Sometimes at a special addicts counter or area, yea sounds great!

It turns out when you load up on a big supply of opiates without having ANY tolerance, it's pretty easy to just nod the FUCK out.

Oh well. Supply wise I've just been chilling on a massive supply of weed, usually with a bit of opium sprinkled into the joints, some dihydrocodeine and alazopram (courtesy of the pharmacy, no less!), as well as some nice strong heroin (just sniffing, no needles; no need)

It was a pretty weird feeling to walk into the pharmacy and ask for these super tightly controlled drugs and have the actual pharmacists just be like ""yeah, got you bro""

I could use some of your advice on what constitute great recreational pharmaceuticals, specifically opiates.
When I went yesterday, I just wrote down on a list- ""Vicoden, Alazopram, Codeine, Dilaudid, Fentynol"" and asked the pharmacists if they had any of those. They seemed to recognize the Fend and Vicoden but didn't have any in stock. I only checked two pharmacies because I have a serious lack of knowledge about prescriptions. I'm definitely gonna hit the pharmacies again and get more/better goodies.

The way the restaurants advertise and cook with weed here is fucking dope. The first day I got an extra extra strength ""happy pizza"" which knocked me on my fucking ass, and then yesterday I got the strongest possible ""happy milkshake"". Dude, it's like a big ole delicious milkshake that would be super delicious without any drugs (which you can't even taste) and it's only a couple bucks.

Two big upcoming missions: tomorrow I'm going to relocate from a hotel to an Airbnb. That's gonna mean I'll have a whole goddamn apartment to myself, full kitchen, living room, etc... AND this place has a motherfucking outdoor jacuzzi on a balcony with a direct view of the river! I'm gonna spend so much time chillin on that balcony getting fucked up, what a dream vacation.

The second big mission is renting a motorbike, 125 cc is all a man needs - and it's less than 5 dollars a day I believe. Total freedom: might actually end up taking a roadtrip to some other nearby countries, but who knows; everything is so chill here that it's pretty hard to leave!

I didn't like standing there for 10+ min turning the microwave on and off, over and over.  We DO NOT want the cup to runneth over!  

So, I got to thinking about something I could do to eliminate the foamy bubbly bullshit.  I remembered my high-school days of funneling beers, and using my finger to rub the side of my nose and putting the finger with the nose grease on it into the beer foam, in the funnel.  This dissolved the foam, so to speak.  Then I had an idea! 

So, I put 1 drop of cooking oil (any type will work) into my OP+coke solution, screwed the lid onto my Magic Bullet (the food processor not the sex toy) cup and began microwaving it.  Yes!  The bubbles only went halfway up the cup and stayed there, and I was able to just let it cook!  Within 4 min my OP pieces were clear and no foamy bubbles leaked out of the lid! :)",1537247587.0

No matter where we are in the world. They literally have zero clue about formulating drug policy. 

We (an Australian state) recently hosted the DEFQON 1 music festival. I‚Äôm not familiar with the specific sub culture, who attends etc, however there were apparently a rash of drug overdoses and the place was awash with drugs (keeping the cops very busy). 

Dozens of people in hospital. Two young people tragically passed away. 

The Premier (elected head of government in the state & member of parliament) is talking about cancelling the festival, disallowing similar events & is convening an ‚Äúexpert panel‚Äù to report on what can be done. 

The irony here is that we literally have government run HEROIN INJECTING ROOMS that supply free injecting supplies and medical staff on site with free Naloxone, alcohol swabs, syringes et al for all! 

Pill testing is being advocated by the vast majority of the community in an effort to facilitate harm minimisation. Yet with their monolithic and blimp mentality, the government is simply saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do drugs. 

They‚Äôre illegal and you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in them‚Äù. NO SHIT that‚Äôs why we need pill testing so our kids don‚Äôt fucking die! 

Still promoting abstinence. Still talking about the tragedy of losing young lives, yet they won‚Äôt permit simple measures that can help save those young lives that they‚Äôre allegedly so concerned about. 

You can literally cross a border here and the next state over actually provides government funded pill testing. No drug overdoses there! 

The press gallery are thankfully excoriating the government in a live press conference, but I just wanted a rant about how fucked up drug prohibition and policy is. 

A member of the fourth estate, asked a particularly incisive question:

 ‚Äúif people are overdosing on drugs, because they are illegal and thus made in suboptimal conditions, by criminals, with unknown and dangerous chemicals, and it‚Äôs those chemicals that are causing the deaths of our young people, why would you be opposed to testing that could inform their choice of whether to take it or not?‚Äù (paraphrasing).

Premier stammering and going red in the face ‚Äúdrugs are illegal so don‚Äôt take them‚Äù. 

Great job Gladys (yes our premiers name is Gladys).

Fuck me I hate politicians. They‚Äôre as thick as two short planks. They purport to represent the people, yet when the people say ‚Äúwe want decriminalised drugs and pill testing‚Äù they‚Äôd rather young people die. 

It‚Äôs frankly disgusting.

What do you guys think, if someone (yes, me actually) uses opiates for a year, first like, once a month or so, and then for the next 8 months, at least every week or two weeks, that eventually, they'll be in physical withdrawal? I do know I'm deep in the psychological addiction, which is why when I use it's generally 2-3 day binges, but yeah, last time I did that, which was 4 days ago, seems to have taken some interesting toll on me. And by interesting, I mean fucking horrific.

I mean, I'm probably not gonna list all the symptoms cause I don't wanna be that guy who writes paragraphs about every little thing they feel, but like, I couldn't sleep for shit yesterday because I felt fucking horrible, not too much in specific except breathlessness for no reason, I just felt shitty. And then today I was havin a fun little walk on my way to cop some shit (unfortunately, my dealer flaked), when out of now where I had to shit like mad and yeah, now I'm nauseous as fuck and I couldn't even finish a bloody MUFFIN. And then I was convinced I'm dying because that's literally what everything in my body was telling me. It's not that bad now but yeah, again, skin on fucking fire.

It was basically like a fever, except I had no fever, and the ""fever"" was on meth and the power of Satan. Seriously, I have like all the withdrawal symptoms, is this even possible?

S5E9/10.,"**EDIT: SPOILERS AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN THIS FAR IN THE SERIES. FORGOT TO TAG THE TITLE THAT'S MY BAD. REPEAT, SPOILERS FOR THE NETFLIX ORIGINAL SHOW BOJACK HORSEMAN ARE IN THIS POST. IF YOU ARE NOT CAUGHT UP TO S5E10, TURN BACK NOW. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.**

First of all, this show is great. If you haven't seen it, check it out. It's on Netflix. It's basically about this Horse who was an actor in a famous 90's TV show called Horsin' Around. And now he's in his 50's and dealing with long-term depression. 

Well season 5 just came out yesterday and I'm loving it so far. It's gone in an even darker direction than the rest of the show. 

Well in this particular episode of season 5, he's taking opiate pills for his herniated disk that he got from messing up a stunt for his new show. And his sister flushes them down his sink because she thought he was trying to drug her. So they go on a search for more pills because he's ""in pain"". Later in this chase, they're being chased by the police, and he lifts his sister and himself over a fence in order to get away. Well once they get away, his sister points out that his back shouldn't be in pain if he was able to do that. He denies up and down that he's using them recreationally, and takes her to the airport so she can go back home. 

On the drive home, he stops at a red light, and picks up the empty pill bottle. He holds in up and looks inside, desperately hoping somehow there'll be another pill inside, then licks his finger and swirls it around the inside of the bottle. He starts jittering and sweating and looking around frantically, then speeds through the red light and gets into a massive car crash. The next episode starts off with him having several broken bones, and taking more pills. 

This is probably the realest, most accurate portrayal of addiction. I know people, personally, who have done something like that; hurting themselves to get painkillers. I, myself, have frantically and obsessively shaken my bottles upside down, hoping some nonexistent pill would fall out, licked my finger to try and get pill dust. I've been clean for 9 months, and this episode was very triggering for me. 

Anyway just thought I'd share. Check out Bojack Horseman on Netflix if you're interested. ",1537225654.0

I no longer make a living valet parking cars at the hotel downtown.

Not that I ever made much of a living there, at least not the way people who own houses and cars make livings, but you get what I mean. Maybe the better way to say it is that I no longer eek out enough money to pay rent at Dale‚Äôs place and manage to save a few dollars by surviving on a diet of Spam and diet coke with the money I make as a hotel valet. No more. It‚Äôs over. The train ride home tonight is the last time I‚Äôll be coming home from work or wearing the uniform, and as unhappy as I was working there, as boring as it was, I‚Äôm sadder and emptier about losing the job than I would have ever imagined. It hurts.

I‚Äôm missing my regular A.A. meeting, too. Usually, I‚Äôm sitting in the church basement right now, listening to some old timer rattle on about how a person will stay sober all day if they don‚Äôt take the first drink or some newcomer talk about how he thinks he can smoke weed and still be sober. It‚Äôs always interesting to see the reactions it gets. Sometimes, I laugh at the way it all goes down. Sometimes, I cringe.

I‚Äôm not there for that tonight, though. No laughter. No cringe. No awkward exchanges at the meeting. No serenity prayer or seventh tradition. My whole life is off course. I‚Äôve derailed it. There was an obvious break in the track ahead, but I just went on at full steam, anyway. Didn‚Äôt do the things they say to do in N.A. and A.A. Never called my sponsor. Now, the first impacts are being felt, and soon my life will be a smoldering heap of twisted metal. I will lie. I will steal. I will use whoever I have to use to get my drugs. My days will dissipate like smoke. My bones will burn like embers in a fire. From the wreckage I will emerge as the monster that I am, the monster I have to be to feed my addiction.

Sounds melodramatic. I know. I‚Äôm just not sure how else to say it. What‚Äôs stranger about all of it is that even as I become as ruthless and ridiculous as I can become, even as I hurt people, I will long for love and approval and friendship. It‚Äôs hard to explain. It‚Äôs not rational, but neither is drug addiction. For now, though, the changes are subtler. Less severe in every way. For now, I‚Äôve only relapsed and lost my job. For now, I‚Äôve only missed my home meeting and failed to call Jerry like he asked. For now, I just have to get to my room without talking to Dale, if I can avoid it.

I do. The shower‚Äôs running when I get home, and the light in the bathroom is on. The door is shut. He is blowing his nose and hawking loogies in the shower. Dale is singing some old gospel hymn. My room is black and chilly when I get into it. I close the door and collapse onto my bed, pulling my shoes and socks off with my feet and letting them fall onto the floor in the dark. The heroin is wearing off, but residuals sit in my throat like an egg and in my stomach like a warm molten metal. My mind wanders. Life is a practical joke. I think to myself. One I don‚Äôt get. I remember the first time I realized that life seemed to be an inherently miserable and melancholy affair but was also somehow comical in its irony, even if it has never made me laugh.

In my earliest memories my mother has no face. Seriously. I know that‚Äôs weird, but that‚Äôs how it is when I think of what she was like during my childhood. The way I remember her renders the woman who gave birth to me as nothing more than her body from the neck down, whatever clothes she was wearing and accessories she carried or the way she smelled at any given moment, like at night when my dad used to read in his armchair under the lamp and she smoked cigarettes on the phone and laughed with ice cubes clanking in a glass of liquor. Those nights she is a lit cigarette and the sweet smell of mixed drink to me. But on this night, the one where I am bawling in my bed because everyone I know in the entire world is going to die, she wears a thin cotton gown. Sun spots on her chest and moles on her soft white arms. I can smell lavender and cold cream glycerin. There is a pink handled comb in her lap. She strokes my hair. To me, my mother speaks with the voice of God, but it is feminine and worn and glowing radiant light from behind the clouds hiding her face, the clouds my memory puts there for some reason. She whispers that I‚Äôm an ugly crier. She says my face is covered in red splotches and gets up to turn the lights off and leaves me in the dark.

The memory doesn‚Äôt end there. My father comes in an hour or so after her. He must hear me crying on the way to his bed, separate from my mother‚Äôs bed. So, he turns in at my room at the top of the stairs but leaves the lights off. The lamp in the hallway backlights his wild hair. His silhouette is identical to Albert Einstein‚Äôs. That is what I‚Äôm thinking even though I‚Äôm still crying, and he asks what‚Äôs wrong, and I tell him, and he throws his head back and laughs like it‚Äôs all some sick joke he‚Äôs in on and been waiting to see play out. He speaks again. The gleaming white calcium of his teeth makes me realize that under his skin and hair and fat and without all the soft tissue and blood, my own father is just a skull and skeleton talking to me. I distinctly remember thinking that, even as I am having this breakdown at five years old. The thought scares me. All he has to say about everyone dying, though, is that I‚Äôm going to die, too, but that only makes me bawl harder. He matches my crying with even louder laughter, sitting on my bed and his hand on my chest.

As sleep takes over in my room at Dale‚Äôs, the memory of my father changes into some strange mixture of Albert Einstein and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr and himself. Three in one. The images of that night at five years old melt into incoherent dreamworld silliness and visitations from nightmare beings who whisper. I have visions of evil in the dark, and everything is on fire. I‚Äôm a melodramatic person. What can I say? And if I am, it only makes sense that my sleep process is, too. Then, it is the black void of slumber for the rest of the night.

The front door bangs shut and sends a rattle through my bedroom windows.

Blinds are drawn. Grey morning light pushes through them. Dale‚Äôs Ford Explorer starts outside and drives off. I‚Äôve slept later than I have on a weekday since I‚Äôve lived here, and it gives me terrible anxiety. There‚Äôs also something about brain chemistry when you sedate it with something like heroin and remove the sedative, even just once. The brain‚Äôs natural energy and thought life feels unnatural and over stimulated. There‚Äôs a bit of crust in my eye like a giant bacon bit with sharp corners. Drool on my face is slimy and stinks. Splotches of white decorate my pillow case. My neck and shoulders ache.

Dale knows I‚Äôm not at work. That‚Äôs not good. It will require an explanation soon enough. Probably, anyway. It‚Äôs possible that it won‚Äôt, but if I do ever have to give him one, I‚Äôm going to lie. That‚Äôs just where it‚Äôs at now, and I don‚Äôt care. Calling Beth is the next item on the list of things to do.

My brain is on autopilot, like it has relegated all decisions to the parts of my brain inherited from our reptilian ancestors. Those parts are baser and more primitive and able to pick through the subconscious to determine what course of action is most profitable to feed itself. It makes decisions based on realizations I don‚Äôt even know that I have had. Beth hasn‚Äôt been to a meeting in a month. We‚Äôve only talked a few times over the last two. She‚Äôs relapsed.

The phone rings through to her voicemail. I call back. She answers and says that she‚Äôd come get me, but the baby is sleeping and can‚Äôt be woken up. I‚Äôll have to take the bus to see her.

10

I smoke Winston cigarettes.

They remind me of Ghostbuster‚Äôs, and that's why I like them. Now, Beth is sitting on the floor asking me for one. I pull it of my soft pack. I also like soft packs. They‚Äôre retro, kind of, at least to me, and she reaches up. Beth grabs the lighter on the scratched coffee table. It‚Äôs the one I helped her pull out of a dumpster last winter. There‚Äôs a Where‚Äôs Waldo book, a few rolling papers and a small pile of weed. She turns her head to light the cigarette, so she doesn‚Äôt set her hair on fire and asks me,

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know. Same old. Same old.‚Äù I laugh.

‚ÄúNah. This is not the same old, same old, Randy.‚Äù The banter of some old macho cowboy blares in black and white out of the TV on the wall.

‚ÄúAre you sure? Seems like it to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm sure. What‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm not tripping on you or nothing. You just don‚Äôt ever come over here on a Thursday morning. You have a job, remember? Or am I wrong about that?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt say anything. Just smile.

‚ÄúGot fired?‚Äù She speaks sweetly. Her words are full of a certain sadness.

‚ÄúNo. Not exactly. I wouldn‚Äôt say that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat would you say?‚Äù She laughs a little.

‚ÄúIt was time to retire from my career as a valet. What? Don‚Äôt you think there‚Äôs a time to move on from something?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. But, usually, when someone moves on from something, they have something to move onto. Ya know?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly! What do you think I‚Äôm here for?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. So. You moved onto me, have you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I don‚Äôt see why not, baby.‚Äù I smile big. Our relationship has never been like that.

‚ÄúBaby? I‚Äôm not your baby. Besides. Gunter wouldn‚Äôt have it.‚Äù Gunter is her sugar daddy. He‚Äôs an old miser who immigrated over here as a kid but now pays her rent and bills in exchange for whenever he wants her companionship. It‚Äôs hard to think that they have sex, but I don‚Äôt know. Either way, he‚Äôs not possessive of her. A true sugar daddy.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he gotta know about it?‚Äù I look up at one of her baby doll heads. Beth has a thing about decapitating baby dolls and painting them. It‚Äôs her artistic expression. At least, that‚Äôs what she says.

‚ÄúUm. This is his place. He‚Äôs gonna know if you live here. He comes by with groceries twice a week and has right to come in whenever he wants.‚Äù

It‚Äôs true. I can‚Äôt stay with her, and I know it. Her baby cries from the back room, and Beth runs to go get her. I haven‚Äôt seen the baby since Beth first had her and brought her to all the meetings for everyone to meet, like a piece of pink and grey ball of mashed up hamburger meat in a napkin that we all passed around. I always have a hard time knowing if I‚Äôm acting right in those situations.

Am I making the appropriate goo goo gaga sounds? Am I supposed to talk to it with words? Why would I? They are usually sleeping. Babies don‚Äôt understand anyway, but I‚Äôm always afraid of seeming inhuman. So, she comes back in with her daughter who has turned into an extremely selfish and irrationally angry monkey over the last ten months. The child pulls Beth‚Äôs hair and screams. She knocks things over and laughs. It seems like children always want to do the worst possible thing they can, like play with the chemicals under the sink or stick something in an electrical outlet or crush themselves by climbing on cabinets and pulling them down, but I‚Äôm not much different. I like poison and doing things that will probably get me killed too. For some of us, nothing ever changes.

I ask Beth if I can use her Facebook messenger to message someone. She hands her phone over. Sal is as easy to find as he said he would be. He comes right up and even responds to my text immediately. I text my number and wait on the couch for the call. There are six 20-dollar bills in my wallet. Sal‚Äôs got the fire.",1537219456.0

(And a long ass story from me),"Has anyone hid their use from their girlfriend/boyfriend? What problems did it cause? Did you end up telling them eventually? Has anyone kept using and never told them at all and had them never find out?

I apologize, but as always from your good friend Angry Chair, this post is probably gonna be longer than it needs to be, but I‚Äôd like to tell it all to someone and get it off my mind.

 I had a serious and pretty long term (at least for my young age at the time, about 2 years) relationship with a girl but we both had trust issues and many other issues and well, she was crazy. We both were I guess. We got too serious too young. We planned to get back together in the future after some time apart but after a couple days apart she missed me a lot and wanted to get back together really bad, but when I meant in the future I meant maybe a couple months or a year in the future, not a week. 
I moved on faster than I should have and started talking to other girls within a week after breaking up. I guess I was just glad to be free after being young and attached to one girl for so long. I made the mistake of getting serious with another girl in 2 months (big mistake).
Anyways I never used dope when I was with girl A. She was very controlling and would say she would break up with me if I started using hard drugs, and I agree it was very stupid that I stayed in that relationship and obeyed her rules but I guess it was good because my life didn‚Äôt spiral out of control until we split apart and I was free. I did coke behind her back sometimes but it was no big deal. 
I can‚Äôt remember if I tried dope once or twice while we were still together, but I do know I didn‚Äôt get actually into it until after we split. 

So I started talking to Girl B, and around this time I would use dope maybe once every week or so, sometimes a couple days in a row, sometimes going a few weeks without it (basically whenever I could find it I would do it.) I ended up overdosing in front of Girl B the morning after I made her my girlfriend when me, her, my best friend and her best friend (we were trying to get them to hook up) all stayed at my friends house for the night and drank and chilled and what not. I told her I ‚Äúthought it was coke‚Äù and got sold something else, and she found out it was dope but I told her it was an accident and that was the only time I had ever done it. So that scared me away from dope for a couple weeks but needless to say I started doing it again, but still not getting hooked. I would do it whenever I could find it cuz I just felt like I was a better version of myself when I was on it. Well one day came where I used a few more days in a row than I should have and woke up in withdrawal. (Not the first time, but i still wasn‚Äôt in an active addiction. I would feel kinda shitty for about 2 days and then be fine, find some dope again a few days to a week later and start it all over) it wasn‚Äôt terrible withdrawal but I was anxious, depressed, had the shits like a race horse and couldn‚Äôt eat for the life of me. This day just happens to be a day I promised girl B (who I was now dating at the time) that I would go to her nephews birthday party. Great. a kids birthday party while dopesick. I get through that day and throughout the rest of our probably 8 month relationship I get pretty into my dope use (but nowhere near where I am now) and she never finds out. I didn‚Äôt have a steady supply, it was basically random when I would be able to get dope so I would always be sick when we would go to parties or events or when she would wanna just hang out. It sucked. 

Few months down the road I realize that Girl B was just some girl I wanted to fuck and I truly belonged with Girl A, but she had found another boyfriend (of whom she is still with) and by this time hated my guts because she thinks I cheated on her when I didn‚Äôt. Wtf. (Young relationship drama lol) The tables turned and I started missing her a lot and basically stopped giving a fuck about Girl B but continued to date her for another couple months maybe, just because I was lonely I guess. How sad. Eventually I just break up with her because wtfs the point lol My relationship with girl B was a joke. 

It‚Äôs been about a year since me and girl B broke up. I am deeper into my addiction than ever before and I miss Girl A more than ever. I wish I got back together with her when she wanted to. I feel bad for Girl B for hiding my use from her after oding in front of her and staying with her when I knew I was still in love with Girl A, but girl b was honestly kind of a whore and wouldn‚Äôt have understood my dope use the way A would have. 

This went from a post about hiding use from your S.O to a novel-long vent about the past 3 years of my life. I apologize for the annoying and whiney bitchey post, but I guess I just needed to get it out. If you read the whole thing I really appreciate it. Anyway feel free to share your experiences with girlfriends (or boyfriends, whatever you‚Äôre into) and drug use. Feel free to share anything. Doesn‚Äôt matter what. And call me a pussy if you want, I could care less, just wanted to let my thoughts out somewhere as my friends/family would be no use because they wouldn‚Äôt understand. Hope everyone‚Äôs having a good day so far. Your friend, Angry.",1537208454.0

My wife was away from home over the weekend at her brothers... He had recently had a baby and my wife was there for delivery. 

She flew back in and got off the plane and couldn't even walk straight. My kids noticed it right away and started prodding her about it. I grabbed her arm and told them she was tired and got her to the car. 

When we got home, I took her upstairs and figured she would sleep it off (not the first time she has come home completly wasted, though it is rare), and I went downstairs. I got her bags from the car and put them inside. 

Then I heard the garage open and she went out to the car to ""get her bag"". In more than 10 years she's never gotten her own bag, she's always sent me to go get it. So I got suspicious... And i dumped her bag out. 

I found nicorette (which her mom chews all the time) and some chewing tobacco stuff which her mom also chews... And then I found a pill box of oxy from my uncle who is in the hospital. I called her mom to see if she asked my wife to hold any of her tobacco/gum and she said no. And I knew it wasn't an accident that she had oxy from my uncle. ""Why would I want that? What does it even do?""

After a long fight and argument when she was more coherent I just agreed it must have all been a mistake (I don't but I also don't think arguing will help anything). Her parents are worried now because I told them in an effort for some help on this, but they are the type of people who believe their daughter can do no wrong, so I wound up causing them drama for no reason, especially when they won't help. Question is.. What can I do?

I don't even drink so to me this is very strange to confront, I don't know how to catch her in the act and obviously I have thrown out everything I found. She won't admit she did anything and I kind of figure this was going to happen, because she doesn't want to shame her parents or me.

Yesterday i found a pill crusher and dilaudids in her purse. What do i do? How do I help her? (X-post),"My sister has struggled with pills for the past 5 or so years. It all started when she started hanging out with the wrong crowd, failed out of college, and later got a DUI. 

It's been 2 years since she last relapsed and her DUI. She works as a full time manager at a retail store and went back to school as well. I'm so proud of her and I let her know that. 

She's been acting very strange. She's been extremely jealous, anxious, sad, and needing my full attention constantly. Also she has been spacing out, pupils tiny, and her eyes have been going half shut with very long blinks. My dad is very suspicious but I haven't told him what I found yet. 

I went through her stuff yesterday and I found dilaudid, Xanax, a straw, and a pill crusher. I am so sad she's back on this and all I want her to do is get help and stop. I've been told that she looks up to me and I have the potential to turn this around. I've asked her twice now if she's doing anything and she promised me she hasn't (she lied). 

I'm not sure if I should full on confront her and tell her I found x, y, z, how do I help? Or I just wait and hope she stops on her own. I live 1500 miles away from my family and am unable to be there for her through this. I told my mom already since she lives with her. What do I do? Please help. 

 She's also been hanging around a bad crowd again. The people there do the same thing they did at 20 years old and they are 30 now. My sister needs out but she's an adult and I can't tell her what to do.. she's also been doing cocaine and drinking on everything I've mentioned above. I'm so scared she's going to lose her job and fail out again. 

She's made her friend know that she wants to stop but doesn't know how. She feels empty 24/7 and even worse without the drugs. This all started back again after she got surgery and was prescribed pain killers. She also has a ton of stress but I just don't know what to do. 

UPDATE: I confronted her. I told her how much I love her and I'm her for her. I also said I went through her things and was suspicious and I only did it because I was so concerned. She gave me the pills to throw away but kept two green hulks. She said she took them last night but I know she lied. I let her know I know she's lying and I hope she can make the right decisions. I won't ever see her as a failure because I know how hard this must be for her. I'm hanging out with her all day today and doing what she wants. 

She was also concerned about me telling my mom and said she will tell her when she's ready. I told my mom last night because she needs to know too. My sister lives with my mom and needs her support as well. I just hope I'm doing the right thing at this point ",1537188776.0

We met back in 2013 when she used to serve me dope as the main cartels man's girl. And i don't mean main squeeze- she was his *girl.* And in two years of hearing all the local junkies calling *him* up, it was her doing the serving. Every time I came it was on my way being middled there by a roommate or an ex - but it was always *her* doing the transaction. Many times in a car full of dudes it was everyone... Shamefully, including me, hitting on her when she ran out. I mean, who wouldn't? With a beautiful half Mexican, half italian face and a body built like a pocket rocket at 4 ft 9.... I'll let your imagination do the rest.

I always noticed her loyalty to her man. Cartel or not. Biggest kingpin in the area at the time or not. She was a sexy woman. She handled the most hands on of jobs. She ran into just about every guy who would ever want her. I noticed her loyalty. I kept watching. I shut my mouth.

""Do i know you?"" She said to me one day as my middle was inside the opulant five bedroom house she shared with her high ranking, cartel owner. ""No, im C's friend, but i dont think We've met."" Little did I know that within 10 days her big cartel kingpin would be facing 80 years up the road.

Little did she know that under the most dire circumstances, id wish that on *no one.* Little did I know the death threats to follow the next month of my life. She had no clue i lived 5 minutes away walking distance till the day she showed up after the raid.

I could go on about how I ended up falling in love with her to the point of a suicide pact. I could say that she wasnt a nymphomaniac almost to the point of a fault and she couldnt cook better than most five star restaurants. I could say that i had golds in my mouth as a latino and knew how to carry myself before i was with her for 3 years. But what's the use in flaggin u know?

Rest in peace my bear cub. Im more in shock 3 suicide attempts didn't bring us back together. I've had more women and money in the past 3 months than ive had my entire life. Remember when you always said ""if i die, you'll know whether guardian angels exist?"" Well now i know that they do. Just give me one that can buy me happiness.

Cuz that fentanyl should take names. But it doesnt. It's good they cremated you. At least i know they burned me with you.

Often times, doctors are ready to write you a prescription. One of their first choices for pain are opioids. The most common are OxyContin, Vicodin, and Codeine. Many get prescribed these for legitimate reasons, but some people game the system. The people looking for opioids for non-legitimate reasons often use them for depression, anxiety, and emotional numbness because of situations.

I‚Äôm first going to expose how easy they are to get. I went to the podiatrist, and after an operation, he gave me a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine. I knew this was a drug of abuse, so I only used them whenever I really needed them. I maybe took 5 out of the bottle of 30 over a span of months. I could‚Äôve easily gotten addicted to these, so that was the reason I used them as sparingly as possible.

The media has recently given us information on why opioids are so often being abused. They have made statements that they are being used by addicts for depression. I‚Äôve read that opioids have ¬®a general numbing effect on both the body and mind¬®. If you are going through rough patches of depression, it may seem like these drugs are perfect for you; they aren‚Äôt. ¬®Some addicts gain tolerance and need more and more¬®. This easily leads to an overdose, and ¬®you can overdose much more easily if you take opioids with alcohol¬®.

Mainstream media has also said that people use opioid painkillers to eradicate feelings of anxiety. Being that painkillers also numb emotions, people think it‚Äôs a good reason to take opioids. ¬®Any use other than using painkillers for pain is considered abuse¬®. Addiction can easily take over anybody, but people with anxiety that have access to opioids and also have no self-control, is a recipe for addiction. 

It‚Äôs scary how fast a doctor is to write you a prescription for opioids. ¬®Many people get addicted even if they are legitimately being used for pain¬®. On the other spectrum, there are the people who abuse them. Popular opioids such as OxyContin and Vicodin are all too frequently being misused by people who have emotional problems. People suffering from anxiety and depression with open access to opioids are at ¬®high risk for addiction and dependence¬®. One last note, if you get hooked and run out, ¬®withdrawal is painful and could be deadly¬®.

And my last dose of Klonopin was about 5-6 days ago roughly 2mg; my last dose of Valium was 4-5 days ago at 40mg.

Now I‚Äôve read that Benzodiazepines (such as the ones I‚Äôm on) can take 4-6 weeks to fully get ride of the
 *drug metabolites* to be able to pass a urine test. 
Now I don‚Äôt know how true or not that is but I‚Äôve been put on Ativan at the age 13, went on Valium a little over a year ago, and added Klonopin in less than a year ago.

Now the thought of losing my whole future to my past drug abuse to opioids/being on maintenance medication really, really scares the hell out of me.

Ended up having to stay in hospital for over a week because I'd aspirated so much spew that without constant supplementary oxygen I was in danger of hypoxia, I was on IV antibiotics and a constant drip of saline because I somehow had an acute kidney injury from dehydration (I was lying on the ground for almost four hours before I was found, I have no idea how I'm alive. Just lucky someone was in the house and heard the death rattle and came to check on me). I also managed to fuck my face up by lying on it for almost four hours, luckily it wasn't broken but I had a lot of soft tissue damage and my jaw swelled to the point where I couldn't even open my mouth wide enough to fit a sandwich in. It was incredibly painful and obviously the docs wouldn't give me anything stronger than paracetamol.

&#x200B;

Anyway, as soon as I got out of hospital I was back to smoking a gram of H a day. Did that for a few months, then a couple of months ago, on a whim, I went to my local needle exchange and got a goody bag. I'm deathly afraid of needles but it was scarily easy to jam the needle into the crook of my arm and from then on I was off to the races. (Please do not start injecting heroin on a whim, it is a lot easier than you think and once you get it good luck stopping)

&#x200B;

(Now we finally get to the point)

&#x200B;

So I'd been using the vein in the crook of both elbows (think it's called the medial something something vein), but I was starting to get a fair amount of scar tissue, to where it started worrying me because it was difficult to get the spike in, so I decided to hit the back of my hand. Obviously I missed and now I have a bump that's about 3cm in diameter and feels like I have a golf ball under my skin. It doesn't hurt, I've been to a doctor and shown them it and they said it looks OK right now but to keep an eye on it. That was last week though and there's been no improvement or worsening. I'm just worried it's going to get infected, which would suck because I've been clean for almost two weeks. Just when I think I'm out, they drag me back in.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: missed a shot, 3cm raised, hard bump under skin, no pain. No improvement or worsening over a period of a few weeks. Should I worry about an abscess forming, and what can I do to help my body break down whatever it's trying to seal off?",1537140023.0

Has been reported to give slight euphoria and when taken in conjunction with opiates patients have reported it helps the opiate ""find the pain better"" meaning orphenadrine in conjunction with opiates increases the analgesic relief.  

I took a few days off methadone mainly for a  bit of a tolerance break and this eased the hot and cold sweats and sick feelings really effectively. Also a 200mg dose at bed time really assisted sleep. Just thought I would mention it because I havent seen it on guides for opiate withdrawl before. ",1537120734.0

I usually don't dream at all when using, but it seems to really be on the nights I am cutting back or trying to slow down.

As a kid I was always into sports - soccer, baseball, basketball.. and my family, esp my dad, was always so supportive. Had a few coaches along the way that were so incredible a few turned out being like family to me, as well as my parents. I never even stumbled onto pills until after I had graduated high school, right before college. Its been so many years now.. 8 or 9.. that its really become my life (as would be putting so much time into anything for a decade). Really been struggling lately to break it off for real and for good, even though I see it within reach - a decent car, saving money, I actually have pretty much come to 0 on my debts and bills. I need to just take that extra push and save all of a few of my paychecks and I will be right where I need to be.

So onto the point, I've been having these surreal, vivid dreams where I am very young, about 10, at a sports tournament.. but I can never seem to get the strength to even get past the pre-game talk I am so focused on trying to get dope so that I am able to play. The first one was an indoor soccer tournament and I was struggling so hard to get the money together it was pure panic and I woke up before being able to. Next, a basketball one where this time was waiting on a dealer that I woke up before he ever came. Now last night was a baseball tournament where, with a coach that is like a father to me, I gave up defeat admitting to him and my parents there that I needed help and couldn't do it anymore. But that to play in the tournament I just needed to get well right then and that I was so sick my body was dying.

It's crazy and drugs were never, ever on my radar until much longer in life.  But my body combining the good, younger days, with this devil I've been caught under for almost the past decade. It really blows my mind how smart our brains are as humans, if we could only access more of it.",1537114841.0

So around 5 months ago I was really sick and had bronchitis I think and in my country the cough medicine (prescribed) is heavily regulated and I've tried to get it couple times when I had minor cough and the doctors don't prescribe it.

&#x200B;

Its good shit, there was 3.10 mg of codeine per 1 ML, and I had a 200 ML bottle. So the whole bottle had more than 600mg codeine and it also had efedrine 1.25mg/ml and a little bit of alcohol like cough syrups do.

I took a 30 ML dose, so around 30mg of codeine and I already felt a little effect, not much but at least my cough went away. I decided to redose and took 30mg more, so now im at 60mg. I got a little more itchy and more of a body high, and I felt a lot more positive. 30mg more and I already felt pretty high. My body was feeling really good, I was able to focus on   a game I was playing and music sounded pretty fucking good. Only on 90mg.

Highest I did was 120mg and that had me on my bed doing nothing but listening to music, whole body feeling just perfect. I remember trying to eat or drink and it all tasted shit I just wanted to relax. I also got itchy as fuck, but I didnt bother me.

Left my ex some time ago and we haven‚Äôt spoken much about anything for a year. Recently let him back into my life and see how completely addicted he has become. Carrying drugs and needles and spoons in his lunch box, doing meth just to wake up every morning, shooting up H at work idk how many times a day or night. Mixing it sometimes.. the ‚Äúgoofball‚Äù or whatever it‚Äôs called. I don‚Äôt know all of  it. He told me he‚Äôs overdosed 8 times. He acts like he did it on purpose. He says he knows how much he can handle and he wont overdose again. the first day I was with him was good but he got a little weird/paranoid. It scared me a little because the things he was saying was just so off and not like him. The second day he was in a great mood, talkative, loving. The third day I had to care for him 4+ hours during what I thought could end up as an overdose, I took care of him as well as I could. 

In the beginning, before we split, he had a severe alcohol problem. or so I thought but it was actually cocaine as well, I had no clue. It has apparently progressed to this. And continues worsening. 

I told him I can‚Äôt have him around as it is just too dangerous. I told him I love him. I told him I‚Äôll support him in any efforts he‚Äôd make for recovery and getting the help he needs and taking steps to go into rehab, etc. he said he‚Äôll go to rehab Monday. (tomorrow) I doubt he‚Äôs going to go, he said he can‚Äôt do inpatient. I didn‚Äôt ask him to go or anything but That‚Äôs what he said. He begged me not to leave him. I feel like he‚Äôs desperately reaching out for help but doesn‚Äôt want to quit. 

Last night he said that he has nothing else to live for so he doesn‚Äôt see the point in quitting. He said if he had his kids back then he‚Äôd quit. I told him how backwards that it is. He was using heroin for the little time while they were in his care anyways and he lost them for that reason. That‚Äôs just his addiction talking I know but it breaks my heart and I fear he will die soon. I‚Äôm very concerned but what else can I do. Nothing. It‚Äôs such a bummer. He was my best friend, the only man I have ever loved. He has a lot of potential. But I feel that he isn‚Äôt even a person anymore. Just an empty shell of what he used to be. 

He‚Äôs been using H for a year and he‚Äôs lost everything. His wife. Kids. House. All his money. A couple cars. His job. His freedom. He looks really sick. Everything is gone to the point where he is homeless and luckily now he‚Äôs at least able to sleep on a floor at a friends house and find a ride to work. Like at one point does anyone decide to quit? I am so scared that he‚Äôs going to die. He‚Äôs been at rock bottom for awhile. 

Anyways I just wanted to vent a little. I know this is the opiate group but I thought if anyone understood it would be you guys. I probably sound crazy or obsessed idk I‚Äôm just worried. Please delete if this kind of post isn‚Äôt welcome. I‚Äôm just going to continue to be here for him to talk to and I‚Äôll help him if i can but I don‚Äôt wanna get myself involved in this disastrous cycle he‚Äôs in. ",1537103105.0

TL:DR- Want to ask psych to up dose from 90 to 120 bars (max prescribed dose) per month and also an adderall prescription.  Should I ask for both at the same appointment? Or should I ask for one of those things at a time between two appointments? 

Background: Okay so I first started seeing this psych after multiple people I knew went to him and had success. First appt I walked out with a script for 90 2mg xanax a month. This was back in October of 2016. Over the time since then i had asked and he switched me to klonopin 6 mg/day and another time he switched me to Valium 30 mg/day at my request. When I asked to go back on xanax he in so many words said it‚Äôs 100% up to me which one I want and he didn‚Äôt care. So I went back on 90 bars a month back in February. Now I know he‚Äôs prescribed people adderall and xanax before but I don‚Äôt think they were prescribed as high a dose as I am. My reservations for asking to up my xanax dose are that it‚Äôs already pretty fucking high and 120 would be the max he could rx. My reservation for asking for adderall is I‚Äôm not confident he would go for it. Worst he could say is no but I‚Äôm wondering if I should ask for both an increase and the addy script in the same appt or if I should ask for one before the other and in what order. Honestly this doc is very liberal I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he prescribed oxy for neuropathy or some shit.

Just wondering if anyone has advice on how/if the timing to ask for these things matters",1537082108.0

**I'm still married and she has no plans to divorce me but it's clear this is going to mess with our relationship for a while. She is worried much like I was worried she would be and I suppose what now bothers me the most about having told her is that every time I have talked to her since the subject is brought up and she has more questions and concerns. Clearly it is slightly better to now have this all out in the open and she does have genuine empathy for my struggle with depression and I think can help me. Certainly when I feel the world would be better off without me I have someone to talk to now unlike before. Thanks to everyone that gave me the benefit of their best advice and helped me to find the courage to get this done.**



TLDR: My lifetime supply of fentanyl was lost in a freak accident and now I have to start subs which are only available daily in the methadone line at the pharmacy so my dear wife is sure to find out sooner or later, asking if I should tell her and more importantly the best way to do so if I must?

It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been troubling me a lot more than usual lately: I‚Äôm a secret addict. I apologize for the length of this post but as much as I appreciate people‚Äôs opinions and find the collective consciousness of this forum very helpful, I don‚Äôt think your opinion will be as helpful to me as it perhaps could be if it isn‚Äôt based on the right context and considerations so a little background is really required.

I went to seek help and told an addictions counsellor about my problem (quite a few months ago now)  but before that there was absolutely no one in the world (except for random people on the Internet like yourself who is currently reading this) that knew anything of my problem. I‚Äôve been opioid dependant off and on for 30 years but it‚Äôs gotten worse in the last couple of years and I‚Äôve been dependant 100% of the time in the last year. I used opioids to control depression on an as required basis for 30 years but 15 years ago when I was married it had been at least 10 years of nothing, no opioids or depression so I really thought I was done with it at the time. 

It‚Äôs almost a cliche that I ended up using heroin as a less expensive alternative to prescription medication and more recently when that became too expensive to be sustainable I started using pure fentanyl hydrochloride directly. Several years ago my heroin started testing positive for fentanyl but I had no choice to use it (carefully). As I was using fentanyl anyways, even if I didn‚Äôt want to, it only made a certain amount of sense to investigate and learn if I could use it more directly. While far from ideal for my purposes it is better for me than heroin in so many ways and it is of course a lot less expensive than daily heroin (pennies per dose).

In the beginning (over 30 years ago) I was pretty naive and seriously believed I had the flu the first couple of times I got dope sick.  It was so long ago I don‚Äôt really remember now but I would remember having run out of what I needed and that just wasn‚Äôt the case because I remember those few times during which that happened very clearly. So I was dope sick and really had no idea, if I had only known I likely would have just dosed to abort the withdrawal syndrome but I hadn‚Äôt yet connected the dots (30 years ago) that I had become dependent, rather I had just stopped using by choice to see if my depression would return and coincidentally thought I got the flu at around the same time.

I‚Äôve never directly lied to my wife unless you count not telling her about my increasingly serious problem with opioid dependency as a lie or the fact that I suffered from depression some 10 years before we met but hadn‚Äôt had any trouble since as a lie which I know some people absolutely will. If she ever directly asked me in such a way that it was not possible to give her a truthful answer without lying I‚Äôm know I would tell her the truth. It was really difficult for this addictions counsellor to understand how I could have the problem for so long and no one knew but here‚Äôs the thing, I don‚Äôt get high, I just dose enough when I have to that sends my depression into full remission (almost as effective as a light switch) and then I would simply stop dosing, usually well before dependence developed.

I have some insight into how she might react to this (very badly) because not long after we were married (and before the depression returned) I had a problem with alcohol dependence (fortunately dependence and not addiction, there is a difference) which developed after my parents both died and I was stupidly using alcohol as a sleep aid. While this alcohol dependence was developing, my wife would never forget to prepare a rather stiff drink for me at bedtime, to help me sleep. She was as naive as I was about the danger. I would drink only at bedtime, wake up the next morning renewed and refreshed go off to work without fail.

Eventually one evening I came to my senses and resolved to stop doing this to my liver as the amount required to help me to sleep was ever increasing and clearly getting out of control but it was already too late, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I started to sweat and soon developed nausea, vomiting and a rapid heart beat.  Sitting in front of my computer at 4 or 5 AM (dial up modem Internet in those days) and trying to figure out what was wrong with me I researched my list of symptoms and ‚ÄúAlcohol Withdrawal Syndrome‚Äù appeared on my monitor. I remember I sat there frozen and in a daze, staring at it for the better part of an hour before it sank in that this was likely what was wrong. The means to confirm my amateur diagnosis was pretty simple so I drank some gin and very soon felt much better. The next day I couldn‚Äôt believe how stupid I had been to allow this to progress so far. I researched how to fix it, obtained the required amount of valium (diazepam) to substitute for alcohol, created a spreadsheet with a taper protocol to dose a slowly decreasing amount of diazepam every 6 hours over the course of 7 days (5 was recommended as sufficient but I wanted to be sure) and had the serious talk with my wife as to what had happened and how we were going to fix it. She wanted me to go to inpatient detox but this was exactly what they would do for me there and I didn‚Äôt want the embarrassment of anyone else in the world knowing how badly I had screwed up or how stupid I had been.  I had lots of paid sick time at my job and anything less than 10 concurrent days didn‚Äôt require a medical certificate but I still used vacation time to do this as I didn‚Äôt feel I should be taking paid sick time to treat a self inflicted wound. I took a week off from work and she was a trooper, waking me up and giving me the medication I had self prescribed in strict accordance with the protocol over the next week. After it was over, I went to a good number of AA meetings at my wife‚Äôs request but I simply couldn‚Äôt relate to the people there, I wasn‚Äôt an alcoholic and had no urge to drink, rather I had just become alcohol dependant because of my ignorance and no longer was but my wife was absolutely terrified. Only after we went on a number of Caribbean vacations where all inclusive (already included or free) alcohol was excessively abundant and she noticed that I drank responsibly did she seem to stop worrying herself sick that I was an incurable alcoholic. 

A couple of years after we had put this behind us my depression returned which was obviously very disturbing to me but I knew what I could do about it and of course I did. Perhaps the relative ease at which I had put alcohol dependence behind me played a role here as well. Ok, not perhaps, it definitely did. I was still very naive and probably felt at the time that if I did become dependent on opioids I could simply replace it with something else or slowly taper down the dose and leave it behind me as easily as I did with alcohol and even as I had been able to do with opioids in the past but of course I was incredibly stupid and obviously very wrong, fentanyl is a quite a very different animal.

As I started to realize the amount of money I was spending I starting taking steps to bring that under control. I learned that I could dose a lot less and still not be depressed. I was able to make what I had last longer. Of course like anyone, my tolerance increased and eventually the pills got too expensive and like so many I turned to heroin. I remember one of my early experiences with the wonderful warm euphoria of heroin and thinking ""If this is all I ever get out of this life I might be fine with that"". I really didn‚Äôt get high very often. Sometimes I would go through several grams of heroin without getting high even once. Getting high wasn‚Äôt important to me -- having my life back was and I really found heroin too sedating. If I did push enough heroin to cause euphoria it was very short lived because all I wanted to do was to take a nap. I suppose if I hadn‚Äôt found heroin so sedating it really could have got me with a serious addiction but I really didn‚Äôt like it because of how tired it makes me feel. At some point all my new batches of heroin started testing positive for fentanyl. I really had no choice but to use them carefully and as I was using fentanyl even if I didn‚Äôt want to I started to investigate if it could be helpful directly. Eventually my tolerance increased and the heroin got too expensive so I started dosing pure fentanyl hydrochloride directly. It was a lot less expensive than daily heroin. It also isn‚Äôt useful for getting high (perhaps some of the analogs are but not fentanyl itself) but just using it (without getting high) was sufficient to keep me singing with the radio and not depressed.

When I met with an addictions counsellor I found out to my great dismay that In order to get into the buprenorphine program I have to give up my job (because it requires me to be able to fly the friendly skies) and that‚Äôs a pretty big decision I can‚Äôt make without involving my wife but I know from past experience that she will react badly and be worried and terrified all over again and I‚Äôm really having a hard time bringing myself to do that to her.

In my country, suboxone is treated the same way as methadone with no difference. I will have to go to the same pharmacy every day for the remainder of my natural life. After three months I will be able to get two additional doses friday for use on the weekend but the strict monitored dosing and urine testing goes on forever. The program costs something like $40/day in my area which is $14,600/year and without a job that‚Äôs a lot of money. There is just no way I get to disappear everyday at the same time for very long before my wife figures it out or worse jumps to the entirely wrong conclusion (she is always encouraging me to ‚ÄúGet a Girlfriend‚Äù but just the same that‚Äôs only because she wants what is best for me and I really think she‚Äôd be hurt if she knew I actually had one).

I know that my tolerance for fentanyl is increasing because it does take more now to control the depression and I also have some pain (likely from opioid-induced hyperalgesia) and I don‚Äôt want to continue dosing fentanyl for years.  I have only a small supply remaining and it is rapidly getting harder and much more risky to obtain (really impossible, not for lack of trying). 

The Intervention

Handling and mixing pure fentanyl hydrochloride is very dangerous. The amount required to keep me well for a week is pretty hard to see and doesn‚Äôt look like much of anything with the naked eye. To make it safer and easier to handle and mix precisely, I had dissolved my entire inventory into an aqueous solution, 1 liter of bacteriostatic water mixed with fentanyl hydrochloride to a concentration of 5mg/ml, so that one bottle was just about 10,000 strong doses or really a lifetime supply. This was usually stored safely in a cabinet in my office, the one room my wife knows to leave be (she knows she can do as she pleases to the entire rest of the house) and there are no children in our home. I stupidly left it out on the counter for a short time after mixing the required amount for the next two weeks (every two weeks I reduce by 5% when I am tapering) because I got interrupted before I finished. The door to the office must not have latched completely and one of my wife‚Äôs cats got in and knocked it off the counter. In a freak accident, it landed mostly upside down. The problem wasn‚Äôt discovered for several hours and 98% of it leaked into the thick pile carpet where it was unretrievable. Obviously, I am the world's dumbest idiot for leaving it out and not making sure the cap was on more tightly. In any event, the lifetime supply had become a couple of months supply and that was a couple of months ago.  I have spent quite a bit of time and effort trying to replace it but that is simply not meant to be.

I have been coasting along the last couple of months, dosing fentanyl each and every day but never enough to get high and tapering as much as possible and I am becoming increasingly aware that this simply isn‚Äôt going to end well. I know I allowed this to happen and I have to accept the consequences but I‚Äôm feeling pretty trapped and don‚Äôt know what to do. I know if I tell my wife she will either leave me or she will dig in and help but I‚Äôm really not sure which way she will go on that. With each passing day it becomes a slightly bigger problem. 

I know when I run out it will not be pretty, although I have been tapering as quickly as I can, there simply isn‚Äôt enough left to complete a taper and even if there was it‚Äôs likely my depression will return at some point (it pretty much always does when I am in acute withdrawal).  Suboxone is a better solution for me (stronger kappa which is associated with depression or rather the lack of it) according to the last 20 studies I have read on the matter.

Knowing this disaster is coming real soon now I‚Äôm not going down because I was too embarrassed, proud, or stupid to ask for help so I went to my Doctor and told him what was up. He was shocked of course, and then became very distressed and withdrawn saying he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with it and referred me to the lady Doctor in change of the methadone program and I‚Äôm scheduled to start on that path next week. There is no heroin in my part of the world (just pills) and the stigma is so very strong here.

It‚Äôs a small town and as soon as I start standing in the methadone/suboxone line every morning she is going to know at some point. I know I can hold out for a while by picking a more distant pharmacy but it‚Äôs only a matter of time.  It‚Äôs easy to hide drug use when it has no effect on you (except the positive one of not having depression) but I can‚Äôt hide disappearing at the same time every day and not being able to travel for very long (the methadone Doctor said she‚Äôd call in prescriptions in distant cities for me but I simply don‚Äôt believe she can do that, I can‚Äôt even keep up with the travel schedule sometimes, it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect her to be able to). We have two cars but I still think it is wise to pick one within walking distance just incase. I know it‚Äôs likely better if she hears it from me but I‚Äôm losing my mind with worry that she will divorce me.  

Do you think I should tell her or just try my best for as long as I can not to get caught?  If you think I should tell her any thoughts on how best to do it (thus the reason for this crazy long dissertation so you know all the machinations)?  She was really frightened with the alcohol incident and to her (never having even seen heroin in her lifetime) this is likely to be much much worse.

The only comfort I have is I know that the end of my life will end my addiction (and my depression).",1537078183.0

Let's talk drugs! I took a tuk tuk downtown and literally within 30 seconds I had a guy walk up to me and tell me he's got every drug under the sun. I bought a fat bag of weed and some black opium, they're quite nice to smoke together. I also got half a G of heroin, but quite overpriced (for here) at $50. Strong stuff though. I don't know if it was just that guy, or what. He says all the heroin has to be imported and blah blah blah. 

Anyways, I got all my supplies, and then ordered a large happy pizza to go. What is a happy pizza? Well, there are dozens of restaurants downtown that advertise ""happy"" food - which means they cook it with weed! Like, openly, advertising it on the signs and shit. I got my pizza extra extra happy - the taste was actually quite good as well.

From a PDF on the Immodium site we find that lope is well absorbed orally but has an outlandish first pass metabolism rate above 90%.

That lope is not absorbed well because the pills have magnesium stearate in them? This makes no sense because this is a common binder is pills of all sorts.

So last night I went to a friend's house (we'll call him Aaron) to smoke my h, and he asked for a point and he'd get me back when he bought some today. Aaron needed needles too, so I brought over some today and he bought me a pack of cigarettes in exchange. Aaron asked for another point today, and so did his roommate (we'll just call him roommate). I told them call the d-boy and make sure I can get more bc I'll be out if I give y'all each a point. So Aaron called him and d-boy said yeah come through in 30. Roommate gave me cash for his point, and Aaron is supposed to give me 2 points out of his sack. Then Aaron gets stuck on the phone with his crazy ex, and once he gets off he says he just dropped acid. So I said ""bro wtf, I need to get my shit tonight."" And roommate told me ""you act like you'll go through withdrawal or some shit."" Like yeah, I will. He's tryna tell me that since I smoke it, withdrawal isn't a thing to me. And now since it's been 2 hours since Aaron called the d-boy, he's not answering. So I suggested let's go through my guy, and Aaron said fuck him, he's not getting my money.

I've been using opiates/benzos/gabapentinoids and others recreationally for the past year and thoroughly enjoying my life üòä

One thing that I have never experienced is a nod. I hear people talk about this all the time but for me up until now, its never happened. 

Well, this morning I took 10mg Diazepam, 600mg Lyrica and 60mg Oxycodone, brewed myself some Blue Mountain and had a chill day. 

This evening, I had chosen a great Prime show to watch (Mr Robot), had pizza and then took my Saturday night dose.

So, 1,200mg Lyrica and 80mg Oxycodone down the hatch. (No benzo BTW, however I am aware that my morning dose of both Lyrica and Diazepam may still be active)

Well, I was watching the show with my sister and suddenly got a tap on the shoulder. 'youve missed most of the first episode?! lol)

Apparently, I had nodded off. I awoke half way through the second episode feeling great lol.

I am still feeling great now. I am very cautious when it comes to mixing benzos with opiates however less so with Lyrica.

Ok so anyway, this friend of mine (I use the term friend loosely) hit me up and mentioned he‚Äôs with his girl friend and she had 2 bags on her she was trying to sell, he said he‚Äôd sell it to me for $50. I jumped on it bc usually when I ask, he charges me double (we agreed on a mutual understanding that I‚Äôd buy him a bag if he could grab me one, because I don‚Äôt like going on the runs, so I have to trust that he comes back every time, and he always has so far. I think it‚Äôs fair - I‚Äôll buy you a bag if you can grab me one, right? Well then it somehow became $50 extra, than $100 extra, basically just pushing it as far as he can.) Usually when I grab a bag off him, I pay double + more. So anyway, back to the story... I sent him the $50, he came by, dropped the bag off, and then I start smelling it, doing it and mixing it up, and realize the dopes a little off perhaps? Now, this isn‚Äôt my usual dope from my normal guy. However, I have tried this dope once before. it looked the same pretty much but Idk, it just had a weird consistency in the spoon this time. Kind of looked like clear mucus, Idk, lot of tiny little clumps in it too. I torched it just incase, and then there were little particles left behind, which duh makes sense, that happens sometimes with certain shit. Whatever. I do it, doesn‚Äôt feel like all that, kinda ‚Äúeh‚Äù ‚Äúso-so‚Äù not a nice rush or anything, which it had done in the past. Did it once more and still same reaction - ‚Äúeh‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs alright.‚Äù Long story short - I‚Äôm wondering in the back of my head if it‚Äôs possible he put a little bit of baby powder or something in it to make it look like it‚Äôs more dope when it‚Äôs really not, ya know. I mean, why else would he be selling me a bag for $50 when usually he charges me double + some..?  I‚Äôm thinking, maybe he took some out for himself, mixed it with a little bit of baby powder, and sold me half or maybe less than half of a bag, and charged me $50. So for him, he‚Äôs basically making $50 off half a bag or less and then getting an actual hole bag for the same amount. Im very generous, but I‚Äôm even more skeptical. I have no idea what baby powder mixed with dope would even look like though? I tried googling it lol but uhhh... I cant really find nothin‚Äô for ‚Äúwhat does baby powder mixed with dope look like?‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing on here either, I checked! or maybe I didn‚Äôt look hard enough. 

Either way, do you know what baby powder mixed with dope looks like? Or how can you tell if ur dope is mixed with baby powder, or something of the sort? 

Any answers would be cool... Sorry I don‚Äôt have a pic... I did it all lol... and even if I do get any type of answers it‚Äôs all gone now... but for future reference it would be nice to keep an eye out for. ",1537057631.0

How do you deal with the nausea and throwing up?
Are there any good meds to keep that away.
I have some diphenhydramines at home which would even help potentiate and get rid of this shit.
Sry for the shitpost, answers are appreciated.

Went to the Dr's at 8 am on the Sunday, they checked me over and other than a low oxygen count he said I was fine and gave me some antibiotics, which I've saved for something useful(I get tonsillitis frequently). So this week I took the week off work to try and taper, costing a fortune in pay and feeling pretty bad about my poor attempy at stopping.

Today I decided to have a second attempt at it and I'm now getting that same chesty cough I had last week, I've got enough codeine to do a 50 % reduction over the week, back to work Monday no matter what. I feel stupid, I thought I was in control  and didn't do the smart thing and try a longer taper.

I know it's only codiene but I've not experienced this before, having done other drugs in my life, non have left me physically dependent like this, its quite amazing. 

I hope the chest thing is withdrawal and not something more serious, seems to be a lot of Tb coming to the UK from Asia etc. 


Good luck to all those quitting.
