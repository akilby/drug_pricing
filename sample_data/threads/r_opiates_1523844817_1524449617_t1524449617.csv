Sublingual ROA is by far my preference. I'm torn between sublingual and buccal. I humbly consider myself a pro as far as the technique but I'm never above advice.  I recently started heating the patch under a lighter just before administering under the tongue. DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE AN INSANE TOLERANCE!! I got to the point of 100mcg patches not satisfying my thirst. This technique will knock your socks off, trust me. The first time I did it I thought I was toast. I want to hear you guys' personal techniques and tips, maybe I can pick up on something.

If you do decide, which I DO NOT CONDONE, be very cognizant of the following:

Pull up the hard plastic film (touch the sticky side as little as possible) and grab it on the very tip of one of the corners with a pair of tweezers. Remove it completely from the plastic, turn the patch horizontally with the sticky side up (facing the ceiling) and start about a foot over the flame. Once you notice the heat causing the patch to rise and flutter hold it still. The sticky side will start to glaze over and seem wet. Be super careful! Angle your eye to where you can see the flame through the patch so you can monitor the texture. If you notice the patch start to go transparent from the outer edge inward STOP. This is a no-no, you're too close to the flame and burning up the medication rendering the patch useless. The sweet spot is when you see it super glossy and glazed over all-the-while maintaining the blurry transparency the patch originally had. Once you get it right pop it under the tongue or in between  the gum and cheek. It takes alot of practice and finesse but when you get it right...GOT-DAMN! Be somewhere comfy because you're going down for the count on Unicorn Island son!

Use your head. Know your limits and be damn sure you have a friend around in case it's too potent. That's not going to happen though because you're smart enough to know not to try this! ;P

Oh and I do this with cut up pieces of the patch. Not the entire patch. Use your head.",1524431754.0

Anyways, I just faced some pretty serious legal consequences and managed to avoid prison and instead completed a one year intensive outpatient program (and by intensive I mean 5 days a week 8 hrs a day - 45 min to an hr drive from my house). It was exhausting but I felt great that I did it. This time though I didn‚Äôt go to meetings. I didn‚Äôt get a sponsor. (And I won‚Äôt in the future so please no AA/NA is the only way types bc that not true.) I basically just showed up to group bc I was legally required to. But hey I finished it. Never completed a program in my life. So... go me. To that rehabs credit though they focused on my mental health disorder PTSD and that was amazing help. 

Fast forward a bit I ended up suffering a miscarriage a few months ago. I didn‚Äôt even think I could have kids so I was so excited just to be devastated w the loss. But I got through it -clean. 

Something just clicked in me and I don‚Äôt feel the need to always non stop think about getting high. I missed so much good stuff in my life doing that. I just feel like I‚Äôm over it. I‚Äôm too tired to go running around like that again. Staying high everyday is tough work (and people call junkies lazy- bitch please I worked my ass off every day to feed my habit. Granted it wasn‚Äôt ethical work or contributing to society but it was work and it sucked and I‚Äôm grateful I made it through that.) I‚Äôm too old and tired to go through all this again. 

I just got back from an extended visit w my significant other. He lives in another state and has a great job and is moving to my state just to be w me. I am so blessed. He is so sweet to me. Like one of those guys that I‚Äôm positive will love me for me forever. My penguin. However,  the visit was great and all but he‚Äôs a medical professional (DO) and he doesn‚Äôt drink. Doesn‚Äôt party. Goes to bed at 9pm wakes up at 4am. He‚Äôs an amazing human being and I don‚Äôt understand why he lives me like he does. 

Anyways on my trip I was alone in his house all day long. Bored af. It was cold af so there was no going for walks. He has one car and it‚Äôs a stick which I can‚Äôt drive so I was stuck in the house all day long. Bored af. So. Of course I peruse Reddit for hours on end. Specifically the heroin opiates and cocaine subs. I used to do this just to try and offer support to people like ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm a complete fuck up and I did it you can too‚Äù  ‚ÄúDid it‚Äù to me means no heroin no shiesty behavior and basically I‚Äôm alive not a zombie and around my family and friends now. 

Okay here‚Äôs the problem. I started talking to a friend kind of romanticizing how great and eight ball of crack and 30 Oxus would be. Then I was looking at those drug subs all day. Triggered af but stubborn and tough so no big deal I tell myself. Then I get a msg from an old dealer that he‚Äôd just like to ‚Äúsee‚Äù me. Mmmhmm. I was about to entertain the idea when I decided if I‚Äôm gonna do it I‚Äôm not getting involved w a dealer. I‚Äôll call a friend and just go party one night and that‚Äôs it leave. Well this particular friend and I used to smoke a ton of crack together. I thought I would go over there, we‚Äôd do a few hits, go to dinner, then blamo I‚Äôm outta there. 

Guys I get to my friends house and he looks like a shell of his former self. Gaunt, can‚Äôt remember things for a conversation, tells me the military just deemed him 100% disabled. He‚Äôs a combat vet. (W an arsenal of guns in his room. And I mean arsenal. I‚Äôm all for gun rights but I think we need to look into the people w serious mental health disturbances but I‚Äôm on a tangent)

Moving on. This dude in the almost two years since I‚Äôve seen him has become a crack smoking aficionado. Has a box of special order pipes to his specs. 1000 per box. 3 types of chore boy. Stem holders that double as coolers. 100 bic lighters. Scale that measures to the  .0001. Huge glass jar filled of hard. 7gs to be exact. I almost couldn‚Äôt speak it was like heaven and hell at the same time. We ended up smoking it all. I was shaky and felt weird bc I‚Äôve never smoked without heroin to level me out. He gave me some kpins. Thank God. 

He goes to bed. I try to sleep. Made it an hour. Came back upstairs and pushed the fuck out of every pipe we used. My fingers were black from that oily chore. Gross. I don‚Äôt want to live like this I just keep going through the motions though. 

He won‚Äôt wake up and it was like 11am. Time to get up bud I‚Äôve been up all night. I tell him we need to go get more before I have to go home tonight bc I have regular life Monday that I‚Äôm certainly not fucking up. He won‚Äôt get up. I get pissed (why? I dunno bc once a junky always a junky and I wanted more) So my genius idea is to go cop myself from the guy that sent me that msg. I kept him in my Facebook ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù (Please no levtures about all we have to change is everything bc as I stated above I‚Äôve been to rehab A LOT.) So I go meet Justin Case and get more hard and he throws me a ‚Äútester‚Äù of boy.  When I got back I weighed it and it was a fucking half g. For free. Trying to pull me back in. 

I did a line. Bc I‚Äôm weak. It was amazing. I‚Äôm all warm and fuzzy but I know that‚Äôs just heroin  lying. That‚Äôs how it gets you hooked into slavery.  Point of my story. I do not want this to be the day I throw everything away (just the heroin in my pocket) I‚Äôm not going down that road ever again. I got a preview- it still sucks- I‚Äôm still out. 

I can‚Äôt believe I did this. But at the same time I‚Äôm not gonna wallow around about losing my clean time. When people make mistakes they acknowledge them and move on. Too many times I‚Äôve relapsed and went on a two year bender bc I was so ashamed. So what. I fucked up. I‚Äôm handling it. I‚Äôm still me and I‚Äôm still awesome. I‚Äôm still claiming my date bc that‚Äôs the day I really began to fight and took my life back. I give zero fucks if anyone disagrees w that. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm gonna stand up at a meeting and say ‚ÄúHi my name is so and so and I‚Äôve been clean 20 months.‚Äù I don‚Äôt go to meetings and I‚Äôll live my life how I want. 

I had an abusive controlling ex who died of an overdose and now I currently reside w my abusive mother and I‚Äôm tired of being put down. I‚Äôve done it to myself. Others do it. I‚Äôm tired of it. Yeah I shouldn‚Äôt have done that. But when people make mistakes they shrug em off n keep going. 

‚ù§Ô∏è

TLDR ended up getting a free half g from a dboy, threw it away (did a line), still consider myself awesome bc I‚Äôm not jumping into that nightmare again. 

Also if your sober and have idle hands, stay outta the drug subs kids. If you must go go for support or help and don‚Äôt spend hours salivating over drug porn. Learn from me. Ms. FuckUpUSA. And you know what- I‚Äôm damn proud of it. 

This could have been way worse. ",1524427639.0

Did dope today, like 20 min ago in fact and my wife wants to actually watch me take a sub today.  Obviously thats a no go due to PWD. 
Is it way to risky to even let the sub touch my mouth since I still have dope in my system? I was thinking of like, wrapping the sub piece in cellophane or clear tape or something of that nature so that I physically could put it in my mouth and then spit it out. 
Not worried about her watching me the whole time, just the initial popping it in my mouth. 
I have the orange strips as well as some white pill form subs. Was thinking about tryna find a white mint and pose that as my sub pill, problem is she knows I typically blow the white ones.

Such a goddamn degenerate I know, but I absolutely do plan on this being my system starting tom with her to get my fucking ass off the junk. But I woke up with like 1.5gs left and I aint about to flush that shit

That Trams can be taken concurrently with suboxone (we are not debating this in this post. **this is FACT**)

I know the norco half life is about 4 hours, would it be safe to take the Ativan then? Or are these prescribed doses so low that I‚Äôm not risking anything.

And only a few days after I threw away my dope, I bought it again.

I smoked some that day, but had 200mg left. Yesterday I met a girl who's my ""net-friend"". 

She wanted to buy drugs, and failed at doing so in the city centre. I said I could probably sell her something, and at first I had speed in mind as she already uses it.

She figured out that I had some heroin too, and she really wanted to buy it. At first I was hesitating, not wanting her to start doing it. She told me she was going to share half of it with a friend, and take small amounts/be careful.

I set the price at double the amount I paid. She then nearly doubled the amount I asked for, but I was still hesitating. Then she offered me 5x the price I paid, which I thought would get me a bit money for drugs.

I couldn't resist the offer, though I was also pretty high when I sold her. I'm not a dealer or anything, this was just a one time thing. She said she'd be careful, and remember that this was her first time.

Today she sent me a snap. She took all of it at once by injection. I thought ""Fuck! Fuck! FUCK!!"" because I was afraid she was going to OD. 

Luckily nothing bad really happened, thiugh her body started to shake and she threw up when the comedown hit her. I'm relieved as fuck. But to be honest it really irritates me that she promised to be careful, then she ends up injecting the entire thing when it's her first time!

Meme-poster, shadow commenter and long-time lurker of this sub. Kind of just venting because I feel conflicted.

I moved off of one coast to the other coast (USA) and quit using opiates about seven months ago. I was in a really bad spot after relapsing (I had thrown away three years of sobriety at that point) and I needed to escape. I have a good job at a non-profit and I'm more than likely going to receive a promotion next week- I fell into the normie culture that is your late 20's/early 30's. 

Anyway, when I moved, I totally abstained from opiates here. They're not easy to find where I am and to be honest, at this point I'm too fucking lazy to put in the work to try and find them. BUT- in June, I'm going back to my hometown for five days to visit and I've already been texting with my old dealer (we were... well, kind of friends. Poor Ry-tard- bless his soul) and setting up for him to hook me up with a whole script of percs.

Every logical fiber of my being is telling me- ""NO- don't do this- you know how awful you're going to feel afterward."" but every other passionate part of my brain is like: ""You've been sober for almost a year now- you've earned it- let yourself have fun. Just live in the moment.""

I'm writing this as if I'm going to even consider making a different decision when I know damn well I'm going to cop the first day I'm back home.

There is almost no information on this compound. I have searched through scholar and research databases with no success, and the only information I found about this compound after searching for information for 2+ hours online is:

1. It is 100+ times stronger than morphine
2. It is a codeinone derivative, which is essential for the creation of hydrocodone primarily and, to a lesser extent, oxycodone, as a substitute for thebaine.
Edit: Forgot to add it's LD50:
3. It has an IV LD50 of 31mg/kg in mice. This is much more higher than similar strength compounds like fentanyl. 

From what I know about chemistry and looking at the chem spiders:
*Codeinone is 1/3rd the potency of codeine. Codeinone is a ketone of codeine, which can be achieved by removing two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.
*The addition of a 14-cinnamoyl chain to hydroxycodeinone(which is another name for oxycodone) results in a minimum of 66-fold increase in potency.

This is speculation, but I think this semi-synthetic opioid could change the pressed pills game entirely. Having something that is so powerful in small quantities that is comparable in effects to oxycodone, it seems that it could make pressed roxis become almost identical in effect and feel to the real ones, and cost far less than a dollar per mg. on the street.

Does anyone have knowledge about this substance? It seems completely under the radar of not just research, but RC users and distributors as well.",1524345687.0

Shortly after, a couple of kind do gooders reached out to me and implored me to get a script. One said ""when you have a script, you know you can just go to a real pharmacy and pick it up. No more getting stressed out when someone doesn't answer the phone or doesn't show up on time. Also makes it easier to make travel plans."" Then they ended with ""P.S.- You won't have to deal with that bum Cliff anymore.""

&nbsp;

So I speak to the sub connect and they pushing to see me early at 11am so I say, I gotta sleep off a mean cold but I should be around. They then show up in my 'hood around 11am even though I never responded to their text before they departed.

&nbsp;

Hours later I make new arrangements to meet them half way, near my job. So they take some odd ball bus that doesn't let off near my job. They then text me while on the bus but they don't tell me where they'll be exactly. Then they call.. the call drops. I try to call back no luck.

I get one more text.

""My phone is dying...""

&nbsp;

After I finished my paperwork at work, I head toward home. On my way back home I get a call and the person is like ""no, please meet me on the other-other side of town. You know what, the cross street they proposed was near my planned final destination so I say fuck it I'll do it.

On the way there they go ""I can get a rid to that cross street, there's a mcdonalds I'll go to."" Then they say text when you're 10 minutes away. So I do. Before the 10 minutes the connect texts ""we're here"" and keeps texting ""how many minutes? how far?"" and ""please hurry"". Like dude, I told you exactly how long I would be when I left. There is nothing that changes that on a bike on hilly terrain.

&nbsp;

I get to the cross street. I see no McDonalds. They go ""meet me at McDonalds"" but that's 14 minutes away. So I decide, just meet me at my destination. No, they say we can drive to you mad quick. Well, turns out they could.

&nbsp;

Car pulls up to the curb, she loudly gets out of the car but kindly gives me my product in exchange for cash and it's the mint flavored zubsolvs. The Yemeni deli owners across the street are looking at me like ""that car stopped next to a cyclist, they talked briefly, the car left and the bicyclist went his separate way.""

OBV looking shady as fuck.

Before last November, I was taking 10\-20 mgs \(just 1 or 2 pills\) of hydrocodone daily.  Had back surgery in November that went well.  Immediately following surgery for about 2 months I was taling between 6 and 10 Oxycodone a day.  By the end of January, 2018 i had slowed that pace to 1\-2 10mg pills a day.  Since  mid\-March I've been more or less maintaining on just 1 10mg oxy / day.  

By 2 pm every day I feel the screaches.  The reminders that I need the meds.  I've gone for single days a couple of times, but never more than 48 hours before I cave in and relieve the nastiness with a pill.  I'm nearing the end of my prescription, and know I wont have more without making up some kind of story, because my back surgery really was a success.  I want to get off the meds completely, but the question is, how long will I have the immense need to stop the screaches...that piercing ear ringing, the nasty fuzzy head/body need for the dose? 

It's been a very long time since I havent had the meds in the body.  Is there something that will help me get through completely weening the craving?  I've got about 3 weeks worth of oxy left in the bottle at this rate.  I dont want to find the bottom of the jar, without first stopping.

This is how I replied: ""Donating to your local needle exchange isn't a bad idea.

They help keep users from contracting HIV and Hepatitis C from dirty needles, give them information on local clinics that treat addiction, and if they can afford it, distribute Narcan that is the #1 way to reverse overdose and save the users' life.

As far as personally, support your friend. There's not a whole lot you can do for an addict other than urge them to stop using (without being crazy about it), and keeping Narcan on hand, in case they overdose in your presence. Learn how to use the Narcan effectively as well.

Thanks for your compassion. Users have a tough time as it is, but if enough people are like you, and care, I think we can take care of this problem.""

We used some more last night, and this morning we both woke up feeling pretty shitty. He had to throw up a few times and I nearly had to while feeling cold. We both have recurring headaches.

This led me to wonder, how quickly can one get withdrawal symptoms from this stuff? And what can one do to ease symptoms such as these? Also, any respectful information on how quickly one can get addicted is appreciated, since we both lost (and gained) some of the typical opiate fears around (ab)use and chipping.

We didn't like it very much at first, yet we both felt the need to use the next day, even though our rational minds told us it wasn't even that fun. I honestly prefer ketamine and benzos to this vague, even slightly nauseating feeling. 

Heroin isn't sold much around here, and we've both used an absolute shit ton of drugs in our lives, 30+ and 60+ respectively, but have never used anything to fill a void. Our lives are fulfilling and we're likely just going to slowly use it up over the next year or so and never seek it out again. (Just to avoid tons of concerned posts about addiction; I know very well how slippery this stuff is, especially now that I've experienced it first-hand)

I moved out west around 8 months ago from across the country out east. Shortly after being here I gave in to the temptations and start using black tar. I prefer to use IV and this tar has completely trashed all my veins I can barely find one to hit when I really need too.

My good friend from back home said he would happily send me out a couple of strips (4) and a few baggies (to enjoy before the subs). What would you say the best way to do this is?

i tried one tonight it worked well

i might even use them to quit subs altogether. 

hopefully i dont get addicted t tram . the jitteryish high at even lowish doseages is kinda weird, but 50mg before taking my subs was fucking awesome and i was pain free for a few hours and i thank that nurse for that one pill that she didnt have to give me due to our fucked up laws. 


and i thank her twice if she actually got me a script (supposedly the papers, and nurse said i did)



i realize to you guys tramadol isnt a big deal but i have seen so many doctors and i even saw a neurologist recently whom i was referred to by my insurance. we called ahead of time and made sure they treated tmj. when i got there , he didnt give me any meds, and told me he does not work with the jaw. he ordered me MRIs of my head, which ive already had done.


I asked him 6 times to order a MRI for my jaw


I was referred to pain management and a chiropractor i cant pay for . even though he said to me ""why go to a chiropractor if you know it doesnt help you""





Atleast this nurses/doctors (she seemed likea new doctor) stayed within her bounds and respected me to the upmost {without getting fired i guess} . The other ERs ive been to have not been kind at all! These guys atleast presented a few options . and atleast gave me a tramadol when i asked . 



i heard her speaking with the nurses about how to override the narcotic thing on the prescription monitoring thing lol. was presented with one tablet to go home . so yea. atleast some respect was given. atleast some relief was achieved. 



do you guys think i would have any luck if i went to a ketamine clinic there are 3 near me

I currently don't have a primary care doctor, but have no problem getting one.  I have previously been prescribed Flexeril but after that didnt help i didnt pursue anything further at the time.

While I am taking it for pain due to Crohn's I really want to try and live my life without being beholden to medicine. Especially medicine that messes with my mood. 

I have been tapering for the past 6 months. I started at 16mg a day (2x8mg for pain), and was able to go all the way down to 0.5mg a day. But I was miserable. Every day I would go into withdrawals within 6 hours of my last dose. Making the conscious decision to no longer be miserable I started taking 2-4 mg a day. I'm rationalizing it as being needed in order to pass a job interview. 

Long story short, I tried extremely hard to go from 0.5 mg to 0.25 mg so I could jump. Instead of doing this I am wondering if anyone has gone through Rapid Detox while on Buprenorphine? Because of it's long half life I'm wondering if being under while the naloxone works is going to be enough to make it through the worst of the withdrawals. I've never had an issue with wanting to take pain meds again after detoxing, manually. I always start back up from a Crohn's flair. So I figure, I get this job, save up the money for rapid detox in a couple of months and just go get it done and deal with the long term post opiate effects.

8drjol,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8drjol/green/,4,https://redd.it/8drjol,dopenomo,Green,"A dull snowy day in the city. We dropped off the hustler girl that didn't do drugs, and made our way to the spot. ""Joe"" let's us in. We need 5 girls and 5 boys. We spend $100, made by committing various crimes. I didn't participate in much, but I still got a small share. I never liked the way everything was split up. At least I would still get some. 

Ol girl and her friend are prepping up their shots and talking about having hep c. In this abandoned house, we sat in the old dining room I would assume. Dirty yellow walls and brown flooring. A ripped blanket covers the door entry to the next room. Empty baggies and used needles piled up in the corner. A rectangle coffee table sits in front of the ripped up loveseat. My girl didn't have a working rig and didn't want to share immediately after them. They said there might be an extra one in the truck. How stupid. Asking for it. 

As she came back inside, I saw her holding it. The numbers were faded, and there was still dried blood inside and out. In this moment I was consumed by anger and fear. Begging her to not do this. It didn't matter. She needed her dope and there was nothing anybody could do about it. 

I couldn't take it anymore, so I walked outside to the back of the house and sat on what was left of the back porch. No idea what time it was, and I felt like I was alone forever.¬† Nobody came out to find me like deep inside I wish she would. I knew the reason I was so mad was because we both shared rigs. 

Eventually, I hopped down to the driveway and came back in the house. She was sitting on ol girl's lap. They laughed when they saw the look on my face. How did I get to this point in my life? It wasn't over anytime soon.

Ps: hi ariel! I can't wait to hear from mom later about you messaging her what i post on here, you sad loser piece of shit.

Does your girl friend know about the fucked up messages you send to your mother and brother?

We clicked in day one of detox and had awesome chemistry until the end. Her name is the same as my ex (love of my life) she's a musician like me as well, both have webbed toes, same sense of humor, and list keeps going. She started righting me notes... nearly professing her love for me. She was obsessed with me and I loved ever second of it. It was mutual.

She left and we planned to meet up afterwards. When I was leaving she happened to be in the front lobby because she had left some items on the rehab wing. I left two days earlier so she wasn't expecting me to be out yet.

She ended up driving me home and we fucked for hours and quite literally professed our love for each other. We both had multiple Os. I spent the last twenty four hours with her... she just left.

No the sketch part is that she is a stripper, has had two kids, she is 32 and I am 28, and she has an abusive husband who gave her a black eye and put five cig burns on her face and arms the day she got out. 

She's has crazy daddy issues, self worth issues, every one she deals with is still using. She has PTSD and other diagnosis. 

She is absolutely gorgeous, very funny and dorky. She is a kind of punk rock chick/Tom boy. She is so sweet to me. She also has lots of money and wants to be my sugar mama. She is going to pick me up on sunday and get us a room. I have only had sex this good with one other person.

I am also on a high dose of gabapentin. Long story short, my wife cut me off everything two days ago. I thought maybe if I go get a dose of methadone it will help my back pain at least for a little while. I spent 3 1/2 hours in that clinic this morning talking to a counselor, and doctor, filling out paperwork, getting drug tested, etc. This is a long term program and is every involved. I finally took my 30mg dose this morning which tasted like watered down cough syrup and guess what? My back still hurts and I feel exactly the same. I wasted all morning for this. I guess it's back to square one now. Like I said, probably great for the serious addict, but for someone like me it was a waste of time.

I'm feeling tons of anxiety. Out of breath. It's fucking miserable just to walk. I just downed I think 14 of lope and I'm going to drag myself out in a few hours to find some kratom to make it through the weekend.

My body is screaming that I need more drugs--and I definitely did the junkie search to make sure there wasn't anything I had missed (there totally wasn't). It's 2 long weeks until my refill and I've got no plugs and no hope for one. 

I'm trying to remind myself that I wasn't any better on the oxy. I was dosing every 2-3 hours and was completely fucking useless. I slept every weekday for 2 weeks straight. I have been generally unmotivated, empty and void. I'd rather do that sober. 

Weekends are tough cause it's 48 straight hours of the whole family home. I've got nowhere to hide. They can see every step of my pain, every struggle to walk, the difficulty sleeping, the insurmountable fatigue. It's embarrassing. 

I truly hope the Lope and kratom and some caffeine pills will help me make it through. It doesn't help that I ran out literally the day before starting my period, so I've got that on top of everything else. 

This really blows. Sorry. Shit post but I don't have anywhere else to whine üëé

I think it might be what‚Äôs in the fucking dope out there right now. I don‚Äôt know. All I know it‚Äôs that not even a week of fucking around, literally not even a full .5 altogether,  I woke up yesterday dope sick. Not shit your brains out, projectile vomit (although I did projectile vomit once, it was weird), knocking on deaths door level. But still. Dope sick enough to make me remember why I never want to be in that cycle again. Fuck that. Anxiety, tired but can‚Äôt sleep, hot/cold sweats, restless as fuck but still can‚Äôt manage to actually function enough to leave the house. 

Maybe I needed this to remind myself why I cannot ‚Äújust do a shot once in awhile‚Äù. Not worth it. Anyway....what the FUCK though? Is my brain just trained to associate doing dope, then not doing dope with withdrawal symptoms? Making me more sensitive to it ? Or is it my first guess, which is this dealer is a piece of shit and if there is any actual HEROIN in that dope, it‚Äôs kinda like a  ‚Äúcan I have some heroin with my fentynal please?‚Äù ratio. I know when I was regularly using for a year, Fent was just becoming a thing but I noticed the withdrawals were way worse. Even with no tolerance, I did like maybe half a tenth in the first shot, felt that orgasmic rush, literally woke up 4 hours later, so fucked up it didn‚Äôt even feel good, barely able to stand up and walk to get myself a water, nauseous, and it was actually not very pleasant. 

Thing is though, unlike fentynal dope I have ever done in the past (including pharmaceutical grade pure fent administered via IV in hospital), this dope had legs. I always hated Fent dope because it had no legs. This shit is every bit like any Fent dope I have ever fucked with except that it stuck around. 

Well, I‚Äôm feeling quite hopeless and grim at the moment but I know it‚Äôs temporary. But yeah, I‚Äôm getting back on the shot. Already have my appointment. I don‚Äôt want to die and that shit will surely kill me.

I‚Äôve been doing drugs since high school and I thought I was invincible, xans, coke, acid, molly, etc.  I thought I couldn‚Äôt be addicted, that it was all in the head.  Boyyyy was I wrong.  It started in January 2017, im an 18 year old freshman in college and i was looking to score some oxys since I had done em a couple times before but never frequently, just opportune times.  A boy hooks me up with a dealer who had 20s.  It was awesome, I finally had a way to get oxys since they hd been so rare.  But the biggest problem was the fact that he always hd them, so I didn‚Äôt take days off because ‚Äúwho cares?‚Äù.  8 months straight of doing hella oxys and I‚Äôve spent so much ducking money.  I can barely even afford them anymore so my plug tells me he can get me this other shit and it‚Äôs way cheaper.  That‚Äôs when I started with heroin, again it was awesome since it was cheap as hell, but as tolerance built I was in the same situation.

Towards the end of this year I had to face my problem... well that‚Äôs a lie, my parents caught me and I had to admit my problem mainly because I was broke and I couldn‚Äôt handle withdrawals.  So early this January they put me on subs... but it wasn‚Äôt that easy.  I still wanted to get fucked up, so whenever I got money I‚Äôd buy heroin and stop taking my subs,  2 months of this and getting caught 2 more times.  We are now in March and it‚Äôs time to do it for real.  I‚Äôve been taking a sub a day since then and now I feel great.  I don‚Äôt crave opiates anymore, I never thought I would feel this way again.  Not having to worry about getting money to not be sick, just enjoying myself without this shit controlling me.

I know this same story has probably been said about 100 times by 100 different people, but it‚Äôs just my story.  My advice to any of you kids around my age that are thinking the same way turn the fuck around. You idiots who post pics of oxys and think it won‚Äôt take over your life and everyone else is just a junkie idiot but YOU can‚Äôt get addicted because your different.  Well guess what?  You aren‚Äôt different and if you keep taking this shit you will ruin your life.  Luckily I didn‚Äôt go as far as shooting and I‚Äôve managed to maintain my college grades but who knows where I‚Äôd be if I went a couple months longer.

That drugs will make it so the only thing you want is more drugs, at any cost. mom has heroin and you don't? you're going to stabville. yes even pot will evoke matricide. they have been teaching it this way for decades. if you are american, you know all about the ridiculous  drug education programs. guess what adults? the programs  are still mostly the same ridiculous propaganda. well My nephew and his friends, seniors and jocks, were so  astonished people could drive high, i questioned more .( they smelled weed from my friends car). They All were naive enough at 18, to still be  believing, that even with weed you can't control your self while high. i asked and found it's all the same shit still being taught. thus this post   SooooooooooooooO TEENAGERS LISTEN:  No, weed wont ruin your life. lsd doesn't make you jump out of tall buildings, and crack/ heroin are not addictions caused by one time use. You See, foolish as this sounds, we called their bluff on addiction. after being taught the same lies, we tried every drug. interestingly, we had not become addicts. obviously  they lied. They lied about everything except opiates. OPIATES Are not to be Fucked with. You will be dependent! it will control you. even as little as twice or once a week of controlled use can/will have you waking up dopesick, and unsure how weeks have passed since that 'control'. it doesn't take many days to get the ball rolling. IVE SMOKED CRACK/cocaine  scores of times/ Some times 3-4 dayS in a row. PERSONALLY I never had any withdrawal or cravings from coke.(this is just me though). BUT IVE BEEN A physically dependent heroin addict for over a decade! I don't have a problem with any of the other drugs. heroin will own you, it's undefeated. do not start using it.  they were not lying about opiates. now that you have the truth,  live life and find your joy.  find that joy any possible way, any way  that doesn't include opiates.  you're not special and you can't beat heroin  addiction's first enslavement. eventually, it will take control of your priorities and strong/weak, the end result is always the same. you will lose.  YOU will choose heroin over everything while with drawling. no human has won so far. it will leave you sweating, but bone cold. next you begin shitting while puking from the toilet. the  only break from this will be sneezing in rapid  fits.  that leads to routinely  wiping off the sweat accumulated . then you will be back to shitting ,while shivering.  sometimes, these symptoms   occur simultaneously.  sound fun?

I regularly take benzos that are prescription. Usually 2mg of kpin and 2mg of Xanax at night with a benedryl or a trazadone to sleep so it takes a lot to make me drowsy.

Last night I only took 2 kpins and no Xanax or trazodone. Normally that does nothing with such a small little bump of dope just a good relaxing feeling before bed.  The only difference was this time I smoked a bowl pack of weed and I was nodding so hard I was scared to sleep and stayed up until 4am when it totally wore off.

About noon yesterday I did a full point from the same batch and a full point again around 4 from same batch and it was super mild. That .04 at 11pm knocked me out hard and it was less than half of the earlier doses.

Note: God = God, the universe, your respective God by name, or a stand-in for gosh, goodness or golly.. Nonetheless, the three words for OMG are what I naturally blurted out upon hearing that which I shall share exclusively right here right now.

&nbsp;


Earlier today I woke up, communicated with Cliff and upon getting paid, arrangements were made. A week ago I took $100 dope and cash on loan. Why? Well I decided I didn't mind biking to the ATM on his behalf with his card if I was gonna be given dope right after. I did get dope right after and all went according to plan aside from getting home at 6AM but that was because I was playing games on my new-old-new laptop and making plans to see the new Avengers movie. 


Yesterday went extremely well. I didn't feel like anyone acted particularly shady, I got my money's worth every which way. First I got exactly one bun from Cliff minus the middler's fee for our middle. Then later after work I was like ""you know, I want more but I didn't buhy more earlier because I didn't want to expose myself to shenanigans or tempt Cliff or faith."" Yeah, that quote pretty much sums up my thought process.

&nbsp;

Thus I contacted Derrick for a half, then realized he was actually walking to his guy to pick it up and front it so I upgraded to a full bun, I only asked for a half because I thought he was gonna pull from personal stock. He took only one bag and it was all fat and good dope. Shortly after that, which occurred after work.. I ate dinner then paid a visit to Cliffords house.

&nbsp;


Well first to get to the point of this post, something I assure shall amuse you, or anger you, or bubble up some sense of obligation that makes you urge me to contact adult protective services, I must rewind to how things got to the OMG moment.


&nbsp;

Before work I drop by Cliff's hoping the dboy/middle would show up before I had work. He didn't, he showed up 10 minutes after I left for work so I had to bike back on my break. I couldn't wait a minute longer than I did and still be on time so I cut temporal losses.


Upon arriving at Cliff's his TV wasn't in the living room. I thought he was just dope sick and too lazy to move his TV but it turned out that the electrical power was turned off in his and his mom's apartment. To watch TV and to maintain power to the internet modem/router he ran an extension cord from his sister's dwelling. Strangely, he didn't even power the fridge. Just the TV, blu-ray player and modem. The modem became useless too after the cable company turned that off. I guess both of those bills were due today.

&nbsp;

So if not for the fact that I owed Cliff $100 from last week, he would have no way to get dope and when given a choice between electricity and dope he chose dope. Well, can't fault him for that.. I'm sure many of us have done similar lol.


&nbsp;

Okay, well, now that we got the setup out of the way here goes the mess of a punchline!


As some may know, every two weeks Cliff then his mom gets their roxy script. Cliff has to share some with is mom because she shares some with him. It'd be easier for her if she simply said ""I'm keeping mine for me, and you keep yours for you"". Sort of like what I did to bring my costs down so that I could buy electronics and bike parts. I'm not dooing perfect, in that I shouldn't be buying dope for myself at all but if I'm gonna buy dope I want to make sure I take care of Numero Uno first and foremost. 


I mean like, if his mom didn't have to share with him, she'd have more and wouldn't need him to give her any when it was his script day. I would say the inverse applies to Cliff but he doesn't have the discipline to conserve a script without having to tap other sources. I mean yeah, I've seen him go through just 5 roxies 15's in one day but I don't really know if he was that conservative that day when he said he was. It's conceivable... but not the point of this tale.

&nbsp;

His mother has bad knees and she has been prescribed various opioids for over a decade. I remember when she used to get vikes. Sometimes I'll hear Cliff's mom moan and demand or request ""something to take"" from Cliff. If he is honestly at the bottom of the barrel he'll ask me, ""do you have any ibuprofen or Tylenol?"" They've bought bottles of acetaminophen...who cares how it's spelled but they disappear in no time once either one of them runs out of roxies. 


So like, what's worse is... there are times where Cliff will get blues between script days so he'll give some to his mom to take.. but of course she usually takes 15mg roxies so he'll break the blue in half. Then she'll complain she only got half. It's tough. The other day she actually wanted a second goblin and Cliff was like ""you gotta wait for it to take effect"", in fact that was right after he gave his last legit scripted pill to her.

&nbsp;


Finally, this evening Cliff was telling me what he did earlier that day. First the light stuff, at some point days ago he gave his mom 4mg of Suboxone and she slept really well. Sleep is something that comes hard for her, and when she don't get sleep she might be miserable enough to bug Cliff about all manner of bullshit shenanigans. From food to bills. Heck, if Cliff is too lazy to get up and she gets up and falls.. that's a whole operation so a sleepy Cliff's mom usually results in an undisturbed Cliff.


&nbsp;

Oh my gosh, I still didn't get to the point!


Alright here goes.... Cliff told his mom that a bag of Heroin was ""pure oxy"" and told her she could take it one of two ways. She took it and said the oxy was really good, felt good, licked the pain and all. 


ughhh... oh my God, jeeze, fuck.. like really? I'm just flabbergasted here. If flabbergasted could make a sound that sounded like a stuttering platypus, that's sort of me right now while pronouncing the word flabbergasted.


I'm sorry if anyone was expecting more but um I'd say this at least suffices to tickle the WTF senses.",1524142934.0

I had the day off so that I could go to therapy and I figured I‚Äôd end the latest binge and get back on the right track. Went to therapy sick as fuck and left my phone in my car. When I came back out I had a message from ol‚Äô girl to come through and of course my addict brain said fuck everything lets get well. I picked up a friend and we drove to meet this chick. Long story short, we get to her around 4pm and we didn‚Äôt leave until about 7-7:30. Her plug had her driving all over the goddamn place while we waited at her house. I was going fucking nuts because at this point I was more fucking dopesick and losing my patience. This bitch  had us waiting at a gas station for an hour, then we had to drive 20 minutes to her apartment, and then we sat there for another two hours before ol middle girl finally came through. At that point I could‚Äôve just taken the sub and been fucking fine, but noooooooooo I‚Äôm a fucking dipshit. And then she comes back with some RP 30s (they‚Äôre legit but meh). I had heard that these were being pressed around here so I fucking get out my narcan as my friend fucking chews a whole one and I stay sick for another 15 or so minutes until I realize that she isn‚Äôt gonna fall out (I was driving so I didn‚Äôt wanna do one of mine and risk ODing). I‚Äôm a paranoid motherfucker.

Tl;dr was gonna get back on subs but didn‚Äôt and waited three ours to get 30s even though I could‚Äôve technically just taken it and said fuck the waiting game.

8ddqpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ddqpi/the_subway_station_christ/,5,https://redd.it/8ddqpi,Stadtmitte,The Subway Station Christ,"The first time that I walked through the (name redacted) subway station- back in my undergrad years before I had ever really seen heroin in the flesh, let alone having it become the focal point of my life- I was disgusted, unnerved, and mildly intrigued. The junkies panhandling there sat side by side, arms wrapped around bony knees, murmuring a small thanks anytime a passerby dropped a coin in their cups (always from a distance, as if to avoid catching whatever soul-disease they had). When the crowds were thin, they'd break out the foil and smoke their dope in the open. However, that was rare, and most of the time they would just sit in silent agony, sweating and stinking. When I passed by them on the way to school, I couldn't help but sneak a furtive glance, curious to see something that most people appeared to try not to look at. I vividly remember watching one pick up the stub of a cigarette to find it had some tobacco still packed in it.

How the hell could somebody do that to themselves? I wondered. I was no stranger to masochism, but the level of shamelessness and lack of fucks given by these homeless junkies exceeded anything I had ever seen. Most people ignored them, but there were plenty of dirty looks. Unfazed, the junkies held out their cups. They shot up and smoked up in front of kids, in front of elderly tourists. If the police came, they dragged their ragged asses up and away for about 15 minutes, then settled right back down. For all I know, they even slept there. Sleep, beg, dig through garbage, shoot up, repeat. What a life. Every day I passed by them, I sneaked a peek and imagined what they were thinking. When I became hooked myself, I understood completely. One day you're the master's student, the next you're living out of garbage cans.

Near the end of my study abroad semester, I was walking through the same station to go study for final exams. One of the regular junkies ‚Äì the one with the filthy long black corpse-hair and roman nose - sat in his usual spot, eating something no doubt dug out of the trash bin next to him. Two companions nodded off next to him, evidently having recently shot up. Above him, the electronic subway sign read in loud words ‚ÄúNo stops here today-- train driving through.‚Äù Some sort of maintenance on the line. This meant that, as opposed to the usual train rumbling to a slow stop to allow the passengers off, the train would barrel straight through the station onto the next one, fast as hell and loud as you can imagine. I always stood as far back as I could when the trains drove through, just an instinctual human reaction to stay the fuck back from theses steel beasts. You could really feel the power as they clanged and chugged and rumbled through- *don't fuck with me, i'll eat you up, step right up and see if you can stop me*! They flew by so fast you couldn't even make the individual cars up, making it look like one giant single machine. 
	

For the first time, when I was furtively staring at the junkies, he raised his eyes from the floor and met mine. I heard the rumbling from the depths of the tunnels behind me. The junkie's eyes were blue and wide and full of some sort of distant emotion- longing, maybe? Desire for something that doesn't exist, or maybe never did? He stared at me for a full 5 seconds, not blinking, not moving. The rumbling grew louder. Putting his mangy hands on the floor (I noticed he was missing a finger), he pushed, coming to a crouch and an unsteady stand. A rig dropped from his pocket. The rumbling came to a roar and my bones vibrated with the telltale sign of the train about to pass through the station. 

The junkie's expression changed in an instant- his eyes brightened, the ragged folds of his mouth curled to a soft smile, and his posture erect. He lost 10 years of age in a second. His sporadic teeth looked like tombstones in an ancient graveyard, but they accentuated his smile. I found myself unconsciously reaching for my wallet, feeling for some reason that I needed to give him cash, lots of it, maybe everything I had, because I KNEW he would use it to turn his life around, that he would clean up and settle down and come back to life, I could help him, that he would change the world with his greatness. What I felt in him was something so powerful, so compelling, that this one smile would lead to two lives changed- his getting clean, and me finding whatever fulfillment I was seeking and conquering whatever loneliness that filled my life. I felt my life in his smile. 

I opened my mouth to ask him his name when he stepped forward. He walked slowly, erect, Christlike. He brushed me aside, focusing on something behind me. He hadn't even seen me at all. He took another step forward. The train emerged, flying with reckless abandon from the far end of the tunnel. The junkie smile and stepped forward off the edge of the platform as the train barreled through, the smile never leaving his face.

When I first tried heroin, much later, his face came to mind. 4 years later and that junkie is me, and you can be damned sure that this ""opting-out,"" the quickest way out of addiction, just a train-station away, is always and forever at the back of my mind.

So I know that Narcan, when administered, blocks the opiate receptors in the brain from the opiates you've taken...But that doesn't mean it gets completely rid of the opiates in your system, right? 

Along with this I know after someone is given Narcan that they can go into immediate opiate withdrawal, which makes me more confused as to if Narcan just completely rids your body of all opiates...???

What I mean is, for example, if someone does heroin and is overdosing and given Narcan, it will block the opiate receptors in the brain but the heroin would still be detectable in their system for the normal amount of time heroin is detectable, right? 

I simply cannot imagine that an OD antidote would be able to just instantly get rid of any trace of opiate in your system.

I've spent the better part of fifteen years either waiting on the d-boy or being harassed by junkies waiting on me to *be* the d-boy. I've done it in rain, sleet, snow, blizzards, more than one hurricane, on both coasts, in the concrete metropolises of the North and in the toothless-ness of the rural South. And because this, apparently, is the kind of knowledge I have that I can pass along to the next generation, here I am. At least until they let me give this talk to kindergartners (again) or offer Junkie 101 at the community college.

We're gonna talk about three things: What to Do, How to Do It, and What Not to Do. My goal is to make this as easy as possible and instill a sense of confidence in the people who think copping drugs is too hard or too dangerous. If anyone has anything to add please chime in and I'll add it to post. I'd like this to be a community effort that, in the spirit of harm reduction, can help people stay safe in what is one of the less dangerous, but more nerve-wracking, parts of addiction.

#What to Do

There are a few ways to cop your drug of choice, but they all basically break down to one of two ways: open-air shopping or using a middleman.

Of the two, open-air markets are the logistically easier, but psychologically harder of the two. Most of the time just living in a city will make you familiar with the ""bad part of town."" When it isn't obvious which neighborhoods are shitty just Google for heroin busts, prostitution arrests, violent crime, and the like.

Once you know where you're doing you need to know what to do. For that I invite you to the next section.

The second method - using a middle - is less psychologically taxing than doing the dirt yourself, but presents it's own unique challenges. Of these, the one most posted is, of course, *""How do I find a middle?""* You're obviously looking for an entree into the world of degeneracy, so let me ask - if you're looking for a junkie, where would you find them?

Narcotics Anonymous meetings are a sure-fire way to meet junkies and methadone/Suboxone clinics are, by definition, full of people currently skull fucked on various poppy-related products. The downside here is, obviously, these are places where people go to get help with their addictions and while, yes, you're looking for help too it's kinda in the opposite direction of the help generally offered in these locales. If you can square it with your conscience then these are places full of helpful junkies... *Who you're going to drag back into the gutter, you horrible, horrible human being.* (Kidding... Well, mostly kidding.)

As mentioned by /u/billinsandiego, a good number of people attending AA/NA meetings are there because it's court ordered (Obviously, since each is independent, this depends on the meeting - location, time, etc.) Also, traditionally while you may be called out in the room and asked to leave, it's unlikely that law enforcement would be called for anything short of disrupting the meeting. Law enforcement, in general, leave the rooms alone because it's viewed as a helpful tool in helping people get clean. (In other words don't stand up and say, *""Hi, my name is Needa Hookuplz and I'm looking for a hook-up... Please.""* Try to be a bit smoother than that.) Finally, to increase your odds of finding a middle while expanding your network of fellow addicts it pays to look for meetings with a featured guest speaker as opposed to the normal, more casual meetings. *(Thanks /u/billinsandiego.)*

Aside from a junkie-buddy, your next option is going to be finding a more tertiary introduction. Homeless dudes literally live on the street and they know it better than you know the layout of your living room. Asking one for help finding street-based degeneracy is like asking a fish to find water. Prostitutes are in the same boat, albeit their's is more *Love Boat* and less refugee raft made of old oil drums and desperation. As a bonus, the homeless and the professionals are less likely to try and bleed you slow as a price for middling - but that's discussed below.

Prostitutes bring us to the newest (and most likely filled with bullshit and scams) way to find what you're looking for - the internet. Setting aside Dark Net Markets (which have been written about before by people much, much smarter than me - check out /r/darknetmarketsnoobs as a starting point; thanks to /u/spiritualasf for reminding me about that subreddit) you can use Craigslist, Backpage, and other internet classifies-style sites to find not only professional women but also, using the correct search terms, legit dealers.

*(I'm not 100% sure on what all the common drug-related search terms are, so if anyone would like to help me out with a list, I'd appreciate it. Also maybe a list of the most common drug-scams? This is out of my wheelhouse. Thanks.)*

#What Not to Do

Okay, so you've found a shitty 'hood. You've got money, transportation, and a need that can only to be filled with suspicious powders. So it's time to trade that money for those powders.

A lot of what I'm about to say is a mixture of common sense and street smarts. The next section, What Not to Do, will detail the Don'ts so you can avoid getting robbed, scammed, hurt, or arrested. This section is more the prototypical what I'd tell the nervous hood newbie before sending him out to sink or swim.

First, you need to know your local slang for the drug you want. Asking for *""One heroin please!""* is a good way to get your pockets ran. When I first moved to Chicago I had no idea what the fuck *""blows""* were - I always thought blow equaled coke - and correcting them by saying, *""No, I need a gram of heroin,""* had me turned away a few times before I caught on.

If you're in a car (which I highly recommend until you have more experience with the area) make the block once or twice to, hopefully, catch anything untoward - parked police cruisers, vacant-eyed creepy children, eldritch aliens, whatever. Once you're comfortable, pull up, locked doors, only the driver's window down, and place your order.

Some sets do hand-to-hands - money-to-drugs - some will have you give your cash to one guy and get your dope from another, hell, some might have fucking delivery pigeons. For the most part, however, it will happen in one stop, one transaction. Being asked to hand over the cash, pull away/make the block/part over there, isn't unheard of, but unless I knew that's how the set operated I never let my money walk more than a few feet away. Once that cash is in their hands it's theirs - ain't like you can co complain to a cop. Keep that in mind.

But, more importantly, is to remember that they're running a business. Unhappy customers don't come back, so burning you once for $100 is worth way less than someone coming back regularly. That's not to be said it never happens, so be cognizant of the situation around you. Avoid buying from single individuals - try to buy from a full-on set at a corner or on a stoop; don't fuck with randoms walking around. People alone could be hooked into a crew, or the could be freelancers - or they could be looking for an easy mark - while dudes sitting around in a group are obviously organized and doing more serious dirt then Scruffy Jimmy just ambling around.

Lastly - get a phone number from them. Calling ahead to make sure they're on can save you a ton of bullshit. Bullshit which could lead you to making poor decisions in the name of trying to make something happen. Pro-tip: avoid all possible flavors and varieties of bullshit.

Being on foot has many of the same considerations as copping in a car, just with the tension upped a bit. You'll still need to have your entry and exit planned - including alternate routes. You still need to carry the minimum cash necessary. I'd only take my ID, cash, and burner phone. Keep your cash somewhere secure, but easy to get to. You don't want to fumble around in a wallet while your dealer is looking at you like the world's saddest moron. Like I've said, Street Shit 101.

Exiting the area is the same on foot as it is in a car. Get in, cop, get out. Don't stop a block away to fix in your car or shoot up in an alley. You just open yourself up to getting harassed by the desperate or despicable - homeless and cops, respectively. Get home before you fix, but if you absolutely can't wait, well, sorry, but fixing in public is beyond the scope of this guide.

Lastly, let's talk about getting stopped. While I've seen and used a ton of ways to mitigate this eventuality (because it *will* happen, eventually) and dealing with the police is something every criminal needs to know how to do - and, ideally, do well - the fact is that being in a shitty neighborhood isn't a crime. The easiest way to avoid getting arrested after buying drugs is to not do anything illegal... Well, anything *else,* I suppose.

In other words, keep your papers (license, insurance, registration, and tag) up to date. Have no rigs, straws, cookers, or other paraphernalia in your car. Assume that if it's hidden, no matter how well, it can be found - because it can. And as much as it sucks, at the end of the day, swallowing your drugs is *way* better than catching a charge. *(And yes, CPD, I'm still pissed about needing to swallow that dope on fucking Christmas Eve, you holly, jolly, Christmas-ruining fucks.*) I keep an open 20 oz. bottle of coke exactly for this reason.

*An aside here - I've had the debate of hidden versus trashed way too many times. If you've got faith that your boy-pussy won't be probed, then, by all means store whatever you want in your sin cave. I'd rather just re-buy my dope than risk it, but hey, you do you... And do that boy-pussy goooood.*

Okay, so that's how you conduct yourself in an open-air market, but what are the niceties in dealing with a middle? We've talked about *where* and *how* to find them but what do you do once one if on the hook?

First off - felonies aren't free. It might cost you ten bucks or ten thousand. They might want you to buy them their own bag, or a rock, or a bottle. The point is that be ready to pay them for their help. It might be a tricky issue to breach, but talking upfront about what they're expecting will leave both parties in a better position. Overpay, underpay, haggle - do whatever you want, but be ready to pay *something.*

Buying their connect - outright paying for an introduction - is almost always going to be easier and cheaper in the long run. You'll pay less, over time, but more importantly you'll never be on Middle-man Time. (Just Dealer-Time, but that's something else.) They might balk, but offering more cash or threatening to walk away is an easy way to call the bluff. Damn near every dealer in the world wants more customers. Just taking the number (off their phone or yours if they use it) works but so does tire iron applied to a kneecap - like I've said, you do you.

That being said... 

Never let your money walk. If it's too good to be true it probably is. Never put more money in their hand than you're comfortable losing. Never let them discuss the deal with you able to hear at least their side of the conversation. Never let them handle the dope without you watching. If they're sick don't trust a single word they say. Spend every minute thinking about how they could fuck you - because I guarantee they're thinking of the perfect way to bend you over. As above - Hood Shit 101. I could give you a dissertation on street smarts, but, really, you either get it or you don't. Everyone gets taken a few times at first - they're just expensive lessons.

#What Not to Do

Above all I want to say this - if you're scared to cop because you think you'll ""be robbed"" or ""thrown in jail"" then you should really reevaluate whether or not drugs are a good hobby for you. *(Also it's kinda racist that you think just because you're a honky in the hood you're gonna get mugged or jammed up by 12.)* Ninety-nine times out of a hundred dealers are just dudes trying to make ends meet. In other words, they're people - just like me and thee.

That being said, there are ways to avoid being a victim of that last one percent. Be respectful, direct, and distantly polite. Make eye contact but don't stare. Carry yourself like you have a reason to be there. Don't dress overly flashy or carry expensive shit - purses, jewelry, phones. Don't *ever* talk shit because there is always someone willing to cash that check. Obviously, if you're white, don't say racist shit. *(The number of newbies I've seen that thought they could say ""Nigga"" in a roomfuls of bangers is stupidly high.)* Don't ask questions about their operation, their set, or how they function. Don't use overly precise terminology since it seems cop-ish and makes people nervous. Don't carry a weapon because it escalates the situation, any possible criminal charges, and you're way more likely to get hurt if you have one. *(You are not Rambo or John Wick. You're reading an internet guide about how to buy drugs on the street for Mother Morphine's sake. If anything screams, ""I don't need to a carry a gun"" more than that, I'll be fucked if I know what it is.)*

Just don't act like a tourist and, most likely, you'll be fine.

#Expanded, Additional Points

**- Copping As a Female**

While I'm not a woman, I've had a few junkie lovers and a few platonic female friends so I can draw from their experiences.

Being female changes the situation some, and in some pretty significant ways, but the base calculus mostly remains the same. Some dealers/middles might offer to trade drugs for sexual favors. It's depressingly common, and most prostitutes I've known started out pimped by their significant other or by preforming their first commercial sex acts with their dealers.

Some people might be more protective of females. As the risk of sounding like a racist *(build der wall, ya'll - /s)* Mexicans culture has a ton of extra machismo lying around and I've seen that translated as a degree of extra respect towards and protection for women. Take that statement with a grain of salt.

A female will get a harder look from a cop than a man, but the cop is less likely to push the issue and let you go. Searching/dealing with chicks is different and requires resources which might not be readily available.

The dangers largely remain the same, but with the added danger of sexual violence. The trade-off is that violence against a woman, or scamming a woman, is a bit rarer than against a man. That plus being able to more easily approach other women (minus prostitutes - they're easier to approach as a dude) and the added arsenal of feminine wiles - if one chooses to employ them - would make copping, in my opinion, easier for a chick than a man.

My biggest piece of advice to a female junkie would be this: be leery of accepting favors, freebies, or fronts from a dealer. Maybe he's just a cool dude doing you a solid, or maybe he's looking to get repaid in a way you might not be cool with. Just something to consider.

*(this section was added based on the question and recommendation of /u/ak47revolver9. i should have considered the difference between the sexes in the original post. thank you, ak.)*


**- A Final Note on Middles.**

The chief rule to remember when working with a middle is that, *They are not your friend.* Maybe they will be, one day, but until that chilly day in Hell they are, most likely, just working the calculus on fucking you over. Hell, even if they're a friend they're probably still doing that math.

Remember - you're subsiding for their habit. Would you want to give up working with someone who's paying you to cop dope when you were already going to cop dope? Nope - me either, so they really won't want let you go once you're on the hook. 

Be prepared that if they don't want to play ball and sell you the connect's information or you can't find a way to get the number yourself, then it's time to break out the big boy panties and act like you belong in the hood. Walk up with your middle once the transaction has been talked about on the phone. Refuse to let your money walk even a few feet away. Don't let them discuss the deal outside of earshot and never let the middle handle the drugs. Don't buy into the line, *""My guy don't like meeting new people,""* because I've never seen a dealer who's good with turning away customers. Explain to your middle that things can be done your way, and he can get a little something, or he can try to fuck you around until you tell him to kick rocks and then he gets nothing. There's always another middle.

Like I said - wear them big boy panties and act like you belong on these streets.

*(Thanks to /u/Mu_Kappa_Delta for pointing out that getting the middle out of the picture as fast as possible is almost always the best practice.)*


#Last Words

This isn't meant to be the end-all, be-all, dogmatic how-to guide to buy drugs. These are my personal recommendations based on personal experience, things I've seen, junkie camp-fire stories, and dope-fiend Apocrypha. For every person buying, selling, or middling dope there's a different way to do it. As long as you don't end up hurt, robbed, or arrested you've done it right.

I'm happy to answer any questions, expand on any of this, or incorporate any good points or suggestions into the body of the post. As comments and discussion come in I'l update this post, and thanks to everyone who's helped with comments, suggestions, and critiques.

I never expected an an answer but after wading through a whole bunch of offers for sex, I finally found a guy who was willing to help.

Got a full bottle of 55 Norcos. Only 5 mg, but anything is better than nothing. My pain is coming down, and I'm finally able to relax. And the best part? Guy gave me the bottle for FREE. He was just a genuinely nice guy who wanted to help.

Not sure if that counts as a junkie Jesus moment, but he was definitely JJ in disguise to me.

Back in November I got arrested and charged with forgery (a class C felony in the US) and possession of stolen property (a misdemeanor in the US). I am a first time offender. I have been able to get the misdemeanor charge dropped, but am still facing charges for forgery. 
My lawyer tried to get me diversion through the prosecuting attorneys office but I was rejected from entering the program. 
At this point, there's a possibility I will get the chance to get the opportunity to do drug court. Drug court is a 12-24 month program where you have to submit to weekly monitored UAs, have a nightly curfew, have to live in halfway or sober housing, have a mandatory minimum amount of meetings to attend, have to appear in court weekly, and must be attending treatment (inpatient, intensive outpatient, and then outpatient). During your weekly court date if you have any violations you will face jail time. A lot of people end up spending 24 months in the drug court program and end up serving more time than if they would have just pled guilty. If you don't successfully complete drug court you get the maximum penalty allowed by law for your crime. For me that would be up to 10 years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines. If you do successfully complete drug court, you are not convicted of your crime.
My other option is to see what kind of deal I can get for pleading guilty. I'd have to take the felony  conviction for forgery but I would serve probably 90 days at the most... I could potentially get away with not doing any more jail time at all, and just spend time on probation.

Anyone have any input/feedback for me? ",1524088974.0

I smoked a bit in the morning until I was feeling pretty good then did a tiny little bit bigger shot then I normally do and I immediately felt it. I was struggling to keep my eyes open to rinse my rig out and when I was done and ended up throwing up afterwards and was on the floor of my bathroom nodding out over the toilet bowl for a good 20 minutes or so. Then afterwards I had a gnarly headache and I was puking periodically throughout the day. And this was like a migraine type headache too it was awful.

I usually practice excellent harm reduction techniques and am able to register on the first poke. 
Unfortunately, due to a combination of not being able to make it to the needle exchange last week and missing my shot because I was in a rush to do it in a public bathroom, I ended up with an abscess. 
In the past I've missed a few shots here and there and ended up with a pretty angry feeling lump for a few days that ends up going away on its own. Not this time! I got a lump where I missed my shot and it got more swollen, red, and painful as the days went by until it caught the attention of a medical professional. I  convinced the doctor that it wasn't *that* bad but he told me if it got any worse to get medical attention.
Of course, my abscess continued to get worse until I couldn't take it anymore and went to have it looked at. On Sunday I had to have it ""lanced"" and ""drained"". (By ""lanced"" I mean they used a scalpel to make about a half inch long incision. By ""drained"" I mean the doctor squeezed the abscess with every ounce of strength she had, and then proceeded to use tweezers, the scalpel, and god-knows-what-else to root around under my skin to find more places to squeeze.) Once the doctor was satisfied, the incision was then packed with some gross yellow antibacterial fabric. Finally, I was prescribed a week of antibiotics and advised to have my dressing changed daily at any urgent care or emergency room until further notice. 
""Until further notice""... Hmm... Interesting word choice, right? Let me explain what that apparently meant... ""Until further notice"" meant that even though I think I'm getting my dressing repacked and changed, I am actually probably going to be getting my arm scalpeled open and violently drained until further notice. Yep, I've had the same abscess cut to pieces, squeezed, poked, and prodded for the last 3 days straight. It doesn't get any less painful either. I can't wait until this thing can start healing!

So what's the moral of the story? Don't ever compromise your safety by not practicing excellent harm reduction techniques. 

Anyone else have some abscess stories to share to make me feel less gross right now? ",1524086139.0

Tired of feeling like absolute dog shit half of the time and feeling great about 10% of the time. Tired of needing something to get through a 9-hour shift at whatever restaurant I‚Äôm cooking at (and barely keeping my job).

Now if people are going to continue to use something that they know could be dangerous, they owe it to themselves to be as safe as possible. ODs happen because there are no stardizations in potency, and this is especially true today on the streets. However, risk can be minimized through my friends solutions and dilutions. 

There are right ways to dilute things and wrong ways. The reason so many people die is because of the latter. 

While, as a user, you don't have control over the intelligence of others, you can minimize your risk of OD drastically and systymatically.

Even if the fent cut is applied properly, it is best to always assume it could very well be deadly. That is to say you should assume every powder contains various hotspots and varying potencies.

Now know it or not, it's possible you could already be very familure with dilution processe(s). When people dissolve compounds(solute) in solution(solvent like water) this a dilution. Essentially you are making a more concentrated product into to something more uniform and diluted. This is where the safety, metaphorical, key lies.

Note: this assumes the fent or analogues are in the hydrocloride salt form. It's also important to note that this will not cause you to lose any product or have any negative effects. It is in you best interest.

The thing that people do wrong, when performing their personal dilutions, is that they are diluting with far too little solvent. Safe practices include: 

And btw, preferably you need a couple oral syringes (1ml, 5ml, 10ml) and some marked, sealed containers (like water bottles), but this can be done without precision, because it is a dilution. That's to say you can dilute the water by eye; doubling the water volume each time.

-In order to minimize the variation in dosing, all of your product needs to be applied to a large volume of solvent (water).
-I cannot give you exact amounts because each will have varying strength, in addition to tolerance 
-you could end up with a few very weak solutions, however nothing is lost, water can be evaporated off, and it's better than death.

1. Cover your solute (powder) completely with water (inside container). It is important that you are doing this to the entirety of your purchase. Now shake / wait until complelty disolved. If you don't have precise measuring tools, go with a larger volume over a smaller one. This first container is your √ó1 potency baseline.

2. If you have the precision, measure the volume of liquid. (Oral syringes are very precise; the smaller the better, measuring cups are not very precise; but better than nothing). Take 1/4 the liquid out from the first container and add it to the second container. Add the same volume of liquid that was in the first container, to the 2nd container.

3. Repeat step 2 as needed. But step 3 should be within safety margins (tread carefully). If so e correctly this should be 1/16 the potency of the the first bottle. Now test your solutions with an oral syringe. Going by .1 ml incriments, and tolerating up your dose until you find the right active dosage for you as an individual. You can then convert your remaining solutions to the desired potencily.

Went a little overboard this month, and it's guaranteed I am going to run out of opiates about 10-12 days before my next refill...

I REFUSE TO BREAK THE LAW, and I am going to enter WDs in a few days, what steps can I legally take to avoid the WDs? I honestly could care less if I get high, I just need to avoid the WDs until the beginning of May so I can work each day. What are my legally-viable options for completely avoiding the WDs?

- Urgent care? Obviously urgent care wont give me more opiates, nor should urgent care give me more opiates. Would there be any reason to visit an urgent care?

- Emergency room? Several months ago a nurse at my pain clinic told me if I ever lose my opiates while traveling, I should visit the ER. I never did ask the nurse why I would visit the ER first, but that was the recommendation of a nurse at my pain clinic. If I visit an ER while in the middle of WDs what can I expect from the typical ER? What would an ER even do for me? Once again, I am not looking for more opiates. I dont want to get high. I just need to avoid the WDs until the beginning of May so I can work each day.

Contact my pain clinic? If so, what do I tell them? ""Oh by the way, I took more of my meds than I am suppose to, and ran out of my meds too quickly, can you help me with the WDs?"" Such a statement to my pain clinic sounds like a horrible idea. So, if I contacted my pain clinic, what should I tell them? I've been going to the same pain clinic for a couple of years, and I've never made a strange request from them before. I have a good relationship with my pain doctor.

What other suggestions do you have for someone to legally avoid WDs who is going to come up short by about 10 ten days before they get their meds legally filled again?

A few things to note:
- I have an ample supply of klonazapam, ativan and xanax available to me, although I have a high tolerance to all three.

- I have a large supply of lyrica.

Make no mistake though, I am going into WDs in a few days.  The above drugs may help around the edges, but I need to find a legally-viable way to completely avoid the WDs so I dont lose my damn job!  Any and all recommendations will be greatly appreciated.  :)",1524047235.0

- imodium (loperamide)
- source to cop more benzos and subs and stims

Help me schedule when to start my subs out (if i run out, i have source to get street subs so it's ok with the limited supply) and gather resources and check if i'm missing anything i can easily get before i get uber sick, because that bun and a half i did is holding me off right now, I'm surprisingly not physically sick yet, at least not to the noticeable amount where I start complaining.

I wish I can go to a medically supervised detox setting inpatient program. I can't cause my permanent residence status is not yet granted so I don't have any insurance nor am eligible for any. I just simply cannot afford it financially anymore to support me and my wife's habit and since my wife left to detox, I'm going to be kicking this alone at home.

Oh, and my 2 class C felony for CPCS (criminal possession of controlled substance) dropped down to Class A misdemeanors and has been put on ACD (adjournment in contemplation of dismissal) so what that means is it's all going to get dismissed in September if I don't get arrested until then.

That's just an update since I remember posting about it a few months ago but back then it was still felony charges. How stupid.

I really am coming to grips with what i experienced and who i became while on drugs, i have had clean time before but it never felt like this.

This compound was sold under the name of 2-Me-MAF; a close relative of another potent fentanyl analogue which had recently been banned in China, known as methoxyacetylfentanil or MAF. At first the users reported it to be similar to MAF in potency and euphoria, just another of many delicious analogues available to opioid RC enthusiasts. Ten thousand strong doses for less than a hundred dollars.  

A couple more months passed and suddenly there were reports of the new batches of 2-Me-MAF being unlike those previous. Some wouldn't dissolve in water. Some had no effect at all. Many users reported their product did have an effect: a horrific and stimulating psychedelic trip, probably courtesy of kappa receptor agonism. Our beloved mu-opioid receptor mediates euphoria and gives us reason to throw our lives away for heroin, while its sister the kappa-opioid receptor mediates dysphoria. One user had their order of 2-Me-MAF sent off a toxicology lab to be quantified; the result confirmed the sole presence of 2-methyl-methoxyacetylfentanil.  Perhaps the euphoric batches of 2-Me-MAF had in fact been old MAF stock, too valuable to just be thrown away when the government prohibited its manufacture. Who knows.  

Onwards to my question: it's old news that fentanyl analogues can be purchased through Chinese wholesalers. Low-level dealers are aware of this, and I assume 2-Me-MAF has already made its way to the street as an aduterant in heroin, terrorizing everyone it meets.  

Yet I haven't seen any reports on unpleasant psychedelic heroin, so I'm asking here: does anyone know what I'm talking about? Have you taken heroin tainted with this chemical, or heard from somebody who has?",1524037654.0

I discovered pain pills, and soon after I was shooting smack. He was curious, so I allowed him to try it. At this point we're doing what we've always done, just taking a lot of breaks to inject a lot of drugs. We even went to college together. Two weeks into college though, I overdosed and almost died, when he found me and did CPR and helped my breathing while he called the paramedics. 
Now we are both (mostly) sober. We still smoke weed and drink occasionally, and we both hang out and drink Kratom sometimes, but my family is NOT comfortable with me being near him. They fear that I will relapse and die. 
I feel like I owe him the respect to not just abandon him. He is my best friend, after all. Is my family right? Would it be healthy to just drop him and stop speaking to him at all?
Thanks y'all",1524036122.0

Not sure if anyone else experiences this, but I have been using oxy/xanax for months, and recently have been seeing dark spots develop on my face, mainly inbetween my eyes on the bridge of my nose. 

They basically come after I black out/take alot of both xans and oxy. They start out looking like sun burns and develop into dark spots since I am darker skinned. I have a streak above my eyebrow since October that will not go away. Another streak went away and it was symmetrical to the one that has not gone away.

Any creams or solutions to get rid of these skin problems? After a binge my nose is peeling and my skin looks like shit with these dark splotches. Anyone else experience this?",1524035733.0

I can't stop listening to his music lately. I'm in that sober phase where music is so powerful and emotional. I'm a musician anyway and when I'm high I let the music die. It's sad.

8d3ctu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8d3ctu/a_trip_on_the_7_train/,15,https://redd.it/8d3ctu,doobiousdoob,A trip on the 7 train.,"I‚Äôm sick as a dog it took me forever to get to the subway even tho it‚Äôs a short 10 minute walk, it felt like a life time. I meet my girl at the subway transfer from the n to the 7  to pick up money. I had Venmod her money so she could take it out of the bank for Me, long ago my accounts had been charged off after I Over drew them into oblivion.  She wanted to know what it was for...she doesn‚Äôt know I use heroin and I came up with a corny excuse I think she bought it but I didn‚Äôt care at that moment if she did or didn‚Äôt. She didn‚Äôt kiss me goodbye when we went our separate ways...I knew she was mad and I don‚Äôt blame her. But I can‚Äôt even begin to deal with that now...I have one thing on my mind...getting on that 7 train. 

I was lucky enough to catch an express...2 stops instead of 8. I still had a 20 minute walk after I got off and that‚Äôs walking at a normal pace which I was not...It was an 8 minute ride from start to finish it felt like a decade but finally my train dropped me off at my desired location. I was so close but still so far away.  A one mile walk sick  I would never make it. My legs were cramping my nose was dripping and I was sweating but freezing all at once.

I begrudgingly walked down the steps of the platform to the street below. Taxis lined the street waiting for a customer. I counted my money and decided fuck it I‚Äôm taking a taxi. 35 minutes turned into 4 and all of a sudden sweet relief was walking its way towards me with a grin on its face. My cabby was waiting around the corner for me.  I knew I could walk it back, once I was well it wouldn‚Äôt be the slightest issue but it was still cold out and I just wanted to get back to my 7 train. 

Just like that I was walking back to the cab rolling the bundle between my fingers. I find it funny that until i get these little baggies up my nose I will not relinquish my grip on the bundle, it‚Äôs not to leave my hand until I start to open them. I hop back in the car and tell my cabby to take me back to the train. I lay my phone out and immediately start opening and pouring 4 bags out. I move them into 3-4 lines, grab the straw from my pocket never being more careful than I was at that moment not to spill my
Precious cargo laid out on the screen of my phone. Day in and day out bags poured out onto my phone waiting for me to put them up my nose.  

In an instant I feel 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 110, 200% better. as each second passes my body returns to normal. It‚Äôs actually kind of sad.  My cabby asks me if I just bought weed as I clean up my supplies in his back seat. I laugh and simply say ‚ÄúNo, I wish man I wish.‚Äù If only it were as simple as weed. 

We make it back to the subway and I pay my partner in crime who  I volunteered without his knowledge. I thank him for the ride and exit the car.  Gone are the sweats and the muscle cramps and I‚Äôm not even cold any more as I have that amazing fire burning on the inside keeping me warm. Just as my other symptoms immediately subsided my appetite quickly returned and i decided to spend my last $2 on 2 shitty McDonald‚Äôs cheeseburgers... but alas the 7 train awaited me.  The climb up the stairs this time was effortless I could have taken them 2 at a time if I desired but I decided to walk like a normal person. There would Be no express train on the return trip. As it only runs express towards the city during the morning commute. This time it would be 10 stops back but for all I cared it could have been 100 stops. As the train pulls away I don‚Äôt focus on each and every stop like I did on the way here. Now I allow my self to become consumed in my phone and before you know it I‚Äôm back where I had met my girl an hour prior... as I boarded the N and headed towards my Final destination 5 stops to go, feeling so much better than I did on my way. i couldn‚Äôt help but look across the tracks imagining sick me coming back this way only an hour prior. The difference was astounding. And it Instantly disgusted me. My daily trips on the 7 train. Heading out sick and heading home happy.  I can‚Äôt get over that, and  it eats at me, atleast it does for now. Until tomorrow when I head out sick going from the N to the 7 to a taxi and back all over again.  I feel like this is my own personal  groundhogs day. And there seems to be no escape. Until tomorrow 7 train. Until tomorrow 

 
(This was my first attempt at writing a story I hope it was ok and possibly entertaining for atleast one of you. I know I always enjoyed people‚Äôs stories about picking up. So i decided I would share it. Hope u guys enjoy)

All fentanyl warnings are flaired as such and archived, so you can search for them by [clicking here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/search?q=flair%3Afent+warning&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) Reddit's search is not that great and it does not list them chronologically either, so the list below is still the best.

Here are some things to remember about heroin/fentanyl dope mix:

* You can purchase fentanyl test strips at [this site for $10.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/) They detect the presence of even the smallest amount of fentanyl and they will detect a good number of the fentanyl analogues as well. Is your life worth $10? You can't get high again if you are dead!

* There is no way you can be sure the powder you have been given does not contain fentanyl without testing, and there is no simple, fool proof method for checking it yourself besides the [linked test strips.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)

* Just because it looks, smells, tastes, and is chunky like good clean heroin doesn't mean there is not fentanyl in it and that it's not deadly.

* Be aware of pills that you are buying as well, it is getting more and more common to see numerous imprints of pills that are being counterfeited with an unknown amount of fentanyl in them. There are some very good fakes going around out there that will fool even the most seasoned pill user.

* Just because there is not a warning in your area it does not mean there is not fentanyl tainted dope around. Be safe, start small, use with a friend, have Narcan on hand, and **do test shots!**

* Be safe, be smart, start small, use with a friend, have Narcan on hand, and **do test shots!**

Ever since, weed has been ruined and that was about 4 years ago now. I do use them everyday after work. It might sound dumb but I have a personal rule where I won't get high until 5:00 or later if I'm still at work. I never work while high. I redose once at 8:00 or 9:00 and will very rarely redose for a second time. I never go more than a few weeks at a time without taking a tolerance break so that I don't become too physically dependent. I don't enjoy any other drug at all really and I have no intention of stopping anytime soon. I don't see anything wrong with my drug use as it's not hurting anyone else, it doesn't get in the way of my responsibilities. Addiction and health issues aside, I see my drug use no different than someone who get's stoned or has a few drinks every night. The concept is the same. ",1524009452.0

So I am a trained phlebotomist which if you don‚Äôt know is somebody that taps veins and draws blood all day long. Below is a list of tips you should ALWAYS follow when shooting to preserve your veins, heart, and avoiding infection. 


CLEANLINESS/ STAYING STERILE:

Before beginning your session, always make sure that your hands are WASHED CLEAN and that the area that you will be having your substances and rigs is clean as well. 
Please I cannot stress this enough, use a brand new needle every time. Do not ever share needles with anybody else as well.  You can purchase them on Amazon as I‚Äôve been told and other places ESPECIALLY veterinarian websites online in bulk for cheap. Some states actually allow you to purchase them for insulin without a prescription. There‚Äôs no reason you should be using dull needles.
Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab, rub the swab in a circular motion for 15 seconds. It should be 70% alcohol or higher.

MICRON FILTERS MICRON FILTERS MICRON FILTERS They are very cheap online and they are lifesavers. No excuse to not have them! They will SAVE your limbs and we all like those don‚Äôt we? 
THESE ARE ESSENTIAL!!!


 NEEDLES:

Use a new needle every single time if you can as the sharper the needle, the less tissue damage but if you absolutely cannot, then use it only up to 4 to 5 times tops if your budget is tight. This is because the duller the needle gets, the more damage and scarring it will cause to your veins that is irreparable and nobody WANTS track marks. This is KEY to keeping your skin and veins in as good as a condition as you can while shooting. You wouldn‚Äôt even know I shot by the looks of my arms. 

If you do reuse a needle rinse it and sterilize it if possible you can boil them in hot water on the stove. If you cannot boil it, make sure you thoroughly rinse it and store it with the cap on in a sterile place. Bleach is just as effective if not more!! May even be as easier option to you depending on your circumstance. 

Use the smallest gauge needle that you possibly can. This will obviously cause the least amount of damage and frankly pain.

And obviously before administration, make sure all air bubbles are removed my tapping the side of the syringe and pushing the remaining air out with the plunger.

FINDING A VEIN:

Stay away from veins in your feet, 

Constantly rotate the sites that you use. It is not smart to keep going up or down a vein a half an inch and shooting multiple times in that area. You should let it rest and use a different spot.

Try to use your ante cubital which is the center vein in the ditch of your arm. If not, use any vein that is large and easily accessible. 

Veins feel like a garden hose. They should be a little bouncy to the touch. You should palpate for a vein with just one finger. Once you have found a good one it‚Äôs time to get blood flowing into that arm so you can tourniquet it. 

When tourniquetting, the rule of thumb is *4-6 inches* above the injection site. Make it so that you can remove the tourniquet while injecting. I do this by having the end of it in my mouth or having a belt wrapped around under my thigh and up and over my arm and doing it that way. This is important so that you can relieve pressure before you take the needle out. 

Make sure the bevel of the needle which is the pointed opening is FACING UPWARDS!!
This is proper practice and less damaging to veins. 
In other words when you are putting the needle into your skin, you should be able to see the opening of the needle. It should be facing the sky so that the most pointed part of the needle is inserted first.

If you think you are in a vein and did not register, DO NOT DIG AROUND!!
 Pull the needle completely out, get the air out, and attempt again. I CANNOT stress this enough!! This causes major scarring and damage to your veins and it is called raking. NO GOOD. 
Think of it as taking a knife and cutting up your veins. Don‚Äôt do it because you think it will be quicker. Eventually you won‚Äôt be able to use that site because of practices like this.

If you are using veins on your forearm that tend to roll you can use your tourniquet above the site as well as one below to keep the vein from rolling or if you have a friend, they may apply pressure to the other side as well with two fingers. 

Drinking water will help keep your veins open and more easily accessible so make sure to drink water and keep hydrated always. This is honestly a huge huge tip especially for people with smaller veins and people that don‚Äôt drink enough water. Even after one day you will see a difference. 



SHOOTING:

Once you have registered, pull back slowly (this is important) and inject an amount, register again and pull the plunger back to make sure you are STILL in the vein and finish the injection. This is also a ridiculously important part. You will be able to feel if you are not in the vein. It will have a slight resistance to the injection and tends to burn or hurt. You are highly unlikely to get an abscess if you register a couple times ensuring that you are in the vein as well as following the cleanliness steps. 

As you are pushing the plunger in for the last injection, you should be removing the tourniquet at this point. You MUST leave the needle in before you take the tourniquet off so that pressure is not shooting towards the injection site. This WILL cause bruising and hematomas. 

AFTER THE SHOT:

Once you have removed the tourniquet, slowly remove the needle and have a paper towel or tissue ready to place MODERATE pressure on the site for a least a minute. This will prevent brusing. 

** A COMMON MISCONCEPTION **
DO NOT BEND YOUR ARM IF YOU INJECTED IN THE DITCH RIGHT AFTER. HOLD YOUR ARM STRAIGHT UP WITH APPLIED PRESSURE.
Bending your arm actually opens up the small puncture you made in the vein more as the vein moves. 

Put on a bandaid with a fresh piece of rolled up paper towel under it so it applies pressure for an hour or so and enjoy your high! 

If you experience any bruising after despite these tips and steps you can use an Arnica cream that will overtime reduce the bruises quicker than normal although you shouldn‚Äôt have so much as a red dot if you followed these steps! 

SORRY FOR THE LENGTH! But this stuff is all so important guys. You literally cannot even tell I shoot up because of these practices. Enjoy guys! And PLEASE me know if you have any questions. I am more than happy to help you guys out with being safe. Message me anytime.

Right now when someone submits a fent warning we lock the post and 'sticky' it to the top of the page. This system used to work really well back when the vast majority of heroin was.....HEROIN! and not the other way around, as we can only have 2 things 'stickied' at once and we might have 3-4 warnings in one day.

There will now just be one post stickied to the top of the sub titled 'Fentanyl warnings and information' or something similar to that. Inside this post there will be some information that is common sense to some, and valuable to others; like where to purchase fent test strips, signs of fentanyl dope, and other stuff like that. There will also be all of the fentanyl warnings that have been submitted to us listed from most recent and getting older.

**You guys will still submit the fentanyl warnings the same way that you have been** and we will continue to lock them, but they will be compiled, linked to, and organized inside this one post at the top of the sub. There will also be some additional features added like searchable flair and some other little things.

If anyone has any questions or comments feel free to leave them here and we will address them. Thanks folks!

For the first couple times, I got hooked up straight, I guess now that was to lure me in.  I never had to wait, I never got slacked and the shit was always fire.

Within a week the bags were getting slacker, the dope shittier and I'd have to wait upwards of three hours just to score a shit, slack point of bap.

To top it off, this motherfucker wouldn't answer the phone half the time.  I ended up having to buy overpriced blues in the interim and texted him telling him that he had lost a $300 play.

He texted me back with ""money doesn't make me move"".

I broke off all contact with him after that and continued to buy overpriced blues until I got a solid connection that is ALWAYS fat and I come to them, not the other way around.  No waiting or any bullshit.

Used to wake up and when I took my first pills, felt amazing, how most of you feel. Last year found out about kratom. Started a bad habit of taking more oxy some days and supplementing with kratom on low days.

Somehow, early this year, after 4 years of taking opiates, the euphoria went away. Like tolerant 24/7 even though I have that microwithdrawal in the morning before dosing

Often when I get my new batch of oxy I set aside hard work ""treat"" days where I take like up to 50-80mg and borrow from other days (where I just do kratom and 10mg). 2014-2017 those days I'd be drooling in love with myself. Now, when I tried that past couple months, just felt no different than 30mg, but tired, very itchy, bad eyesight. Extra side effects, no bliss. I get a legal perscription 30mg for nerve pain,in my late 20's now so maybe age plays a role.

I got into potentiators from here when I was running low and got desperate to make every bit count. Grapefruit juice, tonic water and DXM at the end of high dosing days, because it's supposed to reset tolerance. 

Maybe it was that, maybe it was sometimes taking kratom on the same day as normal oxy dose, in the afternoon, when in the past only took oxy between 9am-2pm, and toughing through the afternoon crash

Maybe if I figure out what I did wrong, I'll learn something valuable about tolerance and getting the most of your opiates, something I can teach others to avoid so they don't have this happen.",1523996398.0

The reason I'm asking, is because I had woken up this morning ready to go to the hospital, but my wife has the keys to the car with her at work and went be home until 5 or 6. 

So, I decided to get more aggressive with the heat and Epsom salt soaks every  hour or so compared to yesterday's every 6 hours, and it seems like its gotten better. The heat around the area is as close to being gone as you can get and the bump has decreased a little also. Another thing is it's not nearly as red and angry looking as it was. 

I never had any pain besides the issue of it being on my wrist and the discomfort of the swelling when I bent my wrist. I could push on it as hard as I wanted to and it would feel like every where else on my body. Oh yeah, still no fever, or red streaks have been noticed.

I just shot up a little while ago, after picking up my 2 month keytag.

I'm finding the same issues I had previously with NA still following me around. Basically, I don't like the culty-ness of it. I do like the comradery, the peer-to-peer support, I think that works amazingly well.


I can't even bring this up to my NA group or sponser because I get the canned response of ""well you're obviously not ready"" or ""you're not trying"" etc. I don't like how they will litterally harp and yell at a newbie if they use the wrong nonmenclature, etc.

edit: of course I'm not ready to get 100% clean, no addict is. See that's the problem, it's an all or nothing kind of thing. There's no middle ground I can shoot for and work my way up.



I don't like the ""obsessing about being clean"" aspect of it. I don't want drugs (or not using drugs) to be the main focus of my life.


I want to be able to use on the occasions I want to, and have the will power to say no when I know I'm encroaching physical addiction.

Basically, getting clean got me to a point where I could finally go to Central America and visit family.  I went, and was offered all the cocaine of  Central America for essentially peanuts.


So I bought the cocaine from some 12 year olds, and tooted my week away. I guess when I came back I wanted to do more of it, but cocaine is so expensive in the states and crap compared to the crap I was buying off the children.


Getting sober is a nice (lofty) goal, and I'd like to attain total sobreity, but not at the cost of my sanity.  IMO, living a life these NA hardcore people live, where it's constantly ""meetings this, sponser that, meeting, meeting...etc"", that's not what I want.


I guess what I'm saying is IDK what to do. should I continue on the NA path? or just give it up entirely? Or somewhere in between?

Non hateful opinions are welcome!

As are hateful ones, just remember you're being mean to someone who loves you.


and I *really* love you.


I don't feel like I failed, I feel like I hiccuped, and need some direction. Is there any way to balance this? Being a junky is no good, but being a NA-addict, is equally as bad imo.",1523980713.0

Also, what are your methods for getting your powder the finest?","Haven‚Äôt seen a post like this in a while. Everything is drug porn, candy porn, newb questions, etc. All are fine of course but wanted to change it up a bit. 

My ritual is that I have a box I keep everything in that has a nice smooth side. It‚Äôs from a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones and has perfect little compartments inside. I keep everything inside and take out what I need. 

My ROA, contrary to my user name, is to sniff everything. It‚Äôs something I started a long time ago and I think I‚Äôm more addicted to sniffing sometimes than the drug itself (not!). 

My DOC, which are oxy 30‚Äôs (A215 baby) come out, usually 2-3 depending on if first dose or not. I also take out my card, my straw, lighter and my clean (as it can be) dollar bill. 

Turn box over on my lap, so smooth side is on top and put dollar bill on top of pills. Put lighter sideways at first to make the initial crush. Once somewhat crushed I then turn lighter vertical and run everything over with the bottom of the lighter. I feel I get a better connection with the top of the box in order to crush everything finer. 

Once I get it as fine as I can I then scrape the dollar bill off as much as possible.  I know I shouldn‚Äôt because money is gross but to make sure nothing goes to waste I wipe the dollar and lick my fingers, then use wet fingers to clean rest of powder off dollar. 

Then use the card to chop away. 

This is where my second question comes in. I feel I can only get the powder so fine, and knowing that the finer the powder, whether it‚Äôs pill powder or H powder, I am curious what other methods people use to get the finest of powder. 

Next I line everything up and use the straw to take me to euphoria. I sniff as light as possible so that the powder coats my inner nostrils and does not go to my throat. A drip is inevitable but try to lessen as much as possible. (Btw, I love the way an oxy drip tastes)

I usually do this in my car which is parked in my apartments underground garage, so I feel safest there. I made a post the other day about how I go about doing it at work; which is a whole other ritual in itself.

He says he's brought over 10 people back from overdoses. He says he's the first to find them because he can feel life leaving a room. It's a gift he was born with. Chris believes a percentage of life juice saved from the dying is given to their savior. He first uncovered that truth when he was a senior in high school, he pulled his friend off the road before a truck sped by. His meth addiction is only secondary to his addiction to saving lives. Chris has absorbed enough life juice that he's beyond human, and by all intents and purposes, a god. Or so he says.

I'm sitting here listening to Chris explain a theory of himself and I don't believe it. The dude is fucking bananas. That being said, I'm hanging out with him because if I get a hot shot Christ is a good person to have around.

I have been a consistent user of oral synthetic opiate painkillers for several years and have developed a pretty massive tolerance. Obviously my standard dose has increased steadily  all while using the same medication and suddenly in the last three weeks or so something really weird has happened.  (and just to clarify yes I have confirmed the meds I have are the same, legit script I've been using, I'm not suddenly taking some fake pills with fent in them or something). 

But suddenly the dose I have been consistently taking, one which I very gradually built up to and have very established, consistent reaction to, was too heavy for me to the point of pretty significantly needing to reduce my dose and now literally only over the course of less than a couple weeks I've had to reduce my dose to what it was almost like a year and a half / two years ago, and it's still feels like it's maybe a bit much. 

Basically it's like I've experienced a sudden and inexplicable tolerance drop without having reduced my dose or frequency of dosing. Has anyone experienced this? Is it possible that there's some kind of latent medication built up in my system over the years that is multiplying my normal dose to be more potent?

I know to some people this must sound like the dream, a sudden tolerance loss without having to take a break but it's also kind of bizarre and frightening as I want to be careful and safe as well (as much as one can be). 

Any similar experiences or insight much appreciated.

I know about that, but I wanted ask how likely is it really, if one was to try some 10mg oxycodone IR, to get addicted.. I am just curious, because every time someone posts about wanting to try oxy, so many people advise against it in a way that reminds me of the horror stories of DARE campaign.. as I said, I understand opiates are a very slippery slope, I just wanted to ask if I'm missing something? 

Thousands of people are given oxy's every year for acute short term pain, yet they don't become addicts.. how much more addicting is this stuff really, compare to say 100mg of tramadol or 150mg of codeine (10mg oxy I mean, as they should not be drastically different in terms of strength..)?? if one is in a good mental state (no trauma, depression, anxiety), is this stuff as addictive as it appears form the comments deterring people from trying it even once?? 

I understand that every addiction started with that first dose and it's always better to deter people in case they would like it too much, instead of glorifying it. But I wonder if the way people respond to first time use questions is not too over the top?? Did your view on life drastically change after the very first dose?? Could you not stop thinking about the feeling for a very long time, until you went for more?? 

I'm just trying to understand, as I have had codeine and tramadol (as well as lot of other non-opiate drugs) and while they were pleasurable and I always felt like having some more for 1-2 days after, that feeling always subsided... Is oxy really that different from both weaker opiates (codeine, tramadol) as well as other dopaminergic drugs (coke, dexies, ritalin, aderall)??

I'm just asking cause this is such a lovely community of supportive people and it kinda struck me how strongly you are trying to deter others from trying from trying opiates in a way that almost seems too over the top (DARE type propaganda).. I'm not saying that you are overstating the risks, that's basically what I'm asking about.. Would you say the replies are 100% accurate (trying it once poses a major risk), or are they perhaps influenced by you guys seeing opiates taking so much away from you and your loved ones (and therefore a bit overstated, due to emotional involvement)??

**Via Cliff**
Buy dope on pay day through Cliff, inevitably loan $100-$150 so he can have dope. Thus effectively halving that which is available for my immediate consumption while spending double. Sure, I'll eventually get it back. One time surprisingly mostly in cash but often in pill form which cannot be spent on bills, Amazon or in most retail stores. For returning readers, I need not list the times in which Cliff engaged in shady shenanigans but for the unfamiliar search for posts with the flair ""Cliffpost, and ""Cliff Post!"". Entering the search query as *flair:Cliffpost* and *flair:Cliff Post* in the right side search bar for this subreddit seems to find all of the flared Cliffposts.

&nbsp;

**Via Tim**
Buy through my long time friend Tim. Not an option anymore. After the second time I bought through him, he went to a local hospital that had sort of ""three day detox"" program followed by being inducted into a Suboxone program. I don't know if he fell off the wagon since last week, I hope he is still clean. In his words, ""I spent over forty grand in the past two years."" He told his wife that he went into the program for ""opiates"" because he'd be on the street if his wife knew he was on heroin. I spoke to him briefly today and he said he'll contact me in a couple of days as he has a busy night and day of work ahead of him. I only bought dope through Tim on two occasions but both times everything went smoothly. He took whatever I offered as a middling fee without complaint and even offered subsequent fair trades without making me feel pressured to trade. For example, ""would you like to trade some of your bags for this many subs?"" He was also cool because he fronted the dope for me and based on my good word.

&nbsp;

**Via Derrick**

Derrick is Cliff's primary middle and Cliff often tells stories about him pulling shady shit. I suspect about 50% of the stories are made up shit, some of them are projections of Cliff on fictitious personification of Derrick. Other times Cliff makes up stories about Derrick in order to explain why the current order is a little short. When Cliff first started getting dope, Derrick would give him bags (10 bags to a bun) that were taped shut. Derrick claimed the dealer did this to ensure that any middle wouldn't tamper with them. When Cliff met Derrick's dealer, the guy said he did not put tape on the bags. It turned out that Derrick was taking shit out of the bags then taping them shut to make it appear like he couldn't have.



After Tim went on the wagon, I decided to bypass Cliff and buy directly from Derrick. First order was three buns, I gave Derrick half a bun for middling. I figured if I was generous he would be less likely to scheme. For that and the subsequent order Derrick did state he didn't care about the middling fee, that he was just doing me the favor. Of course I knew he wouldn't middle out of the kindness of his heart. Well, that first order, instead of ten bags to a bun as Cliff normally gets, it was four fatter bags. Since I was to receive 2.5 buns, the first bag represented one full bun. The remaining three were supposedly half a bun each. Derrick emptied one out to show me how it broke up into a number of lines. Then upon departure he said ""check it out, let me know what you think.. if any of the bags appear too small, let me know and I'll tell the dealer so he can include an extra bag on the next order."" Pretty sketchy to me. I have no idea without a scale or a reference that I'm accustomed to such as the buns that are divided into ten bags. In Derrick's words, it was quicker to have the dope ready in this form. The reason Cliff always gets ten bag buns is because ""he's mad stingy.""


&nbsp;

**In Conclusion**

Doing business and getting dope through Cliff is risky and generally sucks. As a fellow opi redditor once said, ""Cliff makes doing dope unfun."" Dealing with Tim was sunshine and roses but it ended too soon and I really can't complain for the sake of his family life and well being. Derrick is shady AF. Nice enough guy, hasn't had an opportunity to screw me over and put me through tribulations like Cliff has. Hell, he gets blamed for some of the shit Cliff has done when it was totally Cliff. Nonetheless, It's not viable to do business with Derrick in lieu of Cliff with the expectation that I'll get a fair shake. With my current options I will not get a fair shake. Thus, I'm better of sticking with subs and keeping my money.

Now about that writer's conundrum. I've been writing a Cliffpost. Wrote it three times, three different ways but it keeps coming out long. My last attempt has good grammar and makes sense to read for the most part but it's just very long and I don't want to post a wall of text even if I keep the paragraphs neat separate. I'm tempted to seek an editor but I don't want to waste someone elses time. 


On another note, someone said ""if only you put such effort elsewhere, you could succeed at anything."" So before I wrote the most recent Cliffpost draft for the third time I spent over two hours working on a book. I always considered writing a book, well two types of books.. One educational and another fictional. I'm glad I spent time on that, I don't actually know how books are written and how people make some books so damn thick but with self publishing being a thing, it's a worth a shot to engage in such an undertaking.

Mine are light blue in color.  M inside the box has very hard corners.  Cut them in half and they are solid light blue inside with maybe a spec or two of white.  They seem to have a bitter taste, but I'm not too good with taste.

They seem real to me.  I could care less about getting ripped off and more concerned about ending up in the ER.  Been a long time since I picked these up.

When I searched for fakes they appear to be darker in color with specs.  These seem to have NO SPECS?

Any advice is appreciated.  Pictures to compare even more appreciated!

Until he came under investigation from the local DA and now only will give Naproxen.  For three months I haven't been able to find a source, and a friend (who lives in a different state) says he goes to a pain management clinic that gives him more meds than he can take and I should look into it.

The problem is, I'll be a cash patient and just to visit these places it's $300, plus $50 for a pee test.  I don't mind paying that IF I most likely will be able to get a prescription.  I have some pretty brutal looking MRIs, but they're 3 years old.  What are the chances of getting a doctor who specializes in ""pain management"" to write a 10mg Norco prescription and not just tell me to swim or some other shit.

If you're wondering, no, I'm not in pain, I just enjoyed taking the occasional opiate every so often when watching a movie, or playing a video game.  They legitimately helped me with my life-long RLS, but mostly I just did it to enhance an already good time.  I've never taken more than 10mg in a day, and can easily pass a piss test.

These are tips I‚Äôve gathered from others:

-crushing the dope (I get rocks a lot) into the FINEST powder I can get it.

-separating the lines so that each one is very narrow and small. I heard this helps it absorb better in the mucous membrane. Fat lines are tempting but it gets me higher to break a fat line into many smaller lines.

-barely snorting (so that it doesn‚Äôt go down the throat and cause oral ingestion and a drip). I almost always make sure now when I sniff the dope that I‚Äôm not doing it hard enough to make a loud noise with my nose.

-straw farther up the nose.

-I was told to try and putting a few drops of water in each nostril beforehand. This seems to work really well.

Currently, she is taking half of a 10/300 before she goes to bed. If the pain becomes too bad, she will take a second half of the tablet. She is only taking half a tablet because taking a full tablet makes her feel to groggy and spaced out the next morning. (She is a college professor, she needs to be ""on"" by the time she gets to her first class.) 

She also mentioned that the vicodin doesn't seem to be touching the pain. I have urged her to ask the doctor about the possibility of a stronger painkiller such as percocet, but she is hesitant about doing so because she figures that it will make her even more groggy the next morning. 

I figured that this would be a good place to ask for advice. I have two questions: First, in your experience, is percocet likely to be a more effective painkiller than vicodin? Second, do you find that percocet makes you groggier in the morning? 

I realize that everyone experiences these drugs in different ways, but it would be nice to have some more data points.

I know I cause him pain, too. He knows I‚Äôm sick and in pain and depressed to the point where he doesn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be alive when he wakes up, and it causes him so much pain. He can‚Äôt sleep, he gets anxiety attacks and even his family‚Äôs noticed he‚Äôs been off kilter. I just drag everyone around me down. 

Is there any way to get out of a hole like this? Or am I really as fucked as I feel like I am. I just don‚Äôt know. Delete this if it‚Äôs too much of an off-topic rant, I don‚Äôt even know why I bothered typing this whole thing up. Guess I just needed to straighten out my thoughts. Some successful stories of people salvaging the shreds of their lives might help my outlook right now, if anyone has an uplifting tales...

Sorry again if this post isn‚Äôt really allowed. I just need someone to talk to ;-;",1523863975.0

Its been a little over a month-ish. (Dont know exactly when I stopped and i hate counting days).

This past week or so has been pretty brutal as far as cravings and anxiety go. It had been beating me down pretty hard and i was starting to begin the process of rationalizing a relapse. 

Tonight I said fuck it and ended up driving to a head shop to see if they sold kratom. I knew the chances of it being any good were slim and already held pessimistic views on its ability to be of any use in preventing a relapse despite all of the testimony to the contrary. But i was gonna give it a shot. So i bought a  bottle of bali capsules. And holy shit did they blow my mind. It was pretty subtle at first but after a while i began to feel like i had popped a couple vicodin. I only had to take 3gs too which was another surprise. I figured after a years long heavy habit such as mine, Id have to take at least 5gs to get any effect.

So definitely will be looking into vendors and buying more. The stuff i got from the head shop...i know its good but fuck its expensive. 15 bucks for 17 grams. Was mostly to find out if it would work and that it did. 

TLDR: skeptic decided to give kratom a shot before relapsing and was overwhelmingly satisfied. ",1523859402.0

I ended up grabbing just one bag off a cold cop spot while waiting for my main dude to be ready in a few hours (It was 6am). I shot the bag and awake hours later to somebody knocking on my window telling me I need to get the fuck out there and get rid of the shit on my lap (rigs, ect) I then went and met up with my regular guy and decided I'd wait until I got back to college to use again so that wouldn't happen.

Thanks to the advice and encouragement of you beautiful people, I got a new plug!

I woke up this morning sick as fuck. None of my people were answering my texts, and they / been since Friday.. so I decided today was the day. Im cutting out the middle man. 
LI drove across town to the plugs house. I was nervous.. what if he didn't remember me.. what if he thinks I'm the cops.. what if he thinks I'm trying to rob him and he shoots me through the door. Between being sick and the numerous ways this could go wrong, my anxiety was through the roof.

I knock... No answer... This is a terrible idea..

I knock again... Still no answer.. he's not going to go for this... Or maybe he didn't hear me.....

I ring the door bell.... His girl opens the door, and walks away.. ""lock that door behind you."" 

I'm in!

I go in and he's sitting on his bed.. scale and bag read and waiting. I explain to him that I was supposed to be meeting the middle, but he's bullshitting, so I figured I'd knock and just go straight to him. And I'll be damned.. ""Cool. Whatcha need?"" 

I left with a gram and his phone number.

An hour later the middle is calling and texting me, threating to kill me and calling me several unimaginative bad words. He says the plug won't fuck with  me anymore. But money talks.. we'll see what he says when I come by and buy my weekly ball. I can't imagine he'll turn that down.

So thank you friends! It worked! I'm plugged in!! X

Ill try making this short. A while ago I (like an idiot) agreed to do this swab test/DNA test to basically get results that would determine based upon my genes, what medications work and don't work.......SUPPOSEDLY) At the time I agreed, I was/still am really depressed all the time. So my thinking at the time was hopefully I can just get the right medication the first time around, as to rather than testing several and seeing which is best) - ***(Worst mistake was taking that swab test***)

FAST FORWARD TO NOW:
I recently seen a spine specialist whom seemed okay at first. (Im 28 and have 2 protruding disc and a narrow spinal canal, on top of that my SI and L5 **(S1 is the Sacrum and the L5 is the lowest vertebrae in our spine)** is sacralized **(fused bones together)**  - Congenital, was probable cause.

So this Dr, he ended up having me do an updated MRI (which sucks fucking assss I hate that machine) and we ended up also getting some new X-Rays on my lumbar. Before any meds, he made me do an epidural in my spine and yes I was asleep! LOL i was not ready for that. Few days later i told him it made it worse (truth), and so long story short he prescribed me x120 10mg Oxy-Hcl because I told him Ive had flare ups in the past and that was my typical prescription from the past- which was completely true.

Week or so later I get the results and went over it with the Psychiatrist - Turns out it says in some for or another for pain pills and medications I has been using for years now, including benzodiazepines, list them as ""Serum level may be decreased, an increased dose would be required) - **In other words theyre saying dont prescribe them this.** BUT anything in the ""stimulant section"" all had green marks, WHICH PISSED ME OFF, I WAS LIKE WOW WORLD I DONT DO STIMS AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DO TO ME?! (Sarcastically yelling lol)

I go in for my follow up appt with my spine doc and what not, and by then he got the test results of course. We do a few routine things and when we get to medications he says he wont prescribe me the same script, BUT he said he'd be willing to give me the same dose in HYDROCODONE (GENERIC OF COURSE). I tried to keep my cool because it made completely no sense. 

His excuse was ""well hydro usually last a bit longer in your system than oxy does"" and I say back something on the llines of ""whats the point of it lasting longer if it's a less efficient pain med and I would end up having to suffice by taking more since it would be less effective"" 

He wouldnt budge, I tried telling him in some form or another that he's incorrect by switching me to hydros but he didn't budge at all. I explicitly told him that I did NOT want OXY as my long term pain management, JUST ONLY for this new disc that is pushing against my nerve canal and is causing sciatica pain and overall discomfort.

I said fuck it, trying to not argue with him so I wouldn't portray addict-like behavior and got the script upstairs at their pharmacy. OBVIOUSLY AS EXPECTED IT WAS SHIT good for pain which caused me to use more way more. (AND I TOLD HIM THIS WOULD HAPPEN SINCE THEY'RE LESS EFFECTIVE......!) I got the Mallincrodt M367 10/325.

I ended up calling him a few weeks later and told him my rant and how they're not effective and its causing problems at work and so on. He said if they werent working than my other options ""per my results"" said I can do either surgery or fentenyl. I couldn't believe he was going to offer me fent, but not oxy... even worse suggesting me to do back surgery. Ive seen so many specialist over the years and they ALL said to NOT do surgery unless i absolutely needed to because of my young age. We argued and went back and fourth so much I had to hang up on him before I snapped on him.

* I'm scheduled for a second opinion Wednesday morning, and since I've scheduled it I'm getting nervous she'll tell me the same thing since the last doctor I seen was the head off the pain management section. I dont know how else to express to them that the oxycodone is so much better for my pain than hydrocodone is, without making it sound like you're a pill seeker. I even have like 30-20 Norcos left and its been way over a month now, that's how much they don't work.

**ANY ADVICE ON HOW TO APPROACH NEW DOC TO GET MY USUAL SCRIPT AGAIN??**

tl;dr - Getting second opinion for my back problems but the ""old"" doctor is the head of the pain mngnmt section. They want to give me hydros rather than oxy",1523838231.0

The other, a gorgeous, thicc black chick who digs my sense of humor, has started to unreliable, and only available at weird times. She has decent stuff for 60/g. But only if you catch her during her weird hours.

I make contact, place my order, and head to the spot. Dude is late, of course. But he is remorseful, legitimately. He threw in an extra dub and bought me taco bell cause he was late. If I wasn't sober and sick, I would've chalked it up to doap brain.

Just that you know you‚Äôre doing something ‚Äúnaughty‚Äù, and then getting away with it, and then the physical rush of the actual opiate upon injection. That psychological thrill I get when I have my dope & needle, got it all mixed up in a syringe that‚Äôs in a vein, followed by the (second, obviously) BEST part of the process, registering the needle by pulling back on the plunger. As soon as that lovely warm, red blood floods into the syringe I know all that‚Äôs left to connect the current psychological high to one of the most satisfactory physical feelings in the world is the simplest action ever, pushing the plunger down. 

I know a lot of people (especially when dopesick) say they wish they could and would if they could, take everything involving heroin or other opiates back. Sometimes when I‚Äôm sick too I might slightly agree, but I tend to brush that aside, sorta like how people say they ‚ÄúWill NEVER drink AGAIN!‚Äù while hungover as hell, but then inevitably do (usually).

If you have a tried & true method that actually works (ie positive its not placebo), plz share. I've been trying all week with no luck.

What I've tried so far:

-Plastic drugstore pill crusher (screw round piece into dish). Doesn't work ... beads too small and hard.

-Mortar & pestle. Beads just squash into gummy flat things with no powder (that's if they don't go bouncing off into the abyss).

-After crushing, soaking with vit C and some heat etc. Doesn't dissolve. And when I do shoot the mix (filtered to clear) I get no high.

End up having to dump the mix in my mouth. They work fine orally even after trying to soak out the drug, which suggests that none of the drug is dissolving in the water mix.

Now, I know better than to get too political or start fights on social media but I just had to pipe up and try keep this harmful mindset from spreading.

I wasn‚Äôt mean, just simply stated that we should fight for everyone to have access to the care they need and no one deserves to die due to a corrupt system.

I did heroin before fentynyl started coming to the area and when the new white dope came around it quickly became the only shit that could get me high.  Through my travels I've noticed that there is a difference in some users experiences with the drug. While in most people the effects are typical I've noticed an additional effect in a select few. I do not want to come off as insensitive in any way to anyone that experiences these effects that I am about to discuss, I am just curious if anyone else has noticed this definite pattern of behavior from other people or is it just me? 
  To begin I will start with the similarities of what I have seen these people doing. They usually start out with that swaying, dance fighting type moves, a lot of them clap, stomp around like they are a giant, some jump around in one spot. They sometimes do weird things with their fingers like crack them strangely or look like they are trowing up signs. They begin to talk to themselves and then the yelling starts. Every one of them uses multiple voices almost like they are acting out a conversation between multiple people and they use a different voice for each person. For some people you may only see one or two of these behaviors but the majority of them have the voices and/or have a conversation with themselves every time. The voices that are used are those of either a woman or a child, even when the user is male. I have noticed there seems to be a pattern that I am seeing but I do not want to share that at this point until I can get some sort of confirmation with others that may see these behaviors in people that they know.  Ive briefly looked to see if anyone has mentioned these affects anywhere on the internet and it seems as though none of this is being documented or reported.  While it does not affect me in these ways  i feel like its a real problem that needs to be looked into any experiences are appriciated",1523801924.0

And with that comes levels of loneliness never thought attainable. Well. If you're like me and you all are, which is why we get on so seamlessly; so nicely, you make these little-while friends any way you can. And sometimes these friends can't talk back. I'm sure you've all, at some point or another, befriended a stray cat or a homeless guy or a cloud or what the fuckever, just someone whose friendship you hadn't sought out but it fell in your lap, misery loves company and all that rot. And you embraced it because, well, every now and then we get low. So low. Too low. So it's a nice thing to have another to just be there beside you. Even if they're crawling up the wall. 

Well, I've been in one of these funks, in a bad way and even though we know it will pass, in the thick of it, it only feels like the first half of an eternity. Look, I'll admit it. I made friends with a bug. A ladybug, so at least I had some companionship with potential for a relationship but I wasn't so far gone that I didn't think for a second it wasn't a bug. But anyway, this little ladybug would crawl around my wall near my bed every day for the past two weeks. I mean, in a bugs life (our life, not the film) that's close to a Chinese empire's rule. That's forever. 

So, I'd be there, alone, sad, full of heartburn and dwindling booze, escaping warmth that came with the pills and an ever growing high tide of depression and I'd look over and she'd be there. This little tiny bug. A nothing. A hardly noticeable being that would walk and stop and walk and stop and crack open her back and lift her little plastic wings and flutter an inch or two and settle, still in eye-shot. It was company. I know it's insane, I'm not insane. It's insane but I swear I'm not insane. I think. But it was company. It was this thing that I could look at and truly tell myself, without any stretch of technicality or rationalization, that I wasn't alone. I wasn't. I had a pet. A pet I couldn't pet but a pet nonetheless. 

Well, we hung out off and on, playing the office on repeat back to back in a row for the 3rd time in my life, first time for her, I'm sure, I'm assuming but we watched. She really liked Dwight, I could tell. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan, I've grown to love jim and Pam but that's a whole other thing. Being my own therapist, without pay, mind you, I'm sure I'd just like a sweet girl. Obviously Michael is the reason to watch and the true best is David Brent but we can argue that in the comments. 

But we'd watch and Netflix would ask if we were still watching and we'd laugh and say, ""of course"" and hit play and continue on for another 3 half hours until prompted again. I wasn't alone. There was a little friend on the wall above my shoulder like just the angel without a counterpart. And just today, about an hour ago, I looked over and she was done. She quit watching, she quit crawling, she quit climbing the lampshade, no more random (to me) flutters and certainly wasn't venturing over to the pillow like that one time early on. She died. 

Now, she didn't overdose or anything, so I know I can't blame myself. In fact, I know she wished I'd lay off for a bit and maybe we could go out to the other side of the screen at some point. Or at least go down to the kitchen. But she's gone. And now I truly feel alone. I have literally no one near me that I can even look at that has their own agenda. And it sucks. 

Look, the whole point of this rambly, rambling nonsense is that when you feel more alone than you ever have, you aren't. If nothing else, I mean, *we* are here. But I get how that feels like it doesn't count. But don't feel like you're alone. We can all make ourselves get up and go outside and find a friend. Now, we also have to make sure that friend isn't going to hurt us but they are there. 

Okay. I've literally just realized that this is the most insane shit I've ever put to paper but whatever. Even if it's internet paper. Just, you're not alone and if you're unhappy reach out to someone, anyone. It will help. A first step doesn't have to be the destination. /r/Im14andthisdeep 

Okay. That's all. I had a friend. It was a little bug. And she just died. And I realize I need to shower and go try to be around people. We are social and it's really important to embrace that. 

I should truly try to stop. ",1523800984.0

I absolutely fell in love with it the first time I tried it. I actually was sober for about a month after my first stint in rehab. But other than that, I‚Äôve been getting high the rest of the time. 

I‚Äôve been to 3 rehabs since my first one and I literally scored some dope the same day I got out every single time. Funny thing is, I hate being dope sick. It‚Äôs horrible. I go through all that crap, start to feel so great sober but I just end up giving in. 

I‚Äôm back to doing it every day again. Tomorrow is always the day I‚Äôm gonna try to not do any. Then that leads to I‚Äôll just do one hit to get me through the day. To 2 isn‚Äôt bad to 3, 4, 5 and so on. 

I have a friend who works in the recovery business and he told me it‚Äôs scientifically proven that some people get to the point where they are addicted for life. No matter what they do, they will always go back to it. It‚Äôs like a point of no return and they can‚Äôt help it. 

The fact that I go to rehab, come out feeling great and can never even wait a day before I get high makes me worry a lot. 

Do I have any hope at all? I have cut back the past couple of weeks and I‚Äôve made my dope last much longer. I‚Äôve actually been proud of myself (which is really sad, I know). But what do y‚Äôall think?

They‚Äôre able to continue living at home due to our parents fear of them failing if they were removed as well as the assumption that it wouldn't effectively resolve the addiction issue. Steps are taken to discourage their using such as removing access to their car, requesting monthly rent, and no access to internet. This does nothing to stop the usage behind closed doors sadly and he becomes highly aggressive and manipulative when confronted about it. False promises are made and the cycle continues. 

Recently they were given temporary access to the vehicle in order to attend a funeral but ended up using the vehicle to engage in what has been assumed to be stealing packages. They installed a lock on their room door to hide the products without getting permission which sparked action from our father to have him return the vehicle and remove the lock, both demands were brushed off. We forced entry to the room and discovered the many items which he was clearly using to fuel his usage. All items were bagged and removed from the room. Upon the siblings return he lost control and vandalized our fathers room door with a hammer as a petty act of revenge, I intervened and talked him down but he continued to yell incoherently. 

All attempts at reasoning with him resulted in aggressive responses, eventually my brother pushed our father out of rage where they were put in a choke hold by me to stop any further physical aggression, I held on to his neck while everyone was yelling frantically but let go after my father saw that he‚Äôd had enough. My brother eventually took a seat and the whole family was screaming at him for lashing out at my father. He finally attempted to have a conversation but it was full of redirection to my father and my faults.

We were considering calling the police when he shoved our father but opted not to after cooling off, it seemed like he was finally going to get kicked out but after making various false promises he is now putting all his stuff back in his room which blows my fucking mind. My family has always had a tendency to enable my brother after so many failed attempts at rehab and self attempts at sobriety, I'm afraid that despite his recently crossed boundaries that he will be allowed to continue his ways.

It wasn't a funeral, no church or casket, it was held at an Audubon Society, with far more people than chairs. We were told to dress casually, and not nearly enough people took that seriously. I'm a bit of a hip, preppy sort anyway so I wore a Yankee hat with some skinny pants and a shirt I stole from my brother.

He liked the Yankees a lot. We're from a family almost entirely concentrated in Massachusetts, so he was one of few.

A friend of his spoke, talking about the courage of banality, of waking up every morning and getting shit done, of doing what you need to or feel obligated to, and how much that can wear you down over time. How much sobriety seems pointless and numbing and is just getting up to do the same old shit every day, the kind of capitalist ethics of this bravery in facing what one has committed to and what commitment takes out of you in late capitalist life, talking about the urge to get high and the way that it is, at the very least, something. It feels like something. It *is* something.

I remember his step-father referencing it before the service, and a nod to it in his mother's thoughts: the idea that he was the healthiest addict anyone had met, a nod to the way that he was an avid bike rider for a great portion of his life, even when using. He loved accomplishing and completing not in a sense of mere economic structures but in seeing things through, in creating better means for others to find a proper orientation and ideation of themselves, how he loved getting dirt under his fingernails and loved traveling across the country.

When they invited anyone who felt so compelled to speak, I found myself up there. I've been good at schmoozing, speaking in public and private, and most of all the art of extemporaneous speaking for quite some time. I don't remember that much of my speech apart from how much everyone seemed to like it, and I wish that were from some bars rather than a bout of depression-induced dissociation. 

We know it was heroin, but I still don't know how it happened, and considering some of the ways my dad and his talked about opiate use and how it should be opposed or controlled or dealt with in the panopticon gaze of contemporary law, I think I want to let it be a bit of a mystery. I can imagine it well enough anyway: he relapses enough to feel like he has a tolerance again, draws up a shot or two, is barely feeling the first when the second throws him a hot spot. Or maybe his relapse was just with some real good shit and he should've been sniffing it first. Whatever it was, it's a bit late for harm reduction. 

I feel hurt, empty, but what's worse is that I feel like using. I haven't had heroin in over a year, and I have been sober since I got into some shit back in January, since living at home is a drag. Before that I was showing that banal courage, that ability to drag myself out of bed every day for another shot at sobriety, for a whole year. When I hear all of these people talking about not trying it, about how it ruins people like him, I can't help but feel like I know it too well to ever forget. 

Can't unring that bell. 

I wish my bell were ringing, I wish I had a bundle or a g of some raw, I wish I had some white girl and some bars to go with it, I feel pathetic for being sad I never got to chase the dragon with him.

I recently got my hands on 5 8mg Dialudid. I have never tried these before. 

75-90mg oxy (oral) usually gets me where I want to be. I occasionally snort my roxies but mostly oral. 

My question is what is the best ROA for these hydros? I‚Äôm hearing oral is a waste of time.

doctors do normally inject a ful syringe of morphine? if this is not normal,in what situations do doctors do this?



i just started thinking because its the rush that my bf an addict,a lot of people have been using opiates in hospitals,so if they give them a full needle of morphine,after feeling the rush,wouldnt they understand why someone could get addicted to that?

I have this one vein that always hurts and stings like hell when I'm pushing in. It feels like I'm completely missing,  but if I try to register I'm still good. Also, I NEVER have any of the signs you see after a miss. It's on my wrist/hand, so you could hide the typical lump you get after a miss. Also, it hits me as quick as a normal hit would. 

I know that you're probably thinking that I hit an artery, but its definitely not an artery. 

1st. It's a very very dark red color. Not the bright red from an artery. 

2nd. It doesn't hurt at all to puncture the vein like a artery does. It's only when I'm pushing the plunger and the quicker I push the more it hurts.

3rd. When I register, the flow is the typical flow. I've always heard that an artery actually will push the plunger back from all the pressure. 

4th. The blood isn't frothy like artery blood is.

5th I can hit this vein in other area with no pain.


My only guess is that the vein is right next to a nerve and when I push in the plunger the vein can't move the dope quick enough and causes the vein to bulge and put pressure on the nerve. The pain feels a lot like nerve pain in that it burns very bad and I feel it up my arm.",1523748316.0

And I really couldn't/didn't wanna miss the shot trying to do it there myself. The spot is right near the crook of my arm. But more to the left. Id say halfway between there and my elbow. 

Anyways, he ended up hitting me successfully. Easy as pie! And as he was pulling the rig out.. A fucking stream of blood like SHOT straight directly out of the hole. It actually looked just like a chick squirting from her pussy. Except it was only blood that came out. But it shot out.. like wicked far out and straight up in the air. It actually looked kinda cool when it happened lollll Like it reminded me of some alternative or abstract art!üòé Has this happened to any of you? Or have you seen this happen to someone else?



Also- totally random and off topic. BUT... As I was writing this post, my bf was coming out of Walmart and walking back to my car.

I've been using opiates for 5 or so years, heroin for 2, but only started IV-ing a little over a month ago. My heroin use increased a lot since codeine became prescription only on 1 Feb. Before that I was mostly a codeine addict, and would get H when I could afford it. I was also unemployed up until 5 weeks ago so now I can afford all the H I want (except I'm currently in withdrawal because I lost my bitcoin cash deposit to a certain DNM and still haven't got my coins back).

There was no fent or anything in this dope, I just had too much. I got careless. I had too many times where I had too small a dose and had to make another shot, and I only have one vein I can usually get to, and only get 5 needles at once. I should have invested in good quality mg scales or at least used the crappy one I have. Other than that I was careful and sterile with everything.

The amount I dissolved was in one solid rock so it looked like much less than it was and I actually thought it wouldn't be enough.

I hide my usage from my boyfriend and housemates. I like to shoot up in the shower/bath (it's a showerhead over a bathtub). It's a nice place to do it, it's private, and I tend to bleed so being able to rinse it away right away helps. 

I didn't fill up the tub this time, I just turned the shower on so I could feel the warm water running down my back. I was excited that I got a vein so easily and injected it all at once. Usually I would titrate the dose, which means I don't get the same rush I could, but I'm less likely to die. This time I felt it, the rush. But I knew, as soon as I felt it, that I'd had too much. I had that feeling of losing control. I told myself ""it's okay, I'm still conscious, everything is fine"". I managed to take the needle out of my arm but didn't manage to put the needle cap back on. The next thing I remember was hearing my boyfriend calling my name from outside. I didn't know what was going on. I know that for a second I felt annoyed at being woken from such a peaceful slumber, even though I had no idea why I was lying asleep in the bathtub. 

Once I realised where I was and what was happening, I got up as quickly as possible and turned off the shower. I responded to his calls asking what was wrong. He was saying there was water leaking out into the hall. I was so confused because the bath was empty and the bathroom floor was completely dry. But my main concern was getting rid of all the evidence of my shooting up. I found the needle, couldn't find the needle cap so put it in a sharps container, and I quickly shoved everything else into a bag. 

I then got out of the bath and tried to find out what was going on. I was so fucked up, but luckily no one could tell. My housemate came into the bathroom and saw that the bath faucet had completely caved in, leaving a hole in the wall. I must have been lying there unconscious for 1 or 2 hours, after falling backwards and causing the hole in the wall, with the water running, which explains how it leaked into the hall.

At first I didn't even understand that I'd overdosed because of course I couldn't remember being unconscious. And I didn't understand how the faucet had broken because I didn't remember falling (I must have fallen after I became unconscious - which would make sense), and I was still so fucked up I couldn't feel the pain in my back. I remember staring at the broken faucet trying to understand, and I could barely even see because heroin affects my vision so much. 

I was in no state to do anything at that point. I stayed in the bathroom and got dressed but I got back into the bath. I wanted to make sure there was no more evidence. Plus the bath seemed like the safest place to be since I was barely functioning. I still hadn't found the orange needle cap, that last piece of evidence. Then I was pretty sure I saw it go down the drain and for some reason thought it was possible and necessary to get it out of there. I thought the plumber would find it and say ""here's what caused the issue"". At that point I still didn't understand what had happened. And my understanding of basic plumbing was missing because I was looking for the needle cap in the hole in the wall, amongst the broken tiles, after failing to get it out of the drain (it was properly down the drain). There was no way the plumber would come to fix a faucet and replace some tiles and find something that had fallen down the drain, but it took me a while to figure that out.

Eventually I decided sitting in the bath any longer would just seem even more suspicious, so I got out and helped soak up the water in the hall. I said I would get a plumber to fix the faucet. For some reason no one questioned how it broke.

I only pieced it all together later when I saw the bruises (and felt the pain) on my back, remembered the initial rush and feeling like I was losing control, and had vague memories of a peaceful dreamlike state while lying in the bath.",1523713909.0

During that time I learned a few, legal, tricks and loopholes. For those of you who have state funded insurance it‚Äôs a little harder to do but still possible. Say you have a prescription that has like a $500 copay because America is fucked. Go on that drugs website and search ‚Äòsavings card‚Äô. You‚Äôll most likely have to enter an email or a phone number. In doing so you‚Äôll receive some numbers that can be used in place of your state insurance card. They look like this 

ID Number - 123456789 (sometimes up to 3 letters in the beginning)
BIN Number - 123456
Rx Group - ABCDEF
PCN Number - 1234

Now keep in mind, if you have state insurance it will not work in conjunction with that insurance. However, with that being said, nine times out of ten the ‚Äòsavings card‚Äô is cheaper than what the state is willing to pay. Sometimes pharmacies will be dicks and if they already have your state insurance on file, they won‚Äôt even apply the card for you by itself. Go to a different place and use just the savings card. 

If you have private insurance, you‚Äôre in luck. You will be able to use both your insurance as well as the ‚Äòsavings card‚Äô to drop your copay even lower. 

I have had copays drop hundreds of dollars by doing this for customers. One time that sticks out is a women coming in just looking completely fucking defeated. Her husband was not taking his psych meds because they could no longer afford the full month, so they‚Äôd get as many as the insurance allowed a month. Which was NOT enough. I was able to get her a full months supply with an extremely low copay. Use this advice for your scripts people. I can‚Äôt guarantee that it‚Äôll work on opiates, but it does on most (not all) meds, especially name brands. Be good to each other and stay safe.

Whats your thoughts?,"First off I never did this I only remember reading about it a while back so the details are a little fuzzy...

Basically, if I remember correctly it went a little something like this; someone in the US on government-sponsored healthcare goes to a lenient doctor (not pill mill) and is prescribed a prescription for opiates they don't *need* or they are over-prescribed. Then for much much less than street costs or online pharmacy costs which can now exceed $1 a mg... but either part of or the entire months supply from said person. The story I recall, someone purchased the entire prescription, a supply of **120** 30mg Roxycodone, for somewhere between $250-$300.

Like I said, I have never done this and it is unlikely I would ever even have the opportunity to - but shit if I could I would do it in a heart beat. Thats less than 1/10th the street price. This has to be by far the cheapest way to get real pharmacy oxy without getting your name put into the state database avoiding some of the unfortunate consequences that come along with that.
