Anything after isn't because abuse makes it worse but omg when you really don't abuse it thr first shot  is from heaven.

It's literally what a rush from a drug should feel like.

When you do just 1 shot and do your next one 48 hours later you suffer no withdrawals at all.

I've been through full blown addiction and I recently got sober.

I pray and want luck to be able to just do it once in the morning at a relatively low dose such as 8-12 mg and then be done. I've only ever suffered wkth addiction and withdrawal doing the drug multiple times a day every day.

When I go overseas I'm taking like 20-30 pills and doing a shot once a week and it'll be amazing.

Falling hard?,"So I've been using for about 2 1/2 years now, but have always stuck to one super bitch of a dgirl up until about November of last year. Then I was amazed to find a reliable, respectful guy with better prices AND higher quality ECP. He is extremely good looking and has a ripped bod to boot. (JACKPOT YAY ME)

Anyway, the usually all-but-certain question to be asked of any decent looking female junkie by a male dealer was asked of me. He wanted to know if I would ""spend some time'' with him for free product. Although this goes against every moral on that fucked up compass most of us have (or had, some time long ago), it didn't take long before I gave in. And to be fair, I would have wanted dat ass anyway ;)

I half expected the chivalry/respect to all but cease after that, but quite the opposite happened.. he is genuinely interested in my life and makes comments about various things showing that he actually cares about my future. For example, I just scored this amazing job I've wanted for years (graduated college 2 years ago), and he had a concerned talk with me about how I need to ""quit the shit"" ""because this is your future, [enter my name]"". Then last time we met up, he took me to his new office space that he and a friend are turning into a barber shop in the hip yet ghetto downtown area. He showed me the layout and when I tried to hand him the money for the dope, he put it back in my hand but threw me a g. I was shocked.

Later that night he even texted me the drawn out floor plans for the space he has rented for the business. I felt flattered that he wanted to show me something so important to him. So I guess my honest question is, is there any possibility this dboy is into me for more than sex or is he just a really really above average nice guy?? Bc truth be told, I'm starting to get those motherfuckin butterflies now whenever I see his name pop up on my phone and I know that is NOT normal!

Edit: I also would like to clarify I am highly doubtful I'm his only customer he's putting the moves on. I just feel like I'm seeing a different side to him than most would expect to see in this situation, like he's revealing more of himself and his personal life to me and vice versa. And I really do trust him on that level. I'm not expecting a marriage proposal or even a date proposal lol. It's just nice to have someone like him in my life, I guess.

I'm still awake and only have .3 left... Read about my ridiculous day... I'm broken man.,"I usually buy 2 points a day. But this day I took an Adderall as well. And I usually don't do dope on Adderall, don't feel the urge. Before taking the Adderall I did 6 8mg dillies and did not get a single rush like I expected... My tolerance is MUCH higher now apparently because 8mg of dilly use to give me a godly rush man. Even 2mg I'd feel.. They were real Hydromorphone. It's the tolerance for sure. 

BUT....

This fuxking time I have been shooting like a point and a half to 2 points every 2 hours... I thought it'd last me at least 2 nights ya know... But once I get my hands on it I have a hard time not doing it till its gone.. Because my guess is this dope is fent not heroin what so ever. And my 1cc 100 unit syringe can't hold more than 2 points I think. Actually barely holds 2.. It's sooo dark when it's in the syringe I can't even tell when I register unless I got my flashlight shining on the syringe as I'm injecting. 

This was my last cop tho. I'm starting my formula to quit tomorrow. I hope it works, wish me the best.. 

I also got Super Mario Odyssey today but the Adderall kept me on runescape alllllllllll day and guess what.. I lost 15 MIL gambling in the game too... Was so upsetting. As soon as that happened I dosed heavy again. IDK when I'm gonna go to bed... I'm barely tired it's been a while since I've taken Adderall.

My question is, if I have some sort of back pain all day around would I be better off maybe trying an ER instead of IR? I thought they quit making OxyContin but someone here mentioned they still make it but I think only extended release. I have a few disc herniations, sciatica that runs down my leg and my s1 joint is to the point my hip doesn’t stay fully in place having to always go to the Chiropractor to stay in alignment. 

These hydros aren’t cutting it especially after coming off of bupe. They are barely keeping me out of withdrawal. Still have some rls pretty bad an I even got myself down to 2mg of bupe a day sometimes less. Is there any other type of ER med you guys recommend over an IR for pain? The only thing I don’t like about IR is sure you get a half decent buzz but a few hours later and my pain is back which ruins any sort of positive effects the opiate gave you. Do you think there’s any chance I could eventually work my way to an ER and IR for breakthrough pain? I hate to even mention the names of any painkiller to not see like a drug seeker. However, this was even my doctors opinion to quit the bupe without me bringing it up and he’s the most liberal type of doctor I’ve had, if you know what I mean. Should I just be straight up and be like how about roxicodone or is that pushing it? I just hate to keep paying my doctor for something that doesn’t work. It has been just over a year since I’ve had a full agonist opiate other than a couple 5mg hydro the last few days to try and make my withdrawal bareable. He says I can call in if they don’t work but I hate to see like a drug seeker and I thought maybe he’s testing me???

I want to be at the point I only need maybe 30-40 mg of oxycodone when in pain and get relief. Now that I’m older and been down the road of experimenting with H I really don’t find interest in chasing a high because Ik that will just lead me to running out of scripts early. I do not want to lose this doctor. Also is Dilaudid still given out or is it pretty rare? I remember a few years ago how well only 1-2 pills of those worked for pain (snorted btw) because oral for those is a no go. Do you think a doctor from Syria would possibly write for those if I brought it up or is oxycodone just as good for pain? I just want to find my perfect med and stick with it. I think it may hurt that I’m in my 20a btw. The doctor knows my pain is legit my father had to drive me to the doctors the other day because I pulled my back out again only from sweeping the garage floor and could barely get around. He could tell i was in some pain. Any recommendations for pain like this would be highly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",1521764770.0

The supply of Oxy in my area has diminished quite a bit. About a month ago I found a connect who has Morphine 30s and 60s for a very solid price. 

Anyway, I’ve been plugging 120mg between morning and mid-afternoon and then a few additional smaller Mg plugs throughout the day, or another bigger Mg plug in the evening. Although the high doesn’t provide as much of a “euphoric rush” or uplifting feeling, I’ve grown to really enjoy. It’s very mellow and relaxing, more subtle but just as enjoyable for me. 

Not to mention lasts WAY longer, and the sickness comes way later for me. I can plug 120mg Morph at 10pm the night before and be good all day the next day until evening. Where as Oxy, if I sniffed 60mg at 10pm, I’d be feeling kinda shitty by noon the next day. Call me crazy, but for the price, duration of the high, and it keeping me well so much longer, I’m starting to enjoy Morphine almost as much, if not more than Oxycodone.

I love it. The thought that I have to be very sneaky and watch my back. It's always so great. Back when I used to do pills before I graduated to just snorting heroin at my desk, I would get my pills out, usually 2 or 3 oxys, sometimes vics if that's all I could find, to take orally and sometimes I'd take them out and I'd hear someone coming so I would push the pills behind the monitor where no one could see.

On multiple occasions, I forgot that I had placed the pills behind the computer, already being high, I just forgot I guess a couple times and would reach into my purse for more. Now, this was actually a blessing believe it or not... sounds more like a nightmare, I know.

But apparently the night clean up crew here are not junkies. Because on multiple Mondays (cleaning crew only comes Friday evenings) I would come into work in the morning and see, every so neatly placed on my drink coaster, whatever pills I left behind the monitor. I also would sometimes during the week, just happen to look behind the monitor, seeing the pills and being ecstatic because I forgot about them. 

Now; leaving those pills out taught me 2 things. 

1) BE MORE CAREFUL AND STOP PUTTING PILLS BEHIND YOUR MONITOR

and 2) no one here gives a shit what I actually do.... because one day someone was using my desk on a Monday morning after the cleaning crew had put my pills on my coaster... I came in and someone was at my desk. Surely she did not miss these two bright yellow vicodin. She welcomed me back from the weekend, and went back to her own seat without seeming strange or like she knew anything, but surely she had to have seen them, the coaster is about 5 inches from my computer mouse so when she looked to sit at my desk she has to have seen them right away and just, no one cares which is fine with me.

In the height of my addiction I was banging💉 10 roxy 30 mg's a day. Good times!! I'm a army combat veteran and opiates really helped my pain and helped me manage PTSD. Eventually I had to quit because I thought I had a problem. Looking back my problem was I couldn't afford my habit, It was too expensive!😬 I also felt a lot of guilt because of the stigma from society about opiates. I've been clean for three years. I chip maybe three times a year. And yes I consider that being clean. Idgaf if judgmental people disagree. Anyways, I've been getting a strong itch to use and I finally gave in today (hence this long post, lol). Before I called my old dboy, I went on a mission to buy pins. It took about four hours to find a pharmacy that would sell me pins. So frustrating!!  My heart really goes out to people who are are using frequently and don't have access to clean needles. The way we treat ""the least of thee"" is atrocious. Boo Florida!! No needle exchange and no sell pharmacy needle policy is so backwards. I guess the state thinks addicts and users shouldn't have the right to minimize their harm. What a public health nightmare!! Rant over. 😊 Does anyone know of needle exchange non profits in Florida? I would like to donate... Money that is. Hehe",1521739256.0

I know that's not a huge habit, but it's still a habit. I used to cop smaller amounts (3 pills) and let myself run out between scores, then the break between each score got smaller and smaller, then I started copping larger amounts (5 pills, then 10). Most recently, I blasted through about 20 pills in about 14 days. I decided that was more than I wanted to be doing, and decided to let myself detox and take some time before using again. I took 1mg subs the first day, 1/2 mg subs the next, and then only kratom and small doses of loperamide for four days. I'm on my seventh day of no oxy, and I have zero physical withdrawal symptoms, but it's like suddenly all this shit is going wrong in my life. My relationship is shitty, my friendships are deteriorating, and my lease is almost up. I honestly don't know if it's actually gotten worse, or if I was just ignoring how bad it was before because I could get high instead. None of them know I use. What's worse is a couple days ago I committed to my biggest score yet (25 pills) that'll be in tonight, because I was told that was my only option until early next week and I couldn't wait that long. Now I'm questioning the role oxy is playing in my problems, and I'm not sure if I need to commit to staying clean to work through the issues in my life, or if I can work through them while I use. I'm not even sure that I can commit to not using if I have that score at home. Plenty of times I've told myself ""not today"" but it never works; if I have pills, it's almost like I can't not take them. What should I do? How much of my problems are independent, and how much of them are because of drugs? I could really use some advice from people with more experience than me. ",1521736005.0

What amount of Oxy in Mg would you all consider to be a small/medium/large/insane tolerance?

Right now, I can quite easily consume 100Mg~ daily without giving it much thought at all. Am I wasting my Oxy? 

For instance, last month I didn’t take any Oxy. This month, the last two weeks, I have consumed 56 40mg tabs and now onto my second pack. Is this wasteful? 

I’m just trying to gauge if I should slow things down a lil bit to get the most out of my product. I don’t have any issues with stock potentially running out. Nor will I loose my house/car/set of bagpipes to outstanding depts.

Just want to respect Oxy as I am aware it is a very precious and sought after commodity.

FYI, I am familiar with Oxy and pharmaceutical opiates/oids In general. Have indulged in varying degrees for many years so am aware of the potential pitfalls/benefits and am comfortable with my own limits/aware of my own body.

I recently was walking around the new town that I moved to and noticed that we have a shittier ghetto area. Open air markets aren't common at all here, but these were obvious drug blocks. I saw crackheads walking around, few houses that just had dudes standing outside looking like they were posted up, and even saw a guy on a bicycle pull up to a dudes car do some kind of exchange and ride off.. so i'm assuming I found the blocks lol I just don't know how to go about cold copping there. I'm fairly street smart and I know when something fishy is up, I know to never let the money walk, but do I just walk past and make a comment about dog food or boy and see if anyone picks up on it?

86r06j,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/86r06j/xtampza_experience_with_breaking_time_release/,3,https://redd.it/86r06j,CYPROXY,Xtampza - Experience with breaking time release.,"So I acquired several 18mg Xtampza capsules for very cheap (about $10 each). My first experience with them, I had tried to crush the little spheres inside and it simply didn't work. They don't crush insofar as they *smush*and just turn into a flat sheet of plastic/matrix shit.

When I ended up snorting it, it plastisized the inside of my nose and didn't drip **at all** and hours after I snorted it I was snorking plastic shit out of my nose.

I'll add that I didn't get much of a buzz for the amount I snorted.

Fast-forward to now. I took 2, 18 mg capsules and emptied the contents onto a small aluminum billet (2x3.5 inches) as it has a small 3mm lip so stuff doesn't spill out. Turns out this was a good idea.

I put the powder on the billet and put it in a toaster oven @ 350 degrees. Within a few minutes it didn't turn brown or anything, rather it melted exactly like wax would. It turns utterly clear like wax.

I didn't let it boil, instead I removed the billet with tongs and set it in the freezer on a slab of ice/frost. It immediately solidified **exactly** like wax would going from utterly clear to opaque in seconds. Once it was solidified it had features of very hard wax insofar as you could scrape it with your fingernail and remove bits easily with your nail but I was at a loss as to how this current form would be used intra-nasally. 

I reheated the waxy stuff and added a pinch of baking soda and mixed it up slightly and re-heated it once again.

About a minute later it had re-liquified but was more opaque when liquified vs being crystal clear before.

Again I set it in the freezer and it solidified but was whiter from the  baking soda this time.

Now when you scrape it with a knife, it actually scrapes up [powder.](https://imgur.com/a/czyBb)
I insufflated about half of the material and waited. The baking soda burned a little bit but on a positive note my nose ran like hell just like when I oven-method oxycontin OP's and snort them.

25 mins later I'm happily buzzed so I feel that although I wouldn't say I *defeated* the time release matrix (I didn't destroy it per se) I did, however, change it's form to something that my nose can use. I'm not snorking back chunks of anything whatsoever. Just liquid at this point which is a super plus in the pro column.

My nose *does* feel congested though although it might just be from the irritation from the baking soda. I'll update this post it I end up snorking back a massive blob of plastic or something.

So, yeah. Pretty nifty. :)

**UPDATE** - It *definitely* works better than trying to snort the Xtampza spheres in stock form. I'm absolutely as high as I expected to be on 20mg of oxy.

*Interesting note for chem nerds* - XTampza is Oxycodone proper. Not Oxycodone HCL. It's my understanding that this reason ties into why all Xtampza capsules are slightly less milligrams than their Oxycodone HCL counterparts. Meaning the 20mg equivalent is 18mg, the 10mg oxy equivalent is 9mg and the 40mg equivalent is 36mg.

I'm purely speculating but is it safe to assume that mixing with stomach acid or some other first pass metabolism action is what converts to the HCL version? Food for thought.

I've been taking 5-10 mg Oxy, no more, every day/ every other day for almost 9 years now. I've taken a few 3 week breaks, and I take week long breaks every now and then, but otherwise pretty consistently. 
This little amount of oxy is enough to make my day good. On the bad days it helps makes things bearable, and on the good days it makes life feel content and happy. I'm not getting super high secretly and it’s not impacting my work or relationships, but I am self-medicating (with a very low dose)
I don't feel like I'm negatively addicted, in the sense that it doesn't affect my life in really any other way than give me a small boost of happiness that improves my mood, motivation and overall happiness. Almost like a longer lasting cup of coffee. 
I'm writing this here because I haven't talked to anyone in my life about this. I'd like to get some outside perspective. 
I know some people would label this as 'high-functioning addict' but I truly don't think I fit into this category. I don't ever take more than prescribed to me, struggle to control my dosage, or abuse drugs otherwise. 
The little amount I use everyday is mentally therapeutic, and at such a low dose, is it really abuse?
I feel as though I use it medicinally. It mentally supports me and gives me a little push, to enable me to find the happiness in myself on the days where I can't.

Cliff probably thinks I'm committing some kind of betrayal by not wanting to help him buy dope. He may only suspect that I've taken my business elsewhere but it is evident to him that his days of getting my money are rapidly coming to an end. Just as last week, he owed me half a bun and was willing to credit me another full bun. I declined because I did not want to owe him anything a week later. Even if I were to just owe him a single bun, I know he wouldn't let me buy one bun for him and call it a day. Hell, I didn't owe him anything and he still came knocking.


&nbsp;

So last week as far as Cliff was concerned, that was my last hurrah. I even used that phrase in a sentence and it appeared to have landed on his deaf ears since he didn't acknowledge the statement. Nonetheless, I've said it a dozen different ways and he knew damn well that I wasn't buying dope with him this week. I had my reasons, some relating to certifications and career. Of course I have other rasons, but by screwing me over Cliff fucked with my money for certifications as well my own happiness.


&nbsp;


As stated in the [first part of this particular tale](https://redd.it/86aoul) in the greater Cliff saga, it all started on snowy morning. As evidenced by my front door surveillance camera, he loitered at my door for nearly two hours. For the first hour I was simply asleep. Then upon hearing a text message chime, I checked my phone and it was Cliff asking me to come to my door. I tried to pretend that I was not home, that I was at work.


I knew his emergency was simply that he wanted ask me to do something before I left for work. I thought he wanted me to physically do something like pick up his mom's script but it wasn't script day. Before I bothered to come to my door I texted ""ovbiously you want me to do somethig that I don't want to do before work."" Cliff denied and tried assuring me that this was not the case. 


&nbsp;

He kept texting and asking me to open my door. That it was cold outside. I still can't believe he used that statement, I didn't tell him to come to my house in the snow before I woke up. Eventually I let him in after my first cup off coffee.


I was clear that I did not appreciate his presence but I heard him out. He asked if I was buying dope this week. I told him and confirmed that nothing has changed since last week. That I was not planning on buying dope this week. He then tried convincing me saying ""just one last hurrah, please."" As I ate my breakfast I told him that his presence was giving me indigestion, that I didn't want to do it but after his annoying persistence I told him I would seriously consider it. Just to go and leave. That I would drop my debit card off on my way to work.

&nbsp;

Cliff confirmed that he placed hte order and I started having second thoughts. I didn't like how bugged me in the morning before work to get me to do something I didn't want to do. I told him that he should cancel the order, that he would cancel the order if he respected my wishes.


Cliff whinedd in text, ""Dude, don't do this to me please"", ""I have them already coming with order for 1pm.""

I was willing to just let this go, but had I known what plan Cliff had in store for me this would've gone differently. For some stupid reason I trsued that this would go just as it has in the past. As long as I Was clear in the begining of what I expected and wanted, nothing would go drastically wrong.

I was dead wrong. It is my own damn fault for allowing myself to be put into a position to be taken advantage of. This proved to be on the of the most blatant violations of my trust.


&nbsp;

The other caveat, since I had to leave for work (and secretly to see Tim for dope before work), I had to hand Cliff my debit card to take out an agreed upon amount. $200, he'd get 3 buns, 2 for him and 1 for me. Then come Tuesday he would pay me back. He assured me that he'll give me money on Tuesday but I know he wont have money because he has to sell the pills he's getting.


So in all liklihood he's not paying me back in cash but in pills. There's also a possibility that he won't pay me back in full. Which is good in away because I'll just tell Cliff that I'm not fixing the power cord for the MacBook I sold him. It would've kept working if he didn't do such a shitty job of taking care of his shit.


BTW I just spoke to him and he said that he's selling the pills right after he gets the script. So sure enough, he won't have the money right away because it'll take a while. I'm formulating some ideas.

&nbsp;

Speaking of the MacBook, he rarely pays his debts in full. I basically sold him an old MacBook for $200 or three buns of dope. After he gave me the first two buns of dope, I thought I'd never get the third one. Then his power cord malfunctioned because I provided a faulty one in case he didn't pay me back in full. Then suddenly Cliff cared about paying me third bun if I managed to fix the broken power cord.


After a few weeks he broke wore the repaired power cord, destroyed my special structural modifications through his carelessness. In recent weeks he wants it fixed and he keeps bragging that he paid the cost in full.


The one time Cliff paid his debt for something, he milks the bragging rights. It's quite hilarious, annoying and pathetic. 


&nbsp;

Bottom line. Cliff waited outside my door for nearly two hours in the snow. When I finally let him in he wouldn't leave until I vouched some kind of commitment. I only did it because he promised me that I'd get my money back on Tuesday even tohugh he probably was just saying whatever I wanted to hear. There was some truth to it but I know if I count on money this Tuesday I'll just be met with waiting. So it's best that I take my payment in script form and as soon as it's available. From there I can use, trade or flip it for cash.


If Cliff asks me to go to the ATM with his ATM crd during the week I might also take my money back that way but I'd imagine that Cliff wold come knocking on my door once he reailized it. If he was willing to persistently wait on a cold day when nothing was owed, just imagine how he would act if he felt like he was owed something.

&nbsp;


To this point, I only spoke about the $200 that he was authorized to take from the ATM toward dope. Two minutes after that transaction another $100 was taken out. I noticed it, texted him and he denied having an idea. I thought I mis-read it then I checked my bank records at work and realized it did happen.


Upon calling Cliff on the phone he denied it, I checked the details and told him that it did happen. I said, ""you are the last person to use my debit card, just tell me now if you accidentally took the extra money out or sometihng."" He had it last, it stands to be reasoned that nobody else took the $100. 


&nbsp;

Since Cliff denied that he was the one who performed the extra $100 transaction, I said ""this is bullshit and it's impossible for me to find out..."" I then asked Cliff to explain his solution, he suggested that the gas station could check the surveillance video and show it to me. I immediately called bullshit, the gas station has no obligation to show me footage. That just made no sense.


Then I texted Cliff and told him I spoke to the Gas Station corporate hotline and lied. I said that they told me ""a police report is required in order to pull surveillance footage."" I told Cliff that I would be going to the precinct to submit a police report after work. This of course helpted changed Cliff's tune.

&nbsp;

Then Cliff tried to blame his middle, Derrick, for taking it. So he said that Derrick was out shoveling snow for money and that he'd come by in alittle bit.


Cliff said he wanted to look into Derrick's eyes to see if he was lying on the phone about not taking my money.
Around 7PM Cliff claims he spoke to Derrick. That Derrick claimed he misintepreted Cliff's words. 


&nbsp;


When I got off work I spoke to Cliff and the shit he told me on the phone while at work evolved a bit. You see, he claims that him and Derrick went to the ATM together and that he left my card in the machine. Since Derrick thought Cliff wanted to spend $300, not $200, he took it upon himself to take out $100 more. Now, Cliff did nonly get 3 buns total as far as he told me... so he claimed Derrick didn't say it at the time but that when reminded he would be bringing the rest of the order of dope later that night.


Cliff promised me that he would make this right. That if Derrick didn't take care of it that night he would go to Derrick's house in the morning. Around 3AM I spoke to Derrick on the phone and confirmed that he was not in fact dropping anytihng off to Cliff.


&nbsp;

Sure enough, the next day Cliff said that Derrick was picking up an order now and would deliver it before I had to leave for work at 2pm. I really had work at 3pm which gained me an extra hour when the delivery didn't show up.



""I'm hoping by the time you get here I'll be able to hand u what is owed. I'm getting update now I HATE dboys."" Cliff never used the term dboy until I started using it and I got it from this subreddit. Before work he also said ""Derrick just called me he's on his way to go pick up.""

&nbsp;

When I told him I'm departing soon he said ""I need ur help come quicker"", I said no because I'm not gonna rush through my shower. I'm not dirty like him. Well, I didn't say the last part but seriously why would and why should I rush for someone who already fucked me over?



Subsequently he said he took care of it and that we're now good. So I go, oh ""dd the eagle land?"" 

Cliff sates, first, ""nah not yet I'll explain later"". Then after I'm at work, ""I'm just waitin for drop off, he got it"", in response to a request for a status update.

This was around 4pm. 

&nbsp;

Around 5pm I ask, ""so he's got it but stll not back"". Cliff confirms, ""Correct, I'm epxecting him very soon."" Closer to 6 I rant that it's still not there and he says again, ""he's en route to me.""


Around 7 I say, ""is he on the way back from China?"" Cliff responds, ""No he's with his scrap metal boss dirvin back probably trinhg to ake bread. By the time you get out of work I'll have ur shit.""



&nbsp;

Upon another grumpy status update Cliff says ""I'm literally waiting now dude."" Just continued assurances it'll be here by the time I get ot of work and confirmatio of when I leave work. 



90 minutes later I get an ETA of 30 minutes. More ocmplaints from me and Cliff says, ""I'm literally sittin here waitin. I'm going to take a walk jsut to see."" Bullshit, Cliff doesn't walk unless it's a sure thing.

Finally he stops responding to my messages after work. My worst nightmares come true as a result of my coerced choice to help him out. I texted that I knew he's lying but that I don't care as long as I get my money back.


Cliff didn't acknowledge that he's a lying scumbag but he did say he was sleeping.


Via text, I just confirmed when he gets his script on Tuesday that I'm getting pills or or money. He says he's going to sell the pills instantly but I doubt it. I'm not going to not take pills when he has them and wait a day or two for money that never shows up. If Cliff has a choice of selling pills and ordering dinner or paying his debt.. his fat ass will order dinner.


&nbsp;

So maybe I'll use the pills, maybe I'll flip them but I'm more likely to get pills as opposed to cold hard cash. Maybe if I'm lucky I'll get some cash but I doubt I'll get more than $40, the majority of the debt will be paid in pills because Cliff uses his script as currency.


&nbsp;

If I decline the pills on Tuesday and demand money, there is a higher likliehood that I'll receive neither. 


This Tuesday I am waking up early in preparation to pick up Cliff's script. It will be pre-arranged the night before. If it isn't or if he doesn't answer my phone on Tuesay, I will do what he did to me this past week. I shall go to his house early and wait at his door, blow up his phone, and knock.


Hell, I have the key to his house since I sometimes walk his dog in emergencies. I'll grant myself entry as a last resort..


&nbsp;

So hopfully on Monday, I pick up his script, get some pills and later that day get money. I tihnk I'll take the entire debt in pill form. If he succeeds in selling pills, I'll just trade back my pills for cash. If he doesn't, then at least I'll have something.


Regardless of what happens this Tuesday, Cliff can and will be told to eat a bag of dicks. I'm only being cordial now to ensure that I can recoup at least some of my loss this coming week. 


&nbsp;

**I'm sorry that this post is a big step backwards.** It's like I didn't learn or listen to any of my past lessons. I just didn't think Cliff had the audacity to engage in this type of heist. I might pretend to want the pills really badly so that Cliff thinks I'm sitll in the game but my goal is simple. To recoup as much of my loss as possible by any means possible.


I suspect part of the reason he did this was because he knew this would probably be the last time I'm buying/loaning him dope and the last time I'm letting him use my card. Since it's the last time, there would be no consequence in violating my trust.


&nbsp;

I don't know if he screwed me because he could, he knew he could take advantage of the situation for the sake of his own benefit. Maybe he did it for that reason and to spite me after having to wait outside my houes for two hours. I'm sure inside his head he somehow justified his own actions.

&nbsp;


Seriously, I vow to never do aynthing for Cliff again. Once I recoup a portion or the entirety of my loss this Tuesday, I'm gonna use this incident as an example and excuse if and when Cliff begs for my asssistance in the future.


If he asks me for a favor, ""hell no buddy, I don't want to get fucked over again like you did to me two weeks ago."" Maybe I'll say, ""I'm not doing this, I don't appreciate what you did last week."" When he denies, and he will deny wrongdoing, I'll say, ""I'm not arguing semantics."" He knows he's full of shit and doesn't need me to explain it and I'm not giong to expend energy arguing such a self evident thesis.

One thing I realized though is that my Methadone clinic probably single-handedly solved my boredom problem.


It’s literally like the waiting room in that Eminem music video, I think it was „The Real Slim Shady“ back then. Some dude is kicking up a major fuss because he got kicked out of detox for smoking K2 or some other synthetic cannabinoid shit. Keep in mind he was on 130 fucking mgs, was checked into detox for abusing benzos by the MDone doc, and will now be given the boot without tapering down. On 130 fucking milligrams of MDone and with a sizeable benzo habit, all over shitty Spice. The police are called to subdue him since he’s barred out on wonky Chinese Xan presses. Some lady is missing several teeth and is actually storing € bills into her bra as opposed to her wallet. There’s exactly one person in the entire waiting room who isn’t sweating profusely. An obviously withdrawing mother is seated with her kid which heartbreakingly asks „Are these people sick like you mommy?“. The receptionist is enlightening a new patient as to the intricacies of stool samples. Never a dull moment here.
Blatant shitpost, but I just thought I oughtta tell you guys how MDone works here in Germany. This is a very US-centric subreddit but in the past people were very interested about the dope game over here. Thank God for socialized Yuropeen healthcare, this shit might literally save my life. 50mg of MDone doesn’t get me high per se, but I feel that opiate-induced contentness you feel after the initial rush from your shot has worn off.

I even started as an intranasal user, so my ROA hasn't changed, although I do plug as well (which has a similar time from dose to effects). Anyone else notice this gradual shift?

so, we all have moments when thoughts enter our minds that aren't entirely rational from a normal human beings pov. But I hope you understand my train of thought. 




I'm out of coke and money, but would like to substitute for speedballs. My roommate has some speed in the fridge and since I don't know where to come by meth (not really a thing where I live) to do a goofball, I thought I'd try to shoot a liiiiil bit of speed with my next dope shot. 




Any experiences? It's possible I just won't do it as I don't really like speed (anymore tbh lol) when snorted or ingested. But knowing it's there just got me thinking. 





I'd be interested in how long the speed high would last when iv'd, how bad coming down from it is and how the rush compares to coke. All in combination with heroin, mixed in the same shot. 




Hope everyone is well out there!



Edit: just checked the fridge and it's gone, damn it. :( He must've taken it with him to party. But that means it should be there again tomorrow. His gf doesn't like drugs and she's with him.

TL;DR: How does the extended release mechanism work for the OxyContin OP? Do you get 50% instantly and 50% continuously?

Again, I ask because I have only seen tar on here. The consistency of it is dry, shiny, and with some heat tiny particles will stick to the baggy a TINY bit (miniscule) but then it dries back up and it comes right out of the bag, its rocky but crushed.

I was definitely unlucky.  

Six months the psychiatrist changed me from ativan tablets to the undiluted liquid.  He gave me two options: IM ativan or the drops.

I'm 30 and I've *never* been offered anything injectable (and I never expected to be). But, I already do testosterone shots biweekly and I've been doing them for 11 yrs.  I have soooo much scar tissue.

I turned him down and was prescribed the drops.

Well his PA was not made aware of this.  Bottle in tow, I meet with her.  My last fill was 2/15 and it was 3/15. She gets very hostile with me about the change.  She's bitching about how I didn't need it and how I was on pain meds... I've heard it all before.

I tell her when I met her I was on fentanyl patches and liquid morphine *AND* ativan.  She had no problem then filling for it.  

This time I'm only on liquid hydrocodone... Big difference yet now she's got an issue. Telling me I'm a year post op from my spinal fusion and shouldn't still need the opioids.....

Fucking hate people like this.  I'm the genetic lottery of shit ( my PM doc's words).  I've got many painful conditions and will probably be *medicated for life*.  

She tells  me she'll renew my script but I can't get it til the 23rd...

WTF lady can you not count?!

I try and explain but she's not listening.  I then ask about something for WDs.  She tells me no and good luck.

My pharmacist is furious.  They send  my wellbutrin... She tries to contact  them to no avail 

Now I'm in benzo WD.  

My anxiety is fucking insane.  I now cannot move without the spasticity fucking knocking me off my feet.  My muscle spasms I can't kick.  My autism and ADHD go haywire!!!.

I'm miserable.  I meet with my PM doc who is livid.  He's so mad about the irresponsibility of the psychiatrists office.  He tells me I could have died.  He prescribes me Clonidine patches along with the hydrocodone and gabapentin 

So my ativan will be ready Monday.  My patches need a prior authorization so I'm not on them.

I'm over most of the WDs.  Even though my other medical conditions are in full swing I have no fatigue anymore.  I can get and keep a hard on which I've not been able to on the ativan.

My issue... I dunno if I want to get back on the ativan anymore.  I like being able to get an erection and I like not being fatigued...but my other conditions are really bad without it.

I'm at a cross road...

Td;lr: I've been off my ativan for over a week now.  My other medical conditions are really bad because of it (anxiety, Autism, ADHD, spasticity, and muscle spasms ).. *BUT* I can get and keep my erections and I've really got *NO* fatigue.

He doesn't understand how fucked up that is and said if I got offered $1,000 for each of my two cats would I sell them and I said no never, I love my cats and they love me I've had them since birth if never get rid of them, then he said what about $5,000 to throw them off a cliff. And at that point I was like wtf is wrong with you, that's a whole new level of fucked up, no way in the fucking world for any amount of money would I ever do that. 
He thinks him selling his dog is not fucked  up at all, he doesn't see what's wrong with it. He also said he'd make sure the family is nice and he would be able to visit his dog like twice a MONTH which is his reason for it not being fucked up, and it's not like he's Giving it to a shelter or an abusive home 

Here's a strawpoll I've made I told him ask anyone else and they'll tell you selling the dog would be fucked up and he didn't believe me, not only am I going to be other peopled inputs, I hope to get peoples input from this sub who knows how it is to have no money and need quick cash to score and so you don't withdrawl.

I've literally been hospitalised before when I tried to end my opiate addiction and felt like shit emotionally, but from day one I felt happy as larry with the Modafinil, no depression or sweats or anxiety... nothing. Even though I was taking higher opiate doses for longer than ever.

Why is noone talking about this?

I'm exercising, enjoying socialising again...my mental sharpness I thought had been lost forever has returned... honestly my mind is blown. 

The only downside is that sleeping for 8 uninterrupted hours is obscenely difficult, although melatonin is helping with that. I also now have to face all the shit I was using opiates to hide from and bury for all those years, which is emotionally quite difficult at times.

I guess the difference in quality can be a factor in how much people use, but that's besides the point. I wanna know how much and how often you guys use.

For me, I'll use either a blue (plugged or snorted), 0.1g of tar(smoked or plugged), or 20-40mg of #4 (snorted) on days I use. Maybe 2-4 times a week depending on what I have.

But as I have stated is previous posts, I ve been getting pain medicine for about a month now. It started with going to the hospital who gave me 5/325 norcos. Then to my PCP who also gave me 5/325 norcos and a referral to a back and spine surgeon.  
This about 2 weeks since my hospital visit. I see the back doctor, they order an MRI and give me 30x 5mg oxycodone.  
Another week later, I go back to go over the MRI, they want another one contrast so i get another order for an MRI and another script, but 61x 5mg oxycodone.  
Another week, i go in and the main surgeon is in surgery that day, so i reschedule but get another 60x 5mg oxycodone and 20x 10mg oxycontin (OP). I tell my doctor i have to fly for a work meeting which she advised against, but i had no choice. I have to do what i can do to keep my health insurance and career. Well of course i blew.  
So i get back, of course already blew through my script. I call the doctor and she says they are about to close, early since it's friday. And i could either just take my empty bottles to urgent care and see if they can give me a 3 or 4 day script since i have an appt on tuesday. Or if i can make it until monday i can come in then but still have to go back in tuesday since the main surgeon who i need to see is not there on mondays (surgery days).  
Well I guess im going to go to urgent care tomorrow and ask for a script for sunday, monday and tuesday until i can get back to see the back/spine doctor.
  
My doctor seems amazing! She is so compassionate and caring. When i was on the phone with her friday telling her i ran out of my script, she sighed and said ""i hate to say it, but i told you so. I knew you were going to be in more pain because of that plane ride""  
  
Anyway, I go in tuesday and im assuming will finally set a date for surgery or see what other options i may have. I want to tell her that when i was on the plane and i took a few more than i was supposed (which ive already told her i did) i noticed how much of a difference it made.  
I want to ask her if I can possibly up the dose of the 5mg oxycodone maybe 10mg or 15mg since the 5mg is not acting as effectively any more.

As I'm sure you all are familiar with, its fuckin hard to cum on opiates, so I'll often enjoy an orgasm before my first dose of the day.  However, if I have an orgasm before I take stimulants or opiates, I often find a marked decrease in the amount of euphoria I would expect from my dose.  And as a corollary, I find if its been days since I last had an orgasm, the high is usually more pronounced and lasts longer (especially with stimulants).  I realize that many factors go into this, but all things equal, I find isolating this variable does yield different results in my high. 

Now I know, it sounds like common sense - we all know orgasm is a chain reaction of a bunch of neurotransmitters all firing off, so if you use your stores of dopamine and serotonin on an orgasm, your brain will need time to get those back to normal levels, right? So I imagine if you take a drug immediately after, you won't have as much dopamine to work with as you would have prior to the orgasm. Since dopamine is primarily responsible for the euphoria of most drugs, I figure the decrease in euphoria is due to less dopamine available - at least, this is the basic idea behind my theory. But this is all conjecture on my part, I've never found anything scientific to base this on.

I have debated this for years in my head and from personal experience I think I have a fairly consistent answer, but I wanna hear from other people. Has anyone else found decreased euphoria from opiates (or other dopamine-inducing drugs - stims, etc) when taken shortly after orgasm? I have searched so much online for anything on this topic but can never find anything.",1521923589.0

Hi r/opiates, 

After I stopped using everyday a few years ago, I have been using heroin every now and then. I have done mostly painkillers, and have tried heroin maybe a handful of times my entire life. 

Two weeks ago, I picked some up for the first time after I moved cities. I bought a bun, paid $100, and after he left I realized the powder is completely white (I have only seen tan/brown ones). I did some research here and decided to be very, very careful as it had higher chance of being pent and I haven't used since last April.

I tried it for the first time last Thursday (9 days ago), sniffed starting from a rice sized bump into lines. I went through one stamp that night, feeling the euphoric rush at times as I did longer/bigger lines. But it seemed to last very short amount of time, maybe 10 minutes? 
It was also the first time I couldn't sleep after, and I had trouble falling asleep a few days after too. I just felt like complete shit after that night for days and ended up fainting two days after.

And last night I did it again (after a week), had a great time. Finished 1.5 stamps and were able to sleep after this time. 
But this morning, I woke up feeling sick, threw up, almost fainted, and feel a bit like a zombie. I cannot seem to be able to process anything in my brain. But the weirdest thing is though, I just noticed that I have crazy pinned pupils right now... I've never had pinned pupils that lasted 13-14 hours!! 

I honestly have never felt like this way after a night of using, but I am not sure if that is because I haven't for a while.. So I wanted to ask you guys, has any of these symptoms happen to you or did I just pick up something that is not heroin at all??



TLDR - White dope only providing very short duration of euphoric feeling (~10min) seems to be creating symptoms: difficulty sleeping for days after use, nausea the morning after, pinned pupil lasting 14 hours, unable to process things, and fainting. Anyone else have experience any of these symptoms before?",1521916627.0

Since then I've tried 4 different bags from the same guy and no matter how many I snort I never even come close to a nod or even the warm opiate blanket feeling. 



Is it better to do big lines or spread out the lines? Sniff strongly or just enough to coat my nasal passage? I shouldn't be tasting the drip 10 seconds after my line, correct? 


I did 17 bags yesterday and didn't feel anything. I'm scared of needles so I really don't want to go down that path. I get bundles for $30 which is the lowest price I've ever had from a dealer so I've been going to this guy for the past 3 months.",1521916334.0

Now, I am so afraid of being gaslighted and hit and cheated on, that I have not had sex with anyone who knows my full name or my address in 15 years... I think I am physically incapable of trusting anyone enough to put my name on there lease with anyone else 

It's just not an option.

So... What to do? Opiates. Because literally everything else I had an interest in doing it involved a partner... A close male friend or a female significant other. But having my closest friends and my only real significant other all lie to me about the most important thing to me has left me hopeless...

I want to travel -- with someone.

I want to start a business -- with someone.

I want to watch films and analyze them -- with someone.

I want to learn new skills -- with someone.

And as soon as i get sober, I'm so miserable that any potential friend would have to pick me up and get me moving... But I'm too old for that now, new friends don't just see me on the street and see what's up with me just based on my presence.

So... What the fuck? Life just sucks I guess. I felt happy on methadone, but it was poison to my physical body. I can't hold a job because when I'm sober I just move slow and think slow. I still don't have the balls for suicide. I just don't, and that's really frustrating to know, to know that I'm just at the mercy of biological imperatives at all times -- of my need for other human beings to just be near them for psychological reasons, because isolation affects me biochemically, for sex, for opiates since my brain was always fucked and I always felt miserable without them, and, finally, that I can't commit suicide because I have the survival instinct that is so strong...

I just feel like a worthless idiot. I should have been making better people than myself by now.",1521916268.0

A member of the community posted a pic of discarded needles in her neighborhood and is really bullshit about it.   I asked the group if they'd be in favor of a needle exchange program if it led to fewer discarded needles.     What I got back was:

> The people throwing needles out their car window (or throwing them as they walk by) don't do it because they don't have a needle exchange available. They are hiding what they are doing, so they want to get rid of the evidence. When they are high, the last thing on their minds is, ""hmm I wonder where I can responsibly exchange my needles?""

I'm not that negative.   I think users would prefer options.   I know most or all of you don't want little kids handling discarded needles.   What would help you?

(Journalist Inquiry),"Hi everyone. I’m a journalist who covers opioid stories for VICE News on HBO. This sub is a valued resource for me. I spend quite a bit of time on here looking for what’s not being covered by mainstream publications (and the answer is a lot). One thing that has jumped out at me, particularly when reading the fent warnings, is how the ubiquity of fentanyl has changed attitudes and behaviors for people who use.

I’m working on a segment focused in NYC and, based on my own reporting and insight from this sub, I’m struck by the way many (if not most) people take it as a given that their bags contain fentanyl. What’s also interesting is how attitudes to this new reality vary. Some seem to proceed more or less business as usual, despite the rise in ODs. But I’m also seeing more prevention strategies employed, like on-the-ready narcan, test doses, using with a buddy, etc. And I see more people trying to quit or get on MAT rather than take further risks with a bad batch.

So I’d like to put the question to this community - how have you adapted to the new normal? Has fentanyl’s rise changed how you use? I am working on a video piece, but I’d appreciate any insight even if off-the-record/background. And feel free to send me a note at seth.dalton@vice.com.",1521897876.0

And let's say sometime between 8-36 hours after my last dose, i decide to take a break and grab some H. Ignoring the fact that I should really be waiting longer, in a situation like this, should i be worried about precipitated withdrawal _at all_, or could I perhaps take a suboxone the next day, as little at 6-10 hours later. 

I know that 10 hours is probably plenty of time for some people to bounce into a decent COWS score, but the timing of my onsets tend to linger, so this would be a pretty short timeline for me. But what I'm wondering is, any high that I'm getting from the H (which I can actually get surprisingly high day of, maybe because I keep my sub doses on the low side) should really only be bound to the receptors that i have free since it's not knocking the suboxone off of any receptors. And since I have, in this scenario, taken, say 2mg of subuxone each of the three days before, my free receptors should beat low capacity. So, is it possible that taking a sub even as little as 4 hours afterward wouldn't even put me into PW, simply because that sub can only bind to a maximum amount of receptors, most of which are already bound by the previous suboxone that i took in the days leading up. maybe this doesn't make sense, and maybe they would just bind to other receptors anyway, but i'm curious nonetheless.

to preface my other question, i am a somewhat new H user in terms of comparison, but by no means am i even jokingly considered opiate naive. so my second question, unrelated to the first is, at what point in terms of hours, do i no longer have to worry about ""nodding out"" in a _negative_ way. i am prone to anxiety, so i worry about nodding out and something happening, despite the fact that i'm really not taking that much, generally. i even very, very often take benzos with my blues and subs and i don't worry at all about it because i have very high tolerances to both. but with H, i usually am too scared to do this, and often don't take any benzos even in the same day; although, on occasion, i will take one maybe 3-6 hours after my last dose, but this even scares me sometimes. 

i've kind of gotten off-topic now talking about the benzos, but anyway, i hope you all have some answers for me. i appreciate this community as i have often found great answers around here. thanks!",1522051552.0

It’s been about a month now that I basically lost all of my connections...which forced me to go through WD’s that would’ve been so much worse had I not had a good amount of gabapentin + lope on hand. It wasn’t until a little over a week after that I finally started to feel better and actually considered just quitting altogether, until earlier today that is. 

Okay, so...I get a text from one of my old plugs who practically cut me off because someone was being a snitch and he thought that someone might be me. Well, turns out he found said person then proceeded to apologize for what happened, claiming that he’s back at it and he’s already got a little somethin for me. HALLELUJAH. 
I’m a little conflicted though...while I was overjoyed in excitement, i simultaneously felt horrible that I was about to go right back to the one thing that I legitimately considered kicking just yesterday. 

With all that said if there’s any positive side to all of this, it’s that 1.) A month off gives for one hell of a tolerance break lol. 
And 2.) In all seriousness, I do want to kick this shit for good. Maybe not right at this very moment in time but it will happen and when it does happen, at least I know I CAN do it and it certainly isn’t as bad as I imagined it being in my mind.

One thing I don't understand is - does Serotonin Syndrome with tramadol occur only when taking high doses, if no other drugs are present?

I took 150 mg yesterday and 180 mg today. At one point today, I became very anxious which is not really normal for tramadol, and also felt slight tremors/tensed muscles, so I became scared of SS. However, it could be just as well possible that I got anxious and got tremors *because* I was scared when thinking about SS. I've also read that tramadol can cause anxiety because of its noradrenergic properties.

What do you guys think? Is it really possible that I'm at risk if I only took 150 and 180 mg respectively two days in a row, or I'm just hypochondriac and scaring myself? I'm kinda paranoid right now. I'm not epileptic or anything, and I don't take any medications, besides kratom which I took 3 days ago.

I don’t want textbook answers or shit from NYtimes. I want real people, real addictions, real answers. This is for a psychology paper due in two days. If you’re interested, please let me know. 

I don’t know if this is allowed here, so delete if not. Thanks dudes. 

EDIT: I’ve decided to just post the questions. If you can answer them right in the comments, that’d be awesome. 

1. How did you begin your addiction to opioids?



2. How did you feel society looked at you while you were still dealing with addiction?



3. Did you ever ask for help and that attempt was unsuccessful? Why?



4. What was your rock bottom/turning point?



5. What do you think about the opioid crisis right now? Has it always been there but has just moved into the suburbs and now it’s an important issue?



6. How do you feel about prescription opioids being handed out as a first line of medication from hospitals/doctors?



7. How do you feel society looks at people in recovery?



8. How do you feel about drug courts instead of the traditional court system?



9. What kind of loopholes have you found, if any, within our health care system in regards to dealing with addiction/getting more pain pills/etc.?



10. Any suggestions on how to help the epidemic?



11. What are your thoughts on medication like Suboxone? Do they help or perpetuate the problem?



12. How long have you been clean? How have you grown personally since your addiction? If not clean, how long have you been addicted? Have you tried to seek out help? If not, why? 




*please note that if you choose to answer these and I want to use them, I may ask you your FIRST NAME ONLY. I want no more identifying information than that.*

•Went to pick up from a guy that ive met thru a good friend

•Went to this dude twice before for Opana

•Told me to pick him up on his street, I did

•He told me to go to the store around the corner because his dude is the one that has it

•Got there and pulled in next to the car

•I gave him the money and he got out and got in the dudes car

•Then he takes off on me and the car dips out

I was pulled in and he was facing out, and chasing would have done nothing for me. Not going to waste more money in gas. Well he texted me 5 hours later saying he thought I was a cop and a whole bunch of bull. He said I could come get it but I don’t have a ride now and I said I’d have one later and he said he’d have it whenever I wanted it. He suggested he could put it in his mailbox and I could come get it, while I said I could do it in an hour or 2 and he hasn’t replied in 2 hours. 

What’s the chances he’s gonna actually give me the drugs? Think it’ll be a bunk pack just to rub it in more? It just doesn’t sit right after he did that. Does he feel bad for running off? 

Edit: he is trying a little hard to get me to meet him
He says he’ll face time me the drugs and all his gear to show he’s serious. I asked if he could do the mailbox thing tonight and he said he can’t because I might take it “and say I never got it”. He’s telling me we can talk about it tomorrow on his porch, and that he’d rather have business then a quick lick. I feel like he’s tryna steal my car next lol",1522033975.0

Now this is the weirdest part - when you put water on it it 100% dissolves clean, but it does so *clear,* with maybe a very, very, very light grey/blue tint to it.

Did good for a bit and screwed up. Told myself if that happens I will get rite back into treatment. I ended up having to wait a few days longer then I wanted to, waiting to pick up a car I had purchased so I can get back and forth to work.

I've called 6 places, no beds, long wait lists. So im going to do what I always do, show up at the ER say im addicted to heroin and suicidal (I do have 2 attempts on the books that both left me in the ICU on life support) and this garuntees me a bed. Only issue is you are stuck in the crisis unit, with MAYBE an ativan if you are lucky. Waking up dope sick in that tiny room with the bed nailed to the floor in the center of the room, blank white walls, is fucking terrifying.

So on the the bread and butter of my post...

WILL A HAND HELD METAL DETECTOR PICK UP ONE INSULIN SYRINGE?

I honestly can't remember if they want you're person or just the clothes you come in with.... My idea is double bag a small plastic cooker, my 2 bundles, and one syringe. Years ago I stayed in a dry homeless shelter and they would use a hand on us everyday, never had an issue sneaking in an insulin syringe. Any thoughts on this? It would suck to have to like be watched every time i go to the bathroom and then if I do shit out everything catch a possession charge rite?? If it does go off around my ass you think they'll know enough to suspect I've got something up there? Maybe when I see the triage nurse I will only mention feeling suicidal. That way they won't suspect paraphernalia on me if it goes off. Later in the crisis unit, a special worker comes to see you, I can let her know im hooked on dope and suicidal.

I found out in January that I am pregnant and unfortunetly was told that coming off methadone would be more dangerous and increase chances of a spontaneous miscarriage (which I've already had a miscarriage last year when I wasn't on methadone) I absolutely hate that I'm on this med while pregnant and feel like shit about it constantly. My question is what is the benefit of split dosing vs full dosing? Also if anyone has any experience on pregnancy and methadone and also babies born on methadone as I'm very concerned about this. Please no harsh judgement and attacks, like I said I HATE myself already for being on this, and tried and spoke to multiple specialists about coming off while pregnant and they all advised against it. Also , I am on this med for pain management not as a maintainance to stay of heroin or drug addiction. I unfortunetly moved to a state 7 months ago that refuses to prescribe subutex or any other med for chronic pain and just refers people to the methadone clinic. I had been on subutex for 2 plus years and done great on it and then moved across the country thinking is be able to establish care here and be able to continue on the same med and treatment plan, unfortunately that wasn't the case. Please, any positive input would be great. Thank you

Always seperately (except when I tried fent+oxy once... I was [and honestly still am] in an incredibly dark place when I made that decision). 

These past 2-3 weeks I've stopped all opes, now I have a decent amount of tapentadol to try. 400mg gets me strung out to the point of near-delirium but comes with a MUCH better ""warm blanket"" feeling than tram, at times even stronger than oxy imo. Usually when I start nodding I notice almost immediately and jump back to reality, like when you realize you're in a dream and your brain wakes you up as if to say ""fuck off you only get good dreams when I say so, the rest of this one will be a nightmare just because""

This, however, seems to have a much better potential as an anxiety/depression medication than a lot of the benzos I've tried (off the top of my head are etizolam, alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), oxazepam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam...) and literally every SSRI/SNRI/TCA I've been prescribed (one of the less competent psychs even put me on fucking daytime quetiapine, as though not being able to focus on anything and being groggy/irritable 24/7 would help with ANYTHING -_- )... I'm trying everything I can that might help since my last chance in terms of ""professional"" help after this is ECT, and after seeing my mother go through that I have no desire to potentially forget the few good memories I've made.

So, tangent over, tapentadol. Not only does it help with anxiety, it does so without turning me into an overconfident idiot like benzos do AND brings a sense of happiness and wellbeing comparable to the afterglow of a good DXM trip. Honestly it seems too good to be true... am I actually having heroic doses and putting my life in danger without even realizing? I have benzos on hand in case I start getting my seizure signs (tremors, gradual loss of control over my extremities, swinging between bliss and depression over absolutely absurd things) but so far even 600mg in a single dose without a benzo to go with it has been fine. Am I just being overly cautious or is this something I should be worried about?

Hurt my finger pretty bad the other night, blood droplets all over the damn place. I cradled my finger and rushed off to my manager to get some band aids. Bless his heart he was worried about getting me the whole first aid she bang! I then spent a good bit of time in the bathroom attempting to stop the bleeding. Good news is my finger stopped bleeding, the swelling went down, and its healing but I doubt I'll ever have a fingernail worth looking at there again. :( 

Declined to file a report, but sure as fuck to self medicated for the pain later that day at home. Dumbass mistake. 

I spend most of Friday night/Saturday morning in a blissful blackout. So blissful at some point I'd managed to sit on my lines I'd gotten lined up on the bathroom vanity, a good $50-$60 worth of mood levelers lol. I somehow managed to still have a nice pile of dope laying there so I start my Saturday morning right and do a fat line. Big motherfucking mistake! This was around 6amish, figured work isn't for another 13 hours I would be alright. 

I managed to still be nodding the next damn morning at work around 5-6am and fucking fell over only to be smacked back into reality by the painful blow my ass took from the concrete. My whole rump is black and blue I fell that fucking hard. I know I nodded out a few other times that night directly in front of coworkers and my manager... I also ended up with a big bloody gash down the side of my arm I'm still fuzzy on but it definitely happened at work! 

I ended up nod walking my home that morning, decided I needed an upper to counteract the dope. Was supposed to work that night but do to a series of conspiracy theories and misfortunes I didn't end up at work that night. I was absolutely convinced the public transit and taxi company here were somehow hacked by the same person who has hacked into my phone and creating mass Tinder accounts to fuck with me. The phones at in my hotel room were obviously tapped and being directed to this mastermind of a hacker! My old friend messaged me and I was convinced he was part of the rouse, only upon dick pictures received did I begin to realize how foolish I was being. Thankfully a friend had contacted my manager and he was even willing to come get my ass at the transit hub but in a fit of panic I left there and hightailed it back to the crib. Where I was panicking about being watched some more before finally falling into the deep slumber for hours that I needed. 

I feared all day today that I was fired, lets be real I have all the odds stacked against me with this job. But nope, here I sit on my ass in front of my manager while Redditing, sober. 

I'm living in a penthouse suite now so at least something good came of this fuckfest of a weekend!

My question is, what do you guys think about snorting tar using monkey water? My smoking technique is terrible so that's out of the question, tried it the first night and wasted a little bit. Ended up doing monkey water instead, and it got me decently high, so I'm doing it again tonight. 

I know that monkey water (and tar in general) is awfully hard on your body, but as far as I understand, snorting it 2-3 times in a week wouldn't have any real long term damage to your sinuses and nasal cavities, correct? Damage from short term snorting heals up within a few weeks/months or so iirc, no?

Been mixing it up with a few drops of water and snorting about a quarter to a third of a point every 15 minutes until I get up to a decent point, might not be as safe as smoking it but I'm not really chasing a nod or really getting to the point of being high enough where it's that dangerous.

I have seen in many documentaries of people getting heroin and pills from sketchy dealers, and I’m wondering if that is really the case for most people. ",1522124186.0

Have you been discriminated because of your race or financial status as a drug user?","So I was watching an interview from Hot 97 staring rapper Gun Play. They were on the topic of ""pill music"" due to Gun Plays new song ft Rick Ross called cheap trill which speaks on oxys and other drugs. Hot97 started speaking of the opioid epidemic, and how they do not like playing ""pill music"" in the morning. Promoting it for people that are on there way to wrk or taking their children to school is not something they feel suitable. It's not like they don't like ""pill music"", they just feel it isn't right for morning. 

Gun play replies to them as a hater lol, and that everyone down south wants to get hyped at 8am. The party just starting at that time he states. Even though he doesn't take pills he still likes his weed n coke and is a ""gangster rapper"". He goes on how this society is fucked up regardless. Which is true because if your listening to rap it's almost all ""pill music"". It's all over air even if Hot97 does not want to play it at 8am someone else will, gets heard either way.

Now this is when shit got real in the interview and really got me thinking. So he goes on about how back in the day when the minority's had a crack epidemic. All the government did was bring more over priced drugs to the hood. Just locked people up for getting high. Meanwhile now it's hitting the white people in the suburbs it's a different story. It is a now mental health issue. Your able to get help rehab etc. 

Now they want to try to fix and maintain the problem. ""Why didnt y'all help us back in the day"" guns voice. I give him props for stating the facts! Think about how many wrongly convicted because of their racial status of a drug user. It's a different ball game even now for people with color or financial status.

I sure didn’t get these pills off the street I never hung with people outside, I’ve always been and inside person around family, and he was the main one who would give me Oxycodone and play dumb and say “here make sure you give these to your mom or sell em”.

For instance if you were to have the Monoamine oxidase A enzyme within your DNA then you’re far more likely to have a certain number of behavior characteristics naturally that wouldn’t be derived strictly from environmental factors; aggression, impulsiveness, reckless, mania. If you had any sort of blue clues about mental disorders and how they counteract with with serotonin and endorphins then you would understand the they are CATALYSTS for suicide, drug addiction, criminal activity, amongst other things....which COOO COOO CATCHOOO, it sounds like from that aspect that having a certain lack of natural medium chemistry within your brain...something you CANT control....can lead towards a ton of perceptions and behaviors that a “average” person wouldn’t have access to naturally....which is why your perception is heavily skewed and misconstrued and geared way more towards your obnoxious superiority complex...since you can’t accurately understand somebody else and it seems you have a very hard time removing your emotional responses in order to rationally step into a entire different mind...I guess it’s safe to say YOU DONT know anything about psychology or anything expertise wise within any sort of field. Your lack of that talent is why your responses all come off as jaded, abrasive, cantankerous, and really annoying.

My vendor emailed me saying he's getting them but I can't find hardly any info on them when I Google it. Has anyone tried the o-dsmt and is it at all similar to the real trams in terms of strength? I'd really hate to spend 50 bucks on something that might only last me a day or two as I takes 500mg of tram for me to even notice I took it.

I've been told the first two might be fent analougs and was told as usual to stay as far away as possible but I was wondering if there's any way at all to safely dose it? My best bet I guess would be to make a liquid solution and dilute it a few times and take a drop at a time but I'm not sure. Would be my first time attempting something like this.

I got some 2MG k-pins recently that i’ve never seen before. small round white pill that simply says “C 2” — now, a quick google search showed me that they are in fact 2MG clonazepam. okay, cool. but all of my searches are telling me that they’re the “orally disintegrating” tablets. So... do any of y’all have any experience with these? I feel like they’re not nearly as strong as just a regular 2MG kpin. it could just be me, who knows. i’m 6MG deep and feel relatively fine. I mean my anxiety is completely gone and I feel “good,” but I definitely feel like I should feel way better.

I remember going there with my dad and best friend eagerly waiting for the park to open up. There was a massive crowd and people were sprinting there to avoid the 2 hour line - I remember my dad trying to keep up to me and my friend. We had to wait about 45 minutes, but it was totally worth it. I remember seeing all the other people being dropped from 20 stories up, the thriller screams, and their faces when they got off the ride. I couldn't wait and when it was finally our turn, I was nervous but extremely excited. 


It was my first time on a ride like this. After strapping in, we slowly made our way to the top. We were so high up, we could see everything: the parking lot, the water park, even how long the lines were on other rides. We stopped at the top and I was so excited for what was to happen next. 


The first time I dropped was the greatest feeling in the world. I was in free-fall, felt like I was floating - it was the first time I wasn't connected to our world, because I was experiencing a world without gravity for the first time. Then the brakes hit as we approached the bottom. My heart was pounding and I was so happy - that was the greatest feeling in the world. 


We didn't return to the Giant Drop that day due to the long lines, but after we left, all I could think about was how great it felt to be free-falling like that. The initial drop was by far the greatest part. I begged my dad to go back everyday for the next few weeks. Finally we returned and again had to race to the Giant Drop at opening to beat the lines. We were strapped back in, made our way to the top, and were dropped. 


Again, it was an amazing feeling free falling like that, but it wasn't quite the same as the first time. Words can't really explain what that initial drop felt like, when you go from weighing over 100 lbs to weighing nothing in a fraction of a second, but I absolutely loved it. That summer and the following years, I must have rode the Giant Drop 100 times and loved it every time, but it was never as good as the first time, maybe because I knew what to expect.


Many many years later as an adult, I was bored with the Giant Drop, it just didn't do what it did for me as a child. I heard about the Lex Luther Drop in California and went for a visit during vacation. Sure it was a little more expensive, but the tower was so much higher. Adult me felt like a child again riding up and then we dropped. My adrenaline was pumping and I screamed at the top of my lungs. I absolutely loved it, but again, I could never experience that initial drop like I did the first time. We rode it several times and it was a blast, but not quite the same.


I'm still convinced a higher drop would feel amazing and I could experience that initial drop like I did for the first time. I'm even willing to pay more for a higher tower. But what goes up must come down - the further you fall, the harder the brakes have to work and the greater toll on your body as you're brought to a stop. The stopping is worth it though because being that high is so good. 


In this case the brakes are like your kidneys and liver. They can only take so much and if you drop from high enough, your brakes won't be able to stop you completely and you'll come crashing into the ground. Even if you have a rough landing and make a trip to the ER, you still want to get to the top, find a higher tower because it's so much fun. 


You pay more and more to get higher and higher but you never experience that initial drop you've been craving so much. This goes until you get so high that your brakes can't stop you all the way. You come plummeting to the ground and end up 6 feet under, where you'll stay the rest of your life.

Okay, we get it, we all love candy, and sour candy in particular, but there comes a point in time when no one wants to see your picture of your SPK's that don't even have a Norco in the picture. If you wanna throw some candy in there with your dope porn shots, be my guest, but we are no longer allowing your Instagram filtered pictures of generic sour belts that don't have drugs in the picture.

We understand that not every post is going to be amazing and there is still going to be a lot of stuff that gets asked a lot/reposted, but we don't need this sub filled with a bunch of crap that has nothing to do with opiates, doesn't create dialogue, or doesn't build the sense of community.

This subreddit is home to amazing people with amazing stories and knowledge to share. Seeing a dozen posts like these a day is starting to drive many of the long time users away who come here for the quality of the content. We are doing our best as moderators to curate the content without just removing everything, and it's not easy. I hope everyone understands why this decision was made and we are doing the things we are doing. If you guys have any feedback on this topic or others similar to it we would love to hear it.

is there any way to prepare a syringe by drawing up cocaine (in water, obviously) first, then some iv-friendly, nonpolar liquid (as a barrier between the dope and coke) and then, finally drawing up your dope? so upon injection,  you would have the heroin going in first, then an ""inert"" (psychoactively) nonpolar ""wall"" (for the purpose of dividing the two) and then the cocaine...? the reason i ask is because while i love speedballs, i feel like the coke always dominates the high... and that goes for mixing cocaine with anything, iv or not. i always find cocaine to take over the buzz, which is irritating because i definitely prefer the opioid buzz over it (or anything else, for that matter). i heard from a former acquaintance that he used vegetable oil to prepare shots where two water soluble substances were separated by said oil. im just not sure how kosher it is to inject veggie oil. i was thinking something more like propylene glycol (or would that just act as an emulsifier, ultimately mixing everything together and yielding a traditional speedball?). id like to catch the heroin rush and once it begins to fade, be able to push the cocaine without having to hit a vein again w a different rig...

anybody ever try anything like this? or try using a ""saline lock"" or ""heparin lock"" to fix a needle into a vein for multiple injections without the trouble of having to hit a vein each time an iv administration is desired? especially when iv'ing cocaine, which is a vasoconstrictor, i could see this being very useful and convenient for someone looking for easily administering multiple injections over a longer period...

basically, im thinking of something with the conveniece of an injection port, without the gnarly, subdermal hardware.

I will indulge in the boy occasionally when there’s no oxy around, and when I do it’s in very small doses- as to preserve my tolerance but also because I don’t like the feeling of getting blasted on H, or anything for that matter. 

so what do y’all think? am I a dummy if I keep on buying my roxies (I have the money and prefer to pay the premium for the feeling, consistency and no fent) and also picking up a dime of some decent boy to smoke in the evening when I’m looking for a night cap? I feel like in the past when I’ve indulged and kept my doses small, I haven’t noticed much of an impact on my tolerance. I would really love to have the variety and the ability to opt for the much more sedative experience for that 10-20% of the time when I find the oxy high to be too stimulating. taking more oxy feels wasteful, I’d rather save it for the day time and use something else when I’m trying to really slow down. 

anyhow, curious to hear what y’all think. 

PS I realize this is picky but I’m genuinely trying to get other people’s opinions! I entirely understand it would be much cheaper to just switch to H full-time; I have done that in my past and am not interested in doing it again, for a whole host of reasons. this is specifically for people that use both and find it to be viable if you control yr doses.

Trashed everything like a tornado came through. She says she was sleep walking and in her dream was trying to fight off someone trying to kill her. She pulled all the drawers out and emptied them, emptied the pantry and fridge, threw every piece of furniture upstairs all over the place, threw the upstairs tvs against the wall and floor and a lot more shit. It's a huge mess. Then she went to the neighbors out of her mind and told them someone was after her and P. It's literally insane. Is this a psychotic break? Where's a Reddit psychiatrist when I need one lol? This is the first thing I've ever heard her apologize for but within 15 min she was back to cussing P out for locking himself in the bedroom to get away. ""Open the fucking door! That's my goddamn bedroom and if I can't get to my bed and make up and clothes I'm going to call the cops and have you arrested and divorce you and take your house you dumb cunt bitch!!"" Is the kinda shit she's sayin. She's just mad bc P is in there with a couple customers servin them and she can't get in to mooch. 




Ok I've posted about my crazy roommate before so here is some more. For those that haven't read before I live with a guy we will call P. He is married to J. J is crazy and delusional. 

A month ago J stole his car with no warning. She snuck his keys while he was nodded out and ran off. 2 days later she calls from a gas station to say she's lost the car keys and needs him to come get her lol. He gets a ride from my good friend wiffle and finds the keys in the center console with her nowhere around and takes the car and leaves her ass there. Later she got arrested for a warrant for probation shit. Probably while wondering around mumbling nonsense to people. She got out of jail a week or so ago and called P to get her but he wouldn't bc she also told him she wants him out of the house, which was his long before he met her, and she says she knows he and his brother bought the house with money stolen from her. She has no money and never has had money but she claims she's worth 2-5 trillion dollars. We've all tried telling her no one is worth that but she can't be convinced lol. So he wouldn't get her so she wondered around for 2 days until she went in to a middle school and told the principle she had been kidnapped and had just escaped. The principal called the cops and they got her and brought her here. When she got here she busted out my fucking window. Not to get in but ""bc the cop said she had to or else they would search the house"". I have no clue why she really did it. 

Since she's been back she's been crazier than ever. She claims she's him morrisons wife and she wrote all the songs for the doors. Whoever she's into at the moment she claims is the reincarnation of Jim Morrison and whoever she doesn't like she claims is the reincarnation of Charles Manson. She doesn't understand reincarnation bc some people she claims is Jim morrisons reincarnation were alive while he was alive and Charles Manson just died. 

Lately she's been hitting on me hard. P went out of town a few days ago and while he was gone she hit on me a ton. Said she expected us to have super hot sex the whole time he was gone and that she'd make sure I wouldn't get anymore drugs until I gave her some dick. Then last night when I got home from work she woke up and saw I had food from work and said ""I'll give you a blowjob for a piece of that food"". I ignored her and she said it again so I gave her a piece of the food and she asked when would I want the bj. I said no thanks and she said I couldn't decline that I agreed by giving her the food. Lol. P was right there next to her but he was in and out of consciousness and ignores her a lot. She also made a bunch of other comments like saying she bets I'm better in bed than him and have a bigger d etc. also recently I shaved off my beard and she's been crazy obsessed since then. She goes on and on about how good I look and how much the last chick I was with, who she's crazy jealous of, didn't deserve me and shit it's crazy. At the same time though she tries to hook me up with people. Sometimes she still suggests her damn underage daughter (who she now claims is her granddaughter bc her mom is actually her daughter somehow though she's 72???). This chick came by to pick her friend up a few days ago and was kinda flirty with me and J said when I wasn't in the room the chick said she wants to fuck me bad. The chicks tried getting in touch with me ever since but I have a hardcore addiction to IV coke+heroin which really takes up all my time and demands all of my attention so I can't really make time for a social life but J won't drop it. She keeps going on and on saying how good for me this girl would be and how good of a chick she is and how much better than my last gf she is etc. If J isn't demanding I give her my dick then she's trying to talk me into giving it to the girl from the other day or my pick of 1 of her daughters. It's really really weird. I just want to lock myself in my room and bang speedballs. 

J also has been claiming that her and trump are business partners and that her money is taking so long because of him. For a while she was claiming trump was her brother. Lately she's been saying she's turning into a snake but no longer claims she's an alien. For a few days she said I am her soulmate and we are evolved beings capable of having such amazing sex that regular humans couldn't even comprehend it if only I'd agree. All day today she's claimed meg Ryan is stalking and harassing her. She is completely crazy and has taken to following all her crazy stories by saying ""it is the truth!"" Or ""it's scientifically proven"" or ""I have proof! Do you want to see it!?"" But if you say yes she makes up some excuse to why she can't show it. She's also still snorting tums saying she's metaphysically transforming it to boy and girl. 

Well thinking of this is making me worry I might catch her craziness so I'm done for now but I will leave you with a messenger she sent a bunch of us a few days ago. Remember the person who wrote this claims to have ""a perfect IQ"" and was ""a prodigy child"" and is a doctor, lawyer, pharmacist, comp programmer and secret agent among other things. 

""Charles Manson P cut my jim baby out Jim burn it chris pop pop the trauma amnesia I think I J Marie pop pop (she calls her mom pop pop for some reason) try protect her we live jim twin not lil red head hitler eva our parents Bauer Braun they cia relocated""

Lol

"" u can not impregnate shape shifter just eggs"" 

""Trying bust P I am mba and attorney you intrapment(her spelling ha) I'm not prosecute not asking for back it bait""

She sends out crazy messages like these to groups of ppl every time she gets ahold of his phone lol. 

She's legit crazy and I have no fucking clue what to do so I just politely nod and say ok and I don't try to argue or call her out on her bullshit anymore. ",1522223558.0

Also help with determining if a blue I got was pressed,"Hey, as far as opiates go I’ve tried: oxycodone/Percocet/Roxicodone (blues, 30s, and all others), hydrocodone, codeine #3 and codeine cough syrup (Actavis & hi-tech), OxyContin (OP and OC), and tramadol. Of these, the only ones that have ever actually gotten me considerably high were oxycodone/Percocet, Roxicodone, and OxyContin. I’m also pretty sure that once I got a blue 30mg roxi that was pressed with h as I’ve done opiates enough to know that within about ten minutes I feel a roxi but that particular one was almost white and it chipped when I bit into it, then it took nearly an hour to hit me and the high was extremely strong even though I only took half and it was much more body oriented and sedated than I’ve ever felt from oxy. Anyway, how do other opiates compare? Particularly, Opana (oxymorphone), hydromorphone, and h? How would I know if the blue I got was oxy or h? Thank you! I’ve never had a blue chip when I bit into it and they’re always a much more blue tone. Granted the pictures online of this pill were much whiter but they still had a blue shine. If it helps I’m from Long Island NY and here’s a link to the pill inscription: https://www.drugs.com/imprints/30-m-8232.html
Mine also wasn’t speckled like they almost always are which was kind of weird. I was thinking it was possible that maybe it was an expired pill and that’s why it chipped and took longer to kick In than usual. I just took a 10 and I felt it within ten minutes so I really don’t get how 15mg would take an hour to kick in for me. Thank you!! Also the reason I’m thinking H is because the girl I get them from is addicted to dope so it seems the most plausible explanation. and I’ve heard fentanyl is much more of a head high. The pill wasn’t like dumb strong but it kind of scared me at first because of how hard it hit and I’ve done more than one 30mg before and not had a problem when I was more into them. Now I do 15mg usually Once or twice a month.",1522223282.0

They sell tablets called Temegesic 0.2mg (1/5th of 1mg)

Some of the countries that sold or have sold Temegesic over the counter are: Mexico (though through loopholes), Thailand (removed from class D therefore no longer to be able to be sold over the counter in around 2015 i believe) 

Anyways,

They are used for pain primarily.

But there are no instances of abuse, overdose, or diversion

I am unsure of the pricetag

But if it was to be developed wholesale , and bupe becoming more available in general in many different forms (production of bupe per year has to be increasing)

would probably be able to offset the costs


Many countries offer some sort of Opiate over the counter, and Buprenorphine may be the way to go ,

it would prevent withdrawals, and if someone needed something for pain relief it would be able to be easily acquired . 

it would be dispensed similarly to codeine and dihydrocodeine , similar substances 
or like in the USA, dispensed similarly but with more strict guidelines (i.e. the patient has to show ID & sign form for each purchase of the med)

But it would make the med widely available to everyone

Even those whom cannot afford it

Possibly allow people to purchase it with foodstamps or ebt card

It would most likely stop people from going out of their way, to cop something like a roxy, which may contain fent in it, due to the war on opioids.

Nothing in the new documents about opioids, reference anything akin to this except for the expansion of the Suboxone program.

At least that’s what I tell myself before I experience that desperate anxiety that precedes coming to the conclusion that I usually come to, that those things I told myself I wouldn’t do, my standards; were soon to be broken.

I didn’t have a penny to my name, unemployment cheques only come in once every two weeks, so there is 12-13 days between cheques where I had zero funds. I would usually drive a working girl around during that time and she would help me out but we were in the midst of some petty argument about something, likely dope. As with most junkies, my universe was heroin centric and every problem I had, as well as every brief glimpse of joy or glimmer of hope was likely rooted in a poppy field half way across the world.

My dealer at the time was this washout drunk named Pat. He rarely left his house, which was ideal because I could dictate when I saw him, it was just a matter of getting there. He was in his mid-fifties, maybe 5’6”, with stringy, long hair tied into a greasy ponytail that ran 3/4 of the way down his back. He masked his insecurities with arrogance and alcohol, so it was best to hit him up during the day, as he was usually belligerently intoxicated by dinner time.

I had arrived at an impasse in my drug use, I needed heroin but could not afford any. I nearly accepted my fate and in the process of almost resigning my efforts, I washed down five 0.5mg generic Xanax (I had a script from my doctor). I think it was at that exact point in time that the wheels inside of my skull began to redline and with that thought, I dialled up Pat and asked if he would trade a point of H for a bottle of vodka...

I was on the move, it was time to hone my shoplifting skills. For all of my planning and preparation, this scheme went horribly. I was caught red handed inside of the store by the clerk but I did not let that stop me, I walked right past her and jumped into my car with 26 ounces of Stolichnaya and sped off... phew, that was close.

This part of the trip is a little hazy but I still have all of the necessary components to make a comprehensive story. I was well on my way to seeing Pat, actually due to the benzodiazepines I had actually passed my turnoff and ended up going the wrong direction. I didn’t realize this until I smashed into the car ahead of me at a stop light. That woke me up. The people in the other vehicles had their windows rolled down, telling me to stay off my phone, the jokes on them though because I was actually sleeping, it just looked like I was playing Candy Crush. The dude in the other car was totally unconcerned, his vehicle was fine. Mine was pretty crumpled but still drivable. He told me not to worry about it and left without exchanging information.

I did a u-turn at that intersection to get going in the right direction again only to be greeted by three cop cars in my rear view mirror. I thought I was going to jail. There was drug paraphernalia from the needle exchange, an open beer (I don’t even drink) and a stolen bottle of vodka in my back seat. 

I pulled over, answered all of their questions and all they did was give me a ticket for open container and a 24-hour driving suspension. My car was also impounded, which in this case was a given and probably saved my life. They knew I was a junkie because of the current charges I had on file and they were all very nice to me, they even offered me a ride to the barbecue I said I was going to, the one that didn’t exist. I asked one of the officers if I could get this bag of groceries and my bottle of vodka out of the car and they were cool with it, except the cop pulled the bottle out and set it on my trunk before leaning back in to grab the bag with food in it. The bottle wobbled as this large police officers weight shook my suspension and in the blink of an eye, that ill gotten bottle of booze was smashed all over the curb.

The cops dropped me off in the hood where Pat lived. It’s nearly impossible to steal from a liquor store in this neighbourhood because the shop owners deal with losers like me on an hourly basis and there was no way I could just skate past one of these clerks, bottle in hand, without encountering hostile resistance; not to mention the police car that just dropped me off likely wasn’t far away.

So I walked to Pat’s anyways, empty handed and hopeless. Pat never liked me, he tried to act all alpha male in group settings and he just generally treated me like a threat or less than or something. So I wasn’t expecting much when I stood there in his alleyway telling him the story you’ve been reading up until now. Miracles do happen though and he granted me a very small front. I gave him that bag of groceries from my car and hightailed it over to the ma and pop pharmacy that sells individual syringes for a dollar, snagged one of those and then went to use the washroom at Value Village to get this hard earned heroin circulating through my body to cut through the tension and stress wrought from the days events.

It was like I floated right over to housewares, pocketed a spoon, and then buzzed right through the door jamb of the washroom but not before I noticed the baggie on the floor. Apparently this shot was going to be a goofball because some tweaker dropped their stash on the way out. I prepped that shot on autopilot, only looking up once, as I met my gaze in that bathroom mirror, I took a gulp of air, held my breath and shot that solution into the only consistent vein on entire body—my jugular— I exhaled after I slammed it home, capped my needle and...

... I blinked my eyes open and I was on the ground, between rows of cars in the parking lot, gasping. The left side of my jacket had lit on fire at some point and there was a gaping hole where my hoodie used to be, i was fine though, aside from the singed outerwear. For the rest of the day, I drank 40 oz. beers with this aboriginal guy with one leg, met some girl who had cheques from her ex boyfriend that we cashed through my account and each ended up walking away with around $500 (cheque cleared too). Got myself a respectable amount of heroin with that money to enjoy the rest of my birthday with. 

That story was close to where I found my bottom. A couple of months later I was in treatment for 30 days and have maintained pretty good— not perfect— sobriety since. I went to go volunteer at the public library as part of my recovery when I came home and they require a criminal background check. I was arrested when I went to go and pick up my paperwork, there was an arrest warrant issued for me, for theft under $5000 on a $28 bottle of liquor.

I sell half my script to a friend and his wife for a shit ton of money. I sit at home (30 years old and retired) and just play videogames like fortnite and Farcry 5 and just have a blast. 

My roommate that doesn't get Doctor scripts is really going off the deep end. He's broke into my safes. Somehow finds my meds and takes enough for him to get high that day. He knows he can just ask me but the cravings just take him over and he feels embarrassed. It's starting to cut into my monthly extra gaming money and it's pissing me off so as much as I love Opiates I also hate them for what theyve done to my bestfriend in the whole world. He has literally saved my life on 2 occasions.. any tips on what to do would be greatly appreciated.

Our middle owed us money and we went to pick it up today. He instead took us to get dope for free to call it even. 

After he came back out, we snorted our bits and were feeling pretty nice but then this dude just went completely unconscious in the back. I always fuck with him and he fucks with me too but after a minute or so I could tell he was NOT joking around. Obviously not a funny joke either way.

He must have went into the house and shot up while we were waiting outside.

I’m just glad he’s alive and that we found the ER fast enough in all that panic. The nurse told us we did a good job and I know we did the right thing but FUCK. I’ve never had to go through anything like this.

My dad and I live in Tennessee. Dad is in a wheelchair and on oxycodone for chronic pain. There's a certain number of pills he can take per day, but sometimes he uses less. When he goes to the pain clinic, he's supposed to show how many pills he has left in the bottle, but he's been secretly stashing any unused ones away for years. The reason he does this is because every once in a while bad weather will force either the pain clinic or the special transportation he needs to close down on the day of his appointments, and then he has to be rescheduled later. He had to go without pain pills for several days because of this once and swore he'd never go through it again.

Anyway, the issue is that my dad had about 30 days of extra pills at the beginning of this month and for the first time ever he forgot to get his refill at the pharmacy. So now there is evidence that he went 15 days without a refill. If the pain clinic is able to look at the pharmacy records (edit: or looks at the fill date on the bottle), they'd obviously know something is wrong here and that he had extras he was hiding. My dad has been freaking out ever since the realization that he could be discharged from the pain clinic over this, and that's why I've come to you guys. Is stashing pain pills like this illegal? Will the pain clinic cut him off from his pills? What do you think he should say when he comes in for his next appointment?",1522189410.0

Which means, I now no longer have a pain doctor. This was super fusterating and with just a month to find one I freaked out a bit. I finally was able to snag an appointment for the 2nd of April with someone so hopefully, that goes well.

Simultaneously I started to flare super badly. Vomiting violently multiple times and having bad bowel movements. I couldn't handle it. I went down to the ER and ended up being admitted because my labs were all over the place. Since my pain specialist is no longer my doctor I got assigned to the regular in-house pain team here at the hospital.

I realized I was essentially abusing and go through my script way fast taking closer to 30mgs of oxycodone versus the perscribed 10mgs. Bad. I know, but I was really trying to avoid being in the hospital and I ended up here anyway.

Well, as you can imagine I was very nervous to talk to the in-house pain team about this. i explained to the doctor, ""I was perscribed 10mgs but was really needing 30mgs in a day and now I'm flaring and its hard to keep it under control"" to my surprise he organized my pain meds to match what I was used to versus what I was prescribed and has promised to send me home with a comparable script. He also recommended I do a ketamine infusion. Which, I am now scheduled to do tomorrow. I'm super nervous about it, but hopefully, all goes well.

On top of that, I should be getting some good recommendations for pain specialists. So, that's a bonus/plus too.",1522184812.0

The best example would be another roommate of mine. Not the one who laments his Marijuana withdrawals, but the one who developed an unhealthy obsession with me and tries to make me fall in love with him. Well, I almost pity him. Speedballs are hard to compete against. 




I once told him I had a problem with shooting speedballs, but he obviously doesn't understand as he doesn't connect the dots between my being hung over or high as fuck.

Tuesday I left the house, walking as fast to the ATM as my short legs would carry me , withdrew the little cash I had left until my credit card was maxed out again and hit up the dope and coke boys. 




Surprisingly time I didn't even have to wait that long. The dboy is right at the spot, waiting for me when I arrive. The universe obviously wants me to get right fast or is there any other way to interpret this? Even the nervous, middle aged coke man, who deals out of his car, without the knowledge of his wife, waits on the spot when I arrive. As usual, the engine is running. Would he take me on a wild police chase if cops were to show up or is it just general paranoia or laziness? Another mystery I might never solve. He has kids my age and always tries to make awkward small talk. When I get in the car, his wife is on speaker, yelling at him in Turkish. He puts his finger to his lips and my 'Hi' thins out. I wait and fumble out the money as he tries to weakly justify himself. Not that I understand a word, but the tone is universal. He hands me the coke, I hand over the money. He asks 'until tomorrow?' I shrug and say 'I don't hope so.' and am gone. 




What I hate about this specific spot is that there is no bigger restaurant or cafe where they have multiple stalls in the restrooms. If there are only one or two stalls, the employees know who went in and how long they've been in there. Not to mention other customers knocking. Which is the worst. I won't hit any faster if you stress me, bro. 




Slight wd's creep with cold fingers over my skin as I shudder. That's the result of oversleep ing and missing maintenance. Instead of facing a half hour train ride home with worsening withdrawals I decide to pay a visit to to a consumption room that's one train station away. I hate going there but I need new equipment anyways and fending off overly helpful social workers is worth getting well sooner than later. I hate how they treat me, or people in general. I know that the usual clientele aren't the creme de la creme of humanity, but getting talked down to is really annoying. Especially when they assume your vocabulary doesn't extend beyond a toddlers. In addition I get all the shocked looks and judging glances as I look like a 12 year old despite my 25 years. I hate it. 



The young guy at the counter can't even talk straight as his whole attention is consumed by mustering me in surprise. 'I'm sorry I have to ask, but how old are you?' Gah. I tell him what he needs to know and enter the shooting room. Or at least I think I do. First I open the wrong door and a surprised girl, foil in hand, straw in mouth stares back at me. 'Sorry. Wrong door', I mumble as I close the door and proceed to the right room. Luckily I'm the only user present. The overseeing nurse is talking with another employee about her neighbors and shakes her grey mane in indignation. Apparently a very mean couple lives next door to the apartment she recently bought. I pity her quietly. That's the problem with buying apartments. It's easier to get rid of a spouse than of your neighbors. Still, I'm determined to buy an apartment. Soon. By the end of this year I'll have my bachelors degree. I scoop the brown powder in the spoon and throw some citric acid on it. Next year I'll be working full time and will earn enough to save up some money. Maybe even enough to support using and saving. I drop some water on the mix and light the tea light I always carry in my kit. In two years the masters course I already enrolled in will be over and I'll be ready for a PhD. The solution is a clear brown now. I douse the candle and scoop up some coke that I've crushed in one of my discarded flashcards and add it. Stirr again, throw the cigarette filter in, draw it up. Now I'm focused. Not even thinking of apartments or listening to the nurses chatter. Tying off my arm with the battered red tourniquet wondering how long it'll be before I need to get a new one. No matter. The short needle pierces the swollen spot on the inside of my underarm, right before the elbow, where a dark purple track sits. Looks like my arm got slit there. The many hundred individual pokes blend into the thick scar. Still, I poke again, draw blood out of this cushion of tissue. I don't even want to know what's happening there under my skin - this vein is more than busted. Dark red blood gushes into the rig. That's all that counts. I push down the plunger and my surroundings become very distant all of a sudden as this very peculiar feeling of heroin and cocaine rushing through my veins sets in. My ears are ringing a little, I breath very deeply and controlled as my pulse explodes. Too bad the rush doesn't stay longer. I close my eyes and enjoy the intense seconds before I can breath normally again. 





How am I ever supposed to quit this? 





When I get home I hole up in my room with my audio book. Red rising 2.  I prep a shot for the next day which is easy as long as I have enough to spare. It worked well enough the last weeks. I always kept a shot for the morning. By the time 11pm rolls around, I need to know how the book ends. I keep dancing around the inevitable. Me finishing the whole stash instead of saving some for the next day. First, I use up the filters and leave the stash alone. Then I tell myself that I'll just feed into my cravings if I have only one shot tomorrow and that I should use everything up right now. The sooner I'm out the sooner I can start recovering, right? I try to trick myself but soon give up. In quick succession I go through the familiar steps again and again until I'm cooking out the filters for the fifth time. The solution is almost completely clear. It looks like I'm shooting water. Almost feels like it, too. I shake my head at the sheer stupidity of my behavior. It feels like it's hardwired into my brain by now. Get up, pick up, shoot up.  I should take a break. I need to take a break. My veins need a break, too. Tomorrow I'll start recovering. From tomorrow onward I'll stick to the maintenance. But who knows what will happen when the next paycheck comes in?







I sleep until 5pm on the next day after shooting the night away. My head feels like a train wreck. When I meet my roommate shortly in the kitchen he seems sulky towards me. This can only be because I didn't reply to his text. He texted me some hours ago if I wanted to watch some series. I'm too hung over to say anything beyond a weak Hi. He replies in kind. He doesn't even ask what's up with me or why I didn't reply. He has this specific 'Why don't you love me already, I'm so nice'-look on his face. I hate it so much, but ignore it for the sake of peaceful coexistence. This guy really has a hard case of Mr. Nice Guy Syndrome with a side dish of delusions. A girl's smile makes him think she's up for marrying him. 





After I grab some toast I strategically withdraw back into my room, straight into bed. Talk, they say, communicate what's up with you! But if that's the attention the communicated fact gains I could've saved myself the breath. Though I have to admit that I wouldn't want anyone to bug me about it. Just acknowledging that I'm hung over and not concluding my being so quiet related to him would be nice. I don't know what he thinks speedballing implicates. Maybe he doesn't think about it at all. Maybe he's so absorbed with how I see *him* that he forgets I'm a person, too. Not only a canvas for him to project his desires on. Ever since he confessed his love for me things move from a majorly awkward silence to slightly awkward small talk, where he tries to impress with weird fun facts. I wish he never said anything. But what can I do. I don't want to or can't afford to move out. And I can live with it. And he can, too, apparently. I'm so exhausted that moving into a more comfortable position seems like work. I slip back into sleep, thinking about how much I hate being this hung over, swearing to myself that I'll never spend another cent on cocaine.

and areas where BTH is abundant already know of this process to turn your tar into powder. I wrote this out in another thread and have had a lot of people message me and ask if this actually works. So this guide is for them. Cheers and happy nods you all!

* Black Tar Heroin 
* Baking POWDER
* Empty screw top Tylenol or similar bottle (Don’t use the orange medication bottles you get from the pharmacy, they break easily)
* 2 Clean nickels (soak in rubbing alcohol for a couple mins before using... money is dirty!!)

** The ratio of product you’re gonna use is 2:1  So 2 parts of baking powder to 1 part of BTH**

**1.)** Take the empty screw top Tylenol bottle and add the correct ratio of BTH and baking powder. 
**2.)** Now take the 2 clean nickels that you just sanitized and cleaned with alcohol and add these to the bottle 
**3.)** Now screw lid back onto bottle and shake vigorously for 2-3 mins
**4.)** Unscrew lid and look inside, you should have a powder that is anywhere for dark tan to light tan, this is depending on how dark your tar is the begin with. 
**5.)** Dump out your powder and scrape the remaining powder off of the nickels
**6.)** Now rail some fat lines and catch a heavy nod... Cheers! 

** You want the powder to be uniform in color and consistency i.e. the powder should look and feel the same throughout the entire batch. No hot spots (darker spots in certain areas) **

I hope this helps everyone who is interested. I have been using this technique for years now. It makes using BTH extremely easy. You can take it go, you can chop out monster lines, etc whatever. I usually put some in a small ziplock bag with a straw inside, so When I’m driving or on a job site I just stick the straw in real quick and toot away!",1522177438.0

My sister is a germaphobe and a hoarder. Weird combination, right? Her house is littered with latex gloves, used baby wipes, and opened bottles of hand sanitizer. She learned this behavior from our hoarder mother. My sister lives with her husband, their 2 young children, and our mom. The house is disgusting. Recently she offered me money to come clean. Being in active addiction, I welcome any odd jobs that end with cash in my hand, so I picked a weekend, even took off work on Monday (I work a 9-5 career of my own) and came down to visit/clean for 3 days. 

I did a really good job. Proud of how much I was able to do but hooooooly shit- the place was a disaster! Kids toys, used cleaning supplies, month old fig newtons, old mail... just so much garbage and general shit everywhere. I must’ve thrown out at least 10 black garbage bags- and I only cleaned 3 rooms! 

My sister and her husband have a lot of money. They are both doctors (tho my sis is currently out of work to raise their kids). This means my sister is constantly buying stuff. I threw out things that were unused just because they had gone bad or because she had so many of the same item already. I just don’t understand how people live this way. It’s embarrassing to even be around. 

I helped clean my mothers room too. Growing up we never got along but as an adult I bite the bullet and act cordial because I know she will never be able to have a civilized convo about everything that was wrong with my upbringing. This weekend I cleaned so much trash from her room while she just sat and watched tv. 

I hate this side of my family. All they do is eat, buy crap they don’t need, and watch dumb tv shows. I tried so hard not to judge and just clean as that’s what I was paid to do but the last day there I couldn’t keep it together. I didn’t blow up, but I did make some remarks about how my sister, who doesn’t even work, isn’t able to “find time” to clean (or even pick up after herself?)

I know I’m a junky with issues of my own, who am I to judge.. I just... I’m not really sure what to do. I apologized to my sister for being rude to her. She accepted but didn’t apologize back. I am thinking of going no-contact with this side of my family (at least until they wave money in my face again). This was hardly worth the couple hundred i got, though. The cleaning itself while gross, was easy... the family tension? Not so much.

Anyone else have hoarders in their family? How do you deal with them? It’s hard bc they get so upset when you so much as mention it....

Luckily my moms hoarding had the opposite effect on me and I own very little and keep what I do have clean. This only makes their lifestyle that much more foreign to me the older I get.

My aunt has been through a ridiculous number of surgeries. Its a family joke to call her Frankenstein's monster because of how cut up she was. We were talking about prescription pain meds and apparently she's been addicted for 6 years.

My younger sister just had surgery, and she has never fucked with anything besides alcohol before.

I try to promote safe usage, but some people do not seem to care as there are no readily-available alternatives to dirty/shared needles. (And this is affecting more than just opiate users.)

I desperately need help, for others and myself.....so if anyone can assist in the same way as Tracey has in the past with others, or if anyone knows her Reddit username (or any other methods of reaching her), PLEASE let me know as soon as possible by replying or sending a private message.

shorthand background::  i love opiates; for many years i was taking upwards of 150mg of oxycodone, which naturally created quite the habit/enjoyment of said chemicals.  mmm, i remember the pink dust well...  during this time i was **aware** that it was not good, but life was much worse, so boom bam boom there goes my early 20s.  

i stopped at 23, never went into withdrawl from a 100-180mg daily habit (AMA) but that is a different story... this one has a point.  

so here is the thing;; while i miss these chemicals **deeply**, i miss the life that i never had much more.  what i mean by this- even if i word to start up again, regardless of how fucked i could get there would always be that pit of **aware despair** inside - the pit that holds the possibilities of what i could do, could be and **could feel* ... 


 this is not a classic case of ""you were just ready to quit"" , as to this day i still dislike life generally, am always looking for an escape, am afraid of relationships being broken and ultimately still am equally confused as i was back then.  

for years i thought the chemicals outweighed everything- happiness, sadness, everything in between.  now i know they are so powerful, the most powerful,, but is the inner sense of lack of accomplishment, true excitement, true joy, true healthy relationships with others and with the self potentially more ""necessary"" to ones inner journey than to feel good???  this is tripping me out, idk.

I wanted to share a story with you guys about one of mine. This dealer is definitely a type of dealer you don’t usually come across and I guess you could say I lucked out. 


His name is Dan. 

My boyfriend and I met Dan a little over a year ago. Not last winter but the winter before. Boyfriend and I were on the streets, staying in hotels, or friends houses for a minute at the time. We were staying at our friend’s house, Louis. 

Now, Louis’ house was the ultimate trap spot pretty much. Louis’ Mom just recently passed actually and Lou’s brother is a piece of shit and sold the house so Lou had to move out. Lou actually got charged with ‘operating a drug house’ which I didn’t even know was a charge? His house was always a drug house tho. There were two buildings, 1 was the house, the other was the garage. Garage was where you would always catch people sleeping cause they had no where to go, or nodded off with a damn needle in their arm. Louis used to be one of our closest friends actually. Not too many people are trustworthy in the game, but he trusted us and same with him. 

Anyways, lol. We were staying in the garage at the time. This chick Brittany would always be there. She started selling us some black one day. Which was weird, cause she never had shit. She was basically sleeping in her car or at Lou’s or at another dboys house named Hawk. So we just thought it was weird how a bitch with nothing was selling all of a sudden. Figured she was middling or something. She tried acting like she was doing big things and shit until we found out she was just sleeping with/dating her dboy. One night she came over to Lou’s and she was telling me how she has to drive to X to reup. A few hours go by and she came back. She randomly just spurts out a question to me about reupping while her dboy is in jail etc etc. So that’s when we found out she wasn’t really dealing she was just sleeping with her dboy. Her dboy went to jail for something small and he was having her do everything for him to keep raking in the cash while he was in there. Thought it was hella funny how hard she was trying to stunt until she spilled the beans lol. 

A week or so goes by....and we hit Brittany up to pickup. She says yeah come to so and so hotel. We go and meet her and she asks us to take her to Safeway so we oblige. Drive her back to the hotel. I think we stopped staying at Lou’s or maybe not I can’t remember but we needed to shower really bad so we asked her if it was cool if we could shower in her hotel room. She says “uhm maybe. The guy I’m staying with will probably be okay with it. He’s just set in his ways ya know? Let me go ask” We start getting our clothes and whatever ready and she comes down and it’s cool but she warns us again “My dude is cool. But like I said he’s just set in his ways and can be hotheaded so just to let you guys know.” Were like okay whatever. Get up to the room and we get introduced to Dan. 

Everybody introduces themselves blahblahblah. 
Now Dan is not what I pictured when Brittany was talking about her dboy. Idk what I pictured really but Dan is just kinda funny looking hah. He’s 37-38. He’s maybe 5’7 with a really bad hunchback.maybe weighs 150. He’s white and has like gingerish hair. He reminds me of like an evil leprechaun kinda 😂 

So my boyfriend and I go do our thing together in the shower. Get out and Dan says he’d like it if we sit and kick it for a bit. Hands us some scratchers and tells us to scratch away. Throws down some black on foil. He’s cool haven’t seen his temper yet. He’s gonna go sell someone a sack downstairs and go grab a meth pipe from Brittany’s car. He comes back up and starts yelling about how he spilled root beer on him and they start fighting. So we decide we’re gonna bounce. It was like two weeks of drama after that. 

Brittany would hit me up to hangout cause she didn’t wanna be around Dan. Bitch about his temper. Pretty much just got her side of the story so she made it seem like he was a dirtbag who eventually put his hands on her. Last day I saw Brittany she was staying at Dans dads house with him. She had to turn herself into a program and was detoxing at the house. Dan asked us for a ride or two and bought some bars  from us for her. They ended on bad terms though. I guess she snuck into his dads house with one of her girlfriends to get her clothes and stuff and dans dad woke up and was like wtf. They took stuff that wasn’t even hers like clothes and shit but just totally out of pocket. 

That same week my boyfriend gets arrested. I was totally barred out all week on one of my Xanax binges. We were sleeping in my car at the time and idk why I was asleep in the backseat lol but that’s the last thing i remember. I wake up to my boyfriend saying “Wake up! Cops! Getting pulled over” I sit up really confused and I’m just like wtf where am I. “Where the fuck are we?! Babe what the fuck!! What time is it?!”  I’m looking out the windows, and I didn’t recognize the area. 


Turns out we were in a few towns over. Only like 20-30 minutes away from our city. Not far at all. It was like 5am when I woke up to us getting blurped 🚓. Reason why we were in this town was because I guess my boyfriend couldn’t sleep and he wanted to get a head start for that day to hustle. We usually go out of town and drive city to city to hustle. He boosts and we also do returns. Our city is just burnt. All the stores either, recognize my boyfriend, or they just refuse to do returns for anyone around here now. The epidemic is really bad here and all the junkies blew every store the fuck up and the stores caught on. So yeah, he was just restless and wanted to get an early start for the day so decided to drive a few towns over. He had a warrant out so that’s also why I was so upset when I woke up to that. Before the cop came to the car we told each other we loved one another he’ll call me blahblahblah. We don’t like to bullshit the cops if he’s got a warrant or cause we’re on probation. We just tell them before they run our names from the start cause it makes shit a lot faster and easier than playing dumb. Fucking cops gave me a ticket for not wearing a seatbelt. So mad about that. I was asleep and we were in a residential area anyways. They didn’t find any drugs or anything so no new charges either they were just dicks. Reason why they didn’t find the black was because at the time we had a silicone dab rig. In the bottom of the dab rig there was a built in silicone container the ones for wax and shit. Well we’re in Cali so cops never trip on our dab rigs when we get pulled over. But we had over a gram in the stash container and since the cops don’t trip on the dab rigs they’ve never even touched ours in all the times we’ve been pulled over. I was sweating so bad tho thinking they were gonna pick it up and inspect it lol they didn’t tho. 

Here’s where I start the whole reason why I started this story lol

So after the cops took my boyfriend and let me go it was like 6am. I’m still all confused at this point not knowing where to go. I texted Dan cause he’s an early riser. “Hey dude Justin got arrested and shits a long story but hit me up when you’re awake” He calls me like thirty minutes later and tells me which hotel he’s at and I swing by before he has to check out. I drive back to our city which isn’t far and make it to Dans hotel. We do a few dabs and I explain what happened. He tells me the falling out with Brittany yadayada. I guess she tried to steal an ounce of black from him when he was sleeping. He caught her. She threw an unopened soda can at his head and he pinned her against the wall. When she told me he put his hands on her she left those details out. 

A week goes by in a drug induced haze staying at Lou’s or in my car. I was also staying at one of our dgirls houses actually. She ended up doing me hella dirty tho so I left her place. We were like best friends and she was never untrustworthy at all. Her man went to jail too so we were helping each other out. She was basically getting me well and fronting me until my boyfriend got out. He only had to serve 2 weeks at that point. So she didn’t mind helping me. The falling out between us is another story tho. 

After I left her house I was in my car. It was raining and cold. I had just gotten caught shoplifting trying to make some money twice that week so I said fuck that I’m not trying to get arrested. I got lucky actually and the cops never came when I was caught both times. I was just down and depressed. Boyfriends in jail. I wake up the next morning sick af. Dan calls me. Asks me to come to his hotel. I’m sick as a damn dog and I’m just like yesssss thank you junkie gods lol. I arrive and he just woke up so he smokes with me. Asks me to drive him to the store in the new whip he just bought. He didn’t have his license at the time. I asked why he called and he said he remembered I was all alone in my car and shit and it was cold out. Dan is one of those people who doesn’t like being alone. Most addicts don’t like being alone actually lol. Dan and I kick it most of the day. He tells me I can stay with him if I want. He had the hots for this bitch Lydia tho and I just had to leave for a lil bit  when she got there. I happily took that offer. Idk how I get so lucky on getting the chance to stay with my dealers but I do lol. 

I ended up staying with dan for pretty much idk 2 weeks. Now whoever has stayed reading this long ass story is probably thinking “oh this junky bitch probably slept with him for dope” 
Dan is one of the nicest dudes I’ve ever met. He never once tried to put the moves on me. Never even made a flirtatious comment towards me. Mind you we barely knew each other for longer than a month. I think he could tell I wasn’t a druggie whore and would never cheat on my man. Dan and I slept in the same bed even. Idk why he never got a room with two beds but I didn’t mind because he kept his space and as did I. Sometimes I wouldn’t be with him when he checked into a new hotel or new room. Dan is one of the most hot headed people I’ve ever met. It’s cause of the dope cause when we’ve picked him up from jail and shit he’s not like that at all. But I would give him space when he would get real bad. Sometimes I would go run errands or go and hustle some cash too so it’s not like I was annoying and was just a mooch not leaving his side. 

He’s also one of those people that is never wrong. Like he doesn’t admit to his faults whatsoever. Don’t even try arguing with him. He doesn’t listen to anybody but himself most of the time. He has to be the one to think of shit first to even consider something even if you’ve explained something to him already. I remember teaching him how to dab black and he loved it. Told him to only use titanium nails cause it works the best with tar and yadayada. We were staying at a hotel that shared a parking lot with a smoke shop. He comes back to the room and shows me his new dab rig he just bought. Most cheap dab rigs only come with those dinky quartz nails and I explained to him numerous times before to use a titanium one. That same day his quartz nail broke and he was cussing and went to the smoke shop to get a new one. This motherfucker comes back with a titanium nail and try’s explaining to me that titanium is the only way to go and the best of the best cause that’s what the guy at the smoke shop told him. Smh I was like “you don’t listen to anything I say” lol anytime someone came over to buy a sack he would tell them about the titanium nail revelation he had and they would roll their eyes and look at me smiling. That’s just a mild example of how dan is when it comes to listening. Although, he never flipped out on me like he did everyone else. I think there was 2 times we got into a small argument but it was mild. He told me once “I don’t mind keeping you around for a number of reasons. 1) you’re not a fucking idiot like most of the people I deal with and 2) you’re not a damn junky thieving ass bitch” lol keep in mind I’m not trying to brag. 

We had fun though. He would have me drive his Mercedes to take him to go reup a few hours away. He’d have me help him serve sacks. Scratch scratchers. I met some people I’m friends with still. I’m just happy he didn’t ruin things by being a dirtbag and pulling some kinda move on me. The first 2-3 nights I stayed with him I was worried I would wake up to him groping me or something like that. Majority of dealers would’ve loved me staying with them but I wouldn’t have if they tried anything lol. It’s not like I’m ugly or anything either I mean I consider myself a good looking 21 year old. I also made sure I wasn’t cock blocking him. He never got any pussy anyways cause he’s gross. This chick that he’s still dating now would come over when I stayed with Dan for those couple of weeks but they fought like crazy so he never got any. 

When my boyfriend got released I went to pick him up that morning. Dan had to move rooms when I was gone but he got a room with 2 beds. Told us to stay there for the night with him. Thought it was kinda weird he didn’t do that before my boyfriend got out but whatever. The night after that my boyfriend and I got a room at the same hotel and told Dan he could stay with us. He did. The next day we had to check out and Dan lost his scratchers. He loves his scratchers and always has a stack of them. He misplaced them once and found them. Then lost them right when we were all packing up but he didn’t notice he lost them again until we checked out. Dan called me like an hour we parted and was cussing at me saying we stole them. I told him “Motherfucker you know damn well I didn’t steal your scratchers. You took them in the bathroom before you showered and that’s the last time I saw you with them. I’ll call the hotel and ask housekeeping.” Called and housekeeping said they didn’t find them which I still think they lied to this day. That hotel has lied in the past about not finding some of our stuff and we didn’t take them so housekeeping must have. Dan is notorious for blaming people for taking his shit even when they didn’t. That’s the only time he’s ever accused us of taking anything tho. He knows he’s wrong deep down but won’t admit it. I found out later by this chick Sam I met when staying with Dan that he would test me behind my back. Sam is also really close with Dan and he told her he would set up stuff up a certain way on purpose to see if I would steal. He always had a big silicone container that would hold an ounce of black in it and he would leave it out and put a small piece of paper in between the lid and container. If I opened it the paper would fall but I wouldn’t notice it. I never knew he did that cause I never once even thought about taking from him. 

Idk why I posted this long ass story really lol. A lot of us chicks have it a little harder cause dealers can be scummy. Dan was a rare guy and I appreciated him for that. We’re still friends. He’s in a program now. Some bitch set him up last year. My boyfriend almost knocked him out a few times cause of Dans mouth but anyone who knows Dan has had a similar experience with him lol. Another moral to my story is, if you’re not a thief and a cool person, and can build a friendship with dealers, they’ll help you out in times of need. Every time my man has gotten locked up I pretty much get taken care of. I don’t live in an open air market though. I’m sure it’s different around those areas. Also get tired of reading the same dumb shit in this sub. I don’t have hella stories to tell but figured I’d try lol",1522303254.0

She says it's like pins and needles X 100 and burns. It starts in her head and spreads through her whole body and concentrates in her head, hands and feet especially. She's a tough chick and she says it's so bad she can barely stand to do a shot so I know it's really painful. She doesn't do coke either. Just hair-on. I sometimes get a burning feeling in my arm further up from my injection site but figured it was from the coke and my veins being trashed. I'm guessing her issue is some kind of allergic reaction caused by the cut. That's just my best guess though. I've told her and her bf about this sub and how wonderful you all are and that this would be the best place to get answers. Tyvm in advance.

Back in the day she would ask me if I knew anyone who had perc 5s or shit to help her out - fast forward a couple years and I have been introduced to roxy 30s and i fucking love them. Same old shit as everyone else - tried them, like them, found someone who always had them, started buying small maybe like 2 a week, than 4 - than 8 and you know how it goes before you know it you're spending all your money on it. my mom and I have a tight bond - she always told me i could come and tell her anything, so when I told her that I was able to get these, she wanted some as well obviously. So we started putting money together to buy them. The habit was pretty bad about 2 years ago for an entire year - i was spending nearly every extra dollar I had on roxys. from about August 2017 to march 2018 I used, but not nearly as much - I sort of went back to chipping again.

Okay so long story short - I moved and my mother (who i assumed was a lil fucked up on xans) asks to use my car. says shes sober yada yada ya and just tired from not sleeping. 2 hours later I get a call saying she crashed my car. I was pissed. My family is aware that my mom has somewhat of a drug problem, but is in the complete dark about me. that day my mom crashed my car, she gave me $400 and was begging me to pick up some for her. I took the money but told her I wanted to stop doing them and that I wasnt going to buy them. So the next day I go to get my window fixed and just feel bad that my dad has to deal with this bullshit. my mom fucking up, wasting his money ect. i see the bill for the window replacement and its $400ish. what a ko-winky-dink. After waiting for it to get done and everything I contemplated hard, but figured my dad needed to know the truth. 

So, I went home and spoke to him in private and told him EVERYTHING and gave him the $400 my mom gave me. 

He was...understanding I guess. I told him that I wanted to get away from them (one of the reasons I moved out) and just stop using all together. He was obviously more mad at my mother for keeping such serious secrets from him yanno. He asked if I had a problem and needed help. I told him I really dont think I do have a problem, but than again I feel like every addict says that yanno. all he really said was to just call him if i ever get the urge to use or whatever.

Anyway - fast forward a couple months - i havent used anything in roughly 2 months. 

Just sucks because like I'm not ""craving it"" but thinking about it ugh, sorta makes me miss it

It honestly pisses me off how ineffective and expensive most rehabs are. 

For me they banned any prescription psychiatric drugs. No benzos for people with anxiety and no Ritalin for people with ADHD, but also no mood stabilizers or antipsychotics or even antidepressants either. So these geniuses thought that drug withdrawal was the perfect time to stop taking prescription psych meds.

They stuffed way too many people into one house. Five people sleeping in one bedroom. House has like 16 people living there and only two bathrooms. Thankfully when I came in I was the only one going through the peak of dope sickness, but crowding multiple dopesick people into 5 person bedrooms and having only 2 bathrooms sounds like a recipe for disaster (and lots of people pooping their pants or on the floor). 

They demonized weed like it was in the same class as heroin. One counselor tried to tell us that a kid jumped off a bridge because he smoked some weed and thought he could fly. If you smoked weed it was considered relapsing and the reaction was just like you shot a rig of dope. 

One especially stupid counselor did not even know what Immodium was. She did not even know it was OTC. Also when some Christianity talk came up and someone mentioned the Holy Ghost she literally thought it was a ghost like Casper or something.

Also the 12 steps and AA were always right and unquestionable. That shit was like a cult to them it was creepy as fuck.

Just spreading the information around since WDs are like fucking medieval torture. 

Some other tips Ive learned from experience.

DO NOT TAKE FUCKING BENADRYL OR ANY OTHER ANTIHISTAMINE TO TRY TO SLEEP. They make RLS sooooo much worse. The idiots at rehab gave us the max adult dosage of Benadryl before bed and I would always just be flopping around all night, even if my RLS wasn't that bad during the day. I didn't make the connection and just until I got home and slept just fine because I didn't have any Benadryl. 

Immodium is a great tool but DO NOT SUPERDOSE. There have been reports of people getting heart damage because they took like 10 times the recommended dose. I don't know what the safest highest amount you can take. I take around 20mg only if I know Im going to be super sick: no negative effects yet but it still.scares me to take that much.

1. Take H. Dissolve into a decent amount of water. Not TOO much but not as little as possible. Less water makes it harder to powderize. Ideally, after H has been dissolved, water should be gold to orange-gold. 


2. Get some foil. Warp foil to make it flat-ish in the middle and flip up the sides so that the liquid will stay in the middle and not go everywhere. The more H you used, the bigger the middle area needs to be but overall the more the liquid can spread out the better.

3. Take monkey water solution (the H water you just made) and drip it on foil.

4. Now this is where you can be creative. CAREFULLY apply a low source of heat to bottom of foil. I personally used a scented wax diffuser with the wax bowl taken off, essentially just a hot light bulb chamber with a nice place on top to rest my foil and goods. I've also used a stove on low heat, a candle, and no heat at all, just lots of patience.

5. Do not use high heat, honestly the longer the better. You don't want to toast your nom-noms.

6. After water has evaporated you should be left with a pool of reduced, hardened H. If you lightly poke it with something pointy it should produce a nice tap and bounce right off. If its not dry enough then it will stick to what you poked it with making a snapping kind of sound and you will have to pull back your pointy object a little. You want no stick, like you were poking hardened plastic.

7. Lastly, get a baggie that will fit most if not all of the foil inside. Take a knife or something you can scrape with and gently start poking and scraping away at the H. OR do whatever you can think of to separate the H from the foil, I dont care.




Now you should have a baggie full of feel good. simply crush everything inside up and you have BTH snortable powder without any added powder cut    :)


If you cant get some stuff off the foil then just add a touch of water and reclaim it as monkey water.

If some stuff isnt crushable or sticks to the bag then its not dry enough or too concentrated.

Lastly, I find that a little bit of the stuff usually goes a long, long way. So go slow, you can always take more later but you cant untake it, you know?",1522284151.0

He stopped getting the green's, I guess his medicaid will only pay for these generic ones. Whatever, they work but Id much rather have the greens.

It's a normal day in that I wake up, slightly sick but bearable, and do a combination of getting ready for work while texting my dboy what time I will take lunch today (I'm the IT department manager so as long as shits not hitting the fan or if the CEO happens to notice I can pretty much take lunch whenever and as long as I want).  So I say 10am and I'll be there for 1030 (half hour drive to his small City).

10am comes and we confirm and Bam I'm like a rocket on the highway.  He hits me with the ""I talked to him this morning, he's not answering but he will by time u get here"".  Instant anxiety attack. Keep my cool and eventually get to his house and find out he's still not answering.  I'm now freaking out with 250 in my hand and just praying to hear his phone vibrate as we sit in his car .  Sheer agony for 45 minutes.  No answers, no backups around, WDs setting in, and I know if I head back to my small city I won't be able to get back up there until tomorrow (Damn girlfriend's a hawk).

So in my desperation (I live a few hours from Philly, some small city's but not somewhere easy to cold cop like the big city's) I decide to drive around the shittier areas and pray we somehow make magic happen. 

Random black dude walking down the street, I'm like fuck it so we slow down and I behin. ""Yo man what's up"". ""yo"". ""Looking for H you good?"".  ""Nah man"".  Now this was discouraging as not only was it a failure but the scumiest dude I've seen on the streets we've been prowling just looked at me like I'm scum..ouch.

After 2 more similiar attempts down, I'm at that point where realization sinks in along with the depression and other FML feelings associated with it. Dboy says he's gonna drive me back to my car, fuck....

On the way we pass the projects and I'm like ""Turn in lets try one last time"".  Dboy don't work and I'm on break 2 hours now so fuck it why not. Sit in the lot for 15 mins or so and nothing. I see a black guy come out and smoke a cig . Fuck it what's the worst that can happen. ""Yo man what's good"". ""nothing man you looking for someone?"". ""Yea his name is H and I can't find him and I'm sick as fuck"".  ""Bro come in"".  Ok so at this point I have a huge fucking rush of euphoria at the possibility I will score my first cold cop, disregarding I'm about to walk into this dudes apartment with 250$ , but I didn't care at this point. I walk in and he has 2 fat chicks on the couch watching TV which for some reason make me feel a bit safer. He asks who's driving me I say it's my boy were looking and the situation. He asks if I'm a cop I say no but he continues to treat me as one, so I say bro listen I'm not fucking around I'll crush up some Xanax and do it off your floor, I'm just looking to get right and if you got it we can connect. 

He just says yea do that man.  So I'm a little confused but I'm like fuck it, I pull out my phone, crush 2 .5 xans and start railing away, as he starts walking into the kitchen they are gone. 

He asks how much dough I got, which I didn't want to tell the truth so I say 50 bucks. Now 50$ would typically get me like 6-7 stamps as bunnys go for 70-90.  He hands me a bun and I give him the 50 just like that.  

I go to my dboys car (who no longer is a dboy at this point hah) and I snort 2 bags and give my dboy 2 for driving around with me and shit.  Holy shit it's 10x better than I'm used to.  We both are listening to music driving around and are in the craziest state of bliss from a combo of the dope but also how we both thought we weren't getting shit. 

He drops me off and I pull away in my car and go RIGHT BACK to the dude's house and knock. He answers and I just smile and say ""I got more if u do"".  Bam 200$ and I get a house (Brick turned to brick House turned to house hah) AND score his number. 

Fast forward and my dboy is now calling me for his shit so I got a habit and someone who let's me get free shit like 5 days a week.

Thank God I said fuck it turn into them projects.

Usually 20mg IR(snorted), my problem is that my 2 last times that I took them 20 mg didn't make me feel high at all and Idk what happened: I mean, I took them for 3 years 1 times every 10 days and 20mg always made me feel great but the last 2 times they didn't work also if nothing has changed from the other times that it worked.
For try to chase the high both this times i tried to take more, around 1 month ago I took 40 mg and I still didn't had feel anything, 10 days after I took 80 mg(40mg swallowed+40 snorted at the same time) and I still didn't had feel any high. After these 2 disappointed nights I decided to stop for a while for see if I have ""lost the magic"" forever or no. 
I know that if u use them too much u will get some tolerance but I don't understand why I didn't get any tolerance in 3 years but now whitout using more mg or more often then every other times I got it. And sadly also 4x my usual dose didn't make me feel any high. I'm sad, anyways today are 22 days that I don't use it or any opiates, my tolerance should be again at the normal level when 20mg made me pretty high (not nodding, just feeling good) or is that feel lost forever?

Up until then I was just a pot head who drank some cheap booze at weekend parties and took some addies when I found them because they made video games amazing. 

Fast forward to when I was 18 and I started my career which was handed to me on a silver platter from my father. 

I started off on the shop floor at one of the home base operations around Austin. I was still using at a pretty recreational level at this point. 

When I turned 20 I got an opportunity for a road crew that went all over the world installing , fixing , and maintaining the machinery .. now this was a huge pay increase and god damn all that money coming to a 20 year old kid whose only bill was a payment on a brand new truck who loved to party was bad news. 

I got real heavy into the shit real shortly after that .. popping a lot of pills and snorting a lot of boy. 

I have always fucked around with other stuff .. I really love stimulants ... Molly .. drinking sometimes.  

But for me the opiates were the one drug where I could find that sweet spot where it literally made every part of my life more enjoyable .. work , video games , sex .. I mean everything. I was able to figure out what dose worked best for whatever situation I was put in. 

I feel like it's the one drug I could really fit into my life 24 hours a day .. I could just never figure out how to do that with anything else .. or never really wanted to anyways I guess. 

I went through withdrawals after I took my station here in the Midwest and don't have any connects for anything stable. 

So now I'm just chipping .. I doubt I'll ever be 100% clean because well I fucking love drugs.

In the past things went well, but t was always risky. On two occasions Cliff sent the middleman to the ATM with my Card. On one occasion I realized I had work at the same time as re-p for dope and I cursed a storm..  was like ""ahh fuck."" At that time a few months ago Cliff was like, ""why you cursin, it'll be fine. You tell me what to take out and I'll withdraw the exact amount you tell me."" Despite experience to the contrary where he claimed to hear the automated system quote a higher balance than what was true. He probably went with the higher number that rhymed just so I'd approve a larger order. When I realized the error he said ""we can't shrink the order now it's too late"" which is BS because if you get in the car with a dboy and you have $70 less than expected, they're not gonna leave and say ""oh sorry you can't buy any portion of the original order.""


&nbsp;

Point is, handing a debit card to a junky is rife with risk despite their promises.


In the most recent instance, he knew I wanted out yet he begged because he knew it was my pay day like clockwork. In the end the very scenario that I was promised wouldn't happen, happened. It's really more of a miracle it didn't happen sooner and that there was only one incident of suspected deception. 


This being aside from those two occasions where the middle was entrusted with my card. Nothing went wrong on those two occasions but I'm sure I said prior on at least one of those occasions that I'd prefer if he didn't have the middle take my card to the ATM. To get my approval I'm sure Cliff said whatever I wanted to hear, ""don't worry I'm going to the ATM my self"" then the plans changed once he had my card and circumstances developed.


&nbsp;

Now, your feature presentation:

#Good news, 

I got what was owed to me on the day promised. Despite early promises that I would easily be able to get mostly cash, I shifted gears and stressed that I'll take any form of payment that is immediately available. If Cliff wants to give me cash, he can sell his pills and give me an opportunity to trade pills for cash but I'm not going to have him short me 5 pills, wait for him to sell them and then have no pills or cash days later.


So yeah, he did right by me but last week he did take $100 more out of the ATM than what I authorized and lied about it when I asked. Then as I investigated he shifted the blame towards his middle.

&nbsp;


Well, do I have a treat for y'all. I started to type up a transcript of a phone conversation that I recorded (and shall be erased after transcribing) with Cliff from last week. The topic of the call was my missing $100. Part of the call incldes me looking up bank records, Cliff suggesting that I check the store sureveillance tape and me arguing further that I shouldn't have to do that nor is it even possible.

Cliff argued it is possible for me to go to the store and ask to see the surveillance footage that would corroborate his story but realisitically, the store would only do this if I had submitted a police report and even then it would probably be the cops who get to see the tape --- if they even cared to review it. Perhaps if I had a lawyer they could put pressure on the store to get surveillance footage, maybe if i sent someone in a suit pretending to a be a lawyer... Anyway way too complex.

&nbsp;

During the phone conversation Cliff suggested answers and options. As a result, at least couple of times I said ""this is way too fucking complex, I just want my money.""


Like I said, I have a real treat lined up for you all. I just gotta finish transcribing the convo, then I gotta decide what (if anything) should be omited and then the format.

&nbsp;


Regarding the format of a story which contains a phone conversation. Does anyone have any suggestions? Like maybe it ould be typed up to resemble a chat room convo. Where it has..

> Sloan: What I said.

> Cliff: What he said in response.

_________


Alternatively, I could use this format....

> Sloan: ""What I said.""

> Cliff: ""What he said in response.""


The problem with this format is that I would have quotes nested within quotes for the parts of the conversation where Cliff quotes Derrick, his middleman.


_________


Then, my third and last alternative for formatting a transcribed and quote phone conversation would be to use the same format that is used in many novels. Such as...


> I called Cliff on the phone upon realizing that $100 was taken out in addition to the agreed amount. Cliff lied and said, ""I have no idea."" To which I responded, ""that's bullshit, you were the last person to use my card and nobody else cold've done it unless they knew my PIN and hd the card. I went on to ask, ""did you send Derrick to the ATM with my card like you've done in the past?"" 

> Cliff confirmed, ""I did not give Derrick your card.. but but [stutter] he was next to me and I went outside to take a phone call."" Cliff went on, ""Derrick said 'I thougt you wanted three like last time', and I said no, no, no, you gotta make this right.""


&nbsp;

So the first paragraph in this third and final example contains me quoting Cliff as he quotes Derrick. It gets complicated but I would reference an MLA writing manual and pages from fictitious novels before finalizing and submitting a post in such a format.


The point is, I can quote the conversation like a movie script, or chat room/instant messenger chat log. This ""chat log"" format can be done one of two ways as already mentioned.

Then the third option is to write about the conversation in a more ""natural"" way like it would be done in a novel.

&nbsp;


**TL;DR:** Cliff's script day went well and I was made whole. Nonetheless, I learned my lesson and if he comes to ask me to borrow money for dope on my next pay day, my answer will most certainly be a resounding ""no"". If he begs and annoys me and says ""I nver say no to you"" I will remind him of what happened last week. 

What happened last week? I granted his request with the stipulation that he is not to withdraw more than $200. Then he lied and denied it until it was impossible and proceeded to blame the middle. I plan to post a story or transcript/story based directly on a directly related phone call very soon


So aside from saying this week was a success and providing a preview; the goal of this post is to seek recommendations.


I seek recommendations for how I should format a story which consists 90% of quotes from a two person phone converstion with Cliff quoting a third person in order to support his accounting of events.

It worked great for the pain and overall health for about 6 months, then I started getting sick shortly after it wore off. At most I'd take 2 a day, so pretty far from addiction levels. Anyway it got to the point where if I took even 1/2 a vicodin, I wouldn't feel any sort of pain relief but about 8 hours later I'd be sick for the next 24 hours vomiting. It only stopped after I vomited thick bile. Also a few weeks before the vomiting started, my stomach was sensitive to a lot of foods (pepsi, anything spicy, coffee). My stomach still has problems with these foods and it all started a few months after taking hydro. A few months ago they did an endoscopy and found I have gastritis, but the dr didn't think it had anything to do with the hydro. Does hydrocodone make my liver generate more bile?

Also had gallbladder removal surgery a year ago, and they gave me perc after I told them hydrocodone made me vomit. I was able to take the perc fine for about 2 weeks, then the same vomit thing started. After 1 week without anything, I took a fragment (like a single grain of sand size) of hydrocodone I had leftover from the year before. About 12 hours later the puking started again and lasted almost 48 hours until I puked up bile again.

Does this sound more like an allergy to hydro? The only reason I don't think its an alergy is because it takes several hours for my body to react, and the amount is so small it can't be wd. Has anyone else had similar reactions?",1522252745.0

I got a hold of 10 hydro 5s and I have several oz of bali and maeng da Kratom. Just did my last shot of my 30 a few minutes ago and want it to be my last. My plan is to make it until tomorrow morning before I start with the hydros, and was thinking maybe taking half or 1 of the 5s and 4-6 g of Kratom every 6-8 hours to simply hold off the dope sickness as I can’t miss work. 

I plan to take 2 for the first day or two, and then 1, and taper down over the next 5 days combining with Kratom. Is this even a possible taper plan or does anyone have any better ideas or some success doing something similar? 

Any response will be appreciated and good luck and stay safe all my opiate brothers and sisters!

I'm looking for advice from long-term heavy H (ECP) users. I've been using opiates for about 4 years, H 2. My partner and I go through anywhere from 4-6g a day. On really bad days we will have 3 (1.5 each), and if we had funds for it, we could probably comfortably do about 5gs each without even catching a real nod. 

Our tolerance is high, and we haven't gone a single day in all these years where we haven't had SOMETHING. Even with all we use, we're sick MOST OF the time. Not 12-24 hrs in sickness, but just feel crappy. I'll do a healthy shot and start jonesing for another 30 mins later or less. 

Are there any other heavy users who can give me advice on tapering down our useage to something we can keep up with easier, and stop feeling so shitty all the time? I know the short term will be tough but I'm coming from a place of years of use. Even when we cut it down to like 1.5/day each and are somewhat good with self-control, it's like our bodies never adjust to the amount and we're sick forever. So we just start using more again.

ive never gone through the pain med thing --- i only did the benzo thing and went to emergencyrooms when i couldnt get percs or oxy or w.e. (10 years ago)

i am honestly going to shoot for one of these three: xstampza, a tamper proof hydromorphone, morphine ER, or oxycontin 10mg



i dont want to mention oxy though i want to get around mentioning oxy infact, i dont even like oxy as much as other opiates.



i am ABSOLUTELY FINE with something tamper proof. infact, extended release is preferable. i am in considerable pain that is still progressively getting worse.


PS: I have a stash of Dihydrocodeine and Codeine,so getting anything at all would be fine tbh. but by the off chance that i am able to get a doctor to prescribe me a pain medicine for my extreme chronic pain, will they do an equianalgesic doseage for me?

Also I'm making this because I can't really share all the details with most of my friends and also I don't want to annoy them by rambling about how great my girlfriend is. So anyways here's the rest of the post


So me and my girl have been going steady for about 4 months now, and before that we both had the biggest crushes on each other... like middle school level shit. My girlfriend likes to smoke weed and drink a bit, and she's going to try psychedelics this summer since she's never done them but wants to with me. Her mother struggled with drug addiction for many years, and they damage it did to her body is what eventually caused her to die when my girl was a young teen. So she's not cool with any of the harder shit I do. I've told her some of the things I did, and when we started going out I told her I used to do dope. She didn't freak out on me and she wasn't disappointed, but she did say if I ever do them again she will leave me. So I became addicted to dope around Christmas time, before that I was chipping. Once things started to get a bit more serious I started tapering down to quit without having withdrawals. And it was actually going really well and I was sticking to my  taper regiment. But then one fateful night I was pulled over with weed and because of that I'm probably going to be on probation for a year at least, 2 maximum. So basically I figured that I might as well do as much dope as I can before I'm forced to quit because of probation. Now she doesn't know that and thinks I'm still clean. So I feel like a piece of shit for lying to her like that behind her back every time I use. But my sentencing date is right around the corner so I'll be done with it soon enough. 

But yeah so besides that one little detail that she doesn't know about everything is amazing. SO here's the part where I'm gonna ramble on about how amazing she is in every way possible. Since I've been with her my life has been a thousand times better. She is such a caring, sweet girl who always makes me feel better when I'm down, and she always has a positive outlook on life which has helped me tremendously. I'm typically a pretty neutral/depressed person so her positivity has done wonders for me. She's also the my beautiful woman I've ever met. At first when I met her I wasn't that into her looks, like I could see exactly why people would find her attractive, but she just wasn't my type. But over time that changed and I think her beauty is second to none. And she's also quick as a whip, she's creditably smart and shes going to school for astronomy. How cool is that? I think its pretty neat. But she's also really funny, she has the same sense of humor as me. She's got all the same insecurities I do, we both hate ourselves, but love each other, and there's just a whole bunch of little things we have in common too. It's honestly like I'm dating myself lol. 

And holy shit the sex is honestly the best I've had in my entire life. We both share a lot of the same kinks too. And dat pusssaayyy...holly shit its so tight and amazing. Really fuego top tier shit. Nice and tight, tastes great too. I could eat that summabitch for breakfast lunch and dinner. And her sex drive is crazy high too. Also, atleast for me, when I actually love someone it just makes the sex soooo much better, and I've never loved someone as much as I love her. I was never the type of dude that could just sleep with a bunch of women. I mean it's fun and all but I really like having that emotional connection with someone yanno? So yeah best I've ever had.

Honestly even though we've only been serious for about 5 months, I got a good feeling about her....I think she might actually be the one as cheesy as that sounds. Obviously I'm gonna wait a lot longer before I'm absolutely sure of it. But it's not like any other love, this one is different because its us. I just love her soo very much. Like I've never felt this way with any other girl I've been with. The one thing that's really getting to me is my dope habit which I'm happily going to kick very soon. I've always quit hard shit any time I've been with a girl except this one time and its starting to get to me.

So yeah thats that I could go on for way longeer about how much I love her but y'all get the idea. I just wanted to make this post because I'm in a really good mood and just wanted to share this with someone, but I don't really got anyone to share it with...so y'all mfers are the next best thing. Man I really love her sooo much.",1522390644.0

Anyways i lay down and try to get my nod on, i notice after 20 mins that I’m pretty sedated but wide awake. This is normal for new oxycodone users apparently. It took about 40+minutes to fall asleep, but a few minutes before that i notice i had extreme mental clarity in the sense that i could visualise people doing and saying things very vividly.

After falling asleep i entered a state of extremely vivid multi dream reality. My first dream involved millions of green insects that are poisonous and bite. upon hearing my fathers voice outside my own house i go outside and am instantly attacked by these poisonous insects. I end up dead in less than a minute, saw my own body dead on the front door step from a third person perspective. Then my dream sort of like 10x rewinded (I call this a dream reset) and I’m in a new dream reality.

This time Im being sprayed in the face with fly spray by my mother. I was punching her to fuck her off but she tackled me, held me down and sprayed fly spray into my face until i died. Once again third person out of body perspective upon dying. Dream resets and I’m in my own house with my friend who i do drugs with often.

Both my friend and i are aware that we are in some drug induced dream reality but we don’t know what drugs we took. We have a genuine sense of fear and adrenaline pumping through us as we try to open my front door which seems to be glued shut as is all the doors. “Fuck i don’t wanna die again dude” “Yeah me neither the fuck even is this” We go into my room, break my window and i jump out. As my friend goes to jump out the dream “resets” again.

It seems I’m at the “starting menu” of this game. I hear a voice of a dark entity say “welcome”. All i see is pitch black all around with subtitles of what the entity is saying to me. It is explaining to me that this is where you go when you fall asleep on a select few drugs. Which included a small list of drugs such as DXM, MDMA and various other psychedelics and RC’s. I am told my only objective is to not die, and that no actual physical damage is being done to real body. Dream resets…

Now I’m in this counter strike cross with prop hunt game. All i can do is stab, i have a heavy duty military knife, and im in my own house which is dimly lit. I hear some sounds from the hallway, i shout “where are you motherfucker”. Then this carrot comes racing at me and “tackles” me down and is inflicting pain somehow. I stab it, i think its dead. Dream resets “fuck man when does this shit end, this is fucking torture”

So now I’m in my dimly lit house, still unknown what drug is responsible for this vivid, borderline, nightmare. I walk into my bathroom to look in the mirror to check my eyes, maybe that will give me a hint as to what I’m on. As i approach the mirror, i see my own face for a split second and my vision gets extremely distorted and swirly, then a dark entity sneaks up behind me and kills me.

“The fuck i didn’t even get a chance”

The entity replies with something like “i do what i want, your trapped here until the drugs where off “fuuuckk”

I wake up, I’m pretty sweaty, its 5:30am still have an hour left so i try to go back and give this bitch entity a piece of my mind, didn’t work. But holy fuck this was INTENSE.

It was extremely vivid and I’m dead sure i felt pain and all my other natural emotions. Crazy shit. 8/10 overall.

Is this type of next level shit normal? Has anyone had some fucked up dreams like this, if so what drugs were involved?

TLDR: Had extremely vivid “dream trip” through multiple dream alternations of reality which my one goal was to not die. Involved friends, family and a dickhead entity that was in some kind of control of my opiate fuelled dream state.",1522382808.0
887m5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/887m5p/update/,12,https://redd.it/887m5p,ricketycricket96,Update,"So I'm home now. Learned something new. My sister ran through her script of percs she got from her surgery. My mom checked in on her and says ""oh, you ran out of Percocet? I'll get your refill tomorrow, in the mean time you can take some from my stash"". Now I'm sitting on the couch having a beer as she says this, and the moment she said ""my stash"" my mind immediately told me ""don't worry, there is oxy in this house"". Which was weird, because I hadn't thought about it all day, even as I saw my sister's script dwindling away as time passed me by. The fact that there will be more oxy here tomorrow comforts me further, but at the same time I can't sleep, the anticipation of digging into those bottles is nightmarish. Knowing that tomorrow, before my other sibling gets home, after my mom goes to the gym and after my father goes to work, and after my sister takes her Percocet, I will fiendishly dig through every cabinet in this house for fucking Percocet, its both comforting and unnerving. It's a damn shame really, after being clean for so long and relapsing recently with morphine, I fucking hate myself. But here I am awake, waiting. Waiting for another release. And it won't be my last, that much I know for sure. I guess I just want to say that I'm sorry. I've been an asshole, and karma has come to bite back.

I genuinely can't understand how no one else in my family sees a problem. When this bullshit began and she claimed my painkillers for herself because she was afraid I would kill myself (bullshit), i was under the impression she hadn't had painkillers prescribed to her in years, because she told me as much. She had gotten 3 full 30 day scripts for tramadol, hydro, and oxy. And she just recently came up with this delusional and clearly fake story about how she got prescribed codiene and she hid it thinking I would steal it and she hid it so hard she can't find it. She hasn't been prescribed codiene in years, but she was prescribed oxy a week before she started talking about this mysterious bottle of codiene. I don't even get why she had to lie about the drug name, she clearly gobbled the bottle quickly and had to lie to herself and me just to feel okay about it. This is just fucking sad. My advice to you parents is don't fucking steal drugs from your kids and don't let them see you so far in denial you can't fucking see straight.     
      
I'm leaving this place as soon as I have money saved, (let's not even get into the fact that she wanted my entire paycheck), but it's absolutely insane to me that she completely destroyed her relationship with me for a few bottles of morphine, a box of fentanyl, and a handful of oxy. She's still sitting on most of them, and she knows if she would just get rid of them I would let go of so much of this anger. Just fucking die or get help already, I can't watch this anymore.

I was a hardcore herion addict in my early 20s (30s now). Lost everything - family kicked me out, became a prostitute, lived with low-lives - everyone I knew was a felon. AND THEN. My main dealer went to prison and somehow I got clean. I went on to finish my Bachelors blah blah blah.


So here I am, with an amazing job making $90k/yr. in a nice area drinking from time to time but hadn't once considered going back. I have a horrible ""picker"" and tend to not go for the right guys. 


Some guy hurt my feelings and I started getting bars from his dealer to deal. Then norcos. Then percs. I was lonely AF and started fucking the married strung out dealer I was getting my shit from. On to opium with him. He felt bad about cheating on his wife, so he insisted on not kissing me. I talk to this guy every day and see him a few times a week. Have feelings for him. The no kissing and reiterating he has no feelings for me makes me feel worse. The last time I talked to him he told me he didn't consider me a friend then went on to detox on his own. He hit me up last Thursday looking for shit and I guess OD'ed badly that night. He's in rehab indefinitely ... I only know from a third party. I miss him so much IDK what is wrong with me.


I've been getting norcos and percs from his friend/another dealer. Got high and came onto him. He has a gf and will not cheat. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm a good person. I'm up at 5:00 am to do crossfit for 1.5 hours every day. Then I work 9-10 hours. I have great friends and a family that cares about me. I'm a good looking girl. Right now, I'm high alone after work and feel like complete shit. I feel like the higher I get the more lonely I feel. I have 3 norcos left until I re-up on percs on Monday or Tuesday. I don't think I should be doing drugs. I just don't think I care enough to stop.

Check this shit out.. so I met a plug several months ago from a subreddit that isn't around anymore. Things have went well until the last month or so.. now he's over charging me, slacking my bags, and generally gets pissy when I hit him up.. like he don't wanna help or something. He's literally my only source in my new city, which is one of the bigger cities in the dirty south. I cold copped off of a Google group, but it was .5 slack and pretty bad dope.

Now I'm at the point I'm so fed up with this fucker, I'd rather quit than keep fucking with him.

So she’s like 20 mins away, I’ve gotta ditch like $130 of the new shit over the fence of some storage unit so she doesn’t find it.  I don’t remember honestly a lot of what happened on the way home but she wanted me to take a drug test so she made me go in and buy one on the way home. I’m in line about to buy it and I open my wallet and I lost my debit card at some point during the day.. lmfao. So I gotta go back out there and explain this to her, meanwhile she is fuming.

Turns out, I drive right by his crib pretty much when I go home to visit my parents.

A few weeks ago, I was heading down to visit them and my brother and I decided we wanted to try the dope where this fellow, let's call him Gollum, is at. So I shoot him a text, let him know what the deal is, and that I'd be picking him
up to go to the spot at whatever time.

So the time comes and I go scoop Gollum and he's acting super fucking weird. fidgeting in my seat and asking me over and over how many bags I want and yada yada. Gollum says we're going to his main go to go guy.  I have to give him 3 for his services, no worries I'm used to that shit. I tell him 15, for the 46th time, and he suggests that we buy 6 and then do them right then and then buy the other 9. I tell him nah, if this is his fault dude we should be  straight. it's an open air market so id rather get the fuck out of there. 

We get there after him giving me the wrong directions 90 times, and i drop Gollum off and I make a block. I see him hang ole dude the money and get handed something back, and then they go inside a building together and come out a few minutes later. Gollum comes back to my car and is telling me to go go go. he counts the bags out, and there's two different kinds. 6 (the same number he suggested we buy and do right away) are Nike stamps. The other 9 are plain bags. Something is fishy. he counts out his 3 (and drops one back into the pile) out of the Nike bags and gives the rest, 12 (3 Nike 9 plain) to me. A few minutes later he realizes that he only has two and asks me to count mine and see if I have 13, which I do, and he grabs his third, making sure it's a Nike bag. On the way back he shoots two bags and keeps telling me how he doesn't want any problems with me and is being super sketchy and rocking back and forth and kind of has like a childish temper tantrum when he can't register. He legit almost cried I think. When we stop for gas, I dump a plain bag on a foil and go to smoke it. stuff melts down like meth, but isn't meth. I call him out about and he says he doesn't know, they're real and i'm tripping.

Gollum then makes me drop him off at an overpass (on top of it), not close to where we met up. Maybe it was close, idk,the city i was in is huge and I don't know it too well. So I get home and my brother and I get to doing what we do. I do a nike bag, and i'm ripped. totally Fent, and i kind of knew it going in. He does a plain bag, nothing. does 2 more. Nothing. Shit sticks to the bag like wet flour. Nike bags didn't stick at all. He does a Nike bag, he's floored as well.

Gollum texts me a few times asking me about the bags and what I felt about them. I tell him they're fake and what not. He texts me again the other day saying ""I forgot to ask you, how were those bags?""

My question to y'all is:

Did the dboy rip US off and it was a coincidence that he grabbed all 3 Nike bags?

Did him and the dboy work together to rip ME off?

Did he rip me off alone, pocket the money, only buy 6 and had the flour (or whatever) bags on him already?

i'm torn between option B and C.

I was addicted to opiates for three years straight which I kicked cold turkey back in 2012 when I was in Lebanon.  Since then I occasionally get high but it is a rarity and my use is self enforcing as my friends will not provide me with anything for two days in a row.

Now for my question, can opiate addiction cause a person to develop an extreme panic disorder later in life?

I am a retired drug trafficker of some internet fame, and for many years I lived a very dangerous and very wild life.  Two years ago after being shot in the shoulder over 23,000$ I ceased my activities. During the time I was a trafficker I never suffered panic attacks or anxiety.

Over the past two months I have suffered all symptoms of a heart attack.  I visited a regular doctor and was given an ekg and they said it was a panic attack. I was refused any medication because my ursine screen showed thc. (I told the doctor I’m a smoker of cannabis prior anyway)

A few days ago I was sitting in my recliner after work and very relaxed when I suffered an attack so bad I passed out from it.  I went to the ER and blood work was taken as well as another EKG.  My blood pressure was low but my heart rate was sustained at 125 beats per minute for over an hour.  They administered 1 mg of lorazepam IV, after several minutes I felt fine.  I left with a script for 15 .25 mg Xanax and was told to see a psychiatrist.  The pills are not effective unless I take two of them which is .5 mg.

So my questions are essentially did my former opiate addiction cause me to develop a random panic disorder later in life? Additionally, all of my attacks have occurred when I am not worried or depressed, how is it possible to just have a random panic attack at any moment?  Also I’d like my dosage to be changed to .5 mg as .25 is just not effective, how should I ask the psychiatrist this without being treated like a piece of shit?

Thank you all In advance",1522356330.0

So many years ago i had gotten out of rehab and had nowhere to go, moved with my partna to usa but that didnt work, so it was off to usa to live with my best friend who had been forced to move to usa where his uncle had a carpet business after his 3rd dui. We were both only 21 and 22 at the time he had been racking them up since HS. Luckily he had already been in durham for 6 or 8 months, ""clean"", and just got a nice new 1br apartment after having lived with his strict ass uncle since he got there. I hadnt seen him in months...wasnt sure what to expect. (For reference lets call my boy W.)

Welp i walk in the door after catching a greyhound from usa to usa and its a reunion. Hes got like 4 norcos on the counter (5s) and maybe a blue football or two but the second i laid eyes on him i knew. Motherfucker has been doing good and has started to get his shit together but has the itch to go hard bad. Once we split the hydros (that was my test since i was pretty fresh out of rehab - long term Scientology rehab) he broke out the dope. I was ecstatic. Unfortunately he followed with ""i think this shits fake. I got it from a hooker out of the yellow pages but it doesnt get me high."" I do a shot its bunk. I said youve been here how many months and don't have a connect? I was always the resourceful part of the team. We were best friends since 9th grade (him a year ahead of me at a diff school). Sniffed our first bag together my senior year. Shot up together a year later. Crashed and burned. I started to understand why he wanted me to move to usa so bad...he knew id sniff out some dope. And i did before long. I also made a bunch of local junkie acquaintances thru bluelight topix and opiophile and before long we was strung out again.

Someone had got us some bags from usa that were bomb...and i got the dudes number who sold it. Honestly we were gonna rob the guy and he sensed it and would not meet me even tho i called every day for two weeks. We had a local plug who was cool...hood ass usa dude always with his sidekick poo or his gf (who i still talk to 7 or 8 yrs later. This was when mephedrone hit scene we got big into IV 4mmc i have some stories from that)...but this other guys dope was a 10/10 plus it was gonna be free so finally he agreed to meet me. But he was sending a runner. Some chick. Even better i thought but he wouldnt send her with anymore than like 8 20 bags.

My boy W had a big white van from his carpet job and we drove to the meet spot at walmart and honestly we had the tools and were gonna kidnap this chick. She calls as we pull up and throws a curveball wanting me to go inside the store with her and buy cigs since she had no ID. I hop out and she is waiting under the flag pole front like she said...i guess my dumbass fell in love. Didnt rob her. Sweet talked her out the dope she brought (turns out the d boy was her ex) and set up a date for the next night.

A bonnie and clyde situation ensued.

Little info on the woman.

She was honestly my first out of high school supposed to be ""adult"" relationship. Total whore. Anal on the table the first time we hung out girl. Attractive in a slutty way. Full probably $4k back piece tattoo buddhist related for no reason...lots more ink...in tattoo mags at one point. Super bisexual. My slam piece. It all came at a price tho i would find out.

I started to sell tar in a mainly ECP area after making a 7 hour round trip to pick up and bring back. They ate it up man and since i was new to the area she put me on this whoooooole group of people and i blew up. She also introduced me to her mexi plug so really top to bottom she put me on.

I got 14 dime singles of tar for 100 brought back to where i stayed i could sell each balloon for 25 really all the way up if i wanted. Raised my startup capital by robbing her ex who was a dealer for 80 balloons one night while he OD'ed. They claimed to be besties but she basically robbed this guy blind every single chance we got (we hung out alot) and even told him right after when we bout ran a train on his current girlfriend (Cs mom walked in thinking we were shooting up. No your daughter is munchin cat i got my dick in her mouth. Beautiful girl. Dead now). She told dude and i happened to be there in his room and he threw about 7g of tar on a cooking spoon and tried to do a mega shot and die. His new only few weeks in GF cheated on him with his whore ex whose supposedly his best friend and satan (me). He did fall out i took all of the dope and cash hit him with 8mg of subs and when he was lucid i dipped. He got over it and they stayed together until she passed. Edit: so i was always mad i didnt get to fuck that girl. I even let it slip to C that i was mad her mom ruined that and a HUGE fight ensued bc apparently she can initiate 3somes i just cant want it to happen or remember it fondly. Yes typical immature jealousy bs. Anyways. A couple years fast forward (as all you will find it ended i moved) C and the chick would come down to where i moved to and we had this amateur night strip club hustle where they would enter amateur night, id make it rain some singles hype em up to win like i didnt know em. Theyd pick up my drizzle money plus my enthusiasm usually made C win the other chick usually got 3rd which was 20-50 i think ANYWAYS thats not the point the point is i smashed and it was awesome sauce. She did wanna know if she gave better dome than C since they both dated the same guys and yeah C loses that one.

Ok hold on. I know i sound like a POS. And i was. But i didnt treat everyone like that. This was my current girls ten year ex BF and best friend. Constantly surrounded by him and his friends and these cats were mid to upper 20s emo band guys which is not my scene (idk what i am a hippie who wears polo. Really just a junkie). Every time they hugged and inside joked and did their thing jealous young buck me decided it was fair game to use and abuse the dude. I mean my chick orchestrated it. He was business competition as well. He was closer to the main clique but i could afford to pick up ten times what he did (same plug). I got sketched one week after mofos kept falling out in my nice ass house and enacted a strict NO SHOOTING policy. He stayed over one night and had just re upped. Did a shot i caught him warned him. Went to bed and woke up early to make a sale and he was nodded out on my couch (did a shot again) but had every single balloon arranged by color and in bundle count on my kitchen counter! Yes i took like 95 of the hundred bags and when he woke up freaking out i told him i had people in n out all morning why was he disrespecting my house fixing up again and leaving shit out like that. I mean that was a 2grand mistake lol. Yes i was a bad person...mostly to that guy tho. I gets my payback later.

Edit: you must want to know about the dope! It was tar. Good tar. We were all heavy users and 3 singles .1 to .15 each was all the heaviest user could really do. I always gave W dope and 3 bags was fine but if i dropped a balloon and he found it and did 4 he went out. This stuff was gooooood. I was doing about ten bags a day. We had people close to us half keys of 4mmc and we got really into shooting that shit in mass quantities. I would watch W do a half gram shot and his hips would stick up from the couch and he would hump the air uncontrollably while his eyes rolled into the back of his head and his jaw so crazy he couldn't speak even tho he really wanted to tell u how awesome that shot was. You could redose the shit all night like coke. We had a party with like an oz out one time and this poor girl was too fuckef up to hit and i kid you not 6 spunions all surrounded her all with loaded bent ass used bloody rigs like eyeing her with one eye open offering to hit her like EEEEEK. Miss that shit bad.

Me and W thought we were on our way to the top. Me and him lived in a 1br apt with sometimes up to 4 100lb professional german shepherd show dogs at a time. W went to work with his uncle every day and kept the clean act up and uncle rewarded us with a badasssss town home 250k plus we were renting to own basically.

We had a nicer house than we could have imagined at 21 and 22. He moved up ranks at work and i had so much cash my high ass didnt even count it like i shouldve. Unlimited free dope for us. I ran a pretty tight ship and other than a couple bad OD scares during parties (one i will never forget was during a mephedrone rager that ruined me just getting glowstick number 2 in Cs ass. Had to rush dude to hospital with a car full of people whod been shooting crazy huge 4mmc shots ALL night. Me C and dudes friend end up in notoriously strict small town police station at 2am...i was only one coherent enough to say we found OD kid at a party no one would help so we good citizens saved him) we thought we had it going on. This is when C started to work her magic.

So I mean the whoreness and willingness to rob her ex who was supposed to be her bff or whatever and the heroin addiction would have been red flags to most normal people that chick was off and no good to wife up but i found myself engaged.

She was a smart girl tho. Conniving as all hell. She was the kind of chick who would seek out guys with girlfriends and fuck them and then tell. Married guys too. I was at her moms in this old playroom of hers and i stumbled across some paper she had from HS i guess where she'd listed all the dudes shed slept with and number of times. Boyfriends obv got name - 10000x but that shit was like triple columned with some of her parents friends names. It was alot. I told myself it was not a bang list at the time but she was ""goin"". Fa sho. Heh. Speaking of the playroom and this is real fucked up but her stepdad molested her and her mom didnt leave the guy and we had to move in with them at one point and when u hear ""you cant fuck me in here my stepdad used to"" and then u go downstairs to get a glass of milk and hes standing there like hey buddy it fucks u up. The mom was nice and we would talk about what happened and the girls hid the abuse (older sis too) for years until they were well into their teens and hog ass wild and no one knew what to believe but anyways i felt like i had to stay with her and protect her.

Anyways this part is really what i meant to get at...how she came between me and my best friend.

C and W got along but i mean we were higgggggghhhhh. And C was real girly and decorated like idk rustic artsy fartsy stuff on the walls and shit and she cooked and i mean we had a nice place but we were young and a womans touch really tied the crib together.

Shit started to get a bit tense bw me and W and it really had nothing to do with C at first. He was jealous he had to get up and work every day while i got to stay home with all the diesel sleep all day fuck my girl have all the $$$. He still worked for his uncle and had to put on a gameface every day and even tho i kept the bills paid kept dope around 24/7 and all that he was just jelly. And i dont blame him. C wanted me all to herself and wanted all the attention and she capitalized on the situation.

I really never had more than ten thousand or around there but i always had work (more valuable than money if your a junkbox like me) and if i only had had a thousand id have thought i was rich so i slacked on keeping close count of my money and my bags like i should have. I also ate alot of benzos and would do shit like go hit macys up blacked out and spend 700 on buttondowns and shoes and not remember until i opened my closet and seen the shit so yeah. But money started to come up missing. My cash and dope stayed in my closet and i would just KNOW i left 6000 in a particular shoebox and id come home and maybe 1200 would be gone. Or i would swear i had 10 bundles in a jacket pocket and then there would be 7. Now i would have given W anything and i mean yeah hed ask for dope or a lil $$ and i gotchu fam. But shit was starting to get tense with us and C fanned the ole flames. Telling me i was a pussy for letting him steal. Blah blah blah blah. And then he out of the blue was talking shit about me behind my back. Then he was trying to fuck her whenever they were alone.",1522349649.0

The most consistent thing with people successfuly getting and staying clean is finding a replacement for the drugs. And a  reason for living.

Quitting leaves a huge void that needs to be filled.

It's miserable being in an out of rehab, wanting so badly to be clean but never finding the magic solution.

There's so many tools to be learned in meetings that help, but mostly it just replaces the void that drugs used to fill. And gives you a reason to get out of bed.

Community and relationships are so important. Get stoked for your passions in life again. Once the receptors repair real joy can be felt, from other places than the barrel of a syringe. But the repair takes time, maintenance therapy can help make that wait less painful.

**Finding a purpose for life is the answer**. Feeling needed. Letting your body repair to feel real joy and happiness again.

This is the hardest fight ever. I wouldn't wish it on my enemy.

Well fuck me and fuck heroin. The entire 7 paychecks I got while being miserable in an office job went to the dealers just to stay well enough to go I to work to earn. A cycle of vicious insanity..

I've had to use a tiny amount every day to get through. It was pay day today and I get a text from my god damn dboy saying he will deliver. So lunch break I run to an ATM. 20 minutes later I'm out front in his car. 10 minutes after that I'm in a toilet cubicle.. then, Uh-Oh, back at my desk I realise I've left  the foil tube in the toilet..


Aaaand, inevitably, 30 minutes after that I'm in a private meeting with the managers questioning me about my toilet habits, whether or not I use drugs.  I know where this is leading . 
They ask to empty my pockets. No chance. I ask what they'll do if I don't.

They say they'll fire me on the spot as they have reason to believe I've been using drugs 

Fine. I say. I quit. Gathered my stuff, handed in my door card and walked out.

To be honest, I was holding onto the job because of the money and stability, but the stress of repetitive office work was pushing me over the edge. The petty nature of every mistake (think Office Space), dealing with customers who are morons, meetings about meetings about targets.

I'm glad I didn't have to finish out the month and I didn't even get asked if I was okay just told to leave. Thanks for caring. Thanks for allowing me to explain. Just - no drugs at work, all the months spent getting to know you as a person above and beyond being just a manager meant nothing.

This person to person interaction reminded me of another time... Being at the doctor asking for help. Easily just as cold, total lack of empathy, incredible poker face showing absolutely no hint of emotion whatsoever.


So, I've left the company, collected all my stuff (shut, just remembered I forgot my phone charger) and it's payday today. No additional work done, no arguments there.. you think they will call the police or anything or is that the end of it? Do managers just deal with it or will this get sent up the flagpole to the CEO (most likely as he deals with everything and is CC'd in on every little detail that happens)


I wonder what he will make of it.

I can't believe I was in and out the company in less that 5 minutes. Gotta be some sort of record. I just pray that it truly is over now.

They don't have anything on me actually, all circumstantial and I wouldn't open the tin in my pocket so I didn't reveal anything. I think the only thing they have is a really tiny (about 5cm³) burnt piece of foil.

Any thoughts?

Edit to reply to some replies:


------------

- Regarding claiming benefits:

I'm in the UK, so I don't know how it works here. Basically, I don't think they have anything on me except for finding a piece of foil, somehow attributing it to me and then interviewing me and I refuse to empty my pockets for 'personal reasons'.

They said that they have 'reason to believe' and that if I don't prove myself then I'm fired on the spot. I didn't admit to anything, they can't prove anything and it seems we both made it easy for one another (I walk out agreeing to quit on the spot, they don't have to do any paperwork or disciplinary hearing or anything. The whole thing is over in less than 3 minutes)

- To everyone who has read this as me blaming everyone but myself. You couldn't be more wrong.


Has everyone read what I wrote completely wrong? Why is everyone telling me the bleeding obvious.. I know what I did wrong.. I know the company drug policy. I expected everything that happened, I was half expecting it to happen at some point - but I did my very best to avoid screwing up.. but unfortunately, circumstance as they were, it was payday, the guy who has been keeping me well for all this time decides to present an addict with an opportunity he cannot turn down and I went too far.

Look - I'm not blaming anyone but myself and I wouldn't and couldn't do so in good conscience.. Of course I'm upset at myself more than anyone - especially because of all the time I spent trying to get well and not being able to make it.

What I'm really pissed about is that I've busted my ass to conform to something a company wants, only so that ultimately, I can work my ass off for someone else and be a tiny cog in a giant corporate machine. It was a really difficult and stressful job anyway. The introduced a policy where if you don't take a day sick leave that month, you get an extra $200 in your monthly pay.. Consider that for a moment. The job is so stressful, it was pushing people to take sick leave to get well again and I haven't had a single day off since I started in September - all that means that no matter how sick I was, I always went in - way above and beyond almost everyone else working in my department.

Let's be clear - I never once nodded out. I was using to stay well and make it into work. I was using so little that by the time 5pm end-of-shift rolled round, I was already sweating and feeling sick, waiting to get back home to use the tiny bit more that I saved ready and waiting for me.

Please understand, at no point was I using for pleasure (which would likelytake probably $100 a day, and I was using closer to 20-30 a day.

- As for expecting some sympathy. I don't. I joined the company with a habit expecting to be able to fix it at some point. However, I wasn't expecting sympathy from the policies the company has set up with regards people using drugs on site and at work - however, I was talking about the individual people I have met and gotten to know. Absolutely stone cold. After all the emails that I got sent by my manager asking if I was okay when I was sick with the flu and a severe chest infection that was doing the rounds within the department. If I was coping okay with stress - because my mum had an major hip replacement operation and my dad has been diagnosed with dementia. These facts somehow made it out of co-worker discussion and up to my manager. What I am saying is that there were numerous occasions where it seemed like I was being worried about - now when I look back it seems less about caring about me as a person and more about being asked if any personal issues are going to affect me and my performance as a worker because as I said, when it came down to leaving because of what could be percieved as srug problem - who cares about me - I'm obviously incapable of work now, I've got to go. The ultimate kick in the teeth - no income, severe mental health problem, underlying personal reasons for doing this in the first place - fuck all that. Stone cold goodbye.

882ecu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/882ecu/plugging_vs_snorting_dilaudid_hydromorphone/,27,https://redd.it/882ecu,Algoresdog,Plugging vs snorting Dilaudid (hydromorphone),"Let's be very clear - I have a 3 year habit of almost exclusively dilaudid and I can tell you with 100% certainty that plugging is a much more effective ROA. There are websites that suggest that it's actually a lower absorption rate, but I believe that data is flawed.

 Based on my experience, you will get anywhere from 10-25% stronger effects from plugging hydromorphone. Furthermore, the effects will last anywhere from 2-3 times as long. The only mild advantage to insufflation would be probably 10-20% stronger rush, if that.

The caveat here is that you MUST be sure the receiving area is clear. I would recommend buying a cheap low volume enema from Walmart ($1). I prefer to empty the saline since it is almost painfully effective and simply use water. I insert one enema, refill, and then do one more. I then move around as much as possible to get it mixed up, and 5-10 minutes later will void my bowels. 

The best administration device I've found is the 5ml syringe found in children's equate brand Tylenol. It has plenty of room for dosages up to 50mg while being skinny enough to not hurt when inserted. The 10ml syringes that they sell separately are certainly effective but I find the size of it is just uncomfortable to put in my anus. The best way to avoid losing any product in preparation is to place the pills inside the syringe, and draw up water, then allow it to dissolve for anywhere from 20-30 minutes. In this way you can avoid losing residue involved in crushing and transferring. You will also not have to worry about potentially spilling part of your dose.

Once you've cleared the receiving area and your dose is ready, use Vaseline to lubricate and make sure the syringe is fully inside your anus (all the way to where the push syringe starts. There will be a slightly larger lip that should prevent you from pushing the syringe in any further. Don't push further! Losing a syringe in your ass is certainly not worth it and you won't get any benefits from going deeper than this). After pushing it out inside, refill the syringe with water and redose to get all the residue. This will also help make sure there's plenty of volume of water in there. 

After administration, lay with your legs in the air up against a wall so that the dose goes downward towards your head. Stay in that position for roughly 2-3 minutes and after that you can do whatever you want.

Hope this helps anyone who's wondering best ROAs for dillies. Remember to be safe and consider that potency increase if you're used to snorting. The best option for a first time plugger will be to plug 1/2-3/4 of your normal dose, and from there you can add on via insufflation if you feel the need. That way you are working all your possible routes of administration and you don't have to worry about possibly overdosing. 

Good luck to all, and happy nods.",1522338974.0

I want to support this community and am excited to now be part of it!**

feel free to add, correct me, comment, ask or anything else. can discuss other medication interactions too :) lets make this an interaction thread stressing safety.

**eg with codeine+valium mix**

* INormal codeine metabolism:* Codeine metabolised to morphine by effect of (example) 10% capacity CYP2D6 enzyme used, 20% capacity of CYP3A4 into norocodeine (inactive mostly

* INormal valium metabolism:* metabolised to temazepam significantly by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 eventually to oxazepam (not important in this particular interaction.

* Normally. lorazepam/ativan is glucuronidated to compounds. Morphine relies on glucuronidation also in order to break it down; Thus atvan before morphine (or codeine, which ends up morphine), may prolong the effects if morphine.

**IF VALIUM TAKEN BEFORE CODEINE:** CYP3A4 enzyme is going to be depleted or saturated with valium molecules, More codeine funneled to CYP2D6 as 3A4 pathway blocked to an extent (depends on dosages etc), thus more than 10% morphine of codeine dose potentially created.

Add this to addirive CNS depressant effects, may be dangerous. 

*TLDR*: valium (in this particular discussion/case, signfiicantly potentiates the metabolism of opiates/opioids such as codeine, oxy etc due to valiums strong binding affinity to the 3A4 enzyme, basically preventing (eg) codeine from using that pathway, so itll use more towards 2D6, the active morphine compound. This doesnt consider additional problems like additive CNS depressant effects

I had to retrain for it, and when I say retrain I mean I had to work full time whilst studying for a postgraduate degree in order to do it professionally. That was between summer 2015 and summer 2017. I took a short break during the Autumn, and now I'm back in the city I belong in, doing the job I've always thought I'd be really good at.

And with this responsibility comes great rewards: a salary I didn't think I'd be earning until I'd gained at least a couple more years experience in the field. 

But, you know when you start a new job and they don't process your paperwork fast enough? So they stick you on an emergency tax code, and you end up getting a lot less per month than you thought you would?

Well, that was January's paycheck *and* February's paycheck - two pretty tight months. But, March's paycheck? The paycheck that went into my account at midnight last night? Well, that *was* my full salary, along with a rebate of the tax they took too much of during January and February. 

When I opened the payslip yesterday I almost screamed. 

And so I stayed up till midnight, and when I saw that money clear I called my delivery boy instantly for a nice little heap of beautiful brown dirt-looking gear; the money cleared at midnight and by 12.30 I was nodding peacefully in the knowledge that every month from now on I'll be getting money equivalent to my hard work at that job, the hard work I've been doing for three months, and the hard work I trained for two years to do.

This, along with the fact that today was my last day in that job for a full paid two weeks off: I'm not back there till Monday 16th, and I've got more money to play with than I've ever had in my life.

I'm a functioning addict - yes, I know I am. Possibly a high-functioning one. My addiction doesn't impact my ability to do my job. No, it doesn't.
