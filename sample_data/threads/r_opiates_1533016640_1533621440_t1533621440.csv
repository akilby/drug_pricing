EDIT: having been on Vivitrol for awhile I've been using from day 28 since my last shot through day 32, so 5 days actually. However I've felt next to nothing for the 5 days, meaning most of my receptors are still blocked with more than lingering amounts of Vivitrol apparently. Not sure if that would play a role in the physical dependency or not because withdrawal occurs as the remaining opiates in your body are leaving the receptors so it sounds like that might factor in.",1533614389.0

Today I went to a neurologist, talked with him, and for the first time he doesnt judge me, and he knew a lot bout opiates. I told of my huge habit 500mg/day of morphine IV, told that I wanted a bupe/methadone taper, and finally got it.

But I got a few questions, he didnt know about precipitated wds, for example. He prescribed my a 20mg patch, without naloxone, just bupe (transdermal system, only avaiable here, we dont have in pills form). The patch is supposed to least a week, with peak in 3 days. 

His plan is to taper me on bupe, then put me on fentanyl patches (we have fentanyl transdermal patches) that patch should least 3 days, and then methadone, and then off, I didnt understand that, it should be from methadone to bupe, right? and the fentanyl too wtf

I took 80mg today of methadone (where I get my morph, when the pharm doesnt have morph, I buy dones), and tomorrow I will pick up my morphine (already paid before that), so I dont gonna go to bupe before I end this 60 pills of 30mg morph. 

I was thinking in staying in morph for 7 days, got methadone off my system, and then wait 24h after my last morphine dose. I think its gonna be a little smoother, can someone give me an advice?

He looked different as he had in the past. We made contact and the way those eyes penetrated my soul, it made my heart skipped a beat, which made it beat faster. My forehead heated up, remembering the passion flowing through me, while flirting with him. 
I remembered the hold he had on me, the one where I would run away screaming, only to come back when I thought I couldn‚Äôt live without him. 
I decided to walk up to my old lover to see if he recognized how far I have gotten, without him in my life.
I remembered why I loved him so much, while he touched my lips and was so gentle. I felt my face blush, yet didn‚Äôt want him to stop. My breath drew quickly, from his touch. 
So many thoughts running through my head as he kissed me, so passionately. I immediately wondered if I could go all the way and not get sucked in, as I did before. I wondered if I could let go, once the passion turned toxic. I thought of the previous time, the hurt and pain it caused. Getting over it I thought I was going to die, to wake up and feel like I haven‚Äôt sleep, eyes constantly tearing up, thoughts of suicide and a depressive state occupied my head for months. I grappled with what to do, as I slipped back into familiar territory. I knew I would allow that lust to come back into my life again ...
And again ...
I kiss back, praying inside and telling myself I can handle it this time. It was more of an attempt of convincing myself that I would not let the love overpower me once again. Yet I fell, I allowed myself to fall in love/lust once again. 

When will I abandon this love I have?  I can drop a destructive boyfriend in a minute but this destructive love I can‚Äôt let go of.

.. Im currently taking 3 to 4 Percocet 10s a day.. 150 lbs, 27 yr old female, been using the tabs/percs for 3 years-ish daily and 2 years before i got back on the tabs/percs, i kicked my 1.5 year opana addiction on my own, only to end up working opiates back into my life slowly but surley a couple years later. So you can say on and off for 7 or 8 years.. 

 For a year I have been doing weekly mental health therapy sessions to help with my c-ptsd, anxiety, depression and panic attacks- basically trying to treat my mental health issues and develop new coping mechanisms to make my risk of relapse lower.. I feel like i finally have faith in myself in getting sober and i feel like i am in a much better place mentally than i have ever been. Also have been doing physical therapy to help with my pain so i dont have as big of an excuse to reach for pain pills/to rationalize my usage. 

Now, i have been weening down to only 5mg at a time some times and trying to stretch my dose out to every 5 or 6 hours instead of taking 10mg every 4 hours. Its kind of torture as im very moody and that weird tingle feeling of my bones jumping out of my skin is the worst.. But none the less im trying to make it easier for when my quit day comes.. Which im hoping will be in 2 weeks.

Here is my actual question:
I know you likely arent doctors but in your experience and opinion, is detoxing alone safe for someone of my dosage? Im kind of wanting to rent a cheap cabin in the woods for 5 or 6 days and just bite the bullet- away from my bf who i dont want to lash out at due to my pain and anger and anxiety that rushes to the surface, away from everyone and everything that could be a trigger. I have valium to use to ease the withdrawl and im not wanting to use suboxone. I am not the kind of addict that goes balls to the walls with any old substance- i dont like anxiety meds enough for the valium to be a problem and will take them safely- opaites is my weakness, not anxiety meds and i know how to ration and control myself with those valiums so i dont think that part will be an issue. 

Have any of you detoxed off this amount? Did you do it alone? What do you think about this plan? I Just want to make sure im not going to have some physical reaction that could cause me to die or something.. I have heard opaite withdrawal cannot kill you unlike alcohol withdrawal. Any insight would be appreciated.

Idk how the fuck they thought threatening to call the cops was a good idea but once they said they were going to call the cops I went ahead and did it myself.     
       
The cops wanted to rip the house apart and charge them all with so many things. Assault (of which I have video of the threats of violence and the assault itself), drug charges out the ass (of which I have voice recordings of them admitting to stealing my medications), international drug trafficking since they brought pills back from Europe 4 times and admitted on audio recording, the list goes on.

But I'm free.      
     
Nobody is going to steal my scripts, or accuse me of things that aren't real. If I succeed, it's all because of me. If I fail, it's all because of me.

Especially if it's uneventful and doesn't warrant added attention to detail. Some have expressed disappointment, a smaller subset of which I suspect are not pulling my leg when they say ""this post sucks, it's not ams good as when something bad happens to you."" Of course I'm paraphrasing and I don't think anyone genuinely wants harm to come my way. They just want me to experience enough shenanigans to make the store worth reading. I get it. 


&nbsp;

Yesterday I agreed to drop by his house to have some birthday cake and to catch up for twenty minutes. He said ""even if you go out, drop in on your way back for cake for like twenty minutes."" While riding my bike home from work I was abit hungry and reluctant to go to Cliffs -- I had cold feet. He called once and I cursed my phone a few times, I scream ""fucking shit"" or something with the ""F"" word and when I neared a pedestrian I turned my head and said ""pardon me."" Well, there goes my hope that he'd pass out and forget that I'd be getting off work. I decided to pull over and think.

&nbsp;
 
Right off the bat I knew that his house would likely smell bad, maybe worse and maybe worse because of my senses being mal-adapted. So I decided to eat my cold slice of pizza outside on the service road as I read responses to my last post on Reddit. This was the only way I could enjoy this pizza aside from going home first. After the pizza biked to a deli then called Cliff back to announce the fact that I shall be arriving shortly. The plan was to secure my bike outside and then to leave my backpack on the hood of the car in the driveway - there was no way or reason for me to bring that backpack inside the house. One less item that in need of thorough decontamination. Still treated it as though it was contaminated since I did put the backpack on my back when I left.

&nbsp;


#Upon opening the door

A fruitfly entered my mouth, I spat it out and sputtered my lips lightly to ensure nothing else gained entry. Right after that I noticed the smell, a sense that is linked to memory and remembered other times I'd enter at the start of a wait which I no longer engage in. We greeted one another and shook hands, it was a little sticky and presumably sweaty. The cake was just taken out, an icing cake as opposed to ice cream cake. I chose the plastic chair since it carried a lower risk of bed bug infestation. 


&nbsp;

A cake, a cola and a paper towel for a napki, the lst of which rapidly became forfeit when I saw a family of fruit flies crawling along it's textured surface. Hell, one fly ended up on the icing of my cake - I blew on it really hard until it left because it wouldn't leave when I tried flicking it with my spoon. What am I to do? Fuck it, it's just a fruit fly as opposed to a full grown house fly. 



**Fact:** A fly's mouth is like an elephant trunk, except that it squirts vomit in order to externally digest food enabling the fly to slurp it up! So, when a fly lands on your food, it stands to be reasoned that it's going to at least drool a little bit of vomit.


&nbsp;


So anyway, of course he was curious and seemed genuinely interested in what I was up to, what my potential job opportunity was and so forth. He called out to his mom, ""that's right near where you used to work."" I forgot some details but after eating the cake he asked if I'd stick aroudn another 15-20 minutes to check movie times. Sure I could do 10-25-20 minutes but I must be up early tomorrow I said in order to set expectations. We ultimately conclude that Wednesday or Thursday is the best day to see the movie and we  briefly discuss candy. Things like when and where to get the candy... he says ""maybe we'll make a stop on the way"", which I pointed out is not ideal with a cab or Uber.

&nbsp;


Basically I said I'd be happy to get the candy before the movie so we don't have to make a stop. He gets paid that day and says he's buying the tickets so I'd be neither suprised or annoyed if I'm expected to get the candy as it's quite fair. Cliff did mention that he'd probably get a soda at the thetre because a 20 ounce soda won't last too long. That's fine, though now I think about it, he could just buy a liter. It's not like his baggy shorts couldn't accomodate it.


Oh speaking of shorts. He had to pull up his pants for lack of a belt before we sat down, but I noticed that this pair of shorts were more ripped than his boxers which havve appeared in the past to only consist of the elastic waist band and a layer of cloth on one side but not both and not contiguously. 

&nbsp;


Well anyway, I'm not here to shit on his fashion - just mentioning because I'm damn near certain he's not going to wear these shorts to the movie but if he did the weight of a soda would pull them down and it would be very unwieldy.

I mean like, I shouldn't speak too ill in this particular post because he's offering to do something nice - to buy me a movie ticket. To do a wholesome activity that friends do which does not neccesitate consumption of drugs.


&nbsp;

Speaking of drugs, he offered me an oxy pill (to be crushed into a line) three times ""for old times sake."" Each time I declined, first time I was clear that I don't pass judgement on people's choices in terms of partying in this manner but that I've come so far and that I do not want to reset my counter now. He acknowledged in an understanding manner and continued along. As we spoke about his pay day coming up he also casually inquired if I was getting paid this Thursday. I casually said, maybe... but I mean like obviosuly yes. I know when I get paid and Cliff knows I wouldn't not know. 


nbsp;


I didn't ask him why he cared when I was getting paid but I did state ""yeah, I'll have no trouble getting candy."" I didn't snap as I would have back when  I was in the game. I used to snap and say ""I'm not spending my whole paycheck on dope!"" Like to head-off expecations that used to exist. From the bygone era when I only bought dope through Cliff and if it was my pay day and not his was loaning out dope thereby doubling my cost while cutting my own enjoyment in half.


In this case, I can't quite read between the lines. It's not as simple as mid November when he mentioned plans of buying a brick of dope so that neither of us would be sick through the holiday. Of course the implication was that I'd be chipping in on that brick, which in itself isn't unfair but I was not letting him butter me up to that idea at the time because I knew that if it turned out he didn't get paid on time that I'd be the one buying the brick until he could pay me back for his share of it. At the time I said ""I'm not spending all my money on a brick."" To which he'd respond, ""I'm not saying that you are.""


Point is, many times it became possible to read between the lines in order to identify Cliff's unstated intentions.



Like I said, in this case I must be rusty because I can't seem to figure out what he may be plotting, if anything at all. He may yet still just genuinely want to see this movie and nothing else but I can't help but expect a ""gotcha"" or ""one other thing."" Maybe it was a genuine inquiry just to ensure that I would be able to buy candy while he buys the movie tickets - as opposed to me being down to my last $20 saying last minute on movie night ""I can't get candy because I paid for the Uber.""


&nbsp;


He wasn't particularly insistent about doing a 15mg linme of oxy ""for old times sake"", aside from offering it three times over the course of thirty minutes but I wouldn't be surprised if on movie night he offered again. I can resist it no matter wahat but I hope for his sake he isn't overly insistent on it. That will reduce the liklihood of me hanging with him in the future. Even so, I can't spend long chunks of time in his house. The bugs and the smell. My shirt smelled like a combination of mold-food when I got home and took it off. The sweat and humidity makes it way worse than in winter.

&nbps;

In conclusion, I don't have time to edit this post because I have to be ready for something important in less than one hour. I had every intention of keeping this post short since there was no action or anything bad that happened to me. I bet if I typed this on my smartphone it would've been way shorter. 


Will check back after movie night for another Cliffpost.",1533573278.0

I'm an early 20's recreational dope user out here in PA. Non-IV of course, as I've seen too many friends die and way too many friends continue to deal with addiction today. And while thinking about all of that, it really makes me wonder if there's more people out there like me, who aren't even a tad bit addicted; those who can drop it like a dime as if it never even happened. I remember the first time I had sniffed dope.. shit I hadn't gotten sick until I sniffed this bag from New Jersey, and I was already a seasoned user by then. I've never dealt with any type of withdraw, ever; Just the normal pain of bills, weed and money budgeting.

are lyrics about codeine and lean in rap songs just filler words? surely people can't actually be addicted to this stuff, right? it's incredibly weak, and loses nearly all effect after you've developed even a small tolerance.

is it the placebo effect perhaps?

The complexity of the corruption and the vast amounts of energy expended at the express purpose of forcing others to suffer disgusts me, and it has ever since I was old enough to understand what was really going on around me. At the same time I am overly empathetic and tend to genuinely care about the well-being of others,  friends, family and strangers, so my anger does not get expressed through the disrespect or mistreatment of other individuals. Instead of taking out my anger on other people I take it out on myself. Over time, the inner rage develops into a hatred manifesting itself as my own thorough type of self-destruction. It is one of my basic needs to relieve myself of the anger, rage and confusion justified ironically by the continued injustices experienced by my generation while trying to survive in modern American society. Which is why the worst decisions I make always feel the best. As much as I try to tell myself, as much as I try to believe that I can be happy, successful and healthy, I will ultimately restrict myself from achieving any goals that are purported to be ‚Äúpositive.‚Äù  I think now that I can be actually happy by excepting this recent realization as a self diagnosis and running with it. Thus, actually relieve myself of much of the guilt that I create just as a byproduct of convincing myself that my decisions are ‚Äúbad.‚Äù  It‚Äôs time for me to truly disconnect from the ideas, judgments and opinions of society at large. I‚Äôm not the one suffering from some type of mental illness I‚Äôm just one of the few sane individuals wandering around this insane society.

It was dark black tar with a pungent aroma. He only worked from 11 in the morning till 8 at night. We‚Äôd call the number, which was really to one of his buddies sitting in a house and tell his buddy where we were. That guy would use a walkie talkie or boost mobile to tell Victor. They always said, ‚ÄúTwenny meenus. Twenny meenus,‚Äù but it was never twenty minutes. It usually took him a whole hour or two of neighborhood residents and store managers eyeing us as we waited and looked suspicious sitting on a random street corner curb.

I did half gram shots of it. That was a good dose for me. The stuff that I‚Äôd gotten from Fin and Jimbo, though, was way better than Victor‚Äôs stuff. Fin told me to be careful, so I was. I poured three match heads worth into that little aluminum cooker and didn‚Äôt even have to cook it. It turned the water translucent brown with a swirl of the black rubber plunger.

I always say that the rush, for me anyway, is like an elephant stepping my chest or back. I have always attributed it to the constriction of bronchiole tubes and veins that made it feel like that, and as I sat on that orange bucket next to a dirty mop and some piping running through 2x4 studs, I thought it might be too much. It scared me. Getting up and getting to where Fin and Jimbo could see me would be the best bet as far as being where someone could watch me and call the ambulance, but it wasn‚Äôt that serious. Sublime slumber. The nod lasted until late afternoon and the day glowed blue in the streets and warm yellow lights turned on through the windows in the city.

I stood up satisfied with what I‚Äôd gotten from that last hit. Jimbo handed me a cup of coffee in a Styrofoam cup. It was cold. I spit it out. Fin was watching TV and smoking another joint. The fat dalmatians still laying at his feet.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you do that for?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? So?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúK.‚Äù He took the cup and put it to his lips. He drank. I grimaced.

‚ÄúYou like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. I like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever. So, the stuff‚Äôs really good.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mess with it myself, but you know that. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs the best.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd say so. What does the Faceless One want with Bug‚Äôs eye, anyway?‚Äù

The Faceless One had been a pimp and dealer in the 80s when crack was first hitting the streets in a big way. They called him Joseph Junior back then. He‚Äôd gotten to be notorious and feared, but one of the girls who worked for him got killed by a John while she was working.

As if having your daughter working in the sex trade and turned out for dope isn‚Äôt bad enough, her father lost his mind when she got murdered. He found Joseph Junior and pretended to be a customer, but when he got close enough, he opened a bottle of sulfuric acid and threw it in his face. Supposedly, the skin on his face had been completely melted to the skin on his shoulders and chest. Teeth stuck out. It was hard to tell where his jaw had been. His eyes had turned into milky blue orbs. He was blind. Reconstructive surgery only did so much according to Jimbo, who acted as a liaison between street thugs like me and the Faceless One. He‚Äôd seen him once. The rest of their correspondence was through the first girl to ever work for the Faceless One, now a middle aged Russian woman named Natalia. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to know that. Jimbo always told me more than he should have.

Since then, his power had only grown. Legend on the streets had it that he appealed to Satan himself during one of the first surgeries during which the anesthesia almost killed him. Now, his body was inhabited by some evil and ancient entity. He wasn‚Äôt Joseph Junior anymore. He hadn‚Äôt been for years.

‚ÄúListen to me, Boom Boom. What the Boss wants with Bug‚Äôs eye is anyone‚Äôs guess. I don‚Äôt ask. If it were up to me, I‚Äôd be out of this whole thing, but now I‚Äôm involved. I can‚Äôt get out or else you might be coming for my eye next.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd never.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd never but you never know what happens when you‚Äôre pushed.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. But you know me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. You‚Äôre good people, so I‚Äôm gonna let you know something.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour friend. You know the one that tells everyone he‚Äôs your brother?‚Äù

‚ÄúRufus?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Rufus.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWord is he needs to stay away from that woman he‚Äôs been talking to.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù

‚ÄúJaqueline Onassis over there on the bench by the bay.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlly Alcoholic?‚Äù She wore glasses and a bandana on her head at all times and always sat on the same bench. She was pretty too, except for her legs which stuck out of the one-piece bathing suit she always wore. They were plum colored and bent unnaturally like baby doll arms.

‚ÄúIs that what you guys are calling her now?‚Äù

‚ÄúHer name is Allison McDonald but yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. He needs to stay away from her. I know you care about him.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what if he doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell you know better than I do what happened to Bug.‚Äù

I knew he was talking about some obscure command which had come from the Faceless One to him about Rufus talking to Ally. It didn‚Äôt make sense. There was nothing I could do about it though and nothing Jimbo could do either. I hoped Rufus would listen when he got out.

‚ÄúI do. K. Jimbo, I‚Äôm out.‚Äù I waved to Fin. ‚ÄúSee ya, Fin.‚Äù

‚ÄúBe careful out there.‚Äù They said in unison.

Jimbo‚Äôs shop was only a few blocks from where we usually slept. After everything I‚Äôd just heard about Rufus and the Faceless One from Jimbo and Bug‚Äôs eye, I felt empty.  Probably the heaviest thing was that Rufus wasn‚Äôt with me. As much as I hated the way he smelled and obnoxious ramblings about nothing, I missed him. The rain fell in soft black whispers on the asphalt. I sat under our overhang on a piece of cardboard.

*A half ounce of the best.* I thought. My package sat inside of my backpack which I had opened at the top and held the stash I‚Äôd just gotten. I stroked it like my pet. I pulled the same needle I‚Äôd used earlier at Jimbo‚Äôs and got ready to fix again for the night.",1533520177.0

**DANGER**: Using large amounts of Imodium and/or using Imodium over a long period of time can cause heart damage and other bodily damage up to **death**. I am not a medical expert and can not recommend using Imodium as a safe withdrawal method. I have used up to 40-50mg of straight Loperamide a day to minimize withdrawal symptoms accepting the possible risks associated with it, but I've never exceeded 60mg and have never taken it consecutively more than 3 days, and then only take it when absolutely necessary (maybe twice a month). 

There have been deaths from users who reportedly were taking 100s of mgs a day repeatedly. I have heard anecdotally of Imodium addicts taking ~100mg a day, and some have reported heart damage. Loperamide addiction is one of the most dangerous drug addictions one can have - it is *known* to be cardiotoxic at those dosages, not telling what other damage is caused since Loperamide addiction is relatively new and thus has not been thoroughly studied. Its withdrawals are also surprisingly horrific and probably very long given how long its half-life is. All for a ""high"" that feels more a flu than a real opioid high. 

******************************************************************************************

Regardless, Loperamide has been a lifesaver for me during withdrawal - not just for withdrawals but for overall symptoms, **especially** RLS. With a ~1g/day IV heroin it, taking 40-50mg/day reduced almost every physical withdrawal symptom. I can even sleep with it, which is a *miracle* while in withdrawal. In fact, that's about all I do while using it during withdrawal, since while it makes withdrawal *bearable* it doesn't make them go away completely. 

Anyway - finally to my point - I've been able to buy straight Loperamide (Imodium) pills (small green pills 2mg each) for ages at just about any Walmart or grocery store in the country, they've recently been starting to crack down on them. Which is just lovely, because now at my local Walmart the only options are some liquid concoction which I've never tried before, and these new capsules that are 2mg Loperamide and 125mg Simethicone. They're a lot bigger than the traditional small green pills too, so it'll definitely be a lot harder to swallow the 15-24 I usually do for a day.

Anyway, how safe is Simethicone? It worries me a bit that they've added it to their formula. Looking it up it appears to be an anti-gas agent. If I take 15-24 pills then that is 30-48mg of Loperamide and 1875-3000mg of Simethicone. 

Has anyone had any experience using pills with this before? Will that dosage of Simethicone make me drop dead or otherwise cause organ damage? 

If there's a better sub to post this question then please redirect me. This whole crackdown on Imodium is annoying the shit out of me. Anyone trying to get ""high"" on Imodium is an absolute moron and risking death or permanent heart damage for a super shitty ""high"" that will feel like a fever high. I'm aware that the dosage I take isn't exactly *safe* either so please don't preach to me - I'm actually hoping to take that amount of Imodium for maybe 4-5 days at most, dropping the dosage each day, to hopefully wean off opiates for a final day and (ideally) say sayonara!

A dry mouth is at risk of decay.   Saliva is like our teeths' first line of defense.  You know how it goes... A cavity shows up and we don't address it until our choices are pulling that tooth or throwing down a few grand for a root canal.  (Don't let me get started on health care, or rather lack of, in the U.S)

Anyway, I know many people who have lost teeth both opioid related and not.  I just watched one of those friends make a diy flipper!  (A flipper is like a denture for one or a few teeth).  

It looks so much better now and she has much more confidence. And the kit was less than $25!

If you are suffering from lack of dental coverage please Google diy dentures.  There are some dental labs that provide low cost kits and kind of walk you through it.

Also don't forget about calling 211, in the U.S. & most of Canada.  They can help you find whatever help or assistance you need.  Maybe there is a local dental clinic that takes patients at no cost once a month.  Or maybe a regional dental school travels to your community occasionally.


Even if you don't care about having a nice smile you need to get your teeth taken care of.  [Poor oral health can have negative impact on the rest of the body](http://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-you/oral-health/7-ways-your-oral-health-affects-your-overall-health/view-all/)

Now one of my connects is bumping prices up from 30 to 40 per blue, clearly with the intent and hope I jump to H, which he‚Äôs already offered me (probably fent laced sugar these days). 

Anyway, just curious as to what your pill habit was at before you jumped to H and how much H did you have to do the first time to match your daily oxy habit? Currently, I sniff 60mgs oxy with 15mg Addy to get out of bed, then redose up to 3 or 4 more times throughout the day usually topping off at 180-240mgs oxy and 45-60 Addy. Also pop a 2mg bar to knock out at night. 

I really don‚Äôt want to make the jump, would rather detox and get clean, but that‚Äôs easier said than done. I also know that any hope I have of getting clean after making the jump to H will go out the window so I doubt it‚Äôll happen. Just curious. Blessings",1533501989.0

I have been doing kratom for about 6 months. I started it to get off oxy, and now I alternate between the two. I'll typically do one or two weeks on one, then switch to the other for one or two weeks. Kratom is much much more affordable, so it saves me a lot of money. 

Kratom, in my experience, is not nearly as enjoyable as something like oxy. However, after experimenting with a lot of doses, I found one that keeps withdrawal and anxiety away. The past few months I've been doing 4-6 grams a day and it keeps me pretty relaxed, feeling normal, some euphoria. However, lately, my normal dose has been making me very jittery. It's the same feeling I was getting from doses like 1-3 grams months ago when I was trying to find a place I liked. Do you guys think this is maybe my tolerance increasing? So now I'm getting the effect of what a lower dose would feel like with no tolerance? Should I try going up a gram or two?

The main reason was that I found out it was his mom's birthday, so I wanted to wish her a happy birthday. After pleasantries, the first order of business was to find out what Cliff was calling about. He even gave the stated that he's not calling to ask for anything from me.I mean yeah he asked me when I was working today and invited me to drop by to have some Birthday cake which his mom was insisting upon. 


&nbsp;


I made it clear that I have to prepare for a job interview tomorrow, he doesn't need to know that I scheduled it for late afternoon or that it's a webcam interview. If I drop in for brithday cake, I want to minimize my exposure - regardless I will have to go through full decon when I get home. Strip in my back yard, check my body and hair then steam my clothes. Of course by then I'll change into clean pants. Maybe I'll create some gonewild content but I wouldn't recommend holding your breath in anticipation.



&nbsp;


Preparation must be made, I really do intend on being in and out. I want to make sure I clean my room for the webcam job interview, make sure my webcam works and if it doesn't do something about it and maybe setup a green screen so I can have a false background for the webcam interview. Something like a big ass hallway, the cargo bay of a star ship or something else cool. Then finally, I want to get a good night's sleep and wake up
 hours before the interview so I'm perky and mentally prepared.

I might even buy a fancy microphone for my computer today just to be on the safe side. It's good having money left over because I'm not spending it on dope.


&nbsp;


Anyway, what has Cliff been calling about? The new Mission Impossible movie. So yes, I guess you could say he wants to go on a movie date with me. Well that's good, it's safer than being invited to watch a movie in his house. I'm bad at saying no and bring confrontation at times and for fuck sake he's inviting me to see a movie with him, how can I justify adopting a hostile tone? So in good faith I'm willing to see the movie with him. For me I'm good as long as I'm not exposed to his smelly bed bug infested home for long periods of time and as long as there is no financial entanglement.


&nbsp;


No financial entanglement but movie tickets do cost money. Well, Cliff says he'll cover my movie ticker and that we'll sort our transportation. I think it's basically a forgone conclusion that if we see this movie that I'll be paying for the $10-$15 cab ride. Still pretty fair. Cliff doesn't like popcorn so if I buy an overpriced bucket of popcorn it'll all be mine! We will likely get candy ahead of time because it's cost effective to go that route and he's more than welcome to get what he wants for himself. If he pays for the cab ride in either or both directions, I wouldn't mind covering snacks from an outside store which I'd likely go to before the cab even picks us up so we don't have to make any stops.

&nbsp;


Overall this is a safer thing than going out to dinner or a bar, none of that ""oohph I forgot my wallet"" and if he doesn't allocate his pay day money towards the movie tickets then we simply don't go. In that regard the choice is his and it can go either way. As long as I'm not buying or using drugs, what could go wrong?

It originated in 19th century Asia, but a vein of revival made its way up from Mexico in the early nineteen nineties. Upon conversion, we sold all we had to follow our goddess. We lived for her, and in back alleys and hotel rooms all around the city, we built altars to her with blackened spoons, the bottom halves of aluminum cans, needles, empty cigarette boxes and the gnawed leather of looped belts.  These were the worn relics of our sacrament and liturgy. We practiced the ritual of cooking magical potions, conjuring up blissful sleep and vapor the smell of vinegar and brown sugar. We vomited and hiccupped as a rite of passage. Daily devoting ourselves, tying ourselves off, kneeling before her altar and letting blood from our arms. We were ready to sacrifice our first born if she asked.

## Heroin was life for us, and without her we were dead. Every heartbeat. Every thought. Every move. Every drop of gasoline in the car. Every cent we made. Every calorie we consumed. Every breath was devoted to the chase for more.

Four Hondurans started selling heroin and cocaine at five in the morning. They came like clockwork, because they got off the first bus that brought them to the park. Besides Chivo, it was the only other place we knew to get heroin in town, and it was the only place it was available at five a.m. Chivo started at eight, but sickness started early. They sold dimes, or ten dollars‚Äô worth, in tightly wrapped balls made from cut squares of trash bag. Black was heroine. White was cocaine. They sold five for 40 dollars as an incentive to buyers and allowed any combination.

We woke up before five, sick as usual. I gathered together the random CDs in the car and went to see if one of the Hondurans in the park would trade a dime of black for them. Roger was the one we knew best, but he laughed at my offer. He seemed annoyed. He would not even look at me.

We were out of luck, so we parked next to a Seven Eleven. In the car, we stretched and yawned. Our bodies ached, and the anxiety set in. We never knew where we would get it. We just had to have it. Watery snot and tears started, the sure signs of dope sickness.

‚ÄúWhat are we going to do, bubby?‚Äù Danielle lay back in the passenger seat.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, baby. I‚Äôm tired. We can call Chivo and ask for another front, or we can do something, but it‚Äôs too early to call Chivo. Let me chill for a minute. We‚Äôll get it. Don‚Äôt worry. I don‚Äôt know how but we will.‚Äù She always said she liked me better when I was sick. Heroine made me extremely mean and difficult. When I was sick, I felt exposed and sensitive. Television commercials brought tears to my eyes, and I was nice to her.

‚ÄúOK, bubby. I‚Äôm sick as s\*\*\*.‚Äù She held her stomach.

‚ÄúI know, baby. Me too.‚Äù I folded my arms and closed my eyes. My back and head ached. I pushed back into the driver‚Äôs seat. Not two minutes passed before we heard a knock on the window.

A strange individual tried to talk to us through the closed window. Thick glasses, a shaved head, orange freckles on pale skin, a gaunt face. Maybe a man. Maybe a lesbian. I tried to tell the person to wait till we rolled the window down, but they continued to talk. As the window lowered, I could hear he was a man.

‚ÄúI need a ride out of here! Right now! I‚Äôve got money! I‚Äôll pay you. I have to get out of this state!‚Äù He seemed genuinely desperate for our help. Through the window he flashed several bills, mostly ones and a five. It was good enough for me.

‚ÄúGet in!‚Äù

Danielle had to open her door to open the door for him to crawl into the back, and we took off.

‚ÄúWhere do you want to go?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know where he went. There was nothing in the back seat, but a pile of clothes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know! Anywhere, out of here!‚Äù His voice came from the clothes. He had buried himself in the pile of unfolded and dirty clothes.

‚ÄúWell, maybe you could give us a little more direction. If you pay, we‚Äôll take you anywhere you want.‚Äù I remembered the condition of my release from jail. My travels were not to exceed a 150-mile radius from there, but money was on the line. He never gave us a destination.

Traffic halted for miles on the interstate. It was from people headed to work, so we were stuck for a while. He talked about the people chasing him. They wanted to kill him, and the cops would send him to prison. He had spent the previous night jumping fences to escape. A day or two before that, he threw away several ounces in a hotel room of the casino, because he thought he was being set up. Danielle and I knew what he needed.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you let us get you some heroin? That‚Äôll calm you down. We can get a hotel room and get some brown. Hey, what‚Äôs your name anyway? If we are going to be helping you escape and partners in crime, we should know each other‚Äôs names.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Carl.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Riley. This is Danielle.‚Äù

He agreed that getting heroin was a good idea, so we pulled off at the next exit, and called Chivo. We found a Motel 6, and she checked into the room, for us. He snuck in while we waited for Chivo. We never had much money to score, so Chivo‚Äôs driver hurried to meet us at the gas station down the street. Out of the four 50-dollar balloons, Carl gave us three to share, which he did several more times. He always gave us three and kept one. It was Christmas morning, and we were little kids.

When Danielle and I got high, we bickered and said nasty things to one another, not as a matter of any real hurt or problems we had, but like an allergic reaction to the heroin. There were two or three days in a row of us sitting in a dark, cool Motel 6 room watching HBO high on heroin and Danielle and I squabbling. Carl spent time on his computer and whined about our fussing and fighting.

‚ÄúYou guys should love one another. You never know when you won‚Äôt have the other one with you again.‚Äù He whimpered. His life was hard, one of six boys, the youngest, and regularly raped by one of his brothers. His father hated him. He found love with an old man named Tony, who taught him the trade of stealing fine art, paintings and such. They were busted together and sent to different prisons where Tony died of AIDS, I guessed. Danielle and I thought Carl turned tricks off the Internet for the money he had, but we had no proof. On our third day together, he had us drop him off in the middle of nowhere, because he did not want to hear us fight. His countenance was quiet and depressed, and he wouldn‚Äôt make eye contact.

Danielle and I came back from trying to score all day at around 630 to find Carl outside of the room waiting for us. He got four balloons as usual, but this time he only gave us one and kept three. Then he gave us 20 bucks and sent us to Wendy‚Äôs to get some dinner.

Carl lay on the floor sweaty and flaccid by the time we got back to the room. A few slaps to the face and yells of his name proved he had overdosed. Danielle shrieked and flapped her hands at her face in fear, while I ran to the bathroom and saturated a hand towel with water. When I rung it out over his face and the water hit him he came to.

‚ÄúHey, mother f\*\*\*er, we‚Äôre calling 911! You need to go to the hospital!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt take his attempt at suicide personally. It was his prerogative far as I saw it, but overdosing himself in the hotel room where we slept was unacceptable.

‚ÄúNo! No! No! Don‚Äôt call the ambulance. I‚Äôm okay. I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù He begged us not to call. I listened to him, for some reason. Soon after all of it, I regretted not robbing him for all his money and sending him overdosed to the hospital. We would have been gone with his electronics and money before he got out of the hospital.

We feared that he would asphyxiate, so we made him sit up against the corner of the room on his bed while we watched TV. The blankets were around him, and she and I must have given cues that I was nodding out with our conversation. His eyes were closed, but he was awake.

‚ÄúSee? Riley is nodding out. Why doesn‚Äôt he have to go to the hospital?‚Äù

‚ÄúShut the f\*\*\* up, Carl. Or we will call 911 to come get your overdosing a\*\*.‚Äù It was 1030.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fair. You are as high as I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut the f\*\*\* up, Carl!‚Äù

He was snoring at 130 when I went to sleep. The Hangover played mute on the TV. Danielle woke me up at 10.

‚ÄúRiley. Riley. Wake up. I think he‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not dead.‚Äù I opened my eyes and looked at him. I was not so sure.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs dead, bubby! He looks dead!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. He‚Äôs not dead. Let‚Äôs find a rinse before we check.‚Äù

We found the bottom half of a coke can on a shelf below the TV. It had a spot of brown goo on the edge with a gray, shriveled cotton in the middle. It was all that was left of the three balloons he did the day before. I wondered how he even managed to get that much tar into a syringe and inject it while we were at Wendy‚Äôs. I thought he must have skin-popped it. It would have been several injections of black sludge, and if he had hit a vein the first one would have put him out.

We washed the bottom of the coke can with water and even sucked it through his old cotton. It was not the clean thing to do, but we didn‚Äôt care. She peed on the toilet and kept telling me he was dead while I split the syringes of slightly colored water. I denied it one more time before I hit a vein in her arm and then my own.

I walked out first and went over to his bed. I focused on his mouth and the strand of drool hanging from his chin. It was dried out and stuck there, the consistency of hair sprayed spider web. When I put my hand on his shoulder to shake him awake, I said, ‚ÄúCarl!‚Äù But he rolled over, cold and stiff. His legs never unfolded or changed position. The dried-out stalactite of drool stood upside down in the air, and his head hung off the bed. His eyes belonged on ice at the super market. They may as well have been a pair of yellow, lumpy grapes for all the life that they had in them.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead.‚Äù Danielle cried. I pulled him off the bed onto the floor. It only took a second for me to consider what money he might have on him and reached into the pocket of his shorts to find a black leather wallet. There were 250 dollars, so I took the two big bills and left the 50.

Danielle called 911 like we should have the night before. She said the operator said to give him mouth to mouth. One look at his dead mouth and the thought of the stale air trapped in his lungs settled it in my mind that I was not giving him mouth to mouth.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not giving him mouth to mouth!‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, Riley! Just try! Is he cold?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot cold, but he‚Äôs not warm. If you want to give him mouth to mouth get over here and do it. Or they can come do it, but I AM NOT doing it!‚Äù

She talked into the phone. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not completely cold. Is that a good thing? Is there a chance he might live?‚Äù She asked in tears and then turned to me. ‚ÄúShe says to put your mouth on his mouth and breath.‚Äù

‚ÄúHang up!‚Äù

We gathered the syringes and cookers and balloons and threw the in the dumpster at the back of the parking lot. We stepped outside as the fire truck pulled up. They quickly gave up on trying to resuscitate Carl‚Äôs dead body. One squad car pulled up, then another, and one more. A cop put up the yellow tape around the room, and they separated Danielle and me, to question us. She spoke so I could hear her, to get our stories to match up. The black cop dressed in blues flirted with her. She flirted back and told him she was a stripper. As I wrote a statement on the hot hood of a running squad car in the sun, I wondered how many years I could get for it. Would these be my last minutes of freedom scribbling and nervous on the hood of a cop car?

An unmarked car pulled up with two detectives. They wore jackets, slacks and ties and had personality. They slicked their black hair back true to their Hispanic heritage. One of them talked to me about the Hornets and mentioned the Nuggets. Sickly scents of pomade and cologne mixed with fear to turn my stomach. His partner walked around and talked to the policemen before he walked up to me.

‚ÄúLook. We got an overdose to go to right after this, two blocks away. Another dead body. We don‚Äôt have time for all of this. Where are the syringes and cookers? You don‚Äôt think he overdosed on air, do you? No. We don‚Äôt either. Now, we understand, you and your girlfriend got scared and hid all the stuff. But we need some evidence of his drug use. We need some syringes for evidence, and we‚Äôll get you two on your way. I promise.‚Äù

They took me to the dumpster where we tossed the stuff, and made me climb in, but I couldn‚Äôt find it. There were several empty 20 oz. bottles from another room with syringes in them. We never put our syringes in bottles like that, but the detective seemed satisfied.

‚ÄúOK. Grab a few and give them to me.‚Äù

They took some pictures and got our written statements. Things wrapped up, and the coroner came. A hearse came to pick up the body. It was obvious that one of the two men working for the company with the hearse enjoyed his job, maybe too much. He had a black three-piece suit and a felt top hat on, with a gold chain to a watch in his breast pocket. He wore a monocle. I didn‚Äôt know hearses picked up overdosed bodies out of hotel rooms, but that‚Äôs what I saw that day.

When they finally took the yellow police tape down and released us from the scene, she jumped into my arms and wrapped her legs around my waist. We shouted in glee and relief and made out in front of the last two cops on the scene. It was over, and we were free. I still had the 200 hundred dollars.

The first thing we did was call Chivo and met one of his guys at a gas station. When his driver showed up, I told him what happened. It didn‚Äôt really matter to him. They wanted the money. At some point in the day, I spilled the last of our heroin out of a cooker onto my khaki pants. She was mad, so we went to Home Depot. I tried to steal a bunch of copper wire, but on the way out of the door, loss prevention drove me to the ground so hard the scab on my knee had fabric from my pants in it and turned it green. Lock up smelled better than the last one, and they let me out after three days for petit theft.

A week later, the coroner called to ask what I knew about Carl. I told him what Carl told me, maybe it was true, maybe not, but it‚Äôs what he said. His tone of voice seemed bewildered over the phone. Sometime after that, on our way to Danielle‚Äôs first night stripping again, a strange figure riding a scooter pulled up next to us. Danielle and I looked over at a 55-year-old lesbian in a black leather cap and vest, thick glasses, orang freckles and pale face. Her hair was red and grey and buzzed off. Could it be Carl? It looked exactly like him. We laughed about when the 911 operator had instructed us to give him mouth to mouth.

I never felt much about robbing the dead man, or the fact that the last words he heard before he died were me telling him to, ‚Äúshut the f\*\*\* up.‚Äù There was no time to feel bad about it, when spilled hits of heroin and three days in jail were so disappointing. The only thing I ever thought about it was that I should have robbed him when he was overdosed and called the paramedics. It would have been less trouble for us.

I'm fairly new to opiates and use sparingly but recently i came across a big oxycodone chlorhydrate pills stash dosed between 5mg to 20mg

I started using 1 month ago sticking to the following schedule by starting each week with 1-2 pills and gradually ramping up to the numbers written in the below table by the middle of each week.

Week 1 : 4/5 5mg 21PM-6AM
Week 2 : 10 5mg / 24H
Week 3 : 6 10mg /24H
Week 4 : 4 20mg pills / 24H



Week | Consumption | Period of use
----|-----------|-------------
1 | 5 5mg pills | 21PM-6AM
2 | 10 5mg pills | /24H
3 | 6 10mg pills | /24H
4 | 4 20mg pills| /24H



I am at the end of week 4.
I still have 2 5mg pills, and 13 pills of morphine sulphate extended release.

24H after last use i feel some depressions and loss of motivation symptoms, i worked all day in euphoria during 2 weeks so i can see why suddenly everything seems harder to do.

Is there an exit strategy for me by using what is left to my disposal or even getting some more secable 5mg pills to plan a tapering off.

I thought that at first using the xr sulphate to stave off withdrawals during days and gradually decrease to 5mg pills then cut in half until i'm a step of soberity. I also have weed and psychedelics at my disposal. 
I could incorparate LSD Microdose and occasional weed to counter the symptoms. I also exercise in short 30mn session every day to supplement the dopamine supply.

What do you think would fit the plan ?",1533479709.0

Feeling the withdrawals start kicking in.  It was a pretty normal night but half way down the free way I felt my stomach start rumbling and something start to creep out my asshole.  I was hoping it was just a fart and was trying desperately to hold it in.  There was so much pressure that started to build up down there and I was scared shitless.  

I knew I had to figure something out now before a shit volcano came out of me.  I took the next exit but in this part of town there was nothing.  nada.  But it was still very well urban.  There was no way I could even muster up the ability to take out my phone and find the nearest restroom.  It was that bad.

So I said ""Fuck it"".   I pulled into the next parking lot i saw, which was some type of bank I believe.  Drove into the parking spot and in record time I simultaneously opened my door, pulled down my pants, bent over, and literally exploded all over the bank parking lot.  I'm far from religious but I was praying to the great creator that security would not come (thankfully it didn't happen.  God that would've been extremely embarassing...)  The size of my pile looked like it belonged to a bovine.  It was crazy.  I'm also praying that they either don't see this pie or they think it's from some type of animal (which I highly doubt they'd think it would just be a squirrel or something) when they come in on Monday.  It's literally in front of the building ON one of the main parking spots.  Some employee can literally park and step out right onto this chocolate stew that will undoubtedly be cooking in 100 degree weather for over 36 hours.  I have a huge feeling they will look at the cameras and laugh at my dumbass and probably submit it to Youtube where I will be a laughing stock for a week.

So I didn't have any napkins or anything in my car and I was pissed.  Turns out there was a gas station right across the street.  I'm a dumbass.  Pulled up my pants and waddled over to the gas station to make sure my fresh shit ass doesn't touch my boxers and wiped myself off in the gas station bathroom.  I then got a soda, and of course the cashier tried asking me how my night's been.  ""shitty...""  and left.  15 minutes later I was high so that was cool.

Yes it was demoralizing but it felt ohhhhhhh so good when everything was said and done.

So I ended up doing 80mg of morphine orally and I didn‚Äôt actually feel anything apart from itchy and sweaty. 


My friend threw up once a while after doing 40mg and didn‚Äôt do anymore, I felt nothing 150 minutes after the first 40mg dose so I did 40mg more, it got to around 3 in the morning and we decided to go to bed feeling a bit disappointed.
As I was about to brush my teeth my mouth started watering like crazy and I felt really sick, I ran down stairs to get the sick bowl and threw up a lot, felt a little bit better but I think throwing up a bit more would have done the trick.


Woke up this morning with a terrible headache and threw up some more, took some painkillers and now I‚Äôm feeling better.


So I think considering I‚Äôm 17, it‚Äôs probably best that I don‚Äôt do any more opiates and just pretend that my body reacts badly with them as this is probably better than trying more and possibly getting addicted.

They should be smart enough to know that when someone goes into opiate withdrawal they get desperate and they go try to cop on the street or in the worst case scenario attempt suicide.

If the government truly cared about helping addicts and improving our current situation. They would make medication assisted therapy more accessible. They would allow maintenance drugs like methadone and suboxone to be prescribed by PCPs like other countries have done with great success. They would divert money from our bloated military budget and invest in community based addiction services. They would attempt to fix our deeply flawed for profit health care system.

He‚Äôs a monster. I hate him, and I‚Äôm not going to read the rest of this crap either.‚Äù

The payment for the eyeball was a half-ounce of the best heroin in town. I couldn‚Äôt turn that down. He was going to get his eyeball removed from him one way or another. It didn‚Äôt matter. If I didn‚Äôt do it, someone else would. Besides, there were promises made during the negotiations of the deal that Bug was in fact a very bad guy who had done some very bad things, to kids even. His boyish kimono wearing lover on the bed lent credibility to that idea.

As to accusations of me being a monster? I am. There‚Äôs no doubt. I would never deny that. They call me Boom Boom, and that‚Äôs not for nothing. And you‚Äôd be totally justified if you quit reading right now. I think the thing to do when writing is show yourself to be human and create some sort of empathy between yourself and the reader before dropping bombs of over-the-top and borderline unrealistic scenes of mindless violence on them. I think if you keep reading, though, you will appreciate the things I have to say and the story I have to tell.

So anyway, I had moved the eyeball from my pocket into an empty box of chocolate milk I found on a stoop after Rufus got hemmed up. It was a better container for the eye. Otherwise, it might have gotten crushed in my pocket and squeezed out whatever squeezes out of eyeballs when they get crushed in people‚Äôs pockets. I imagined clear jelly. I carried the carton in my hand as I walked and shook it from time to time, partly to make sure it was still in there and partly because I was fascinated by the sounds it made.

The sign above the shop said THE LAND OF ENCHANTMENT. That‚Äôs the nickname for the state of New Mexico, where Jimbo was supposedly from. I walked in. As usual, a white sage smudge stick smoldered on the counter by the register where Jimbo leaned on his elbows. The smoke always burned my eyes. Jimbo was always watching a box TV and trying to fix the antenna.

He jumped up and walked to meet me in the middle of the shop.

‚ÄúYou got it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Right here.‚Äù

Off in the corner his lover, Finnish Fin, sat on a beanbag chair red eyed and smoking a joint. He was fat and feminine but very nice. He smiled and held his hand out to say hello to me. At his feet lay two obese dalmatians. Their names were Sasha and Sabrina. They could barely walk.

‚ÄúGood! Good!‚Äù Jimbo said rubbing his hands. At that moment, my attention turned to the goiter on the side of his neck. It was always hard not to look at it, and as he opened the top of the carton to see into it, he asked me, ‚ÄúAre you looking at my goiter again?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure am, Jimbo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, does it look any different?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah. Maybe like it‚Äôs hardening in some spots. Calcifying or whatever the hell it is goiters do.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo bad.‚Äù He said. He was completely engrossed with the task at hand.

Jimbo walked back behind the counter and pulled a plate out. He dumped the contents of the carton out, and apparently, there had been more chocolate milk in it than I‚Äôd thought. The eyeball plopped out in the middle of the shallow puddle with a wet smack. A translucent floatie moved around in the brown liquid next to it. The whole scene reminded me of every time I‚Äôd ever cracked an egg to scramble.

‚ÄúBoss man will be happy about this one! Fin, give it to him.‚Äù

The blond, pale skinned man on the bean bag chair reached into his coat pocket and produced several packages wrapped in butcher paper. He fumbled through them and threw one up in the air to me. I peeled the tape off and unrolled it. There was another layer of tinfoil but under that was a clear sandwich baggie holding the brown powder about thick around as a cigar. I held the package to my nose and inhaled. It smelled sort of like vinegar, but the best way to say what it smelled like is that it smelled like heroin. You know like when people eat something and say it tastes like chicken, but chicken is what really tastes like chicken. The weight in my hand smelled like heroin, good heroin. I was excited and said,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of works!‚Äù

‚ÄúHere, Boom Boom.‚Äù Fin stood up and pulled open a drawer. He produced a syringe and a cooker that even had the twist ties from the needle exchange and one of those blue water droppers. ‚ÄúUse the closet back here. The windows, you know?‚Äù He gestured towards the shop‚Äôs large windows. ‚ÄúOh ya, Boom Boom, be careful. That‚Äôs good stuff.‚Äù

I walked to the closet and found a bucket. I turned it over, rolled up my sleeve and sat down to fix it up. *You missed it, Rufus*. I thought. *Hopefully, I still have some when you get out.*",1533445778.0

From kind folk... thanks a lot Oklahoma.,"Oklahoma recently passed a bill that the government SWEARS will take care of the opioid crisis. One thing they're doing is controlling pain management. Every patient cannot be prescribed more than 90mg of morphine a day. So if someone is prescribed 2 40 oxymorphone and 3 oxy 10s (for breakthrough pain) a day , they have to be cut down to one oxymorphone. because that's the equivalent. And it has to happen fast. Patients are already starting to withdrawal and feel desperate. Doctors want to ween their patients slowly and as painless as possible but doctors are also trying to dodge getting sued by the state for ""over prescribing"". But some of these patients have major chronic pain and have had it for 5, 10, 20, 30 etc years and will continue with this pain. If you read about oxymorphone, it is an opioid made for those people who have been in pain management for years and the other meds have slowly stopped effecting them. My mother is one of those people. Going on 30 years and she's now in so much pain. She won't take more than prescribed but cutting down to less than half of her daily dose is just cruel. I could see this leading to more heroin ODs. If the government is set on doing this, give the doctors time to ween their patients before you start threatening to sue them. This is heartbreaking to see. And I wish my mom would let me try to find her extra so she could be comfortable but she's stubborn and a strict law abiding citizen. She won't take anything that isn't hers. What should I do? I don't know how to help her. I'm an addict and in sub treatment. I would say she could just give up and start getting off of it but she's fatally ill and in a lot of pain. So that's a no go. I wish Mary Fallin could come to my house and experience what my mom is going through. Maybe then her and her group of buttheads could get a better picture of what they're actually doing and maybe figure out what they need to do.",1533438474.0

I'm on 130 mg of methadone. What's going on?,"First of all, before I was on methadone, this literally NEVER ever happened.

Even when I was on a lowish to mid range dose (for me) of methadone it never happened.

So now I'm on 130mg.

I bought some dope from a guy and shot my usual dose (like .5 gram) and immediately I had the worst most suicide-inducing headache ever.

I suffer from SEVERE chronic pain. This was LITERALLY the worst fucking pain I've ever been in by far. I couldn't even think enough to operate my phone. I barely had the ability to swallow a fistful of xanax and ibuprofen to try to stop it. If my condo would have been on the top floor I would have thrown myself off without hesitation (and no, I'm not suicidal).

Here's what happened.

After the shot, I got no rush, just an extremely irritating reaction feeling. Then I slowly felt my heartbeat start to crawl upwards towards my head. The beating then landed in the back of my head and this super-migraine-on-steroids started to beat exactly in rhythm with my heart. It felt like there was massive pressure in my skull and that an artery in my brain was about to explode, beating in perfect unison with my heart. Everytime my heart made a beat, the pressure caused an extreme wave of incapacitating pain. Imagine everytime your heart beat, the pressure in the back of your head shot up to 10,000 psi and caused the most torturous pain imaginable. It was absolutely dreadful.

Eventually after 30 minutes of literally bashing my head into a wall and screaming into a pillow like a wild animal, it began to subside.

I immediately texted this dealer, told him what happened, and said there must be something in his cut that is causing this.

He said it hadn't happened to anyone else including him.

I figured he was full of shit and never bought from him again.

Well, it turns out he was right.

Long story short, everytime I would do even a slightly moderate amount of any dope, from any source, IV, this would happen again.

The thing is, I could snort as much as I wanted and this wouldn't happen.

I could even IV as much as I want - so long as I didn't do too much in one shot - and this wouldn't happen.

It only happens when I IV above a certain amount in a single shot.

So yeah, I figured it was my methadone dose and I decided to do only very small shots for 3 days (about 72 hours) until the methadone was out of my system (or at least most of it, I hope).

So after 72 hours after last taking my 130mg of methadone, I doubled my h dose and took a dose that would normally have caused a headache, and it didn't.

I was too afraid to push the dose any higher than that, and I had to go back to the clinic the next day anyway, and would have no choice but to dose methadone.

So yeah, in conclusion, sorry about the long essay lol.

Basically, on my current 130mg dose of methadone, if I shoot even a slightly too large small shot of IV heroin all at once in the same shot, I get literally the worst migraine headache imaginable that would make anyone want to eat a 12 gauge. If I wait about 3 days, I can do a larger shot, but I haven't tried doing anything close to my regular dose.

By the way, as far as my tolerance goes, it's massive. As long as I spread out the doses, I avoid the headache, and have done well over a gram of fire IV and was still fully awake.

So anyways. What I was wondering is.

What do you think is going on? Has anyone ever had an experience like this, with or without methadone and/or any other drug(s)?

If you were in my situation, hypothetically, how long would you wait after last dosing methadone before taking h? After the methadone break, how much h would you do relative to the last h dose that did not cause a headache? Basically how long would you wait after the methadone and how slow would you taper the h dose up and at what dose would you no longer increase it?

Thank you for reading this everyone. I truly appreciate it.

## Danielle PART 2 

## 

## Violent and otherwise destructive behavior was a defense mechanism, necessary to maintain a life of ruthless drug addiction in the streets. It was the unsurprising side effect of a cold and calloused heart, which had no room for things like sentimentality or love. Those things make a person weak and vulnerable in a world where dogs eat dogs, and even mothers eat their children. That may sound extreme, but that is how it was to me. That is how I saw it. If I would sell myself for drugs, plunge a blade into my stomach, steal my grandmother‚Äôs jewelry or subject myself to the harsh reality of the streets day in and day out, what would stop me from doing the same to you? Nothing.

## We told everyone we were in love, but love was impossible for people like us. What we really had were attempts to fill our lives‚Äô emotional voids with each other and chemical imbalances in our brains that manifested themselves as romantic fantasy. In a very short time we became very close. Probably because we spent every second of every day together, and every day tried us.

## Somewhere in her head, I was half baby and half bunny like her beloved Bunny O‚ÄôReilly from childhood. Her mom had inadvertently programmed her to love that name, and her father programmed her to love men that were no good to her, even though he was pretty good to her when I knew her. I fit the bill. Half bunny and half baby, she called me bubby when I was capable of compassion, but when I had heroin eyes and the hiccups she just called me Clyde.

‚ÄúHey Clyde! How come you never call me Bonnie?‚Äù

‚ÄúCuz your name ain‚Äôt Bonnie!‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what? A Clyde ain‚Äôt nothing without a Bonnie. Just like you ain‚Äôt nothing without me. You‚Äôre my Clyde. I want to be your Bonnie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are my Bonnie, baby! But, that ain‚Äôt your name. You know how I am. It‚Äôs like you wanting me to speak Spanish to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah! I want you to call me Bonnie, and I want you to speak Spanish to me!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to do? Have conversations with myself? You can‚Äôt even understand it. That‚Äôs weird. Like calling you Bonnie.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what? Call me Bonnie, Clyde! Speak Spanish to me! It‚Äôs sexy!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah right! You‚Äôre name ain‚Äôt Bonnie, and you don‚Äôt speak Spanish! Now, drop it!‚Äù

The trajectory and momentum of my life scared people before she came around, but now it was a 20-pound cannon ball ripping through the air about to smash anyone and anything that got in its way, even her. Instead of one, now a couple of drug dealers wanted to kill me. Most junkies wanted to beat me up, and at least one cop promised to send me to prison the next time she found me. But, the real reason we left town was that the heroin was no good since Vanessa and Smokey got busted, and Danielle said she could make big bucks stripping in the City.

Eight miles north of town, heading to Colorado, a friend of ours called me up and asked if we could score for a kid who was new to town at the homeless shelter. We came over. The kid sniffled and his eyes watered when he yawned. He was sick for sure, so we said we would pick up from Joe and be right back. But we drove to the city after we scored from Joe. Our friend called to tell us that we were disgusting pieces of trash, and he was right. We departed in the grainy black and white of a 1930s movie house featuring Bela Lugosi as Dracula. We were some mad scientist‚Äôs undead creatures fleeing to the hills from an angry mob of town folk with their pitchforks and torches.

That first week in the city is mostly a blur. Somehow, we got a hold of some speed and slunk up and down the street in the Camry, suspicious as they get, at all hours of the morning, but the cops never bothered us for it. At a 24-hour donut shop, we took the two dollars and 39 cents out of the tip jar. It must have been early in the month when her SSI check came in, because we were in and out of adult novelty shops across the city buying all kinds of stuff and even had a hotel room. We made connections with new dealers, and let some homeless guy videotape us having sex in a hotel room one night. I stole a pair of stilettos for her, but there was something we had to take care of before she could start stripping.

Not long before we left town I missed an injection and deposited the warm, dirt water of a rinse into the muscle of her forearm. She was thin. Her veins rolled a lot, and she moved around when I dug in her arm trying to register blood. The miss turned into an abscess the size of a golf ball, so we took matters into our own hands in a hotel room.

We stole a pack of shaving razors, a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, some gauze and tape. I broke the thin blade out of one of the shavers and snapped it in half. In the poorly lit bathroom she stood in the tub, while I knelt on the floor outside of it. Danielle shook, and her lips curled in distress. With her right wrist in my left hand I looked at her and said with a smile,

‚ÄúNow baby, I know that I look like one, but I feel like I should tell you that I‚Äôm not actually a doctor.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up! It‚Äôs not funny! Now hurry up!‚Äù

I pushed the sharp side of the blade into the thin, yellowed skin on the head of her abscess. A snake of black blood and green puss slithered down her arm and thudded in clumps on the floor by the drain. She recoiled, but I held her wrist and pulled her back.

‚ÄúNow, we have to squeeze it.‚Äù I pinched her flesh on either side of the bleeding wound and squeezed it. More blood and puss oozed out. Her body shuddered, and she groaned curse words. We were high on heroin, but it didn‚Äôt make much difference for her. It was painful. I poked a hole into the top of the bottle of peroxide and sprayed a jet of the fluid into her wound. It fizzed and foamed on the blood.

‚ÄúOkay. That should be good.‚Äù We wrapped it in gauze and taped it up and went to sleep.

The next night we went up to The Bus Stop to get her job at the strip club back. After 15 minutes of waiting in the car, she walked out fuming and cursing back at one of the bouncers, and he screamed from across the parking lot that she was a junkie whore. They did not want her back with a bandage on her arm like that. So we headed back home.

I wasn‚Äôt afraid of the death threats there, because if there was anything I knew about back home, it was that no one‚Äôs word was worth much. The people who wanted to kill me would have to find me first, and even if they did, they would have to deal with me when they did. I‚Äôm not saying that they weren‚Äôt dangerous people. They were, but what I am saying is that when it came down to it, so was I.

30 minutes out of the city a blizzard blinded us, and snow covered the interstate. The radio played. The heater warmed the car. She sat naked in the passenger seat, and my hand rested between her legs when the car spun off the road. The car did a few 360s on the highway, before we slid down the embankment of the median. In two minutes a cop came to help us, so she put on a jacket and rolled down the window. He told us to get off the road once he helped us get back onto it. We stopped at the rest stop a few miles up the highway and spent the night.

When we woke up, it was light and the roads were safe. I found the ten-dollar bag of heroin we lost under the seat the night before and split it with her. It was the last of what we bought for a guy that sent us 100 dollars from home a few days before. He thought we would bring him some back some heroin from the city, but now it was all gone.

‚ÄúWhat do you think, baby? It‚Äôs a four-hour ride back home, and the dope‚Äôs no good there.‚Äù

Plants like poppies don't have any nutritional value to anything but bugs. 


The amount of opiates on one poppy isn't enough to kill something like a human but more then enough to kill bugs, a defense that kept them safe for a while. That's why when you slit them that milky substance mostly comprised of morphine will slowly ooze out of the hole.


Of course animals found them then eventually humans who took them to another level after they discovered a non lethal dose is fucking awesome but I love the fact the whole reason it exists is a defense against predators.",1533430508.0

## 

## 

## Danielle PART 1 

## 

## 

## The scars on my neck belong to her. Two cigarette burns, perfectly round and white, sit two inches below my ears where Frankenstein‚Äôs creature had his bolts. I see them every time I shave, and they remind me of hard days with my girl. Her name was Danielle, but I just called her baby.

## In the middle of our arguments we screamed in one another‚Äôs faces. Sometimes, I cleared my throat and hawked phlegm into her eyes, and she spat back into mine. We tried to blow each other away with the spray of verbal buckshot until there was nothing left of us. Ten minutes later we made love on the bed or the back seat of the Camry and found something or someone to rob. It was a game we played, and it was killing both of us.

The first time I met her, her boyfriend lay on the floor of my apartment trembling and bleeding through his pants. My drug dealers pulled him out of her Camry on the south side of town and stabbed him in the knee for trying to go around me and deal with them directly. It didn‚Äôt work out for him, thus the crying and bleeding on my floor.

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you Riley?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. You must be Danielle.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure am.‚Äù She dropped his head to put her hand out.

‚ÄúGood to finally meet you.‚Äù I smiled and pinched her fingers.

I was seeing a different girl at the time, a 19-year-old red head who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over hours before she left her house, but that morning in my apartment, the look in Danielle‚Äôs eye told me it was only a matter of time before we got together. Never mind Mike and the red head.

Danielle and Mike used to come over every day before three to laugh at me for nodding out and looking like Teen Wolf. She always tried to get alone with me, but we didn‚Äôt hook up until after Mike started beating her again and I spent two weeks locked up, promising myself and everyone else that I would never do heroin again.

Mike took the battery out of her car and held her against her will in a trailer on the Mesa while I sat in jail. Then he passed out one afternoon after he put the battery back in, and she made her escape. Half an hour later, I called her from the payphone outside of the jail, and our reign of terror began.

I should tell you that this is the part of the story where you might want to stop reading. On the next page or so, I‚Äôm going to sell a guy a bag of dirt for 40 dollars and turn his face into hamburger meat before I hold him hostage in his bedroom for the night. My girlfriend will beg me to infect her with the Hepatitis C virus, and I will try. A few pages after that, I will rob a dead man, so if you‚Äôre not with all that or don‚Äôt understand that we were in a bad way, this is a good time to stop reading.

One of the only three heroin dealers in town fronted us packages of dope, and we came back with the money every night. He fronted us more, and we returned with more cash. Then he gave us a half-ounce, but we never came back. He offered anyone in town a 50-dollar bag for our whereabouts and left promises to murder me on her voicemail. We ripped off other junkies. They hated us. We stole merchandise and food from businesses. The owners and employees hated us. Several cops in town knew that I was driving the Camry and that I had a girlfriend. They hated us too, but we hated each other most of all.

Danielle had a monthly prescription for 90 Colonopin and a SSI check. Both were available on the first of the month, and we shot so much dope and took so many pills the first week of the month that our only friend quit hanging out with us. When her orange pill bottle quit rattling and the check was spent, anxiety wrought havoc. More than once she left me at the gas station and freezing at three in the morning while I was buying cigarettes and drove by a few times, screaming and giving me the finger for no reason. Later in the night we would go to the ER looking for meds.

Her Camry became our home. We cleaned out the ashtray at the casino several times a day and listened to Depeche Mode and Seminole Wind by John Anderson. Our diet consisted entirely of Wendy‚Äôs spicy chicken nuggets and Baja Blast. She made me give her a shot of dope visibly mixed with my own blood to intentionally contract Hepatitis C. That way I could no longer use contamination as an excuse for why I wouldn‚Äôt share a hit or a rinse with her. One afternoon I pulled over on the side of the highway and proposed to her with her own wooden ring. She said yes and we made out like two outlaws in love.

A lot of guys liked her. One of them lived in a nice apartment his parents paid for. His name was Justin. Now I forget what he said, but it made me mad. Then he gave us 40 bucks to go score, so she and I split it between us and put dirt in his bag. He called to complain, but we quit answering the phone. Later that night, I decided we should sleep at his place, so I parked in his parking lot and told her,

‚ÄúGet all of our blankets and meet me at the front door, baby.‚Äù

As I walked through the cobblestone courtyard of the adobe apartment complex, I wondered how mad he was and thought of what I was about to do. I fingered the baggie in my pocket. At his front door breath billowed out of my mouth, and the raps of my knuckles on his door bit cold into my bones. I put my hand back into my pocket and waited. The television played on the other side of the door. He opened it, but the chain only allowed a few inches.

‚ÄúWho is that? Riley? What do you want? I ought to mess you up for selling me dirt! Get out of here!‚Äù The interior light of his apartment poured out yellow through the crack in the door. It looked warm and comfortable.

‚ÄúI know. I know. Listen. I got something here, to make up for it.‚Äù I moved my arm and hand in my pocket, to indicate it was in my pocket. ‚ÄúOpen up, so I can show you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù The door closed momentarily while the chain latch came off. The knob turned. I grabbed it and lodged myself in the doorframe so he couldn‚Äôt close it. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? You can‚Äôt stay here! Why does she have blankets? Dude, what the f\*\*\*? Seriously?‚Äù A pile of blankets with Danielle‚Äôs legs bounced through the courtyard towards us. I made sure she got in before I let him shut the door.

She threw the blankets on the shag rug in front of his TV. He whined in the kitchen and flapped his arms, but we disregarded him until we had settled in and felt ready to address him. His accusations were mostly accurate, except when he said we didn‚Äôt have any heroin. We did, but not for him.

After she and I situated things, I showed him the 20-dollar bag we had. It was enough to shut him up, because we promised to share. We told him we would split it three ways, but in the bathroom, she and I split it down the middle. Afterwards, we rinsed the spoon and cotton filter a few more times, until all that was left was dirt and ash in the spoon. Then we sucked it up and came out of the bathroom to give it to him. He happily took the syringe full of dirty water and never accused us of anything until we hid ourselves in the bathroom again.

Danielle had her pants down, and I sat on the toilet applying cortisone cream to a patch of eczema on her rear end and thigh. She leaned over the sink. The door was locked while I took care of my baby.

‚ÄúOpen up. I know you‚Äôre in there doing more! Open up! You pieces of s\*\*\*!‚Äù The door shook as he pounded. ‚ÄúOpen up! Open the f\*\*\*ing door!‚Äù The door hit her in the head when he kicked it in.

My hands ripped the cedar towel rack out of the wall, before I could think. I beat him back out of the bathroom and side-to-side, across the living room with the wooden rod. A symphony of rage blared out of me and into my opponent. I was the impassioned composer of a brutal work, wildly conducting an orchestra of fingers, fists and arms. He tripped and fell backwards over his coffee table and couch.

My shirt was off and sweat was dripping when I threw the rod at his face. He could have it, because I owned him now. I leapt onto his chest for the crescendo of my opus and went to work. I pinned his arms under my legs. Bare knuckles bloodied themselves on his cheeks, and his face turned side to side with each punch. Snot and blood leaked from his mouth and nose, and he squealed as I stopped to catch my breath.

‚ÄúPlease, stop! Please! Please!‚Äù My teeth bit into my bottom lip. I looked at him for a second with my fist cocked back, before I tried to drive it through the back of his skull. His face was swollen and discolored and bloody.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you get for messing with my girl.‚Äù I thought and jumped up to grab the biggest butcher knife in the kitchen. About 10 inches of blade shined in the living room light.

‚ÄúI will f***ing kill you! You piece of s***! I will f***ing gut you! You f***ing hear me?‚Äù The F word constituted about one of every ten of my words back then! ‚ÄúGet in your room and give me your cell phone! You can come out in the morning, when she and I are done. You hear me, you f***ing piece of s***? Come out of the room, and I will stick this f***ing knife in your throat! Your guts will be all over this f***ing floor! You f\*\*\*ing hear me?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt say anything. He gave me his phone and held his face as he walked into his room. People around town always told me that he was a fighter. Supposedly he stood up to Diablo once and even ‚Äúgave him a run for his money.‚Äù Everyone always said he was tough, but not that night.

Danielle and I made a bed on the floor out of our blankets. She pulled up some pornography on his phone. Whatever meth we did the day before was too strong and the heroin was too weak to get us to sleep, so we had sex on and off throughout the night. Sometimes, I smoked cigarettes and tried to write poetry on pieces of cardboard box. She played dress up with some clothes that she had brought in. Later in the night she said something that hurt my feelings, so I used the scissors in my hand to stab myself in the leg a few times, but as daylight broke there was forgiveness and more sex. We defiled his toothbrush before we left, but I can‚Äôt remember why.",1533424728.0

It's shitty only being able to get off with the help of someone. I'll just keep studying him and working on getting these veins to pop. 

My veins are hard to see from me being on the chubby side. I'm successfully getting into shape, I stay hydrated and take warm showers, but they stay hidden. 
They're easy to find by feeling, and my boyfriend can hit them without fail, but I basically turn myself into a pincushion when I'm by myself. Ive tried all over arms and hands, at different angles, and can't see what I'm doing wrong. I'll think I'm in a vein, but can't register. I must be getting the angles wrong? I even try the ones on my hands and wrists that are visible. 

What have people found helpful when struggling to hit a vein that they know is there? 

This wouldn't be so frustrating if I could get anything out of just plugging it when I can't bang it. But when I plug, even when I'm empty, I get a fraction (if anything) of what I know I should get. 
I know I'm plugging correctly, I just don't get much out of it. 

anyone else out there not able to get a lot out of plugging?

- do not waste your time or breath trying to find loopholes around the rules, do not try to be sly or discrete wile blatantly breaking the rule that will literally cause our sub to go down. the mods are not stupid, we know what you are doing. and personally i have zero patience for people trying to pull this shit here. if you try me you will find yourself banned very quickly. doing this just says you have no damn respect for r/opiates, its members, or its moderators.

I'm here cause I'm sad about something. I'm just sick of people judging me for being in pain management at 20.im always treated like a second class citizen by any medical professional (except my doctor and chiropractor because they understand).what I'm asking is at what age do people accept that you have pain and treat you like a human. I don't know where people got the idea that pain discriminates by age. I'm slowly getting sick of being harrassed when i pick up my script and treated like a drug seeker when I go to hospital.

And this might read as a little too personal, but milk of magnesia is a damn godsend for when you're.....plugged up. I dont personally use as heavy as a lot of you. But I do eat kratom a lot. And it can really plug me up sometimes. Just take a little more than a recommended dose of the milk, with a tall glass of water or two, and it is guaranteed to clean you out. Be advised it can get kinda messy. As most of what comes out is straight liquid. But hey, beggars cant be choosers right? It's better than trying to push out what feels like a tree limb. Lol like I said, sorry if this is a little graphic, but I've been there guys. Before I knew about the milk I've actually had to use a lubricant enema, and let me tell you that was not pleasant.

Dead simple. Major car accident at 17, painkillers all her life, gets cut off lately because politics and doctor shopping, tons of weed always, and a surprisingly large alcohol intake with the painkillers. Multiple stomach surgeries from painkillers (and alcohol...and APAP because she gets pills from overseas and swallows anything she can get her hands on...). I suffered a major spinal injury roughly 8 years ago and 2 years ago was put on pain meds. This was the start of my problems, as she coached me and told me exactly what to say to get ""what I needed"". When I couldn't handle the meds and wasn't getting better I started giving her some of my meds. It's a really long and complex story but she manipulated me for a year and a half and lied and told me so much bullshit and eventually I was pulled off my meds for weed. This was a good thing because I was fucking done with the meds. And then my mom told me to stop smoking and go back to get the pills. I knew what was happening at that point. She was using me for drugs. Cut to a suicidal cold turkey and them taking the rest of my meds. She adopted the mentality that ""if she paid for it it's hers"" which is just stupid.      
      
Over a year and a half later every single pill is gone, or ""in a safety deposit box"" according to my brother who goes as far as bringing pills back from Europe for her twice now and saying nothing as she takes mine and the dogs meds without a single recourse. And what's more I found out she was totally getting scripts when I was giving her my pills. So many red flags my entire life, it's unreal. She is, and has been, a raging polysubstance addict for her whole life as far as I can gather.                
           
Cut to today.        
       
An explosive argument took place when yet another one of my scripts which my mom ""took away from me because I was suicidal"" happened to just ""disappear"" (which is script #8 which is never to been seen again), and suddenly after calling my mom out for stealing my meds, both of my brothers started backing me into a corner and screaming to get in my room.       
       
It was like a fucking movie. They all started approaching from all sides as my mom stood there in her doorway looking on, backing up their threats of physical violence. They both started telling me to shut the fuck up and get back in my room and they were clearly intimidating me as they stared me down with all the daddy issues they could muster.               
         
You see, my father was a bipolar maniac, and he accused my mother of being a drug addict. And we got the bad man out of the household leaving just my prestine and flawless mother who never did anything wrong in her life and totally isn't exactly like our father in a manipulative, compulsive lying, and narcissistic controlling manner!         
       
And the best part, if my brothers beat the shit out of me for calling her a drug addict, they didn't actually do anything wrong, and they can take their daddy/anger issues out and feel like a big man all at once!        
         
 
I stood in the doorway looking down the little brother who hasn't outright assaulted me yet, just kicked a chair out from under me with the force of a thousand daddy issues, while my older brother was standing at the top of the stairs telling me to shut the fuck up as I ranted and raved about my junkie fucking mother who keeps stealing my medications for 2 fucking years now.        
        
I said to my little brother ""what are you going to do, fucking hit my like he did?"" Referring to the fact that my older brother assaulted me and chased me around the house exactly one year ago for the exact same situation, except last time it was 2 bottles of muscle relaxers which she gobbled in a month (strong ones too...and she drank nearly every day. I don't know how it took my so long to put the pieces together).       
       
As he (older brother a year ago) pushed me back through the hallway he screamed with even daddier issues ""I. WILL. ALWAYS. DEFEND. HER. NO. MATTER. WHAT."" Then backed me into my room and started throwing my shit  against the wall like a fucking anger issue poster child as he intimidated me for a half  hour. This culminated in him grabbing me me by my collar of my hoodie as I tried to run past him and  him extremely forcefully yanking me around a corner of my doorframe. He left large red marks on my neck which I photographed. I have a fucking spinal injury, documented well, no doubt by doctors, but my mother has them all convinced I'm just exaggerating for drugs. How ironic. And funnily enough, she was 1000% supportive until I called her a drug addict. She turned on a dime from supporting me and understanding my disability to completely trying to slander me and set me up for failure in any way possible. Because if I fuck up she can say ""You pick up!"" If I fail a class, even though I know I needed to be hospitalized 6 months prior to the semester starting and me having ample time to withdraw, ""you fail classes!"". I had a temp job which ended over the summer, so now it's ""you lose jobs!"". It gets more manipulative, she tells me everyone thinks I'm going to fail and that every single thing I accomplished is because of her and all my failures are completely my own. Sigh.            
         
So being yanked around a corner was unbelievable pain to say the least, and they knew that. A month of my life was spent bedridden for that fucking abusive piece of shit. I have not spoken a single word to my older brother since this incident, and immediately after he got violent I told him he was an abusive piece of shit over and over and outright accused him of being abusive to his girlfriend (which there are MANY red flags to say the least). This is where it gets juicy.      
      
(Again, still the a year ago incident). My older brother came back 20 minutes later outside my door crying about how ""you were suicidal (a fucking year prior to this assault) and nobody knew what to do"". I immediately called him out because he was the worst fake cryer I've ever heard (and he's legit a fucking actor so, yeah...sad), and told him to fuck off and go sort out his daddy issues.         
           
(Flashing forward to today).       
     
My older brother said ""if you don't shut the fuck up I will assault you again"". I didn't feel like pulling the cop card, because at this point I don't have any illegal drugs, and I'm sure they assumed I did, but it would be the final nail in the coffin and officially burn the bridge. Last year when I threatened to call the cops on my physically abusive brother I had weed so of course I didn't. Now it's only mom with the illegal drugs. If I called the cops at very least she's going to jail for my scripts and a shitton of weed and pills. And my brother would go too if I showed them the video which I've now setup on a security camera so I won't miss it this time. If they lay a fucking hand on me I'm calling the cops. And my brother will go to jail like the physically abusive piece of shit he is.              
         
I don't even know how to respond. I packed all my shit and I'm leaving as soon as humanly possible on a Trailways bus and staying in a motel/hotel until college starts back up in less than a month. I don't know how I'm dealing with the money, but that's the only thing. It's all set. Fuck this fucked up junkie apologist household.      
        
Fun fact, my little brother goes to the same college, so that'll be fun. I hate him and all of his stupid fucking friends and I can't wait to never talk to him ever again. He just screamed through the door that I'm a ""wannabe cripple"" so that's just the best start to a semester I could ask for! Glad he takes mommy's word as gospel.            
       
I'm more mentally together than any of those fucked up people. They're all completely under my mom's spell and will buy anything she says. So when I became ""not actually disabled and actually just a junkie piece of shit who wants to call mom a junkie so he can get away with taking a ton of drugs"", it became fact in their eyes. And they can treat me like shit, because now I'm the bad man who needs to be removed to Mommy can do all the drugs and have no one say shit about it. I don't know how you can defend someone who drinks on pills as the rule, not the exception. Who steals prescriptions, who does anything to get pain meds, who has been unemployed effectively for decades, who is a manipulative piece of shit junkie bitch who just needs to fucking overdose already.

Arnold had to cut me off one month when I had ‚Äúcome undone‚Äù a bit and he knew where I was headed. He always kept such a close eye on my use. I think it was because he felt guilty for being my source. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to sell or trade my oxys for a while. I need to take them more now I think.‚Äù I got a sick feeling in my gut. ‚ÄúWell, I understand that man. Does that mean you don‚Äôt have any extra right now you can toss me?‚Äù His face softened. He had a hard time telling me no. ‚ÄúI only have four. I have these alprazalom though. I read on the computer the other day it helps people get clean from pain pills. You can take a few and see what you think.‚Äù 

I was familiar with the term Xanax but not really sure what the drugs did. I liked opiates. Never had any reason to try other things once I found my love. ‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôll take a few and see how I fare.‚Äù I pocketed like twenty blue footballs and my four oxy tens. Purple I think they might‚Äôve been? It‚Äôs been so long since I thought about anything before an OC 30. Anyway, I start my next week out knowing I had to get clean again. Shit. 

Four days had passed when I finally got out of that benzo fog. Those alprazalom mother fuckers caused me to wreck my step moms car, get arrested and bailed out of jails for only possession of marijuana because thankfully I had run out of pills. My friend named Dawn showed up to the little one horse county jail I was sitting outside of. ‚ÄúTake me to Arnold‚Äôs.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay girl, you got it. I‚Äôm not judging you at all. I know you‚Äôre going through some shit but I got your back. You can use my dads truck since you fucked up your step moms car last night. Omg have you even talked to them yet?!‚Äù 

Man Dawn was such a great friend. We had only been friends for a few months but she just loved me and my recklessness. She had a few kids and a lot of help from her family. Her old man got killed on a drilling rig so she was set for life. She was so good to me the year I spent in the Alps. I still can‚Äôt believe she is still my friend. ‚ÄúHey let‚Äôs stop and get Chinese on the way to Arnold‚Äôs yeah? I‚Äôm starving girl and I‚Äôm sure you are too.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSure babe, sounds great. I‚Äôm not hungry at all but let me buy your lunch for coming and getting my ass.‚Äù  

I sheepishly slide out of Dawn‚Äôs suburban and go up to the camera I had just installed to show my stupid face. I went inside. Arnold had posted my bond the night before but I had to stay there because he couldn‚Äôt drive to come get me. My own father declined to come get me the forty minutes away from his home and young blonde wife. ‚ÄúWhat kind of bird doesn‚Äôt fly?‚Äù I had a dumb and sad look on my face. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fucking know Arnold. What kind?‚Äù ‚ÄúA jailbird.‚Äù He was smiling at me when I glanced up from my formidable sadness. ‚ÄúFuck. You. Arnold.‚Äù 

We sit and smoke a joint and discuss the fact that it‚Äôs because I was cute was the reason Barney over in Mayberry didn‚Äôt go ahead and give me a DUI. ‚ÄúWas he nice to you?‚Äù Arnold‚Äôs voice creaked at me after the joint was long gone. ‚ÄúYeah he really was. I think he knows Tim too. He used to run around over in that area a lot and that cop couldn‚Äôt have been much more than a year or two older than Tim. Either way thanks for paying my bond. I didn‚Äôt even take a mugshot dude!‚Äù Arnold just grins and stares at me. I‚Äôm a mess. 

My icy blonde hair was still teased in the back but completely matted to the left side of my face from sleep earlier that morning in that tiny ass jail. I had one set of fake lashes still glued on but one set was long gone before I even went to jail that night. ‚ÄúWhy did you glue on fake eyelashes?‚Äù I was caught off guard by Arnold‚Äôs personal question. ‚ÄúWell I mean I thought they would make me look prettier or something. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I was embarrassed by his question and pulled the remaining set off with my back turned to him. 

What the fuck did I put those on for anyways? I probably look like a walking parody of myself. ‚ÄúArnold, I ain‚Äôt takin them alprazaloms anymore. Let me know if and when you get some extra oxys. For now I‚Äôm sticking to weed only. Fuck those alprazaloms hard man.‚Äù  ",1533404465.0

Especially as a young vet, sometimes I wish I didn't sign up and end up so fucked up.

In the end I ended up getting put on methadone, after switching between a lot of different meds, first was Oxy IR and SR(with naloxone) ended up on 80mg SR/day and 20mg IR/day. Then got moved between Bupe patches, Tapentadol (Palexia) which did nothing for me, Hydromorphone which is when I first started using a needle and damn was that good, then finally onto Methadone, where I am now.   
Now 40mg of Methadone a day with 15mg of oxy a day as IR. Take home meth tablets 30 days supply at a time. I've personally been up and down on my dose, not so much up, til recently, but tried cutting back every now and then which would last a a month or two. The best I got to was 20mg meth and no oxy. Recently pain, depression, sleep, PTSD got really bad and I was using a lot more than my prescribed dose, and so ended up running out, although, perhaps luckily, or not, I didn't runout before I started to drop my dose quite drastically to get it last longer, which has probably helped even only if it was for 5 days or so. About 24 hours after my last dose the WDs start kicking in, which at least helps me believe at least I was cutting down quite a bit, because I used to be able to go 2 days/48 hours after my last dose on my normal dose.

Luckily I scored some Suboxone for times like these, and also for when I choose to get off the stuff. Anyway I had looked up a while a go what the short term sub dosing for WDs was, and found an Australian recommended inpatient dosing regiment over 5 days for dealing with Heroin WDs. And they have links to studies, and found that as long as dosing is done for 5 days or less then it should help to alleviate WD without lengthening it, or delaying it. It does require you to get down to a certain dose beforehand. The dosing starts at 8mg a day (2 x 4mg) and goes down to 2mg a day on day 5. 
 
I did 1mg sub yesterday, when WDs were bad, this was my first dose, and whilst it didn't completely alleviate the symptoms, it made it a lot more bearable. I lasted 24 hours before I couldn't do it any longer and I dosed 2mg, and I whilst they aren't completely gone I feel a lot better, and almost normal, still have some craving and weird temperature fluctuations, but no more sweating, eye watering, RLS, irritability etc. and I figure, it will be better for me to go through some of it now, as it means I'm taking less than I need, and so tolerance is decreasing

I'm going to try only 1mg tomorrow, and if needed either another 1mg, or 0.5mg on day 4. Then hopefully I don't need anymore. I can deal with some discomfort, and pain. I do it on a daily basis. The pain is very bad, but I've somehow convinced myself its better than continuing on the path I'm on.

I get new scripts of methadone and oxy on Thursday or Friday, so lets hope I don't fall back off if I get there.

Day 2 down, preparing for sleep, one or 2 days max left.


tl;dr after years of chronic pain and opiates, after running out early, I'm using bupe to get through WD's and will try to stay off the stuff, although maybe just enough to reset my tolerance",1533404203.0

I literally just woke up, it's saturday morning. I blacked out for like 3 days, broke my brand new phone, took a bunch of books from my room and put them in my backyard, and did a bunch of random stupid things you do on xanax blackout. 

The only good thing about this was, that other than the sub I took on wednesday(8mg) I didn't experience any withdrawals(well that I remember) and I am doing ok now! Well, despite the fact I'm dealing with the repercussions of my blackout and having to explain to my boss I had a family emergency.",1533403406.0

My guess is pyramid scheme, bed bug cult invite or some kind of errand.


I can't imagine there being anything in it for me unless there's an input required of me. Like if he asks for money while offering me an opportunity then perhaps in his mind he thinks he isn't actually asking for anything.

&nbsp;

Perhaps he realized that I'm truly done with his bullshit and he's hashing a scheme to screw me over since he won't have to worry about me distancing myself from him as a consequence since I already have.

Could it be a last ditch effort on his part or am I just paranoid? Gosh, I don't really want to find out. I'm curious but I don't really mind not knowing as long he doesn't bother me.

I always envied the baby boy. He was my running mate as soon as I turned sixteen. He was nine. Running around with his scumbag sister and her good for nothing friends showed him a thing or two. By sixteen, the baby boy was an active member in the amphetamine underworld in the town I grew up in. 

When he turned 18 in June of 2011, it would take a little over a year for him to catch two felonies. Aggravated Assault causing bodily and aggravated retaliation assault causing bodily. Baby boy just caught 12 years of big boy time in gladiator school.  My poor mother. 

I had just gotten out of my first stint in rehab for my ‚Äúpill problem‚Äù and my mother had JUST accepted that she would have two kids afflicted by addiction. Me, her golden haired beauty with a gift for gab, and her baby boy. The one who couldn‚Äôt keep the spin pipe out of his mouth and the guns unloaded. He was charged and a year later arrested and tried at age 19 in August of 2012. 12 years. When my mother called and gave me the verdict I immediately called Arnold. 

Over the next few years, I would play the prison game with the baby boy. Communicating with him when he scored his first cell phone, and making a scene in the visitation hall when he showed up with bumps, bruises, and cuts. I hustled pictures to inmates in exchange for their protection of the inmate I was looking out for. My baby brother. The baby boy. The first time Tim reached out to me for something serious, I happened to be at Arnold‚Äôs. I was carrying on about fuck knows what when my phone rang. I smile, look at Arnold, and say ‚ÄúThe baby boy is calling! Man I love it when he calls and I‚Äôm here. You have so much more advice and information for him than I do.‚Äù Arnold had spent his twenties and thirties locked up all over Texas. Most of our visits consisted of him reliving the days before he got hurt. His prison days. ‚ÄúHey Tim, what‚Äôs up brother? Dude I‚Äôm over at Arnold‚Äôs y‚Äôall wanna chop it up for a few?‚Äù ‚ÄúSister, take me off speakerphone.‚Äù I glance at Arnold‚Äôs face and he‚Äôs got a concerned look. He waves his hand under his chin in a motion that says, don‚Äôt you fucking dare take him off speakerphone. ‚ÄúOkay little brother, you‚Äôre off speaker‚Äù I lied to him as I move closer towards Arnold so he could hear. 

‚ÄúOkay Concentratedgarbage, I need your help. I uh...I got mixed up in some stupid shit that you won‚Äôt get and I need $200 wired to this dude‚Äôs girl in the free world by 5:00 today. You got it right?‚Äù  No I didn‚Äôt fucking have it. I had just paid off my monthly tab with Arnold and was already starting to front again this very day. ‚ÄúLook brother. I don‚Äôt have it right now but I‚Äôll get it. I‚Äôll find something to sell. We just can‚Äôt tell Ma. She doesn‚Äôt do well when you get in trouble like this. ‚ÄúAh look sister it‚Äôs all good. I‚Äôll figure it out ya know?‚Äù I could hear the quiver in his voice. Arnold heard it too. ‚ÄúYou have one minute left‚Äù the recorded voice on the prison phone system warns us. ‚ÄúBrother who do I send it to? I‚Äôll make it happen.‚Äù He gives me a phone number to text and the line goes dead. 

A few beats go by before Arnold clears his voice and I come out of my fugue state. He says, ‚Äú Hand me my wallet.‚Äù  I do as he requests and go back to my chair and my phone where I‚Äôm already thinking of lies to tell family to get the cash together. ‚ÄúHere. You can‚Äôt tell me no and you won‚Äôt pay me back. This is something I have to do. They‚Äôll kill him over a misplaced bag of soups in there.‚Äù  I took the cash and went straight to the only gas station in town with a western union. He helped me take care of the baby boy like that countless times. 

Tim cried when he got my letter informing him of his savior‚Äôs passing. He cried and wrote me back. I received the tear stained letter on the day of his memorial. Like some kind of sick joke reminding me of what a junkie I‚Äôm being. ",1533360867.0

The entire exchange between his daughter and I had made me nervous. I felt very exposed.

On the way back to Tonya‚Äôs I had decided what I would do. 

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm about to head back down south. Fuck this town, why are you even still here?‚Äù Tonya stares at me as I talk these words and chain smoke on her porch. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to take them are you, Concentratedgarbage? Please don‚Äôt do yourself in like this.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo Tonya I‚Äôm not going to take them all myself. I have a plan.‚Äù I proceed to tell Tonya that I‚Äôll be renting a storage unit that I was already planning on doing and keeping the entire stock inside tucked away. Six entire hours away from where I live. I tell her I will only take one bottle at a time, keep a few for myself and sell the rest. ‚ÄúWould you like a cut of the profit?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want any of that dirty money. Do something good with it at least to make up for all the lives you‚Äôre ruining.‚Äù Jesus fucking Christ Tonya knows how to lay it on thick. 

After telling her I would take one bottle and store the rest, I proceed to take two bottles of oxy and one bottle of alps. ‚ÄúOkay let‚Äôs see how this goes, Concentratedgarbage. You got this shit girl. You can control your use because of how money driven you are. You‚Äôre better now. You‚Äôre not the junkie you used to be.‚Äù I told myself on my beautiful drive back home. 

Once I got home everything took off. I started doing better at work, getting a side business started that was actually successful, and also had to really work on my acting game. I started out great that first week. Wouldn‚Äôt take more than 3 doses from the time I woke up until bed, had a good set of people who were great chippers and always paid my asking price per pop. I fronted and used them to get things I wanted. If I was broke, all I needed was to find the local small time dboy and cut him a deal. It was great the first fuckin week. I proceeded to only end up selling 100 and I fucking took 200 down my gullet. After that first week I was redosing every hour. I stayed almost entirely nodded out when I wasn‚Äôt hustling parts of my stash. I ran out on the 28th. I had three hundred oxy 30s for 24 days and they‚Äôre gone with very little to show. My current state of affairs right now is a bit hopeful. I have decided to try and make one or two large sales and get the entire inventory out of my life. 

Tonya is very pleased. She‚Äôs been worried about me this month and with good fucking reason.

My dad is going in Monday for a double hip replacement. He is already in a pain management contract with his doctor who gave him x90 30s plus an additional x30 15s.

However I just don't feel like this will be enough. My dad has a huge tolerance and can easily take 300-500 mg of oxy a day just for the pain alone.

My question is I don't want my dad to suffer. The surgeon performing the surgery pretty much asked if he wants the hospital to administer their own meds or stick to my dad's pain management  contract. My dad said to stick with his PM doc. My dad's PM doc and surgeon have been in constant communication which is good.

Anyway to the point my dad wants to be put under general anesthia so he's asleep basically while under the knife. Will they give my dad anything for the pain say fentanyl, morphine iv drip, opana? Or do I just bring in his personal script of blues? He's going to be in the hospital for 2 nights

Obviously he's not going to accept any vicodins or percocets from the hospital as they won't do shit for him
 

I'm just worried the blues aren't going to touch his pain. 

Will the hospitsl administer fentanyl, morphine. Opana if they say he is in extreme pain without jeapordizing his pain management contract?

Thank you brothers. That's all I have to ask

Break one in half, take the other two whole, throw the half back in the bottle. 

My tolerance was down but not that low yet. I‚Äôd been basically clean for like two months now, last chip was only twenty pills and that was in May. That was when I called Tonya for the first time in almost two years and told her Arnold was bad. He didn‚Äôt look like the normal sick he was, but something more aggressive was taking the life out of him. Sure enough, by the end of May he had been put in the hospital only to discharge with hospice care. That last three days before he made his last trip to the hospital. Sepsis is hard to come back from if you‚Äôre already sick with diabetes and the lack of mobility.

I never saw any value in naloxone as I am a secret addict and always dose in private. No one would be around to give me naloxone or even know they should so I'm always super careful. Not a single person in the world knows of my problem, except for one addictions counselor who didn't believe me (even though it was only the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth) and some folks on the Internet like yourself.

I went to the pharmacy and asked about naloxone and ended up walking out with a free kit of two ampules and needles after a 15 minute personal training session given by the pharmacist. The same silly government that won't allow me to go on buprenorphine therapy without losing my job funds free naloxone kits for anyone that asks, I'll be dammed. At least they got one thing right.

Turns out this opiate crisis is even closer to home than I thought. I didn't know why he was sick, if I had I would have dosed him (if that is what he wanted), it would have been the humane thing to do. He was very surprised by my lack of judgement, knowledge, understanding and empathy for his problem. No one can help me but I will find him help the instant he wants it and he now knows that.

I'm almost postive this is my first time submitting a post. And im likely going to receive some hate for it. Its something thats really bugged me for some time now but I've always decided to let it go rather then piss someone off. This isnt directed at any one user as it happens every time this is mentioned.



   So here it goes.. I've noticed that any time someone refers to a 30mg oxycodone as a perc 30 someone always feels the need to correct that person and or make a smart comment pretending that they dont know what the persons refering to. Where I live and im sure other places across the us a perc 30 is the most common nickname for a 30mg oxycodone. Im willing to bet that 99% of the users here know exactly what the person is refering too just as if they were to call it a blue or m-box, or K9, roxi etc...

   


   The reason it bothers me when this happens is because i feel like it comes from that person in most cases as a way to belittle someone and make themselves feel superior as if they are some opiate expert. This type of thing I'd expect to see on r\trees or r\drugs when some 17 year old calls out a 15 year old for stating something incorrect about marijuana or r\drugs when someone makes an incorrect remark about fuckin Robitussin. It just seems so childish to me. Yeah we all know there isnt a 30mg Percocet, Its a nickname. Its not even like the person is ever actually calling it a 30mg Percocet which i would have less of an issue with someone correcting. They are using a commonly accepted street nickname for 30mg oxycodone.

   


   Ive heard people say well this is a site about harm reduction. Well if thats the case then call everything by its proper name. I mean what the fuck is a dilly or a panda?

   


   This is just gotten under my skin for a while now. Just had to put it out there and get it off my chest.

I was driving 75 down the interstate as I continued on my six hour journey. I like to listen to Black Stand-up comedians when I drive for long periods. Katt Williams and the like keep me giggling and distracted while I make this fucking boring ass drive. 

This time was different though. It was like I had accepted I was going to be clean forever once Arnold went into the hospital. I didn‚Äôt have the nerve to ask him for pills while he was actively dying. I just couldn‚Äôt. I was fucking proud of myself for finally feeling like I had it together. Here I was, standing by his side being here for the right reasons. What a joke. This trip was different. I was driving without the anticipation of getting high. I was making this trip solely because my friend had died and I was needed to help close out his final affairs. Look at me, not a junkie but such a great fucking friend. 

Lavelle Crawford is doing a bit on my Pandora Urban Comedian station. I love this dude. I think he‚Äôs one of the funniest black comedians of my time. Well, I don‚Äôt know how qualified I am to say that as a white thirty something chick but I digress. Lavelle Crawford is doing one of my favorite bits of his when Tonya calls. ‚ÄúYello?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere are you? Are you actually coming ? Where are you staying?‚Äù I lit another cig and inhaled the smoke before I started to answer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got about three and half hours to go and was hoping I could crash at your place. That cool?‚Äù Tonya goes on to agree that yes I can stay with her as she has this package for me that she‚Äôs nervous about. I still don‚Äôt have a fucking clue what she‚Äôs going on about. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that black gift bag, Concentratedgarbage. The one he had me hide all the time. It‚Äôs just a black paper bag. You know what I am talking about right?‚Äù I‚Äôm confused. Arnold rarely hid things from me unless I was getting out of control with my use, but it had been over a year since we had even had to have that conversation. Like I said, I was chipping and fine like that. ‚ÄúLook Tonya, I have no fucking clue what you‚Äôre talking about with this black bag but if it‚Äôs for me then he obviously wanted me to have it so just quit worrying about it.‚Äù Tonya snorted her goodbye and told me to call when I got to town so she could let me in. 

I pull over at a truck stop about a half hour from Tonya‚Äôs little apartment. I needed to take a shit and eat something and felt comfortable doing those things alone instead of inside Tonya‚Äôs tiny efficiency. I call her as I‚Äôm leaving. ‚ÄúBe there in ten or fifteen mins. Get the bag out. I want to see it first thing.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôm unlocking the front door now. You want any coffee?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôll drink a few cups with you. I feel like we should try and catch up some. Maybe you can get a few things off your mind, too.‚Äù Tonya finally gives me a laugh and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to hug your neck. I‚Äôm sorry he‚Äôs gone Concentratedgarbage, I know how close y‚Äôall got.‚Äù  I hung up. Tears crept up on me this time. Look at me, having actual emotions now. What a great fucking friend.

I pull up to Tonya‚Äôs place right at 2:00p. It‚Äôs fucking hot. She looks ten years older than she did last time I saw her in 2016. I believe it was hot then too. She smiles as I walk up and we almost look like a mother and daughter embracing after a long time away from each other. To normal people passing by, we looked like regular people meeting again after missing one another for regular reasons. That‚Äôs how it looked. Tonya knew what dark things went on between Arnold and myself. She knew how much of a junkie I used to be and never faulted me. Always treated me like I was a silly kid. She hugs my neck and immediately starts crying. Once again I‚Äôm stuck with dry eyes. ‚ÄúOh Concentratedgarbage it‚Äôs been HORRible. His kids are the WORST and nobody knows anything about his life from the last five years. I don‚Äôt know what to tell them!‚Äù ‚ÄúTonya, it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll talk to them. Show me this package. I need to know what the fuck he left me.‚Äù Tonya‚Äôs face sours. ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt know any better I would think you were on of his fucking piece of shit kids. They didn‚Äôt come around until he was dead and they could go through what he had that could make them some money.‚Äù ‚ÄúFuck you Tonya. Get the fuckin bag.‚Äù I rarely raise my voice as is, Tonya could sense my anger at her judgement. ‚ÄúPlease, get the bag Tonya.‚Äù

She goes into her closet and pulls out a box. Inside the box, a plastic bag that‚Äôs wrapped around something square and black. She rips the Wal-Mart sack off and reveals a black gift bag. Just a simple black paper sack. She comes and drops it into my lap. I can hear the sound of pills hitting plastic when the bag reaches my lap. Without a moments hesitation, I rip the bag apart where it had been staples shut at the top and gaze down upon my inheritance. 

Lining the bottom of this black bag were 32 bottles. 16 of the bottles each contained 150 OC 30s and the other 16 bottles each contained 100 green alprazalom. I gazed upon them for a few beats before I could look back up at Tonya, who had a smug ass look on her face that made me want to punch her directly in the cunt. 

**Okay guys, as promised I finished out the bag. Yesterday marked a month since I lost my friend and tomorrow marks a month since my discovery of this inheritance. If anyone wants to hear the rest of the story to present, then let me know. I always feel like such a shitbag about myself that it had to be pretty clear if people want to hear more. Thanks so much guys, it‚Äôs such a rush having people hear you. Like hear the real shit you‚Äôve been hiding from literally everyone except the one friend that died. And fucking Tonya. Bless her heart. ",1533326593.0

I have been taking them as directed for 6 days.  I did take 2 at once on the first day due to pain, but have otherwise stuck to the script.  My pain is now gone, and I'm ready to stop but want to be prepared.  Will I go through any withdrawal given my history?  Should I prepare myself with some kratom, lopes, or anything else?  Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Edit.  I'm almost 48 hours into recovering, so I wanted to edit this to answer the question for others in this situation who may be searching for answers.  Yes, I am going through some slight withdrawal.  On a scale from 1-10, 10 being the worst withdrawal I ever experienced at 120 mg per day; this one is a 2 or a 3.  Some slight diarrhea.  My nose is a bit runny and my skin and muscles have that weird electric feeling, but it's very mild.

At this point, I was a master at chipping. I had a decent job, no responsibilities other than this beat up blazer I drove back and forth to work. No kids no real relationships to maintain. My family and friends were all I needed. I was a high functioning user. Would be clean for a week, high a week, always smoked weed but my usage was highly maintained by Arnold.  Anytime he suspected I was ‚Äúcoming undone‚Äù he would either tell me he sold out for two weeks or only have enough to help me get clean. By fall of that year, I was doing fucking GREAT. I had lost a bunch of weight and got cute....oh boy, it was fucking on. I excelled at work, made more money, all the while Arnold kept a close eye on our bartering system. 

Arnold had a doozy for me right before Halloween that year.  He called me while I was at work one night, ‚ÄúSay, let‚Äôs talk some real business, Concentratedgabage. I have a favor to ask you but it‚Äôs going to require some work out of both of us, can you swing by tonight when you get off wor.....‚Äù  Now, a lot of you know how wonderful it is when your dboy needs a favor from you.  I interrupted him, ‚ÄúYeah man, lets talk right now. Whatcha got? Whatcha need? Can we work out a trade for whatever it is you‚Äôre gonna need? Could you go ahead and front it to me tonight and I‚Äôll do the favor whenever dude.‚Äù He had already grown tired of my ranting and had hung up on me. I knew it was going to be an evening I got high. He always paid me for any time I spent with him even when I told him he didn‚Äôt have to, he did. This drug is funny like that. Gives you a reason to worship someone if it means they‚Äôll break you off something. He knew I would do anything I could for him because he would always compensate me in the only way I wanted to be paid. 

I jumped in my barely legal blazer, fired up a cig, and popped the last OC 30 I had. I wasn‚Äôt worried about being too frivolous with my stash. I had a feeling it was going to be the last time I would have to worry about posting another front or doing a crazy amount of side work just to stave off the sickness. At this point in my use, w/ds weren‚Äôt really as bad as we know they can be with heavier use, but I still had already started to spend less and less time sober and/or clean. I took a longer road home that night just to enjoy my life the exact way it was for a few minutes longer. I knew I was about to last off and I was ready. 

The exact same ritual every single time I‚Äôve ever pulled into Arnold‚Äôs. Pull into the side driveway, get out, walk up to the camera, ensure I stand there long enough for him to know I‚Äôm there and it‚Äôs me. The door is unlocked. He never felt the need to lock it as nobody dared approach his camera without a rock solid reason to be on his property. 

He was mean as a snake. Everyone in town thought he was insane. There were just a few people that had anything to do with him. Then there was me. Nobody questioned me. I‚Äôm sure they talked some but never to my face. 

I walked in, plopped down on my chair that was across from him, and he has already put the tray with the weed and some papers out on his table he keeps close. I immediately start rolling us a few doobies. His hands didn‚Äôt work well enough to actually twist a joint but he could light and smoke one without any help. ‚ÄúYou always roll them too fat. The next one needs to be thinner. Roll me five to get through tomorrow afternoon.‚Äù   I continue to roll another joint and smirk because he and I both know living alone in one room for the passed ten years has made him into such an obsessive lunatic. I always humored him though. He was allowed to be crazy over the size of his doobies without any judgement from me. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs this business you wanted to talk to me about? You said it would require some work on both ends but you felt it would be worth it to me? What‚Äôs the deal? Why is your living room such a wreck? Is Tonya not coming around anymore?‚Äù He had already grown weary of my talking. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I wanted to talk to you. She quit today, and I don‚Äôt trust anyone in this fucking town except you and her, and she‚Äôs getting too old and sick to continue doing my home care each week.‚Äù It took a minute for it to sink in what he was getting at. He was fully disabled in the state we were in and was given 42 hours a week of home care by an employee of one of the large Home health agencies in our state. It paid ten bucks an hour and the only requirement the company that provides the care giver has is that you have no felony. I was a fucking shoe-in for the job. About two weeks later I was his home care giver. Since I had a full time job that was mainly night shifts I would go over to his place every morning and do house work cook for him and then we would also just chill and smoke. Every two weeks I had an extra $475 in my pocket plus my regular salary. I was able to work two jobs and make decent money that was legit all while having a direct line to my source for the chemicals that allowed me to have the energy to work two full time jobs at once. We carried on like that for two years. I eventually decided to move away and so the jig was up. Went back to chipping every two months and my life started going great again. I knew it was coming to an end every time I would go by his house when I would make the drive to pick up some 30s and see my old friends. He looked weaker and skinnier every trip I made. March of this year, I went by his place and knew he looked worse than ever before. I begged him to go to the hospital but he vehemently declined. He got angry with me so I backed off. 

I got a call on the second of July. It was fucking hot as shit outside and I was running out of chances to step outside and check my phone. 

I had been to the hospital six hours away from where I am currently living three times in the last seven days. Would leave after work at six and get to the hospital at eleven. Sit by his side until 4p the next day and try to get back before ten that night. He was fucking dying but was completely lucid and awake. His body was failing from years of not moving and chain smoking. The wounds on his feet slowly crawled up his legs and poisoned his blood. The doctor had already told him he was terminal and wouldn‚Äôt get over this. They could take his leg but even if he survived that surgery his other organs were already starting to fail. I sat by his bed and we talked about death. He would say he wasn‚Äôt ready. Then would stare at me while I tried to cry. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to make it outta this. I‚Äôm not leaving this hospital alive.    

I finally was able to go outside and call Tonya back. She had called three times in the last ten minutes. She came back to him in May when I called her and told her how bad of shape he was in. She stayed by his side everyday until the second. ‚ÄúConcentratedgarbage he‚Äôs fucking gone. He‚Äôs dead. Arnold is dead. He‚Äôs never coming back. You need to come up here. Tell me when you‚Äôre coming when you know‚Äù and the line went silent. I shakily tried to call her back but she turned off her phone. Nobody in my office knew of any of this. Tears stung my eyes. Fuck. I instantly missed him. Felt a space in myself. My friend died. 

I end up leaving work early and spent the next two days in a very disconnected state of mind. I left the morning of the forth. The office was closed. I called Tonya.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming up, just left. Should be there by one.‚Äù She snorts into the phone, ‚ÄúMust be fucking nice to not have to be here when they come and got his body or when I had to call his kids and tell them.‚Äù ‚ÄúFuck, Tonya I‚Äôm sorry. I couldn‚Äôt get away until today. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve been doing this all alone. I‚Äôm doing my god damned best it takes me six fucking hours to drive there. Cut me some fucking slack. You were gone for nearly two fucking years and I‚Äôve not busted your balls once.‚Äù She softened a bit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just so stressed out. I need you to help me take care of his final expenses. He gave me directions but told me you had all of his passwords and pins. He also left you something. I don‚Äôt know what it is but he said make sure you get it once he is dead. Y‚Äôall had some kind of weird relationship so who knows what it is. Just get up here as quick as you can. I am tired of holding onto to it.‚Äù 

**Okay guys I am going to finish out soon. I have a couple things I have to do this afternoon but I will round off the story. I‚Äôm so glad that there are some folks who are reading. 95% of everything I‚Äôm writing is the truth but it‚Äôs up to you to believe that or not. I need this demon out of my mind and having an anonymous way to tell it to so many like minds is saving me right now. That and kratom and weed. Thanks guys.

Weird cycle, I know. But I had multiple failed detox attempts, everytime I would detox and get through WD, id fall into the deepest ever depressive suicidal state and end up relapsing. I quit methadone almost CT, while in a psych. ward. And when I got out, really didn't wanna relapse, But my main reason for opioid use was my TRD/MDD which I did not respond to several meds.

So I thought i was clean, got on tianeptine, used that as a crutch. I was buying it in bulk, buy the grams, I started shooting it, until I destroyed all my veins, and was megadosing, and at a certain point had to switch to oral, because my veins were destroyed.

Detoxed basically CT in the psych ward again, it was absolute hell. Got out, and this time, I remembered reading about kratom and its mild opioid properties, started this, and it really helped and worked in the beginning, but after 2 yrs, my dose went up to 70g a day, and I was taking it just to function.

Finally, came across ibogaine, did some quick research, talked with the owner for a few weeks, very passionate guy, skyped with him as well, once I finally felt comfortable, went to mexico and did a 7 day detox.

I made a post about in another sub. But just thought i'd share my history with opiates here. I just got back from the clinic a few days ago. Very short drive from San Diego. It was nothing like I expected, luxurious, and better treatment than any healthcare I ever received in the US, fully staffed medical facility, with Dr's, Nurses, Therapists, Cook/Maid, My own bedroom w/bathroom, and right on the beach.

 I finally feel some relief without opioids in my system. I just hope this lasts.....I am going to try maybe looking into iboga booster doses to stay off. I hope the suicidal depressive episodes dont come back.

Still battling depression, but really feel much better than I have in years.  I really hope I can keep this up. Any suggestions?

And of course, I know aftercare is very important. If I had the money, I would just start a new life and leave my current environment.",1533318600.0

the comments always end up breaking rules and delving into location talk. and using the search bar to search old posts will answer 99% of these questions, anyway. 

2. we are no longer allowing asking for advice on dosing.
this is really potentially dangerous and a liability. 

3. this was already a rule and in the rulle sticky thread, but reiterating because of how many of these i remove per day: we are no longer allowing any type of pill ID posts. 
there is no way for us to tell, a mistake is too risky and possibly deadly. assume your pills are fake and dose accordingly. test your pills if you really want to know. search old threads if you want to compare to pics of other reals/fakes.

4. please for the love of god try google/search bar before asking your question. 

5. lastly, feel the need to address this again because of the amount of comments i have to remove under this premise on here... trolling/bullying/hate speech is not permitted. telling people to overdose is not OK - you will get banned. have some fuckin respect for the human on the other side of the screen.. 

edit also 6. if you are not a mod please do not comment about the purpose of this sub or what *you think* doesnt belong here. recovery posts are on topic, welcomed, allowed and always will be. posts about drugs that arent opiates are allowed if it leads to some type of discussion.  offtopic posts are allowed at mod discretion given they produce discussion, dont break rules. if you are not a mod dont comment about how you think we should run things around here.  thank you.",1533316403.0

I've never even seen this stuff (Canada), but I've now got my hands on some, and will likely only be using tar for some time now.

I've always injected number Number 4 and nothing else (other than potential fentanyl or other cuts I'm unaware of). I have access to a needle exchange and can get my hands on any equipment needed. I'm also an addict and will be subsisting on tar and injecting it several times a day, if that makes a difference.

With that said, what should I know when transitioning fron powder to tar? Do I need to cook it differently? Do I need to use vitamine C with this stuff? Or is it identical to Number 4 in terms of injecting? Do you find that you need a higher or lower dose? Are there harm reduction-related things to know about tar that don't apply to Number 4? Anything else I should know?

Thanks again for any answers. I'll be using this stuff regularly and I and everyone around me knows nothing about this stuff, making me concerned that I might do something particularly dangerous or wasteful.",1533313599.0

94awxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/94awxv/my_inheritance/,33,https://redd.it/94awxv,concentratedgarbage,My inheritance.,"Twelve years ago, I met a man who was partially paralyzed and was looking to trade his pain pills for weed. I just so happened to be a college chick who sold small amounts of weed and had a large taste for those lovely PKs. We became fast friends. 

Me, smart young fledgling junkie who hadn‚Äôt lost anything yet, and him, a bitter and sick man at age 42. He knew I would always be there for him because he held my first true love, hydrocodone 10s. I was no stranger to manipulation but I was new to the junkie life. It wasn‚Äôt until about six or seven years into our friendship that I realized the power he had over me. 

It was a never ending supply. Alprazolam came next and royally fucked my world for about a year. Two years ago are when I first met the OC 30s. Over the years he went from hydro to the oxys...or rather, I went from the hydros to the oxys. Anywho, the first 30 I ate was bliss. ‚ÄúThis,  Arnold, this is what I‚Äôve always needed‚Äù I remember saying. He just gave me a look that said nothing and everything. It‚Äôs a funny thing when you have a limitless supply of something. You go ahead and adjust your way of living behind the notion that things will never change and the supply will never deplete. The day I saw the black gift bag that was presented to me on the 4th of July was nauseating. ‚ÄúNo fucking way. Where did you get this shit? Did anyone see you take it? Oh. It‚Äôs mine?‚Äù I thought I could finally stay off of them now that he was dead and the supply ran out, but little did I know the amount of work ahead of me. 

Idk if anyone wants to hear more but it‚Äôs cathartic letting this shit out to those who truly understand these special situations some of us on this sub have been in and literally have nobody you can share with. I did change a name to protect my friend. Not that anyone would know him but now that he is dead I feel the need to continue the way we were, which was very private and knowing that we both knew and understood the reasoning behind a young blonde‚Äôs willingness to spend such an extensive amount of time with a man such as he. We both knew it. I feel haunted by what I have and it feels so nice to release it in here but if nobody wants to read anything else I am good with that too. ",1533312740.0

As you embark upon the strange and horrifying journey that is reading this book, it may cause you to question whether bringing a child into this world is the right thing to do anymore. It may not be. I don‚Äôt know. As your eyes travel the lines of ink, you may ask yourself why you‚Äôre even reading such trash. That‚Äôs on you. I can‚Äôt say. As your mind moves from thought to thought, you may wonder, ‚ÄúHow does a person come up with such inane dialogue or depraved violence or this ridiculous storyline?‚Äù This one, I can answer. 

Boogers.

Boogers are the unthinking result of any human being when certain extrabodily substances are breathed in. The body has no need for these things, namely dirt, particle debris or dust and the sloughed, dead skin cells of other human beings. So, the nose excretes mucus to catch the unwanted waste floating in the air, dries out and creates a nice little morsel to be easily extracted with a finger and flicked or wiped under your desk.

My writing process is the same. Unwanted information comes at me all day in the form of conversations between strangers at the store, jokes my friend told me fourteen years ago, old footage of hydrogen bombs exploding in desert, the obnoxious and steroid fueled ramblings of Macho Man Randy Savage and the like. My mind traps these bits of useless stimuli by excreting my imagination and personality like a mucus into my brain that dries out to create another kind of easily extracted morsel, but instead of wiping them on seats or the back of someone else‚Äôs shirt, I write. Words, as I know them, can be salty or bloody or crunchy or slimy or any combination of those things just like boogers. 

Every sentence is a booger.

There were three other books I wanted to write: one about an angry old man who rides public transportation all day giving out extremely bad and unsolicited advice to strangers, another one about a rag tag group of immigrant sheepherders, and one about a homeless piece of Kleenex who struggles through life until he finally gets a break and starts a family of his own outside of Kansas City. The one about the Kleenex was a feel-good piece, one for the whole family to enjoy, but it was too short as were the other ones. So, I waited. I let my mind do what it does, the way my nose does what it does.

After a while, I put my finger in there, dug around and pulled this thing out. It‚Äôs called The Terrible Hop Brothers. I hope you can forgive me, because it is. Absolutely. Terrible.

Your Friend,

Riley

The Terrible Hop Brothers.  

The Ballad of Rufus Cumberbutt

The popularly circulated fiction that is our siblinghood begins with a transsexual prostitute from Bolivia who went by the name Naranja, claiming to be sweeter than any orange any man could buy at any super market in town. She may have been. I never found out just how sweet she was, but when I hear people refer to Rufus as my brother, I think of her. 

She was the one who said it first. Rufus adopted it and introduced me to everyone as his brother after that, and he knew pretty much everyone. It was on a summer morning, and we were way up the hill in the middle of the city in the blinding white, light of the sun. The city never gets like that. Sometimes, the sun comes out and you have to take your jacket off, but this was like high noon in the Sahara, which is so abnormal its making this whole memory seem like a dream to me. And I don‚Äôt even know what we were doing up there, the way you just kind of end up in situations with your friends or family or other random people doing and saying crazy things in dreams.

So, there we were. I don‚Äôt remember why, but I do remember Rufus was in the middle of telling me he was going to need to fix soon. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna need to fix soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?  It's too hot.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Boom Boom, I‚Äôm not feeling good.‚Äù He had a habit of prematurely telling people that he was sick. He would even say it between nods, but this time he wasn‚Äôt exaggerating too badly. Our habits were about the same. We‚Äôd split our last heroin together, and I was starting to feel normal again myself.

‚ÄúOkay. Well, lets go see Carlos or Juju or Leroy. I got a few bucks.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù On the way down the hill, our hips swaying side to side and our shoes slapping the sidewalk as we absorbed the shock, he began to talk. It never failed to blow me away how ridiculous his statements could be. ‚ÄúYeah, Boom Boom, I‚Äôm thinking about becoming an artist.‚Äù

‚ÄúAn artist? What do you know about art?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing really, but that don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you figure that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, half of art is just who the artist is and other crap like that. It doesn‚Äôt have to be that great.‚Äù

He did have a point. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kinda true, but still.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut still, what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. What kind of stuff are you gonna paint?‚Äù

Rufus produced a bottle of ginger-ale out of nowhere, like a magician. Now, he offered it to me. I wasn‚Äôt a germaphobe, but Rufus was extra-unhygienic. He wore a raggedy, red beard, which always held the coagulated globules of some rancid grease or clots of half-chewed food in half-hardened chunks like dead baby birdies decaying in a nest or something. It smelled bad. Even worse, though, were his bleeding gums and the breath that came with his rotten mouth. Something unspoken inside of me would never let me drink after him. I realize now it was fear of catching his bad breath. Maybe that was irrational, but I just wouldn‚Äôt do it. 

He held the drink out a moment longer before I put my palm up and shook my head. It disappeared after that. 

‚ÄúWell, Boom Boom, I have thought long and hard about this.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I have. As you know, my name is Rufus Cumberbutt.‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúAnd if you wanted to get technical, that would be Dr. Rufus Cumberbutt, the third.‚Äù

I opened my eyes and smiled. I‚Äôd never heard the bit about him being a third. One would have been enough. 

‚ÄúSo, the pieces will be called Cumberbutts. See? That already puts them in class with, I don‚Äôt know, let‚Äôs say a Monet? A Warhol? A Dali? A Cumberbutt.‚Äù

‚ÄúHaha. I don‚Äôt know about all that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. On top of the name, my hardened street persona and the intrigue of my character will bolster value in a major way. I‚Äôm telling ya! Hop head extraordinaire and street criminal Rufus Cumberbutt, a man who rejected a successful career as a doctor to live on the streets. How much more interesting could an artist be? Huh? I mean, I could even fake my own death.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. We‚Äôll make it really violent and mysterious.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe? Whatever. But what are they going to look like. You never said.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be pleased to hear that I‚Äôve also given a lot of attention to this aspect of being an artist, as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean the art?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, my dear Boom Boom, the art. The art will be as mysterious and dark and genius as the artist himself. I will paint with black and red only on white canvas. The art will be simple. It will just say dark and cryptic things in like an old typewriter font. I might have to get someone else to help me with all that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Maybe they can just do it for you. What will the quotes be?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you‚Äôve given this so much thought.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have. It‚Äôs still in the works. I will sign them R. Cumberbutt, though. Or just Rufus. And there‚Äôll only be 4 or 5 ever made.‚Äù

‚Äú4 or 5 prints of each piece?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, sir. 4 or 5 pieces total.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, the shorter my career, the more mysterious, the more mysterious, the more valuable. Less pieces make them harder to find. When they‚Äôre harder to find, the more they cost. You understand?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt get an answer from me. Besides, the fact that everything he‚Äôd just said was ridiculous and that he wasn‚Äôt even joking, we were outside of the New Honk Kong Hotel a few blocks from downtown. I had business there. We were an inseparable duo, except for all the times we got separated. Like that day. That day we got separated, even though we never meant to. 

‚ÄúRoof, I‚Äôm a run up here real quick. I gotta see Bug.‚Äù Bug was one of two black, identical twins from Michigan. Bug and Boo. Apparently, they‚Äôd gone by those names since they grew up in the 60s there. 

‚ÄúK. I‚Äôll be here.‚Äù

As I entered the bottom of the dark stairway into the hotel, I whispered the word eyeball to myself three times. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball. Then again at the top of the stairs while I was waiting for the hotel manager to buzz the gate. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball. And after I signed in with my fake ID card at the front desk, I whispered again. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball. One more time as I knocked on the door at room 408. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball.

The fading heroin high sat in my throat like a warm sticky egg. I also imagined that the feeling it left in my stomach was a molten heavy metal like lead or mercury. Bug‚Äôs muffled voice came through the door.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me. Boom Boom.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got some money. I was wondering if you could help me out.‚Äù 

As soon as the chain lock came off the door, I pushed it open. He knew something was up and moved towards the window, where he turned sideways and bowed like a scared child. A young boy, maybe 19, maybe 18, I don‚Äôt know, lay on the bed wearing nothing but a kimono. His bangs stuck to his sweaty face. The room smelled like silicone and salty sweat. The boy was making weird spaceship sounds and gesturing wildly in the air. It was clear whatever amount of meth he‚Äôd just shot was too much for him. Bug was naked and shaking.

‚ÄúWhat you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúI come for Jimbo. He sent me per the Faceless One‚Äôs request. You know why I‚Äôm here?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond. That was a yes as much as anything. I didn‚Äôt really know what I was doing there, though. I just knew we were all bad people doing bad things and when we got what we got around these parts, it was because we lived the lives we lived. No surprises. No tears. Just street life. 

I tried to get Bug to calm down. 

‚ÄúI like this Buddha statue you got here. Do you ever rub it for good luck?‚Äù Certain parts of his brain had never developed from childhood. They had atrophied. It was most notable in his speech patterns. He talked like a kid.

‚ÄúNo. Never.‚Äù

I put my hand on the large brass statue. Bug jerked and reached toward his headboard and produced a knife. I broke his foot with the Buddha. As he fell to the floor, I stepped on his chest and bent down making a U shape with my thumb and pointer finger. They slowly pushed in around the eyeball and this strange series of thoughts and emotions ran through me.  I remembered being a kid with my sister, when our mom took us down to Mississippi to see her father late one spring. We stayed several weeks and into summer, and in the yard at our grandfather‚Äôs house, we had these weird mud things sticking out of the ground. He told us they were mudbug huts, like crayfish. We even took our little arms and pushed them down into the muddy holes searching for the little creatures. 

Wrist deep and sweating in that room with the slime of his eye socket on my skin, it reminded me of that, but unlike the crustaceans in my grandfather's yard when I was a boy, his eye was easy to find. It snapped in a dull thud, muffled by his brain and head. I had it.

He cried on the floor. There wasn‚Äôt much blood. He would never say anything about it because if he did, he knew it would be more of the same or much worse. The boy in the kimono kept swooshing and swishing and now he was chewing a blue ink pen that had broken in his mouth and ran all down the side of his chin and face. I got my fake ID from the front desk and walked outside. 

The sun blinded me again. Rufus told me to hold on. He ran down the block to see someone, but it looked like he ran to tell the cops to arrest him. They just happened to see him at the corner. They knew his mug and ran his name which came back with warrants. 

He was always going to jail. I never went. And I always thought that was funny because I was the one doing the really bad stuff. He was in trouble for pan handling or sleeping in the park and not paying his tickets. I was literally picking the pink flesh from another man‚Äôs eye socket like a piece of pulp from my thumbnail and trying to find something to put the eyeball in so that it wouldn‚Äôt get crushed as I watched him get cuffed.

Naranja was at the corner as I passed. Rufus smiled at me from the back of the car. The window was down, and he heard her ask me why my brother had just gotten arrested. Rufus howled from the back seat. 

‚ÄúBROTHER?!?!?! Oh no! If that don‚Äôt beat all. Boom Boom‚Äôs my brother, boys, y‚Äôall hear that?‚Äù 

The cops looked at me. It was more attention than I needed. I had an eyeball in my breast pocket, which I had to get to Jimbo‚Äôs shop ASAP. Rufus seemed to think it was hilarious, and when he got out a few days later, he told everyone we were brothers. Sometimes, I daydream of giving her grief for the irritation it‚Äôs caused me since she asked him that question, and I would. 

But she‚Äôs dead. They found her body behind a dumpster several years back, stabbed in the neck, face, head and hands 58 times according to the newspapers and left to choke in a puddle of her own blood. That‚Äôs life on these streets. That‚Äôs how it can end, at any second. But, it is only a rumor (us being brothers, that is, not her murder.

My younger self often pondered who i would be at this age. And.. now that I‚Äôm here?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ shit. Im in a rut. The ultimate low. I have made possibly the worst decisions and acted in possibly the most detrimental way in regards to living a happy, healthy, productive and successful life. 
BUT.


I still feel positive.

I am confident.

I can make change. 

I have passion inside of me.

I have intelligence and competence inside of me.


The reality is, whether I like it or not, this phase of depression, drug abuse and isolation is now apart of my life‚Äôs novel. No going back now. So, considering that, all I can do now is, whilst I am sober and on the way upwards in life,  let this be my reminder of how bad my life was getting, and how close i have been to getting sucked into taking a very dark path for the long term. 
I have always thought that I will never ever live the conventional, underwhelming, opportunity-wasting life of a broke life-time junkie. The reason for this is because i have always felt deep in my heart, with the utmost certainty, that it would be ME that just would simply not allow that to happen, under any circumstances. And thus I‚Äôve never worried for the long-term. 
However, I‚Äôve learnt a valuable life lesson. 
It CAN happen, it WILL happen and it HAS BEEN happening. Just because I think ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never let that happen‚Äù, ‚ÄúI wont lose control of everything‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stop all of this really soon and go back to a normal life‚Äù, that doesn‚Äôt mean anything unless I am  MAKING DECISIONS ACCORDINGLY with living the life I want to live in the short term, so that I can experience it in the long term. 

I will change. 

I will do good.

I will follow my passions.

I will BE PRESENT IN THE MOMENT.

I will be happy. 

And when does it start?

Well thats the beauty of it.

It.

Starts.

Right after this next bag. hehe.",1533300426.0

They totally draw you in, till you snap out of it and then you're like WOAH, only to nod right back to a new CEV unfolding in front of your closed eyelids. 

It's like the first time you got really high on an opiate and you'd have those waking dreams start once you closed your eyes. This is still easily achievable with a high dose of opis alone, but if you want to have nice nods from less opiates and a little bit of cheap cough syrup, I highly recommend this combination. If anybody has some experience to share about this combo I'll be happy to hear it! And, as always, please be careful - you may have a high tolerance but in cases like this one with DXM, potentiating opiates may cause you some unexpected reactions.

I was actually just approved for disability (small yay) a couple months ago, the judge actually approved me that day and said it was one of the worst cases she's seen.

I've tried humira, stellara, imuran, gs-5745 (experimental), remicade, mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and of course steroids. My gi doesn't even know what to try next. Nothing is working. I've been hospitalized more times than I can count. Also had a bowel resection a couple years ago.

I usually go to my GP for pain meds (120 5mg and a few times 7.5mg percocet for the past two years) which just barley helps enough to keep me sane, however last visit he cut it down to 100. It seems like he's trying to get me off them...randomly...


I really can't do this without something for the pain. It's constant, I can't sleep, eat, or enjoy anything. I don't really know what to do.

It's worth noting I'm a pretty passive person and have a hard time fighting for myself, especially to doctors and stuff. I always feel like if I push I'll just get cut off and be labeled a drug seeker.

This may be a dumb post but in all honesty I'm a bit panicky and overwhelmed right now at the thought of having nothing to relieve the pain. Thank's for reading.

I had been on immodium since we met, we met right when I was kicked off suboxone in December and I tried to withdrawal but ended up relapsing on Dope for a month then on immodium.  I had a suboxone appointment this past Tuesday and I didn‚Äôt want to take any more immodium because I had been feeling chest tightness and it was scaring me.  So I used her car to go try to get some Xanax pills.  She found out by checking my location and she was so angry.  I didn‚Äôt even get the Xanax I turned around right away because she said she was gna leave the house without her phone.  I got home and she was gone, I called her parents and tried to find her then she came back at 5 am.  Then we weren‚Äôt really talking much that day cause she was mad at me and I was upset because I felt so bad but also like i just did it because I didn‚Äôt want to take immodium and I felt it wasn‚Äôt that bad.  Then I wake up the next morning and I see she had texted me saying she loved me and I could come sleep upstairs rather than on the couch, but that she didn‚Äôt know how to get past this.  She wasn‚Äôt home I thought she was at work and a couple hours police showed up and said she had shot herself in the head.  She parked her car somewhere and walked off into the woods and killed herself.  And it‚Äôs all my fault I‚Äôm so fucking stupid and horrible she was everything tobme she was how I finally wanted to be alive again, I had gotten a job and then moved across the country to be with her.  My baby girl died scared and alone and she had been saying she was toxic for me and we were never going to work out but she was so wrong she made me so fucking happy.  She had been sexually abused as a child and never really got help so she said she just always had this anger and sadness inside her and hurt.  And she had such issues trusting me because of what had happened to her.  When I relapsed in January we had only been dating a month and she left me and I knew I wasn‚Äôt good enough for her so I started talking to a new girl but not serious but last week she told me she still checked that girls face book every other day to see what she had that she didn‚Äôt.  But I told her that that girl was my second choice, I only got with her because she had left me! And then after a couple weeks me and that girl stopped and me and my baby got back together.  She was so amazing and so sweet but she was just so hurt and I didn‚Äôt get her help soon enough.  We had been talking to get her a therapist and she had called a bunch but couldn‚Äôt find one that was a female and also took her insurance.  I should have tried harder to help her find one.  I should have answered her text that night.  I should have sucked up through the withdrawal and not left to get Xanax.  I should have gotten off the immodium months ago.  I should have tried harder to show her how much I loved her how I truly meant that she was the most incredible and beautiful person I had ever met and that I was truly wanting to spend my entire life loving her and trying to make her happy.  I‚Äôm so so sorry baby I‚Äôm so sorry I didn‚Äôt help you enough.  I don‚Äôt know how to go on all I can think aboht is relapsing and dying to be with her.  I barely have any friends anymore because of my past issues with drugs even tho I haven‚Äôt used heroin in a year and a half except those couple weeks in January.  I posted this in the opiate recovery sub but it is just getting worse every day I don‚Äôt know how to survive this.

The result is always the same, inevitably I reach a point where I appear to only have two choices, either dose and end the withdrawal or do something crazy. No worries, this isn't one of those posts, I very much don't want to do something stupid like that but I can easily see that could happen if I was in withdrawal again and didn't have anything to make me well. I've been dosing a couple of times a day for the last year, just enough to keep me well but ultimately it's only a matter of time before my inventory is exhausted and then I will be in withdrawal with nothing to dose.

It seems the easy answer before that inevitably happens is the ultra rapid detox where you are in an intensive care unit, put into a medically induced coma and then on a naloxone drip for 6 or 8 hours. One popular protocol seems to be the [Waismann Method¬Æ]( http://www.opiates.com) but I've compiled a list of clinics all over the world that offer something similar.

Almost every single day I make the trip, leave at 8 am get home about 10:30. Rarely will I meet him at a house 10 mins from his house, maybe once every couple weeks.

So Saturday he disappears. I was supposed to meet him for a half, but I decided to postpone until Sunday because then I‚Äôd be able to get 1.5 instead and save myself the fucking whack ass drive for the next 2 days. I guess he‚Äôd left with the half planning on meeting me, and then got pulled over and arrested for it. He gets out of jail Tuesday and is dead serious when saying it‚Äôs my fault he went to jail. 

Now this morning I‚Äôm fucking sick cuz I‚Äôm stuck with someone else‚Äôs bunk shit, and I didn‚Äôt have the time to wait all morning for him. Now he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou keep making me leave my house I‚Äôm gonna cut you the fuck off fr.‚Äù Um I‚Äôm sorry, but YOU choose to lead this life. You are a fucking drug dealer for God‚Äôs sake. Let me say here too that the last time I met him away from his house he pulled out at least a ball of coke from his backpack he was riding with. There are times you‚Äôve rode so much more dirty than that and could have been in way worse shit. But you let yourself get caught with a measly ass fucking .5. How is that my fault???

I‚Äôve never done this dude wrong. I‚Äôve been loyal to him, I do him favors (not fucking sexually) and I also help him out with shit. I am honestly shocked that he is really serious about thinking it‚Äôs my fault. WHY WOULD ANYONE LET THEMSELVES GET CAUGHT WITH A HALF??? I don‚Äôt get it. Is it my fault???? I mean what can I do to help him if it is??? Ugh please give me your thoughts on this shit cuz I‚Äôm tired of him talking to me like shit.

I remember it vividly. I was 19. I was with my bf (at the time) in a Walgreens parking lot. He was in the driver's seat, doing his best not to look at me. I was a sweaty mess puking out the passenger door while crying hysterically. 

We had run out of OxyContin the day before and we were both sick as fuck. It was not the first time I had experienced withdrawal; in fact this was probably like a full year into our addiction. But for some reason the gravity of our situation hit me like a fucking truck. The money we were spending, the lies to our families, the items we had stolen and pawned, the fucking eviction notice we got earlier that day. 

""We're fucking junkies!"" I wailed. ""This isn't supposed to be my life!"" ""What are we going to do???"" I was inconsolable.

""Get a fucking grip"" he hissed at me. He was disgusted with me, how weak I was.  Fuck I was too. 

I sucked in air through gritted teeth until my lungs felt like they were going to explode. ""FUCK YOU"" I screamed. Customers in the parking lot all turned to look in unison. I didn't fucking care. I was absolutely destroyed in that moment. I knew I had one choice. Kill him and then myself. I could see no other way out. 

And then my phone vibrated

'All good com thru' Damion, my dealer, texted.

And when they test it they test the metabolites to see exactly what you‚Äôve been taking. 
      Well around July my number came up... usually have a spare bottle of piss on me, but today wasn‚Äôt a good day and I was already out to begin with, had been for like a day and a half. My last shot was an opana 40 and snorted maybe 10 more mg at lunch that day, and that was almost exactly 36 hours ago. Long story short I was fucked. So I go in drinking a shit load of water knowing it damn well wasn‚Äôt going to help either but hey what the hell. So I pissed in a cup and went back to work. They usually take about a week or two for the results to come back.
     Well a week goes by and I get the phone call I‚Äôd been waiting on from medical telling me that I‚Äôd failed. They asked if I had been taking any other medications. And low and behold I‚Äôd had sinus surgery at the beginning of the year. Script for perc 7.5s. So I told them that I had taken some of those from getting hit in the face playing basketball.
    Ok well we‚Äôre going to get our information together and we‚Äôll call you back. So I scheduled vacation for the week after next. Since I travel. Didn‚Äôt wanna go all the way to BFE just to get fired and come back home... so I went to researching things... turns out, oxycodone can metabolize into oxymorphone. Got a call back from doctor lady saying everything was good and that with the information I had provided my test was negative. She was still concerned though..
      Since I she had looked into my medical history, she found out that I‚Äôd been to rehab in the past. So she has currently put me out of work pending I talk and get evaluated by a counselor. So I called the boss and he said my week of vacation wouldn‚Äôt go through either.. so I‚Äôve even still got that... only bad news is I‚Äôll be off work for 2-3 weeks pending the evaluation... which will probably also come with another drug test.

I woke up in an ambulance to beeping sounds, EMT chatter, and the inescapable feeling that my lungs were super glued together. I literally could not breathe. I finally managed to separate my lungs and got a bit of air, but they clamped right back down, after I managed to let out a whimpering ‚ÄúHELP!‚Äù

‚ÄúGet him something in case he throws up.... Raoul, how much did you take?‚Äù

I draw another breath, lifting what literally felt like 1,000lbs on my chest, and sucked in a wisp of air.

‚ÄúNOTH-ING,‚Äù I managed to sputter as absolute panic set in. I thought I was dying, suffocating, best case scenario in an ambulance- yet still... deny, deny, deny. Some instincts....

‚ÄúRaoul, you overdosed. We can still see the white powder in your nose.‚Äù

‚ÄúI *wheeze* DIDNT *wheeze* NOTHING.‚Äù It was still impossibly difficult to breathe, and I couldn‚Äôt see.

‚ÄúRaoul, you weren‚Äôt breathing. Your face was blue. We need to know what you took and how much you took.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt see. My arms and legs were numb, but I could tell they were strapped down as I began to regain feeling in my fingers and toes. Breathing started to become slightly easier, however it was still an involuntary task- i had to force myself to breath. It started to dawn on me- I had finally done it.  I had finally OD‚Äôd. I was in an ambulance and would shortly be in a jail hospital.

‚ÄúXANAX,‚Äù I wheezed in a panic. I had a prescription for Xanax, and my oxygen starved brain thought I could trick them into thinking that was all I had taken.

Fact was, according to the last thing I remember, the three of us were waiting at a bus stop for a 3rd mobile dealer after the first two fell through (imagine that). I was a ball of anxiety drenched in sweat on a chilly fall day, and my pupils were so dilated you could see into my soul if it weren‚Äôt for the dopesick tears flowing out of my eyes. 

Chances of copping anytime soon were looking grimmer by the second, so I popped the emergency 2mg Xanax bar I always keep on me. I‚Äôve got a prescription(read: tolerance). Didn‚Äôt know how long this was going to take, and I needed anything to take the edge off. You know that exact feeling.

I had copped from this dude before with no out of the ordinary issues, but he was the paranoid type- something was always off with him. I chalked it up to the the fact that I was the only white person for miles on the southside of a very large city known prominently for drugs and violence. I stood out. Literally everyone knew why I was there, and literally nobody cared.

After what seemed days, my buddy got the call. He‚Äôs an old head, black dude, so they trust him. I‚Äôll throw him a bag to cop for me so I don‚Äôt have to get in and out of a car or deal with stone cold killers face to face. Plus he‚Äôs got connections- he grew up in that neighborhood. It‚Äôs worth it.

Finally- glory! It was here! That feeling when he dropped the bags into my hand- I don‚Äôt have to describe the excitement because you know exactly the feeling I speak of. I was feeling generous after the ordeal and we were both sick as snot, so I rolled up a dollar bill popped open a bag of fluffy white powder and split it with him while we walked. 

Sweet relief.

We went our separate ways and I busted out another bag as I was walking towards the train. I always have a bag on my walk to the train to get me well. I put that up my nose with no problem- in fact it was amazing. One of the best tasting bags ever. You know how the sicker you are, the better it is when you finally do get right? Or how the best high in the world is after giving up hope because the odds of it coming thru are one and a million... and then it *actually* does? Those feelings multiplied by each other with some Xanax sprinkled on top.

I was at the point tolerance wise where i was copping 10 bags at a time, and one was just enough to normalize me. 10 would be gone in a day if I had money. I wasn‚Äôt worried about that half bag we split. Or the 2mg of Xanax I had taken. Or the last-resort-shady-dealer who provides the white powder (pretty common in this area).*Why the fuck would I have a single worry at all- I had 10 bags in my hand!!!!!!*

I made quick work of the bag. Bill rolled up, inside bag, inside palm of my hand and walking through city traffic nobody bats an eye. Makes me confident as ever- even cocky. And just as I‚Äôm walking around the corner..... I wake up in an ambulance with super glue in my lungs, suffocating........

‚ÄúRAOUL, can you hear me? Xanax and what else? I NEED to know what you took and HOW MUCH you took.‚Äù

My breath was slowing coming back but i could still feel my lungs touching. I had no concept of time. I was literally fighting to breath. The rest of my body was still numb and I couldn‚Äôt see.

‚ÄúI CANT GO BACK TO JAIL,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna go to jail we just need to know how much you took. We are trying to save your life.‚Äù

‚ÄúI CANT *wheeze* GO BACK TO JAIL!‚Äù

Rinse and repeat. I went back and forth with the EMTs like this for the entire ride. I finally regained feeling in my hand and checked my jean pocket- the 9 bags were gone.

They wheeled me into the hospital and my vision was starting to come back. I refused to give them any personal information. I refused treatment. They had a police officer put on gloves and give me a *very* reluctant ‚Äúpat down.‚Äù

I was taken aback at how quick and light the pat down was. 5 seconds long, just a quick pat on the belt loop and shoulders. I was wearing a teeshirt and no belt.... I‚Äôve had tighter security going into concerts. At this point I was starting to realize there MIGHT be a chance I wasn‚Äôt going to jail.

I kept asking if I was free to go. They said yes but naturally they didn‚Äôt recommend it and used all the words they could to keep me there. I did agree to wait for the doctor to come by. He did, and Doc told me I had stopped breathing, turned blue and had technically died. He told me if I refused to stay there I was going to go back out there and kill myself. 

Doc told me I didn‚Äôt know how lucky I was.  I didn‚Äôt know how lucky I was, because the thought that went through my head was, oh-so-familiar- *I‚Äôm a heroin addict. I‚Äôm invincible.* Get me the fuck out of here. That was my thought process- sound familiar? My ungrateful ass had fulfilled my duty to speak with the doctor and decided it was time to haul ass before they changed their mind. So i started to scoot out of the hospital bed.

At that moment I realized why the cop barely searched me (besides the fact they already had my dope). I had full blown shit myself. Like a hot milkshake spread all over my both my asscheeks. I felt it spread as I squished out of the hospital bed. The smell- you can only imagine.  I don‚Äôt know if you can imagine. No cop wants to deal with dope fiend OD shit in their cruiser.

One bathroom, one industrial roll of toilet paper, one bottle of hand sanitizer one hour and negative 1 pair of underwear and I was out of there. 

While still on hospital grounds I called my middle man, ‚ÄúWhere you at? Yeah im still high. High as fuck. But I just went through some SHIT and I need a few more bags to be on the safe side- I‚Äôm not trying to get sick.‚Äù

I had no idea if the Narcan was gonna kick in later or if it had run it‚Äôs course. All I knew was I had a date that night I couldn‚Äôt miss so I couldn‚Äôt risk getting sick. I copped 4 more bags from my regular guy and ended up puking every hour for the rest of the night- with my angel of a date who thought I was just regular sick. I thought it was the Narcan at the time, but I‚Äôm guessing Narcan didn‚Äôt rip the all the fent off my brain so I was still high and Unnecessarily sniffing more powder. Or it could have been my body recovering from (possible) death.

I genuinely don‚Äôt know how lucky I was. I don‚Äôt feel lucky- I‚Äôm still a heroin addict.

End of story.


***Serious question- in your opinion/experiences- do you think I really died or was that a scare tactic they used on me? It‚Äôs all pretty hazy besides the details I outlined above which are pretty vivid memories.  I don‚Äôt remember falling out. The xanax bar plus he hot bag was what did me in. If I wasn‚Äôt in a busy metropolitan city in the midst of an opioid epidemic I‚Äôm certain I would be dead. I just don‚Äôt know if I actually died. What do you guys think? Stay safe!

Please excuse any format/grammar/spelling issues- i typed this all on mobile and didn‚Äôt go back for a proof read. 

Morale of the story- DO NOT MIX BENZOS AND OPIATES and ALWAYS START SMALL TO TEST YOUR BATCH! LIVE BY THIS RULE AND YOU MAY CONTINUE TO LIVE!!!! STAY SAFE!!!!!!!

This post is mainly to just say hello to the community, and because I am a PM patient now this seems like a good place to get acquainted with. The only question that I have is for any PM patients that have been in PM for an extended period of time and have taken their medications as prescribed. Have you have any serious or noticeable medical issues resulting from directly taking these medications. Thank you. Just always worry about Tylenol and such because it is not natural. ",1533187561.0

GHB is liquid: .2g/ML. Total intake so far around 10-12 ML, and minimal effects.

There‚Äôs a second person with no opioid use, but regularly takes gabapentanoids like Lyrica, and formerly abused Phenibut. This person takes benzos daily and has been weaning down from n2mg klonopin daily. Did not dose klonopin prior to taking GHB and has had 15 ML with no noticeable effects. 


Re-dosing likely. Seeking advice for either person. If you have knowledge of this subject any harm reduction tips would mean a lot. Is there a safe way to potentiate GHB?

And yes I was getting high quality black. Also keep in mind that I wasn't an IV user of either. I'd snort oxies (smoking them is a rediculous waste imo even though it does feel great but only lasts 30 minutes as opposed to snorting which lasts about 4 hours) and smoke the h. I did have one friend that says he preferred oxies and hydros to smoking h. BUT he would say that tar is only truly euphoric for him if iv'd and he did prefer that to the other opiates.




Oxies gave me much more euphoria and I loved the energy aspect to it. I started smoking black tar once I couldn't afford 15 Roxie's a day. Smoking the tar literally gave me almost no euphoria. Why is this? I'm the only one I know that preferred oxys. I'd of much rather crushed up 4 or 5 Roxie's to snort than smoke .2-.3 of black. What are your opinions about this?




One more question..  Is China white heroin or fentanyl? Seems to be a lot of confusion on that for me. I did try iv'd China white only once and I honestly wasn't impressed. Maybe the quality was low or it could have been because I was tweaking at the time I tried this, so maybe that took away from it?

Throw away cus people know my username.

I have been using opiates off and on since I was 15 and have just turned 19. I've come to this sub tons of time for advice and learned everything about opiates and more importantly harm reduction from you guys. For a long time you guys were my only people to talk to about this shit. I got started the same way lots of people do, had a surgery and it was just codeine, but I'm the type of person who just wants to get fucked up, but was too scared to get actual drugs I guess. Opiates were my first drug and I loved them instantly. Once I used up my supply I thought that was that but you guys know how it goes. Another surgery, a family member, old pills, all that good stuff. I never used enough to get physically addicted, I typically used for a few weeks in a row just on weekends with month or two long breaks in between. Still, I was psychologically addicted and that's enough. I eventually started to use a bit more, buying pills now, getting high on weekends and it got harder to keep it that way. I began getting depressed on days that I wasn't getting high and quit for a bit, but the depression lasted. I hadn't used that much, I had been taking methadone to get high 2 times a week for 2 months when I was 16, never building up any tolerance but still being an addict in my own way. I was still depressed after a few months and ended up taking oxy after getting my wisdom teeth out. By now only my closest friends knew and only because I told them. This had stayed hidden from my family and anyone I didn't want to know. I was alone, none of them had ever touched anything so while they were kind, they didn't really get it. After another short break I needed more, but all I could find was heroin. So I took the plunge. I bought heroin and started snorting it. It was only half a gram but I had developed little to no tolerance due to how often I took breaks (30mg of Oxy still got me where I wanted to be). I only ever bought it once because I realized what was happening. I was up one night high for the third night in a row when I saw what was going on. I was watching Bojack and >!Sarah Lin died!<. The scene just hit me so hard. I realized that this was my last chance. If I didn't stop right now, this second, shit would end up outside of my control. It was just this moment of clarity and I just knew I had to stop. So I flushed what I had left (about a third of the half gram) and quit right there and then. I was 17 at this point and it was October.

Right after quitting was hard. Really hard. I wanted to give up but I stuck through it. I didn't even have physical withdraws but I still craved it everyday. After a month it seemed like the universe decided I was worthy. I met my girlfriend. She is my first girlfriend and we're still together today. She helped me so much. If I didn't have her I would have certainly relapsed. I literally thought about how if we broke up it would be OK because I could finally have heroin again. But she got me past that point. She took care of me and helped me and eventually I no longer wanted heroin. I knew that if I even had it in my face I could say no. It was great. We have/had our issues. I helped her with her own mental health (not drug related) and things were good. In July my dad had back pain. My family never knew about my addiction. I kept it hidden from them and they knew nothing. So when he kept a bottle of hydros on the counter it seemed perfectly fine. Why would he need to put them where it was a pain to get to ya know? For the first 2 weeks I was ok. My girlfriend talked me though things and I was ok. Eventually it got harder. It's one thing to say no once, or twice, or for a week. But everyday gets too hard. Moving the pills didn't help, they had been in my mind for too long. I was getting too taxing on my GF. And so I relapsed. I got high and my family noticed the missing pills. They had finally found out. They were devastated. I ended up telling them about the past and they were crushed. My gf was devastated. She ended up self harming for the first time and that started a battle for her that she is still struggling with. I can never forget how badly I hurt the people I care about the most. How my family was shocked. My gf looked like she was at deaths door. It was so horrible. And it makes me so mad at myself. If I had quit heroin just like that I would have been proud of stopping. It was on my own terms and I did because I decided to. I would be almost 2 years sober today instead of just now hitting 1. This is just a reminder of the day I got too weak and hurt the people I love. They don't blame me anymore, but I still blame me. I can't be proud of this no matter how badly I want to be. Idk if anyone else goes through shit like this, ik my situation is no where near as bad as most peoples but it still sucks and I feel like you guys are the only people who can really understand.

She‚Äôd been nodded out until we got to northern Alabama. Once we stopped there, she made me buy obscene amounts of candy and soda. She also asked me to check the oil when I put gas in, but she stayed in the car. There was barely any oil on the dipstick. What was there was black like coffee left on a hot pot all day. It looked chunky. I said,

‚ÄúYeah. It looks great, baby,‚Äù from under the hood. I was about finished with her anyway. I could feel the monster trying to claw himself free from the box inside of my brain. She wouldn‚Äôt fair well, if he got out, and she pulled the things she did. Anyway, it wouldn‚Äôt matter once I got away from her whether the car had oil or not. That would be her problem.

After driving 13 hours Gabriella and I spent the night in a hotel on the coast of Alabama. I rented the room at the office and opened it for her. The day had gone well. Of course, there was the typical bickering. She was always good for that. In the room, there wasn‚Äôt much heroin left, and since I hadn‚Äôt gotten a habit going since I relapsed with her, I let her have it. I was just happy to be out of Ohio where no one was watching the news that offered a reward for information leading to my arrest.

The blue and green flicker of the TV glowed through the curtains in our room. I sat on the beach in the moonlight and listened to the surf breaking on the sand and thought about Oregon and Arizona. I had never been to either state and both had cities where the street life was happening, or so I‚Äôd heard. Arizona would be warmer and drier. Oregon had a certain pull on me, even though it would be wet and cold. It was a place I‚Äôd wanted to go since I was a kid. Both had plenty of heroin according to all reports I ever got.

The prospect of leaving her and going back to the streets put a warm lump of hope or nostalgia or something sentimental, and I walked back to the room. She was sleeping when I opened the door. A movie played on HBO. I fell asleep quickly.

Now, I don‚Äôt know where she got the clothes iron, but she did. She may have brought it. It may have been a part of the room. I‚Äôm not sure about where it came from. I just know that the distinct sound of my own skin‚Äôs moisture popping against the hot metal held to my forehead woke me up that morning. Gabriella was up. We had no connections in Alabama. I‚Äôd lied about Florida. So, she burned me with the iron. I can‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt expected, or at least something like it.

I pulled my pants on. I ran for the door. Rain fell in freezing drops the size of grapes from the sky and a wind ripped up the street as I walked faster. Everything with her and leaving my sister and being so weak caught up to me, and as hard as I fought it, I cried. I bawled in the rain walking down the street in just my jeans. A car pulled up behind me and then slowly creeped along with me. Maybe they would help. Maybe they‚Äôd have an answer or ask me to get in and take me far away from my life and myself and everything else I hated so much and couldn‚Äôt figure out, but when I turned towards them, a middle-aged man with a crew cut leaned over the steering wheel to see past his wife, who was gawking from the passenger seat. A child pointed and smiled from the back. I moaned pathetically and reached out towards them and stumbled to put my face to the window and beg for their help.  It was as if I could sense their humanity bubbling up within their chests so that they would, so that they must help this pitiful, half naked creature crying like a child in the freezing rain -- me.

My senses must have been wrong, though. The mother reached back to hide the child‚Äôs eyes from seeing me, and the engine revved. Tail pipe blasted smog at my face. Tires splashed cold gutter water all over me. I cried harder and decided to walk back to the hotel. At least there, I would be able to sit on the balcony outside of the room where it was dry. Maybe Gabriella would let me in.

The curtains were closed. The lights were off from what I could tell. It looked like no one was in the room when I got back. I leaned over the railing and let my tear drops fall to the pavement below. A one-story drop wouldn‚Äôt even break my legs, maybe sprain an ankle, but there was no way I could expect the fall to kill me. Then, I looked towards the sea. I‚Äôve never been a very good swimmer. The storm had caused the waves to break violently against the shore. All I would have to do is swim towards the horizon for as long as I could. There was no way I would be able to make it back.

Before I could make the stairs, a pair of young black men wearing torn white tshirts on their heads like bandanas met me as they were coming out of their room. They took one look at me and asked,

‚ÄúWhatsa poblem? Why you cryin‚Äô? You a mon. Don‚Äô cry.‚Äù

They asked me if I was a ‚ÄúJesus person.‚Äù They asked me if I liked ‚Äúda Boy.‚Äù Both questions confused me, but soon I got it figured out. The answers were no and yes respectively.

I said, ‚ÄúNo. Not a Jesus person. Yes. I like da boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome in. You have money.‚Äù I think it was a question, like he was asking if I had money. It just didn‚Äôt sound like one. And I did have money.

In the room, they sat me in a chair at the small table against the wall and produced a brittle, brown brick the size of a wallet. They cut a bit off and put it on the table. I couldn‚Äôt even see what they‚Äôd given me, but I trusted it was there and put my nose to it and snorted. My eyes watered. I got queasy.

‚ÄúYou like dat mon.‚Äù It was supposed to be another question. I nodded and stumbled towards the door and puked over the balcony. They didn‚Äôt ask for any money. They just said they‚Äôd be there if I wanted more.

I woke up covered in the white beach sand grit. An angry Gabriella was standing over me. It was getting dark and had quit raining at some point. All I could remember, though, were the two Jamaicans or Haitians or whoever they were pulling me into their room. Gabriella said I needed to go pay for another night. She‚Äôd been locked out and looking for me all day, so she said. I could tell by her voice that she‚Äôd gotten something somewhere. Maybe all the dope she didn‚Äôt do or share with me from the day before. I don‚Äôt know.

The next morning started off better. It was sunny and warmer. She didn‚Äôt wake me up by burning the skin off my face or turn any other appliances into medieval torture devices. She hadn‚Äôt started a fight, even. We went to breakfast at a diner down the street. I wore a pair of cheap aviators I‚Äôd stolen from a gas station a few days before. In my mind, somehow, the glasses were a disguise to keep people from noticing the piece of burned flesh on my forehead, hanging off like a gnarly piece of dried out pepperoni, all curled up and black and green and crusty. It didn‚Äôt work. The glasses only covered my eyes. I knew that. The waitress and anyone else who saw me that morning did a double take and stared awkwardly at it when they talked to me. A fatter man and his pretty wife at another table gave me a look of understanding, like he knew exactly what had happened when he saw it. It made me feel better though, to wear the glasses. So, I did.

When we got back to the room, the two men I‚Äôd seen the day before were standing outside of the room. Gabriella was wearing those gym shorts that must have belonged to a skinny 8th grader, and they choked her thighs and butt in a way that made it hard for men not to look. One man slapped the other‚Äôs shoulder and pointed at her as we entered the room. Inside of the room, she asked me where we could score.

‚ÄúI know you were high yesterday, Clyde.‚Äù

I told her to wait in the room and went back to the other room. The two men were standing outside waiting for me. There were 50 bucks left in my pocket, and they gave me a generous portion of the fuzzy looking granules in three gel caps for it. That was the last of the money.

‚ÄúHey, mon, we like you chick.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt know here well enough, then, mon.‚Äù I laughed, trying to do my best islander accent. They didn‚Äôt understand.

‚ÄúWe pay. We take her. Our boat comes at sunrise, tomorrow.‚Äù They didn‚Äôt want her for the night. I‚Äôd never had a chick like that long enough to let one pay for our dope that way anyway, but they wanted something more permanent.

‚ÄúLet me think about it. I‚Äôll come see you later.‚Äù

The truth is that I would have never sold Gabriella to the Haitians or Jamaicans or whatever they were. She was terrible to me. The last two or three days, though, were good. Well, they were okay, and you‚Äôd have to forget about the incident with the iron to say that. Something inside of me loved her still. Something inside of me wanted to make it work with her and held onto the moments when she was just a little less crappy so that it could work. Maybe, I was just weak. Anyone else would have left her. I never would have. There‚Äôs no question about it, but Boom Boom on the other hand, well, he‚Äôs a different story.

She did most of the dope in the capsules. I only did a little and got sick. Gabriella woke me up in the middle of the night. She was naked and sweet and sweating soon after that. We had fun. We shared a cigarette in bed, glistening in the dark and blew smoke at the ceiling. She started a shower. *This was it.* I thought. *This was love.* She was not who she‚Äôd been, really. I‚Äôd finally found it, the thing called love, that I‚Äôd so desperately pined for. My mother was all I had ever known of it, and she was gone. A warm spring of hope and happiness babbled in my chest. Angels were singing. This was love, but in the shower, she farted in my mouth, again. She even laughed, like it was cute.

Now, it‚Äôs always difficult explaining the whole Boom Boom thing to people, because obviously, he and I exist in the same body. It‚Äôs just not clear exactly where the line is drawn. There are somethings about Clyde, that are the same about Boom Boom. So, maybe, it‚Äôs not necessarily two distinct personalities but severely altered versions of the same person. Like I said, it‚Äôs difficult to explain, and it‚Äôs also difficult to know exactly when the line is crossed from Clyde to Boom Boom or Boom Boom to Clyde. I just know it was some time after she farted in my mouth in the shower and laughed.

She watched TV. I told her I‚Äôd be back with some more heroin and went to visit the men. They were up. The payment filled a cigarette cellophane so fully that when I melted it shut at the top with my lighter, some of the dope got melted into it. I wrapped it in a napkin for safety, deciding to revisit the packaging situation once Gabriella was gone.

‚ÄúBabes, look what they gave me!‚Äù

‚ÄúWHAT! No way!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. The guys are just a few doors down. They say they want to meet you personally. I gotta take a dump, though, so just go on over. You‚Äôll see ‚Äòem. Their door is open.‚Äù Those were the last words I ever spoke to her.

As the sun came up, I sat on the balcony. It was beautiful. I had walked to the 24-hour grocery store and bought a six pack of root beer in glass bottles. It was for the toast. You know, I would stick a needle in my veins with the most poisonous chemical concoctions you could dream up, if it would get me off, but I hated alcohol.

Their door opened. It looked like Gabriella was lethargic from whatever drugs she‚Äôd done with them, but it was hard to tell. She had a pillowcase over her head and duct tape around her neck. Her hands were bound behind her back, and the men were strong besides. She didn‚Äôt give much fight physically, but for a few kicks here and there. I could hear her muffled screams. I imagined she was saying my name.

There was a buzzing in the distance getting louder and closer all the time. Eventually, a rickety long boat made of what looked like trash pushed onto the shore from the water. The men took Gabriella, gagged and bound, over their shoulders and into the boat. I lifted my bottle of root beer to the men. They waved back, and the driver let off his horn. That was our toast.

I don‚Äôt know whatever happened to her. Maybe, she lives still in some Haitian rape dungeon. Maybe, she was chopped up into pieces and sold for the price of her organs. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt care, but I do know that I remembered that notebook with the stories in it, as the boat road off into the vast expanse of the see. It was in the car, so I went to get it.

I opened it on the hood and let the sun warm my neck and head as I read the last story in it. My palms were on the car and fingers splayed. It was called, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never see that house again.‚Äù Whoever wrote it must have written it about their grandmother and her house. It went like this.

*I‚Äôll never see that house again.*

*And I won‚Äôt see her either.*

*We spent every summer there and, in the mornings, she cooked pancakes in bacon grease from a mason jar or biscuits and sausage with strawberry preserves. We drank cold milk from the plastic cups from the shelf under her set of olive-green colony glass tea tumblers she‚Äôd had since the 1970s.*

*We watched cartoons with older cousins after breakfast or made tree forts anywhere on the five acres she kept sequestered from the new neighborhoods and traffic with trees and brush. There was a club house on the side of the garden in the field. It had windows and a door. It was where our uncle molested us.*

*It was where my own father grew up, way back when the road was only one lane and made of gravel. He told me the front yard had been a dense, dark forest of cane when he was a kid. That was hard to believe. He told me the day he came home from the hospital, the pipes froze at the house and his head had been mangled by the forceps they used to deliver him. ‚ÄúI always wondered what my daddy thought that day,‚Äù he used to tell me, not that he remembered it, but he knew the story. ‚ÄúI always wondered what my daddy thought, coming home from the hospital, his son looking like some purple, smashed face monkey with a busted head and ice all over the kitchen floor.‚Äù Things had been different then.*

*My grandmother cut her own field until the day she broke her leg. She slipped on a clip from a clothes hanger at the department store looking for a deal. It was the end of her. Physical therapy had been too much. She never got out of the wheelchair. Eventually, one of her eyes went caddywompas‚Äîin her own words‚Äîmeaning it went sideways while the other looked straight. We suspected it was from all the Tab she drank in the 1980s. Too much aspartame.*

*She was known to cry over nothing. Once she started weeping at the kitchen sink, because there was an airplane in the sky out the window and the people inside of it had just said goodbye to all the people they loved before boarding. Her face was as ugly as a face can get when it came to crying.*

*She liked to say, ‚ÄúWell, ain‚Äôt that a bunch of sh\*t.‚Äù It usually was.*

*She accused people of ‚Äúflim flamming her.‚Äù They usually were.*

*She accused the grandkids of always being one step ahead of her. We definitely were.*

*She used to sip Diet Coke from a glass and chew ice cubes or a toothpick when she sat on her love seat next to a pile of outdated tabloids. She sowed all the curtains in the house, in the 60s. She told me how she‚Äôd set the kitchen on fire once and how the finish on the cabinets wasn‚Äôt the original. It had all been burned off in the fire.*

*She died though. Rolled that wheel chair to the end of her long hallway, crawled into bed and died.*

*Was it cold?*

*Was she scared?*

*Did she cry out or did something visit her when it happened?*

*Now, her children are selling the property and house. It‚Äôs five acres. A strange redhaired couple with an Indonesian financer came to look at it. They wore collared shirts that had emblems of two triangles and the letter S running through them. The place will be sold to Scientologists. It will be one of their compounds.*

*I can see her now, sitting on her love chair and looking up from the paper to say, ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt that a bunch of sh\*t?‚Äù*

*I'll never see her again, though.*

*And I won't see that house, either.*

When I finished the story, I turned around and fell back onto the hood of the car. A skinny blond woman in flip flops and shorts with a large, Fleur delis tattoo on her shoulder and a red skinned, kinky haired baby in her arms asked me for a cigarette.

‚ÄúSure. They‚Äôre in my room, though. You‚Äôll have to follow me.‚Äù

‚ÄúK.‚Äù She waited outside of the door. Her eye was swollen shut and turning a shiny greenish black color. ‚ÄúAre you leaving town?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere you going?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you take me with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. I need it. What‚Äôs your name anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is‚Ä¶..‚Äù I was about to say Clyde, but I adjusted, ‚ÄúYou can call me Boom Boom.‚Äù",1533179385.0

TL;DR: AT the bottom. 

It took me so many months to finally schedule this test at $30 a test, 4 test and I‚Äôm finally taking my second ones. I‚Äôm going through a lot of arguing in my relationship all week (7 days for sure) and the test is tomorrow and she is aware and stress is my biggest distraction *when it comes to people I love. Especially when they take up all my hours of my days talking about suicide and had to stop an attempt this morning*

That being said, I‚Äôm afraid to sleep home with my partner (I‚Äôm male, she‚Äôs female probably doesn‚Äôt matter gender), I would feel less stressed and safer being over my cousins but my girlfriend will get spite and mean if I even mention walking to the corner store for water even with 90+ days free of opiates except last night because I couldn‚Äôt cope with the hours of stress she put on me and stopping a suicide attempt that triggered my PTSD of dead parents from suicide and tried my hardest to cope and it took over completely.

So I‚Äôm off my Suboxone for 3 days now I believe and I relapsed yesterday. This test is so important to me because without a GED, no military for me. Or any college that I could afford.

Having took 450mg morphine ER chewed last night with 2mg Pharmacy Xanax and didn‚Äôt even feel it kick in until I was sleeping, basically, and upon awakening because I slept in an opiate position with severe shoulder pain and stuff in my mouth like I threw up in my sleep (thankful I didn‚Äôt die) and Suboxone not blocking my receptors. Basically took 180mg morph. First then the remaining 270mg morph at night, confused why I didn‚Äôt feel it as strong.

Also will mention in the TL;DR below all the meds I have access to that may help. 

*TL;DR: Finally scheduled GED tests to get into military/college, girlfriend of 5 years I love and live with being controlling and extremely stressed. Had over 90+ days clean from opiates/drugs except Suboxone my maintenance med until last night, seeing her attempt suicide triggered me and relapsed of 450mg oral morphine. I really need to past this test tomorrow and I need peaceful sleep, little to no stress so I can focus and my cousins house offers me that, but my girl practically doesn‚Äôt let me leave the house at all and I‚Äôm always with her and got off Oxy/Morphine for her ‚Äîall after both partners dying and I‚Äôm now 20. I need to take an opioid to focus such as Oxycodone that I can acquire but all I have is buprenorphine (Suboxone). Here‚Äôs meds below that I have and I need advice about this whole sleeping out stress free when communication failed please thank you.*

I have: At least x30 Valium 2mg 
I don‚Äôt exceed 10-20mg 

x12 Adderall 20mg IR (I don‚Äôt abuse)
I Only take 1 tablet 

Over x60 Klonopin 1mg 
(I won‚Äôt exceed 2mg)

x10 real/pharmaceutical made 
Xanax 2mg (I only take for emergencies)

x12 Suboxone tablet 8/2mg
(Was only taking 2mg twice daily)


*Will morphine, buprenorphine, Oxycodone or hydrocodone help me focus more and what dosage to not nod off? And take with or without my Adderall?*

ALL of your advice on ALL of this will help me out so much for not only tomorrow‚Äôs test but the other 2 in following weeks!!!!!!!",1533178599.0

He had a girlfriend or a wife, and would occasionaly go to work, that is, pilote planes on heroin. He used to just snort and didn't take too much before work, just enough to be well, since he couldn't work high without risking a plane crash. In this particular day, he decided to wrap the dope on foil and take it with him in his pocket or in his hand baggage. What he really wanted was to make the flight and then go to his hotel to get high.

What could go wrong, uh? After all, airplane pilots were searched or supervised rarely, only a few times. Well, that day ended up being on one of those rare occasions in which pilots are checked.

The dope on foil was found and his excuse was that that was vitamin powder. He said he couldn't take the vitamin capsules for some reason that I'm not sure, so his doctor told him to take the vitamin powder off the capsules and take just the powder. Agents were called and started interrogating him to see if he would contradict himself in his excuse. He was trained to go through situations of tension and pression, so he would answear fast and never contradicted anything he already mentioned before. The agents thought the H was crack (???), and after much tension he was dispensed. He had gotten away!

So he was relieved and decided to make this reddit post telling us this story with an alternate account, since he commented on flight/ plane/ pilots subs though his main account. When he was answearing the comments, that motherfuker accidentally entered his original main account to comment, so then we ""knew"" who this guy was and he could be caught more easily. Fucking nuts!

I remember there were people in the comments telling him he would be soon tested for drugs, so that he should detox. There were people saying it was stupid for him to do that post. And there were people shocked that there are pilots out there piloting planes on heroin. I understand the people who were shocked, but I guess if he was doing only enough to get well before work, not actually flying planes high on dope, well, that may not be the ideal situation, but it's better than him flying planes while withdrawling. Talk about a crazy story. It didn't take long for him to delete the post. Anyone else remember this? Please tell me I'm not the only one who remember that post!",1533169739.0

---


My first encounter with heroin was age 10

I wrote a song for my band, picked up my pad and with my pen

I scribbled ""chasing the dragon"" at the top of the page

Wanted to be famous, wanted to get up on that stage

Wanted to speak of things I'd never played with before

Wanted to get into to the game, wanted to go on tour

When I was twelve I learned my brother was in jail

Five years, cocaine, tried to be Escobar but failed

By that point two years I knew I was destined

Obsessed with coke cause drugs are interesting

Learned about ozzy osbourne and his special predilection

School was easy, grades were good

But the temptation was festering




It's easy to look at someone and say it's your fault

But do we really deserve the pain and the insult?

We all fucking know we're not good role models

And with the gamble and the money it's like playing the lotto

When misguided youth turn to using the needle

Don't treat em like animals, cause we're all still people




The first drug I tried was an XR Adderall

Turned eleven and couldn't give a single fuck at all

At school, sold my best friend a bag of Tylenol

Charged 20 dollars and spent the money at the mall

Next day I'm approached, and I'm thinking ""oh fuck""

He said ""man, the high was good, but the taste, it sucks""

I told him, ""I know, the expensive coke is better.""

For years I followed that scheme to the letter

Then one day, teenage, I tried a bag of coke

Fast forward a month later, I was sniffing dope

Selling bags of ice to fiends and bumming packs of smokes

Not old enough to drive, on the weekends I blew meth smoke,

I thought: man, life is so much better when you're nodding and getting high 

Had the needle in my arm when tolerance multiplied




It's easy to look at someone and say it's your fault

But do we really deserve the pain and the insult?

We all fucking know we're not good role models

And with the gamble and the money it's like playing the lotto

When misguided youth turn to using the needle

Don't treat em like animals, cause we're all still people




I bet you still think that I wanted this for myself

That I wanted to care about drugs over my health 

That's why society is fucked, we're still fucking people,

We're not drug addicts all because we're fucking evil,

It's not true, I swear I'm the sweetest fucking person,

Yall looking at me like my hobby is committing arson,

And I'm supposed to be cool with that, it's fine?

I'm the scum of the earth because I liked being high?

Fuck that, take a look at your own fucking parents,

It's not okay because drinking's where the cash's spent,

So back it up before you cast the first stone,

I'm sure you have some sins for which you should atone.

So I got pretty addicted back in 2015ish. Got on buprenorphine slowly tapered down from 4mg to 0.6mg a day. Recently, a few months ago, I was put on weekly pick ups. Was great at first but I've been struggling with taking my doses daily and not snorting doses to get that meagre ""high"". It's sort of culminated in me using (oral morphine) again ""just to get through"" to when I can pick up my weekly allowance of buprenorphine. For what it's worth I'm aware of how much of a dickhead I am, and I'm gonna quit my bullshit and start taking the buprenoprhine I'm prescribed properly from tomorrow, when I pick up my weekly allowance.

I'm aware that buprenorphine can block full agonists. I last took buprenorphine yesterday, 0.4mg snorted. I thought at such a low dose I wouldn't notice much blocking. When I first took the morphine today I felt that really heavy feeling in my arms and legs, and my nose and eyes dried up, stomach settled down, etc. Even a little euphoria, or at least physical pleasure. But subsequent redoses seem to have had no effect, even to the point where I feel like I'm in withdrawals now. Is this normal? Why would I be in withdrawals if I keep redosing morphine? Can the buprenorphine block the full agonist from working but at the same time be too little to keep you out of withdrawals? I feel strange. I can feel the morphine working a little bit, but I also feel like I'm in withdrawals at the same time.

Should I take a .2mg buprenorphine to see what happens? I'm pretty scared of precipitated withdrawals, but if I feel like I'm in withdrawal it should be ok right? Or are those words I'm gonna regret? I'm leaning towards no because I can just about feel the effects of the morphine, but my back is aching like a mofo and I'm sweating for no reason... Just feel like I'm both slightly high and in withdrawals at the same time, it's very strange... 

I guess the lesson to learn would be don't fuck around when on maintenance meds.

93s2ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/93s2ru/life_is_alright_at_4am/,4,https://redd.it/93s2ru,sloan_fitch,Life is alright at 4am,"Last night just after 4am I was biking home from working on an ongoing project with a friend as well as viewing episodes of SG1. Mostly a quiet ride, I did not get a chance to watch a street resurfacer do it's thing as I did earlier that evening. I did however get to ride my bike over roughly stripped roads which will soon be paved over to complete the resurfacing process.

&nbsp;

Within the final half mile as I turned off a main thoroughfare onto a main sidestreet, I saw what appeared to a kid on a bike. What is a twelve year old doing riding a bicycle at 4am? Well, whatever.. he ain't a trickster or a showoff so at least I don't have to worry about being served. You know, like when someone break dances better than you and you have no comeback. That's what happens when someone pops a wheelie around me. It's not really my riding style and although I've done some tricky maneuvers on my bike that require  fancy foot work but usually only when it's practical to do so. Jump a curb, cut diagonally across a golf course and the occasional jaunt through the woods. 


&nbsp;


**The kid on the bike** was maintaining a steady velocity so I decided increase mine and pass on the left. As I was already three car lengths ahead and acclerating my name is called, ""hey sloansoid."" I look and I realize, that twelve year old on a bike is actually Derrick. He's small like that, mostly short. Actually has fair muscle tone, though Tim still believes he could beat the shit out of him but that's another story and a theory that will hopefully never be tested. You know, in the name of peace. 


&nbsp;


Being the courteous individual that I am, I slowed down and circled back. My velocity was so great that I had to do two 360s before Derrick had caught up with me. From there, I was practically coasting and still moving faster. It wasn't difficult but it took a concious effort to brake and match his velocity. Wonder why he was out biking at 4am?


&nbsp;


**It became abundantly clean when** he pointed at it was Tuesday at at 4am. Well, technically Wednesday but the new day starts when I wake up as far as I'm concerned. What happens at 4am on Wednesdays? Cliff or his mom gets paid. I'm not really sure who's pay day it is since it all goes to the same account in his mom's name. For all I know all of the money is due for her and Cliff is making up the existence of his monthly disability money. When we used to hang out he would refer to one of his monthly direct deposits as ""big money"", such as ""Wednesday is my big money day."" An example being, ""Do you have $40 I can borrow, I got you next Wednesday, that's when I get my big money.""


&nbsp;


**What is abundantly clear?** Derrick was biking on his way back from the ATM with Cliff's card and money. The next phase of the operation for him was to meet up with his plug. We parted ways at the corner, I took the slightly more scenic route home in order ensure that I did not stumble into Cliff. Before parting ways I wished Derrick luck with timing - we all know what it can be like waiting for our respective plugs. When I got home I saw Derrick pulling into his driveway a few houses down - he must've stopped off at Cliff's on the way back to drop off the debit card or something. He often has to bike to the plug but if he was going home I suspect the plug was coming to him that night. 



&nbsp;

That last part doesn't really matter to me. I'm glad not being part of the equation anymore. Last few times I was involved for the 4am pick-up were factors in my choice to stop doing dope altogether. Even w hen I had used my own plugs, it was hard for me not to avail myself for a couple of free bags although I eventually concluded the price was too high for that benefit. There was always a ""gotcha"" or ""by the way"" when dealing with Cliff in what should be a simple endeavor. 



&nbsp;


Sometimes I'd hang out for four hours beforehand, but with the advent of bed bugs the couch became inhospitable. As the infestation got worse, even metal chairs at the kitchen table were no longer safe! I'd see the little buggers on my shirt and pick them off individually, I'd get home, strip down in my freezing backyard and hold my shirt up to the light to see a juvenile bug. I once hung out for four hours binging of Stargate Universe a series I never really watched prior. I watched soldiers in a desert while I wore my winter coat indoors. That very coat is still in my backyard, I've never taken it inside my home again since that night. 



&nbsp;

Without reflecting and recanting past events which I'm saving for another post, I am just glad. Just because Cliff would get paid at 4am didn't mean I'd have my dope by 5am. It always took longer for different reasons. On one occaisons Derrick told Cliff he wanted to stop at home on the way back, get straight and the deliver the dope wheras Cliff would demand delivery first. Derrick would argue that he put the effort in and should be entitled to that. Then there's the other fact, Cliff preferred Derrick to deliver all of the dope first so that he could select choose and distribute Derrick's earnings. 


&nbsp;


There was always a push-pull between Cliff and Derrick regarding timing and expectations. The results of which would inevitably funnel down to me. Seeing Derrick last night once again reminded me of how great it is not to depend on the whims of other individuals at 4am to get doep. I mean yeah, I still depend on the whims of other individuals but at least I have a greater sense of control since Suboxone is a longer acting opioid. If someone is two days late on delivery of goods during a busy work week - things no longer spiral rapidly out of control. None of that feeling anxiety, physically sick, the chills and that general sense of the lighting looking different because I ran out of my drug eighteen hours ago and have been getting strung along since. 


&nbsp;


Now, when I get strung along by a connect for subs I usually still have a few days of of medication and have been able to ration it further to make it last longer with great ease. As far as I'm concerned right now, even when I feel mopey - **la vita es bella.** 


&nbsp;



The flow has not ended, but further reflection and detail on things like the monthy 4am bike ride to the ATM shall be relegated to future post.

&nbsp;

#tl;dr: 

Saw Derrick the middle biking back from the ATM on Cliff's behest while I was on my way home from studying and gardening and watching TV sci-fi. It reminded me of how good life is now in comparison to a couple of months ago when it was hard to resist the opportunity to bike to the ATM for Cliff's fat ass in order to earn 20% of a single bundle in addition to buying myself some dope if I had the money. Cliff used to also sometimes extend me credit if I was broke but never 50% of the order as he used to expect from me. Doesn't matter now, just feels good to reflect on it instead of actively dealing with it.

We‚Äôre on subs, but I know his true love is coke. I was going through the baby bag & found 2 spoons & a lighter. Yes the baby plays with spoons, but he could never reach his bag. Then I found a spoon & lighter in MY suitcase!!! I KNOW I didn‚Äôt put it in there. I hear his texts go off but he always deletes them. I‚Äôm just at my wits end. I‚Äôm an addict so I know how it works. He will lie. And now that we have a baby, it just worries me. He NEVER answers his phone(when I call.) 

I just need confirmation or to catch him in the act. He takes a shower before & after work! This is causing me so much stress, I want to use. And now I‚Äôm far from my family, so I‚Äôm basically alone. Maybe count all the subs & see if he‚Äôs actually taking them?? I just need to know. And to wait until we move to do this?? After a baby?? He claims I‚Äôm paranoid, but I really don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs driving me insane.

EDIT:We just used our life savings to buy a house down here. No mortgage, we spent 145,000 & are fixing it up. But its all in my name. Everything, his truck, my car, the house. The ONLY thing that isn‚Äôt is his motorcycle. But I‚Äôm not a bitch. I won‚Äôt take it all even though I easily could. I just want him to stop & get help, but he won‚Äôt admit it. He‚Äôs freaking 50 years old. This is his ONLY child. But thats how addiction works. He‚Äôs gonna die at this point. I cry as I sit here typing this. And he knows theres no where for me to run to(aka my parents) since were so far. I texted him 20 mins ago telling him we HAVE to have a talk after the baby goes to bed. No response still.

Edit: I‚Äôd like to thank (almost) everyone on this sub. Everyone gave great advice & no one judged. I still have yet to confront him(I hate confrontation) but I‚Äôm like 99% sure. ",1533150853.0

Later i switched on to dope and ive been using for 4 years on and off (dont feel like telling my age)

Is this a common thing?,"Ok a couple weeks ago I met someone who told me she has a sugar daddy that spends rediculous amounts of money on her, pretty much everyday. 

This lady is probably in her late 40s, and is missing damn near every tooth.  She smokes hella crack and then goes to town on herself picking at her skin with a pair of tweezers.  To sum it up, she is no model and has alot of wear on her from the lifestyle.  

So as I get to work with her more, she tells me all kinds of things about her sugar daddy.  (She seems very proud of it)
-The guy is in his mid 80s, and can barely walk.
They have never had sex together and are not romantic
He leaves hours away and the only conversations they seem to have are this lady screaming demands into the phone at her man.

Ok so I hear from her that, family members of the man have been contacting this lady asking her to find someone else to cling onto. Her response, ""those bitches just want his money when he dies, but they aint gettin it""
-I guess she has got over $450,000!! In less than 2 years from this guy, and hearing that made me almost puke.  She made a off hand statement that she has depleted his entire retirement fund.

So to me this situation is pretty fucked up and sick.  This crack head old witch of a lady is draining some old mans retirement fund.  His family needs to get a power of attorney and get his banks to not allow the transactions.

This was my first exposure to the sugar daddy world.  Tho it seems way common around my area, just talking with female users in the last couple of weeks.

I say ""used to front."" Now, I don't owe him any money. I'm all paid up. So I ask if he'll spot me some. He said no. Said if I wanted to do a trade maybe we can work something out. 

Ok yeah. I'm thinking he needs one of the many things I have listed for sale. New tv maybe? Well shit yeah. That moneys going towards drugs anyway. 

""What kind of trade?""

...

""You know what kind""


Omg. NO! No. Holy shit. 

""I don't do that kinda stuff...""

""Ok then""

Unfortunately it then turned more into a psychedelic, can't escape your demons, pull out all your deepest issues and stab them in your eyes type thing. The first experience, I took my very last bit of H(probably around 20mg) first thing in the morning when I woke up. I had used 200mg the days and months before all intranasal. About 3 hours after that dose I started to feel the minor WD come on so I started popping 300mg gabas one at a time. I knew about spacing them apart an hour-2 to maximize absorption. About 6 hours and 900mg gabapentin later I'm feeling pretty damn alright... Great actually. Music's enhanced, really getting into TV shows. Also just walking around messing with/observing objects in my home and completing mundain tasks became extremely interesting, just as a lot of dissociative drugs make things look sort of new in a way. It was a great high I must say. But best of all no signs of WD whatsoever... Not even cravings. Around midnight or so I don't even remember past this point I popped like a half a Xanax. Next thing I know it's about 10 hours later and I'm waking up like sleeping beauty. That's the first thing that popped in my mind is God damn I slept well and I feel beautiful right now. I continued to have a fantastic after glow the entire day. Easiest day of running dry I every experienced..  

Now the next time, I did pretty much everything the same. Mind you I had started IV not too long ago which may have had a major impact. My dose increased from 200mg a day intranasal to about 200-300mg IV. I dosed the tiny bit of my stash around the same time, started popping gabas and about 4-5 hours in I get EXTREMELY.. extremely emotional. I'm sitting for what felt like hours washing cottons like 3-4 times each trying to get a fix but getting nothing. I broke down crying on the floor looking at the needle in my arm. I continued to cry countless times that night. It seemed as if I had been instantly smacked in the face with all of the demons that this comfy warm heroin blanket had been covering up. The experience was very psychedelic and dissociative in a sense that's hard to describe. I've tried many many many classes of drugs and none of those experiences ever came close this gabapentin one. Maybe DXM or MXE In terms of the general dissociation from body and mind.  But gabapentin is incredibly unique and I'd say it's very set and setting dependant. I'd describe my first experience as sort of a euphoric dissociative benzo if that makes sense. What I'd image GHB to be like(one of the few substances I haven't tried). I didn't have any trouble running dry or withdrawing whatsoever. I woke up the next day feeling like a new man. But something about the second experience changed everything very dramatically. The only thing that calmed my emotions for a bit was to take a hike and listen to music. It was very entertaining to stare at the trees, mountains, ground and general landscape very much as if I was on LSD. Same sort of very indrigued headspace as well. But after I got back home I was right back to balling my eyes out. No physical withdrawal symptoms but heavy heavy emotional issues. Didn't sleep nearly as good that night either.  

I'm am still very interested in Gabapentin and potentially Lyrica and hope to try it again. Hopefully not in opiate WD this time although I was blown away by the effectiveness the first time around. All I have to say is gabapentin is certainly one of the most interesting substances I've tried. I was expecting it to be a mild benzodiazapine, I was pretty fuckin far off.",1533126916.0

I don't mind not getting a positive feeling, just anything to let me know it is working. Should 5ml be noticeable in any way? So far I cannot notice any feeling whatsoever after taking two doses.

I‚Äôd never ever dreamed I‚Äôd ever touch Heroin. I‚Äôm 52 years old, grandma of four lil beauties who worship,the ground I walk on. In my 20‚Äô and 30‚Äôs I had and on and off problem with vicodins and Percs. Went to rehab, but always went back. 
. Then I was 
Prescribed suboxone 18 years ago. It finally started to cause severe health problems. Wanted off subs so badly. Found out about Kratom, got off subs successfully for 9 months using Kratom daily then tapered off Kratom. I was doing great!  Felt wonderful. Then for some reason my hemoglobin dropped to 6.2. Had several blood transfusions. Had zero energy, hard to breathe. Still undergoing tests to find out what‚Äôs causing internal bleeding that‚Äôs causing the anemia. 
I gained 50 pounds in less than a month. Literally felt like I was on my death bed. My family doc gave me 10 vicodins to help with the pain. They definitely helped my pain. I felt good enough to cook dinner for family that night.  Tried to get more Vic‚Äôs till my endoscopy was scheduled. Doc said sorry, no more. Things went down hill quick again. Started asking around for a few Vic‚Äôs. No one had any. BUT an old friend told me to try some heroin. No way was I going to inject. I just wanted a little pain relief. I snorted a very small amount. My ‚Äúfriend‚Äù assured me I had no danger of od‚Äôing if I only snorted it. I used approximately 1 gram in a week. with no major problem. 
I knew right away this H was different. It was a different color. I did the same amount I‚Äôd been doing and immediately got extreme chills. My faithful, unsuspecting husband said I was burning up. Told him I was getting the flu and going to lay down. He went out to mow grass. I had about a 1/2 gram left that I‚Äôd tucked under my bra.  
This is last thing I remember was getting in bed at 4:00 pm.  Then hearing my named screamed over and over by strangers and feeling like my entire body was being pulled downwards and felt like I was just supposed to keep going with whoever was pulling me down. But the people pulling me upwards knew my name and kept telling me to come back and stay with them. My family needed  me. They knew my grandkids names. But the terrifying imaginary creatures pulling me down kept calling me by the wrong name. Going with the people who knew my real name seemed like a better idea, even though slipping downwards felt so blissful.  Until the creatures were getting really upset and started yanking me. I just kept fighting. Finally heard the good guys say‚ÄùWe have her back. She‚Äôs breathing‚Äù
Then I started talking and puking and truly felt like I was dying but I was breathing and alive. 
Got to the ER and never forget my poor husband standing in front of me telling the emt, Er personnel and cops I don‚Äôt do Heroin. Just prescribed a few Vicodin. At that precise moment the nurse pulls my bra up and out falls the little baggie. 
The look on his face will haunt me forever.  At that point they gave me more narcan. Oh dear God.  Ok I deserve this punishment but pleeeease, let this be over soon. 
My daughters were in the waiting room. I was too mortified to see them. That upset them even more. I knew at that point I was a total piece of shit, because the nurse in the ER told me my family wouldn‚Äôt want to ever see me and husband would probaly be filing for divorce. After 29 years of marriage I believed her. I was definitely in my right mind,  now wasn‚Äôt I?
This same nurse hit me with narcan a 3 rd time till, someone convinced ai didn‚Äôt need anymore. Thank you dear sweet someone. Everyone who had anything to do with saving my life Saturday night were amazing and extremely caring. Except this one nurse immediately disliked me the minute I was wheeled into ER.

Did a colonoscopy and another endoscopy which all came out clear. So now I go for a capsule endoscopy. I pray they figure out the cause for the internal bleeding. I just want my life back and the ability to run around with my grandkids again. I learned not to fuck around with Heroin, no matter how small amount and snorting it can cause one to overdose. 
My husband and daughters are just relieved I‚Äôm ok and I‚Äôm back home and feel so fortunate my husband came in early from mowing grass to get a drink of water and found me non responsive. He gave me cpr and mtm I‚Äôm told and called 911. He thought I was already dead.

I cold copped recently from the same block Ive been going to, but from a different dude. The boy Ive been getting has been a brown powder in the typical east coast stamp bags, just like all the dope I had done before this relapse. But this time he wasnt on the block, so I bought from another dude, who (aside from ripping me off a bit but hey, price to play) gave me a bag in a white stamp with decidedly different substance. When I poured it out, it was clumpier (?), and needed to be chopped significantly more. Also its a pure white color, like white-as-snow white. Initially I kinda panicked, thinking he had REALLY ripped me off and since I copped it back on friday night and have to wait every week until tuesday-friday to get high (long and shamrful story). But then I considered the idea that it might just be fentanyl. Ive never used fentanyl, aside from whatever fent has been in the bags Ive been using already, so I really dont know what it looks like powdered. I had a lollipop once but that was it. Like I imagine the dope I had been getting has just been real heroin cut with fent, and maybe this bag is just fent cut with another white substance? Does any more experienced user know what it could be? I overdosed once off of a hot bag and there have been literally hundreds of OD's in my city in the past couple weeks, so Im kinda wary. But also desperately would like to not get ripped off and be able to enjoy my few noddable days. I apologize for my inexperience, although things got serious for me quick I still havent been too long in the dope world.

Help would be greatly appreciated, love you all and stay safe out there!

[UPDATE] Ive been looking forward to tonight for so long, so I decided bump some in a realtively safe way, just in case. I split one bag into 8 teeny-tiny lines, and hit my first one. Let me just say: I was FUCKED UP but it startrd o fade just a little bit later. So I redosed again to keep it up, and Im halfway through the bag. I ready info on fentanyl highs, and this seems kinda typical of fetty. Is it safe to assume this is Fentanyl or at least another fentylouge? And how can I maximize its effectiveness while also staying safe? I insufflate, never tried to boof or IV before.",1533092247.0

The Oil Joint had no end of characters and one of the worst was Leprechaun or just Lep. Your first question is ‚ÄúDid he look like a leprechaun?‚Äù and the answer is YES. He stood about 5‚Äô6‚Äù, so he was short and stocky. He bathed infrequently, and he wore the same stinky overalls day after day, occasionally changing his T\-shirt.  Like a leprechaun, Lep had a scraggly red beard, a holdover from slave days. Most importantly, Lep loved gold in whatever form and HE WAS EVIL. He had absolutely no remorse and would chalk up his evilness to ‚ÄúTHE GAME‚Äù.

Lep had just been released from prison after serving 30\+ years for murder. I didn‚Äôt ask the particulars; I didn‚Äôt want to know. Consequently, Lep had that hair\-trigger temper that men develop in prison. A joke instantly became an attack on his manhood and you felt that violence was simmering just below the surface, ready to explode. Worse still, Lep always had a weapon. His favorite was a knife, but he had no qualms about smashing your face with a bottle or whatever else was handy. He also had an old piece of shit 25 auto from Charter Arms or Raven Arms or one of those bottom tier gun makers. The thing would jam every third shot and was just as likely to hurt the shooter as the shootee.  Webster should show a picture of Lep‚Äôs gun in their listing for Saturday Night Special. And to top it all off, Lep was the most racist man that I‚Äôve ever met. He hated all white people just because they were white.

A leprechaun must have his pot of gold and Lep‚Äôs gold was crack. Disregarding quality, Lep was an awesome dealer. For example, he would deliver 24x7, he was on\-time and his bags were heavy. The quality was crap, but he would use coca cola to ‚Äúbrown‚Äù his crack and vinegar to ‚Äúsmell‚Äù his H.  Lep‚Äôs dirtiest trick was to give\-out samples of the good stuff and once the customer was on a run and desperate for a hit, Lep would sell them the crappy stuff. It was all part of THE GAME.",1533083440.0

But I am now like obsessed with it and can‚Äôt stand what I assume is real #4 cause I can‚Äôt smoke it.

Has any one else experienced this or am I just crazy? This shit also lasts keeping me well for like 10-15 hrs so it can‚Äôt be just straight fent

I work in health care in canada at a hospital here. Seen lots of opi users come and go and met one today with the most unreal tolerance I've seen yet. This patient is scripted 3x 120mg CR oxycodone (I didnt even know they made them that high?!) Plus one scheduled IR 20mg to go with her first CR of the day AND then another prn 20mg oxy between every CR... total daily amount of 440mg oxycodone.

As many here are already aware, as he got more dependent some of his worst traits became amplified. Laziness, moochiness and dishonesty in collusion to drive away other productive human individuals. His laziness tied into his slovenly attitudes towards housekeeping and hygiene. This of course helped in the creation of the environment which is well suited to support a thriving bed bug population.


&nbsp;


Bed Bugs from space, who parked their damaged ship in high orbit used a landing pod to enter Earth's atmosphere. They actually made their way into Cliff's home via a case of Twinkies. Who would've thought? When the first space bed bugs began biting - they employed an ability which was unique to their race. This allowed them to establish an electrochemical connection via the blood and nerve fibers and in effect allowed them to form a connection with Cliff's mind. They scanned or detected memory fragments of life experiences that left an indelible impression, and the launch of the American Space Shuttle was one of them.


&nbsp;



The Space Shuttle is no more, while Orion and SLS are behind schedule. There's no way the current mass of bedbugs would be able to board any rocket in their entirety. That's okay, they can do it in small groups. However, the Russian Soyuz rocket is not an option. The Russians don't tolerate bullshit. Though consideration has been given to sneaking aboard in a box of cigars it turns out the Russians stopped smoking Cigars in space when they stopped operating their own space station Mir.


&nbsp;


Eventually, the mass of alien bed bugs which form Cliff did manage to make aboard a rocket. When word got out that Elon Musk might be sending a car to space, the bugs seized upon this opportunity and formed a plan. A small group of bugs managed to stuff themselves within folded sheets of paper in an envelope containing a U-Line catalogue. This was shipped to a the Teasla Motors manufacturing plant at which they in turn made their way into the upholstery of the Tesla Roadster that would ultimately be placed aboard the new Falcon Heavy rocket. 


&nbsp;


Little did the central mass which currently forms Cliff, nor did the bugs in the upholstry know until it was too late that car would not spend any time in Earth orbit. Nope, this car was sent on a trans-Martian trajectory. It would seem that nobody went out of their way to perform detailed calculations. It was expected that the car may go to Mars or that it may end up in the asteroid belt. Either way, this small group of bed bugs are not likely to be rejoined with members from the original mass of bed bugs that are working to hold the shape of Cliff as they swarm beneath his clothing.



&nbsp;



Will they break away group of bugs make it to Mars or the asteroid belt? Will the central mass of alien bed bugs send more members to hitch a ride on a future SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule? Perhaps they will wait for the Crew Dragon variant to become operational so that they'll have access to upholstery and warm bodies.


These and many more questions will be answered in the continuing saga of the alien bed bugs which have chosen Cliff as their host.",1533021807.0

I took 20mg last night (around 1am) and 15 mg this morning (around 11am) and since my second dose I‚Äôve thrown up 6 times. It‚Äôs now 3pm. I‚Äôve never thrown up on OC before so I was wondering if this is normal or if there‚Äôs something actually wrong with my body rn. 

I hadn‚Äôt eaten since 6pm yesterday when I took the second dose and I threw up 5 times before I got lunch around 1pm today and once since (just now) so I‚Äôm getting worried that this might be wrecking my throat a bit. 

I know the general advice is going to just be ‚Äúgo see a doctor‚Äù but I‚Äôd prefer to avoid that if I can figure that this is a regular occurrence for some people as I‚Äôm kinda broke rn. ",1533013094.0

I knew that much.,"My sister told me to meet her at McDonald‚Äôs.  Gabriella needed to call her guy back to tell him where to meet.  I specifically told Gabriella that since we were meeting my sister and her husband and my niece at McDonald‚Äôs, she needed to tell him somewhere close by but not there.  It was not something my sister and her husband needed to see, but after all that, she got off the phone and said,

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, what?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. We‚Äôre meeting him at McDonald‚Äôs.‚Äù

I shook my head.  On the ride to McDonald‚Äôs and that entire morning, now that I think about it, she was the nicest she‚Äôd ever been to me and the calmest I‚Äôd ever seen her, except our first day and a half together.  My sister and her husband were already parked and leaning into the back of their car to get my niece out when we showed up.  I turned to Gabriella.

‚ÄúListen, this is my family.  I don‚Äôt want my sister finding out that we‚Äôre picking up here, too.  She thinks I‚Äôm sober.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù  Gabriella said.

‚ÄúSo, when your guy gets here, if he parks where we can see him, walk outside and get him to go to the other side of the parking lot. Do you understand?  Please, baby, I‚Äôm begging you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, Clyde.  It‚Äôs not even something you need to say.  I would never let your sister find out we were copping dope here or that we were getting high.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.  Here‚Äôs a hundred.‚Äù

I parked next to my sister.  We got out and said hello.  Gabriella introduced herself. 

My red-faced brother-in-law said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm George.  This is Tammy, my wife and this sleeping beauty is Josephine.‚Äù  He was very proud and used his head to indicate my niece still sleeping in her car seat.  I was happy that he‚Äôd introduced himself to Gabriella because I had forgotten his name.  We walked inside.  

My brother-in-law ordered, and my sister picked a table over in the corner next to the window right by the cars.  The child was still sleeping, but once the food came, baby Josephine woke up.  About six months had passed since I first saw the baby, or so my sister determined while we talked about it.  

The first time I met her was in my aunt‚Äôs kitchen. My sister and brother-in-law handed me what I thought was a few pounds of hamburger meat that they‚Äôd put in a weird towel for some reason, but then it started whining and moving.  That had been my niece.  Now, that chunk of ground up beef had turned into a very belligerent and selfish miniature monkey.  The child threw tantrums.  She took food out of George‚Äôs mouth and threw it on the floor.  Cute little baby Josephine pulled a tray of two drinks off the table and onto the floor and laughed.  I watched horrified, and at that moment, a busted, burgundy Oldsmobile with tinted windows parked and bumped bass directly outside of the window from us.

My sister and George sneered at the car and its music.  Gabriella stood up.  She walked outside and jumped right into the passenger seat for less than a minute and jumped out right in front of us.  My sister and brother-in-law were incredulous.  Gabriella walked directly to the bathroom, and my sister turned to look at me.  I expected to see hurt.  I expected to see great disappointment, but she just kept trying to act like Gabriella wasn‚Äôt scoring and running to the bathroom to get high.  George took my niece in his arms to see the pretty colors of the inside playground, even if she was too young to play.  

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre leaving again?‚Äù  My sister tried to play it cool.  She looked down and sighed.  She tore the paper straw wrapper into bits of nothing.  When she looked up her brown eyes were wet and swollen.  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to stay?‚Äù  

There was nothing for me to say.  I couldn‚Äôt stay.  She wasn‚Äôt like me, though.  Our childhoods would be forever bound by their brokenness and heartbreak, but unlike her, it had only made me calloused and ruthless.  I had become someone else.  She‚Äôd remained the innocent child.  She‚Äôd waited here for the remains of her family to be restored and happy again.  When she saw me at our aunt‚Äôs house, I was home from the streets after all those years of no communication and her wondering.  It had given life to those dreams of hers.  Our mother was dead.  Dad was in prison.  I was leaving again, and I might never see her again.  

You see?  I had become everything that I hated about my father.  That‚Äôs why they called me Boom Boom.  It was never Clyde doing those things.  Clyde couldn‚Äôt knock anyone out.  Clyde didn‚Äôt have the nerve to rip an eyeball out of a socket or collect debts for Jimbo and Fin or do the Faceless One‚Äôs dirt on the streets.  No.  Clyde had gotten lost somewhere under the persona and violence and the drugs a long time ago, and if ever he did show up, he was weak and confused and atrophied.  He couldn‚Äôt even stand up to himself and his addiction.  He couldn‚Äôt stand up to our Dad.  He couldn‚Äôt stand up to Gabriella.  All he could do was hide and let the monster living within himself handle his affairs.  And that was never pretty.

Now, though, my sister excused herself.  She walked quickly towards the bathroom, which Gabriella hadn‚Äôt exited yet.  She was trying to find a vein or nodded.  I knew that much.  My sister would have to wonder what was wrong.  George walked over to me with the baby.  We talked a minute, before my sister came back to the table.

‚ÄúYour girlfriend is standing in the middle of the bathroom.  There‚Äôs blood all over the floor!  I picked up a needle and threw it in the garbage.‚Äù  I looked up from talking to George.  My sister continued.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs out of it, Clyde, and that woman right there saw it.‚Äù  My sister pointed to a well-dressed woman in fine black clothing and expensive jewelry.  The woman was waiting at the front counter for management.  I kissed my sister on the cheek.

‚ÄúSee ya, Tammy.  I gotta go.  Bye George.‚Äù

I ran to the women‚Äôs bathroom.  Gabriella was in her typical nodded stance.  I threw her over my shoulder and ran through the lobby to the car.  Her head got banged up as I shoved her into the front seat.  I never looked back.

*So much for not letting my sister find out we were scoring or getting high.*  I thought as we got onto the highway and headed south towards Kentucky.  But then, another voice spoke up in there.  It asked me where Boom Boom was.         ",1533009039.0

About 90 seconds into this .2ish shot my bells are ringing like I just shot crack. I‚Äôm drenched in sweat, and my vision is going blurry. I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm falling through a tunnel, and when I reach then end I puke up whatever the dope doesn‚Äôt want in my system. It was fucking amazing.

Been in the hospital since early Sunday morning. My lungs started hurting, I kept smoking, then lungs started to close up a bit, kept smoking. Got an inhaler, helped about 10%. Success! Kept smoking.


I ended up nodding out Sunday night not really breathing right. Had been up for a few days at that point so I thought a little break and some sleep would fix me right up.

Woke up a few hours later, couldn't breathe at all. Felt like I was only getting air into the top two inches of my lungs... Lips were blue, couldn't really talk.

Checked into ER. Was getting under 70% oxygen. 

I'm getting steroids, albuterol and a shit ton of xanax. Was oxygen for a couple days and now I'm getting 95% all by myself!

Sitting in my kitchen, sipping my coffee when Cliff messaged me on AIM and by AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) I mean whatever the kids are using for instant messaging today - just don't want to specify what platform hence the smokescreen imposed by using *old* web nomenclature.


First it came up as a notification on my laptop screen, but I took care to respond on my phone in case he wanted to come to my house. I wanted to be able to pretend to be at work if it necessary. The fact I was responding from my mobile device would be indicated on his end if he was paying attention to such a detail.


&nbsp;


Anyway, I'm sure you can imagine. He had called me and left a comical message a couple of days prior in what sounded like a bartarded stupor, though it could have been his chronic opioid induced speech pattern. He joked about massacring my family and my turtles if I didn't call back by midnight. I know it sounds fucked up but this is one thing I actually can understand and be fine with - saying outrageous shit for the sake of humor. I know he's not going to torch my turtle and if he did she'd go under water. 



To the point, when he called he said there was an emergency of epic proportions. No detail. Someone in this community speculated that his emergency was that he had no one else to take advantage of on that day.


&nbsp;


For ~~today's~~ Sunday's IM (instant message) conversation it went as follows...



**Cliff:** You alive man ??



**Cliff:** I haven't heard or sen from you in 4ever.



**Me:** Yes, and you? I've just been focusing on keeping my nose clean. You know the first few weeks can be especially challenging for some.




**Cliff:** yes, of course and u also know that I'D NEVER tempt ya if u r going on the straight and arrow.



**Cliff:** but anyways how have you been?



**Me:** Been writing a lot, racking up miles on my bike and continuing to change out and upgrade it's components.



**Me:** Also been presented with another job opportunity from *mutual friend x*.



**Cliff:** that's all, no time to hang out anymore?



**Me:** Like I said, keeping my nose clean. I know you have no wish or intention to derail my recovery but I certainly can slip up quite easily through this critical stage before I can confidently put my self int he line of... lines lol



**Cliff:** I understand but I feel like I lost one of my good friends



**Cliff:** When I did nothing wrong



&nbsp;


He then sent a text message to my phone through a web browser based text messaging service as a test. Thus we can infer that his cell phone service is turned off but he still has internet access for the moment. So come pay day, this is how he'll contact his middle or his plug if they don't answer the phone. The events of this post actually happened two days ago. Later in the day Cliff did call me from his house phone and I didn't answer. 


&nbsp;


Cliff also called me from his house phone while I was at work yesterday. I accidentally texted him saying I worked until 8pm. I meant to text that to another person but that's okay because I wasn't going to be at home after work anyway. Cliff didn't text back (IM not phone) or leave voice message. So I have no idea aside from our conversation through AIM on Sunday why he was calling me.


&nbsp;


I can only speculate what he's calling me on the phone about. Maybe his mom's heart medication is ready for pick-up and since Cliff doesn't have money for a cab he needs to send someone else. In this speculative situation, he can't send Derrick to pick it up because junkies usually don't accept heart medication in place of oxy. It's on the way home from work for me so it should be no trouble is what Cliff would be thinking when asking me. One would think this would be an easy thing to ask by text. Then again, it's harder to say no and easier for someone like Cliff to get what they want through persistence in a phone call. 


I don't really know and I don't want to find out either way if it requires my physical presence or a verbal phone conversation.



&nbsp;


#A Little Dissection



Regarding our web based instant message conversation, I'd like to dissect it a little bit for fun. 



First in order of where it occurred in the convo: ""**I feel like I lost one of my good friends**"", ""when I did nothing wrong.""



Maybe he genuine feels this way, I think he is almost certainly lonely. He screwed over a number of people to get to this point, I was among a handful who gave him innumerable chances to play his games. Nobody gave him an extra chance hoping to get screwed. I say a small handful because most outside that small sub-group only ever gave him a single chance to fuck them over. Whereas I, or his brother for example gave him more slack. By doing so we inadvertently sent the message that he could it again with no major consequence.



Point is, by mixing friendhsip, business and the game together he alienated one of his ""good friends."" I'm not saying those things can't be mixed, but the way Cliff conducts such activities causes the current outcome to be quite inevitable.


&nbsp;

#""When I did nothing wrong""


The second part of the previously quoted sentence about losing a good friend, he added that and asserted, **""when I did nothing wrong""**


Of course I screamed BUSLLSHIT to myself, but didn't see a point in arguing this assetion with him. I doubt I'd get him to agree, and if he did indicate he agreed it would only be so that he could ask me to do something. An empty apology just so that the conversation can move forward and he could obtain something he needs.


That's speculative as well, but a reasonable hypothesis.

&nbsp;




To be fair, in the past when I've felt like I was wronged by Cliff there were times that it was a legit supply line issue. However, I often couldn't tell if he was bullshitting me or if we were just victims of outside factors.


&nbsp;

9391uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9391uw/the_innumerable_theses/,13,https://redd.it/9391uw,sloan_fitch,The Innumerable Theses,"#This list
 was written to go along with [another post that was already being composed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9391z9/chat_log_with_cliff_along_with_analysis_and/?ref=share&ref_source=link) Cliff's claim is that he feels like he lost a good friend when he **did nothing wrong**. It got under my skin, I reflect a little bit and although I might've simply hashed this out while talking to myself during a bike ride - I thought it to be safer to share it here beacuse I have a long bike ride ahead of me which will bring me to some of the more hazardous routes. Thus in the name of bicycle safety, I present it here.


&nbsp;

#The Innumerable Theses


* That time I paid for a bun and got scraps and lies while waiting for the rest to be delivered.


* The time he buttered me up to give him my last $200 to put towards bulk subs that never appeared. 


* Those couple of times where I paid a little bit for a share in a larger order and waited nearly a week for delivery because his dboy/middle got pulled over. In the mean time we had to wait for his dboy to recoup his losses. Thanks to a new program in our city, instead of arresting the dboy the cops simply confiscated the dope and gave him a desk appearance ticket. 


* That time his dboy delivered for the last time - it was fake dope. I know it was because a week earlier Cliff and Ben paid the dboy with a fake hundred dollar bill. He caught it right away but was cool about it...  It my opinion it was not a coincidence that the same guy delivered fake dope a week later. Cliff took care of me on script day which I'd say is actually a positive until we think of the implication on the next point.




* His sister (they don't get along) screwed me out of $60. I basically got 2 subs for $80. Cliff put up half the money. In fact, first he had my $40 and I had to fucking negotiate to get MY money back. Then he wanted subs too so he sent me to the ATM at 3AM with his card in order to add to the order. After paying his sister and getting nothing more than the initial two at the beginning of the weekend, we were both at a loss.                          



 In a bartarded state of mind Cliff **gave me an ultimatum to pay him back within a day**. To which I vehemently disagreed because I've been made to wait a week for pay back from him during circumstances that may not have been in his control. In this case, it was definitely not my fault so I felt that I should at least have equal courteousy extended to me that I have for him innumerable times prior.



 I paid him back, but most certainly did not do it within 24 hours per his ultimatum. totally got under my skin that he felt such a double-standsrd to be appropriate. This left another indelible mark.




* I also witnessed him plotting to screw others, things like ""I'm holding two buns for Dack to pick up tomorrow, I'm thinking about doing half a bun and telling him I was shorted and that I'll pay him back on script day."" I suspect that he would have similar conversations with others if I wasn't his only actual friend and at the very least such was an indispensable part of his thought process.


&nbsp;


After each time he caused me to lose money he always paid me back in pills or dope. In times where I was gonna buy either anyway this was fine and fair aside from being super rude and inconvenient. Truly so, it was often like being tricked into loaning someone moeny for a week or two in when I had no intention or plans to be without the money for more than a day or two. 



&nbsp;


#Why this post? 


Surely some are thinking ""this again?"" Others might enjoy the enterinment value, the deep analysis and the pactical educational value contained therein. However for me, I just wanted to compile as many reasons as I could remember. These are reasons as to why I should not feel conflicted about denying someone who refers to me as a ""good friend"" the opportunity to be graced with my presence. All of the game related stuff is more than enough to remind me.


&nbsp;

If all that wasn't enough, which it is then I have a couple of more points to remind myself. Hanging out with Cliff even if there was a guarantee that he wasn't a bad influence, even if he never asked to borrow any moeny, resources, if he wasn't a mooch...


His house is a bio-hazard. He's a bio-hazard. If he enters my house I could have bed bugs again, it wasn't too long ago that I had just got that shit under control after the second wave which he precipitated by providing transportation to a bed bug army. 


&nbsp;


#All that shit aside, it's just weird hanging with him. 



He's the kind of the person who will ask you to get him a can of soda from the fridge when we're both sitting down because you're closer to the fridge. 



The kind of person who used to get me to walk his dog and when I stopped falling for that bullshit he used pills and dope to get me to do it until my tolerance increased and I was buying my own dope.



The kind of person who asks where you going when you see him outside and uses it as a chance to get a favor. Like if I was taking a simple leisurely ten mile bike ride, he'd hand me his debit card to get a cople of bottls of soda, because ""it's on the way back."" Then a number of times I'd find out his debit card didn't have funds on it so I end up looking like a broke and disorganized jerk-off at the ckeck-out counter. Diddo to those times he gave me shopping list of donuts and junk food. 

&nbsp;


Then there's the really weird stuff, like how he'd often get me to hang out a little later than I wanted to, Thus interfering with my workout routine, thereby contributing to my loss of muscle mass. Maybe he was lonely and people being a lonely does garner my empathy but I think routine was more important to him. Every day since he broke his TV, he needed to move his TV from his living room to his bed room. He always preferred having help doing that before bed so if I wanted to leave too soon he'd be like ""this movie ends in 20 minutes, please stick around ane help me move my TV"" or ""you said you'd stay til the end of the movie."" 


&nbsp;


Point is, it was his irresponsible behavior that broke his TV. Any TV he broke was basically his fault. Now that I think about it, this will get a post of it's own. For now, I'm going to stop here. I have to send a real friend my resume because I was informed yesterday about a potentially lucrative job opportunity.

Problem is, it doesnt kill pain anymore, it just gets me high.

i take 0.5mg/day (1/2 mg)

my doctor was telling me about how he had a patient whom uses the Actiq Lozenges for their migraines

Not only do i have severe migraines, i have severe TMJ / Neuralgia, and fibromyalgia, among other things

When these two combine, its like im dying

I have tried Tramadol concurrently , i have tried lyrica, neuronton and every muscle relaxer

Tramadol works but only if i take a half tablet before i take a suboxone and a half tablet after . a full 50mg makes me dizzy, even if i take it by itself with no bupe.

My doctor doesnt give a shit if i take an opiate for severe pain . 

The problem is now , ive been feeling a lot better, and i havent got my MRIs done, so my main doctor, who prescribed the Tramadol, wont see me until i get the MRIs, which will most likely show nothing . 

Like i said, ive been feeling a little better lately, so this is my time to get some stuff done, not go to MRI appointments, i run a business, and i have things to do that ive waited 7 months for.

After I get my MRIs completed, what is the best way to bring up Actiq lozenge to my doctor? Tramadol makes me feel ill. shakey, and shit.

Id really like to try a low dose actiq lozenge OR maybe tapentadol . 
(taptentadol should be able to be taken concurrently with suboxone as it inhibits the general same pathways as tramadol)

as far as medications go , the only thing that helps me is tylenol and its tearing a hole in my stomach. virtually everything ive tried sucks balls, either doesnt work or makes me zombified.

id also like to get ketamine for pain . try it rather.. but we know that ain gonn happen

What are your suggestions on how to speak to my doctor about switching my Tramadol to a more powerful pain med like Actiq or Tapentadol?

More than likely i could get something like abuse proof hydromorphone or abuse proof something else... but i think he thinks i am a drug addict, yet still gave the tramadol. i hope he doesnt hate me because i have not done the MRIs yet  . id like to do a stand-up one.

I have a 5.5 mg patch, so 100 ml would make it 55ug per 1 ml dose. Im thinkin Id be more comfortable with 200 ml or even 250 ml so a 1ml dose would be ~25-20 ug. 


Regardless it will still come off weaker than what is in the actual patch, Im expecting a 60% extraction, but will treat it as 100% extraction as a precaution. 


Can plain water be used for this? Or do I need a saline solution? Or even alcohol? Id prefer not to use any sort of rubbing alcohol, or alcohol in general as I plan on consuming the final product (obviously lol). But im thinking it would have to be like, extracted with rubbing alcohol, evaporate the alcohol, take the ‚Äúpowder‚Äù or whatevers left over, and add to a solution.

So I took the first 15 at 3:00, then second at 4:30, the third 15 at 5:30 and the last one at 7:00. I didn‚Äôt realize that takin them like that won‚Äôt contribute to a great high. So once I found that out I stopped. It‚Äôs now 3:00 pm the next day and I want to take a 30 mg and leave it at that and just enjoy that high. I guess my question is, my last dose was at 7:00pm the prior day and that totaled me out at 60mg at that point. I haven‚Äôt done any since and want to start now with a 30 and that will be all.. is there still a build up in my system? Should I wait a full 24 hours? Will the 30 give me a really good high and last for a while?",1532976904.0

I haven‚Äôt done ket before but I‚Äôve been on a hectic blackout bender this weekend and woke up with a fat bag of drugs, not sure what combinations to try. K + Oxy seemed like a good time because I‚Äôve really been enjoying my oxy and from what I‚Äôve read about ketamine i‚Äôll hopefully quite like that too, but I‚Äôve never really done dissociatives at all. Oxy is quickly becoming my drug of choice so I‚Äôd like my next high to include it if possible, which is why I‚Äôm posting here instead of just on r/drugs or something. 

If anyone has any suggestions for a top quality time I have: 

2mg xanax (never tried)

9g weed (used about 3 times)

15mg valium (first time was this weekend and don‚Äôt really remember the high at all)

160mg oxycontin (infrequent user, 4th time was tonight)

250mg MDMA (tried once but don‚Äôt think I got high)

400mg ketamine (never tried)

Also have some tobacco and could probably get some alcohol if need be. I can also get some dihydrocodeine cough syrup and maybe nangs too, but I haven‚Äôt bought a cracker yet so only if it‚Äôs for something to *really* get me fucked up. 

For reference I will likely be doing everything alone üôÅ so nothing suuuuuuper dangerous, obviously drug use is never going to be 100% safe but I don‚Äôt want to take any excessive risks as there won‚Äôt be anyone to help me out if things go really bad. 

Apologies if this is an odd request, but I‚Äôd love any recommendations you guys might have, especially if it‚Äôs along the lines of ‚Äúx + y is shitty don‚Äôt do it‚Äù.  

Unfortunately I can‚Äôt talk to my boyfriend about this and the only other person I know that does more than weed is my dealer and I don‚Äôt really wanna embarrass myself with my inexperience, so dosage advice would be amazing too please!

Edit: Thanks to the special one who helped me though <3
To my amazement there was no real symptoms except feeling a little colder than usual and no great appetite. I did taper of course and jumped off at 1mg but it was a hit and miss taper if you get me.

It might sound crazy, but a part of me actually enjoys it, if I'm being honest. I think its because it feels great when your able to scratch it?.

Btw....with how much everyone loves pictures I'll post a couple when it looked the worst. But one thing to keep in mind, it bruising throughout the area, but that's not from the abscess or miss.

As I said, I felt in love. Wanted to know every fucking thing about this substance, it was so fascinating! At this time I wasn't a full time user, and live was pretty good at this point. I really wanted to be in this shit, what is stupid. I tried everything, from Codeine to Heroin. I bought 1g of some #4 and began to smoke. This was the biggest mistake i've ever did. I got addicted. Not physical, but mental. So I tried to chase that feeling, again and again. That I got physical addicted too. At my birthday I bought 200mg of oxycodone and popped pill after pill, without getting high, I cried alone in my room while my family is eating cace and having fun. Yey. 3 days ago I ran out of pills, and I couldn't contanct my plug. I went to the town to pick up some pills. Bought them at least from my alcoholic ex girlfriend (this lady steals from old people the meds, such a awful person). I bought totally overpriced tilidine 100mg tabs. I was really ashamed, took the next bus home, crushed up 10 of this fuckers and mixed it with a pepsi. As I stared on that bottle of pepsi, with this huge amout of pills in it, I cried.

As of last week he said he would usually be carrying a few gs to sell daily as before he'd grab cash from me upfront then pickup and deliver my shit.

Today he didnt have any and was going to reup but wanted my cash upfront to get for me.  He also middles for other people and in the past would collect peoples cash upfront to get a good amount to allow himself to get in on the pickup without having to throw any money in.  So everyone got what they paid for but since a decent amount was purchased and he got it for cheaper buying in bulk he was able to get some for free....or basically his portion for middlng and taking all the risk.

Ive never had any issues with him getting my cash upfront except sometimes hes taken all day or days a few times to deliver.  Id rather not do it that way but he was my only hookup for black until recently so that's the only way i could get any ...again this is the only source i had until recently when i found a few new connects.

So he hits me back around 2pm today saying he needs cash first to grab and i said ok come by to get it.  He says he will be by soon.  I ask if i could roll with....no response.....i ask a little while later if he still coming....no response....so after like 4 hours or so my newer connect who always has and doesnt middle hits me up asking if i need.  It being awhile since my middle last responded i wasnt sure what was up so i hit my new connect back saying ""ya i need"" and rolled by him and grabbed my shit quick and easy no delays.

So right after i did that of course my middle hits me back which was after like 4 hours saying he sorry for lagging and hes at my place.  He doesnt live far from me btw.  So i was a little irratated that he was MIA the whole time and didnt respond so i didnt get back to him.  Now kno that hes lagged like crazy sometimes when hes got my cash and went missing and given me excuse after excuse to why hes taking so long or not even showed up in the first place as cause for delay in delivery so im to the point where im ready to cut ties with him but since he started middling for me we've kinda become cool i guess and i still use him cuz he does deliver and that is huge for me since i don't always have transportation to get to my new connects.

So my middle blows up my phone calling like 20 times over a few min period and sends a crazy amount of texts like ""where the fuck are you""....""you fucked me by not answering""....""johnny_cockring how can you do this to me???""....""i came all the way to your house"" (even tho i live a few miles away)....and so on.  So i havent responded and am really turned off by the whole situation cuz dude doesnt get back to me and just expects me to wait around when i had no idea what was going down after we last talked cuz he took forever to get back to me and then blows me up and I wasnt sure if he was still coming or what.  

So am i the one who fucked up cuz i didnt wanna wait and took advantage of having a ride when i dont usually have one to my other reliable dudes to pickup instead of waiting for my middle whos been known to take forever and didnt update me on when he would be by after i texted him and called him to see what was up and got no response.  After like 4 or so hours did he finally get back to me but i already lined something else up cuz i didnt wanna lose out if he bailed or didnt show up which coulda been a possibility with his track record of delivering.  So whatcha all think?  Im seriously just considering cuttin homeboy out due to all this hoopla and dont need the drama.

Well that is all....please feel free all to lemme know if i fucked up or am ok for feelin off by this whole mess.

Tldr: hit my middle up earlier to get me some black said he would come by soon to get my cash ended up taking forever to respond and come by my place (4+ hours actually) and by that time i picked up from my other dude and middle got pissed cuz  i didnt respond to him after he finally showed up and got back to me.",1532943467.0

It's 4am here and just did my like 7th shot of the night and about to go to bed. I'm sure everyone here can relate to the enjoyable feeling that happens when combining opiates and nicotine. They synergize really well. I usually do this with cigarettes. Smoking cigs definitely makes me nod harder.

Now I own a suorin, which I purchased sort of recently. It is like a juul with 50mg nic salts... when I hit it after getting high I feel like it makes my high stronger, however the noddiness isn't as intense and instead I feel more awake and alert. This isn't necessarily bad, but my addictive/compulsive behavior makes it easier for me to do more dope. Does anyone relate or know what I'm talking about? It's like the nicotine from the vape, since it's in much higher quantity of nicotine I'm guessing is giving me a different buzz as oppose to when I smoke a cigarette. I prefer the cigarette synergy more because I'm less inclined to do more dope",1532939554.0

Ocs are more potent than morphine, right? so how much of IV morphine is equal to IV oxy, I have the 30mg morph pills, they are ER, and have the little beads inside the cap.

I shot over 400-450mg of morph daily, and I have 330mg and this 15mg oxys, I will divide my doses and try to be good. Should I just eat the damn oxy and shot just the morphine? or should I prep a morph+oxy shot, and how to prep it? The ones that I have are the old formulation, before it gel up, I can just crush and eat it, or crush and snort. So how can I prep them to shot?

Been lurking on this sub for years now on my main. Some time ago I created an alt and was posting here somewhat frequently, and boy has a lot happened since then! I quit using my alt and went to rehab to get sober for a few months, got a job offer across the country, relapsed, moved to take the job, and now I've been here working and trying to maintain a habit ever since. I will say that I like the price of tar, and it feels more mellow and safer compared to ECP, but boy do I miss the heavy nods and amazing rush from a fat shot of #4! ODing really sucked though and I dont really worry about that with tar. I usually get tar that i would say is about 9/10 as far as tar goes and some coke thats more like 8/10. I would estimate that I would have to shoot roughly twice the amount of tar to get similar effects to the #4 I was getting back home. And I cant afford a habit large enough to allow me to OD. Idk if the high is just more subtle or if my body is just better attenuated to DAM than MAM. I've considered trying to extract and separate the DAM and MAM from my stuff to compare, but I think that's more trouble than it's really worth..

Anyways, the coke plug is a new thing I've only had for a few weeks (after 18 months without) so naturally I've been shooting speedballs like crazy recently. I've noticed something peculiar about speedballs with tar and I wanted to see how anyone's observations compare with mine. When mixing the two in the syringe cap I've noticed that with *really* good tar the solution will fizz and bubble when the coke is added, almost like when you add citric acid to freebase coke. Except this isn't freebase coke. And if I happen to cop some less than average dope, then it doesn't really make the coke solution bubble up that much. I've also noticed that when I shoot the coke by itself, the rush isn't nearly what it is compared to when I add even the smallest amount of tar. Perhaps it's related to the fact that heroin imitates dopamine while cocaine causes the brain to be flooded with it and prevent its reuptake? So if my brain is already drained of natural dopamine then adding cocaine wont have much effect since theres not much to flood the brain with; but if heroin is added, the heroin acts to replace all the missing dopamine through imitation, and the cocaine acts to prevent its reuptake, which would normally happen very quickly. So the drugs combined work synergistically and produce a stronger effect than either alone. Sounds plausible but biochemistry was always my least favorite subject.

We (Partner in Crime & I) had some subs but of course wanted to get dope if at all possible so were putting off taking any.

Sold $40 worth of subs in the morning, and some friends had promised the previous day to give us a ride to the bus stop that's closer to the city, because the bus only runs twice a day here on Sundays. Unfortunately, they weren't answering so we were feeling pretty shitty.

Then a miracle happened: I put a $300 item on craigslist like two months ago, and the other day someone hit me up about meeting up for it today. I had gotten contacted by so many bots, scammers, and flakes, I didn't think much of it, but this afternoon the dude actually hit me up, came through and gave me $250 cash! We now had close to $300! AND our ride got back to us immediately after that!

Went and got a healthy amount of dope, a couple bags of powder, and 4 footballs, with plenty of money left over to go back tomorrow as well as buy some food and a couple other things I've been wanting. We were kinda harassed/physically assaulted by some punk ass juveniles in the city which was kinda ass, but I let it roll off my back. I told the dudes on the set and they went off looking for the kids lol, can't have people scaring your customers off.

 The goal would be to sense an overdose using biometrics and either create a sound alert to try to get the person aware again, a message alert using one of the wireless or GSM peripherals or perhaps ultimately administer a narcan nasal spray. The sensors I have found that could measure these are as follows: pulse sensor, temperature sensor (placed under nose for breath) or alternately thermistor sensor which would be smaller but achieve the same result, accelerometer for chest movement or alternately inertial measurement unit (IMU) for the same application, flexible band belt respiration sensor/Fabric stretch sensor, sound sensor to listen for breathing, IR sensor (to measure heart beats), pressure sensor for respiration. 

I have no idea which would be best alone or combined to get the most accurate idea if someone is slipping into an overdose or has already overdosed. I do see projects people have done in the past that do similar things measuring breathing or pulse such as [this one] (http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2012/htq2_mg573/htq2_mg573/index.htm) 
made by people at Cornell so some smart mofos. Their device uses a thermistor sensor and has a buzzer when breathing rate gets too low and a different sound when breathing stops. 

My goal would ultimately be to have some sort of beeping if breathing gets too slow to give the person a chance to wake up and if breathing got way too slow or stopped it would somehow activate a nasal spray of narcan. I don't know if this is possible or perhaps too ambitious trying to administer narcan but at the very least there could be a noise to alert family or roommates or even a prerecorded message calling 911 using the GSM board (911 is free to call too so there wouldn't even be any need to put minutes on the SIM). 

I have had this idea in my head for ages and just got into Arduino's and saw potential to turn this idea into a reality. The device being open source means anyone could get the parts and make it themselves and even if it needed to be sold it could be made very compact with some of the arduino boards and could be as low of a price as 40 bucks as that is what the Cornell students project costs as a one off. 

Please critique the hell out of the idea, tell me if anyone would actually even use it, if you'd be afraid of it malfunctioning and narcaning you when your not ODing (my biggest worry) or it failing and not saving you putting myself at liability (would need to consult lawyers on that one, maybe make it a kit and not even sell it as a narcan dispenser). What you think about if its possible to even code something like this for all you coders, help writing the code if anyone is actually interested and passionate about the project, possible sensor combos that would ensure no accidental narcaning. Any input would help me so much as this has been something I have been building in my head for years and want to see it actually happen if I can. Thanks in advance.

So today a good friend of mine called me early in the morning with some exciting news. He had gotten ahold of an m-box 30 and had a leftover 602 script and asked if he could swing by and nod out to some cartoons and pizza. I had been on my regular opioid abstination period for a while and therefore I decided ""what the heck, it's Sunday"" and told him to come over. So he swings by and we decided to order some carry-out from a local pizza joint before we'd start kicking it and buy some cigs to really get the full effect. On our way there we each took 7.5mg/480mg of oxy/apap to get things started. We arrive there, paid for the pizza, took it to the car and smoked a couple cigs on the parking lot. We were already feeling it. 

 He spontaneously takes out the m-box and crushes it on his phone with a lighter and good old Andrew Jackson. I was like: ""bro, I thought we were gonna sniff back home"", he then said: ""let's just do a line each and take the rest of the endos in yo house"", I said ""cool"". He took Andrew off the crushed remains of the m-box, I noticed it had a bright blue color, but I had never had an m-box before and thought little of it. I ripped half the pill and guided it safely through my nose and into my oxygen sacks and shortly after we were headed our way. All my insides felt warm and comfy. But, I noticed it came up ALOT faster and harder than other oxy 30's. I was almost noddin' the fuck out in less than 5 minutes of insufflation, but I thought little of this. 

After a couple of blocks, my buddy stops near the sidewalk and told me he's noddin' hard and asks me if I could drive. I get out he car and went around to get in the driver's seat and I was thinking to myself: ""how in the fuck are we going to get home"" but I'd rather drive than let my friend because he really was kicking it. It took him a minute or two to get out because he was soo out of it; then and there I realized something was off. I got in the driver's seat, he got in and we left. Not even 5 minutes after we leave, this nigga passed out in the seat and I started freaking out. I was like: ""Bro! Bro! Get up!! Yo, common you gotta get up!"". He wasn't responding. His skin turned as pale as snow and his lips and fingers blue. He shortly after had lapses where he stopped breathing. I was crying and trying to keep his head straight and gave him a half-assed cpr which seemed to work, all while driving and trying to fight the nod to get some help for him. I really thought I had lost him a couple times on the way home. Never had I felt such dread in my life.

 I FINALLY get home and I went to grab my phone to call the ambulance but I couldn't find it. I freaked out a little bit, and stopped a lady and asked her if she could call 911 because my friend wasn't responding. She called an ambulance and they were on their way. I was trying to keep my friend alive by continuing cpr and this lady starts asking questions. And she's saying: did you take drugs? You look like you take drugs. Is he on heroin?, I said ""I don't know lady, he just went out and I'm very worried, thanks for your help but can you leave me alone?""; this moment right here she went from ""nice"" to being a massive huge cunt and starts blabbering: ""You little shit! If it weren't for me he would die! You want me to leave? Because I'll leave and let him die! And I said ""look lady get the fuck out of here if you want, I dont need your shit right now. 

By this point my landlord had come out and had grasped the situation. I then see Ms. Bitchface headed straight to him and I could just feel the shittalking going down over there. While she was telling my landlord all sorts of stupid bullshit, I was still trying to get my friend up. I gently slapped him in the face and shook him a little bit to get him up. My biggest concern was him choking on his own vomit so I just kept his head straight. And right before the ambulance got there, he started getting up. I felt sooo relieved. He was conscious again and when the ambulance arrived they took some vitals and asked what happened. My friend being a smug motherfucker he told them he just had a low blood sugar and passed out. They asked if he had used any drugs and he just denied it. Apparently they bought into it and they finally asked if he wanted to go to a hospital but he said no, that he'd just eat something and be alright. 

After all of this had happened I thanked the universe for not letting my buddy go. I was in awe and I will never take him for granted again. We nodded out for the rest of the day and now he's almost completly sober and back at his house. It was a wild-ass ride.  

Please please please test your shit before you use it. I learned today the hard way and it could have went so much worse, I'm just glad he was able to push through an overdose unscathed and I still can't believe how I even managed to get home safely and kept it cool in front the EMTs or the cops. 

Tl;Dr: Friend calls me, says he has some endos and and m-box. Turned out m-box was pressed w/fent but realized when it was too late. Friend almost died, but turned out ok.

Since that Friday & Saturday night debacle I havent heard of more ODs but whatever.

A quick google search will bring up the article which will explain in more details about what happened and the exact stamp which caused everything.

In general though the stamp is from a block which is one of the few ""heroin"", or at least heroin and fent mixed bags left. Most of the corners down in Kensington sell bags of fent & fent/heroin bags. Of course there are likely more heroin only stamps down there, but just stating from experience. I am a fentanyl user personally so I am not really sure.

Anyway, basically from what the articles have stated and from first hand reports of people I know, after people IVed or snorted the bags they got a scary and completely shocking reaction. The dude I spoke to ended up laying down and almost seizing up. He said he was basically hallucinating. He also kind of fell out like a normal high dosed fent IV. Paramedics reported that when people were given narcan they became completely shocked along with other abnormal reactions. I forget all the reported symptoms from the articles I read just that they were really nuts.

The bags were sent out to be tested and just recently they came back. The bags included heroin and fentanyl. They also included synthetic marijuana!

As somebody who only has experience smoking normal weed and hates it because of bad side effects such as paranoia, shortness of breath, chest pounding, and depression I cant imagine what these people went through.

On top of that it was synthetic marijuana not regular weed. Ive never smoked K2, but damn that freaks me out that some assholes cut the heroin with not only fentanyl, but this shit.

I havent seen any recent reports or talked to anyone down there that has said it is still out there. I have copped on blocks just next to that street and have gotten the same expected fentanyl.

Anyway, figured Id share this again because of how interesting and scary it is. Supposedly 100+ people were reported to have non fatal ODs stretching from Kenzo to Allentown, and that is just the reported cases. Im sure there were a lot more considering how popular I know that block is and the fact that it was the weekend.

One last tidbit. Basically the numbers were average for the amount of fatal ODs in the city. Most likely related to other bags.",1532918482.0

I'll try to keep it short. I've been using heroin for about 4 years now, however, a year ago I managed to quit(for the most part). Aside from a couple of slip ups, I've been sober until about 2 months ago.

 So i started using again, I live on the west coast so it's mainly black tar over here. My dealer told me he had some china white, which he admitted he didn't know what was in it and thought it was fent. I tried it(smoking) and just from 1 small hit I felt a pretty strong rush. So I've been using this stuff for about 1.5 months now, and it is STRONG. I haven't touched a needle in a year so I've just been smoking. So I'm 99% sure this stuff is fentanyl, it's strong as hell, doesn't last long, and definitely not as euphoric. I also get sick pretty quickly which sucks.

So I am asking you guys for help. I NEED to quit, I hate this stuff and I'm tired of this lifestyle and I'm furious at myself for throwing almost a year of relative sobriety away. I want to get clean forever. I've only been using this stuff for 1.5 months and I haven't touched a needle so I figure I can do this! I know it's only going to get harder to quit so I need to do this. So here's where I'm at:

I use about 0.2g of this china white fent a day. I have about 2 days worth of it left. I am going to continue doing what I do for the next 2 days then I am getting clean. I have 6 subutex pills(they're 8mg RP b8). I don't think I can get any more subs so this is what I have to work with(well and a lot of weed and wax) So how do I go about quitting with what I have? any help is much appreciated. I honestly have never used subs before so I have no idea what I am doing! ",1532917890.0

After jumping from anywhere between 150 to 300 mg / day of oxy, I waited until I was in full withdrawal cut off a fingernail size sliver of sub (probably .5 mgs), let it dissolve under my tongue. After waiting 45mins- hr I took another ~.5mg sliver which seemed to get me feeling ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I then took a 2 mg bar of Xanax went to sleep and woke up the next day it was swollen and red face especially around my nose and my eyes. I rode out the rest of the withdrawals, being in a different country on vacation really seemed to help, especially when paws kicked in bc with a new adventure everyday, there was little time to sit around and dwell on everything that runs thru your head during paws. Anyway as soon as I returned home to nyc I relapsed (shocker). That was about 1.5 yrs ago. Now, after having 3 months clean from nov- end of January, I‚Äôm almost 8 months deep into daily use and back around 180mg/day, some days up to 240-300mgs. Need at least 150 to feel normal, plus 30mgs of adderall (especially during work week) or else I can‚Äôt even begin to do any work at all. Usually all snorted, sometimes I will eat them, but as you can imagine, this isn‚Äôt sustainable. The money isn‚Äôt even the main the catalyst behind my desire to quit. I am just so tired of this lifestyle and being a slave to the pill that I need to get off immediately. Anyone who has common experiences and can offer alternative methods or other insight it would be greatly appreciated. Also, between jumping and taking the subs, I took probably 8mg (4 - 2mg tablets) of loperamide - nothing excessive, just so I didn‚Äôt shit my pants constantly. Is it possible that little amount of lope could‚Äôve triggered precipitated wd‚Äôs? I‚Äôd say my last ‚Äúdose‚Äù of lope was maybe only 8 hours max before I took the first sliver of sub.

I laugh when I imagine the sorts of risk I put myself through (od, heart infections, MRSA,...) , especially when I was shooting up multiple times a day for several months.  Yet, I was completely fearless during that whole process (even when I was messing with pure fent).   

I also have an intense fear of the death-like state you're in when doctors put you under general anesthesia, but of course, shooting up drugs is precisely the kind of activity that put you at risk for that kind of ""lights out, you're dead"" kind of death.

My sweet spot for ~2 years was 20mg of opana twice a day. Usually 7-12hr apart. I had a traumatic situation happen and my use for the first time in a decade of use, got out of control.

I started doing 40-60mg of opana, sometimes 80mg. Doing entire pills in one line. I even tried sniffing dope twice. After about 60 days of a huge increase in use it hit me that this was insane so I tried to taper. Here is what I did

80mg- day 1
60mg- day 2
10mg day 3 (where it really starts)
Day 4-Nothing but 15-16 grams of Kratom. A lot I know. I still felt bad as hell.
Day 5- 90mg Percocet
Day 6- 75mg percocet
Day 7- 60mg percocet

The last one was over a month ago when a bought a bundle. 

Im 19 and have a very long history of clinical depression, a very dysfunctional family, and lots of bullying throughout high school.  I‚Äôve been able to stay away from it due to my absolute hatred of withdrawal and letting people down.

The reason I am feeling a relapse coming is because my older brother, my role model, the only person who can truly make me happy on a whim, and also a previous opiate addict just let me down big time.  I won‚Äôt get into it because this post is already long enough,  but I need to know, how do those of you who are sober stay sober? Like how? It seems impossible.   Like the inevitable is always creeping up on the horizon just waiting for me.

Thanks for reading my rant.  I‚Äôm crying as I type this because I just hate myself and hate my life.  Anyone who relates or any replies are welcome.  This Friday I‚Äôll have money, but until then, I can‚Äôt do anything yet.  The temptation is eating me alive.  ",1532891669.0

Codiene is my thing. I've been using it very sparingly (once every two weeks or more, only 3 x 30mg tablets at a time) on a friday night to relax and chill out.

One week I was working away from home and hit the stuff every day for a week straight out of boredom. Stopped at the end of the week and experienced the withdrawal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, restlessness).

I haven't touched the stuff in over two months now. If I was to indulge myself again once every few weeks with a small amount, would I experience those withdrawal symptoms again? Or do they only happen after a prolonged period of use (like a week straight).

Many thanks! ",1532881107.0

Last night I took like 35mg codiene and got some good sleep and for the first time in a long time even before I got on opiates for pain I felt happy and clear minded and I want that feeling back. If I slowly decrease my tramadol usage will things go back to normal? Will I ever be the same again and still be able to live with normal emotions.

After feeling true emotions this morning I‚Äôm just worried that even if I stop now they‚Äôll never come back

We were friends with this dude when we first got into the game (me and bf). We‚Äôre pretty good at turning dealers into friends. Took him to court dates, picked him up when his crazy gf dropped him on the side of the road (worth mentioning she‚Äôs stabbed him TWICE and he‚Äôs still with her??) helped each other out whenever we could. Didn‚Äôt hear from him for over a year, turns out he went back to prison.  Meet up again, he‚Äôs got a bay now and still with this crazy bitch. We decide to try out a tester for free. He ends up throwing some xtra shit in and saying we owe $30. Which I told him to take back cause I had it before and it was shitty shit and I didn‚Äôt have money üòÇ 

Anyways, none of the product was good. We ended up having to take an emergency trip out of town. Should be cool, we‚Äôll pay when we get back even though that is wasn‚Äôt the deal. Dude blows us up for 5 days threatening us and shit over $30. He‚Äôs never been this way before. I told him if he can‚Äôt calm down he won‚Äôt ever see us again, and that‚Äôs what happened. This was three months ago. 

Queue yesterday, I‚Äôm driving around town by myself and missed a road I needed. Pulled into a car dealership to turn around (they were closed for the day). Car pulls in behind me. I‚Äôm like ok cool wait for them to move cause they got me blocked in and then I‚Äôll be ok my way. Noticed someone get out the car so now I‚Äôm thinking someone is getting dropped off, then they‚Äôll move and I can move. 

Next thing I know this crazy bitch is on my driver side screaming shit at me about money. I‚Äôm shocked and am like, ‚Äúwtf you talking bout?‚Äù He comes over laughing saying ‚ÄúI told ya‚Äôll I‚Äôd catch up to you where the fucks my money?‚Äù At this point I‚Äôm like oh shit, hit my lock door button and go to roll my window up cause it was cracked. Bitch instantly reached in and unlocks car and opens in within like two seconds time. My memory is a bit fuzzy but they‚Äôre trying to reach over me into my car and trying to pull me out still screaming about money and they got a baby blah blah. For some dumb reason I‚Äôm frozen in fright mode cause I don‚Äôt wanna right some crazy bitch who will stab her own bf. They find my money and take it, I‚Äôm screaming it was only $20 they can‚Äôt take ALL my money. He takes what he wants and throws the rest on the ground. I‚Äôm circling their car to get a license plate and they don‚Äôt fkn have any AND they‚Äôre baby is in the car. I‚Äôm just like WTF? 

They speed off so I have a brilliant idea to try to follow them and call the police. Cops don‚Äôt want nothing to do with it though. Say I gotta go back to where I was and they‚Äôll send someone to take a report or I gotta go to the station (which was coincidentally RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET from where I was robbed.) I‚Äôm like you can‚Äôt just follow these mother fuckers? So I stop following them cause I ain‚Äôt trying to die over $30 I‚Äôm just pissed they got in my car and basically assaulted me when they had their BABY with them. 

So half a fuckin hour later a cop shows up. I give them details. Leave out anything about it being drug related but tell them he‚Äôs a dealer straight out of prison who should be on parole. They can‚Äôt find him in their system with the name I give. üôÑüôÑ now I gotta talk to a detective on Monday. Apparently the car dealership has video evidence. I even thought of giving myself a black eye to turn it into assault but idk how far into my car any cameras can see. 

I‚Äôm just dumbfounded and shook over the whole thing. 

TL:DR; dont fuck with crazy. Also, I know I‚Äôm stupid. Im getting out of this game and trying to lead a new life. ",1532832845.0

I hear stories daily of extremely dangerous and dirty IV use patterns. I see the effects of infection and disease constantly and feel compelled to put together harm reduction kits to offer to people flying signs or to users I meet in my town (unfortunately I cannot give them out at work). I'll include cotton, caps, sterile water packs and alcohol wipes, although I have a question about syringe sizing. If it were for heroin use only I'd select 1cc 28/.5s, but I'm wondering if that would also work well for meth and pills.  What is a good multi substance rig? Also, extra points for a link to the cheapest on the net, in individually wrapped packages.  

Please let me know what else would be helpful in a care pack like this. Thank you very much for your input.

Hell I think the public is experiencing a kind of burn out on addiction, the first time someone you know fatally ODs is a big personal tragedy. The fifth time it happens they tend to get angry at the dead friend, or just annoyed.

Subs have reached mainstream awareness, I'm seeing them used in a lot of normie mainstream memes(white trash starter kit etc). This is NOT a good thing, nothing endangers maintenance therapy more than an ignorant public turning against it. Most people still seem to think the goal of subs is to get people clean for good. I honestly think the law passed allowing buprenorphine to be RXed for maintenance slipped through during a very ""liberal"" period during which RXs of opiates for pain also rose, I doubt bupe would get through today.

I think there is going to be a BIG push for that vivitrol implant, both by the manu and by drug courts etc as its more attractive being feel good free.

The FDA is regulating freaking loperamide sales, kratom already narrowly avoided scheduling but you can be sure they will be back. The war against opiates in pain control is still grinding on.

Street ""heroin"" is no longer actually heroin but fent the majority of the time, and I see this just ramping up. Its just too attractive to criminal orgs, cheap, compact for smuggling, potent, I could go on but street H being fent is here to stay.

Yea things aren't looking so good to me, the one I'm really kind of worried about is increased regulation on sub scripts or even a rearrangement of the concept of writing the scripts as usual. Kinda terrified of no legal easily accessible maintenance med with how badly I have fucked my brain over the years, I might be resourceful but its hard to keep it up forever.

EDIT:There was a recent post here on reddit, not in this sub, which showed some oddly dressed young bums? panhandling in front of a CVS. Top upvoted comment was speculating they needed money for their suboxone scripts, which had people laughing. That shit scares me.",1532826653.0

So basically, I no longer use heroin for a number of reasons, on Suboxone for 1+ yr with 1 lapse and 1 relapse in that time (best I've done in years). Ironically it was just a week ago that my household had a needle in it once again.

Anyway, I need to know the length in inches of syringes...I'm working on preliiiiminary ass blueprints for a device that, Godwilling, will make life easier for all you folks in the opiate world. But I don't work for any big company or whatever, Google et al provide me no answer, and as much as it'd seem the most convenient I'm not gonna go to the Riteaid and grab a rig just for this. If a water bottle cap or q-tip can cause that drop in my stomach, a needle will probably have me sprinting towards Philly before I can even get both my shoes on...

THUS, if anyone here has the time and would like to peripherally contribute to something that does the world good --undoing that shit karma that I and virtually all my other opiated friends have accumulated; I speak for myself, but I digress--thennn

Please find a ruler and let me know the measurements of your rigs. Specifically, I'd need to know and least how many cc/mL yours is, and also if you have the gauge and the needle length that would help as well. 
Then, the length in inches (or cm for the non-Americans on here, you're doing me a favor so I'll do the conversions myself) from where the needle protrudes from the barrel/the 0 unit mark up to where the plunger goes in (essentially, the length of the barrel).
In addition to this, I need the length between the bottom of the barrel/0 unit mark and the 10 unit mark.

These seemingly random things will actually help me greatly both to move forward with my project as well as not relapse in the process.



TL;DR
if you have a moment I need somebody to measure a couple things on their syringes with a ruler
