So I recently decided that I wanted to try poppy seed tea. Did some looking around on here than decided to hit up Target for the Archer Farms seeds. Come to find out all the spices are full than there's the poppy seed slot... Empty. I mean hey someone's putting them to good us right? Haha. Fast forward 10 minutes later I'm at Kroger unable to locate them. When I ask for help he brings me to them but again, the slots completely empty. The dude I asked was a real nice guy, Idk if he knew what was up or not but he decided to get a cashier to ring me up with two McCormick's which would've been like 10 bucks, but for like $2.50. They're useless to me cause they're washed I'll probably set them in the cabinet to be untouched lol. I'm impressed by that employee's going out of his way to hook it up for me even though it was just some poppy seeds.  But yea at this point I'm like ""fuck it I'll just use Amazon.""

Well, I finally dragged my ass out of bed after 2 1/2 days of misery to go to my shitty 3rd shift job and let me tell you, it was Hell. I wasn't really sure I'd make it through the night. About an hour after my shift started, my old landlord came in and threw me a perc 10. I don't know if it was placebo or what, but I was feeling about 75% better. 

2 hours later the dboy calls and asks me if I need a treat. I tell him I don't have any cash but he days he'll be by soon. Comes in and throws me .15. Now I'm trying not to drag my ads across the carpet to scratch my bunghole. 

What a wonderful day! I'm going to try to kick again starting today. Hopefully this little taper will take some of the edge off the oncoming withdrawals.

He was the father I never had.) died 3 years ago. I won't go into specifics, but he was in some pain leading up to his death. His doctor would prescribe him hydrocodone 5/325's for his pain. However, he would seldom take them, for two reasons. 

Firstly because he said he didn't like how drowsy they made him, but secondly, and mainly, because he was tough as fucking nails. In life, I had seen him do shit like accidentally grind the flesh off his finger while sharpening a blade and finish sharpening the blade before doing anything about the giant gash. He was just seriously really tough. But he was not a dick, he had a meek and wise personality. Taught me a lot about a lot of things.

Anyways, I Digress too much... I figured since he did not typically TAKE the hydros, but he still filled the scripts, that there must be some somewhere... but where?

Today I was helping my Grandmother clean and organize a part of her house. I opened a lower cabinet in the master bathroom. There was a plastic pan for holding things; it was full of soaps and other hygiene products. On top was a white paper sack. I thought nothing of it as I picked it up until I heard  the contents emit a familiar rattle..! My heart jumped.

I poured out the bag... Antibiotics, hmm... Prednisone.. not looking good. hmmm ok this one's... Promethazine! nice! not an opiate, but very useful. Then all back to back... bottle of 7 5/500 hydros. OH SNAP! I'm on the trail... next a bottle of 6 5/325 hydros! fuck yeah! ok last bottle... hmmm.. woah it's heavy.. ohfuck! it's a bottle of (which I immediately counted) of 60 5/325 hydro's! HOLYFUCK! 

I asked my grandmother about them and she told me to ""just go ahead and flush them."" So I did.


Yeha right, no the FUCK I did NOT. Anyways -- HOLY SHIT! 73 5mg hydros?! SEVENTY-FUCKING-THREE?! Hell yes! Not to mention the 26 promethazine tablets!

And yes, I will of course be  very cautious with Acetaminophen intake. But yay I'm so excited! So many highs! :D

TL;DR: Found my late Grandfather's old hydro's, ends up being a shitload of them, life is great, etc.

So I obviously took your guy's advice and called my aunt. I called her on Thursday morning, and acted concerned that some of my baclofin were missing. I told her to make sure her pills were still accounted for and she said she would and that she was sorry that happened blah blah blah. Not even 10 minutes later she calls me back telling me she was missing hers but she also had ""these pills that look exactly the same"" *cue fake confusion* I asked her what they looked like and said id look them up. When I told her that they were my missing pills she immediately starting defending herself saying she'd never do that. So I lead her to her own conclusion of it being my cousin. I asked who knew about them and she obviously said ""well tasha does but she wouldn't..."" I then told her that she was in the coat room when I took my pills. I faked the ""are you sure?"" She immediately jumped on it.  

I gets better.

I suggested to her ""well are you sure it was her and not her bf pressuring her?"" *insert shocked statements here* My aunt had NO IDEA she was seeing anyone, which shocked me because I figured she'd at least know she was dating or whatever. Whoops. Oh well. And I admitted to mu aunt that i didnt tell her cos i assumed she knew. And i apologized.  So I covered Tasha stealing the pills, and her having a bf. I didn't !mention her trying to murder me BUT I'm glad I didn't. 

Thursday evening: apparently after my cousin got home from school my aunt lit her the fuck up. How I found out? The very very threatening vm I got from her while I was in the shower. In a nutshell: I'll find you, I'll kill you, fucking cunt, and watch your back. Honestly, this concerned me considering she did try to switch pills on me. But then again, she's 14 with no car and has no idea where I live, or so I thought. 

Thursday night: I tell my aunt about the vm. We plan to meet the next day.

Friday morning: I let my aunt listen to the message, she's concerned, counseling. Same shit I'd hope to here. Meanwhile, my cousin is grounded for life. I told her I was concerned about the message and she assured me everything would be OK.

Friday night: I hadn't heard from my aunt at all since the morning and I figured everything had been handled. Wrong.  Get home to find a huge mess of cop cars in our parking lot. Great. Lo and behold they taking evidence from the front of my apartment door. The carpet in front of my door was tore up. Someone spray painted TR8TR and apparently attempted to break in. WTF. When I alerted them that I was the one who lived there they immediately dragged me downstairs. They tell me not to worry, that they caught who it was and that if I press charges I won't pay for any damages.  It was the psychos even more psychotic bf. Fuck me, right? So I tell them what had happened with my cousin, let the cop listen to my vm and told them that she had to be involved. Turns out they planned on questioning her as well based on her bf ratting her out saying it was her idea but she wasn't home. Or no where to be found. Great. They offered a Leo to watch my place, I declined simply because it just makes me uncomfortable. 

Saturday morning:  aunt calls me freaking out, asking if I saw her blah blah blah. No. I wish. Because fuck this little twat for making my life difficult when she just needs fucking help. 

Monday (yesterday) 2am: my aunt calls saying they found her (thank god I was worried she was fucking raped or kidnapped) but they were taking her to juvy.

Today: (I didn't contact her to ask because I really didn't care at this point, she called me) I found out her bond was OR with an ankle monitor, but as soon as they went grocery shopping later that day (Monday) she took off. It took 20 minutes find her. Now she's sitting in juvy with a 4k bond (my aunt needs 400 to get her out) and SHE CALLED ME FOR MONEY!!! 

So I'm sitting here asking myself if it was all really worth it. 

Bonus: her bf was 17 so he's being charged as an adult for a felony. They're considering charging her as an adult from what my aunt said? No idea how that works.

Did the lorazepams curb the cravings too?

By now, on day 2 without ANYTHING, I'd be in an ungodly pissed off mood, yawning 24/7, tearing, dysphoria, the works.. But I am actually supper content right now and I don't even care about scoring to be honest.

Oh right, I should mention I took 4 of the .5 ones, so 2mg total this morning, about 7 hours ago and I still going strong.. This is amazing, gonna save them for as long as I can for days like this when I'm broke and can't score.

I've read that it's feasible with some basic ingredients (https://pay.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2mverd/do_you_guys_ever_cook_home_bake_from_mscontin/) and there's a dude who sells ""RonPaul cookbooks"" but he's asking for literally $1500 just for a pdf yeah I don't think so. I know where to get acetic anhydride, and I've got 435mg of MS Contin to work with here. So if the procedure is within my ability and I can get a decent yield of diamorphine (at least 150mg), I see no reason not to do it. Especially if the finished product is pure enough to the point that I can dissolve my desired amount in 100CCs of hypertonic saline, which brings me to my 2nd question:



How on earth can I get a decent amount of these pills (at least 6, or 90+mg) into 1ml of liquid? 

I just cleaned the dye off 6 pills, dried them with a napkin, crushed them as finely as I could with a mortar and pestle, dumped it in a spoon that was way too small, squirted a little over 1ml in, realized that wasn't very smart, then spent a great deal of time separating the mixture with a larger spoon, diluting it over and over, until eventually I got two syringes filled with what I could salvage. No idea how much I just did, although I was more satisfied with the feeling than I would have expected. Is there a way to extract the morphine from the fillers and binders so it'll dissolve in 100CCs or less? 90mg isn't even that many, well I guess it might be equivalent to 18mg of dilaudid which is kind of a lot, but...anyway, please help, I don't want to keep wasting pills if I don't have to.

Perhaps a man acts selfishly for reasons he does not understand, but it is his past (if not a mental disorder) that has caused his actions.

People do good things as a result of good intentions, taught to them by their environment.

People do bad things because they believe their intentions are good, or feel like they’ve been taught not to care whether they do good or bad.

Good people and bad people are the same. They are each a victim of circumstance.

We will never fully understand why we do the things we do, but look at mass murderers on T.V. Even Osama bin Laden’s actions were an attempt to create what he thought would be a better world for his family and his people (and likely to seem more powerful, but he would not carry these intentions if he was not taught the value of true power).

This is not an invitation to avoid guilt, but instead encouragement to evaluate what is important to you … and why. Your actions depend on what life goals you find to be most important.
I pray that after we pass on, we’ll have this explained to us. In the meantime, forgive your brother. Your “best friend” who ripped you off, that crackhead always asking for change for “the train” or a “phone call,” even though he’s spending that money directly on drugs.

My main message here is that for those of you who feel guilty for your use, don’t feel guilty but hopefully do something about it. Something drove you to use (as I’m sure you all know, even if you’re not exactly sure what it was), but you’ll never find peace with it unless you approach it with a clean mind.

If you’re still planning on using then go right ahead, but please realize that for every hurtful thing you do (hurt family members, stealing), there’s a reason behind it.

To my brothers in recovery, don’t feel guilty. You are responsible for maybe 1% of the things that shaped (and continue to shape) your life. Keep fighting the good fight.

To my brothers still using, nod on. Staying high for the rest of your life to escape your problems can be a decision of yours, but please consider a break at some point that’s long enough to start to reach and deal with your inner issues.. I may have an excuse to continue using (which I do), but I think it's starting to become time to evaluate what is most important in life (a good job, staying musically active, and *most* importantly, **family.**

Y’all have helped me through so much, and I love you all. Good luck to everyone in their decisions, just don't let guilt bring you down. <3

As we are talking I notice the tracks on her arms and hands and begin to also notice she's rather sick. Initially I thought she had a cold until I saw the tracks and realized she was in withdraws. I reach into my pocket and pull out half a bun of some fire bags I had and handed it to her. Her face lit up.  She thanked me with a hug and said she didn't think she was going to be able to get well today.  Most non user would scoff at this but I'm happy I was able to help a fellow user out. Everyone's been down on their luck and I put a smile on her face. Made me feel good to help her out especially because lately I've felt like a selfish asshole in life.

My biggest shot was 40mgs. 20 2mg pills.  I had a PICC line in to administer myself antibiotics.

It enters in your upper arm and is fed through the vein and stops just before your heart. They are about 40cm long.

Along with the PICC line you get 10cc syringes filled with saline to flush the line after an antibiotic. They use a luer lock. All I have to do is screw on the syringe to the line and inject away.  I used these 10cc syringes to shoot the dilaudid.

I started at 2 mg and kept going up 2mg at a time. 2,4,6,8, etc.  My last shot was a full 40mg of dilaudid. I ran out of pills or I would have done more.

The conclusion was that the natural intelligence of the body learns to expect large doses of opiates in certain environments (aka your house or favorite place to get high) and your body ""gears up"" in preperation for the dope when you get high in these regular spots. This doesn't happen when you take large doses of opiates in foreign locations, leading to a higher risk of overdose. 

I've certainly experienced something along these lines myself... thinking back, all my close calls were in foreign surroundings, whereas I've done much larger amounts at home and not had a problem. Interesting stuff and worthy of discussion. I'll try to find a link to the study.",1442570632.0

I've had bad experiences on opiates, especially the second to last time. About six months ago, I found some of these tablet type things in my medicine cabinet from Australia that contained codeine. They were like alca selzer so you put them in water and they dissolve. The amount of codeine was extremely small so I had to take like twenty of them. It was so gross I'm honestly getting sick thinking of the smell right now and I don't even like to think about it. 


I got sick off of this and threw up and haven't touched opiates since. It was a really bad experience for me.


Then, about a month ago, I decided to get shitfaced drunk, even though I barely ever drink, and take a bunch of tramadol. I wake up in the middle of the night so so sick. Over the course of the next twelve hours, I would proceed to throw up over twenty times. Since I hadn't eaten  anything, after the first couple pukes my stomach was empty. What happened after this were about twenty extremely painful dry pukes where I would only puke up stomach acid. It sucked :( I couldn't keep anything down, not even water. I almost went to the hospital. 


I know this wasn't just from the alcohol. Whenever I'm hungover I'll puke once and immediately feel better. There was no relief this time. Only twelve hours of hell, sleeping the whole time and waking up every twenty minutes in delirium to roll over and heave up stomach acid into a water bottle. 


The other few times that I've done opiates they were alright I guess but I never got anything close to euphoria or any of the other awesome effects that I hear y'all talking about. From what I remember, all it did was make me sleepy and have some extremely vivid and bizarre dreams. 


So now I'm wondering what to do with these pills. They've been sitting behind my dresser untouched for the past two weeks and I don't know anybody that I could sell them to (me and my friends mostly just smoke cannabis). I kind of want to take some but I'm really afraid of getting sick and having another horrendous ordeal. 


Im thinking of taking two Vicodins and two Promethazines. I've heard that Promethazine potentiates opiates and makes it so that you don't get nauseous. Is this true? 


Basically, I need help. I want to enjoy these pills but I don't know how. How should I take them so that I can enjoy the fun effects that I always hear about? What are things that are nice to do while high on this stuff? Is it possible to get a spiritual-like experience off it like I do when I smoke cannabis, close my eyes, and listen to Pink Floyd?


Also, should these be taken during the day or at night and should I be tired or awake and alert before taking them? 


ps. I've seen it recommended that you smoke cannabis while taking opiates to decrease nausea and have a better time. Unfortunately, this will be impossible for me as I will not have any until this weekend. If I did, I wouldn't consider doing this as I'm afraid of getting sick again.",1442566381.0

Life happened, and rather than end up a dead person, I decided, I need to go back on Subs and get some clarity and use that time to figure out what is going on.

Long story of no friends, finding one friend, who was fucking me ex behind my back the entire time I was hanging out with him every day.  caught them mid-act, and this is all tip of the iceberg story stuff, my brain exploded and I couldn't deal with it all.

My insurance only has 1 Dr that can Rx Suboxone.  I have always had bad like with Suboxone in the past.  Finally, I had a Dr in the past that gave me Subutex, so it doesn't have that 2mg of Naloxone.  The Naloxone gives me severe depression, some of the worst I have ever had, feels like PAWS but times about 2.

I asked to be switched to Subutex, took them a week to get back to me, meanwhile, I am suffering a deep despair in bed all week, missing a wedding i was to be best man in, etc.

They call, and the Dr. has a policy that he will only do Subutex for pregnant women.  I don't get it, if I am having an adverse reaction, even reading the sheet of warnings the paperwork comes with, depression is listed as a side-effect and says to call Dr. Immediately and figure it out.

So, without ability to get  a simple brand change, I don't know what to do.  I am going to end up paying out of pocket to see a pain management specialist or a local Sub Dr.  And they may have the same stupid policies.


Any suggestions on what to do?  Any way to get that Nalxone out of the pill?  It's like they don't believe me.  I don't get it, if I am on Subs, I can't even take other opiates/opiods, as it blocks them enough that I won't feel anything.  And after a few years of clean time, my tolerance is probably back to normal.  I am only taking 4mg of the Subutex as well, and am working to cut that to 2, than start doing micro tapers, that is why I started seeing this new Dr.

i self started on the Subutex as I had about a months supply laying around from years ago.  But no, I am desperately nearing being out of those, and have a near full bottle of the 8mg/2mg type, with no good use for the, as they make me worse off, not better.",1442559465.0

This is a time when I got cleaned up off heroin and lived in a clean and sober house. So much crazy shit happened there I could probably write a book lol so here's just one story about Robert. There are many more stories about Robert but this is one. Read it, don't read it, whatever, I love this sub and all of you so if you're bored...here you go. Sorry it's so long. 


********************


Robert is sitting flat eyed at the dining room table taking bites out of a cheeseburger with a grease-stained paper bag set in front of him.  This sight makes me recoil back into the bedroom and almost shut the door. I can't comprehend why he is back here. A white plasticky hospital bracelet dangles from his wrist as he ignores all but his meal in front of him. Things would get much worse, incredibly so, but I didn't know it yet.  It's just past 1 am. The events of the evening made time slip by so quickly. I don't work tomorrow, fuck it, I think, and proceed to sink down into a sitting position on the edge of the mattress with the door ajar so I can see Robert in the dining room. Dylan and Art are talking on the porch, I strain to hear what they're saying and press my face against the screen in the window to listen.


Hours earlier, when the sun had just barely set so it was dark out but not too cold yet, we stood in the kitchen. Happy John brought a pizza home for everyone to share. It was a weird pizza, covered in pieces of bacon and sausage. The crust was too chewy, too thin and lukewarm. But it was free. Dylan looked up with a mouthful of pizza and chewed on his words.


""Where's Robert? "" he asked noncommitaly. As house manager,  he was responsible for doling out Roberts meds. Once in the morning, once at night. Lately he has been having me hand Robert his medication, with a glass of water and a kindly forced smile.


""Here's your meds, dude"" I say smiling but I don't look into his eyes. Robert hates women. He likes pussy, and has an unhealthy and flagrant passion for porn, but as people he distrusts and loathes females. Maybe it's because of his mother. His mom,  who dropped Robert off in Arts driveway and sped away leaving tire marks in the gravel. She couldn't handle him anymore. 32 years of dealing with Robert I couldn't imagine, but...Still. What a bitch. She will pay his bills to displace her guilt,  I guess. Dylan thinks this will be good for us, that he will trust me more, if I deliver the medicine. He trusts Dylan and also mistakenly believes that Dylan owns this house we live in, and that he is in charge. The only person in charge above him is Art. Robert loves Art. He would absolutely kill for him and I know it.


But tonight during med time Robert is not present. He's not on the porch smoking hand rolled cigarettes and he's not in the bathroom. I rise from the couch in the sitting room and walk over to the fridge. Opening it to retrieve a soda, the shelves are bare.


""What the fuck?"" I recoil and back my head out of the fridge to stare at everyone eating pizza oblivious. 


""Why is the fridge empty?"" I inquire. 


This house has 15 people living in it. The shelves are never empty, thanks to every last one of us being on food stamps. Food is frequently pilfered and exchanged but is never completely *gone*. 


I open the second fridge on the other side of the counter. Less dire here, but still more barren than usual and certainly not containing the missing food from fridge #1. I throw the door of the Community food cupboard open with a gasp. All of the canned food is gone. What the fuck?


The side screen door to the kitchen opens and Grizzly John walks in. He is large, muscular and fit, with a huge beard and sideburns. But Grizzly John has a goofy smile and drawl in his voice. He's a kind guy. 


""Robert threw all of the food out."" He states in an amused tone. 


""What?!"" I shriek, ""Where? Why didn't you stop him?""


Grizzly John still has a bemused smile on. Robert told him he was cleaning the fridge. He left it alone. Now there are two huge Rubbermaid trash bins outside filled with our food. That part he missed. 


""I didn't think he was throwing it away,"" states Grizzly John. He's not the smartest man ever but Robert always does odd things. He can't be blamed. 


The first time I met Robert, no one warned me that he was a severe schizophrenic, or in laymans terms batshit crazy. I walked into the house and into the sitting room to find Dylan. Instead I find Robert, staring intently at whatever is on the big screen television. The TV is off.


""Hi,"" I say as I walk through his line of sight. I am used to people I don't know here, constantly. In a clean and sober house such as ours there is always someone new, someone old and returning for a visit, friends of roommates, family of roommates...Robert doesn't respond but I find everyone else in the den next to the kitchen. A few minutes later I walk into the bathroom and lean to pull the door shut, and in shock see Robert standing close behind me in the way of the door. He looks at me like a junkie in withdrawal looks at a bag of dope. I lean the opposite direction with a frown.


""Do you wanna have sex now?"" Robert inquires simply, not really looking at me, or anything, anymore.
 

""What the fuck?"" I inquire back. I shut the door and lock it, still confused. It must be this guy's idea of a joke, except we haven't met yet and that seems rude. When I emerge from the bathroom to my relief he's not outside the door. I tell Dylan I'm going to smoke and then take a nap, over my shoulder as I open the screen door to the porch. Suddenly I feel arms grasp me from behind and a hot breath on my neck. 


""Can I come take a nap too?"" Asks the voice strangely. But it's not Dylans voice and the arms grab me too roughly. I spin around in anger and shove Robert off of me. Once the situation was explained to me it took everything Dylan had to not beat Roberts ass. I'm glad at least the physical altercation was avoided, because as we would later learn, Robert had superhuman strength once he went into violence mode. 


Dylan stands from the couch and coffee table, chewing his last bite of pizza. Roberts voice comes from the front porch. Ah. He's back. Hopefully he wasn't in the neighbors yard again, on their porch. They don't like that too much. He's calling Dylan outside, says he wants to show him something. 


I'm in conversation with the others, eating and sitting and winding down our day for several minutes. Suddenly the screen door slams open and BANG hits the wall in the neighboring room. Bellows come from the porch and we all stand, searching each other's faces for an explanation. Happy John and I briskly switch rooms and find Dylan doubled over, pawing at his face and Robert is nowhere. 


Robert has spells. Episodes, you could call them. Where he freaks out a little, does odd things or offends someone who doesn't (or sometimes even does) know him. Like the time he stripped naked and we found him on the side of the house spray painting himself with a can of spray paint stolen from the garage. He had already sprayed his old black Nike sneakers and now was concentrating on himself. 


""Dylan, look! I have blue balls!"" Cackled Robert while Dylan looked on in horror. He continued laughing and spraying his nude body a brilliant shade of azure, oblivious to the crowd that gathered on the front lawn. The neighbors called the police, of course, but by the time they got there Dylan had him calmed down and clothed, indoors again. The cops just laughed at the recounting of the tale. They laughed, and said he wasn't hurting anyone, so they couldn't do anything like arrest him or take him somewhere. It was apparent to me long before this that Robert needed specialized help, and that was something we could not provide, but the resources in our state are limited and most places would only hold him for 48 hours then turn him back out onto the streets. Art had a soft spot for Robert and so he stayed. I never knew exactly why, but I do know that Robert smoked far too much crack and did far too much ex and his mind never recovered. I think Art saw that it could have been him in Roberts place had he not gotten clean. 


So I rush to Dylans side, my hand on his bent-over back. 


""What happened??"" I ask. 


""He threw a bunch of dirt and rocks in my face,"" Dylan replied, standing up straight watery-eyed and rubbing at his eyes with his knuckles. 


Robert was not usually violent. His *happenings* were happening more frequently now, and in shorter intervals. Sometimes his meds would quit working and the doctors would change the dose, change the prescription. It just kept him stable most of the time. All of this in one day was an ominous cry for attention, or help. Things in Roberts world weren't the same as ours. Usually his spells were limited to him rambling that someone in the house wanted to cut off his dick, or rape him, or other such graphic nonsense. These ramblings were constricted, however, to the living room couch that Robert slept on and only heard by ears passing through on their way in or out of the front door. The things that Robert said he truly believed. He thought his thoughts were real. Perceived danger was always lurking for him, another abandonment or betrayal. Most of the time, given you knew he was crazy, Robert seemed to be able to hold normal conversations and blended into the background, sitting on the couch staring at the TV or conked out after his med dose. We were just used to Robert being Robert. He carried a plastic toy bucket, like one would play with at the beach, filled with tobacco for rolling cigarettes. On top of the mound of tobacco were two tiny plastic monster trucks. They were always in the bucket, as if the brown tobacco was a pile of dirt they drove back and forth on. Occasionally an action figure would be added in the mix and Robert would excitedly show you his new prize from the dollar store. Taking Robert anywhere was a rare occurrence because he would act up in public, and do or say insanely inappropriate things. Art was really the only one who could keep him fully in control. 


Dylan righted himself and stood up straight. 


""I gotta go find him."" He stated. It was dark out and Robert out in the neighborhood in a fit after dark was bad. Happy John and Dylan leave to search for him while Grizzly John and I retire back to the den. Before too long, Grizzly John goes outside and I do dishes at the sink. 


""HEY,"" Grizzly yells into the screen door next to me several minutes later, startling me enough that I almost drop the soapy plate I am handling. 


""Come outside, now!"" Grizzly shouts. Alarmed I step onto the side porch. Grizzly is running up the driveway. 


""Robert is at IGA freaking out and breaking shit!"" He says wide eyed, over his shoulder as he runs. I grab my purse and keys, and climb into the drivers seat of my shiny black hatchback. Grizzly John backtracks several steps and throws himself into the passenger seat. IGA food mart is literally 3 or 4 houses up and around the corner, but I want to drive. We pull into the parking lot and I immediately see Art's Nissan parked there. I sigh in relief. Art will handle Robert.


We emerge from the vehicle to a scene. Shattered glass lays sparkling on the sidewalk reflecting the orangey street lights that illuminate the parking lot. Fireman from the fire station directly next to our house mill around the IGA entrance with employees from the store and would-be customers. I peer in and see Art standing, arms spread open non-threateningly, at the end of an aisle inside the store. The fireman holds a forearm out to stop me. 


""You can't shop right now, ma'am."" He states firmly. I shake my head at him and Grizzly John follows close behind me. We're his roommates, I state. The firemen stand back, looking almost amused. 


""Why aren't you guys in there?"" I snap, leveling my gaze at the two standing arms-crossed outside the door. 


""We have to wait for the police if it's a violent individual,"" replies the other. I shake him off again. 


""Robert's not vio-""


CRASH


SMASH


The tinkling sound of glass breaking like little sharp bells jerks my attention back inside the store. A sour smell creeps into my nostrils. Robert was smashing bottles of wine, while Art waved his arms wildly. 


""ROBERT! Stop, buddy! Come here!"" Pleads Art. Dylan stands at the opposite end of the aisle, trapping Robert like a pacing lion between the two. 


""THEY'RE TRYING TO FUCKING KILL ME!"" Screams Robert. 


""THEY WANNA CUT MY FUCKING DICK OFF AND THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME!""


A short Mexican lady looks on annoyed, huffs and then waddles back to her pearl white Escalade. She gets in but doesn't leave. Other customers are much more invested in this saga unfolding before them, and continue to stand with us, the firemen, and two employees of IGA in dark green aprons.


""Robert, buddy, no one wants to kill you, we love you, man!"" Says Art exasperated. He slowly walks in Roberts direction, like circling a wild animal, hands still up and palms open. 


""Where are the fucking police?"" I ask no one in particular. By this time Grizzly John has entered the store as back up. 


Art approaches Robert slowly, talking to him in a low voice. Then it happens. Art gets within arms reach of Robert, and reaches out and grasps both sides of Roberts face. He pulls him to him and they touch foreheads. I can't hear what Art is saying. He continues to speak lowly, his forehead up against Roberts. Tears spring up behind my eyes. An intense bond passes between them and its almost visible as Robert gives up and quiets his yelling, sagging into Art's body as he pulls him. Dylan trails behind them as Art walks Robert out of the store, arm slung over his shoulders. 


""It's alright, man, we love you."" Art repeats as they move over broken glass and exit the store. The customers and employees scatter from the entrance like a shark passes through a school of fish. Art locks eyes with me and I shoo everyone away from the trio that exits now. Robert has his back to the concrete wall outside and slides down sitting next to Art. 


The police finally show up. I am not a fan of cops by any means but these ones are human. They try to understand that Robert is just classically crazy. The IGA employees are apparently human too; they don't want to press charges just want the broken windows and merchandise paid for...and it's probably best that Robert not return to shop here. I roll my eyes. That's a given. Dylan, Grizzly John and I drive back to the house per Art's request and leave them there. I see the two in my rear view mirror, still sitting against the concrete, Art's arm still slung protectively over Roberts shoulders. 


The cops take Robert up the street to St. Francis, the local hospital. Grizzly John is outside in the driveway, salvaging what canned food he can rinse and return to our now-humble cupboards. It's almost cute, big Grizzly John digging through black trash bags for canned corn and pineapple juice, placing the saveable ones in a pile on the lawn.  Hours later Art and Robert return to the house, Robert clutching a bag of fast food, still wearing his plastic hospital identification band. I am slightly shocked but not quite incredulous at the fact that they released him so soon. Although he threw rocks through the store windows and broke bottles, he didn't actually hurt anyone as far as they knew. Dylan didn't mention the gravel that was thrown in his face. 


Dylan and Art return from the porch. Now Robert looks up. 


""Dylan?"" Asks Robert. 


""Yes, Robert."" Sighs Dylan in response. 


""You're not gonna kick me out, are you? I'm sorry."" Says Robert. And he is human again. A half smile spreads across Dylan's tired face.


""No, buddy. No one is kicking you out.""",1442551914.0

I have a low-moderate tolerance at this point and was just ended a butyr fentanyl binge 6 days ago and this shit is still very nice!

If you are the type to have things on stand by to combat withdrawals, this shit would be my number one recommendation outside of something like Suboxone. It definitely feels much better and stronger than even massive doses of kratom that I have taken. The only down side is it has a short half life making the peak not last long.

One of my good friends recently told me that she's been a long term opiate user and said that she felt like I should know this about her if we were going to continue to be friends. Honestly this caught me off guard because whatever mental image I had about opiate and hard narcotic drug use completely changed when my close friend confided in me her secret addiction. It took me a few days to process and decide to continue being friends with her. 

When it comes to opiates I am completely ignorant and the hardest drugs I've ever taken is alcohol and weed (college days). I always assumed that once you take opiates that you stop functioning as a part of society and begin a downward spiral towards oblivion. But from the lifestyle my friend lives and from reading stories on this sub I've come to understand that there is some middle ground between opiate addiction and social standing in society. 

Ideally I'd love nothing more than for my friend to quit opiates cold turkey but that is not something that I should force on her or something I'd want forced on me in her situation. I did some online reading about how opiates work and then read a lot on this sub of the daily struggles most of you go through in order to just be functioning adults. And then it hit me, that everyone at some level has some level of addiction to something. For instance I am addicted to technology I can't help myself when something new and shinny comes out I have to own it, I get a instant high from it and it quickly dulls out and then I find myself wanting my next fix. Others are addicted to video games, sex, the gym, pornography and the list goes on. 

I then thought about the difference between the addictions I have and the addiction my friend has and that is when it hit me, as a society we've chosen to regulate your addiction and leave my addiction unregulated. I was reading online that the biggest issue for you opiate users is having a reliable pure source of whatever it is you take. If you guys could source your addiction at a reasonable rate without all the drama in between you'd be just like anyone else, completely functional. 


I want to understand what life is like through my friends addiction to better understand how I can be a good friend to her. I never thought that I'd be a person who'd accept an opiate user as a friend but honestly I never thought opiate users could be so normal. 

So here are a few questions I have:


1. When you are without your fix how shitty does this feel, can you describe this from the point of view of someone who knows nothing about opiates. 


2. How frequently do you have to source your drug of choice, does tolerance build up fast? 

3. What daily issues do you run into because of your addiction?

4. Do your non-opiate friends know about your addiction?

5. What is the best way I can emotionally support my friend?",1442515449.0

Hi, My name is Nick and I work at a needle exchange in NYC (http://cornerproject.org/). I've developed a survey for people who inject drugs as a way of building a case for expanding syringe access to include providing safer injecting supplies via mail, free of charge. As you all probably know, Tracey has been doing a fine job sending people supplies but her reach is very limited due to the lack of funding for such a thing. I'm trying my best to change that. I'm originally from Australia where injecting supplies are free and very accessible. It blows my mind reading people's stories about having to buy syringes, or having to travel hours to a needle exchange (if your state even has one). Ideally, i'd like to set up an online needle exchange where people can place orders discreetly and receive what they need free of charge. We're a long way from that happening but we've gotta start somewhere. The survey only takes a few minutes to fill out and asks questions about how you get your injecting supplies, what drugs you use, if you re-use needles etc. It would be great if the injectors on this sub (USA only) could take the time to fill it out. Please hit me up if you have any questions. Thanks, Nick. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YTmk5y8j5qGSTz5zdf4Zaf4sUoOZoB9LiBTbKeiFHjc/viewform?c=0&w=1

A bit more nuanced situation.","Have a potentially busy but somewhat flexible schedule this upcoming week that may or may not involve some travel, visiting family, etc. I'm trying to better understand my current dependency situation so I can prepare and plan appropriately.

Opiate background &amp; current usage (updated/shortened)

Past usage:
  - 5 year on/off opiate addiction with 3years of sub maintenance mixed in
Most recent long-term usage (4 months):
  - Daily H use at 2bun/day for 2 months, preceded by 2 months of daily oxy use
      - Detoxed in August, made it 12 days clean until my current relapse
Current relapse (10-11 days):
  - After 12 days clean, relapsed to a 1 bun/day H habit for past 10-11 days


My question is, how does that recent detox and 12-day clean period affect my current dependency situation, if at all?
Should I be expecting the upcoming withdrawal to be consistent with a 4 month habit, essentially throwing out any positive effects from the recent detox/clean time?
Or will the upcoming withdrawal be milder due to having just been clean to the point of getting past all physical withdrawal symptoms?


I basically want to know if should cancel my plans this week and allocate time to withdrawing in bed, or if it won't be so bad this time around because of the recent detox/clean time.

Thanks ladies and gents. Any insight, experiences, etc. would be appreciated.

I think the first time I used was in the summer after 10th grade before 11th. I'm a senior in University now. My buddy and I were hanging out basically non stop at this point, and dude had some issues. Basically since he was a kid he said he wanted to do dope... So I knew a guy who knew a guy, and after a while guy who knew a guy came through. We started off snorting. 


Basically my friend ended up always copping for us. I never bothered actually calling the dealers even though I could have. We didn't use *that* much early on, just intermittently. Friend started shooting before the summer was out. I refused the first two or three times, but since he didn't die I eventually got over my squeamishness. He shot me up for the longest time, but I eventually started doing it for myself. Took me a while. I never did like letting someone else get me, but he insisted. He was much better and I couldn't always hit early on so it worked, and I trusted him.  


I'm not gonna write my whole lifes story here, but suffice it to say I once gave him CPR after OD'ing on me, he survived. He stole from me, came into my house and stole my stash, ""borrowed"" a lot of money, became a piece of shit. I cut him off. His whole life was fucked. In and out of rehab a few times. Me? I got sort of close to addiction a few times, but in all the years I've been using, I still haven't reached that point. Too much school work, too much work work, too much home work. I cannot let my family down, etc. 


It's been almost a year since I last used heroin, iirc. It's not out of frustration with life. I basically did it because I was getting daily cravings, and to be honest, I felt / feel like I can handle it since I have been handling it for 5 years now without incident. Nobody in my family even knows I have used, afaik. They probably have their suspicions but apparently people look up to me and shit in my family. If only they knew... I copped after all this time. 


I went to wallmart to get some sticks. I knew I wanted a relatively small guage so I just went for 30. Asked for ""30g 1/2"" 10ml"". I could have sworn 10ml were the full sized barrel ones. She said they didn't even make 30g 1/2"", which I'm almost certain is total bullshit. So I asked for some with a similar guage, she gave me 30g shorts instead. 5/16th or whatever. I was worried at first but they actually aren't too bad. I missed a few times because it's been a while but I found it easier to hit my forearm than the big fucking extruding vein in the crux of my elbow. weird. But now it's relatively hot out and I have fucking marks all up where I missed on the crux of my arms. Lol. 

I don't know. All I can really say is I'm glad I got the sticks. I plugged last night and fuck that. I'm going to have to not use tomorrow, or the next day, due to homework. Honestly? I'm not really confident in myself this time. I can't allow myself to get addicted, and I won't, I refuse to (everyone said ever :\), but it's shaping up to be problematic in terms of getting actual work done instead of staying up all night high as fuck. Like I am right now.

~~I'm gonna go ahead and skip most the dramatic bullshit and just get right to the good stuff.~~
I was traveling down the boulevard near 40 mph after leaving my dealers place- cuz OBVIOUSLY I couldn't get home fast enough- when my brain suddenly told me, ""naw fuck that, feed me drugs NOW mother fucker""

So as I'm about to pass a rite-aid, I make a last second decision to swing into the parking lot without looking ahead into the rite-aid parking lot to see if anyone was exiting. i hardly hit the brakes. As I swung into the rite-aid, I barely noticed a car that was exiting the parking lot at the same time as I was entering. It was a fucking cop. I came so very close to ramming right into him head-on.

I came to a complete stop just feet away from his front end and...

**PRO-TIP:** IMMEDIATELY reached for the bag of blow, and the few balloons of tar that are ALWAYS kept in my center console (yes, out in the open in plain sight) but always within arms reach and very easily accessible. I took a swig of a bottle of water that is also always opened and in my cup holder. 
The pro-tip point being here that, unless you're transporting serious weight, you should ALWAYS have your drugs OUTSIDE of your pocket, your sock, glove-box, under your seat, your shoe or whatever spot you thought was just so clever that a trained police officer would never be able to find it. Top lel.

Some stories I hear of people getting busted and catching felonies over possession of small personal amounts of dope are just unbelievable.

I will never understand how so many people think that their sock or jammed in between their seat is like an ideal hiding spot for your dope. DONT EVER KEEP IT ON YOUR PERSON LIKE THAT!

Anyways, I parked my car in the closest parking space that was near the front of the store and kept a close eye on the cop who had actually turned around, instead of exiting the parking lot, and was approaching me from behind. 
There was not a doubt in my mind that he was at the very least interested in me. Probably was trying to racial profile me, but I'm a very healthy and clean cut looking type of junkie. I had a mouth full of water and all the drugs in one hand, ready to be swallowed within .25 seconds had he lit me up....

But, for whatever reason, he just passed right on behind me and exited the rite-aid parking lot on the other end.
I could not believe it. I was able to save my dope and all.

So now onto some of the more interesting things i guess.

I've been on a gnarly tar/coke/xanax binge lately, and god damn... it really is something else...

First I swing by my coke dealer's place less than 3 miles away. 

$20 gets me .3 of high quality, rocky, snow white blow. I rack up a line before I even hit the road again... but wait! 
A Marlboro 27 is absolutely necessary at this point.

Roll the windows down, crank up the radio and then....

Ahhhhh, that warm, fuzzy, euphoria begins to set in.

Suddenly, the $500 I have spent this past week on drugs is all well worth it.

I then reach into my pocket and pull out an assortment of benzos. I usually go with a bar and 2 10mg valium. The timing here is crucial. I'll be back home within 10 minutes where my BTH awaits. I aim to take the first few hits of tar at the same time as the benzos kick in. If my timing is close enough, I can almost immediately go into a blissful nod for hours. 

*I'm on cloud 9.* **I'm on fucking cloud 9 and I'm never coming back down.**

EDIT:

1) We've all seen plenty of pix of tar and roxies, so i wanted to add this picture of the coke rock I got:

Any tips?,"I've been using Tianeptine at 'nootropic' doses (ie. 12.5mg sodium x3 per day or 40gm sulfate once per day) for about 8 months and I find it to be an excellent antidepressant and mood enhancer. Its now a mainstay in my stack. I love the  feeling after the first dose where all stresses and problems melt away and you are left to focus on the present moment/tasks at hand with a new optimism. In other words, it helps to remind me of the things that are going well with my life and instead of ruminating on things that need improvement\or aren't going well, actually formulate steps to improve on these.

It has also has been great in snapping me out of seasonal affective disorder which I inevitably sink into every winter.

I appreciate its nootropic\antidepressant effects, however; I am interested in exploring its recreational aspects. I've read that recreational doses of Tianeptine sodium range from 80mg-200mg. I've weighed up two capsules of the sodium: one with 80mg and the other with 120mg [pics](http://i.imgur.com/hpM7hg8.jpg). (I added a small amount of ashwagandha power to the larger dose to differentiate it. )

**Questions:**

* I don't really know what to expect from dosages at these levels. I've read varying reports saying that it feels like a mild MDMA roll and other that say it's comparable to hydrocodone. Would be interested in reading others' experiences to know what I should expect.
* Some say that Tianeptine sodium's potency is degraded when it absorbs moisture and clumps up. (My Tianeptine sodium has clumped up due to its hydroscopic [nature](http://i.imgur.com/GHoLsd1.jpg) )  Do you think that 120mg of clumpy Tianeptine will create recreational effects? or should I pop the other 80mg pill at the same time.
* Should I expect any unpleasant comedown, w\d effects afterwards? 
* I also have a jar of Tianeptine sulfate (which produces similar nootrotpic\mood boosting effects as the Tianeptine sodium) does anyone have any experience with Tianeptine sulfate at recreational dodges?

In order to further explore this drug I definitely want to try it at a higher 'recreational' doses. I don't plan to eat large amounts of it every day since I feel I would loose the nootripic benefits.

Just want to get the community's input on the recreational aspect of this substance. Any tips\advice and insight would be welcomed.

For reference: Ill partake in opiates (codine pharms) or benzos about once every month so my tolerance is minimal\baseline.

But I'm unsure if I Should lower this dose because of the adderall. Ive mixed 15mg of instant release adderall with 20mg done before and it was a good experience. What do you guys think? Also, should I take the adderall as is or should I crush up the beads and turn it into ir? I'm not trying to get high on the adderall but just want energy and alertness for once as I suffer from sarcoidosis and have chronic fatigue. Any input Is appreciated. 
Also how should I dose? Should I take the addy first and then the done or vise versa? Both at once? Whatta you think?",1442632142.0

Anyway I've been on 90mg methadone maintenance for over 6 months now. Due to the clinic dicking me around regarding the groups, it took me longer than it should have for me to qualify for take homes. Well I finally did, and it's great lol.

Just wondering though... I've always been thinking about how when I get a take-home I'd wanna like 'double dose' to get higher/feel better than just taking them separately. I'm broke and don't got money for benzos or weed so I can't just mix those with a single 'done dosage and be fine lol. So my question is, who here has experience with double dosing? At what dosages? Any tips/tricks for this? Any input is appreciated. Btw I have people always nearby, and narcan in the house, so as far as safety goes, I'm all covered, so you can skip mentioning about that. I'd post this to the methadone sub, but its so dead in there, and they're such fucking squares lmao, even mentioning doing benzos or anything else gets you this dumb ass copy/pasted 'warning' and its mad ironic how the subreddit 'owner/moderator' (the main one) acts like they're not about complete and total abstinence and that its fine to do other stuff every now and then... but in reality you can't actually talk about it, nor can you expect to have any meaningful discussion regarding those topics over there, so I figured here would be good. 

Anyway I appreciate all who read this, and all who will give intelligent input regarding this subject, PREFERABLY from people who are on or were on MMT and have experience with double dosing themselves, or from a close friend or something. I know there might be various 'methods' to do this, and if so, anyone know what they might be? 

BTW I've googled and done research elsewhere, but I still like to have the input of the people here since I really love this community and value the input of those here (who aren't trolling obv lol). Thanks again guys. Be safe, and happy nods everyone! ",1442616857.0

Life has certainly  changed for me over the last month and a half.  I've been diagnosed with manic depressive  bi polar, depression, chronic pain, and of course opiate dependence.  I have to say though, the quality of my life has gone up quite  a bit.  I'm level headed and have made much better choices, and I feel as if my head is on straight.  The suboxone has been a large part of this.  I take the same dose every day and my pain is manageable  most days and the days it's not all I really have to do is sit down prop my leg up  and relax a bit and usually the reason the pain is unmanageable  in the first place is because I push myself to hard.  I'm rather impressed that I haven't felt like I need a higher dose.  I made a post a few weeks back about how to ask my doctor for a higher dose but I honestly think that feeling came from me wanting to try catching a buzz.  But now that the bipolar and mood stabilizing meds have been in my body for almost 2 months I don't feel like I need anymore.  Honestly, with this regimen I might be out of the heroin game for good.  I'm  quite happy with life, managed to get a part time job as a barrista for a small local coffee shop.  It's rather light work with downtime.  My mom's boyfriend has been teaching me about computers and basic IT work and I'm thinking about going back to school to get back into the computer world.  Hopefully I can stay straight and get my shit together so to speak.

Only quibble is the amount of subtitles that are right at the bottom of the screen and takes away from the action . But it's a great series and can't wait for season 2 . I had no idea how much Pablo Escobar had the government in his pocket and totally terrified of him ! Some of the stuff is completely unbelievable if it didn't actually happen ! IE SPOILER ! When he turns himself in after he builds his own lavish jail ! .?? Lolz WTF !!  
  Anyways I had to cold cop on Friday and the stuff was pretty shit but a good £10 bag was defenetly over 0.2 g a nice sized lil rock and some powder though it was quite yellow in appearance took it in town in a disabled Tesco toilet as I couldn't wait . It got me well ....barely and started going into WD about 12am that night 😐brought I managed to get a few hours sleep . 
  So I had been up all night and decided to phone my gran at about 9am unfortunately I woke her up so she told me she'd phone back as she couldn't think of any jobs I could do . She phoned back in 20 minutes wanting me to paint the hut that she recently purchased and said my grandpa would come and get me . But I said I was happy to bike it to her house (3/4 miles) as I could do with the exercise . Also I could hardly get my grandpa to stop off at my dealers on the way home ! So got there in about 25 minutes and I think she was determined to pick me up ! As she said she phoned back after I hung up to say they would come and get me . As she worries a lot and thought the bike ride to her house would be to dangerous as I don't have a helmet and it's quite a bad road, loads of ppl have died on it 😔 including a couple of friends/neighbours  But I quickly got changed and was out the door sharpish so missed her call . 
  When I was at my dealers I was wanting 3/4 of a gram for £30 but he didn't have any tenner bags made up and had bought a half Oz of rolling tobacco as I was out and had run out at about 3am the night before so I couldn't even chain smoke ! Like I normally do in WD for some reason . Though it's maybe a good thing as I still have £15 left and can scrape up a fiver for a half G on Tuesday if I can make this one last two days . 
  I'm feeling pretty good now 😊 and hope every one is doing good and hope everyone is having a chilled Sunday ! It's honestly my least favourite day as a lot of things are closed and the place is like a ghost town 😐 not good if your trying to make some money ! So happy nods peeps ! ",1442751527.0

i used to do other things though. i used to write. i lost all that somewhere in the midst of my addiction. im so rusty i doubt id be able to do it again. 

sometimes i think, if only i had a good amount of friends to hang out with, money to blow, and good transportation, my addiction wouldnt even be an issue. but i dont have those things and im not exactly a teenager where i can expect my social circle to change drastically any time soon. ive always been a lone wolf anyway.

3lnblr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3lnblr/i_had_no_idea/,20,https://redd.it/3lnblr,superultimatejesus,I had no idea,"I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I couldn't position the cord properly on my bicep, I couldn't tie it correctly, I couldn't feel around the crook of my arm and find a vein. Shit, this is so much work, how do daily IV users do it?  
Let's go back a bit. I've always snorted heroin. I've shot before, but always had someone else do the deed. On one particular night, a longtime friend with whom there exists a notable sexual tension (this isn't bragging, it's crucial to the story) and I ventured to the south side and copped. She picked up a few points while we were there. She prefers to shoot. So it goes.  
We get back to my place and as I look for a surface to snort from, a card, and a straw or receipt, I turn my head back and she's already heating the spoon. Here I am scrambling for simple pre-industrial tools, and she's already mastered twentieth century technology. You can guess who the professional is here.  
I sit positioned behind her, holding her arm up and helping her tie stay tight. She pokes in the syringe and registers on the first hit. The fluid goes into her arm effortlessly. I apply an alcohol swab and undo the tie as she leans back towards me in euphoria. I get up, and sit across from her, face to face. Her eyes have noticeably softened and a effortless half-crook of a smile adorns her thin lips.  
I think I'm in love. I think I'm fucked up.  
I ask her, in an awkward tone, if she can use the other needle on me. She opens her mouth to.speak, her eyes narrow slightly, but just as swiftly widen to those soft doe eyes I know and love. Her mouth closes into a wide smile. 
""Sure. If you want to.""
I wasnt sure I did. But after we cooked up and tied my arm off, as I sat across from her in mere inches, I knew I was sure. She held my arm as I pumped my fist, rested lightly on her thigh. She felt around for a vein and found one. The professional fader she is, she registered on first attempt. The plunger went down, then up a bit, then down, several times in a rollercoaster of euphoria that only climbs and never falls.  
She pulled the needle out and swabbed the injection site. It hits me. Warmth, that familiar place you all know that reminds you of an orgasm but in a completely paradoxically different way. My stance lowers. My eyelids fall, and my eyes fall in turn, into hers, holding that crushing gaze for what felt like several eternities. I was flattened, right then and there. This is the opposite of a fairytale love story.  
Fast forward several nights, and I came home after copping a half. I planned on just snorting it, but as I sat down to open the wrap, I turned my head and saw an insulin syringe on my end-table, still inIits packaging. If fate exists, this was its tendrils moving my feet on the oath of my own destiny.  
I tried for ten minutes to get the tie in correctly. In one hand, a vessel full of a light brown honey of the gods, and In the other hand, a fucking phone charger which mocks my sudden inability to tie a knot. 
It's tied. I pump my arm, and feel around on my arm for a good vein, trying to remember how she did it. I locate the vein, and rather clumsily insert the needle. I let it rest and tried to pull back on the plunger, which was surprisingly difficult to achieve with only one available hand. I manage to pull back. Nothing. I pull the needle out, tighten the knot, and pump my hand a bit more. A bulge sticks out, right near where she hit me a few days earlier. I insert the needle an inch away from that now sacred site. I pull back. Nothing. Minutes pass, but I'm too determined by now to consider quitting. I move the needle one last time..and blood pours in. I pull back. A beautiful cascade of rosy liquid coalesces with the salt-lake sunset awaiting in the needle. I push down. I pull up, more blood comes in, I in turn push the rest in. Undo the tie. Swab my arm. Soften my eyes, release an uncontrollable smile.  
  
And that was it. I taught myself what may perhaps be one of the most dangerous  pieces of knowledge known to man. That was a year ago. I don't snort anymore. My love, my beautiful disaster, was taken by the rise of fentanyl cut in the spring. I still reach for the needle regardless.  
I'm still not sure who exactly I fell in love with on that fateful day.",1442727297.0

Other days, I can't even get up off the couch. 

Elective surgery is not as widely recommended for hernia these days (I'm also terrified of surgery) so I've been contemplating talking to my doctor about the pain. However, I've been to detoxes and outpatient programs for opiate abuse, so I don't think any docs would prescribe me any opiate painkillers after reviewing my medical records (not to mention, my tolerance to pharms would be extremely high at this point).

So yeah, what illness/injury do all you guys with meds have that requires such aggressive treatment? Anyone else have a hernia? Anyone else suffer from pain, yet have substance abuse on their medical records? If so, how have you handled that?

I don't know why he tried using again. Well, I don 't know the specific reasons. I know why we do it. We think ""just one more"" or life becomes to painful or we are depressed. We might even be celebrating. Who the fuck knows. 

I quit heroin 17 years ago. I did that. In that 17 years, I have been prescribed opiates 5 times. The longest was for 2 weeks after an emergency c-section. I remember enjoying that feeling, the familiar cloud. I had to taper off with a newborn. My legs were twitching while she screaming in my ears. The agony and the not quite joy but certainly the lack of pain. That was 8 years ago. My body fell into that place again, the vulnerable place. It was but I rolled with it. Every time you kick, it is always hard. Even if it is a medical necessity. 

What was my friend thinking? Maybe he wasn't thinking at all. Maybe picking up was a natural as tying his shoes. I can never ask him

Today is day 5 (I think) since I last used.  Here is what I experienced as far as physiological effects/withdrawals/cravings so far:

-Blood Pressure increase for several days (Hypertensive levels)

-Mild constipation on day 2

-Slight insomnia trying to sleep on night 2 (I did get 4 hours though).
-No Restless Leg Syndrome.

-I noticed I wasn't very happy at work on either day 2 or 3 (Which is odd considering I kinda have a lot of fun at work... Usually).

-No real cravings all week.  Although, I am pretty bored right now... Typing this is actually the biggest trigger I've had all week.
I think it's a false sense of freedom from hard withdrawals.

-Considering copping a 20 sac right now (See bullet point above for dumbass reasoning), but not sure if I've waited long enough.

-Still feel itchy as fuck for some reason, even before I relapsed, I don't understand it at all, it's exactly the same itch you get from dope except it doesn't feel good to scratch - It's just annoying.  Sometimes I itch till I bleed.  I hope this isn't permanent, or just some allergy that I'm not aware of.


Side Notes:

-Did not get fired, lose friends, or loved ones.

-No close call with an overdose.

-My main cast I'm usually around knew that I was noticeably ""Off"" and highly suspected my relapse on the day I used, but it felt as though I was being super stealth about it (Eye drops, trying not to mumble, trying not to nod off, etc..).  They were about 51% sure, but they ended up giving me the benefit of the doubt.


Conclusion: I really love being able to sleep, poop, and enjoy things other than dope.  But I almost equally love dope.  I don't entirely regret my relapse, yet..

It is like the dope version of Sal in pinapple express.,"So everyone has dealt with that type of dealer who strings you along and plays the hurry up and wait game. Let's share our stories about those times where your dealer feels like Sal from pinapple express.

Here is my story from last night..

I live in the 208 which does not have an open market and higher prices since everything gets ran up from a neighboring state's hub city which is about 5 hours each way. So anyways it is hard to find a good d boy in my capital city. 

I met this guy a couple weeks ago after I started buying ounces of ganja from him. At this time I had a guy already but the prices were higher and he was a MM so it was difficult to score because of his work schedule and his d girls schedule.

So one night I wanted to score but normal guy was not happening. So I was at the ganja man's house and was really wanting some dope so I took a shot in the dark and asked him ""what else do you fuck with?"" And out of nowhere he went unexpected thug life on me and busted out; meth, tar, acid, shrooms, & roxy. So I was like fuck yeah and bought a couple bags from him. Went home and it got me pretty lit so I started going through him since he had it on hand instead of MM.

So the first couple deals went alright, in and out in 15 or 20 mins. Yesterday I waited all day for him to get off work so I could come through, which is usually 5pm. Apparently he had busier than normal day and I try not to be pushy with him. Waited till 7pm before I get kinda anxious and decide to give him a call, he answered and says he literally just walked in the door to his house and to give him 1 hour. So I'm like cool I can handle that.

So I am sitting and waiting, browsing /r/opiates and playing games on the phone trying to pass the time. An hour goes by and I'm thinking ""cool he should be calling me soon like he said"". I continue trying to pass the time, smoke on my ganja and looking at the clock every 5 minutes. Another hour passes and I'm getting anxious again, it after 9pm at this point. I really hate to push him, but again decide to call him for an update, figured 2 hours was enough time for him to unwind from work.

So he doesn't answer my call which makes me a little uneasy, but he calls back like 5 minutes later and tells me he had to make a run and will home in ten minutes. I tell him that It takes me atleast 20 mins to drive to his area and ask if I can start driving since he said only ten minutes, but he tells me no and he will call me back soon when he is almost to his house. So I'm like cool I will wait, 10 minutes is not bad.

Boy was I wrong. Close to an hour goes by and still no call from him. At this point it is 10pm and again I hesitantly called him to see if he is home thinking maybe he forgot about me. He answered and sounded just very slightly annoyed, but tells me I can roll through. So I feel relieved and start driving to his spot.

Finally show up to the trailer park and pull up to his spot to see his truck isn't even there. So I call to see where he is and he says he is right around the corner getting smokes. So I am pretty sketched out sitting in my car in a dark ass trailer park in the most ghetto part of my city. It is now close to 11pm. He finally gets home after 10 or 15 minutes and we go inside, with my mind thinking ""ok this won't take long"", wrong again.

So after going inside I can tell he is pretty gacked out on meth. He is talking non stop and is in the kitchen putting dishes away and other random shit while talking like we have known eachother for a life time. After an agonizing 25 minutes or so he finally busted out and we do the exchange. So I start to get ready to mob out and he tells me that I ""CAN NOT LEAVE"" until I smoke some of his ganja because it was new stuff and better than the previous product. So I think ""FUUUCKK... ok not a big deal, I will get stoned for free and then go..""

So I sit there for like another 20 minutes or so while he sits there and just rolls joint after joint while talking to me the entire time. Meanwhile he has no foil so I can't even take a hit while I'm sitting there. He wanted to smoke some of his tar with me so he puts some inside a joint which I thought was fucking wasteful but I don't say anything of course. Finally he hands me the joint and we smoke it for a good 10 minutes and I started to gather my stuff so I can GTFO of there, it's past 11:30pm. 

My hand was inches away from opening the front door when he suddenly stops me and tells me he really needs to go somewhere but can't take his truck to where he is going and asks for a ride while trying to hand me $10. Since he is the best connect I know at the time I accept the $10 and agree to drive him, even though on the inside I was screaming.

He makes a call saying to someone that he is on his way (lmfao)..
 I sit back down on the couch while he went into the back room to weigh out God knows what. Takes him 15 minutes and he walks out and goes in the kitchen and starts microwaving some noodles and then sits down and starts eating. At this point I am nearly having a panic attack wanting to go home but having to wait for him while he is slurping on some noodles and talking to me for like 2 minutes in between bites. 

Now it is after midnight and he is done eating and we walk outside and start to get in the car, until he says he forgot something and goes back inside. So again I am just sitting in my car in this dark trailer park for what seemed like an hour but was probably 5 minutes. So gets in and we take off. At this point I can really tell he is extremely tweaked out, talking really loud non stop, and there were a couple things he said that were literally non sense and I had no idea what he was actually trying to say. 

Then he asks to stop at a gas station so he can get a arizona tea. He walks around doing like 3 laps around the store before he finally pays for his tea and comes back to the car. So I start taking him to drop him off where he needs to go, talking to me the entire time with only half of it coming out right making sense.

I have some people who are familiar with my regular account, so I've always avoided posting here to keep my deniability in tact. Not very bropiate of me, I know, but I would prefer keeping the knowledge of my habits on the low. 

The nutshell version is I've been hooked for about 6 years now, pills only, and mostly oxy, though I've done months at a time of dilly, morph, hydro, fent; depends on who the main supply at the time is. Never wanted to get involved with dope, though I do IV as of the past 2 years. The point is, with pharms I know exactly what I am getting and know exactly what I can handle, which is a lot, and I've never had any sort of scare whatsoever. Even with fent. Until today. (The exposition is complete, sorry for the long story).

I've been doing fent for two weeks. 50mc Mylans. Been ruining my veins cause I'm an idiot. I've been cooking the whole patch, just not very long, and have been getting about 4 shots before its done and go the bucal route. Today I got interrupted halfway through the process, and ended up leaving the patch in the spoon for an hour or so. I knew that would make for a solid shot when I got back to it, but wasn't really worried. Well, I finished the prep, took a painful shot because I used vinegar, and grabbed my glass of water to clean the rig. Woke up 30 minutes later, facedown on my bed, holding a rig half full of water, and completely soaked, as I had let go of my glass while I went out and it was now empty. I was immediately nauseous and ran to the bathroom but managed to not puke. I have never fallen out before, so I have no idea how close I came to an OD, or if that actually was one, but I can't tell you how scary the feeling was. There was no one in the house to help me. If I had fallen backwards instead of forwards, would I have woken up in time before I puked in my sleep and choked? I have no idea how close I just came to having it end, I'm no expert on ODs, but I definitely have a lot of considering to do, and I think this might have been the thing to set me straight. I hope so at least. 

PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM FENTANYL. I have been the safest user I know for 6 years now. Never even considered an OD as I know my exact doses and tolerance. And yet I almost just lost it all. It is that easy guys. Thanks for reading.

This time, my questions has been answered to an extent but I was hoping for more specific information.

There was nothing available so I took a few methadons from my back up stash (50mg) with the intent of catching my usual buzz (which I later achieved). Of course, right after I took the 'done, my guy got ahold of me with good news. Now, about 7 hours after taking the done, it is starting to wear off and I am wondering a few things;

For safety reasons, should I be waiting until the 'done is gone entirely before either adding to it or re-dosing? Or perhaps even the next day with the 1/2 life being so long?

I was under the impression that it does not perform as a blocker until about 60-70mg, would you agree or disagree in general?

Can I take some oxy to build on top of the remaining 'done buzz or don't they work the same? 

If I can build on it, should I start with perhaps 1/2 my normal dose? Normal dose is about 30mg of oxy, via my nose if that matters.

I know one is an opiate and one is an opioid but on the same receptors and I know everyone's body is very different and it will be hard to give specific information. However, if you could perhaps provide me with any personal experience or anything you know about the subject? Any and all info is greatly appreciated.

Well anyway this kid from the get go was the type of kid (for one he's a middle man with no job or cell phone) that you can't trust farther than you can throw him...if you don't have arms.

Well anyway my question is how many chances can you give a dope hear before you are forced to ""discipline"" them via ass beating, leaving them in the hood with no ride, trash them on Reddit or another form of teaching them a lesson?

Do you think it depends on the offense or the amount of times they do something that counts as a strike in your life?

Here's what he did to me.....

1. I pretty sure he pinched out of my bags, but can't be proven...My other buddy he has middle before said that he picked up from him and jumped from one car to another but the bags just appear to be small.  So I gave that one a ""push"".  But I think he pinched my bags...

2.  I gave him 50 bucks because he had done something to  lead me to believe we were ""cool"" and I was considered an actual friend that he wouldn't try and pull any shit..WRONG!  I get a text. Bro the girl who drove me grabbed all but one of those bags!  The girl was an innocent non junkie and I highly doubt this kid would let heroin out of his site. So I'm super pissed off of course cause that was my last cash for a bit.  He said ""oh things like this make me cut myself"" I didn't fall for that story...So I had to drive to his house 3 separate times to get 3 bags total of my 50!  That was DEF strike 1 and I almost just said fuck it and beat his ass.  I couldn't prove he hustled me, but I wasn't planning on anymore BS...But alas I'm too nice.

3.  I asked him if he has subs to sell. he said I'm low but yes...So I go to his house and put the cash in a shirt pocket. he supposed to take shirt and get his cash and toss in the subs for me. I get home and 3 subs are 2!  I call him bitching and his answer was ""well I told you I was running low!""  You dumb fuck than don't sell 3 to me...You still charged me! Then I straight up told him..Dude next time I'm gonna just beat your ass no mercy! And he said ok.

4....I see him post a FB saying his mom has some sealed bottles of really expensive lotion that retailed 2 bottle for about 300 bucks...I offered him 40 and he jumped all over it.  Brings them over and my GF buys them.  They looked sealed and when she opened them I knew he had hustled...The lotion inside was fucking Lubriderm! I know the smell and texture. The slimy fuck has shrink wrap an sealed the shit up..He would of gotten away with it too if it was someone more trusting..After that he checked into rehab the next day before I was able to confront him and ask.  I thought about just asking his mother about it.

So what do you think?  I'm a dumbass for being nice and not a Pablo Escobar no mercy type guy..I just shocked someone so grimy for 10 bucks man! lol  

This kid blew to opportunities to get in close with two dudes with cars and cash flow who would be willing to help out when he's hurting, give him rides and not tax the shit out of him and just plain old friendship!

It more important ot burn someone for 5 bags than to get 2 indefinitely every time you are taken to go score...Middlemen are a strange group of people...

But I've always loved taking opiates since like 9th grade, 2009, and I'm 20 now. But I want to stop and I want the urge to use to go away. I want to be normal again and not want opiates. But as you all know it's hard af. Luckily I don't get too bad withdrawls, I just get very tired, depressed, and lethargic. Sometimes I get the runs and if I've gotten high enough the night before, I may throw up. But no horrible pains or horrible colds and sweats., but minor. All my symptoms have been minor. But I'm starting intensive outpatient care on Monday, so I hope they can help and give me meds to help with cravings anxiety and depression. I'm just ready to be my old self again, and I don't know how. My parents found out and that's why I'm in treatment, but I really know I need it and am trying to get my mind to agree, it's just my brain likes to convince me otherwise and say no it's fine to use a little and I've fallen back to it a couple times since I've gotten in trouble with my parents. They went to Boston for 3 days and I used each day, and I've picked up twice since then. Shot all of the times except this last pickup. I'm trying to just smoke it but with how much I have left and the high I'm trying to get, I'll probably end up shooting it. Hopefully this will be the last time since I start treatment tomorrow and can find other ways to cope and have meds to help. I have kava kava and valerian root to help, but it slightly helps.

So I went to this chick I had been picking up from for years, got myself I think 4 dillies. Was gonna go home and snort em but decided to pull over and snort them on a street I've done it on a million times. Got through 2 when my girl calls me and asks when I'll be home, just then the piggies roll up. I tell my girl I'll call her back and start chatting with them. They're asking what I'm doing there, who's car it is, why I have laundry bags in my back seat. One cop reaches through my passenger window and unrolls the paper towel that has the dillies in it. Fuck! But I had a rolled up dollar sitting in the cup holder anyway so I was done for. They pull me out and search me, find my work knife. Knives are very illegal here in NYC and cops will find any reason to claim it's a gravity knife, which they did. I plead with the cops a bit trying to get them to just let me walk home, how I have a family etc. no dice. Take me to a holding cell where I sit for like 6 hours before getting let out with a court date for possession of the dillies and possession of a deadly weapon. Fucking pigs.

Enjoy it or do something else or whatever.)  
  
  
It was somewhere near noon. July in ohio can be beautifully unforgiving. I got a call from a friend, recently sober, who said she wanted to go swimming. I agreed without hesitation.  
We picked up another friend and headed for a local lake, stocked with beer and plastered-on smiles.You see, at this point, we've all been off the needle for about three weeks. It wasn't a mutual pact or anything, just coincidental timing that would forever change our lives.  
For all you would-be warriors out there, here's the worst part of withdrawal: the aftermath. After you get past the cold sweats and diarrhea, insomnia and irritability, you get the real treat. Depression, one unlike anything you've ever known. Doctors call it anhedonia. Look up that word on wikipedia; it's not at all.inaccurate to how you feel after the physical withdrawal wears off.  
I think that's why many addicts relapse. They all know withdrawal; they can feel the storm brewing, hear the rumbling thunders of discomfort in the distance. Then, just after they think the storm has passed, a hurricane hits. It doesn't feel like much. It doesn't feel like anything. If I were to describe it to you, had you never experienced it, you'd say it was all in my head.  
That's the thing. It is all in the head. And that's where the nastiest aspects of who you are as a person like to hang out.  
Back at the lake, a few beers and many laughs in, the subject of addiction comes up. This leaks into heroin, which cascades into what our old drug dealers are doing now that we're not dropping benjamins on them daily.  
The look between the three of us came so swiftly, that I'm not sure any of us realized it at first. The decision was nonverbal yet lucid. This would be the day that we stopped stopping. We've all run the cycle too many times now; why not just give in? Any self-justification you can think of, it was there, alive and ready to tell us that yes, we do deserve a little taste, if not a full lick. Life passes moment by moment, and then, one day, there are no more moments. Why not enjoy every single one to its fullest?  
All that bullshit.  
We get our money together. I look for mine -- pockets full of empty. Shit. They still have about $120 between them, guess I'll have to pay back my due the next time we see each other. Surprisingly, neither of them objected to this. This could be because we've all been really good friends for a long time, or because I'm the only one with a car and a license. Either way, doesn't matter. I get mine.  
We trek up from what amounts to us as backwoods wilderness into the south side of the inner city. Copped a half, drove to my place, got the gear ready. They fixed up first; I expected this, being basically a beggar.  
Then came my turn. He poked around my arm a bit, but finally registered. Out goes the blood, in goes the nectar. And just like that, the world was okay again. My shitty job was alright because, fuck it, why care? My fallen friends, all now resting eternally in wooden boxes, dead beneath about six feet of living earth, they were afterthoughts, sad as it is to say. I remembered them as they were, not where they are now.  
My directionless life? Fuck a compass.

No pills, no booze, no cigs, nothing. I've been in this life for almost 10 years now and I'm really getting sick of it. If you read my other post you know I ended up doing a hit and run yesterday, destroying my car in the process. I went back to the car I hit and left a note with my fathers phone number, they called him and they want $500 to fix the damage, so I guess that's not so bad, but I need to pay my father back for that, in addition to whatever it costs to fix my car. 

Days like today remind me of when I was back in college, doing sketchy shit in order to feed my habit, and picking butts up off the ground just to get a little nicotine buzz. My professor really wanted me to finish this story I was writing at the time about my experiences as a drug addict. He even wanted to help me get it published, can you believe that? I could've been a successful writer by now had I stuck with college and not dropped out for a shitty temporary job that only lasted 2 weeks. 

I really want to get sober, but I think I'd end up putting a bullet in my head. I don't remember how to be sober, what I did before drugs. I think my vices were music but even now all of my favorite songs just remind me of drugs I've taken. I can't even listen to modest mouse anymore without getting a craving, and I love modest mouse. What the fuck do I do? Treatment isn't an option because I'd lose my job and honestly I actually have a future at this company. Should I write that book? Should I just continue getting high and see where life takes me? Get sober and move up in my job? Save up and move across the country? Put a bullet in my head?

As of right now, that bullet sounds quite pleasant.",1442778478.0

Rush but don't crush.... Diladid has the tendency to feel like its pulling you down by your arm, and fent is so short acting that you don't get the sense of closeness, some even get anxiously, feeling the need to redose.

But dont! Tolerance is one thing at stake. butill tell you  what's worse ...a compensatory response (or psuedo tolerance) is your body adapting to complex environments. In this case, a familiar environment (my bathroom) paired with another common thing (your bag of dope, bag of roxys or Dillies...whatever it is cause I know it isn't fentynl, cause doing CW regularly is just wierd). Both those things paired together cause the response in your body that I just mentioned, a compensatory response. This is your body attempting to ""compensate"" for the effects of the drugs. Have you ever noticed how after you cop and before you get well you don't feel as sick? Essentially, your body can emulate the effects of the drugs thanks to a microscopic pharmacy in your brain called neurotransmitters. Why? The theory is that if the body can achieve a portion of the desired effects then the user could lessen overall intake of the drug (thereby subverting a bunch of side effects). 

But that's not reality, because an addicts attempt to rationalize creates this narrative, "" well I use alot all the time, man, so like I need way more than I used to."""" 

Ok, no sense in trying to change our mind, cause this mind's t will never change...
But still, what if something else changes?

Say for instance, your routine was followed right down to grabbing a cue-tip and your pulp fiction VHS, but then.... favorite spot to shoot up at get destroyed. So you've got to go shoot up in your neighbors bathroom (unexpectedly is key here xause your brain is super adaptive). 

When you do, you use the same (larger amount) that you had planned on taking in your old bathroom before it got destroyed.

You are statistically 50% more likely to die of an overdose. 70%/if another variable is changed (say for instance the heroin you bought was cut with fentynl w/o your knowing)
....know why?....

Because that compensatory response your body had relied on during your little escapade was turned off when you walked over to your neighbors house, and was not even alerted to the inbound substance change....

 Jason looks out the living room curtains.  His roommate is in a sleep deprived, cocaine induced psychosis.  Haven't actually seen him pass out for days.  Now he's standing in the street yelling at cars and pedestrians.  But at least he has his clothes on.  Well, he's not wearing a shirt or his boots but at least he put on pants and a jacket.

 ""The DARKNESS COMES!"" screams the madman pointing a Corona bottle at a Muni bus before he throws it at the sleazy Calvin Klein ad on the side.  

 ""Here I am motherfuckers!  You fucking SUBHUMAN PIECES OF SHIT!""

 As he bellows and raises his arms over his head in an aggressive, dominant male display like his primate ancestors, Jason spots the missing kitchen knife shoved into his waistband.  

 Oh boy.  With a heavy sigh, Jason pulls on his jacket and jogs down the stairs past the curious stares of the neighbors.  These are cool people.  The Mission District is a pretty forgiving place.  But when your shirtless, 6'2 roommate with a braided mohawk stands in the street throwing bottles and screaming...Well, words like forgiving take on a new meaning.  

 Best to get this over quickly.

 *~*~*~*~*~*~*

 They are all around me.  I can't always see them...but I can feel them when I reach out with my mind.  With my mind.  My...

 ""HEY!""

 The BEAST runs at him...oh shit.  

 ""Jason?""

 ""Hey dude.  Let's go inside ok?""

 ""I can't.  YOU locked me out.""

 ""No man.  YOU went out and locked the door behind you.  Old habits I guess.  Hey.  Can I hold the knife dude?  It would make me feel better.""

 I look at him.  He looks like a demented bunnyman.  A big fucking smile and mad bunnyman eyes.  I pull out the knife and stare at him a moment.  Then I hand it over.  Handle first for safety.

 ""Let's get out of here"" says Jason looking around.  ""We'll be lucky if no one called the cops.""

 *~*~*~*~*~*~*

 Kym has been gone for more than a week and it's like civilization is breaking down.  The place is trashed.  Broken glass, burnt carpet, shattered dishes and piles of garbage everywhere.  Plus his roommate has reverted into some sort of psychotic, primal version of himself.  He consumes any drug in front of him and drinks all day and night.  The place stinks of stale beer from all the empty and broken bottles.  The cocaine gives him energy to push past the bounds of sanity and launches him into full fucking asshole mode.  

 I stopped going out with him.  It always ends badly.  Puking on bars, getting thrown out, all the fighting, running from bouncers and cops and always throwing shit...  

 He's usually cool.  The guy that handles the bills and reminds you to lock the door at night.  So polite and thoughtful. Usually the most level headed and sane one of us all...

 SMASH!

 ""Hey!  What the fuck?!  Did you just throw a fucking bottle at me?!""

 And the bastard stands there smiling like a loon and shrugs.

 ""Missed the trash Jase.  Hey, you have any more coke?""

 ""You fucking stole more than a 8ball!  And you trashed my room doing it!""

 ""That was your room?"" he asks seriously.

 Jason ponders for a moment.  What if I just lay his ass out?  Just clock him?  Sometimes all a guy needs is a good ass kicking...But he looks so fucking helpless and then there is the whole friendship thing.  Jason sighs and searches his memory for anyone who has valium.  Maybe slip some in his beer...

 *~*~*~*~*~*~*

 And when Kym left holy shit.  Now that was a fight.  It sounded like they were throwing each other through the walls.  Just beating the living shit out of each other.  But when I looked it was all Kym.  She was swinging one of the kitchen chairs at him while he taunted her.  She smashed the table, the stove and the walls with the heavy wooden chair as he laughed and dodged out of the way.  

 ""You're such an asshole!  I fucking HATE you!"" she screamed while waving the chair in the air.

 ""Fine!  You fucking hate me so much then LEAVE!""  

 ""You'd like that so you can go fuck that stupid slut!""

 ""What?!  What are you talking about?  You're crazy Kym!  Fucking crazy!""

 ""Don't call me CRAZY!"" she screamed as she launched herself across the room at him.

 ""Crazy!  Crazy!  CRAZY bitch!""

 And with an unearthly scream - she threw the chair at him.  

 Kym's a big girl and can punch like a man.  Jason knows this from getting sucker punched by her at a party.  You have to keep an eye on her when she gets loaded.  So when Kym took a running start and threw the chair, she threw it hard.  Caught off guard, the chair floored him.  Knocked his ass backwards across the kitchen and straight into the open dishwasher.  Plates, bowls and glasses smashed from all the spikes on his leather jacket.  But he popped up quick.  Had a bad look in his eye.  For a second I thought I have to get between these two coked out beasts...but he just glared at her, turned and stomped out the door.  

 She packed her shit and left.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

 Melo helped him up the stairs after he kicked his ass.  Now he's passed out on the ground.  His face is all lumpy.  Melo said he deserved it and I concur.  Fucker trashed my room again.  I have to keep the coke on me until this situation changes.  

 Not good.

 *~*~*~*~*~*~*

 I wake up sore.  Every muscle feels either trampled, crushed or yanked apart.  OD again?  Beaten?  My body is drugged, limp and shattered.  Groaning I roll over.  My thoughts are carried by ants that slowly creep back into my ears.  They return home carrying my shame.  Black crumbs of misery.  But the last ant sneaks in holding a glowing shard of pure starlight.  Hope.  And I feel ok for a moment.  But then the world heaves up, collapses and crushes me.  The ant smuggling starlight hides inside my heart.  

 I shudder thinking of her screams.  Like vines twisting towards me across the cables and wires.  So very distant and sad.  Love ripped apart by two drug crazed animals and scattered across frozen landscapes like bones.  Blurry memories of fucked up shit I pray is untrue...And then the Mercy.  I pass out again.  

 I wake up on some random fucking day.  

 Daylight filtering through the curtains whispers of a life beyond the windows.  My life neglected.  School, job and friends just slipping away in the passage of time.  And a normal day awaits me.  Normal people doing normal things.  They wake up healthy, go to school or work.  Maybe have a beer at the end of the day with friends.  And they speak of normal things.  No one says anything about the bruises and weeping wounds in the crook of my arms.  They do not ask why my right hand is bigger than the left one...  

Jesus.  New holes in my arms and hand.  A machine gun pattern of lost days.  Abuse and shards of memories.  Bad ones.  More fucking holes.  

So I add AIDs and Hepatitis to my ever growing list of Fears. 

 Far away across the dream, my heart hurts.  The rhythm is off.  Like a jazz drum beat.  When it scatters madly in my chest I know I'm dying.  I have been injecting too much cocaine...Cocaine and heroin.  Speedballs.  That girl with the stupid hat taught me that one.  Autumn?  Our secret.  No Kym.  No Jason.  Just me, Autumn and a new way to get higher than high.   

As I remember her explaining why Jason's coke is good because it actually dissolves, I cringe.  Betrayal?  We weren't fucking but it felt like we were fucking people over.  And I helped her shoot it in her neck...the intensity in her eyes as she watched the mirror.  Her lifeblood filled the rig in two pulsing heartbeats and squirted out the side.    

""Ok.  Don't tell Jase - 'babe'!"" she teased me a moment before she made a snorting noise and her eyes rolled back into her skull.

 Jesus.  Injecting coke.  And screaming and laughing while we did it over and over again.  And heroin?  Or was it morphine?  The rush was so sudden and intense...Autumn has to hold me up as I convulsed.  I think she slapped me when I kept blacking out.   

 My ghost is trying to rip free from my body.  I don't blame him.  

 Fuck.  I miss Kym.  Like a blackhole in my Universe sucking my soul through the starlight of her eyes.  My anchor.  Her love kept me here.  Now I'm gone.    

 No dreams.  Nothing but Darkness.  

 And the Darkness comes.

 *~*~*~*~*~*~*

 Fucker has slept in the hall for two solid days.  Today I dragged him out of the bathroom so I wouldn't have to piss over his head.  While I pulled him down the hall he laughed like a madman.  Then he passed out again.  I keep him on his side.

 Fuck him.  Should I stash all my shit at Autumn's place and call an ambulance?  Not sure I trust that chick 100% with my stash.  Shit not even 50%.  

 I don't think he needs an ambulance.  I mean he wakes up long enough to puke and pee.  Usually in the toilet.  Maybe I'll make him some toast.


*~*~*~*~*~*~*

 KNOCK KNOCK.

 I look around.  I seemed to have wormed my way back to the living room.  There is a bottle of water near my face and a plate of toast that has a couple bites in it.  The sun has set somewhere.  Night is returning but something has yanked me back to the Real.  

 I look around confused.  KNOCK KNOCK.

The haze of lost days feels like stones piled over my body.  I push them aside groaning.  I was raised by people who answer doors and telephones.  I grab the door handle and pull myself up.  As I open the door, my heart sighs.  The rhythm is steady and grows stronger.  Life begins anew.

 Behind her, the sun has sunk burning into the sea.  It paints Kym in the twilight patterns of dusk.  A saffron colored floral print sundress hangs off her frame.  She stands motionless in four inch platform heels and her dress ripples in the gentle bay breeze.  A portrait of fashion and beauty with her usual twisted twists.  A spiked dog collar and she shaved her head except for her bangs which sprout pink and orange over the blue eyes that devour me.  Our souls meet in her stare, she studies me for an instant and smiles.  She knows I am still her creature.  She slips into my arms without a word and in that moment, I know love for one thousand years.

 But I am weakly human.  Jealous and petty.  Carrion bird thoughts flutter through my mind.  Should I ask her if she is out of oxycodone?  Or heroin?  Are you strung out Kym?  Did you miss me?  Or did you miss the pleasures of the city?  

 It's me right?  Please...

 I say nothing.  I just hold her.  Inhale her essence.  Her desert blood, the myrrh, the stars screaming across the Night and a life not meant to be lived without her.
 
""I had a fight with my parents"" sniffs Kym.  ""And my sister.  Brother.  The stupid neighbors and grandpa.  But grandma's cool.  Says Hi.""

 ""Hello grandma"" I smile.  

 ""I shaved my head.""

 My fingers run through her shaved platinum blond stubble.  The feeling excites me.  Kym changes her appearance often but she is always the most beautiful woman in the crowd.  Like a model or celebrity or some other person way out of my league.  And she breathes with her face nestled in my neck.  Her tense body sighs and melts into mine.  

 This is enough.  Fuck the world.  Let it slip into madness and flames.  Just for her smile, I'd watch everything burn.  

 Yes she knows.  I know.  But I can't help it.  I have to tease her.

 ""So...what?  You're here because...?""

 Her eyes roll beneath a tired smile that fought every single person in her world to a standstill.  She looks at me and I grin.

 ""Because I forgot my jacket"" she says.

 ""Oh?""

 ""Yeah it's cold at night downtown"" she says grabbing my hair and pulling me closer to the lion's den.  ""I'm not used to my shaved head.  Babe?  Is it ugly?""

 ""No.  You're hair is beautiful"" I say as my lips brush against hers.  

 I can hear Jason come out of his room and walk into the hallway.

 ""Can I please get my jacket?"" she breathes softly into my ear.

 ""Yes"" I say closing my eyes.  ""You'll need it when we go out tonight.""

 ""Hey!"" exclaims Jason.  ""You're back!""  

 Kym and I open our eyes, lock for a moment in our private forever...and then we break the spell for the fool.  Jason stands behind us in tighty-whitey underwear and his The Dodger's Suck! t-shirt.

 ""Great."" says Jason.  ""Dishes in the sink bitch.""

Started with hydros and went straight to opana. I love the stuff! I know this sounds like something a ""junkie out of sound mind"" would say, but when I have my opies I feel like how I think I'm supposed to feel. I'm not anti-social anymore, I have enough energy to get shit done, etc.

 Anyways, I've fully kicked three times in eight years for about 6 months each. A pure hell we all know. Now, I'm on my longest run. I want to quit for various reasons, but it just seems impossible. I can't take time off work for it, which I WILL need. ""Hey boss, let me get the next two weeks off so I can stop popping pills."" 

 Well, I've tried anyways. Every time I man up and say no more, or even when I'm flat broke and can't afford anything, it's like there's a junkie god up there watching over me. Someone will have freebies for me EVERY TIME.

 Well, now I want to stop again, but I know I wont without help. I POSITIVE I can do it with 7-8 subs. (suboxone/subutex)  The only problem is, I can't afford the doctor's visit, OR the scrip. Before I'm able to save up enough for both, I end up breaking and getting my DOC. I've tried just buying some off the street, but since the nearest doctor that prescribes them is 150 miles away, NO ONE has them. 

 It's a damned shame that prices for the doctor visit and script are so high, because I know I could get clean after 7 or 8 subs. There has to be some way to negate this predicament. ",1442902801.0
3lwdpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3lwdpy/question_about_dosing/,3,https://redd.it/3lwdpy,cannablissy,Question about dosing;,"Hey fam, just a quick question that I may even end up answering on my own, but just want some verification to make sure I understand,

I usually take 60mg oxy a day, all at once. I did this yesterday, then about 6-7 hours later I took 45mg oxy, but literally felt no effects. I'm not even sure my high was maintained at this point, I felt no nod, little euphoria, etc.

My question is, was this because I'm used to a 60mg dosing, & when I did 45mg it didn't stack on to the 60mg I had in my system, but rather just acted as a method to ""maintain"" the current high I had going? They say take every 4-6 hours but I was probably at the 7 hour mark if I'm being real, so maybe there wasn't anything left to maintain? 

Just trying to figure out if it's tolerance issues or dosing issues. In my mind, 105mg in one day might be the most I've done in a while, but if it was spread out at 60mg and 45mg, it wouldn't be like taking 105mg at once, correct? 

Sorry if this is common science, I've just never not had any effect happen to me in a while, lmao. I just took 30mg today, at once, & felt better but not euphoric for obvious reasons, so I feel like I should have felt that 45mg dosing regardless.

Here I am lying in bed at my grandparents house. In a similar position as I was a little over a year ago. My mind is slowly coming back to me. Enough at least to where I can no longer ask myself ""How did I get here?"" I know damn well how I got to this point and I know I did it all to myself. Maybe I had a little help along the way. Enablers come and go. But in the end no one forces us to smoke that blunt, to sniff that line, and they sure as hell don't force the needle into our veins. That wasn't my experience at least. 

This last binge has been one of the longest and hardest I have put my body and mind through. I know I can't keep doing this to myself. So why then do I continue down the path to self destruction? I can make excuses till I'm blue in the face but in the end getting high is just easier. It's easier than coming to terms with the fact that I have a problem that I just continue to let grow and fester like an oozing abscess. It's easier than staring into the cold blue eyes of that demon which mimics my every move. It's easier than watching my mother break down in tears for the hundredth time begging me to just make her understand the reasons behind it all.

I had it all. The world at my fingertips begging for me to take it by the reins. And I pissed it all away. I made the decisions that have made me who I am today. And I wouldn't trade all the dope in the world for the life experiences I have gained along the way. But I still have regrets.

Please feel free to leave feedback good or bad. I hope you guys find this somewhat worth the time to read. I haven't written this much in a few years.

Then I railed another 1/5 so i was up to probably 20-25 mg now. the rush was intense and it hard so hard that the euphoria was greaaat. i much prefer this method to oral. gonna try to plug the rest of the powder after i make it into a little solution. will update.

tldr: snorted pure methadone powder evaporated from cwe, no burn, rushing in 10 or 20 min, same duration, more euphoric and harder hitting, it actually gives a nice rush and peaks much quicker than oral. gonna try pluggin powder now.",1442878615.0

I am a chipper who snorts while C is a full-blown addict who shoots. For a long time, C would help me get dope, but always middle. I would always hook her up well, but obviously I would prefer a real connect and I tried to make this known to her. I went out of town for the summer and last saw her when I came back at the beginning of August. I asked her if she could help me get a g. C offered to do me one better. She'd introduce me to her connect in exchange for .2. I was perfectly happy to do this as that's probably what I would've given her anyway. When we met B, he hooked C up with a free g for the new customer. They seemed very chill with one another, and it was good dope.

I continued to cop from him through penultimate week of August, then stopped. One of these times we talked for like 10 minutes and he mentioned how he and C were pretty good friends. I haven't done dope since then. I have hit him up twice in the last 3 weeks but he has not responded at all. 


Well today I finally got B's new number and texted him to see if I could get a g today. He texts back a half hour later or so saying yeah, but I have to go get a new phone so I tell him I'll be a while. Fucking AT&T store ends up being like a $15 uber ride away and takes them an hour to exchange my phone. C texts me and tells me she can get better dope than B has for the same price and she could pick me up from where I was. This sounds good to me so she comes and gets me and we cop. On the way she is telling me that B hasn't been answering calls from her all morning and when I mentioned he had texted me she is peeved. She tries to call him again but he doesn't answer. I think she thought her phone was maybe fucking up, so she asked if she could use mine. I call B and when he picks up I tell him ""one second"" and hand the phone to her. She starts talking to him and it quickly becomes clear that he was avoiding her phone calls because he's pissed at her over a car which he bought from her recently which has some issue that just came to light and is getting mad at her over piddling amounts of money he said he'd pay her related to the car, like $50 or something. C was calm and wasn't yelling or acting hostile she was really just confused as to why he was mad.


When they finally get off the phone I immediately text B and apologize for giving her the phone as I had no idea they had any kind of disagreement. He texts me back telling me ""he ain't ones to play games wit"". I honestly don't care if I lose him as a connect because apparently he cuts with brown sugar now and I'm not interested in that. But still feel like I kinda got fucked over being in the middle here. Like I didn't do shit but still get fucked out of a connect. For letting someone use my phone... Oh well.

I only really like opana as an opiate and it is better to snort. Should I snort some water? I have used afrin which can work really well. Thanks guys.,1442863750.0

I got clean from narcotics on October 14, 2014 and my 1st anniversary would have been coming up soon but I ended up going to the ER this morning at the butt crack of dawn because of a chronic stomach pain waking me up. Thought I was passing a kidney stone or maybe it was appendicitis but it turned out to be nothing serious, but before I got my catscan results the nurse gave me an IV drip for dilaudid and zofran. I wish I'd have told her about my addiction so I could go a different route but I didn't tell her and it scares me that this one weak moment may lead to more in the near future. I've been doing so good with staying away from any situations that would test my strength and now that I was just in one, I realize I'm not as strong as I thought. Doesn't mean I won't still try though. I suppose this was just a bump in the road and now I can move on and keep trying to stay on the right path and make the right decisions for myself. It just upsets me I guess that I wasted almost 12 months of clean time for one unnecessary hospital visit and that IV won't leave my mind because I want to feel like that all the time.

No but really. I considered this guy a friend. When I bought dope, I smoked him out. When I got bars, i'd throw him one. I bought him food when he was hungry. We were just...friends. You know? Not best best friends but I thought we got along well.


So last thursday former friend texts me and says he just got out of jail. Got picked up on a warrant or something. He says he is totally broke and needs food and diapers for his kid. Now I work 2 jobs but i'm still in no position to be paying other peoples bills - I don't even have a car. But I try to help when I can and I lend him 30.


He tells me that he swears on his dad's grave that he will pay me back the following tuesday (today). I contact him all day...no response. So I go on with my day and hang w/ my lady friend who happens to be sick because she hasnt gotten well all day. Well I go to my connect to buy my ladyfriend a little wellness bag. As im buying it my connect says ""yo, have you seen former friend? he owes me $100 and hes been dodging me for days""


Suddenly it all came together. I dont think my former friend went to jail or needed money for diapers. I'm pretty sure hes just a piece of shit who would end a pretty beneficial friendship for 30 dollars. Being out 30 sucks but at least I know his true colors now, and other people do too. 

Looking back I feel a little used. I have 2 jobs so $30 isnt a huge deal to me but its just the principle. Im gonna let him have his little victory this time but he lost a good friend and I will most definitely be bringing up this story any time that his name comes up in conversation.

I'm talking about going cold turkey ( with help ) not weaning/tapering.

Well if I'm planning on taking a tolerance break, quitting (inevitability only temporarily), or what have you I prefer to do it by bypassing the usual agony that come with withdrawals.

For such an occasion I gather:
•Xanax/Klonopin/Ativan,whatever
•Suboxone (A MUST )
•Edibles or Mushrooms or Acid

So I usually take my last dose around noon the day before I plan on kicking, because that just means I get to take the sub earlier the next day :D (I usually wait 24-36 hours in order to get fuller effects).I take a pretty fat shot so I won't feel sick until around 9 or 10 in the morning .
First I wake up around 7,immediately take a kpin or what have you( Takes the edge off and steers away any opiate cravings for the time being ).
Second I take an edible or tab or some shrooms to take my mind to another place and this tends to help me forget any physical symptoms of withdrawal. 
Finally as soon as I'm coming down its about time to take a piece of a suboxone.
I continue this process, minus the tripping, for the next several days and it has worked to keep me clean for as little as one week to as long as 2 months!

I know some just say fuuck it and just go cold turkey and drench 4 different shirts with sweat, vomit uncontrollably (sometimes bile, which sucks balls ), and shiiit violently all day cuz I have but sometimes its nice to ""cheat"" ya know.

Black is my home base, my main squeeze, my partner in crime. However, I've dabbled in Adderall/Vyvanse a couple times and had enjoyable experiences every time. For me, opiates and stims are at opposite sides of the spectrum, and I wasn't really curious about trying them, meth in particular. Why would I want to be geeked out when I use drugs mainly to chill out? 

Well, my dealer ended up getting hold of some, and gave me a bag 20 worth. He hooked it up VERY well I might add. I tried it at his place, really nervous, but took a big hit, blew out, and didn't feel much. Took one more hit, blew out, and I felt like I was on top of the world. To be specific, it felt like a dirty Adderall high; not a big rush, but lasted a long time. I took it home, smoked a little bit (off foil) from my 20 bag every couple of hours, and before I knew it, I finished most of the bag by 2:30 in the morning. I felt alright. Not as good as when I first tried it, but I felt good. 

Then, things start to get fucked. I keep hallucinating people walking around. I see bugs flying around, spiders that aren't there. People are calling my name, knocking on my door. Fast forward: I can't sleep, take a cold shower, and fucking CRASH at around 2 in the afternoon. When I say crash, I mean fucking plummet. I instantly swung into a dark, full on depression. I felt like there was no reason to be alive. I felt so fucking terrible guys. I'm only sticking to black and the occasional benzo from now on. Jesus Christ. Love you guys.

Click. 

I look over to my buddy in the passenger seat with the shit eating grin that has come to symbolize one thing - we are going on some sort of adventure. I pull the window back that opens up to the bed of my truck and tell the two dirty hippies in the back what the plan is. 

It is now somewhere around the 36 hour mark of no sleep. The previous night I had picked up a ten strip of some Lucy. I along with the two dirty hippies ate some immediately. Josh has decided to save the two hits I sold him earlier in the week till the following day. I sell the other half his friend Dave and we all head over to a pool in a neighborhood in the suburbs to kill some time. 

The pool is surrounded by a gate to keep out the riffraff. Chairs and tables are everywhere so we get all our backpacks out and start unloading our supplies. Daniel performs a beautiful swan dive straight into the pool, clothes and all. Everything starts flowing together in a liquidy fashion. transferring the thoughts in my head into English is becoming a challenge. 

We have each claimed a table as our own by this point. I look over at daves table and he is holding a flashlight in his mouth while trying to cook a shot in the dark. After staring at him until it's no longer funny I say fuck it and decide to help the poor bastard. I find a light switch to turn on small fixture above our little spot and try and find a vein for him as he does the old pump and clench. TEAMWORK. And he has blasted off. Talking a hundred miles a minute. 

Satisfied with my handiwork I begin working on myself. I pull out my backpack and empty the contents on the table. Clothes. Nope. Marlboros. Hoho not yet sir. AHA. My little black bag. I unzip and study the remnants. Still got a little less than half a gram of MXE, enough dope to last till the comedown, and some pot. 
I reach back into my backpack and pull out a new pack of the pointy little devils. Set aside two. Cycle through the motions and I'm feeling wonky again. The acid is in full effect at this point.

I look over at my other two friends who have yet to say a word. Just chillin. Sprawled out on some lawn chairs waiting for it to kick in. I offer them a bump each and they happily oblige. It'll hit them soon enough. The only words that leave my mouth are ""seat belts on boys."" And the howling begins. 

Several hours pass and I feel we are causing too much noise. I try to convey this to my partners in crime but I might as well be speaking mandarin. They finally catch my drift and we all start packing up. 

Back in the truck and we head to Vietnam. Vietnam sits tucked back in the woods. We pull of the dirt road and onto the trail we have made over the years. There is no light pollution, only the stars and the sounds of nature. And of course whatever music sounds fitting. Once again we go through motions and everything comes back in full swing. We talk. We chain smoke. Josh sets up a massive tent for some reason I. We talk some more. I make the call. And off to Atlanta we go again. But not before we drop Dave off. He is too much to handle sober, let alone on a head full of acid and god knows what else. 

I pull up the steep driveway and tell everyone to wait. It won't be that long. I come bursting out the door yet again with that smile. It's time to part ways with the hippies. Thanking them for their company I drop them off at a gas station. 

Josh and I glance at each other and I  see the fear in his eyes. This isn't our first trip together and won't be our last. After much deliberating we come up with a plan. Back on the interstate to get camping supplies from our houses. The  moon and sun have traded places already. I place three more tiny squares on my tongue and Daniel does the same with his two. 

100 miles an hour, static blaring over the radio we make the trek to the mountain to meet up with some old friends. Hours later we arrive. 

To be continued.

I can blame my drugs use on a million things that happened in my life, and some would agree that they would probably be doing dope too. But all in all its because I chase the feeling of being comfortably numb. For me, Getting high acts like a mental time warp and can pause the pain of life temporarily..at least inside my mind .

With opiates, the soothing bliss of being completely disconnected is pure heaven..any and all worries simply melt away for the time being and nothing matters. All hell could be breaking loose in your life, but once you check in with heroin, you check out of reality.

I've dealt with anxiety and stress that have cause many breakdowns and panic attacks, and heroin in itself is right next to xanax when it comes to anxiety relief...just more euphoric. Weed will always be my first and main love, but it's not always guaranteed to perk me up like heroin. When Im high on hop I'm friendlier to people(except for the first hour where I'm known to be a little irritable), more empathetic and caring, and I'm able to brush off negativity with ease...as well as maintain a decent buzz when dosing responsibly. I do believe there is a therapeutic relief that is provided outside of the high...but this could just be my own junkie logic.

These could merely be the word that are whispered into my ear by the gorilla that lives on my shoulder, the one that control my life more than I like. He's my advocate when I need advice, my life coach when Im stressing, my best friend when I feel alone (most of the time)...and he's also my drug fueled demon that leads me down dark alleys in search of the next high. 

He's the one that convinces me that it's reasonable to call someone I haven't seen or talked to in 5 years and ask if they can score heroin. 

He's the one that has me at he atm withdrawing my last 40 dollars to cop even though the fridge is empty, the car has no gas, the bills aren't paid and that money should be used to get to work

He's the king of bullshit and gives me the excuses I need to cover up my habit, he forms brilliant cover stories and elaborate alibis to cover my ass.His ability to turn shit into sugar and sell ice to eskimos is uncanny..he's a fuckin compulsive e liar and he's damn good at it, but his memory sucks.

He's the one that provides the reasoning for getting high that day...and he puts up an amazing argument. Whatever reason he comes up with is followed with a compelling justification for just saying ""fuck it""

Silencing out this beast allows for a moment of clarity so to say, while nothing becomes clearer and very few answers are found...it doesn't fuckin matter when your high. Being comfortably numb is what some folks need to stay sane....and people desperately crave this mental peace. Yeah, some find it in yoga, some find it in yayo...but everyone craves a break from their own thoughts.

Insomnia is another reason I have a deep set love for opiates, as the allow me to truly sleep....deep sleep, the type of sleep Michael Jackson would beg for. With opiates I am able to drift of onto a cloud of slumber with ease, other nights I toss and turn until I've seen ever hour on the clock multiple time. Heroin creates a portal into a realm of limbo, while you're not passed out, youre not quite awake either..you float in an out of conciousness and reality is a peaceful blur.

The greatest sunrise I ever saw was during a beautiful morning dose of oxycontins for breakfast. THhe rays of sun covered my body and I felt as though this would be the perfect time to die. That moment of pure peacefulness is how I hope to leave this earth..right before the DMT is released and I truly meet whatever higher power awaits.

As another day passes I continued of my path of self medication to find sanity, and knowing the gram of dope in my pocket will grant me access to another day of being comfortably numb.

May your dealers be timely, you packages be potent and your minds to be at ease from the madness of life...

The drug seems pretty cool, seems like the chemists figured out of if you add acetic anhydride to drugs it makes them more potent. Also the levo isomer of methadone is the active isomer of the chirality pair. So in layman's terms this shit must have been SRTONG.",1442969470.0

I just started Suboxone about 3 weeks ago. And to be honest it's great for keeping me in line but I don't see any hurt in using once in a while.
The big problem is that I'm supervised by a pharmacist for around 5mins after i've put the suboxone in my mouth.

Would there be a way for me to avoid absorbing the Suboxone so that as a treat, I really mean that because I see the difference in my life that the subs have initiated.

I just want to that like once a month.
Any tips?
I was thinking of coming in with a big ball of gum in my mouth, flattening it on my tongue and ""wrapping"" the subs in the chewing gum. With that method I could even carry a small pill bottle and keep each ""gum wrapper"" as an extra suboxone in case it comes down to it.

Any thought? Or better yet, a more ingenious idea?",1442966962.0

Theirs no warning of when and where Its going to happen. For me it was a gradual process, growing stronger until it became overwhelming. I remember feeling confused, what was happening? I've never felt a sensation like this before. Warm, happy, comfortable, content, infatuated, every second felt so good with her. For the first time in my life I felt like I was on top of the world. I felt like I was somebody, like I mattered at that very moment. I was a part of this earth as a piece of a greater puzzle. I could have existed in that moment forever. Fuck, I loved her. I was lucky enough to share this feeling with another at a very young age, we were both 16. Love knows not time nor boundaries. Some experience it late in life, or not at all. I never thought I would experience that feeling ever again. Being in love and falling in love are two different things. Being in love is constant, in fact one could argue it is the longest lasting thing that exists in our universe. Some believe love even out lasts time. Falling in love is the beginning of that eternal feeling, the big bang. When all that emotion crashes into your body.

3lyd9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3lyd9q/august_17th/,48,https://redd.it/3lyd9q,_HolyMacaroni,August 17th,"On August seventeenth my relationship with heroin changed forever.

Boyfriend and I were staying at my father's house while he and my family were on vacation a few states away. Dad has a pool, an awesome screened in porch, etc., so we offered to watch the house in his absence and utilize his amenities while we were at it. 

Monday, August 17th; the dope man has flaked out on me the past two days, I'm hurting. I have work the next morning, I know there's no way I'll even make it if I don't get my hands on something before morning. Boyfriend is blissfully unaware of my ""little habit"", so if I do cop it has to be right under his nose. 

Get ahold of my guy, beg him to help me out by leaving me a little something in my dad's mailbox. It's getting close to bedtime at this point, I'm feeling shittier by the minute, this guy is my last hope and against all odds he comes through! Tells me he's got my back and to check the mail in an hour or so. 

Fast forward, boyfriend is sound asleep and I am fiending. I literally sprint to the mailbox, grab my shit, slip back inside, hole up in the bathroom and set up. Because I'm a paranoid fuck, I turned the shower on just in case someone tried to listen to what I was doing. 
 
Because I'm really REALLY trying to quit at this point, I do the ""responsible"" thing and do maybe half of what I normally would to get rocked. I'm just trying not to be sick anymore, and I'm trying to make this shit last through the next day. 

Whoosh. High. Way higher than I expected. I take my shirt off, (better to corroborate my ""shower"" story, should anyone ask) (dumb) quickly stash my shit in the bathroom closet until morning, and crawl into bed next to boyfriend, who is still snoozing and none the wiser.

There are alarms going off in the back of my mind. There is a black fog in the corners of my vision, and I fall out. 

My boyfriend wakes up to me making choking noises and turning blue. I'm unconscious and not breathing. His phone is dead, and mine has a password which I've carefully guarded from him in order to protect my dirty little secrets. He figures out the emergency button on my iphone and calls 911. They do their best to talk him through CPR, with which he has no previous experience. They have him carry me from the bed into the living room, do chest compressions and try to breathe for me, none of which is working. After what seems like forever (his words), the police are the first on the scene. They search the room we were sleeping in and the bathroom, find and confiscate my shit, and wait around for the paramedics. By the time the paramedics arrive I'm dead. 

They work on me for somewhere between 15 and 20 minutes, breathing for me and trying to restart my heart. Through some miracle of miracles it works, I come back and they immediately administer narcan. 

My lungs fill with air, my eyes open (as best they can), and I'm peering through my eyelashes at six men standing over me. There is a contraption in my nose, a tube down my throat, and I feel like I've been hit by a truck. 

A bearded man asks if I've used any substances tonight. I choke out ""heroin"", and immediately throw up on the floor. I'm somehow transported onto a gurney, over the side of which I vomit pretty much continuously on the ride from my father's front door to the ambulance. 

In the ambulance I'm slowly regaining my sense of self, my awareness of my surroundings. The man riding with me hooks me up to an IV. I have my hand over my face and I'm swearing, over and over again. All I can think about is how royally I've just fucked over my life, and that I wish they hadn't brought me back. 

The paramedic gives me a brief rundown of what happened. He tells me that he was the one breathing for me, and that I was dead when they arrived. I thank him; he tells me no, thank your boyfriend, if he hadn't woken up and called us when he did you wouldn't be here. He then thanked me for waking up. He told me that he's been on his fair share of overdose calls, and that more than half of those calls have resulted in death. He then thanked me for coming back, because nothing ruins his week like not being able to save someone. 

Precipitated withdrawals sucked ass. My boyfriend stuck by my side through everything, my father drove home the next morning to bring me to rehab, which my stepmom stepped up and shelled out nine grand for. 

On August seventeenth I gained a new respect for what we do, and I made a decision to stop doing it.

If I take an opioid, will it have ANY central effects?","First off, I fully realize that this question has likely been beaten to death, but I cannot find a case of someone in the exact position I am currently in.

I have been weaning off of Suboxone... I was at 1mg (from the standard 2mg dose obviously) for about a week, and for the last few days, have been on only 0.7mg (or 35mg of the 2mg pill, which weighs exactly 100mg total - measured with a high-precision scale) of Bupe.

I understand that Buprenorphine has an extremely potent ability to antagonize the Mu opioid receptors, and that TYPICALLY one does not feel the effects of opioids while on it. However, I am currently only on 0.7mg of Buprenorphine, and in withdrawal from the tapering. I have heard that buprenorphine's antagonistic effects are only effective past a certain threshold dose - meaning that people who are on minuscule doses might actually feel the effects of an additional opioid when consumed. Would this apply to me? 

Basically, I just want to know if anyone has any idea of the dose at which Suboxone will fail to fully antagonize the Mu receptors, and thus fail to block 100% of an opioid high.",1443110045.0

If you didn't know the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, was in Seattle the last few days. Yesterday he was travelling all around the seattle area in a massive motorcade, blocking off every street/freeway he travelled on. So yesterday I was working from home because of the expected traffic from his motorcade but I still needed to run downtown to cop. So I wait till around 1pm to try and avoid any potential traffic. I cop no problem and it takes just a few minutes before I'm back in my car and driving. I go to the I5 freeway entrance and once I'm past the point of no return all traffic just stops. So I get out of my car and start walking towards the freeway and see that the cops have the entire northbound side of I5 completely blocked off. Everyone is like what the fuck how can they block off all i5 traffic especially since its getting close to rush hour (it's like 2:45 at this point). We proceed to sit there for an hour and as you can imagine my mind is just making my body sicker and sicker knowing that I have dope but no way to use (didn't bring any foil or lighter). After an hour and they finally open the freeway. I expect the backup was around 10 miles and at least I was fortunate enough to be near the front. Anyways this post was mostly a story but also just to say that the Chinese presidents choices of travel were so stupid. If you have the resources to shut down a major freeway then you have the resources to take a helicopter. Our own president was in Seattle last year and didn't cause anywhere close to the problems this guy did. I don't understand how the city let this fly. Again take a fucking helicopter, now the citizens of seattle are going to fucking hate him for shutting down the city for 3 days just so he could ""tour"" the area. 

I'm on my way to work now so hopefully it doesn't take hours because of him travelling again. End of rant.",1443108298.0

So I have a urine analysis for my sub doc in two days. Yes, I fully understand that genuinely getting clean and not rolling the dice would have been the way to go. But not called an addict for nothing. 

My plan is to pick up one of those urine kits. Which has always worked just fine - I get to go into a closed, private bathroom. Last time around though - he informed me he was going to be testing for the subs, to make sure I've been taking them, and not selling them or whatever mischief I could be up to (they're also counting my wrappers, what happens after 3 strikes apparently). 

So my question - does a urine test for bupe (my brand of suboxone is zubsolv, not sure if that makes a difference or not) *the chemical* **or** *some sort of metabolite??* If it is the chemical, well I suppose I can just drop a piece of a sub in the urine and it'll show up. Otherwise, if I have to actually need it to be metabolized - well, I'm going to need a person for that. I'd jump straight to that, but it seems I don't know literally a single person with no drugs at all in their system. Everyone has at least pot or kpins or some shit. 

But, ya, there ya go. Is bupe detected as a metabolite during a UA or just as the chemical bupe?

I'm stopped taking pharmaceuticals entirely after experiencing Ayahuasca earlier this year.  I can't describe the profound healing effect this combination of plant matter had on me in words.  But so far I have not needed to fill any of my medications for chronic pain in many months.  I tapered down for 3 months before my trip, I didn't want to torture myself cold turkey after 15 years of prescribed opiates.  

Now, I'm not a saint by any means.  I have a solid career and I'm still rather young, no family but totally self sustaining and provide to society.  But I've heard the value of these Opana 40mg are absolutely insane on the streets.  Are they the best opiate in pill form?  I'm very curious what they sell for on average, realistically, and what areas of NA vary the most. I have connections to dealers who would gladly take them off of me, and I could indulge in a new 4k TV or some other toys.  The devil on my shoulder has been whispering in my ear to sell these for weeks.  The angel on the other side says ""you are an idiot, don't risk your career for a short thrill"".  

That said, I at least want to know the real prices.  I ready anywhere from $20 to $60 per pill, which seems crazy high. I highly doubt I could find someone to buy all 240 at once, for the street value.  I wouldn't dare consider dropping them 10 at a time or some shit.  1 hook, 5 minutes, I'm out.  Any info appreciated, be safe out there.",1443081820.0

I couldn't say shit since, well, I am junkie and he was clear that his anger is not directed at me. That said, it was definitely a weird experience to say the least. 

Don't get me wrong; I have been on both sides of the equation. I have waited hours to score and hours to sell. I have dealt with all the bullshit and then some that you could imagine. I never though, took my anger out on my customers (other than the few who fucked up here or there but they have always been strait afterwards, especially when I call them out of their shit). 

I guess what I am asking is this : Can anyone think of a profession that has such animosity between buyers and sellers?

I feel we are drawing attention even though we are traveling down the interstate in truck and everyone is trapped in their own little world. 



""Stop throwing the fucking beer cans out the window."" 

""Fuck off dad. Oh and by the way that was the last one.""


Horns blare as i swerve across four lanes and onto the exit ramp. God we stick out here in bumfuck Alabama. Josh's clothes sag off his tall wirey frame. Tallapoosa is now place for a man with piercings and blue hair. Luckily our gas station servant has an eyebrow ring. I scurry off back to the vehicle as I am not of age. 


""I think we should wait until..""

*pop* ..... *fssssss*

""What were you saying?""

""Never mind. Let me get a sip of that.""


I phone my buddy, Wes from college that we are supposed to be meeting up with once we get to the top of the mountain but the reception is nonexistent. I don't know what he has taken but the following text I received from him lets me know he is far from sober. 


At this point I feel as though the roads have gained sentience and are trying with all their might to prevent us from reaching the top. In hindsight we would have been blessed had that been our greatest obstacle of the night. Every break in the tree line greets us with a reminder of our impending doom should we make one false move. 


We make it to what appears to be the top and release the tension in our aching bodies. Parked beside us are some good ol boys drinking what appears to be alcohol. Social interaction becomes string theory.


""Hey. Um. So. Yeah.""

""What?""

Where can we uhh. Where can we beer?""

""Ohhhh. I guess wherever!""


More intoxicating substances begin their way into our digestive tracts. And socializing becomes a little less algebraic.


We decide to set up the tent and worry about meeting up later. On the road again. After driving a few more miles down 281 we find what seems like a decent spot to set up. I cannot form a coherent thought at this point. I look to Josh and somehow convey that it is that time again. Disgusted and tired of watching the ritual he begins to set up the tent. 


Oh shit oh shit oh shit. And I'm gone. There is a very fine line between just right and way too much. And I overshot it by a mile. I am trapped in my mind once again. I see things no human should ever witness. I scream but there is no one around to here. We are deep in nature. I live a thousand lifetimes and come back to see Josh slowly approaching me with a bewildered look on his face. And I break down in tears. After a few minutes of consoling me he asks, 


""Was that you screaming?""

""Yeah. I think I did too much mxe again.""  

""I'm sorry dude. I couldn't figure out how to set up the tent.""

""Fuck this place man lets find Wes.""


Off we go again in search of Wes. My mind is still shattered into a million pieces and the glue is nowhere to be found. We spend a couple hours driving up and down 281 in hopes that I recognize his car. The tank is on E. Broken and with our tails between our legs we head down the mountain to a gas station. 


Finally we get reception so I try to reach Wes and we meet up. I do my best to describe what happened but it just isn't possible. They decide to call it a night. 


There is no way I am making it into work tomorrow. We stay at the gas station and plan our next move. I go through my contacts and phone all my coworkers to try and find a cover for my shift. After explaining some variation of the truth to my coworker Jenna she agrees to go in for me. I call the GM to clear it with her and she denies my request. After some choice words I decide the time has come and let them know I will not be coming in tomorrow or again for that matter. 


I  replay the conversation to Josh with Jenna on speaker and she is just far enough off her rocker to want to join me. After asking all the important questions like, ""How much money do you have in the bank?"" and ""what are you holding right now?"" We decide to go pick her up. But not before she enlightens me to the fact she is still
in highschool and living with her parents. After a quick googling of the age of consent in Georgia and a couple more questions we are all set. In the end the crazy one are always the most fun. ",1443072324.0

I put about 50mg of DNM #3 in a bowl, so I put about that much on the foil.  I can get it to run, and I blow out misty vapor clouds that are best seen under a light otherwise they're barely visible.

My little sister and I were very close. She called me daily. We always hung out. She always wanted to hear about the guys I dated. Even wanted to set me up a few times haha. 

I am 2 years older than her so we grew up together and had the same friends. Our rooms were next to each other even. 

As we got older we just got closer. She'd always tell me how proud she was of me (I had a kick ass career and life was just generally great)

But on December 2nd, 2011 I got a phone call from my mom to drive home. I fought her. It was midnight and I lived 90 minutes from home. But I still got in my car and drove home. 

I first tried calling my sister to see what's going on. She didn't answer her phone. I didn't think anything of it. 

When I got in the door, I could tell my mom was crying. Oh shit. 

""Carlie was in a car accident. She didn't make it""

I threw up. I spent the next 12 hours just not even believing it. My parents had to take my phone away from me so I'd stop calling her. It was bad. 

To this day we don't know what caused the accident. But I do know horrible details about the accident that makes it worse (she laid in the snow alone before she died, and the ambulance was just pulling up as she passed. )

At the funeral everyone kept saying how beautiful she was. My parents had her wearing her favorite zebra print shirt and her hair curled. Yes, she was beautiful. 

I spent the next month seeing her face every time I closed my eyes and just in a general fog. I quit my job, left my apartment and moved home. 

My mom started giving me her oxy and I never stopped. 

I haven't been clean long term since then. 

When I talk to people about my habit they often say, ""your sister wouldnt want...'

And I lose it every time. It's so old.

It's been 3 years and I've only gotten worse. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore. I hope I'll stay clean, and I'll be in an environment conducive to it. So it won't be hard.

My mom passed away in 2012 due to lung & brain cancer, & I thought I had a grip on things, but promptly found myself moving across the country a year later, almost to date. I told myself I moved for a lot of reasons, to escape the heroin boom that came to my small city & creeped up on my friends, to move with the love of my life whose hometown just happened to be 2500 miles away, to travel the country like my mom never got to do before she passed---I told myself a lot of things but the past few years I've realized that I'm running from really having to deal with my moms death. 

We were close but not as close as we could or should have been, but she was in my life daily & I thought I had a little more time with her. Even from diagnoses to death, we only knew she had cancer for 2 months. 

I had my life pretty much in order out here for the past few years, some financial ups and downs but those are to be expected.

Only recently have I been suffering from sleeping issues again. As a kid I had night terrors and as a teen I went through insomnia, but I've been using sleeping pills & drugs to keep the sleeps ever since my early twenties. Now, when I do knock myself out to sleep I have dreams about my mom. Dreams where we sit and talk about things that we've never talked about before, so I'm not replaying old conversations in my head. I enjoy the time in dream world I get to spend with her so much, I force myself to stay asleep almost all day now. I wake up to take drugs to put me back out again, just so I can see her again, hear her again. 

I know this isn't healthy & that it's fucking up my life. It's keeping me from properly getting another job, causing depression when I am awake, making me isolate my girlfriend & resent her mom for even being alive...

Have any of you lost a parent yet? How do you move on? I feel constantly stuck in the past but I don't want to give up this time with her, or the idea of her. I know I probably need counseling for grief but I feel like I can't talk about it correctly. I'm not very good dealing with my own mental problems, I come from a family that doesn't admit to mental issues and my father & brother are rather cold in regards to talking about my mom. 

I'm not sure where to look or how to find help, or even if any of you understand or are dealing with this yourself. Maybe I could talk to some of you guys here, I feel like a know a lot of you just from our drug tales. I think I need some help. Maybe just hearing about your parents or your home lives will help me out here. If this isn't the proper thing to be posting I will delete, just let me know mods, sorry, I didn't feel comfortable going anywhere else, oddly enough.

Here goes, please contribute if you have the time:



• Get an all day public bus pass, if you dont wheels ($6)

• Steal $30-$50 worth of product from my main foodstore chain (Birthday candles can get pricey plus they're small. Batteries too)

• Get on bus go to another (same chain) grocery store

• Return stolen product for a store-credit gift card at new store to avoid suspicion from the store you stole the goods at (never return to the same store you stole from)

• Walk around parking lot picking up old receipts (look in nearby garbage cans too)

• Keep the receipts where the person used cash only, throw away credit card ones

• Buy the items on the receipt with gift card

• Get on bus, go to another (same chain) grocery store

• Return the stuff you bought with the gift card using the receipt you found earlier.

• Watch as cashier hands you cold hard cash

Don't abuse this hustle, not only because it's wrong and illegal, but because the store managers/workers get to know your face and know your hustle. I've been denied a few times because of that.

They wouldn't really judge me but I don't want to deal with all the ""be careful"" comments. 

Just picked up my first 2 points all on my lonesome last night. Only ever done with one of not so close friends. And she has a tendency to go overboard in all aspects. Unfortunately (or fortunately I guess depending on your preference) I am on the west coast so Black tar is pretty much all we got. I don't bang, nor do I plan to as I'm deathly afraid of needles and I don't really want to clog up my veins. So that's fine with me. 

Every time I've done it my friend has helped me chase the dragon. I'm pretty much incapable of doing it on my own as I found out last night with my tester matchstick head amount. All I got was a headache and a shitty half high stupor. So this morning I get up and I look up some ways to go about ingesting this shit. 

I keep my tolerance relatively low, and I've only ever smoked it so I was cautious of other ROA's. Finally settled on the monkey water technique. I prep it on my spoon, get ready to take my tiny little snort... And as I'm closing in the vinegar smell makes me puke. Pathetic right? Thankfully I didn't lose any of the goods (which I'd started at a modest 25mgs.) so I have an ingenious idea. 

Time for the good ol oil check. I grab the lube, the oral syringe, and prep the brown eye. Then up she goes. I do a little tester squirt. A little over half of the 25ish mgs. Instantly glad I listened to the voice in the back of my head and didn't push the whole thing. This shit is decent. 

Now I'm sitting here, relaxing, having a good old time. Glad I took some benadryl because I'm already nauseous. Probably would have puked again if I hadn't taken it.  Anyway thankfully I have a good loving girlfriend who doesn't do dope to keep me honest. I feel like a 13 year old bragging to his friends he just got some ""really dank weed guise"" but all I know is I'm high and happy. 

Also it's my birthday today. So happy birthday to me. Yay. Time to go puke, and the put on some Chopin. I guess I forgot to mention my birthday is why I decided to pick up. Have a good day guys.",1443040004.0

First off, I'd just like to say this has been a great thread to read here, some of you have some really touching stories

Anyway, I'm polydrug user. I use a lot of drugs, but I'm generally as safe as you can be with drugs. Weed, MDMA, hallucinogens of all sorts, benzos, and of course opiates/opioids. The only things I really don't use are alcohol and stimulants. All my close friends know I use drugs, as I'm often high around them, but not a single person in the world knows about my dope use.

The other week though, while hanging out with some people,  the topic of Vicodin comes up, and everyone is talking about how much fun it is to pop pills and drink a little. The conversation extends to heroin and of course the drug is immediately demonized (again, amongst a bunch of people who blow pills), and being the informed drug user I am, I mention that heroin is very similar to other opiates. Immediately I get attacked for that statement, with people saying anything from that I'm horribly misinformed to outright calling me a dumbass, and everyone prattles on about horror stories they've heard 2nd (and 3rd and 4th hand) about dope fiends and about how heroun is SO MUCH more intense than OC80s and other pills

Being the idiot I am, I blurt out that they have no idea what they're talking about, and that if they tried it they'd realize it's really not that different or worse than all the pills they've been ranting and raving about. Obviously I get immediate attacked for being a dumbass and an asshole and just generally disparaged by the group for having tried H. The conversation goes on and people start calling me a failure, how I've thrown my life and way, talking about how I've gone over the edge, etc etc. So to save face, I just chime back in and say I was lying, I hadn't tried it, and was just saying that to win the argument (I'm generally an argumentative person, so most people believed me that I was bullshitting to win). After I say that, I get a lot of sighs of reliefs and people saying things like ""wow fringe, for a second I thought we were gonna have to cut you out"". These are some of my really good friends here, who basically were yapping about how there was nothing left of our friendship because of one drug I choose to occasionally use.


Now, I'm just a chipper of opiates. Some times I go a couple times a week, other times i go months without using. My tolerance is nothing, and I only smoke H or blow/swallow pills, so we're talking doses of 10-20mg, nothing that's gonna send me to the ER. I'm financially very successful, somewhat irresponsible with time commitments but otherwise very good at staying on tops of things, and basically have my shit together. 

I guess what I'm getting at is - how can people who are supposed to be your friends, who do plenty of hard drugs (including coke, which Id argue is MUCH worse than opiates), who for the most part are nowhere near as put together as I am (don't mean to sound conceited here, just giving relative context) be so quick to throw people out of their lives over something that doesn't even affect them? I just don't get it, and it just reinforces my longstanding view that I have to hide everything about my opiate use. Maybe I should just cut these people out of my life...


Tl;dr: was talking about opiates with friends who occasionally pop pills, topic of H comes up, I mention I chip, and all hell breaks loose. I end up saying I was lying about using H to prove a point, for the most part everyone buys it, but they all were ready to cut me out of my life for it. What's wrong with people?

Wes, will and I all met in college. It seems like drug users just gravitate towards each other, like some sort of radar.

 I had been saving a little cash from each paycheck toward the trip. A week before we were set to leave I discovered heroin. The $650 I had saved for the trip quickly dropped to around $250 in that short time before we left. Luckily I had stockpiled some supplies beforehand. Packed underneath all my clothes sat a ten strip of acid, some dmt, 5 capsules of foxy, and a few grams of mxe. My beautiful muse was not pleased to discover my new love affair with poppy and I would soon pay for my betrayal.

As we got closer to the date of our departure, the slower time seemed to progressed. I had taken off work a month in advance so there would be no confusion in the scheduling.there was no way I would be called in to cover somebody shift.  I was determined to have a good time with my friends after not being together for the past four months. Plus work had begun to take its toll on me and I feared if I didn't have a break soon I would snap. 

I loaded all my bags into my beat to shit truck and set off for Alabama to pick up wes. As soon as i get to the Georgia Alabama line i pull over for a pit stop. As I'm walking to the bathroom i spot a robot carrying some water. I hand the thieving bastard two dollars in exchange for a bottle and head to the restroom. People sneak glasses as I make my way into the handicap stall. I pull out my small bag of felonies and begin the ritual. Thinking ahead I attempt to prepare an extra dropper full mxe for later. 

*POW*

I look down and anxiety starts to flow through my mind. My shleigh for the dmt is now in a million pieces on the ground, along with baggies of Internet drugs, a spoonful of wonk and syringes. I gather up everything minus the pipe and dart out the door. Cranking up the truck I speed off back towards the interstate. 


After making sure I'm not being followed I pull over at the next exit to empty the contents of the one needle I was able to prepare. A bitter metallic taste instantly takes over my senses. My vision goes wavvy and everything feels okay. The panic instantly fades and I get  back to the desired route.

I remembered back in college Wes told us a story about his pot dealer in Birmingham trying to sell him heroin at some point in time. I call him to see if he still has number. He gives it to me. At this point none of my friends are aware that I am using junk, so when I asked for his number he handed it over no problem. 

A couple hours later and I have arrived. Wes is still at work until 5 so I have time to kill. The front door is locked so I look around for another entrance. I find a screened in patio and decide that this will have to do.  Double, then triple checking to make sure I am alone I get the supplies out again. Oh how the ritual has changed. There is no metallic taste this time. Only the warm embrace of a new mistress. I mix in a little mxe so she doesn't get too lonely. Bliss. I wake up to his dad asking me if I'm alright. 

""Yes sir. Just thought I'd take a nap until Wes got back.""

""We'll come on in and make yourself at home. Feel free to use the pool if you'd like. Wesley should be home here shortly.""

""Alright sir I appreciate it.""

I have always had a way with parents. Kindness and respect will carry you a long way in life. Thankfully I was smart enough  to put the supplies back into my backpack before nodding out on the lawn chair. 

After a shower I unload all my stuff into the basement and wait. Finally my friend gets home and I load everything back up into his car. We have a 9 hour journey to make and a gig to play before we can even leave the state. After more pleasantries with his folks we are off. 

The defenders of the universe play a 8 song set while I sit at the bar and run up a tab. I talk with the musicians set to go on next, play a little pool, try to do anything but watch the show. The singer is a despicable little cunt who for some reason can't sing without mouth-fucking the microphone. A strange sight indeed, it's almost as if he's trying to eat the damn thing.

I can't blame them you didn't need to hear the rumors I wasn't myself I was soooo damn high all the time. I think they got tired of seeing me like that. 

I hoped that once I got better (on subs) I would have friends again but I seemed to have burned too many bridges. Doing drugs at times I thought I had friends but they never manage to stick around. All my friends from using have either gotten in too deep and burned me for dope ending our friendship or disappeared. I have 2 close friends that I would drive around with and cop daily that are now gone. Don't know if they went to jail or rehab and parents keeping it down low. I guess if they died I would know. 

I don't know if I want to stay sober or not so I feel bad going to NA and idk if I would even really make friends or if that's good.

Graduated to IV league. Basically made the switch out of necessity to shooting over snorting. Not that I can't sniff anymore (tolerance is still pretty low), just that I'm trying to conserve money because I have some serious holes in my wallet. However, I'm basically going on what I see my friends do and what I've read in safe injection technique books/fliers. 

Not to mention I'm having a much harder time than ever buying clean rigs. Seriously! I used to buy rigs for my friends who shot before me for ages, no problem. Now when I wanna shoot ever goddamn CVS has decided they will no longer be engaging in the sale of needles (this is probably a gross misrepresentation, I live in NY where its legal to buy needles in pharmacies without a prescription, but if a pharmacist of tech feels like being a dick they can just deny you. I have been rebuked EVERY time I've gone in to buy). So basically I've been cycling between 3 used rigs I have that are all clean but probably blunt as all hell. Logically it follows that I have the shittiest tracks because of this. It wouldn't be a problem...except that I live with family and my job involves dealing with other human beings.

So, how can I hit something that isn't the median cubital vein? How can I stop yelling at pharmacy techs about their ignorance spreading AIDS and just get a fresh set of rigs? And lastly, when tracks inevitably form, is there something besides makeup and long sleeves to help them heal/look better?

I'll start.

I hit up my dude and got the ok to come by. I hopped in my mom's car and headed to the west side of Atlanta. I called Cash when I was about 15 minutes away and let him know I was at the spot. Always told him that cause it took him forever to actually come by and what white boy wants to sit at a BP in west atlanta for a half hour? I sure as shit didn't. 

He finally pulls up and serves me up in his trademark, discrete, not-sketch-at-all fashion of opening my back door, leaning in without actually getting in, and handing me the bag from the back. I get my shit and roll out of there and pull into the Publix just up the street. Pretty pumped I whip out the trusty Josh Groban 2 disc cd case that my mom has had in her car for years. Start cutting out lines and finally lean over and rail a few. I bring my head up from Josh's pretty face to see two of Cobb County's finest staring right at me. Like leaning against the hood of their car and staring at me. I fucking froze. Definitely stood out with my long blonde hair and shaggy beard, white skin, and not to mention my tye dye grateful dead shirt all splashed against the background of my mom's gold CRV with a I heart my Golden Retriever sticker to really let them know I didn't belong here. 

Time froze for what felt like an hour but was probably only 3 minutes before I noticed the other cop car coming down the parking lot behind me. Then the cop car pulls into the spot next me and I tried my fucking hardest not to look sketchy sitting in a Publix parking lot staring straight ahead with the car off and no groceries in sight.

The cop car ends up rolling through the parking spot and pulls up and parks next to his cop buddies. He gets out of his black crown vic and all three walk in to the chinese restaurant next to Publix. It was like they didn't even see me, like they were staring right through me, their minds occupied with thoughts of Kung Pao chicken and pot stickers. I finally breathe after holding my breath for the entire time. I lean down and whisper sweet nothings in to Josh's ear a few more times before firing up the straight 4 engine and dipping out. I started cracking up as I was leaving and made it safe and sound back to suburbia. ",1443135546.0

I saw another story about mxe and it totally reminded me of this. Summer 2011

I've never done mxe but shrooms and Lucy are my favs next to dope. BUT my boyfriends roommate J, and his best friend R, bought some funky ass black shrooms. Like, purple, black. I told them they shouldn't eat em but you know. Shrooms. 

So me and my bf head up to bed and they eat their shit. All of a sudden, I'm being SHOOK awake with R YELLING at me that gravity is real. Oh fuck here we go. So like the good little house wife I used to be, I get dressed, tell my boyfriend not to murder him (he was FUMING seeing as our door was now off the hinges and his naked girlfriend was man handled by his best friend), and go try to... fix? him. On the couch crying, tripping face is this lanky 6ft guy. So i try to comfort him while J is just sititng on the refrigerator watching the scene. He obviously wasn't going to quit sobbing and I had NO idea how to handle it so I took perch boy to the gas station for smokes, and let my bf handle thesobbingmess. Me and J made it MAYBE 50ft away from the door and hear this blood curdling, scream. Ohfuckohfuckohfuck someone is gonna call the cops and they're beyond fucked up and ohfuck. So me and perchboy run back to the apartment to find sobbingmess backed against a wall WITH. A. BUTCHER. KNIFE. My boyfriend is ttrying to rationalize with him that it's him and he's not gonna hurt him and looks scared to death. With a lot of coaxing I FINALLY get the motherfucker to hand me the knife, or so I thought. Next thing I know he grabs ME (the only person I still think he knew was real) and is holding this 10 inch fucking blade to my throat. 

Great. 

My bf and his roommate both immediately do a 180 and start SCREAMING at him to let me go. Which in hindsight, could have ended badly. At this point, I want to use the damn knife on this fucker just to end my night. Pretty much everyone in the room is crying trying to make sure that I don't end up bleeding all over the damn floor. My boyfriend disappears up the steps and I knew exactly what was going to happen. This dumb fucking sack of skeleton comes down WITH HIS FUCKING REVOLVER. can we like, NOT have a gun pointed in my direction? Especially when someone I consider my brother is practically holding me hostage at knife point? And he could, idk, MOVE?! 

After FOURTY FIVE FUCKING MINUTES of my bf holding a gun against this kids head, him saying he doesnt want to kill me and a knife being shoved against my now bleeding throat, he finally let me go. I spend the next 20 minutes sobbing and J is a wreck. 

But this wild fucking ride doesn't end here. As I'm regaining composure and finally start having logical thoughts besides ""please don't kill me"", we hear the door shut. Oh well, we have the knife, we have the ---- fucking a my bf is a goddamn idiot. We don't have the gun, and its loaded, and psycho just left the house after holding me hostage. We are now approximately 5 hours into their trip. 

Now, outside our apartment are railroad tracks. I mean, we could slingshot eggs as passing traincars they're so close. Im sure you know where he was at. On the tracks, just sitting. Crying more.  Mind you, its about 230am on a Friday in a college town. Last call had JUST HAPPENED and we lived on a road that's a direct shot from the bars to campus. If we couldn't control him, he was gonna end up in jail, or worse, shot. 

So, me being a fucking idiot that I am, decided to try to calm him down, yet again. J is standing near the road to alert us if anyone is noticing the scene. R is crying saying how he just wants to die and he's sorry he raped me (wtf, what did he think happened???) And I try to explain that I'm not mad (it wasn't a lie, I was fucking pissed off beyond comprehension) and to just come back inside. This is when my bf finally uses his goddamn head. I see him walk over towards us out of the apartment with a huge pot. Water. He comes and just pours it all over R and me. R jumps up sending me and the gun flying. Apparently I'm promptly knocked unconscious from smashing my head against a railroad beam. So the rest of this is what my bf told me.

R starts getting pissed at my bf and screaming and then he just stops. He asks why he's wet and my bf told him he was sitting out here with a gun. R responds: fuck that, I want some cereal.  After my bf realizes that I still haven't gotten up, him and J carry me to the car and take me to the hospital. I wake up with 14 stitches in my head, a helluva headache, and very pissed off. The next couple of days are still kind of blurry even 4 1/2 years later. 

R went back home and apparently barely remembered any of it. He remembered holding a knife at the three of us, but didn't know why, he remembered taking the gun to throw it away (I think he was lying, I honestly think he wanted to kill himself) and he remembered yelling at my bf for the water and my blood all over my bf. 

Like 2 months later I got a missed call from him and he was drunk and he was apologizing for what happened and he said he wishes he could change it.  

My bf is now my ex and he's strung out on d worse than I ever have been. ODd 4 times and still going. J eventually was arrested a year later who turned into a local ci and snitching on my bf. He kept my ass safe though, he'd never let me go with my bf to !make drop offs. R was arrested for selling coke back in 2013, apparently completed probation. 

I miss them. I never saw R until 2012, right before J was popped. But I miss all three of them. J was the closest thing I've ever had to a brother. Granted that one night was super fucked up, but still. 

Probably a month before all of this happened, we were drinking and I broke down saying I didn't want to live. We were in a wooded area by my bfs grandmas and I just walked away to be alone. J came after me. I remember him screaming at me saying ""do you really want to be 6 feet under? Alone? And know that me and (my bf) and R are watching you be lowered into the ground? Do you want him to go through that? What about me?"" He started crying and I felt like the biggest peice of shit ever. 

I really miss them.

Craziest night;

Picked up 2q of down and 1p of side, already had a half ounce of fresh kush, and I have an active perspcription for ritalin 10mg pills at 60 a month, nuts. Sometimes they let me take out 3 months at one time.

Went out to my favorite park down on the lakeside at 4 am and the house that was on the property had been torn down, but the backyard stone steps were left still that gave me the perfect view of the bridge fully lit up at night, so I sat on the steps and lit up some side, big fat crystals. After 5 minutes I'm wide awake and all the lights and colors on the bridge become really intense so I decide to light up some down at the same time, dropped a couple pinches, lit up, got hit with the most intense body euphoria, and proceeded to semi nod on these steps staring at the beautiful intense lights on the bridge for an hour.

Kinda come too a bit more and get a text from a friend asking for a ride to pick up some blow, say sure, bust out 2 fat rails of ritty to try and focus me up, sunk them in seconds.

Driving over to buddies place to pick him up, walk in on him taking a bong rip and partake.

Now in my experience, as well as the fact that my ADHD seems to give me completely unique highs from the typical high, when I took that headrock, I felt all the highs come back out of nowhere like the kush brought them all back from their rapid decline, with acute intensity.

Drove buddy to our merchant, picked up in an incredibly sketchy parking lot, stopped on the side of the highway just to bust out this entire g of blow, proceed to talk about life chances and opportunities while whittling down the blow and 5 minutes after we finish it a cop drives by, does a u turn, drives by with his spot light on and drives off. 

Buddy offered his couch so I nodded out while watching Netflix.

I started using H when I was depressed about 3 years ago. For two years I was fine. I used opiates on and off. 2 weeks here, a week there. All kinds of opiates; Morphine, Fentanyl, Oxymorphone (the God King) then about 6 months ago I found a normal Heroin dealer. After that I was using Heroin every day until about a month ago.

Last month I quit cold turkey. Up until now I've been strong with my impules. It was five months on H every day but afterwards I was left with this feeling that nothing would ever be the same. No feeling I'd ever have would be as good as Heroin. I think of the birth of my child (supposing I have one) or my wedding day or any monumental event that should be the best time in my life but it won't. Nothing will be.

Heroin will always be better than that. I'm not saying I want to fully relapse but I don't want to let go of those unbelievable memories of pure bliss. I want to experience them again. 

So my question is; is it possible to go back to chipping; you know once a month or so? Can I go back to before?",1443281521.0

I feel that way about people who eat fast food and watch lots of TV, I am one of the most active people I know, and one of the healthiest, and heroin, meth, and psychedelics are all things I engage in once every couple of months. The psychedelics monthly, the harder drugs more occasionally. And I used to be a prostitute for hard drugs, I know more than most the dangers and how addiction can grab you. But it doesn't have to be that way, and I am proof. Been chipping for two and a half years now :)

The 2mg pills keep me out of withdrawal and completely sober, and I'm hoping that if I can keep doing this for a while the withdrawal, when I finally do face it, will be lessened. I’ve heard this called tapering, but I’m not sure it fits the definition.

No one to be woken up in the middle of the night by officers to inform that their son has died with a needle in his arm or car wrapped around a tree. Those are the ones who can make poor choices and have only themselves affected by the consequences.

That was never the case. I remember being 17 and telling my parents from the jail on the pay phone that they shouldn't care. That it was my life to piss away if I wanted. And then have the nerve to ask them to bond me out. How naive I was. 

My father once asked me if I could would I take it all away. And I said no! I fucking said no. What a hardass I was. HA. I'd take it all back. I don't care about the possibility that it would be a thousand times worse. I'd roll the dice just for the chance to see my mother smile again. To take back everything I put her through. To be there for my brother and sister and be the role model that they needed. To give back the years I have taken off the lifespan of everyone I've come in contact with and that has had the displeasure of choosing/being forced to remain.

I chose to be the black sheep. To idolize and put dope fiends up on a pedestal. To blame it on a make believe disease and forfeit excuse after excuse. This is not disease. It's a choice we make each and every time we get the opportunity. I will no longer use some definition from a textbook as my cop out. From this day forward I will take responsibility for my actions . I will ask permission, not beg for forgiveness after the fact. I have to. Not just for me but for the people I care so deeply about. To prove to them that I am capable of more than just a black hole that sucks the happiness and joy and life force out every surrounding human being. It starts right now.",1443318087.0

This poses a problem for me as I have always used fake pee or someone else's clean pee. I don't know anyone that could provide urine with only buprenorphine in it. My options are totally clean or totally dirty piss. I think I have figured out a way around the test but I want to make sure this will work. 

The testing cup used in an Alere iCupdX 12 panel, with the expanded opiate panel. There is no bupe panel on the cup test. I am assuming soon there will be but until they run out of the current 12 panel cup tests they have, the then use an alere dipstick which screens for the buprenorphine. Here's my strategy: fill cup up with clean urine (the test is not monitored so this is easy). After filling the cup, put the lid on it and turn it on it's side so the testing panels on the lid can test the sample. Wait a couple of minutes in the bathroom until all 12 panels show negative for all metabolites being tested for. Take the lid off and add some more pee to the cup. This will be my piss, from my bladder so it will have heroin, oxymorphone, benzo's and marijuana metabolites in it as well as buprenorphine which i will take the day before the test. Since the bupe test is a single panel dipstick, it will obviously test positive for bupe. My main question is will the panels on the cap of the cup change when the dirty urine is added to the sample? Is that even possible or after their initial exposure to the specimen will it not matter that their is metabolites in the urine that would have been picked up by the 12 panels on the cap?",1443313410.0

They feel that the goal of these patients is to score a narcotic prescription and will go to great lengths in order to fulfill their need for drugs.  They see such encounters as a power struggle between the patient and themselves and worry about being manipulated or tricked, which would be embarrassing.

I personally believe that the number of such drug-seeking patients is lower than is popularly believed and many of these ""drug-seekers"" are really patients whose pain is inadequately treated.  People who are truly dependent on illicit opioids have tolerances that are tens to hundreds of times more than standard doses.  The guy taking 100 mg of heroin IV every eight hours is not going to get high on the twelve percocet 5/325's that I prescribed after draining his abscess.  Maybe he will sell them, but that's lot of work and waiting for less than $100 (I heard that they're worth ~$1/mg on the street).

With that in mind, when I treat patients for pain I rarely use my judgement of their intention for seeking pain relief.  I'd rather give 12 perco-snacks to an addict than deny them to someone in legitimate pain.   (That said, sometimes I will *increase* the starting dose for someone with a high tolerance, but it's hard to convince my nurses to push 30 mg of morphine or 500 mcg fentanyl IV even though it might be equivalent to 5 mg in person with no tolerance.)

So I want to pose some questions to actual people who are dependent on opioids.  Do you use the ED to score narcotics, either to sell or to get normal?  What is your relationship with your local ED?  

And one last one, which is a little off-topic.  Would you be open to alternative methods of acute pain relief?  I ask this last question because there are some very interesting developments in ED pain management that have been advanced in the last few years.  

The most exciting ones are sub-dissociative dosing of ketamine and regional nerve blocks (precision-targeted local anesthetic).  Some simpler techniques such as heat/cold, exercises, topical NSAIDs, steroid injections, and guided imagery are also gaining traction as many providers have shied away from opioids due to the large increase in deaths from narcotics, both illicit and prescribed.

What do you think is the average market up of your DOC? For every twenty dollars you spend, how much is it profit for you connect compared to covering expensive.

A kilo is 1000 grams (it's is easy to remember). If one kilo = 40,000 (saw this number thrown about on another thread), then a gram should be about 40 bucks. So, people buying grams for 60-80 are getting a mark up between 50 to 100 percent, more if it's the standard 100 bundle. Now that's if your lucky to buy from someone who gets keys. Say your guy pay 5000 for 100 grams; now 100 bundle is just 100% market up.  You the math.

It's a whole different game for pills. Market forces are pretty strong in play (if your H is bomb, someone will be willing to pay an extra 20 where as anything over a 1 per mg for blues is highway robbery). Average addition is is about 5 dollars, which is only 20-25% market up, way lowering than dope. It seems like most of the money is going to the person being prescribed the stuff (rightly so, since they are the one going without their meds, have bills, etc) and they know the price of their shit.

I took 8mg of suboxone (in 2mg increments yesterday). I had precipitated withdrawal for about 30 mins, it was so weird. I was drenched in sweat. Passed out & woke up ""okay""...but all day I felt so shitty, my back pain was unbearable, got goosebumps all day.

I took 20mg methadone today which helped a ton. I am not sick. 

I took some temazepam, abd for some reason it took like an hour to hit me, but right now I'm feeling fucking fantastic. Listening to some tunes.

I came across some Soma randomly. I don't think I will need it tonight, don't want to ask dying with all these downers going on in my system right now. However, I guess my question, has Soma helped you guys sleep when kicking, what does it feel like compared  to Benzos (which are my 2nd love in life).

*TL:DR below*


Timeline :
June 2014- 2mg Ativan as needed for about 6 months 
December 2014- 0.5mg Xanax from GP, 30 a week till March 2015

Start seeing Psychiatrist
March 2015- 1mg twice daily 
May 2015- 2mg twice daily 

September 2015- starting to ween me off, 
1mg three times daily 
1 week later- 1mg two times daily 

NOW: 
Anxiety starting to come back, he has me on a weekly prescription basis (ex: 1mg Alprazolam 3 times daily, DO NOT FILL TILL 9/27/15)

I was doing fine on the 2mg twice a day, some say that's too much but it was helping me tremendously. I do NOT want to go down to only 2mg TOTAL per day. 
I am having almost violent panic attacks, don't want to leave the house. Have no interest in friends or hanging out. 
Going through the 1mg x14 like a fiend. Usually lasts me 1-3 days if I'm smart with it. 
I don't abuse the drug or sell it however he is tapering me. 

*TL:DR - Doc dropped me from 120mg alprazolam a month to 60mg a month. Violently effecting me.*

What do I need to say? I'm already out from the ones filled this past Friday. These doctors must think I'm abusing it, however I take as prescribed and it's really fucked me up.(*Edit: I realize that this isn't how it's ""prescribed"", however it's what my body is used to and needs)* 
I have no problem taking Xanax, and it doesn't scare me. I DO NOT CARE what ""the outcomes"" of long term use is. I see it as long as they are making the drug, why can't I use what helps me be a person. 

Long story even shorter: 
""What do I tell my doctor?"" And ""How can I convince him to keep me at either 3mg a day or 4mg a day?"" Or ""Should I ask him for Clonazepam instead?""

Try to make this a short as possible. I've been fucking around with roxi's for quite some time now currently at about 210mg's per day I also drink almost every night. Lately I've been trying to cut back on pretty much everything as this addiction has ruined my life, financially,socially,sex etc.., and I'm honestly not even getting high anymore. I also suffer from SEVERE anxiety and panic attacks ... Like there's always a general anxiety with me and once or twice a week I get ""THE BIG ONE"" literally feel like I'm going to die ""THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT""...
Anywho last night I was drinking and took my normal dose of blues ... Maybe one extra. Also I really didn't hit the drinking that hard. I normally drink until I'm ready to pass out,eat a little something and go to sleep. Well, last night I stopped drinking a few hours before going to bed and instead was drinking water ... Like a lot of it... Like 8 water bottles,Idk why I was so thirsty. I then ate like 3 slices of pizza and was completely stuffed, to the point it felt uncomfortable. I don't shit as much as I used to on these things and as a result I have gained a lot of weight and my stomach always feels weirdly full... Last night was the most I'd ever felt it like that. So I of course I have a panic attack. Worried a it my heart rate,the fact that I'm nauseous, I suddenly start to equate my wanting to throw up with me having a ""heart attack""... (I had see in movies people throw up before having a heart attack... I think) So I don't throw up. Instead I eventually calm myself down and make my way to my room upstairs and go to sleep shortly after. I suddenly wake up because I feel liquid coming out of my nose ... IT WAS VOMIT ... It was in my mouth too! Thing is I didn't throw up on the bed and I didn't have to throw up after it was just ... Like an ""acid burp"". I ended up going right back to sleep and figured ""fuck it if it's going to happen again and I choke then I guess that's how it was meant to be ..."" I was sooo tired after that whole ordeal but the truth is I was scared shitless as I had never experienced anything like that. I've been scared as all hell today and being the junky alcoholic I am I still want to drink and watch MNF... 

Here's what's tripping me out though... I probably drank waaaaaaaayyyy  more than that on 1000's of nights and 7 30's isn't nowhere near the most I've ever done ... And I've ways been ok. Could I have died? Would my body have woke me up regardless seeing how I hadn't dosed or drank in like 7 hours at that point... Idk I know you're all going to tell me to see a doc.

Ate about 120mg throughout the night. And wow, it was a miracle. I was still a bit restless, uneasy, fatigued. But I had no tingly sensation making me want to rip off my skin or pace around my house or jerk my dick off til it was raw or hit and burn myself or put a bullet in between my eyes! Whenever I would start to feel it coming on, I would eat 6-10 more. Smoked a shit ton of weed after swallowing them. And I was actually able to lay in bed without tossing and turning. Amazing. 
Like I said, the RLS is the worst symptom for me. I would say loperamide alleviated 90% of my WDs. Funny tho, I took a shit 4 hours after eating 40mg. I still had the onslaught of sneezes here and there. Cold sweats and hot chills. Couldn't fall asleep until 5am after 2 blunts and 160mg. And the feeling of taking so much is a bit unpleasant at times.
But i fear Restless Leg Syndrome from my withdraws no more. I was doubtful at first, but loperamide should always be sitting in your medicine cabinet for emergencies.",1443477965.0

The alarm screams at me from the Darkness.  Alone with the dopesick beast gnawing on my nightmare.  A pale thing with holes and bruises.  Propped up nude, I look like scarecrow corpse with madman eyes.  

And my god follows me.  Every moment of my waking life he whispers:  

""You need me child.  I will give you the pleasures of the Gods.  Walk with the Night.  Know my Love.""

The first thing I do every morning is decide whether to shit or puke.  I keep a bucket by the toilet for moments when I can't decide.  One less dose has released the opiate binders in my intestines.  Emptying my guts from both ends always leaves me shaky as I prepare for work.  

Put on the Mask.  Pray the glue in the cracks holds for one more day.

I start the shower.  Purify the filth, cloak the death scent with soap.  Put on a happy face!  Only one bottle of shampoo in the shower.  I smile remembering things like Japanese Oatmeal Facial Scrub or Papaya Restoration Conditioner for Colored Hair...A woman's touch.  

It has been six years since I lived with a woman.

****

They invited 'just a few people' over.  People from Kym's work, some musician friends of Jason.  No big deal.  But people kept knocking.  Tired of opening the door every few minutes, they finally just left it open.  

And they kept coming.  

My brain is needed for this assignment and so why did I take Ari's LSD?  Jesus.  Did I really think it would make things easier?  And there is a storm churning out there...The intensity of merriment is whipping up like a cyclone of beasts.  The humming of drunken voices grows louder.  Last time I went out for a Pepsi and a piss, I watched strangers shuffle in carrying twelve packs of beer.  LSD makes me curious, so I stare.

""Oh hey man"" smiles a short skater-looking suburb kid.  ""Like uhm, Kym said there's a party here..?""

Behind me is a girl is being held upside down over a keg and sucks beer from the tap.  A crowd counts as her face grows red from gravity.  At 17 seconds, beer foams out her nose and she spews on our carpet.  The crowd cheers.  

I suppose there is a party.  

Back in my room Melo, Dev and three people I have never seen before have infiltrated my academic sanctuary.  The microwave is plugged in on the floor.  A coffee cup whirls within.  

""Hi Lover!"" chirps Dev with wide pupils and an extra happy grin.  ""We're making microwave crack.""

I nod.  

""Hello Dev.  Yes.  That seems like a good idea.""

""Dude"" nods Melo.

""Hi!  I'm Amy!  We met at Rondo's"" says a pleasant looking redhead with a pierced nose.  ""This is my boyfriend Jeff and this is Autumn!""

I look at them.  Flannels, boots, piercings.  Autumn wears a black Greek fishermen's cap.  Rustic versions of city kids.  Our Northern cousins.  I go back to my desk.  The LSD is starting to pulse through my core.  Though they sit less than four feet away I have not spoken.  I turn to them.  They all look up at me expectantly.  I struggle for something to say but the moment passes.  
  
I turn back to my book and hear Dev giggle.

Two things became apparent.  First, LSD is not a party drug.  Who are these people?  The one named Autumn seems to know me.  She asks about Jason but I got lost in her t-shirt.  A cow with a cigarette wears sunglasses.  It says, 'Cool as fuck.'  As I ponder this, Autumn pulls her flannel close.  I realize I'm staring at her chest.  

Mayan hieroglyphics spiral down from the ceiling on gossamer threads and it hits me like religion a moment before a violent death.  I am Enlightened.  I am the Chronicler on this night of drunkards and freebasing microwave crack smoking fiends...Then something smashes into the hallway causing peals of familiar laughter.

Oh yeah.  The second thing.  The second truth is Kym is wildly out of control.  

***
At work, no one likes me.  I am cloaked in a Serious Man disguise.  A humorless, office drone.  I will not high five you or accept your celebrity porn.  Years ago they stopped asking me to get drinks, meet their children or hang out after work.  Now they leave me alone.

I survive here by being high.  My 10am oxy and cocaine bullet in the bathroom keeps me even.  Oh and the 3pm one.  Sometimes the emergency 11am one too.  But as I withdrawal, my humorless side becomes palatable.  I fucking hate this place.  I fucking hate these assholes.  My mask slips a lot due to the extreme physical distress of opiate withdrawal.  I catch myself frowning a lot behind the cracks of my Mask.  

I stare at the spreadsheet that shows how to bleed a third world nation we operate a lawless enterprise in.  In column D are human beings far across the sea.  In my withdrawal pain I consign them to flames without further thought.  As cruelly calculated by Accounting, we just saved 1.4%.  

I am one of ten thousand slimy tentacles writhing on a dark beast miles below the Earth's crust.

Time passes slowly here.  I open another spreadsheet and wait to die.  It's almost lunchtime.  But no one will ask me to lunch.

******

When I hear Motley Crue's 'Kickstart My Heart' cranked up ridiculously loud I know Kym found the coke.  This song is a warning.

""Uh oh Kym found the coke"" cautions Melo looking up like he can sense a shift in the weather.

Dev rises from the circle of freebasing crack smokers.  Then she points at me and says, ""By the pricking of my thumbs!  Something wicked this way comes!""

BOOM! The door explodes open pouring the drunken roar of the party and Motley Crue inside.  Kym puts a finger to her lollipop purple lips and goes, ""Shhhh!  He's studying!""  

Then she laughs and stumbles inside.  Her followers peek into the room to see Kym's mysterious boyfriend.  Hunched over a pile of books with my mouth hanging open at Dev, I do not impress.  Kym stands there with one hand on her hip looking at me like I'm boring.    

""Whas the fucks wrong with you?"" slurs Kym as more random people pile in like lemmings.  ""Frying again?""

I smile.  I can hide tripping sometimes but not now.  Windowpane LSD is like walking around inside a cartoon.  Everyone is staring at me.  I'm an alien.  

Kym grabs my shirt and kisses me deeply fusing my dream world to her sexuality...I hear Dev explaining that we are her TV.  I wonder what that means...Kym slides into my lap.  Study time is over.  Smeared rainbows trail from her silver jewelry as she coke jabbers at me.  Water flows from the walls and stars twinkle in my peripheral vision.  

Tonight she wears black.  Tight black jeans, a Nirvana crop-shirt, black boots and dyed black hair coiled into two horns atop her head...I stare at the madness of her screaming blue eyes as she gossips about Jason.  Then she tilts her head like a bored predator deciding to end it now or have more fun?  She licks her lips and looks at me slyly.

""Do some coke with me babe.  Do it off my neck"" she smiles leaning back.  

I inhale her scent and the cocaine.  I lick her skin and drown in the ecstasy of her delights.

****

I'm choking on this damn day.  As I lick an envelope I gag and burp up bile.  Sweating and panting I hold onto my desk and fight the urge.  Calmly, I swallow it,  Not a great start to lunch.  

I crawl into my car.  I have a view of the some trash strewn across a hillside.  I set my phone to wake me in 30 minutes.  The morphine withdrawal makes me pass out almost instantly but I wake up ill.  Groaning, I open my car door and puke.  I open a Sprite, drink half and pour the rest over my puke and pass out again.

When I wake up, I take an oxy.  Sorry taper.   Not sticking with my plan.  But since I'm starved, dehydrated and dying, I get a nice buzz.  I almost feel normal when I walk back in.  The manager that accuses me of stalling projects (100% true) sees me and nods.  I nod back.  Earlier I would have scowled.  Chalk one up for prescription drug abuse.  

I crawl through my day.  The pill buzz is brief.  The last two hours pass like gut wound murder.  But I'm watched.  I work the full 8 hours to justify my keep.  As I leave, no one speaks.

My heart has been beating wrong.  Like a caged fish flopping in my bones.  I gasp, swoon and keep moving.  Outside the sun burns so hot I could just lay down on the asphalt and die.

****

""Kiiickstaaart myyyy heeeaaaaarttt"" groans Kym dramatically as the song ends.  Loud bass music begins and the walls vibrate as Kym drops to the floor giggling.

I stand up to get my smokes when she suddenly grabs my leg and pulls me to the floor.  People yank up their drinks and scatter as she roars and tries to pin me.  When she bites my chest I yell and kick over the bong.  She straddles me so I grab the coke, yank her shirt down and do a bump off her chest.  She laughs, grabs my head and sways rhythmically to the Geto Boys.  

She snorts bumps off my stomach and licks me as I stare at the gossamer stalagmites that drip crystal butterflies over me.  Kym's head whips up in a deranged cocaine glow as she howls maniacally.  Her eyes are peeled wide open like twin, exploding stars.  I reach to stroke her face but she jumps up.

""Shots!  Let's do some whiskey shots babe!""

Kym drags me out as more people stumble in to freebase Dev's microwave crack.  Our house is packed.  I feel otherworldly weird weaving through the crowd.  

""Bye-bye Lover!"" yells Dev as I trail my love star into the storm.  

I am instantly surrounded by people and every single one of them is smiling.  

****

I spend my days alone.  At work I am surrounded by people I loathe.  I live in a crowded apartment complex with hundreds of people I don't know.  

Driving home, it hits me.  I'm starving.  I pull into a Taco Bell.  The young, black girl that serves me smiles professionally.  Like a lonely freak, I take her smile back to my table to ponder.  So few smiles in my life.  I wonder what it would be like to hold her dark skin in my pale arms?  I actually feel lust.  My penis still works.  
 
I enter traffic and crawl down the El Camino past the stores that all look the same.  So many people here.  All dressed blandly in khaki, casual office wear.  And I look like every other motherfucker.  But appearances can be deceiving.  My track marks, black bags under my eyes and the 1000 yard stare show I am the weakest creature in the herd.  The one that will be picked off first by wolves.  But no one cares.  No one notices.    

If I didn't get haircuts or go to the doctor I could avoid human contact for years in this strip mall town.
 
***

""There he is!"" yells Jason who lunges through a throng of people to grab my hand and hug me.  Bear crushing hugs are his specialty and he lifts me off the ground like we haven't seen each other for months.  We actually ate dinner at Tacos El Unico when I dropped the acid.

It is a lovely thing being young and stupid.  There are over a 100 people in a two bedroom flat.  I sense the storm is raging slightly out of control but who cares?  It all swirls together in a melting loop of cartoon madness as I tether my brain to three anchors for sanity.  

My first anchor is Dev.  She tells me everything is alright.  I love Dev and believe anything she says when I'm dosed.  Tonight everything is gonna be alright.

Jason is another one.  He circulates and makes everyone feel awesome.  Three random Mexican guys that can't speak English followed the noise from the street into our house and Jason gave them beer.  That is so Jason.  Plus I bet he dropped at least $200-$300 bucks on the booze and pizzas that keep appearing as the night rolls on.  

My last anchor is Kym.  She is dancing which is witchcraft when you are that beautiful.  Her spell releases people from their lives so they are free.  In my LSD eye I watch her transform them to music.  No sense of self as they descend into her madness and follow the Maenad.  Howling and crazed they move like the world is burning.  Men and women surround her but I barely feel jealousy anymore.  They are part of her world.  Playthings.  She weaves through them laughing.  

Plus Kym publicly claims me with sloppy, overtly sexual displays of affection.  These embarrass the hell out of me but make me realize I am one her anchors.  A tether back to the world that lets her freely turn from flesh to energy without worrying about repercussion.  

She knows I will catch her.

****

End of the day.  My present to myself for going to work is heroin.  A foil bead tribute to the Dragon god.  I need to jump off the smack.  I need to get more pills but they are so light and feathery in their touch.  A flirting sensation that flees quickly from my weary mind...With fire I chase the Dragon across the silvery plain.

As I hold in the smoke I can hear my neighbors.  They exercise after work, eat at meal times and rear two small children.  They have goals and dreams and go places on the weekends.  

Fuck them.

I am alone.  Peanut butter toast is dinner and I'm counting pills for my evening taper.  I put them in a bag and lock the bottle in a safe.  TV bores me.  Too twitchy to read as the Dragon leaves the room.  He is winding through the furniture and slips through the window.  He takes my message to the Flower God.  

I miss you.

*****

Jason has his arm around that girl Autumn.  Kym is messing with the stereo.  Dev materializes in front of me.  She is so tiny.  Without a word she suddenly hugs me fiercely.  I freeze as I am not a hugger.  But I melt into her small embrace.  I can feel her energy and it feels good.  She releases me and smiles.

""For your next life"" Dev says as loud jangly guitar sounds fill the room.

Everyone here knows this song.  My roommates play it over and over and it fills them with energy to get crazier and crazier.  With his arm still around Autumn Jason spits beer into the air and drags her into the room while yelling along with the song, ""That's the way it GOES!  This city is so COLD!""

And people start howling along and jumping up and down while screaming the chorus, ""Baby I'm born to loooose!""  

I can feel the old house shaking under the dreadful stomp of hundreds of boots.  It feels like they could bring it down as they howl and scream along to the song.  And fuck, it's good be alive.

**********

I wake up at my dining room table.  Seven empty beer bottles and half empty pint of Jack Daniels greet me.  I look at the clock.  Only 9:20pm.  Shit.  So many more hours until my alarm.  I feel like I'm gonna be sick so I check what's left in my taper bag.  Empty.  

Gone.  Like me.  I don't feel high.  I just feel like I can puke.  The doctor said I'd die if I keep this up.

I wonder when?

Well, very soon I have a doctor's appointment. It's my first time seeing this guy. A few of my friends have this guy and get HUGE scripts (yeah, I think that he's a croaker) but I digress... Anyhow, their scripts are for, say, 90 percs, 120 Adderall 30s, and 60 Xanax bars. That's a ""typical"" script. I have a friend who sees him also who gets her 8/2 bupes from him, 60mg Adderall/dy, and 60 1mg Xanax.

Here's the thing: I have been on 3mg of Xanax per day for almost 15 years now. It has been both licitly and illicitly obtained. The last prescription that I had for it (3mgs) was about 3 years ago. Since then, I've been getting them from the DNMs.

I am also on methadone, 80mg/day. This is through a clinic and is legit. I have 2x/mo carries as I always piss clean (they don't test for THC nor benzos). In fact, the CLINIC were the ones that got me addicted to the Xanax in the first place! They had me on 100mg/dy, 6mgs Xanax/dy, AND 60mg diazepam/dy. Yeah, I know, I played them--but still, that could have killed me! Never came close though.

In the by and by, the doc that wrote for the benzos resigned and they ""tapered"" me off. At three mgs I saw a shrink, DID NOT mention the methadone, and got a script for 3mg/day (and Cymbalta, which, of course, didn't get filled). This dude died, hence I started acquiring them illicitly.

OK, if you were me what would YOU say to a doctor that, if he's not TOTALLY freaked as it is, WILL most likely write? I am NOT interested in opis as the 'done holds me just fine. Only the Xanax. I DO want to quit the shit someday though!

What do you think I should say? Where to start? Should I mention that I was looking into the Ashton Method (sloooowly moving over to diazepam and tapering from that over 2-3 years) and ask him if he'll help me end the Xanax by tapering me according to the Ashton Method?

Keep in mind that, as I said, I DO want to get off of the Xanax!! I just know that it's going to take a LOOONG time, and I WON'T cheat.

Should I even mention the methadone?? This guy does NOT test.

How would you handle this pickle my fellow friends?

I REALLY appreciate your advice--anything you can help with is VERY appreciated!

Just need some cool people to talk to.","Investigate been on disability since I was 12 for depression and bipolar disorder. That's how I'll start off. Okay, so that's one thing. Anyway, because of said depression (which mostly stems from loneliness, but whatever), I still live with my mom and dad. Guys, I don't even know how to drive and some days I'm so depressed I can't shower for like a week and can barely move.

Anyway, about a year ago, they cut my check out. For no real reason. The letter basically said ""we don't care that you're depressed, you can still work"". Bull fucking shit. So, I went through a process of trying to get my check back. On 9-03 of this year, I saw this guy for an evaluation and he was a real dick. I made the mistake of being honest and admitting to opiate usage. So, recently, I was denied. We have 60 days to appeal it. Fuck.

How I started using: I have legitimate pain. Something is wrong with my left hand, back and knees. My mom started giving me her Lortab 10s (really nice yellow ones sort of shaped like footballs). This was around 2009/2010, after I graduated high school. Then, not too long after that, my dad was going to a Doctor and getting Opanas. The pain in my left hand started getting worse, so my dad would give me those. Man, I loved the Opana 10mg IRs. Best pain pill ever, IMO.

But, unfortunately, he got dropped. He was going through WDs so bad he was about to shoot himself with his SKS, but instead he made the smarter decision to trade it for 10 Roxy 30s so he didn't end up doing that. I know one day he shot it inside the house. He said he aimed it at the roof, but we never found the bullet hole. Weird, huh? It was so loud and it freaked me the fuck out. I was scared he had actually done it, but no he hadn't.

Anyway, we went through various periods of taking different drugs which was always influenced by what's *available*. For the past three or so years, only Subutex has been available so that's what we take.

The last time I had tex was Monday, and the girl we got it from wanted a piece. My dad usually cuts the pill, but he had mom do it and she cut this girl a huge piece, like basically a third. So I doubt the piece I had was even a quarter. So, here I am WD'ing and hoping like hell that when mom or dad go to check the ATM today, mom's money is in there. Because sometimes it comes early.

I'm an atheist, but I'm almost considering asking you guys to pray that it's in there lol

Despite all the shit I go through during WDs, I am proud of being a pain pill user and I will not take shit for it. I've had to take shit for it from one of my best friends and my own sister. I'm in pain and I need them, end of story. Plus, the buzz? Heaven. Especially Opana...

Anyway, I just needed to vent, if that's okay. 

Edit: Just for fun, I did some math on my DC Comics collection, and I probably spent about $782.77 on it with tax, yet I have probably spent maybe three times that much on pills since I started using. No ragrets with either one. I love DC and I love pills.

Edit 2: Money came today, got Subutex. But, see, tex works weird for me. I have to sleep, then take it as soon as I wake up, or else I don't get any euphoria or pain fighting effects from it. So, I want to bed at about three in the afternoon and woke up at about 10 at night, just about 45 minutes ago. Not feeling anything today. Hoping it just takes awhile for the buzz to kick in. Sometimes, smoking tobacco helps kick it in and I'm about to do that. Something is strange with my eyes, has been since I woke up. Like I can't focus on anything.",1443617613.0

I just wanted to talk and discuss the differences in ECP and BTH. I personally live on both coasts currently (spending most of my time in the West, however) so I get to experience both. 



**My short history:** Started at 14 with hydros/weed/booze, 16 percs/xanax/more booze and weed/Ex/some other pharms, 19 smoking Heroin, 19.5 shooting Heroin(and Acid. Didn't help with my addiction lol). TBH I don't even remember 100% if I shot ECP or BTH first. Pretty sure it was, started smoking BTH, came back to East, started shooting ECP.

All of this is just my opinion, personal experiences, etc. I mean, there may be some facts thrown in there but i'm not saying that this is all 100% true info 100% of the time for everybody. Just my experiences over the years.

**ECP:**


**Summary:** ECP stands for East Coast Powder, aka China White, aka Heroin. Most of the time it comes in Bundles, anywhere from 7-14 little wax packages that typically have 0.1g of heroin inside of them. From my experiences, 99% of the time it was a gram/slightly under a gram divided into 10 wax baggies/packages. From my understanding this varies by location. ECP may also come in a ""rocky"" form. This is far more typically seen when either buying to a dealer you know more than a street guy, and/or you're buying more than a bundle or two. ECP can be anything from white, to a concrete type grey, to more typically being a light/medium shade of brown. It's rarely if ever true hazel/dark brown.

**Pros:**   Usually strong as shit. Again, depends on your connect/area, but i've found as long as you have a consistent guy that either cops it himself from a big city/port or has a friend that does, then that stuff will be fire. It's going through far less people than a random street/cold cop, which also means less adulterants.

It's also easy to prep. No ""cooking"" of anything, no flame or heat needed, mixes easy as hell, easy to measure out due to baggies more or less being close to the same amount. Super easy to snort too, literally just chop it up a little bit and rail it. However, there is a ""strategy"" to snorting ECP. You can't just rail it and go to town like cocaine. You want to take little bumps at a time, and switch nostrils each time. It helps if they're wet on the inside. You want all of it to go in via your nose otherwise it will just go to the back of your throat and go in your stomach, which is a waste. Hence why you take small bumps switching nostils, so it gives the heroin time to disolve into your nose.

Compared to BTH and many other things, it's really not that bad on your veins. Unless your stuff is cut with bad things, or you use the same vein over and over again (Yes, switch veins, as much as possible! I only shoot in the same vein twice before switching!)

I'm sure there are more pro's, but i'm A. very tired B. want other people to contribute!

**Cons:**  It can be cut with anything and you wouldn't know half the time. Now this is true for tons of drugs, but it's especially easy to hide pretty much any cut that isn't super crystaly in with ECP. Sometimes, it's not too bad, they just cut it with powdered Morphine. Sucks that you're getting less of a high, but what can you do, it's not arsenic. It can also be cut with Fentanyl (can someone explain this to me? How the fuck do they get powdered fentanyl, how the fuck is it cheaper than Heroin/cheap enough to cut a LOT of heroin with, and why did they choose Fent of all things?) which is bad in the sense of if you shoot too much, you pretty much die. A lot easier than if it was just your heroin or even heroin with morphine. From my understanding, it's highly sedative, and this combined with it being a suuuuper strong opiate can lead to a half gram + day user of heroin can OD off their normal dose if it contains enough Fentanyl. Not cool. Worst case, it's cut with some real bad shit that fucks up your veins or nose after using it like, twice. Thank the Lord that I have never gotten stuff that was cut to oblivion or cut with anything especially bad(I think I got some fent-cut bags a few times though), but it's a major deal with ECP.


From my general understanding, heroin on the east coast is near-epidemic levels. So, take this with a grain of salt + my little experience, but I think it's easier to get caught with it in the East. Simply because it's more popular there, more and more suburban/""normal"" people are doing it, so unless you have a super lowkey or rich dealer you typically gotta go to the hood to cop. Or meet in a parking lot or something. Cops look out for this shit all the time. I was scared shitless when I had to pick up a middleman at like 2pm in the hood and bring her to go cop(again, in the hood, this time in an area where theres more cops in general, literally 2 blocks north of the major police station for the part of the city). Now, I don't mean that cops on the west coast don't look for it or that its easy to get away with on the west, but BTH on the West Coast is used much less on average than ECP is in the East.

Again, personal experience, but I think and AFAIK it's a bit easier to OD and sometimes die with ECP than BTH. I find ECP a good bit stronger, and if thats combined with the Fent it sometimes is, it can catch someone who doesn't know off guard. I've shot .7 of raw BTH before(while I usually use .5-1g a day/day and a half split over 2-4 times) and not even come close to ODing, only nodding out a lil bit. When using ECP, I would use 3 bags each shot, usually twice a day, and 4 bags the next AM, or save one bag from each bund for another time. However, the first time I got the Fent-mixed bags, I did 3 shots(my first shot that day) and 100% almost OD'd. I was out for a few minutes and I had puked on myself. I was home alone. If I hadn't woken up right after I puked(I could tell ti was like, 30 seconds prior that I puked, I think I was slightly sentient at that point for it). It literally knocked me on my ass, never had that happen to me, ever.


**BTH:**


**Summary:** BTH, or Black Tar Heroin, is a form of Heroin that's typically from South America. It's name describes it somewhat well. It can range from medium brown(aka poop-when-its-a-little-lighter-color-than-normal-brown), to slightly darker brown. I have only seen BTH actually be truly black twice. Once the stuff was great, second time was the most cut shit I ever had, resulting in next to no high. While they are both heroin, I think that BTH and ECP has a different chemical makeup. Some smarty pants in the comments would have to elaborate on this. BTH can either be fairly solid or more soft/malleable. Sometimes it's even slightly ""gooey"", but this is usually when it's warm. It's more rare, but I have gotten ""powdered"" BTH before. It was a slightly darker than normal tan color. It was a gram and came in 2 decent size chunks(they looked like a tan powdered donut hole, but smaller), with this tan powder and much smaller pieces surrounding. However, when exposed to heat(Hot breath for a minute, put into spoon with water/cooked, etc) it turned into a deep slightly dark brown color. So, there are quite a few forms of BTH. A telltale way to tell if you got BTH or a chunk of chocolate is smelling it. It should have a slightly vinegary smell, or a slightly BBQ/chocolately smell. It has its own unique smell, usually varying a bit between types, but if you've smelled BTH a few times, you'll always know what it smells like.


**Pros:**  You can use it any way you like. Shit, you can even vape it (never did in a hand held vape, but I have on a vape-nail thing in a bong) The most popular are shooting it and smoking it. It's also pretty easy to plug. It's a bit harder to snort, but not impossible. You have to break it down into a powder as much as you can(hard if its the gooey-stickey stuff) and mix it with something like a bit of powdered Lactose. For every gram of BTH, you would probably want/need .3 - .5 of lactose. Smoking it is super easy, you just plop a peice down on foil and inhale with a straw while following it. One of those things thats ""easy to do, hard to master"". Really gotta go slow your first few times or you'll be getting like 40% of what you're burning. Shooting(and plugging) are harder. You gotta cook the BTH in the spoon or whatever you use, and it can be tricky. Basically you put your amount(I do .4, if you're just starting out i'd say stick to .2 or .3, really depends on the quality of the stuff) in your spoon/cooker and add water. Then you hold the lighter or candle or whatever below it(use the tip of the flame, just barely touching the bottom of the spoon) to the bottom. You want it to start SLIGHTLY bubbling. Like the tiniest amount of bubbling. You should see the BTH starting to melt, thats perfect. If its bubbling like boiling water or even close to it, from what I know, you're wasting some of your opiates. It's hard to describe with words...you just want to make sure the water is hot enough, but not really bubbling. Its okay to take it slow. 

it's much harder to cut, leading to, well less people cutting it! To cut BTH, you either gotta do it at the source, or know one of the only couple ways to cut it. And even then, it's not the easiest thing to do. And again, theres only a few things to cut it with without fucking it up or making it super obvious. So, it probably gets cut once-3 times max before it reaches you. And (afaik) they can't (or wont) cut it with fent or morphine means they can't make it 15% heroin and get away with it.


**Cons:**   It's weaker. Not by a TON & I'm not sure if this is scientific fact or just ""junkie science"". I am 100% sure when it comes to me getting high, .3 of solid ECP will get me higher than .3 of BTH. .3 - .4 of good ECP will make me slightly nod, while it would take at least .6-.8 of solid BTH to make me nod. For some reason the different chemical makeup or whatever compcared to ECP is just weaker.


harder to find/buy. Again, this may be a location thing or whatnot, but from what I know and understand BTH isn't as popular on the west coast as ECP is popular on the east coast. This means less hoods with junkies, less hustlers on the corner(with black on deck, at least), less people to find that you can get a connect from, etc. California I think its an exception to this, it's pretty damn popular there. But I think California has a large drug culture overall, both ""soft"" and ""hard"". But at least in a certain subreddit here(PM me for details), less people over a greater amount of area(west coast) post less about it than people on the east coast that post about it, which in the main areas is much smaller than the west. That large strip/area of Philly/Middle and North NJ/NYC/DC/Boston is basically the worlds heroin central, and it all flows out of that area to anywhere in driving distance. And i've lived in a few places both east and west coast. I just found it overall harder to find dealers and even people that use on the west coast. This is in both cities and suburbs. There are a few areas in a few big major cities on the west coast that are known as ""heroin spots"" but there are far far more of those on the east coast. On the west coast there are these fabled ""mexican drivers"" with the best stuff straight for mexico, they're always on time, 7 days a week, from like 8am-7pm. However, finding one of these is a BITCH. You gotta know someone that knows someone, or do like I did lol.... I literally asked a hooker from backpage and she middlemanned for me for a while. Was cool, only charged me $5 each time(besides the first but whatever thats expected) and all I did was literally pick her up, drive 8-10 minutes, give her the money, she goes in the car with the mexican, gives me the stuff, boom 10 minutes bring her back. And shit was like, $60 or maybe $80 tops a gram. It really was amazing until one day she got in my car in shorts and had a HUGE gross nasty ass cyst on her thigh that looked like it had a 80% chance to pop in my car. Thank God it didn't. A week or so later her phone went dead for a few weeks so there went that connect lol.

It's only a minor ""con"" but it can be annoying having to heat up the H before being able to shoot it. If you have no lighter, candle or stove you're pretty much fucked until you have access. It also makes shooting up in a car far more risky. It's a 1-3 minute addition to a process that most if not all of us want to go as quick as possible anyway lol

Again, i'm sure theres more pros and cons to BTH, but i'd like to hear them from you!


For those that have done both, some starter questions. If you start to talk about the stuff this will be informative to add!:

Which do you prefer, and why? What's your typical dose of each? Where do you currently live(general area, don't have to say the city. State would be nice but not 100% needed. Don't source in this thread please, it's against the rules! PM's are your friend!) What is your most used/preferred method of using? How long have you been using?

Back when before Florida had prescription Monitoring programs and still had pill mills. Back when Oxy 30s used to go for $10 each. I believe the time I am talking about was between 06 and 10. I just want to hear what it was like we're pills used even more common back then? I remember when I started I had no idea what I was getting involved in buying 30s for 10-15 dollars each my senior year of hs in 2011. 

I just wanted to hear what this time was like for people who were older and got to experience this for a longer time. I only briefly saw them this cheap after I graduated they then seemed to go up 5-10 dollars each year after that. They hit 30 a 30 in the suburbs of Philly about a year or 2 ago. I'm lucky if I can get 280 for 10. Dealers have no reason to do price drops because supply is so fixed. Also I've never seen any other pills than 30s. I've never seen 80s cause once they switched everyone gave up on them I guess. I've never seen any morphone derivatives either, only codeine not sure why. I want to hear stories of the good old days that supply was near limitless because one could go see a different dr almost everyday getting a new script to sell and put on the street. 

Also I am curious about why people did dope during this time? I'm sure it was still cheaper but at least you had consistent product for maybe only slightly more maybe double the price. Versus today I am a herion addict (sniffer non-IV user) and I buy 5 dollar bags that get me as well as doing a 30. I would be willing to pay double for constant product that also doesn't have the stigma of heroin. But paying 6 times the price is insane these days. If people wanted a rush wasn't it easy to get dillies or opanas to shoot? ",1443588106.0

this post is called ""still 'live with trash can"" because /u/heroinking is still alive. details to follow. if you just want to skip to the picture, [here it is](http://imgur.com/R0NE5NX).

so, we got a call from one of our best clients who has become a friend, and he'd like us to come by his hotel and stay up doing meth with him all night. no problem with that, right? we'd managed to save some money so we try to get some white before we go over there, but no dice apparently. guess it doesn't snow in the first week of fall. we take the car, which was loaned to us solely on the promise that we'd be bringing back some boy when we came home that night.  

after stopping for some chicken on the way to put my dick in, we pull up to the hotel all greasy fingered and grouchy. to be honest, things had been a little rough lately and neither of us were sure why. we'd been at each other's throats for a couple weeks, but you gotta put that shit aside in order to get the job done and get high, so we visit our dude, smoke a bunch of meth, shoot the shit, shoot a load (ok, so i lied about the gay sex) and then we head home. on the spur of the moment, we decide to ask our friend if we can buy a bit o' meth to take with us. i've smoked it before, snorted it once (BAD FUCKING IDEA) but never done enough of a shot for it to make a difference. so, meth. meh. or so i thought.

lo and behold, our d-boy is up at 6am!! we pick up a half gram and thankfully its his better shit. do a shot, turn around and go home. 

well, we stop to get some gas, and hk cleans out the car some and we drive off. getting home, we decide to do a little more in the car before we go in.

eis: hon. where's the dope?  
hk:in my bag  
eis:no......yeah, no  
hk:maybe i left it in the car  

CUE [YAKKETY SAX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnHmskwqCCQ) WHILE HIGH SPEED FILM OF TWO JUNKIES DESTROYING A CAR PLAYS  

eis:motherfuck. did you throw it away when you cleaned out the fucking car?  
hk: uhhhhhh.....  
eis:holy shit  

CUE [SACRED POWER OF RAGING WINDS](https://youtu.be/DM6hL78so9c?t=35s) AS JUNKIES LEAP INTO CAR AND HEROICALLY RACE BACK TO THE CIRCLE K

I grab the steering wheel in my white knuckled hands and tell myself ""ok. it's going to be ok. it'll be right there on the ground next to where the car was, and it's 6am on a sunday morning, no one will have been there yet. this will be fine. hk probably had it in his lap or something when he stood up to go pay, and i'm sure it's still there."" i slow down before hitting the driveway to make sure that we don't catch air going over the entrance to the gas station parking lot. pulling up to the pump opposite the site of the crime against drugs, we scour the ground, the area, test the windspeed and determine it's about a steady 5mph originating in the east, and as I am trying to calculate how far a small bag weighing .6 of a gram might go with that sort of wind should it even be picked up, i think, fuck.

eis: hk, what about the trash can.  could you have THROWN IT AWAY? (upon saying these words I start to think about blood for some reason. lots of blood. pretty, bright red blood. i always wanted a red living room.)
hk: gimme the flashlight, i'll look.

so, hk has his face and entire right arm in the trash can, looking for this tiny half gram and digging through all the shit he threw away. i point out that there's some more of our shit a bit farther down and he moves a pack of cigarettes (empty, obviously: we checked) and eureka!  

hk pulls it out of the trash can. for some reason he hadn't tied the bag before putting it wherever the fuck he put it before he THREW AWAY OUR GODDAMNED HEROIN. my heart leapt in my chest. and before i leapt for his lovely throat, i had the presence of mind to ask, ""did we lose much?""

""actually no, it's pretty much all there.

CUE [CECILA](https://youtu.be/a5_QV97eYqM?t=1m54s)

Jubilation! I love him again. laughing with delight, i ask him to pose next to the trash can which was [the scene of our triumph and the source of our redemption](http://imgur.com/R0NE5NX). i don't even want to know how pissed the girls would have been if we came home dopeless and all fuckered up on meth with nothing but a half gram of meth to show for it. especially since we weren't planning on showing shit, lol.

now, meth. i've always thought badly of meth. i am a snob, after all: i expect the highest quality  or best experience in food, music, cleanliness, service, clothing, and my snobbery goes punk rock when it comes to traveling, sleeping in places not my home--i prefer to couch surf or use youth hostels--, rock and roll, and other shit like that. Basically, for stuff I can't usually get for free, I'm a gutter snob. If it's not the cheapest, most grimy way of doing it, I ain't having none of it. My snobbery extends to my drug use as well, however. Now heroin, that's a drug with some class. you think of heroin, you think of billie holiday, lou reed, nico, tony bourdain, kurt cobain (this actually almost puts me off of it), kim deal, the cool kids club basically. when you think of meth, you think of that lady with three teeth the color of spring butter, a smoker's growl, and a funny limp who works third shift at the waffle house. i never wanted to try it really. i don't usually care for uppers, and i have ADD anyway so it doesn't do much for me high-wise. i tried a small shot before driving home from the hotel and it was decent. got a good feeling, everything was sort of...wobbly for a few seconds, and then brighter and more colorful. nice. i'll try a bigger one next time.

so, once at home after all the shit with the discarded heroin (jesus christ /u/heroinking, i think you just abdicated your throne) we settle in and i do a good sized shot (for me, i'm a small guy and uppers hit me hard). the difference is amazing. i can smoke it all night and never feel more than a little kinder and more sociable. this was next level shit. i've never been that happy in my goddamn life. and feeling someone touch you is unreal. i can see how people throw their lives away on this shit, too, now. i'll never judge another drug user again. unless they just smoke it, that's fucking weak.

edit: removed the twatty preface, because it was twatty. i can see how that'd be objectionable, but i don't really edit things or think things through before i post, so there you go. preserved here, because i'm not the kind of person who hides my idiocy.  

Twatty preface:  
 if you don't like me, don't read this because it's about me. or you can post a nasty comment and look like an idiot, since that's what an idiot would do because i'm not going anywhere, despite what you and your 8 throwaway accounts might think.

I'm in school currently, and I've never been so lazy about my current ""obligations"" like I am now. Like many others, I don't have goals, ambitions, dreams, etc. I'm mostly sober and know that I shouldn't turn to drugs, especially opiates, because they'll probably seem to fix everything only temporarily. I assume that a lot of people develop addiction when in a similar situation to mine. So I ask for your experiences and general advice in helping me stay away from opioids. Knowing me I probably won't take it because I'm young and stupid and don't know hardship. But I can't/won't talk to anyone I know about this as it feels too shameful. There is a dull terror that I feel about the future because at this rate it doesn't look great, but at the same time I just feel this overwhelming sense of apathy.

We have been doing the long distance thing, so I haven't been able to be there all the time with him to help him if he needed it. His family doesn't know, and I'm one of the very few people who have stuck around for him after coming clean to his friends. But I have been completely supportive of him and his decisions. I just made it clear that I didn't want him to lie to me or keep his use from me.

Unfortunately, he has lied constantly to me for this past year. Even though I have witnessed him smoke, gone to pick some up with him, and even separated the heroin into portions to help him wean off, he still chooses to lie to me. 

I've caught him in a lie around 6-7 times now, and we've had the same conversation each time. I explain to him that I love him even with his addiction, but I don't want to be lied to anymore. It has gotten to the point where I don't think I'll ever trust him again. And being in a relationship where there is no trust doesn't seem like a healthy relationship to me.

Even though I was addicted to crack for two years, I, myself, am NOT an opiate user. So I know that I will never be able to fully understand what he's going through each time he decides to get clean. He says that he lies and hides things from me because he doesn't want to disappoint me, but I just wish he understood that he doesn't disappoint me when he relapses. He disappoints me when he hides it from me. 

He told me about his addiction before we started dating, so I knew what I was getting myself into. I just didn't think there'd be so much lying....

So to sum this up, I am asking for advice from the Reddit community. After a whole year, I feel hopeless. I want to know where he's coming from. But I just get so frustrated whenever he lies to me.
