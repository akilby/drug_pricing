on 8/29 i picked up 2 years clean and sober from drugs and alcohol.

my addiction took me all across the United States, it took my dreams and passions away from me. 

in 2009 i was enrolled at a good New England college, doing relatively well, and by 2013 i was homeless on the streets of NYC, flying a sign, slowly destroying myself.

after getting sober, i had to start from the ground up. i had a felony fugitive warrant from across the country, i got extradited at 5 months clean. when i bonded out of jail across the country, i was homeless for a few days trying to get a bed at a halfway house. 

today i am a productive member of society, i am a valued employee, i am in school again, i have a loving relationship with a beautiful girl, i have friends who show love and compassion and concern and are there to help me and i them. 

i dont completely know what my point is here, i guess first off i would just like to thank you all. i love this community, there was a time when the interaction here was the only interaction i had with others, aside from the dope man. i am a huge advocate of harm reduction / addiction awareness, and this community was very helpful to me in keeping safe and aware of the danger of dope that was going around when i stopped.

i love you all. please stay safe, and if you ever tire of using, know that you can and will change your life if you put a little effort in. i am always willing to chat with someone, so please reach out.

all these drugs have been legally prescribed i guess i should mention. i have dabbled in amphetamines a bit and the biggest hit for me was when i stopped taking them about a month and a half ago. but i think cutting down opiates is hitting my energy levels harder. i dont take opiates to relax, they energize me. i suppose thats weird but i never liked taking large amounts that are enough to nod off unless i couldn't fall asleep, and instead I'd usually take a benzo or modified GABA like sonata/ambien,etc.. So..is it opiate withdrawal fucking with me or is it amphetamine? 

the last thing I should mention is that since I ran out of adderall IRs, I got prescribed 60mg vyvanses. i empty them in gatorade like I did today, and shake it up. then consume only part of the drink..ez way to partially dose since the doc gave me what I can only assume to be a larger dose than I really want to take.

But Vyvanse is a shitty answer to a permanent energy problem. So..am I reliant on Vyvanse from taking it so sparingly? Literally like 1x a week?? Or is this slight opiate weaning really causing my apathy?

And yeah..sorry to all the veterans and the ""real"" junkies..I know I dont IV and I don't get super high..I mainly got into opes because of a chronic pain issue..so I'm not even really able to enjoy em as much as ""come up for air, in a sea of pain.""

How ironic I was to be the biggest addict of them all. 

It mostly all started when I broke my arm, and got prescribed oxy. Damn, I was hooked instantly. Smoking while high was fantastic, so I started that as well. Only problem was that my prescription wasn't renewed after the cast went off. I was back on earth - for now. 

A few years later, I was halfway through nursing school. We had these pre-filled syringes with Morphine that, according to local routines, were kept for a maximum of 24 hours after being drawn up. After that, toss them in the bin. Weeeelllll, let's just say many of those got squirted out under my belly fat. Hooked once again. 

This has continued ever since. The amount of medication thrown away is fantastic. I rationalize it away as not stealing, since it's basically trash that is to be destroyed. We're legally not allowed to re-use patient-bound medicine that's been paid for by them. 
I have my code to never steal from (live) patients, never get high at work and no trackmarks on my arms. Haven't been suspected for 5+ years.

Right now, amongst others, I work at a end-of-life-care facility. Didn't believe my luck at first when I read that routine was for us nursing staff to take care of and send a passed patients medication, especially the narcotic ones, to the pharmacy. We'd have these big black plastic bags we put everything in, and of course nobody in their right mind would go through those once everything's been tossed in. There's a lot of good shit in those bags.

This weeks score so far has been 5 vials of dilaudid 10mg/ml , 6 vials of morphine sulphate 10mg/ml, 10 vials of versed 5mg/ml, 50-ish morphine 10mg, 100 oxycodone capsules 10mg, some Xanax and oxazepam and a couple of patches. And I've been picky about what I brought home.... :'D

Given the difficulty of acquiring and the price of oxycodone I was going to go hard yesterday. Was my first time really ingesting any meaningful amount of oxycodone and I took 20mg doses throughout the day. I was pretty high with good euphoria most of the day but once it got to around 8pm; had had like 70mg oxy I decided to do 300mg codeine to try and get reallyyyy high. I followed it up with 40mg oxy in two doses two hours apart but after the point where I did the codeine the euphoria seemed to wane gradually with only increases in sedation given by the later doses of codeine and oxycodone. This was rather disappointing. I have a bit left and will be doing it with friends next week and yeah, just weird. 300mg codeine by itself usually gives me vastly more euphoria than I experienced last night even given it was my first time doing oxycodone and I must have taken easily over 100mg worth throughout the day.

Next week when I session with mates should I go for a higher initial dose? Say 50mg? Why were my later doses of oxy and codeine yesterday seemingly so ineffective? Quite annoying. Though I guess the silver lining is this rather dissuades me to buying more opiates in the future.

I'm from VA. For years(literally years), my main dude was was bringing me bags bulk directly from the tri state area. More specifically, the very center of best location to cop in the tri-state area. The first stamp that i got for probably a year and a half consistently was always 'Top Gun'. Then after that one there was a similar(clearly the same dope) bags labeled ""Thank you"" . Red letters. I was wondering if anyone else here ever got these bags?

 The quality on them were super and the size was second to none. Literally many of the bags had more than .1g. And i dont say that lightly, because in the dope game, at least around here, ""point"" is a term that is used and regularly abused. a lot of times dope is sold by the point(meaning .1) and it ends up more like 50 mg or even less. An actual point is a pretty fat-ass bag

But the way these bags were, a bundle would almost always be over a gram. Haven't gotten these in a while. Product from same area has still been excellent quality, but lately even from that area where stamps are so prevalent, it has been just bagged together in bulk.

I'm enjoying it thoroughly and it has pretty much eliminated my desire for alcohol which I had a serious problem with. 

I recently acquired 4 percocet, the 5/325 kind. I don't want to waste them so if there is a cross tolerance obviously I will take them at another point in time when I have had a week or two off of kratom. 

Some dudes are saying there's no cross tolerance at all? And others saying I won't feel a thing from 20 mg oxy with my daily kratom use. 

I am very opiate naive and have only used real opiates a handful of times in my life (years ago). Not sure if that makes any difference. 

Another thing I have been thinking is maybe I could take the percocets with a little bit of kratom? Or would this just make me sick? 

Just trying to figure out if taking these would be a waste or not!

Now, all of a sudden, one of my two friends has distanced himself. Like he was only friends with me because we lived together. And I'm now spending time with two of my certain other friends, though it's a hot girl (call her A) and a hot guy (call him K), so bisexual me is okay with that. I've also started kicking it with a dude in his 60's who lives in the assisted living place two doors down (call him S) and the dude who helps him out (call him T); might be his nephew or something, since he's around my age.

So, earlier today I had one of those ""WTF how did I get here?""-type moments of clarity. I just got a connect on some fucking FIRE tar, and picked up 1.5 grams for A. I insisted that she do her tester and first shot with me at my place, since this stuff is way stronger than what we normally get, and I've got narcan here. She's cool with that, we both do shots, both go ""god DAMN that's fucking awesome"", and kick it for awhile. We only just started to get to know each other, and we happen to have a TON in common, so we both enjoyed just being high and talking for a couple hours. K shows up later, and we all kick it while waiting for the regular D-Boy; all is fine.

Then S and T show up. T is a normal dude (other than being fucking *incredible* at card magic tricks, seriously), but S is a crazy character. He wanted to come over and ""smoke"" because he can't at the assisted living place, which I was cool with cuz I assumed it was weed.

It wasn't.

So, he rolls in (literally, since he's wheelchair-bound) with a big metal bowl with a bunch of paints, a can of clear coat, some paper muffin-tin cups, and a loaf of bread. Wtf, but okay. I know that S is an artist; I've seen lots of his tattoo work, his paintings, and his sculptures. He is legitimately a VERY talented dude, so I figure he wanted a place to make some art or whatever. How the bread came into it was anyone's guess.

He sets it all down, instructs T exactly how he wanted it to be set up on my dining room table, and pulls out his Pyrex. Aaaaaaand now I realize why he's such a character. But, fuck it; I've done plenty of meth in my life, and Thursday and Friday is my weekend. So he puts a LARGE amount of ice into the globe, takes a few *massive* hits, and passes it around, telling us to share it as he works. So, A, K, T, and I all pass it around dutifully; we're all experienced drug users, and don't turn down free drugs.

S takes some bread, rips it up and throws it into the bowl, and throws in some water. He starts to sort of knead it, adding water as he sees fit, until it was *almost* like a bread based clay, and then he adds a bunch of paint, dumps it on the table, and starts using T's ID card (that's right, he didn't even use his own) to sort of cut the bread-paint-clay like it was coke. All the while, the rest of us sort of chat while taking rips of meth.

This is when I had my wtf moment. I'm high on amazing tar, ripping what I'm now realizing is some *REALLY* good meth, while chatting with people I've known for less than two months (some less than a few *days*), while watching an old man play with Wonderbread like it was fuckin' Play-Doh and pretending it was totally a normal thing people do. What. The. Fuck.

It all ended up sorta okay though. We killed the globe of ice and smoked a bunch of cigs until D-Boy got there, after which K, A, and I did another shot of Texas' Finest Tar™. Eventually, S finished his work, and when we came inside from smoking even more cigarettes, he honestly amazed the fuck out of all of us:

[Fucking look at this shit!](http://imgur.com/a/bxpst)

After that, K and A had to leave, and since the bitch of a nurse from the assisted living place was going on a tear looking for him, so did S, dragging along T.

if you live in a place where you arent punished (ie put in jail) for using heroin (in the case that you actually overdosed and need medical help) i especially recommend this app.


this would also be helpful in the case of, for example, cold copping or maybe buying dope from someone new and you get bad vibes from them. especially for females. because if you let go on purpose (for good reason), 911 is alerted that youre possibly in danger (because this person is trying to harm you by trying to rob you, rape you, kidnap you, assault you, etc) they will find you and arrest the person. the best part is that you do not talk or text at all, so the person trying to harm you will have no clue that the police will be there in a matter of minutes.


of course this has other purposes. for people in a domestic violence situation for example, its an easy way to get your piece of shit bf/gf or partner/spouse locked up. or if youre walking alone at night, and think someone might be following you. this app actually has many purposes.


personally, i mostly use it at night, because im most anxious when im in the dark, alone, lying down, etc (probably some abuse related bullshit). it helps so much, it gives me that peace of mind knowing that if for whatever reason something happened to me randomly or someone is attempting to harm me, that i will soon be safe.

I need to go do a shot of oxy on her grave, because she loved oxy and I can't get opana.

I drummed my belly a lot during my binge, really hard. Buttt5 is this a blood infection. Looks similar to something I saw on my friends kegs back when he was a meth head whi picked his scabs.

I lost my apt. I need to go to treatment at least until I csn move on my own. They refused to give me 3 weeks to look for s place. Work is ok with a 3 month leave of absence so I'm looking inbtge bright side.

Psych guy is pushing doc for clonodine....does it help a great deal?  Net access will be spotty gor a few weeks and then library based largely.

I met a guy in a wheelchair mocking kids who talk about HA connections. Thought he said something about liquid morphine. Turns out he was talking about hydromorphone!!

He gets 60 pills of 1mg pills.
He'll sell those to ne for 120. This is good right??,
He also gets 2 mg vials and pills.
Ths vials are more of a novelty thing, correct.

I think he said for like 300 2mg pills ge wants 500?? I forget. I was just so pumped about getting 60 pills. Tbh.. I want to move out in my own again but I can go into or recovery houses that will let me work but are supposedly terrible..... so idk. I guess I'm taking 3 months off. I dont want to stop working for years at a time.

I need to keep this guy in my back pocket. I've always wanted to get a large bottle if hydrmorphone. 

I was thinking of starting with the 60 1mg for 120. Good deal?  I'll try a few then store them with a friend tgat doesn't use. 

He gets tge fast acting and slow acting.

I want IR not XR. Right.

There have been two 30 day stints and real inpatient medical detoxes at 20000 grand a pop.  Then there has been three stays at a 6 month non medical ""tough love"" treatment center, and that's the one I came to tell you guys about (and yes I completed each 6 month stint for a total of 540 days)

This place is called the bridges of hope and there are 3 or 4 of them sprawled through out rural Georgia.  Like I said it's long term 6 months to a year, there is no medical staff and there are no custodians or cafeteria people the whole place is run by the residents from grounds work to maintenance whatever you get it.  Anyways this place is pretty tough, although it is voluntary but if you leave this place is seriously in the sticks in the middle of Mennonite country.

After driving 7 hours with about 2 in bum fuck we drive  down the immaculate 1 mile long dirt entrance I got a bad feeling in my gut

After my intake which was pretty much what are you on and do you have aids I was checked in and had me head shaven with no guard (bald) at this point I was still really high but they had confiscated all my other stuff and flushed it.  No meds to be given not even Tylenol and at this point I was doing about a gram a day

So every morning we would wake up at 5 30 on the dot (in a room with 3 bunks so 6 people to a room) you would shave every morning and then eat breakfast at 6

At 6 30 am we had devotion which was an hour long meeting where we read the daily meditation then shared on it sitting up straight in our chairs feet flat on floor shirts tucked in with a belt

At 7 30 am the store opened where we had to stand single file in a line no talking or you got wrote up (if you got written up you had a write a chapter of the big book each same offense you got your amount doubled so I know bills story like the back of my hand I've written it no lie atleast 100 times) the store had cigs and chips and drinks

At 8 the work day started each new person was assigned to a crew ie such as road crew for the entrance lawn crew for the grounds maintenance for anything that broke..well you have the idea.  I was assigned the road crew so I would get out there at 8 am with a 650 backpack blower and start at one side of the mile long road and blow leaves until 2, even if it was the middle of December and they were falling faster than I could blow 

At 12 we had lunch which was usually a piece of bologna on a piece of bread with water

At 12 30 it was back to your assigned job until 2 (no going inside until work was over)

Then at 2 15 to 3 we had a aa meeting until 3

3 to 5 was free time where you could either sleep or workout, we played softball and volleyball a lot as well

5 we had dinner

At six we had another meeting but instead of an hour this one was 2 hours still sitting straight no armrest feet flat on the floor eyes ahead.  We usually read the big book aloud going down the row 

At 8 we could shower  (could not do it in morning only shave by sink) then we could kinda walk around the campus but at 10 we had head count to make sure no one ran away and at 10 30 it was lights out and get ready to do it all again at 5 30!

For those wondering we had tv and movies only on Saturday night and Sunday when we had more free time

There was too many rules to even write but if anyone has any specific questions feel free to ask

This place is called the bridges of hope they have 3 men's facilities and one women's scatterd about rural Georgia and the Georgia court system often sends people here in lui of jail or prison.  

TLDR: crazy non medical rehab in the sticks in Georgia I went to for a total of 540 long days (3 trips) with a tough love mentality and so many rules your head would spin

so due to some money issues i had to split up my pain dosage and do a quarter of the month first then  pick up the final 1/4 near the end.


welll.....pharm informs me and says they messed up anid gave me too few [EXPENSIVE PAIN MED]s and ended up giving me (and I kid you not, 30 extra ones)

I was under the impression that the amount of narcotics they had on had was HEAVILY monitored and they would know at the end of the money that they would come up short on count....


I also gotta say that this pharm deals with ALOT of pain patients so its not like dealing with roxys opanas, etc etc isnt unusual and they never have to specalty order any meds of mine.

I gotta use a throw away because i know people on here might excognize my name and know where my pharm is. also I dont want to mention the med, but lets just say its a high dosage opiate narcotic. my plan is to sit on them until my next refill and if they say something i'll tell them i just didnt do a count and return the extras. otherwise Im planning on just sitting on them for a rainy day.


I dunno if this has ever happened to any of you guys and how it panned out. I really think that cause this pharm deals  with  TONS of opiate narcotics they dont check they books as much as they should.

anyways love you guys all, would love some feedback. again cant say my state or med or condition as I do not want to DOXX myself (some people on here know me IRL and if they were to contact my pharm and try to fuck me over, would kinda stink). 

Peace to all

I've seen plenty of heroin addiction and I get that shit, that is my shit! 

But how the hell did sizzurp become such a thing amongst you guys in America, particularly outside of Lil Wayneish hip hop circles? This confuses the hell out of me, I must admit. In my country codeine is OTC, as are tablets where promethazine is the only active ingredient (and I have sometimes used this to potentials my gear when money was tight), but abusing both together just isn't something we do. I guess part of it might be proper pharms being a thing here; it's either codeine/tramadol or heroin, with no real in between stuff around. But I've definitely seen a lot of lean discussion amongst you US people on here, so could anyone explain what the hell is up with the sizzurp scene across the pond, and how it came to be a thing? 

I hope you guys are all doing well. You all helped me feel so much less alone in the depths of my addiction, and I'll be eternally grateful for that.

My loss is your gain though since I initially wrote so much and said so little. The length and scope of the original post was proof enough that I'm tweaking.

So I've been getting the same stamp for months now. It was clearly cut with fent or fent and buffer. I liked it though since it had legs that were the stuff of legend. I'm talking one decent shot kept me well for 24 hours before my nose would start to run. Needless to say my buddies and I were all about it.
2 weeks ago my plug reupped, which he had done many times without a change in quality. I didn't even notice any difference till the next day. It was my day off so like a kid on Christmas I eagerly got out of bed and did my shot.
I'm sure plenty here can relate to the joy of s morning fix followed by returning to bed, to read and lie next to the woman I love. We adore doing this even though it usually leads to falling asleep and wasting that dose.
This morning though was different. I was so excited for my shot I didn't realize that I had woken up 2 hours earlier than normal. Sweet rush, had a cig grabbed the current weird nj and got back in bed.
This is when I noticed it. I couldn't focus and read more than a sentence. Nor could I get comfy. After 5 minutes of this bs I got out of bed and immediately began cleaning my apartment.
This wasn't your normal ""well I'm finally high I should tidy up after lying here sick for 36 hours."" Kinda thing we can all relate to. No this was a furious gotta clean everything that seemed to emanate from some deep dark part of my being. Especially odd given the fact I'm a slob. I cleaned for 4 hours.
I talked with my friends who had gotten the same shit and also were fond of previous batches. 4 out of 5 agreed said this current batch is wrong. Even more interesting though they all found themselves cleaning after taking some. It didn't seem to matter that they had jobs to go to and get ready for they were in hard core cleaning mode.

Now what could this be? Is there a fent analogue with amphetamine like quality? It felt like adderal or Ritalin but even dirtier. It also didn't give the rush any extra oomph. Now I had really liked these bags in addition to their legs they are also strong nearly ruined actual heroin for me but I can't take this tweak anymore. I didn't sleep last night and it makes me downright uncomfortable anymore.
Funny thing is the dealer claims it's simply stronger and I need to build my tolly to it. I hate when ignorant hood rats try to explain these things to me, having studied chemistry extensively. 
So any guesses as to what I have here?

Tl;dr the tweaked out exhausted ramblings of a dissatisfied customer who's once consistent stamp suddenly became a powerful stimulant in addition to it's usual pseudo dope fent shit.

From what I've gathered, rehab institutions are apparently a mix of medical detox and psychotherapy. Also, they seem to be pretty short in duration, I've read about rehab programs shorter than a month. Is that accurate or is my assessment wrong?


Here in Germany, you usually head to an actual hospital for detox (2-3 weeks with a Methadone and then Lyrica taper). Afterwards it's off to rehab. Rehab itself is at least six months for actively addicted users. Then, you have the option of aftercare, assisted living in a halfway house etc

Most will probably end up being from my past, but fuck if I haven't been having some crazy days as of late.

Today was my Sunday: I get every Thursday and Friday off work. It also happened to be, oh buddy I have a pants tent: PAYDAY! So, I get my good ol' buddy K to come pick me up so we can go pick up some of, once again, Texas' Best Tar™©®. We gotta drive to the next town over, and I don't have a car, so we take K's truck. It all went smoothly and uneventfully: we get to [unnamed town here], pick up, and head back towards home.

Now, in case you haven't been paying attention, lemme tell you: southern and southern/central Texas has been in absolute ***CHAOS*** as of late. And, while I've managed to not be in Corpus Christi or Houston, that doesn't mean that flooding is the *only* relatively major crisis in the southern half of the Lone Star State. What we've been dealing with in places that aren't currently poop-filled swimming pools has been a lack of supplies. Stores have been running out of food, water, and as of the past couple days, we've had a gas shortage. Or, to look at it as a realistic and non-sensational person, we've had people panicking over a *potential* fuel shortage, which, ironically, has CAUSED an actual shortage.

But, try as we might to avoid the absolute insanity that has been every single gas station, driving between major cities in the second largest state in the union (and really, who counts Alaska?) requires fuel, and we ended up needing some.

As such, we had to stop for gas in San Antonio, and ended up having to call around to find a gas station that even had gas. And even once we did, I had to wait for 45 minutes in a line of cars stretching out of the station itself and nearly two full blocks down the road, as K walked to the convenience store half a block away for snacks, cigarettes, water, and 4Locos (oh yeah, we get *down* like that, baby).

Finally, I had managed to not kill myself (withdrawing while waiting in line to get gas so I can get home and do the dope that I already had sitting in my pocket oh my god I can't stop moving sneeze sneeze sneeze sneeze sneeze sneeze), and I was pumping my gas. And as I'm leaning on the truck, head back and eyes closed, listening to the gas pump glug away while I try to ignore the persistent urge to just thrash my arms around and crawl out of my skin, there were gunshots on the other side of the gas pump, probably less than 40 feet away.

It turns out, as someone was pulling away from the other side of the pump I was using, some asshole in a Mustang, who hadn't been waiting in line and had JUST arrived at the station, drove around the line, over a small patch of grass, and tried to shove his way up to the pump the other car was just pulling away from. The person who was supposed to be next, and had been waiting in line patiently, was a BIGASS cowboy dude in a big truck that was outfitted specially for ranch work and had a full gun rack in the back window. He was NOT amused (neither was his cowboy hat, I think), so he pulled out his wild-west wheelgun and started firing at the dude in the Mustang. Though, to be fair, he wasn't actually trying to shoot him: he was shooting over his head to scare him (which worked: the Mustang IMMEDIATELY booked it out of there like preteen at a NAAMBLA meeting). But, also to be fair, I was on the other side of the Mustang from the scary cowboy man, and when hot lead starts flying directly towards me, I'm out. 

So, I throw the nozzle back onto the pump and close up the truck's gas tank, faster than I thought I could, considering my fingers were currently at war with each other and trying to clench, just to annoy each other. And then I'm in the truck, it's running, I run over the same patch of grass as the Mustang, and I'm **GONE**.

I was probably nearly a mile away before I realize, ""oh shit, I left K! Oh, yeah, I guess I should go back for him, since this IS his truck..."" Then we drive back to my place, make a beeline to our designated junkie spots on my couch, and finally, FINALLY, get well.

And, just cuz I can, and it's beautiful: [here's a pic of *some* of the amazing, fire, glassy-black tar we went on this adventure to get. 100% worth it.](http://i.imgur.com/D3VNC76.jpg)

Since my pills connect refused to hook up bth: ""because it makes people go down a bad path,"" I had to find another connection. In reality I just think he likes to sell overpriced pills only. On the plus side, he would actually deliver, so he that was badass.

I found my bth connect on CL. I found a second one on CL as well, but he has been so damned flakey, I've never hooked anything up from him. So the only bth I know of is the stuff I get from the first guy.

I wondering how to gauge the quality of the bth. Is it usually better if it has a gooey consistency or if it is hard? Does color usually give any hints as well? My bth connect has always been on time, which is amazing. I've hooked up from him four times now and he is literally always within ten minutes of the agreed upon meeting time, but I'm not sure about the quality of the bth. During the vetting process on CL he blew me off for a few days at the beginning because he usually won't sell to people older than he is, which makes me wonder if he cuts his shit into oblivion since most his customers might be younger opiate naive people. 

The gear I have been getting is hard and not gooey at all. It is dark brown in color and is a bit sticky. For example if I break a piece in half to smoke it, I can definitely tell it is sticky. When I heat it on the foil it doesn't stay a liquid. As soon as the heat is removed it re-solidifies. In some youtube videos it looks like when people heat the car it stays melted. So each time I go strike my lighter I have to re-heat the car and then let it trail on the foil. When it does trail across the foil it leaves a somewhat thicker darker brown trail that I can go back and smoke again after. 

I'm wonder if this gear is sub-par or not. I have a fairly high tolerance as I was going through about 600mg of oxy a day. Usually 240mg per dose.",1504308563.0

i really was taking the good with the bad and at first the good won out every time. even when dope sick i would be almost euphoric just thinking about the next come up. so my question is what do you all think of this phrase? a legit argument or just another junkie justification? does your good outweigh your bad while using?

have been low on spending cash as of late and so have had to just maintain with the bare minimum which has caused me to start thinking of doing some wild things once i return to glory and have money in my pocket.


so this would be something i would at least like to try once in my life but not sure if it would work or if i would die or get too high before i could successfully mix in all the drugs in one incredible high.


anyway i would like to mix all in one high:


kratom and kava - never tried kratom


some good weed smoked and eaten


ketamine - never tried


clonazepam


soma


hydrocodone and oxycodone


codeine and morphine



probably some other stuff too but i forget now

I take solace in how humanely the animal is killed though. They slice the jugular and the sheepy just bleeds to death. It's quick. Then my family spent the entire day making tagines (Moroccan stews) out of the entire sheep. Even the intestines. NOTHING goes to waste. Anything extra gets donated to the poor.

Anyway, I grabbed my normal thing from my normal guy last night and did my normal thing last night and again this morning, and the high is normal, just as expected. 

However, I have been shitting my brains out for the past 6 hours, after not having had a bowel movement for 4-5 days (about average constipation for me). And this isn't just normal shitting. I'm dumping buckets of water mixed with half-solid shit every 45 minutes or so. And my stomach is twisting up in knots pretty bad. 

Obviously dope typically backs you up, but has anyone ever had this type of reaction? If so, do you know what the cause was? I've heard of dealers cutting product with laxative, but I've always imagined that, if true, the laxative effects aren't enough to offset the constipating effects, which is the why the net result of dope usage is pretty much always severe constipation. And even if my diarrhea is unrelated, it's very surprising to me that the dope isn't enough to solidify me up.

No specific time but I thought that would be sufficient. Then my friend who is the point of contact for the sub guy says he'll be here today just a matter of when. Then at like 10pm he gets a text response where the guy says he'll call in a little bit. Probably said that so he wouldn't have to keep texting. The later text response after midnight got a response asking if he could come in the morning tomorrow. Well shit, just give me a fucking set time.

&nbsp;

Naturally, ambiguity is on the menu. So he'll bring it tomorrow but I honestly don't know when. He say's **he'll be up before noon.** If I was directly in contact with the guy I would ask if he was delivering before noon or simply waking up before noon. You know, being up before noon to the letter of the word could literally mean he's waking up. It says nothing about a delivery time per se. 

&nbsp;

My best option is to plan around not getting the subs tomorrow. I'll have a better sense of control if I wake up assuming there will be no sub delivery. Just face whatever minor sensations I have, eat, force myself to exercise and then I'll do what I was planning to do anyway. I'll clean my room a little bit, take care of the animals and then try to eat some more. From there, there's one thing that results in good things. I'll ride my bike to my bud guy, spend time in good company and smoke a blunt the biking and blunt will help me tremendously.

&nbsp;

Now let's talk about shit that has gone right. Earlier this week my friend owed roxies and the plan was to get them on monday. There was a new law that prevented him from being able to call in a refill at 9AM so his doctor had to call him back at like 5PM. After pleading with him, he made an exception this once. From there it was sent but the store was out of stock so we had to wait one more day. The following day we picked it up on time and my friend gave me what was owed.",1504418962.0

I keep hearing that people get in the program and with benzos they get a good high on par or better than heroin. i doubt that theres any euphoria? but maybe some people do thats why im asking?,"me personally ive never taken more than a prescribed dose of benzos on top of a prescribe reasonably high dose of juice. i just dont fuck around double dosing for about about 5 different positive reasons i can name. 1 there goes tommorrow dose. 2 tolerence killer. 3 possible bottle check and worked hard staying off dope to earn take outs and aint willing to fake a drugs tests. thats not why i got into this program.4 thats how people die trying to catch the type of chasing high that oull never get with methadone or benzos. people are looking for that great feeling from when them took opana the first . trith is even opana wouldnt create that same magic after 2nd time and long term maitnence paitent. but why not enjoy a drug for what it does offer , a chacnce for people who want to live a better life then there living but are not chemically able to deal with life with out there system being healthy agian wheter it be on long term maitinence or detox and then long term sobrity with conseli ng and most likely some sorta anti sep. they will try to push on u but i say mine as well take methadone if u gonna take any drugs in recovery. if u can take if responsibly and enjoy if benifits and understand there are negitves with methadone but id say that there are benifits and negitves to any aspect of any substance project human relationship job what ever it may be. the decision comes down to doe sthe pros out weigh the cons and do the seriousness of each pros and cons equal out of does the cons out weigh the pros.

I consumed the last of my opiates today and it has been a freaking good time. Im expecting at least some minor shittiness in coming days but what are your thoughts on my useage and any resulting hangover/withdrawals.

Below is my last two weeks using.

Before: Codeine 300mg once a week a few times.

**Week before last**

Monday: 300mg codeine

Tuesday: 300mg codeine

Wednesday: 300mg codeine

Thursday-Sunday: **NOTHING**

**Past week**

Monday: 300mg codeine

Tuesday: **NOTHING**

Wednesday: 15mg oxycodone + 180mg codeine

Thursday: 100mg oxycodone + 300mg codeine

Friday: 15mg oxycodone

Saturday: 75mg oxycodone

Sunday (today): 40mg oxycodone + 300mg codeine

I realize this isnt one of the healthiest things i've done but some time off work and running into opiates in this period led me to my first ever real dabble.

Ive finished my stock today and plan to indefinitely stop using this stuff recreationally; I could see the justifications and urges produced by them in action and I reckon ive exhausted the reasonable extent of this indulgence. Addictive stuff!

Been clean for over 3 months and I'm about to throw it all away. I just can't take it anymore--the loneliness, depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. On the outside I look like I'm doing good and everyone keeps complimenting me. ""You're doing a great job stonedtemplepilots keep it up."" And I keep responding that I'm *not* doing fine, that tears would be pouring down my face multiple times a day, if I could cry. But I can't cry anymore for some reason, no matter how sad I get. I've thought about suicide every day for the past month and a half. I didn't get sober to keep being miserable. I have no fucking friends anymore, no one I can vent to. I got into a rehab romance against all advice and now the girl is dating someone else. I invested so much emotion into her (fucking stupid, I know) and now I'll never be able to have a relationship with her. I don't know why I'm even writing this. I guess there's a small part of me that is still clinging to sobriety. I'm not going to get high tonight but I've already made plans to do so tomorrow. I'm on the vivitrol shot so I won't be able to do dope for a while but I'm really obsessing about shooting coke again.

Then got me arrested for physically removing me out after announcing she was going to take a shower to go to work instead of leaving after I told her to go. I had no support network to pick up the pieces. Family was shit.

How many men/women gave up on their primary goal (which was love) and chose heroin over all else after an experience like this?

I just feel like the only thing I cared about isn't a real possibility. Everything else was a means to an end. I just wanted one woman to not cheat on me and to show me respect.

I wasn't around, but she talked about taking whatever she could get her hands on and taking shit before going into work on the regs and stuff. I know for some this is normal, but it concerned me at the time being my little sister.

At the time she also lived with two heroin users, both of whom have since OD'd and passed away. She always said she stayed away from H, but I've never really know. This all went down in a college town in NC.

Anyway, she tells this story about having a couple of friends over before work. Her friend brought over what appeared to be an orange liquid in a syringe (no needle). She was told one dose would be like doing a bar of xanax. So she and her friends all dosed it - they put a bit under their tongues. She said it burned.

After that, she has no recollection. She says she woke up in her bed with a citation for having a fake ID. She was told later that her boyfriend dropped her off at work. She was stumbling around at work, incoherent and unable to speak. They fired her on the spot, though she didn't find out until she called to ask what happened. She has no idea how she got the ticket or how she got home.

Her boyfriend supposedly dropped her off at work, went to Dunkin' Donuts and ordered one of everything on the menu. He then attempted (they think) to drive back to her, but proceeded to put his car in park in the middle of the busiest intersection in town and pass out. He was obviously arrested.

This was months and months ago now, but I thought this community might help identify what it was that they had taken, since no one really seems to know.

I woke yesterday morning racking my brain trying to figure out what I was gonna do, seeds I guess, lope maybe? Well I read my emails before I went to the store and saw a holiday sale for Kratom, deal I couldn't pass up so I ordered a rather hefty variety pack knowing it won't arrive till Tuesday too. Went to the store and bought 6 bottles of cheap seeds very reliable in the past. That's a lb and a half so that's a day well. Started to feel shitty like spastic colon time so I did a big shot, so much for conservation I preceded to get high after I was well and saved a morning one for today which would be the last of it. Well you know what I did this morning while the coffee was brewing and I had the seeds some etizolam and my 600 mg. gabapentin script so I figured I'd deal with Sunday and Monday as they came, maybe get some lope and ride it out till the mail came on Tuesday. A few hours ago I was gonna wash a half pound of seeds just to keep well and I heard the mailman close the metal mailbox or so I thought so I looked outside and saw the mail truck down the street. Ah what the hell get the mail maybe you got a class action check ( yeah I do that too thanks to this sub!) down all the stairs open the box and....... WTF! a priority envelope! My ass flew up the stairs cuz I was freaking as to "" what the hell is this?"" The DN order was shipped yesterday, the Kratom order too so wtf? I tore it open and it's the kratom! The vendor is 3 states away, in 27 hours it made it to me at such a crucial time. This isn't a JJ moment I firmly believe a higher power pitied my old holiday forgetting ass and dealt me a solid! I mean how can a man hear all week on the news about holiday traffic and such and totally forget when he's punching the keys ordering that there's a holiday? Well I'll do some seeds tomorrow cuz I ate 10 grams of Red Bali in apple sauce with cinnamon sugar and I'm feeling mighty fine, far from nodding but further from sick.

Got a fire batch and was gone out of my mind. My two younger brothers saw me falling down, crawling on the floor, slurring my words and they were justifiably angry at me.

My little brother even started insulting me pretty hard (""you can't even stand up or walk, I'd knock you out. You look like you weigh 40 pounds"", etc. to the point it kind of killed my high. I'm 7 years older than him and he looks up to me and never saw that side of him so it hurt.

But the asshole in me somehow came out and I got some of my own insults fired back at him, but I eventually made up with him and everything is cool. According to him, I started the initial argument, but of course, I don't remember that shit.

So I can imagine how it'd be to see a loved one completely FUCKED up and I don't blame them at all for their anger.

So I got to thinking about my dad. He's the only one that never saw me like really high on IV heroin. And I'm not sure how he'd react. He has a short fuse so I would expect him to try to wake me out of it by hitting me (hasn't beaten me since I was a little kid).

I can't imagine him straight up punching me, but definitely shaking the fuck outta me or maybe even bringing back the belt on my ass lol.

Omw i realize my ventra card was gone but tthe CTA conductor lets me on the El anyway. ShoutOut to her. We convince the dboy to do 1 hard 1 blow for 10 and vada buys a blow too. While we're at the park gettin to, 12 rolls right past so the deal is rushed and we dip. I reach in the bag and give Vada his right around the cornhisand head to a different park. I look in the bag anddddd 2  BLOWS 2 ROCKS MOTHERFUCKKER!  And my vinegar was with me. 1 THICK 45 unit shot and god damn. Now im at the park by my library, reading Lovecraft in the sun.

Wait 3 min usually and repeat. 

Wait another 3 and. Usually do the last 2 lines as whole lines up each nostril. And within 20 min i feel it hard. And it lasts hours.

We both take opiates pretty regularly-I am prescribed them and he buys on the street. He brought H home once almost a year ago when we couldn't cop the regular stuff and I flipped out. I've never seen it before and have always been terrified of it. 
I made him flush it. He promised he would never do it again.
I'm terrified that I will do it and die.
Last week I confronted him on some of the things that I found odd:
1) Needle caps in my bed after he spent the night
2) He refuses to let me meet this one hookup (even though I've met them all) and says that I am too crazy to meet him.
3) He has been texting the guy things like 'one point or two'? He says that is code for adds or op's
4) Said guy randomly started blowing my guy up with messages about how 'I just realized I shorted you, I'll make it up so you don't get sick' my guy said that meant that he was supposed to get 2 pills but only got one...so you didn't notice that you were short a whole pill until he started messaging you telling you that he shorted you?

The worst part is the lies and him telling me that I'm crazy for thinking that he's doing H.
So I've had this guilt for accusing him and have felt crazy and have stopped trusting myself

Since last night I've been sniffing/smoking just enough to keep a nice steady buzz going and, somewhat consequently, have only slept about three hours out of the last 60 or so. I know sleep deprivation will make you trip out but I've stayed up for a while before and this seems different. 
It seems like there's always a person in the corner of my eye but when I turn to look s/he always turns into some inanimate object that happens to match the color coordination of the person's clothes perfectly. I'm also seeing like flocks of birds and bugs that I would swear are real when I see them but then they simply disappear and I'm then forced to consider I may be becoming psychotic.
Then there's the auditory hallucinations; I'm consistently hearing conversations and music that I would, again, swear are real but I can never identify a source upon further investigation.
What's really wild is the the kind of like wavy, trippy, kind of LSDy-looking patterns appearing in thin air and in the clouds and in trees. Very much more like a psychedelic trip than any sleep deprivation I've experienced before.
I'm not really complaining about all this. Mostly I've just found it to be very interesting and unexpected and I was wondering if anyone knows if there's anything special happening here. Like, does it have anything to do with the H or do I just need to go to sleep (probably should do that regardless). Also would be interested in seeing if anyone has had similar experiences.

My background is in neuroscience, and I could spend hours poring over studies to find the answer, but wanted to ask here in case anybody happened to know and could provide an immediate answer.

Obviously they're both mu-opioid agonists, with the primary benefit of heroin being that it really just metabolizes into morphine after passing the blood-brain barrier. But, that would then (I'm guessing based on my limited knowledge) mean that oxycodone is going to be a notably different molecule, potentially opening it up to other agonistic properties?

You know how those who have tried tar vs ecp say tar is a fuller high or warmer w/e? Which is true btw. I feel like my kratom highs are like that compared to tar if that m akes sense. Fuller. Like the other alkaloids at work just go so well with my body chemistry it's amazing. 

Just wanted to put this out there for for anyone trying to quit opiates but still wants to get high on opiates. Contact me for info on how to make consumption a more enjoyable experience since most people just say to man up and do a toss and wash which is nasty. Theres more effective and tasty ways to consume kratom that will have you loving the taste of different strains. Also go to r/kratom there's a guide at the top on how to switch from opiates to kratom. 

I'm amazed at this plant. Yes, there are still withdrawals, but they are nothing compared to dope withdrawals.

Left Friday and will be home late Monday night. Well anywho I brought some blues with me but of course went through them faster than anticipated and just did my last one. Well luckily last night I accidentally stumbled across an oldish bottle of hydros in my G-pas kitchen cabinet (was looking for a bowl) who I'm visiting). They were Rx'd to him over a year ago, but he doesn't like to take medicine even though hes 89 years old. He wont even take sleep meds even though he has terrible issues sleeping. I know for a fact he will never know some of them missing as the bottle was pretty much full so I took 15 leaving about 50 left, and unfortunately he can't really see anymore. Any who I know the CWE method but my question is, can you dry out that powder into a snortable powder?  The good news is I purposely left 2.5 blues at home so they'll be waiting for me when I get back as it will prob be too late to find anything upon arriving home. ",1504498886.0

Pupils pinned, nodding off, the works. 

So the next day I asked him how he liked it. He said ""well, I can see why you like them. They give me the like, behind the eyes, 'fucked up' feeling I look for when I smoke weed."" And I was like shit dude, u right. Cause when I smoke I'm trying to get to the same level of ""good"" that opioids give me, but it's never quite what I'm looking for.

It's hard to say something that I haven't said before when I tried to stop and ended up going back, but things are good. I always thought people were full of shit when they said that things get better when you get sober, but it's correct. 

I guess I'm just posting because I'm wondering how long it'll be until full pleasure comes back. I'm completely able to enjoy things, but I'm always bored. I constantly need to be doing something. Thank God I start this new job next week, which I'd like to touch on. 

When I was using I didn't want to do shit besides isolate myself in my room, try to find money for dope, and then do dope. The second I said ""fuck this"", applied for a job, and legitimately stopped doing dope, I have a job coming up. I don't know, maybe I'm just weird, but it felt like a sign to me. 

One more thing: I feel like since I'm not doing dope anymore I NEED something else there, and for me it's weed. I've been smoking bud for 8, almost 9 years total and I of course pushed it to the side while in active addiction. I feel as though I'm still displaying, as they say in rehab, ""addict behavior"" by like needing bud. Example being if I don't have any I'm on the hunt for people who will front or spark up, in the same way and same intensity that I would be when I was looking for dope and truly thought I needed the dope. I don't know guys, help. 


TL;DR: When are you fully able to enjoy things after stopping opiates, and also, when will I stop feigning for bud as if I physically need it? ",1504493208.0

Today was similar except when I got to his house I was immediately instructed to board an icecream truck. Had to sit on the step by the door so I wasn't visible to the outside world.  The vehicle was old, a bit rickety and with the constant hum and sputter of the refrigeration compressor. Warm air rushed from the cracks between metal plates at the front of the vehicle. Above the steps, on the right side of the dashboard is a regular household stereo with a CD change held in place by a single bungie cord. 

&nbsp;

After the ATM run we drive to the 'hood to get the d. He drops me off and I walk around slow. A couple of minutes later he scoops me up and we get going. The middle originally agreed to do this at the cost of two bags out of a bun and a half. Well, he altered the terms. Told me he took three and said ""I'm risking my truck, driving while I work and sometimes I don't even ask for anything.""

&nbsp;

Bullshit. He always takes a fucking cut. Every fucking time. More times than not he takes one additional bag. It's a good thing my friend didn't agree to give him three because then he'd probably take four. **Last week** this kid begged my friend to spot him three bags till later that evening. Promised to pay him back with five bags. My friend figured, fuck it.. more for all us over here. Of course we checked in later that evening and he told us to calm down, that he would have us today/tonight. Then it became obvious this wasn't happening tonight so the following day he said he'd get us ten subs. Not a fair trade but if that's what he wants to do, we agreed to it. The following day the sub connect was incognito. Going back to the **present day** my friend revealed to me that the middle didn't take any thing last time he picked up dope because he owed us and had yet to pay us back. So yeah, like I said bullshit. He never did anything for nothing. The one time he did was because he owed it.


&nbsp;

Twenty minutes after I got back to my friend's house he got a text from the sub connect who we've been waiting on all weekend. The guy texted, ""what's up?"" So my friend texted the same back to him. That motherfucker. All weekend he was saying he'd be around at some point on saturday. That it was a matter of ""when"" but then he postpones til today. Say's he'll be up before noon but doesn't remotely indicate a delivery time. Would've preferred the bupe but we had to enact plan B before it was too late to do anything at all.

&nbsp;

As I was about to depart from the truck, the bungie cord fell. It looked pretty frayed to begin with and I guess it was on it's last leg. I quickly told the driver about it as I left. I don't think he heard me. I almost hope the fucking stereo falls out the door.",1504483200.0

So I am in a bit of a quandary over my prospective plans for labor day tomorrow. I am supposed to go to Kings Dominion (a bigass amusement park) bright and early tomorrow morning with this chick, she invited me over a month ago and even bought my ticket. 

I had this foolproof scheme about how I was going to telework Friday and use that day and the long weekend to withdraw from Fentadope in time to be feeling better by tomorrow when we're supposed to go. 

Trouble is, I love this white Turbodope I've been getting recently and have been unable to stop using. Tomorrow is my LAST chance to get on sub before the work week begins, and I'm 100% unwiling to have to rely on dope to get me thru another week at the office. 

So normally I would spend Labor Day tomorrow convalescing and and going through creepy taxidermied fox withdrawal until I can induct on subs. At least I have two 8mg subutex pills and a shitload of trazodone, clonidine and gabapentin to get me through the worst of it.

Enter the whole Kings Dominion thing. I really dont want to let this girl down and I'd feel obligated to pay her back for my ticket and probably hers as well, since its too late for her to find another buddy to go with and tomorrow is the very last day of the amusement park season. 

Furthermore, its pretty miserable lying in bed waiting for myself to reach critical withdrawal mass until I can take sub, so the time might go faster if I do something with my day besides wallow in my misery.  

However, I'm deathly afraid of starting to withdraw hard while I'm trudging around an amusement park in the heat and trying not to vomit on roller coasters. An amusement park literally sounds like one of the worst places ever to have to kick at. 

So I really dunno what to do. Would it be better to bail on this chick and WD at home in bed, a situation with which Im intimately familiar with and know what to expect, but never gets any more pleasant.

 Or should I say fuck it, go to Kings Dominion and hope for the best. I guess if I get too sick there I can always demand that she take me home early like a little bitch.

 I am just super worried that the withdrawal from the fentalog dope will be miserable because I'm used to getting regular hayron & this is the first time ive been exposed to the double-edged blade of fentalogs.

Second week I snorted a whole 30. Didn't really feel anything. So drank a beer and snorted the other 30. 60 mg of oxy and a beer and I wasn't feeling shit.

This week I snorted two 30s again. Basically the same thing I got a little high for like an hour, was itchy and kinda drowsy all night. But i never really got high and i feel like the xperience wasn't even worth it.

Is that how oxy tolerance works? Like even if I only use once a week I still won't be able to get a high off of 60 mgs? Am I doing something wrong?

So I'm sitting and waiting and you know the drill. It got to be around 11am... and that nervous feeling overwhelmed me (I dont wanna piss her off and then make it so she purposely makes me wait even longer) so my txt simply stated said: *hi! I hope everything is alright. It's getting to be a little late, so what's up?*

Ten minutes later ... her reply? *ya gotta give me time to wake up* to which I replied *Okay what time you looking at? I have to be to work soon*

Fast forward to 12:15 pm... still nothing. So I txt her again. I said *I can come to you if you need me to, but let me know what's going on. My shift starts at 1pm*  she replied *I'm leaving my house in 5 minutes okay?* I said *okay*

At 12:45 still nothing. She lives 4 minutes from me. So I txt her and said *Okay I have to leave for work.

(GO TO THE BOTTOM IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THE PREFACE AND ALL THE OTHER SHIT)

Lets's rewind to the Wednesday before the most recent one. About a week and a half ago. It was a day were I copped some dog food, and it was a decent batch. Each half bun was in a single bag so I had to try to avoid taking too big of a dose each time. It was pretty potent, and whitish in color this time. 

Nearly ran out of dope that Friday but had enough to stay well for the rest of that evening. The following day I woke up a little shitty, did my last remnant of a dose before work and was straight for about four hours. By the time I made it to work I was back to feeling dope sick and it got worse as the evening drew on. By the time I left work I visited a friend's house to watch the big fight and the air-conditioner was killing me. I had the ill chills. Whatever, smoked and chilled then went home. The next day it was just shitty. Eventually I started feeling better and by day four I was through the worst of it but just in time script day came up and I was given the roxies that were owed to me.

&nbsp;

**Six days of 15mg Roxies**

Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. On the final two days I had like 3 15's, so 45mg each day. Today I'm at 0, but I don't feel that shitty. I'm still hoping to get subs today but I'm not counting on it too heavily because the asshole who was supposed to deliver them yesterday has not committed to shit.

&nbsp;

H withdrawals often kick my ass. It must be that I do high dose in a short span of time before running out.  On the occasions that I've tapered down things are usually mild.

&nbsp;

So the original question:

**Am I in the clear?**

It has been 17 hours since I've taken a roxy 15. I don't feel that shitty. Will I feel shitty tomorrow?",1504467673.0

I picked up a nasty habit while living in China/Hong Kong and have brought it back to the UK with me, and I now really want to stop. I've never used needles or been a heavy user, around a bag (0.2g) a day, snorted. I took a tiny line yesterday morning when I was in WDs just to take the edge off it and I done the same this morning. When I say tiny, I mean a tenth of a bag. Last night I took magnesium suplements, a valium and 2 30mg cocodamol tablets before going to sleep around 10pm and I felt ok and fell asleep no problem. I woke at 2am, with restless legs and sweats/chills etc. I took 2 or 3 more of the codiene tabs and fell back asleep, and again at 5am. My questions are this?

1. Should I forget taking any of these opiates and just deal with cold turkey, or will doing what I'm doing get me off with minimum withdrawals?

2. If i was to get high once after I have been through Wds, would I have to go through WDs all over again, or would it take time to build up to dependence again?

I love this community and always browse, but this is my first post.  Cheers in advance for any help

She texted me at like 2am saying how much she loved the new coke and it was amazing. I think i am not going to tell her it was dope. i don't and made a promise i would never introduce anyone to this hellish devil drug. I don't see any benefit of telling her what it was. She is fine and me telling her may make her want to do it again, freak her out (i would be if i didn't know and i did heroin out of the blue). I don't see any reason to tell her, right guys? 

I am def making sure that never happens again. She never hits herself so i was like out of all times i went to use the bathroom she decides to do it herself and somehow hit within that time (i will say it takes me like 5 min to pee bc of opiates so she had time to dig around for a while)/.

A friend gave me 40mgs of Oxy in 8, 5mg pills.
Day 1: I downed 3 oxy and used ~5mg tar smoked hours later off foil fairly efficiently.
Day 2: 5, 5mg pills with 10-15mg DXM to potentiate, with loads of smoked meth and what I can only guess was ~20-50mg of black tar. I overused the meth and edged for hours before having one of the best orgasms ever. I then smoked the tar to achieve a nod equal to or greater than my first time smoking heroin or first ever nod which was codeine. 
Day 3 (today): After smoking about half a point of heroin throughout the day, I put my last 15mg of oxy in my upper lip for about 20-30 minutes before swallowing. If there's any way to achieve a rush but still get that high bioavailability with oxy, I think this is it. Almost no taste if you do it in the upper lip.

Overall experience: I actually used much more heroin than oxy, but the oxy made me much itchier and surprisingly more energized.",1504594545.0

I haven't ever been to Pain Management but I've been to the doctors and my last script was for 120 Oxycodone 10 mg at my second doctor ( which was lower than my original script of 186 Oxycodone 10 Mg from my first doctor ) I have transverse myelitis which is similar to MS. I'm a female, 4'11, and weigh about 82 pounds.

I have been buying a few here and there from others and my tolerance is still pretty high. I want to go from Oxycodone to Roxies but I've had doctors say that I'm too small to take that large amount even though if taking a smaller amount doesn't take a toll on my Pain. I've been working two jobs and have been taking Kratom for about 8 months ( ever since my insurance went out ). Even while taking Kratom it still hurts especially my back and not to mention my coworkers also say they're back hurts but they don't have no known medical conditions and they usually hog the only available chairs. Kratom has also been way more expensive since I usually go through 30 Grams a day compared to my script being around 100 dollars a month, I'm spending 28 dollars everyday at my gas station so about 196 dollars a week. I'm mostly nervous about the fact that Pain Management will give me a crap script since it's been so long since I've had an actual script.

Question: Does Xanax or heroin produce worse withdrawals after separately taking each for 6 weeks?

Background: I love drugs

Hypothesis: Xanax will cause all sorts of hell 

Test: For the first six weeks I took black tar heroin daily. I would estimate this dope to be average quality. one point is about 30mg oxycodone. I hadn't used for a few weeks before this expirement. I was averaging a half gram/day during the expirement. 

After heroin withdrawals subsided, I took 1.5-2mg Xanax daily for 6 weeks. the Xanax is pharma grade verified. 

No drugs such as kratom/valium were used to taper. Diet/sleep normal. 

results: as I suspected, heroin was a walk in the cake compared to Xanax. 6 weeks on heroin. The heroin withdrawal symptoms consisted of excessive yawning, depression, teary eyes, runny nose, stomach cramps and general lethargy. I was able to sleep quite a bit during the 3 days of withdrawal symptoms. I would wake up with sweats in the night, but I would fall back asleep.

After just six weeks of Xanax use, I felt detached from my body and completely dysphoric. I couldn't even stand up. I was completely rocked FOR 2 WEEKS. Symptoms included muscle spams, extreme anxiety, suicidal depression, the sensation that I was gonna have a seizure (this was the worst symptom). Feeling major anxiety about having a seizure is so uncomfortable. especially when it lasts 2 weeks.

conclusion: don't ever take benzos daily. Only time I would take Xanax is during an acute panic attack or to sedate for surgery

I have done almost every drug besides crack, meth, and heroin. I think that drugs should be legal and tightly regulated. I am dead sober at the moment and hope to stay clean for everything. I may consider MDMA or LSD again. but the rest of the drugs for the most part serve little positive purpose outside of a strict medical context. I was addicted to amps for about 2 years


The last drugs I tried before I quit everything were opium tea and morphine. My friend had poppy pods. He crushed them and made them into a tea. I usually research every drug before I do them, but my addiction to amps at the time made me impulsive this time. This was my first opiate. I remember thinking ""huh this isn't that exciting at all. Nice. but nothing like I expected"". The biggest irony is that on that small-medium dose, I felt more functional and clear than weed. It felt perfectly healthy and I might even say, felt harmless. Needless to say, I was surprised. I quit all amps later that week and over the course of 2 weeks, got fully clean. I cut off old friends and transferred colleges


I recently visited amsterdam and was surprised that addicts there are given free heroin. As long as they stay out of overdose range with their dosing, they go to a govt clinic, and can get a shot of heroin at three scheduled times a day. Only available to people who have tried quitting, its fairly tightly regulated. Crime rates dropped after implementing this. Overdose rates are fairly low. And what surprised me most? 80% of them hold full time jobs. I supported the legalizing of drugs to a fair degree but I never knew the difference in societal outcome would be this good. People act like addicts are animals. It seemed like drug addicts just want to do drugs. and when they do it? Theres no reason to steal or harm anyone. The stigma, poor quality control, high prices, and criminalization of perfectly innocent people is really what causes the problems that we associate with most drugs (my 2 cents)

I was surprised and did some googling. Thats when I found this video:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9huWlXFA1s


On the wiki:


""Like most opioids, unadulterated heroin does not cause many long-term complications other than dependence and constipation.""


I heard stories of heroin rotting your organs out from the inside. And your body slowly shutting down. And that if you are in withdrawal for even an hour, you literally die. In fact, none of these things seem to be true at all. which explains why I felt completely ""normal"" when doing opium. granted, if I became an addict, things would have lost control. But I had thought that after trying opium, it would be the only thing that I could think of for the rest of my life. and that after doing it once, life would become meaningless and I would be a zombie forever. This is retarded, and I might say that its downright harmful to put forth these ideas, as that lack of honesty would give me little real accurate information to make the right choices. If I didn't quit amps and start cleaning myself up, I could have picked up an opium habit. ""Society just overblows these things the same way that they did with weed"", and pick up an opium habit under the assumption that because it felt harmless, it must have been harmless. When I am told that 1/10 people who do cocaine die, I am not sure what to believe. Obviously, reading this sub paints a grim picture of addiction. Harder opiates ruin lives. but HOW and WHY they ruin lives is something that I am just starting to understand. But in pure form, I guess the main issue is the addiction correct? (correct me if I am wrong?)

**Which leads me to a set of questions for this subreddit:**


**I am not ever going to do any opiates outside of legit medical need, so don't hold back at all. I was told that heroin slowly rots your organs and kills you. Clearly this is not true. So what does addiction look like? What IS true? would you support a system similar to the netherlands? You can get set doses of heroin at set times of day? I feel that full legalization is bad news. The pill mills in the south were a real life experiment for that which ended horribly. Which system of regulation would you support? And lastly, how functional could you be given full access to opiates? And assuming you have access to clean opiates in a fairly cheap context, what would your day to day life be like? what would be the negative aspects of the drug addiction? I don't believe the answer is ""living life on heroin daily is the exact same as sober. just with positives!"", but I know what it is not ""your organs shut down and you immediately turn into a zombie"". do you feel pukey all the time? You feel foggy? Lack sex drive? When I am told that heroin rots your organs out only to be told by a quick google search that the main concern is addiction itself, I am not sure what to believe or think? Please help a lurker.

Like what do you personally do , to get the relief you're looking for?

The only two or three things that help me right now are : Meloxicam (NSAID) , Klonopin, and sometimes Robaxin (but i hate the feeling)
Motrin and Tylenol are a given

But what do you use? Another opiate? toradol? tramadol? nucynta? abstral? 


How willing was your doctor to prescribe this for you?


I'd really like to have something very powerful to have on hand when i am experiencing extreme pain. I dont want to hurt myself with tylenol , motrin & meloxicam. I dont even care if its another opiate",1504582552.0

Anyway. Haven't had much luck in the vagina dept since I got sober bc I don't go out to bars anymore and I'm not really in situations like that. 

Met this beautiful girl a few days ago. 9/10. Funny. Smart. Great career/successful. 


Anyways, went out on a couple dates w her. She had some wine and cocktails I just drank water. 

Smashed pissers w her. No rubbah. Feel like $1,000,000 today. 

I really needed that just to prove to myself that I still got it even when I'm not high or drunk.

So after 2 hours and being mega sick thinking we are fucked, we decided to drive by his house and there he was! Claimed he was looking for us, but that was a great moment. One time one of his runners ripped me for $1,100. Half ounce of coke and a bunch of baggies. Didn't hear from him for 8 months and then one day headed to class his area code calls me. There he is. He apologized and took care of that asshole so he said. He then told me to bring up $200. He gave me 90 bags to get back on my feet. That's when I knew we were 100. We keep it as professional as legal businesses and I'm thankful. My only grievance is he rarely fronts me if I ask; sometimes though on bigger orders he will throw me a random $150-$250 front. But beyond those rare events a front usually won't happen. He always complains these junkies never pay so he's done with them. Now he is to the point where he won't move for less than $200. I don't know if that's just for clients who come from far away like me, or if that's a strict policy. I am hoping it's the latter as open air corner hustling is what gets people popped and junkies banging on the dope house door all the time. He drives a Porsche Cayenne and it's pretty sick, so I am assuming he has moved up over the years and only handles larger orders.

I figured if i dissolved the strip in 100 ml of water, how much should I add to make it near the cutoff point? Obviously it's a delicate balance, I can't add too little or it won't show up, but I can't add too much and have it be some insane level.

I need someone to help me with the math haha, c'mon science junkies!

I have 3 oz's of pee btw

UPDATE: IT WORKED! I used ""UPass"" ""fetish urine"" and dissolved a small part of a strip while I was heating it. So far so good! They read the tests there and then also send them to a lab I believe, but they didn't mention anything was out of the ordinary and they definitely would if something was weird.",1504543135.0

I've never liked weed much without other drugs because it just made me very paranoid and over analyse every aspect of my life in extreme depth, however now I live somewhere I don't get judged for smoking and can do so whenever I wish, the anxiety is better. Weed still puts me in a weird borderline psychedelic introspective headspace, but I can also appreciate the best numbness and comfort in my body, how great food tastes and how good music sounds, and how easy it is to fall asleep now.

Here's what I've learned.,"A few days ago, I hit 7 months clean. It's been a shitty ride, and I still have nightmares about narcan and I still get a half-chub at the thought of picking up a dime bag.

I thought I would post a few comments I think could help others going through the struggle. I've discovered so much about recovery from this sub, and I hope I can add to the pile.

1) *Leave your significant other you used with.* It hurts recovery and they will hold a grudge against you for getting clean before they are ready. You'll be guilt-tripped and blamed for every drug they use. This is common advice, but I discovered I am no exception.

2) *Avoid people who will claim you were* ***only*** *able to stay clean because of them.* Their words will become a self-fulfilling prophecy, but you'll discover you can survive without them very quickly. People who take credit for your recovery as if it was a section of their résumé are toxic and selfish. Although it is okay to rely on friends, only **you** can keep yourself clean! Give yourself twice the credit you give anyone else. If someone is truly helping you stay clean, they won't ever make you feel guilty for it. Sponsors, families, friends and the internet are a support group, but none of them have control over your mind.

3) *Rely on more than just meetings.* I've gone to meetings in 7 different states now, and they vary so much they might as well be separate organizations. My home group is centered around positive thoughts, but a group I visited 30 miles away was a giant guilt trip. Find a vibe you enjoy, and surround yourself with similar people. Don't let any group convince you that you will always need a certain fellowship to be clean; you may need a certain feeling or environment, but the 12 steps feel different everywhere.

4) *Don't be afraid to rejoin society.* Although legal problems and broken relationships fucking suck, they aren't the end of the world. Rehab told me I was some sort of outcast. It was implied I am different from other humans, as if I was a permanent burden. When the dust settles, you are more than an opiate addict. You're a being with thoughts, problems, and emotions like the rest of us. Don't punish yourself more than you have to. Reflection is okay, but self-inflicted isolation isn't. Never let the only reason you don't seize a great opportunity be your addiction.

5) *Ego is dangerous, but self-respect is essential.* You've been through hell. We all understand the struggle. When the super-suit finally comes off and you enter the hell that is sobriety, you may find your ego was your enemy. Maybe you had no ego and no self-confidence. These scenarios are obviously bad, but neither warrants self–hatred. Appreciate your past, and know you deserve respect for every second you are clean.

6) *Don't think you have to follow a specific path to recovery.* No two people are the same. John was able to quit cold turkey, but Jack may require 2 months of subs. Fish oil works for some, masturbation is enough for others. If someone tells you ""you have to do x or be around y to stay clean,"" take it with a grain of salt. Advice is cool, but there are endless ways to get clean. After rehab, jail, or quitting without the former, long-term recovery is an individual effort. Take time to discover what works best for you.

7) *If a treatment facility staff member insists you need to spend far more time in treatment (translation: pay them more money) to stay clean, promptly tell him or her to go to hell and leave.* I quit outpatient and pissed off the treatment facility. They made it extremely difficult to quit, and told me I wouldn't make it 30 days unless I stayed for 3 more weeks. Treatment is cool and all, but they're running a business. There's incentive for you to stay longer and keep coming back. I'm not saying treatment is bad, but don't spend your life savings on it. There are tons of free ways to stay clean once you get through detox and/or inpatient.

8) *Your friends who didn't use will never understand, but don't hate them for trying to.* At first, I hated when people would try to sympathize with me by explaining how they made it through their parents divorce. Yes, opiate addiction is far worse than most things people can imagine. Yes, it can be extremely irritating when non-addicts try to see the world through our eyes. Several months in, I learned to appreciate these conversations as a person's attempt to put me on a level playing field with society. If they see me not as an addict, but as a person struggling with a difficult time, it means they don't see me as an outcast.

9) *Changing people, places, and things helps; but isn't required.* You can stay clean if you live in the same town, have the same friends, or have the same routine without drugs.  Many people will tell you sobriety is *literally impossible* without changing said circumstances. However, in my opinion (and experience), changing all but one doesn't make being clean any more difficult. I would still **highly** recommend you change all three... but I wouldn't insist your recovery to be fruitless if you lived in the same city. Everyone is different–so individual results will vary–but don't give up if you still have to live in the same town as your dealer.

10) *In some ways, it never gets easier.* Never let anyone convince you everything will be as if you never used before. Recovery is an uphill battle, and the valley below isn't going anywhere. Don't let this discourage you from trying! Give yourself a pat on the back for every moment you stay clean. Just remember, opiates will always haunt us.

These are obviously just my opinions, and someone could disagree with everything I said and deserve equal credit. Never take anything I said here as a fact; just food for thought. 

Thank you, /r/opiates. You deserve more credit for my recovery than any treatment center ever will.",1504674537.0

Even if someone has a god amount of clean time if they tell another person who has never had addiction to substances will change their perception towards you. Only tell those who you trust and know they won't judge you. Even then depending on who you tell, that person may end up spreading the news to other people in your social circle.

My girl decided to tell a close friend of her's who battles substance abuse about taking some drugs, who in turn he told his wife and then his wife told her good friend. Her friend has never done drugs other than alcohol and weed. Now my girl has been seeking professional help but has to deal with the added stress of her friend interrogating her and upset about why she didn't tell her. 

It would be nice if people could share their addiction problems with other for support. However I have read on this board before and from my own personal experience once you come out and tell someone you are addicted and struggling to stay clean, that even with clean time if you happen to have an off day they will automatically judge you and think you are under the influence.

Same brother who i got H from for my first time 9 years ago(at least back then the dope was actually good and real) Things are different now. why third string you ask. well first of all, we live in different cities in VA, and from what i can tell, his area is absolutely filled with fent bullshit. But I can understand that. If it were just that it wouldnt be so bad. 

But where it gets bad is to see that when it comes to dope, even blood isn't important when it comes to addiction(Duh, i guess?) So whenever im desperate enough to go through him, i try to make it clear, i don't mind paying more, just please give me the best quality you can(basically "" i know you need to make something out of this even though im your brother, but please don't cut my shit anymore than it already is"") but no. in the end, i still pay a premium for said dope, and he dips into my bag significantly and replaces it with cut. which before he didn't even go through the trouble of replacing it with cut, so i *politely* made it the protocol that whenever we do anything we throw it on the scale ""just to double check""

even the last time i did this, i had made it clear that i wasn't interested any sort of fent being passed off as dope. in this area like many others, you can pretty much assume if its white, its fent.  not fent and dope, just fent. and sure enough what i get it solid white, clearly fent.

good thing is i don't have to be strung along waiting, as i can just go sit and wait at my moms house. however, even with that, when he goes and says hes gonna be back in 15 or 20 minutes, it might be 3 hours.

so in conclusion, all these complaints apply even if its your own brother ",1504666167.0

I may fail. Maybe I'll succeed. All I know is one day these scripts will dry up and I'll be done.

The other day I complained about ordering fifteen bags and the middle taking three. Well, my friend ordered the fifteen bags but I take care of him when he's down so of course he had to throw me something. Anyway, got this one comment where someone said, (paraphrased) ""ur complaining they took 3 out of 15, you could've gotten none."" 

&nbsp;

Well, last night before I got off work my boy was ordering a single bun and he denied the nigga, was like ""I want to give you 2, not 3 out of this bun."" So the middle is like, ""In that case I can't get it now at 8, but have to wait till after 10:30 when work is over.""

Of course that morphs to 11:30, then a couple of phone calls between then and 12:30 conclude that he's waiting for a delivery and that could be as late as 1:30 (or 2 for fuck sake). So I go home, my friend says he'll text me the minute gets delivery. I sit up til 2am listening to an audio book before going to bed. I probably should've taken some xanax to sleep since I had some on me, but I already took one earlier that day and I didn't like the way it made me feel during the day. 

&nbsp;

I have a weird WD sleep routine. I go to bed, then wake up a few times a night. Each time my shirt is soaked in sweat. So I toss it on the floor, and put a dry one on. From there I check my sheets, if the bottom most sheet is soaked, I swap it out. Then sleep again, wake up and repeat. The sheet from before usually has time to dry out so I'm able to just swap the sheets. If I run out of dry clean shirts, I'll just rotate to one that has had time to dry on it's own. 

As for the contour sheet, I just put a towel over it. Same with my pillow because you can only soak and rotate a pillow twice or so.

&nbsp;

Can't find the Kratom I bought, not that I'm crazy about it. **I did however take one clonidine, should I take another?**

On a side note, my friend just texted me. He did indeed make it to his doctor's appt this morning, despite being in WD he got in and out and now we're set for the fill date later in the week. Now I just hope he gets some boy before I go in for my evening shift and at the very very least I get the triumphant message while I'm at work that he's got it. 

&nbsp;

I woke up early yesterday when I otherwise didn't have to in order to pick up my friend's xanax script. He said this would help me because he could flip a bit of it and throw me some boy. I wait all fucking day yesterday only to wake up the following day still fucking waiting. 

The saving grace being that I've felt shittier before. Some times I've felt so shitty that I thought I must've gotten some fent laced garbage. That or did too much in a short span of time before running dry.

P.S.- After pay day I gotta buy some fucking lope and pepto. Then I gotta make sure I don't share it outside of my immediate family, what's the point? Maybe my friend remembered me giving him lope and gave me a free bag of dope once or twice weeks after.

P.P.S- I should probably go back to shitposting in the fluff subs.

My boyfriend had been 2 years clean from heroin and maintained on the suboxone program. I was prescribed Percocet for a back injury, as well grab it  recreationally sometimes. I made the mistake of giving him some one day when he pulled a muscle after work. 

For the next two weeks he proceeded to sell all his suboxone and sniff and shoot 3-6 bags a day behind my back. He was not nodding out and disposed of all evidence; I never would've known if I hadent spotted an injection point on his arm. His eyes are dark (hard to see pinned pupils), he never nodded around me, and since he's covered in tattoos- the marks are hard to spot. Any other signs you can recommend keeping an eye out for? 

We threw out the syringes I found after finding the marks. He deleted all drug contacts (to my knowledge), gave me control of his $, and offered to provide reciepts for purchases as well as download an app to let me see everything in his phone- texts, calls, location etc (I refused I felt that was too invasive). Are there any other things I can do that you found helped in your recovery; although, I realize everyone is different, and he has to do it for himself -I can't do it for him. As well, I did get rid of my script, realize I cannot use anymore, and am at the Dr. With him today so he can get more suboxone. 

Previously, I had told him I would leave him if he reverted back to using heroin; that's why he says he was scared to tell me. However, shooting heroin is like a death sentence to me I've had many friends die from that. I encouraged him to come to me so I could help in the future if he slips up. He lost his 17 year relationship and three kids to his previous drug usage l; his son found one of his bags of dope and tried it, said he wanted to try what his dad loved so much- he was 15 at the time. Also, bf was locked up 5 times in 7 years. He assures me it's different this time, but if the drugs consumed him to that point before i worry it won't be any different- and I'll wake up one morning to him dead next to me. 

So I guess I'm asking for signs to watch for, stuff/coping skills that helped you stay clean, and the best approach I can take in order to help him. Thanks for your help! ",1504630797.0

I'm a recovered opiate addict. I gave up in August last year and had one relase of 30mg oycodone in March, which didn't do anything but i was unwilling to take more oxycodone.
I am scared to go to my GP. I went for an ultrasound last year because of a suspected fibroid which came back negative. The reason the doctor sent me was because I could not empty my bladder properly but luckily the ultrasound came back negative, however, I still cannot empty my bladder properly. I get uti's and I feel a dragging sensation in my lady channel, sorry for all the information.
I think I have a prolapse, something is definitely not right. My urine is not infected, it smells normal and looks normal but the stream is very weak and it takes three or four goes to complete a visit to the toilet.
Anyway, I read in a few places that prolapses usually end up needing surgery to repair the weakened pelvic floor muscles.
I am perimenopausal and this is also an aggrevating factor for prolapses.
The problem is, not only will I need post operative narcotic pain releif, but I've read in a few places that i will need prescription strength painkillers for 1-2 weeks afterwards, and to complicate things, I Cannot take NSAID's. I can only take paracetamol or acetaminophen as its called in some countries.
In my country, prescription strength painkilllers means opiates, and I obviouslly don't want to become addicted to opiates again.
I spoke to a nurse on the phone, and she said that you cannot become addicted to opiates if you are taking them for pain, but I somehow don't believe this, especially as I have already been addicted.
She thinks I should visit my doctor but I am scared, because I don't want my fears of prolapse confirming.
I don't know, as an ex opiate addict, who does not want to be readdicted to opiates, to do with regards to post operative pain rellief and prescription opiate painkillers after the operation.
I know no operation is planned but if you read about prolapses, most of them end up needing surgery and you hear of loads of reccovered opiate addicts getting re-addicted to opiates after surgery, and ending up back on the drug with the monkey on their back again.
Any help would be greately received, thanks

Came here because I know you guys will be able to help me out, I know this may well be stupid but I'd rather be safe than sorry and this has been concerning me!  


Bit of background, I'm a (recovering) meth user and an irregular IV user of various substances, recently I went through a period of frequent IV MDMA use and am freaking out a little bit (though I may well be working myself into a panic). I'm unable to doctor myself due to my ridiculously shakey hands and had a friend of mine who's very experienced with IV use administering my shots over said period.  


I made a very very stupid decision while rolling dicks to try doctoring myself as I was alone and must have tried over 10 times to register with no luck, pretty sure I poked around my veins a bit too much and am worried I may have caused some damage. I've noticed some discoloration and have had mild pain located at the injection sites for the last 36-48 hours.I'm probably a pussy and all is well but I would greatly appreciate some insight from more experienced IV users! Please do not make the same mistakes as I have as they're very very stupid.  


Thank you so much everyone this is a wonderful community that has helped me out a lot, I'm incredibly thankful havens such as this exist for people in our positions.

Love to all !

Opiates work really well for this purpose, once I take a few pills I can go about my usual daily activities without pain.


But the thing is… it feels good to be on opiates, so once I have that first pill I always pop a few more and get a buzz going. I tell myself that i’m a legitimate user of opiates, and i’m only taking them when i’m actually in pain, but I always take way more than I need to kill the pain. Also, once I start taking them I keep popping them for the entire day, even though the headaches only last for 3-4 hours.


The thing is, i’ve actually started looking forward to getting these headaches. Sometimes I look at my medication cabinet and think “Dahm I haven’t had a severe headache in over a month now”. What kind of idiot wishes pain upon themselves so they have an excuse to get high?


This has been going on for about 5 years now, and although my headaches haven’t become more frequent I do find lately i’ve been getting way more fucked up. Normally when I wake up with a headache the first thing I do is roll over a pop some Codeine, about 60mg. I quickly follow this with 200mg of Tramamdol, before calling in sick to work. I then make a big pot of coffee and after drinking it I start to snort 5-10mg lines of Oxycodone, which continues throughout the day until I go to sleep. Keep in mind that i’m only doing this a maximum of once every 2 weeks so I don’t have much of a tolerance and this makes me really fucked up. I used to be happy just from the codeine, and then just from the codeine and tramadol, but for about a year now i’ve been adding increasing amounts of Oxy.


I’ve found that increasing dosages has made the next day feel worse. A few years ago i’d get high and then the next day i’d be back at work. Now I need to take 2 days off work, the first because of the headache and the second day to recover from the opiates.


Yesterday I had a headache and got the most fucked up i’ve ever been. I probably snorted almost 80mg of oxy by the time I fell unconscious. I feel like absolute shit right now, filled with unexplainable rage, depressed, and anxious. I started an argument with my wife for no reason, and then to make matters worse she brought me breakfast in bed and apologised for not being more understanding that I was sick. So now i’m angry at myself for being such a shitty husband as well, and feeling guilty that she is being so caring when I don’t deserve any sympathy.


What’s even worse is that for the first time in my life i’m having a comedown headache from the opiates themselves. I can tell because i’ve never had a headache where the pain wasn’t coming from my neck before, this feels like a classic Google description of a migraine or tension headache brought on by drug abuse.


The urge to pop another pill is strong right now. I’ve never gotten high two days in a row before though, but I do have a headache. I need some life advice, or for someone to tell me i’m a fucking idiot who needs to get his shit together.


Sorry for the long post, i’m in a weird state of mind today.",1504755498.0

I need/want to get clean now and I'm absolutely terrified.  I can't do detox or rehab and I don't want to get fired from my job for missing too much(although I can take some days off).  

Last week I impulsively decided to get on a methadone maintenance program but continued using(maybe even slightly more than usual).  My last 3 doses of methadone have been 60 mg but I skipped a day in between.  I've only dosed 4 of the 7 days.  I decided that I don't want to be stuck on methadone and rather do a sub taper.  I have access to a bunch of 8mg strips and I can get maybe 5 days off from any kind of obligations.  I feel that I should wait at minimum 72 hours from my last methadone dose(which was today) to take my sub induction dose.  

I've only been taking the methadone for less than 7 days but I'm terrified of PWD.  Should I wait longer than 72 hours?  I'll be trying to taper down my h dose until then(if I can).  I'm also thinking that I should change my ROA to make the sub induction more bearable as well.  I feel that it's now or never for me.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Each of the guilds has its own walled enclave in central London with libraries, great halls for our feasts and moots and a chapel, and many barristers offices. [This here](https://www.uniquevenuesoflondon.co.uk/sites/default/files/cover/right%20hand%20side.jpg) is the great hall and library of Lincoln's Inn. The guilds are almost like a hogwarts for lawyers. Anyway... circuitous story...

I had a great day in court today. I absolutely demolished a witness called by the other side, I was kicking him around the courtroom, figuratively-speaking. It's one of the most enjoyable feelings in the world when you are in complete control of your cross-examination, you've mastered the brief and you have the witness on the run.

The other great feeling is IV junk. I ordered some stuff online from a DNM, when I got home today I had a lovely NDD package waiting for me.

So I am an anxious person, always have been and only started treatment at the beginning of 2017 for my anxiety. Ive been on meds since and made incredible progress throughout the year with therapy, exercise and meditation. Mindfullness is incredible. I went from believing I would need to end my life in january to almost complete acceptance of my dissociative anxiety, which even gave me a new appreciation for the gift that is the experience we are granted. My strange experiences which felt like more than an anxious mind were now the fruit of an awe filled view of the world.

**Drugs**

Throughout last year I indulged heavily in marijuana, alcohol and MDMA and boy was it fun. It was clear however that my consequent downfall into the depths of my anxiety had been assisted by this serotonergic drain on my mind. I ceased all substance abuse until about 6 weeks ago. Part of what tore me apart during this period last year was the shame and guilt of what I may have done to myself and feeling this secret burden without feeling able to discuss it with my parents. During my downward spiral I would inevitably tell my family about everything and the consequently complete honesty about all my anxieties in the next 7 months felt like the biggest weight had been removed from my shoulders.

**Opiates**

With a previously kindled interest and indulgence in recreational substance use getting high is something I would time to time feel a desire for emerge. I couldnt use stimulants and was now fearful of their blatant impact on the mind and chemical equilibrium. **Enter opiates**; I found a few old and unused morphine suppositories in a relative's bathroom and thought what the heck. Used about 5mg worth with zero expectations and before I knew it I was feeling strangely excellent! No comedown, no significant psychoactivity to fear, just a mellow euphoria that made everything nice and cozy. Fast forward a month and I had consequently experimented with codeine about once a week and found it similarly enjoyable. Two weeks ago I discovered the magnificent euphoria of a 300mg dose and dosed once a day for three days. I wanted more. Through a connect I managed to score 280mg of oxycodone in oxy/naloxone combination. 5 days after the 3 day codeine stint I spent a week going through all that oxycodone (in the oral ROA; the only one viable given the naloxone) and around 1g of codeine. Was it enjoyable? Yes. But not as much as I was expecting! (Maybe due to the naloxone having a small degree of systemic activity orally at higher amounts).

This is where the regret begins. I had spent a few hundred dollars getting that oxy. I had also arguably abused opiates to a somewhat alarming extent in those last 2 weeks. I found my mind during this time often ruminating about the opiate high. After finishing all of my stash last weekend I ceased my use and experienced no withdrawal. 

**However**; in the process of researching the potential repurcussions of my binge I found anecdotes of individuals who had been addicted on opis and opiate ruminations plagued their existence. **This scared the shit out of me**. I know I dont have a habit and its unlikely this occurs to me but I nonetheless can relate to having ruminating thoughts about opiates during my binge. **What if I could now be plagued by opiate ruminations? What if these thoughts ruin my recently achieved awe and appreciation of the world? What the fuck have I done? Shame. Guilt. Regret. Hundreds of dollars spent and all I have to show for it is anxiety. I cant talk to my parents about this anxiety can I?? I see the disappointment and judgement on their faces.**

Any thoughts are appreciated. Fuck me these drugs are insidious, I arguably didnt do that much for not very long and yet they weigh on me so.

First post here but I've been lurking for awhile.  I have a history with substantial use of opiates, but I've been clean for a long time.  ""Good"" job (although I am absolutely miserable) and living on my own.  I got a prescription for 30 10/325 norcos a few months ago, and that reignited my love for opiates.  To the point to where I am almost fiending.  Opiates have always been my drug of choice.  

It's been about 9 years since the last time I've used heroin and I have been seriously considering trying to score on Craigslist for the past month or so.  I even called up a dboy and almost met up, but I called it off before we set up the meet.

Sorry for the shit post, I just needed to talk to someone about this.  My life is going ""well"" by societies standards but I am totally miserable, depressed, and lonely.  I've found myself romanticising drug use just like I used to all those years ago.  I have an urge to rebel, throw it all away, and say fuck everybody.  I have literally been having dreams of smoking tar, I miss it so bad, but I know everything I've worked for can get thrown away in an instant if I start using again.  A friend gave me just 20mgs of oxy a couple weeks ago, and right after I sucked that powder up my nose I was saying ""take it away, take it away...""  Then the most amazing feeling that I've missed so much.  All the fuck in my head just stops.  Emotional, as well as physical pain, ceases to exist.  I feel elated.  I feel relieved.  I feel like everything's gonna be okay.  Everything is just fine.

I'm looking for sincere opinions on a debate I'm having with someone.,"Hi all, it's been a minute. I was never a frequent poster in this community but I was definitely here on the daily and I spent a lot of time in the IRC chat. I hope you're all doing well and staying safe. 

I was in pain management for like 6 years. I was snorting anywhere from 80 to 120mg of oxy daily and cutting open 100mcg fent gel patches to smoke off of foil at the height of my usage. I've been out of pain management and off of opiates for almost 3 years now. I miss oxy but I needed to stop what I was doing before I overdosed and I firmly believe I was headed in that direction. I just wanted to give a little backstory before I ask my question. 

The debate I'm having revolves around marijuana legalization. I know there are many of you that started using opiates on a regular basis after being prescribed some variation of narcotic medication. 

I firmly believe that if marijuana was legalized on a medical or recreational level, the rate of opiate related deaths and the need for opiate addiction treatment would significantly decrease. I feel that there is huge number of people (not all of them, obviously) being prescribed opiates that would get significant relief from cannabis without the risk of addiction, overdose and severe health risks affiliated with narcotic medication. 

What do you guys think? Am I being naive? I know people are still going to use opiates regardless of whether or not marijuana is made readily available, but imo medicinal marijuana legalization would definitely affect the opioid epidemic in a positive way.",1504845331.0

I picked up a bun from my boy earlier today, pretty good shit. A guy I middle for hit me up and wanted 6 bags, so I meet him at a grocery store parking lot, get the cash and head to the spot to meet my boy. We swap vehicles because my tags are out of date and I don't need to give cops any reason to pull me over when I'm picking up if I can avoid it. 

So, I'm parked on the street waiting for the guy. He is taking his sweet time and it's a place I don't really care to be parked in. Ten minutes go by, then fifteen. Over this course of time two Town PD patrol vehicles pass me. I don't like that. 

I decide fuck this, we can meet somewhere else, too much heat. Boy, I didn't even know how right I was. I fire up the truck and head to the Dollar General around the corner to grab a lighter. As I'm pulling away from the meet up spot, I see the dboy drive down the street. 

Out of seemingly no where, a County Sheriff Patrol car is behind me. Well, here we go. As I'm pulling in to the Dollar General parking lot he blue lights me. 

I pull over, put my wallet in my hands, turn the engine off and put my hands at ten and two on the steering wheel. Cop 1 comes on up to my window and asks for my ID and reg. as Cop 2 shines a flashlight through the passenger window. He doesn't say anything but nods at me when we make eye contact. 

Enter Cop 3, Corporal McCockface. He introduces himself and tells me he's been watching me sit in the truck for about 15 minutes. He tells me that I am in a ""known drug area"" and that while he hasn't seen anyone come to serve me he is sure I'm there for drugs. I tell him this isn't the case, and when prompted, I feed him a BS story about going to meet a girl and just waiting there til she was off from work. He tells me this isn't his first day and that he thinks that is BS, but he makes clear he isn't doubting my integrity (wait, wut). 

He asks to search the car and I tell him I can't see why that would be necessary. I'd checked the truck for anything before I left and knew there were empty stamps and a cut straw in the center console. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Should've thrown those out. I tell him no. Cpl. McCockface laughs and says okay. 

To make an already long story a bit shorter, Corporal McCockface tells me this is my lucky day. He tells me no ticket for the brake light that is out, which prompted the stop (I checked later, it is out), and that'd he'd be keeping an eye out for me. K thx bro. 

Lessons learned: 

1. THROW AWAY YOUR FUCKING PARAPHERNALIA! That could've cost me a lot. 

2. Just say no! To the cops. If they ask to search the car, that means they haven't discovered probable cause to do so, and unless you give them permission, they won't be searching it. They could call a dog, in which case you're fucked. 

3. Make sure your vehicle has all the Ts crossed and all the Is dotted. 

4. If it feels wrong, it probably is. Listen to your gut. If you don't like it, something probably IS up. If you're lucky, you'll never find out if you were right or not. 

I met up with dboy later and got the bags, as well as my cut. Could've been a bad night for both of us had he served me while Cpl. McCockface was watching me sit there. ",1504837523.0

I'm just hoping to maybe get some individualized feedback.

So my oral surgeon told me that I needed my four wisdom teeth removed but that it was a ""no rush, at your next convenience"" situation. Well it's been two years haha. And it's time. They are starting to hurt and will need to come out before the end of the year. On top of the financial stress like finding time off work to get it done (I'm probably going to have to use all of my vacation time for the operation) I'm totally freakin' about how to handle anesthesia, post op pain mgmt, etc. I have pretty terrible dental phobia as it is... I mean to the point where I'll ask for sedation or take an extra klonopin for a simple routine cleaning. I'm now on 5.7mg/1.4mg of Zubsolv/day (so roughly 8mg bupe) as opposed to the 16mg/day I was taking for the longest time, so I guess that's good. But I feel like I'm gonna have to go off bupe for multiple days before the operation which because I'm a pussy I have a really hard time doing..  Even for just a day! If I don't dose within 2hrs upon waking, I start panicking and feel sick - it's kind of sad as I KNOW I'm freaking for no reason as I just had a dose the night before and am no where close to the awful shit. Even if I were able to push through multiple days w/o bupe I'm still afraid the anesthesia wouldn't be enough because of bupe's long ass half life...  When I relapsed awhile ago, even after a week and half of no bupe, I could take 100-200mg oxycodone and barely catch a nod. I'd even add another 50-100mg morphine and still didn't get high (granted multiple DNA swabs have shown that my body has a crazy hard time digesting morphine for some reason). Let me stop rambling and get to my main concerns:

A) I really don't want to go through multiple days in buprenorphine withdrawal (cuz I'm a big pussy and traumatized by going through bupe w/d in the past)

B) I have a hard time trusting that the ortho surgeon/anesthesiologists will know enough about longterm buprenorphine maintenance to appropriately handle my anesthesia and pain mgmt: pre-op, during the op AND post-op

C) I don't think the percocet or vicodin that's commonly prescribed after this surgery will do anything for me

D) I feel that the damn stigma around addiction will negatively affect these (for once, lol) LEGIT concerns surrounding this medical operation 

Any experiences, advice, and tips would be greatly appreciated! Sorry for rambling, it's what I do when I'm anxious.",1504835881.0

6yrom4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6yrom4/i_have_a_theory_about_chemical_addiction/,25,https://redd.it/6yrom4,Daveslaine,I have a theory about chemical addiction,"I've noticed that when you quit let's say oxy after long term use but withdraw with let's say kratom or hydrocodone it's 10 times easier. Let's say you use hydrocodone or kratom or even both for a maximum Of 3 days after your last oxy use, it's much easier to quit all of those cold turkey because your receptors haven't built dependance on them yet and when they stop receiving kratom or hydrocodone they revert back to endogenous opioids. I've always noticed this to be true. Whenever you quit cold turkey all your body wants is the same chemical you quit from. When you substitute with another (preferably weaker) opiate then it takes that and you still feel the effects but because it hasn't had long term addiction to it yet, it won't give you full blown withdrawals to them furthermore, your receptors assume that oxycodone is no longer what it will be receiving and even within 1 or 2 uses adapts to those chemicals but addiction takes time to build and therefore in my own experience, taking hydrocodone 1 day and kratom another day completely resets and throws the receptors off and you walk away from all oxy withdrawals basically and might barely feel any symptoms at all after you cold turkey your hydrocodone or kratom and then your back to feeling endogenous opioids.

I'm also convinced now that our own endogenous opioids aren't addictive and don't give us withdrawal because first, our body and brain releases them whenever it needs and second, I believe that the endogenous opioids in our body aren't always exactly the same.

I believe that our endogenous opioids always have the same ""key"" amino acid chain that identifies it as an ""opioid"" so it can attach to our mu opioid receptors, but the remaining amino acid chain differs each day and especially the more new experiences you go through or depending on your age or what you're doing, the amino acid chain in the endogenous opioid peptide is different from the day or week before which means that it's essentially a new chemical in your receptors therefore it overrides the previous endogenous opioid peptide tolerance from the day or week before and thus, your receptors adapt to the brand new amino acid sequence and you no longer have addiction to your previous endogenous opioids and also have a ""new"" high that is in tune with your state of being at that time.

This sequential chain is always in tune with who we are throughout life. I believe if you had extracted your endogenous opioids from 10 years ago in a syringe and somehow could inject it and feel it (I don't think it's possible but it's just an idea) then you'd feel the same feelings as you would have 10 years ago 

Remember, amino acid peptides and chains are far more complex than a simpler and always static chemical like hydrocodone or oxycodone or heroin.

My point is that, if you want to quit, try taking an opiate you've NEVER tried on your first day of quitting and something else the day after and finally loperamide and then go cold turkey. This is what I'm doing now.

I know I have no proof regarding the amino acid chain being different in endogenous opioids each time But I'm convinced they are and only a small portion of it stays the same so it is recognized as an endogenous opioid and can attach to the mu opioid receptors.",1504834440.0

Starting to think that I'll never find a way out.,"In HA meetings here (here being the capital of a southwestern state, it's the one with the big canyon), one of the traditional readings before every meeting is called A Way Out. I like the title. They're talking about a way out of heroin addiction but to me I also think about how heroin and other drugs have always been a way out for me. A way out of responsibility, angst, fear, boredom, low self-worth, lack of confidence, depression, sadness, anger.

I'm 26 years old. Most of my peers that I grew up with and went to high school and college with are doing okay. Some have great careers and lovely significant others. Some are rolling through life with mediocre jobs but at least they're not worthless junkies. Me, I dropped out of college in my last semester because I was strung out and I couldn't maintain. That was four years ago. Since then I've struggled to make an honest living. I'm a fuck up. A classic failure to launch junkie man-child.

Since 2014 I've bounced around from my parents' house, to friends' couches, to rehab, to sober living, to psych ward to halfway house. All along I was trying. Maybe not as hard as I could but I was trying. I've done steps, been to meetings, had sponsors, had sober friends, listened in treatment, found work. I always relapsed. The consequences were always inevitably homelessness. I'm not here to bitch about the state of recovery housing and the consequences of using. It is what it is. I get it.

But it's hard. Being homeless here is no joke. It's hot. There's not a lot of services. Most of them are overwhelmed with hope to die drunks and mentally-ill folks anyways. I'm young enough and not tore back enough to basically have to pull myself up by my own bootstraps.

So I don't know what to do. Every bridge has been burned. If not directly by me, simply because my friends and family don't want a junkie around. I get it. I don't deserve a second or third chance. 

I wish I could afford enough dope to overdose tonight. I'm so tired of this. There's no hope anymore. I used to power through days like these, either on a mission to get dope or to get sober again. But I just don't care right now. I'm sad. And I know that I don't deserve pity. I know it is up to me. I don't think I'm capable though. I don't think I can get better.

I lost an old friend to what I think was a suicide a couple weeks ago. I hadn't spoken to him in two years because I was too busy either getting high or not getting high. Now he's gone and his memorial is this Sunday. Chances are I won't make it because this phone won't have service and by then I probably won't have a place to sleep and shower by then.

I always figured the people I loved would be around whenever I got my shit together, that I would finally beat addiction and it would be like the end of Eastbound and Down when Kenny gets out of rehab and he's high fiving everyone. No, they won't be around for me. I'm not worth it.

If you read this, thanks for reading. I just wanted to spill my guts here. Hope everyone is safe and well tonight.",1504831828.0

6yqhwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6yqhwh/od_story_from_hong_kong/,36,https://redd.it/6yqhwh,45generationroman,OD Story from Hong Kong,"This is just a short story about a time me and my friend got high in Hong Kong and ended up in the ER.

My friend and I don't see each other very often, as she lives in Hong Kong and I used to live on the Mainland of China. Everytime we hang out though, we always score a few bags of China White, and very carefully snort small lines until we hit that nodding paradise. Usually, we get a room in this concrete jungle called Chungking mansions, with two very small beds, and enough room for a backpack and to get high together. 

However, this day I had been and copped us a few bags of China white and came to meet my buddy in a bar in Tsim Tsa Tsui, near where we had planned to stay. She had been hanging around with a guy all day, that she was trying to get with and had been drinking a lot, I guess for dutch courage, so when I arrived she was already pretty drunk. We hung out outside 711, drinking beer and she scored some weed from a Bangladeshi guy. Then we all decided to head to a nearby irish bar to get some drinks, where I slid a fresh bag and also an opened bag that I'd had a line from to my mate under the table. 

She went to the toilet and came back pretty fucked up, and it transpired she had snorted all of what was in the opened bag. This was around 0.2g, a whole lot more than we usually have at one time and started to get progressively more and more fucked up. Then the dude that she had been trying to get with tells me that she had eaten a bar of xanax earlier. She starts falling all over the place, so I take her outside for some fresh air, and the guy makes his excuses and leaves. I'm pretty high by this point too, but kinda sober up a bit when she is falling all over the place, and becoming incoherent. I was going to take her up to our room to sleep it off, but it was an elevator ride up to the 14th floor, pretty small elevator and really slow, so I didnt want to end up being trapped up there. 

I kinda half carried, half walked her back to the front of the 711 and gave her some water, at this point she was breathing heavily, nodding out constantly and  becoming pretty unresponsive. I had her sitting on this little wall and she just kept falling off. The Bangladeshi dealer and his mates were hanging around, telling me to 'Get this fucked up bitch out of here' and getting kind of aggressive.
 I had my mate in the recovery position now, and her breathing was getting more and more fucked up. I thought she was gonna fucking die in the street, so I called 999  to get an ambulance there.

Next thing I know her phone is ringing and its the bangladeshi dealer, telling me to get the hash off her and to keep my mouth shut. Then I hid my gear in my mouth, and went through her purse, pockets, everywhere. I couldn't find the hash, I found the full baggie, but couldnt find the other one anywhere. The police turn up before the ambulance does, and I tell them I think my friend is overdosing, they don't give much of a fuck and start to question me hard, to find out what she'd taken and where she got it.
Once the ambulance shows up, they ask me what shes taken, I said Xanax, alcohol, maybe opiates as I knew she used to use, but I couldn't be sure. We all get in the ambulance and head to the hospital, just before I get in I manage to get the  baggies from my mouth onto the road.

All the way to the hospital, the pigs aren't concerning themselves with anything other than trying to get something pinned on me or my buddy, they have her passport and are asking me all kinds of questions. Once we get there, the docs realise that she is having a heroin overdose and take her to the recovery room, where they stick her with Narcan, while the cops have me outside grilling me some more.

After about 30 mins, the docs come out, tell me she is concious and I begged to go in and see her, luckily the cops had gone to reception to do some paperwork. I get in and manage to talk to her, shes confused as hell, but I was able to get her to give me the rest of the drugs she had on her, which I promptly stuck in my ass. Then I was out talking to the police, who seemed to accept the story that she had just had too much alcohol and xanax, or they took pity on her when they saw the sorry state she was in and they gave me her passport back.

At this point I decided since she was fine and was basically gonna be in the recovery room, getting jagged with Narcon all night, that I was gonna get the fuck out of there and head back to my hotel.

 I jumped in a taxi and got out at the 711, looked around on the road and found my dope and headed back to my room. I got high as fuck, it was awesome. I guess we were pretty lucky that night, she didn't die, we didn't get arrested and I got my dope back. She ended up with around a $800 usd medical bill, which I thought she was gonna be mad about, but I'm pretty sure if I hadn't have called 999, she would have died.

Since then I pretty much stopped drinking, drinking + dope + benzos is a bad fucking idea",1504821850.0

I was supposed to get it last night, but you know how that goes and it ended up being this morning before work. The dude said do a little, this stuff is really strong. I had only done H two times before and each time it was stomped on therefore thinking my high tolerance transitioned to H as well. 

I could go on and on, and will if people are interested or ask but I'll save all the details in this post. 

Turns out it was PCP/meth and I have never used either one. It had to have some fent or another synthetic opiate in it cuz I passed out and died on my work desk. 

This all happened at 9 am and I woke up in the ambulance and was in the hospital by 10. They narcanned me and brought me back to life. If this isn't an eye opener, then I have no idea what would be. 

My mother and girlfriend are scared for me and want me to enter detox tomorrow. I'm pretty sure I'll go.

Enjoy.

After a couple months clean, I went on a little run last week. I'd been planning this for over a month--scheming to get a decent amount of cash through making incredibly frequent visits to my senile great-aunt who gives me money for car payments/tuition/haircuts/whatever she thinks I need whenever I see her, selling a bunch of my old shit I had in storage (mostly clothes and electronics), and my first addiction, shoplifting and flipping the goods I managed to get.

So here's my backstory/backdrop/circumstances. On paper, my life is fuckin' awesome. I have a super supportive family, my youngest sibling just started college and is killin' it and just makes me proud for being a kickass kid, I have a steady job, a new apartment with my best friend, and best of all, I got re-accepted at the university I started at six years ago. After a bunch of wayward years spent in and out of treatment and traveling around the Northeast and Cali, I've come full circle to finish my degree and start being a responsible, self-sufficient person.

And yet, something's missing. I don't know how much of it is the addiction, how much of it is just wanting to shoot dope all day, how much of it is enjoying the excitement of stealing and pawning and all that other degeneracy. My life looks amazing, right? I have everything everyone could ever want, and yet, I feel unfulfilled in a way I can't put my finger on.

This most recent run is really making me question why I'm feeling so fundamentally empty. After talking to my counselor about it yesterday, he straight up told me ""Bropi10U, you're being a fuckin' idiot. Your first thought once you finally get your shit together is 'well, time to go back to all the old habits that fucked me in the first place'? C'mon man, you know better. I'm not saying this to belittle you, I'm saying this because I think you can get your shit straight.""

And he's right--he's not coming down on me to get himself off, he just knows that he can be straight with me and I won't get butthurt or defensive about it. But what he said is really weighing on me. Why would I go out and get high again right after I got my shit together? 

I have every intention of using again after I get through a drug test with my sub doctor next week. That's the concerning part, I guess--that despite this good common-sense advice, I just kind of don't give a shit. I don't care about accomplishing anything, I'm just going through the motions because it makes others around me happy that I'm not letting life bend me over anymore. Truth be told I'd be entirely content to off myself if it wouldn't destroy my family. I just have no internal motivation to not do the same old shit.

Anyways guys, if anyone took the time to read this whole clusterfuck, thanks for doing so. I just needed to get this off my chest.

**TL;DR: I finally have my life back on track but I feel so compelled to keep getting high. I can't find happiness in the amazing things I'm blessed with and would trade them for dope in a heartbeat. If anyone has had similar experiences/advice I'd love to hear about it.**

Much love, fam.

i inform her that she is a mongolian cockfart and that if she doesn't mend her ways i will sell her to a chinese dick farm as slave labor for not letting a man sleep in for once. (i actually did say this verbatim coming out of a sound sleep.) a good 20 minutes later or so as i am out smoking on the porch and wondering how and why it is that i am so massively intoxicated. gradually i come to remember what i thought was a modest mix of the best of the Andes and the grand old Golden Crescent and realize that i had definitely od'ed and fallen out and if it weren't for my cat being greedy and trying to get her breakfast early, that the amount of persian genie jizz i alchemied together with the aforemetioned peruvian tittysprinkles was firmly within the realms of  lethal.

so in order to assure i remain awake, i did a pretty good sized amount of solid peruvian without the addition of that particularly powerful sassanid sleep sauce and promptly ejected what looked to be enough beef stew to feed Xerxes' entire Anti-Byzantine Army Soup Kitchen with enough left over for him to turn around and poison the household staff of the Patriarch of the Byzantine Church of all Asia Minor. In other words, I had an epic vomit session,  

In conclusion, wow. If it werent for my little 17 year old bitchypoof i probably would not have woken up today, period. Here's to you, George kitty.

I squint at her from bed. ""I'm going to go to the doctor when the clinic opens."" She smiles at me and nods; the smile is genuine. She loves me and wants me to get better. Not a minute passes after the squeak of the front door as she leaves before I'm hovering over tinfoil and a cold-copped lottery of mood stabilizer.


I fall back asleep until roughly an hour after the clinic opens, and its only a 5 minutes walk from my front door. I make my way to the front desk and toss my name in the hat; I have 2 hours to kill, ""at least,"" before I am seen by a doctor I have never met before. I am cautiously hopeful, and know that I need help, but I am also aware this is just the first step towards actually getting medical care relating to my addiction. This appointment is not going to make me feel better physically.


I promised yesterday to meet my friend/downtown plug at noon today, he's slinging literally hot pink dope, he gives me a solid amount in $20 increments, and it makes me as ""not sick"" as my ultra-reliable, preferred client delivery service. I can only call him when I have enough money to not embarrass myself (at least $100) although I've spent enough tens of thousands of dollars with this upper-class driver that he doesn't blink when on occasion I only want a $40 bag.


In any case, I told my downtown hustler that I wanted some hard too; he said he'd buy powder and cook us some up. He glances at me sideways: ""You're doing hard now?"" 


""Not on the regular. My old lady is going out of town for the weekend and I'm quitting everything. I quit."" I'm on the other side of 5 days of detox, and 2 days of mild relapse. I'm going to see the doctor, I'm being good.


I hit the bus and slide down to the strip with my face buried in a science-fiction novel. I've been voraciously devouring books lately. I'm depressed, and when I'm reading, I'm not thinking about being depressed. Its better than sleeping during every spare moment I have, in which the nightmares of withdrawal (or even cutting down) kind of negate the escapist qualities of a 14 hour nap.


My friend doesn't show. My plug: He has a bad habit of ending up in jail. I read for an hour, waiting, but there is no sign of him. I decide to wander and find my quarter of down, and a few rocks of hard from various randoms who vocalize their product: rock, side, down. I smoke a bit in an alley, maybe between the down and the hard I might look half-way presentable to my doctor. Perhaps not embarrassingly high. 


I find my way back to the walk in clinic, 1 hour and 50 minutes after their ""2 hours, at least"" estimate. I have missed my train, but they put me right back on the list. The receptionist explains that two doctors found themselves working simultaneously, as one had come in early, so they were ahead of schedule. Each government-run medical clinic has approximate hours, but they also have a specific hard-limit quota that allows them to close early should they reach their designated daily capacity.


I am called into the doctors office immediately; the doctors assistant looks over her shoulder and asks ""Does it matter which doctor you see?"" It does not, and I indicate as such. She leads me into a small examination room and gestures for me to sit down and wait for a doctor to come see me. She turns and leaves the room, allowing the door to glide partially closed behind her.


I look around the room, and place my hoodie under the chair that I presume I am meant to sit in. I am careful how I place it on the ground; my used pipe, a ""glass, straight"" for the hard I smoked earlier is firmly tucked in the furthest corner of one my pockets. I would be mortified if it fell out and revealed itself during my appointment.


The doctor soon enters the room, a fit, middle-aged Caucasian with glasses and a confident gait. He introduces himself; I do not remember his name. He immediately asks my name, to ""confirm my identity."" I've noticed during my lifetime that hospital visits include multiple identification fail-safes. I wonder what event(s) prompted these purposefully redundant procedural safeguards. I wonder if anyone has posed as another person to glean confidential medical information. Plausible; even probable.


""What can I do for you?"" the doctor asks. My body language mimics a kicked dog. It takes me 15 seconds to spit it out.


""I'm addicted to heroin. And I want to stop."" He shifts his weight and probably fixes his eyes on me. Or on his clipboard. I can't make eye contact with him.


""Are you an IV drug users? Do you snort it? Do you --""


""I smoke it."" I might have said 'just' smoke it. That's how I always say it in my head. That's how I admitted it to my girlfriend; out loud, anyways. I intend to let him lead the conversation; I couldn't tell my girlfriend quickly enough that I have never used IV drugs, that I use alone, and I have never even shared a pipe with anyone. I don't smoke heroin in a pipe, but its true I will not even share a hooter. Its more true that other than a handful of times in the last 2 years of daily use I have always been alone when I use. It was never social.


He continues his probing questions. When was the last  time I used? Today. How long have I been using? 2 years. What other drugs do you use? I hesitate ..


""I use weed.""

""And alcohol?""

""Yes, alcohol.""

""And what else?""

""Uhhhhh"" I'm literally stuttering over admitting to using other drugs. I think I am more embarrassed about using crack than heroin.


""What drugs have you used in the last week?""


""Heroin, a bit of cocaine, by chance, this week. Its not really my thing. I smoke marijuana and drink sometimes too.""


He is taking notes. One of the main reasons I did not seek treatment earlier, among my stubborn lack of self-awareness, is that I cross the border frequently to play in my band and I know that the US government has access to medical records. They have denied entry to persons who have been committed to psychiatric/mental healthy emergency institutions. I don't care about that anymore, I just don't want to be sick anymore. If that means I can never go to the USA ever again, its a small price to pay to get off of heroin for good. To just feel fucking normal.


The doctor does not waste any time declaring that he is unable to prescribe replacement therapy drugs like methadone. I look up at him. ""I know. I have tried Suboxone on my own as a quick taper. I have been using daily for 2 years, minus multiple attempts at home detox. Detox is not even that bad, honestly. I--"" He gently cuts me off, he is taking control of the conversation again, and I appreciate it.


""What did you want from this appointment?"" I appreciate his bluntness, and despite his open-ended question, he has refocused my thoughts. 


""My expectation is that you will refer me to an addictions specialist."" He nods approvingly. I can tell he is relieved that he is not about to be ruining patently unrealistic expectations from my side. I am not going to make a scene. I can only imagine how an IV drug user tipping the COWS scale stumbling into his office expecting sampler doses of methadone, or a Xanax prescription to put them in a medical coma for a week so they can sleep through detox. If I had enough money to pull that together on the street I would just buy another quarter. 


Make no mistake, I am here because I am desperate. My life is falling apart. I have missed 2 days of work this pay period because I was too weak to stand up on day 2 and 3 of my financially imposed detox. 


""I can give you some Naltrexone, it curbs cravings. It is normally used for alcohol."" 


My girlfriend recently moved in with me. She knows I have struggled with drug addiction, but thinks I am clean. She was in denial on some fundamental level, I told her I was detoxing from Suboxone. I was still trying to kick heroin, and not succeeding. She has stuck by me through multiple relapses and doesn't hold it against me. I've never stolen. I don't hang out with sketchy people or bring them around the house. I don't disappear inexplicably. I've never overdosed. Up until recently I was able to hide it really well from her, but there has to be a certain level of illogical denial to act surprised when you ""find out"" your boyfriend who you share a bed with every night has been on heroin 24/7 for months. 


""Firstly, I want you to go to the safe injection site downtown and get a Naloxone kit, and get trained.""


""I use alone. Who would I use that on? I can't give myself an anti-overdose injection if I am the one overdosing."" There is no way to say that without it sounding accusatory. The look on his face is genuine sadness, I think. He actually says ""Maybe, if you are starting to feel more tired than normal .."" and he trails off. We look at each other. He's a doctor, and I am sure that at least some part of him is a doctor because he wants to help people. And he knows how fucking hopeless it is.


""It a war-zone out there. Its been declared a health emergency by the government. I know I should go get a kit. Its a good idea. I will do it.""


This conversation is not going to get any easier for either of us from this point on. We are looking at each other now. I actually tell him ""I know you want to help me. I know you're a doctor, that's what doctors want to do."" Tears have started welling up in my eyes. I have cried a lot the last 2 days. I cried last night when I told my band what's wrong with me. Why I'm sick. I told them I'm going to the doctor today, and I just need some time. Its not the first time I have asked them for this, but I always just told them I was sick, or depressed. Both those things are true, so it was a good way to be able to look them in the eye and-


I find some Kleenex. I'm holding it up to my eyes. I want to finish this conversation as quickly as possible.


""I need help. I want to stop but I am physically too weak to hold down my job if I stop. I just missed 2 days of work. I can't keep doing this. I need help fast or I'm going to end up in the gutter. I'm going to be homeless.""


""Does your work have extended medical?""


""Yes."" 


""They might pay for your detox. They might pay for your rehab. They can't fire you for this."" I have perused the options available to me through my extended medical. Its going to make my countries already-heavily-subsidized replacement therapy even cheaper; but the potentiality for them figuring out what I am doing, however remote (realistically non-existent) isn't worth it. If I save less than an hours wage a month for filling out a form, that's not worth it to me. I don't get out of bed for less than $20 an hour.


""So is the phone number on file for you correct?""


""I haven't had a phone for 6 months. I can ask my girlfriend if I can use hers. She knows what's up."" She might leave me. I love her so much. I want to marry her. I don't want to be with anyone else. Ever. ""But she might be gone. I don't know. Can you please contact me via email?""


""Its a new system. Its designed to allow for email correspondence."" His brow is furrowed. He trips over his words for a bit, but communicates to me that he is unsure if they will actually reach out to me via email. I tell him I will 
try and get a phone number and bring it by the office. 


""How long should I wait to pro-actively follow up with you regarding an appointment with the addictions specialist, if I do not hear anything? What time frame am I looking at?""


He is reluctant to tell me outright. He slowly explains, ""Well, the last person I referred came in on July 17th, and we got an appointment on August 30th.""


""I can't... I..."" I can't afford to stay well. I can't afford to be sick. I can't deal with finding a new place to live. I can't go to work when I am withdrawing. I can't afford to miss any work. I can't do this anymore.


""I'm going to put a note on the request that its urgent.""


I smile at him. I'm still crying. ""Its urgent for everyone. People are dying out here. There's too many of us and not enough doctors. Thank you. I mean it. I know you want to help me. Is that it?""


""That's it."" He gives me a genuine handshake. It means good luck, I think. I need help but we both know its too late. I am going to have to do this without help from doctors.",1504957649.0

What goes into the classification of a drug as a ""narcotic"" that the police have to go after , and arrest people that use or distribute or sell a particular thing that is not on the US market over the counter?



Why is DXM and Diphenhydramine not a prescription narcotic?
Why is Loperamide not a narcotic?
Why is ____ not a Narcotic



**Annnnnnd i mean this is especially in the united states in america. most other countries INCLUDING CANADA are not as strict about drugs.**
inb4duerte


Please, other than things that people can easily OD on at a low dose like fent , cocaine, and extreme-high potency opiates**keep that out of the conversation**. That is obviously something that is a narcotic and kills people easily. I don't think that just because a drug has the potential to kill someone that it should be classified as a narcotic.



Pabla's final thought: The things that are helpful are made hard to acquire because they are the things that if used correctly will actually help people and thus a lot of different types of professions (of jobs,companies,etc. ofc) start losing money.
 Its almost as if , they purposefully keep drugs illegal no matter what drug it is, because they ; are involved in the drug trade as well. If the US can be dominant over the worlds drugs, through third parties ; i.e. cia , the mafia, etc.

Everyone who ever met you loved you, Stella. You were just like your name, lattice ivory, an intricate creation that inspired anyone who took a glance at you. If asked to pick just one word, I think I’d call you wonder, because you were so shiny, your iridescent humanity, morality, and good reflected beams off of everything you touched. You were worthy of awe in the softest, most gentle way. The way a hummingbird sips nectar like whiskey out of a hibiscus flower, wings a blur, the lightest, most delicate, the swiftest flight with the most grace. 

I think you had a face like a ballerina, a modern day Athena- but no one cared for your looks anyway once they heard you speak. For within daily mundane conversations you somehow wove in fairy dust, you had a mind for which Nicolai Tesla would lust, you above anyone, anywhere, I knew I could trust. Still, I know that I can trust you.

We met in the sixth grade but really we became friends at a pool party on 4th of July. You borrowed my rainbow zebra bathing suit and we played hide and seek with some kids that were there. I remember how easily we got along, how well our personalities bounced off of each other, and the true genuineness of our laughter. So the 4th of July became the 31st, and we spent almost no time apart. With every all-nighter we pulled at your house and every time we snuck out of my window we’d pulled the screen off we grew closer, I learned another secret of your heart, and our bond became more and more lovely and pure. I loved you more than I ever loved anyone, more than I think I will ever love anyone again. Every milestone in my life, every noteworthy day and unforgettable night- you were there. Nearly everything I did was for you, because of you, or to make you happy. You were my best friend, a better person than I ever believed could exist. You were unbelievable.

The hole in my life is bigger than my world ever was before. I am painfully aware of every cell in my body and every cloud in the sky. There is a literal physical ache in my chest, a weight that I do not have confidence will ever be lifted. The world is darker now, and somehow cold, I can’t believe I have to get older alone, I wish that could come home. You were the light in my dark world, and when I look into the mirror all the light is gone from my eyes. But I know I must not give up. I have to live life for the both of us now.

And so I will live for you, I will live in the ways that you taught me. After all, I wouldn’t be anywhere near who I am now if it weren’t for you. I have you to thank for so much, for everything good that I can remember. I will live fiercely, and without barriers. I will be brave like you, strong like you, graceful and speak melodiously with thought. I will question authority and stand up for what is good, true, just, and right. I will not cower in the face of adversity, rather I will stand tall against the rain. When faced with life’s challenges, I will look to the wisdom you taught me in the years I was your partner in crime, the thousands of days that where you had Stella, there was Zoe. I laid by your side more nights than anyone else in my life, and I know I will lay with you watching over me for an infinite number more. 

The thing that mattered most to you was the protection and well being of those you loved, and the very last thing we ever said to each other was that we loved one another, so there is some peace to be found in that.

My heart is broken, permanently so I think. My life will now have two very clear and different chapters: When I Had You and After I Lost You, and they will be different as night and day, dark and light, moon and sun. The color palette has changed from neon lights and pastel sunsets to grey and sepia tones. My voice will always carry a slight tune of melancholy, a small reflection of the sadness that I know will never leave my heart. You will never leave my heart, I will see your face at every corner I turn. I will think of you in everything I do, because we once did everything together. I will miss you in every way that I know possible, and several I haven’t learned yet. 

There is a hole that can never be filled, an emptiness in my life that I will have to learn to live with, and hopefully recover from, though I know there is a slim chance that any of us will ever fully recover from this.

Because this is an incomparable tragedy, a twist in the universe that should be made right, that never should have happened. This is a silent roar of the unexpected, the news that steals your ability to breathe or think upon hearing it. You made up so much of what I considered pure, kind and gentle and compassionate within this world. The sweetest note in your favorite love song, the princess who everyone in the kingdom loved more than any other. You were a princess who stood on her own two feet, followed her dreams and got what she wanted. Your absence serves as a grim reminder to all of us that even those filled with the most light and life can be gone within an instant.

I want so desperately to be selfish and beg you to haunt me, to stay behind me and with me even though you’re gone. But you deserve to be more than my ghost, you deserve to be the angel that you were here on Earth. 


There will not be anyone like you again. You were an uncut diamond, someone that was more precious than was believed to exist, someone whose worth had was an immeasurable wealth. Certainly in having been close to you I have known wealth, wonder and joy.

I have so many stories, a decade’s worth of happy memories and sunny days. I have your smile burnt into the atoms of my irises, I will never forget it. Of course I will never forget you, I couldn’t forget a thing about you. No one who knew you could. You were a friend to so many, and family to me. There is no other way to say this- the world is worse for you being gone from it, and that’s the way it always will be.

But are you really gone from it? They say that energy never dies, it just changes shape. So perhaps you are a daisy, a lion or a dove. Graceful and beautiful, the universal sign of love. You are a piece of me, my heart, mind, and soul. I am in turn, a piece of you. That’s the way that it works when someone is your soulmate.
So Goodnight moon, goodnight stars, goodnight Saturn, Jupiter, mars. Goodnight Stella, you will be missed. I say goodnight, and not goodbye, for I’m sure we’ll meet again. After all, you are my very best friend.

[TO ALL WHO READ ALL THE WAY THROUGH- 
I thank you. I believe it' important people know who she was, and how much pain her absence has left so many of us who knew here
BE CAREFUL]

So as I'm chilling whatching the sopranos I was catching a slight nod and I started hearing voices. Now I thought maybe it was something playing upstairs so I muted the TV and nothing was playing upstairs.

I unmuted the TV and started hearing the voices again so I muted it again and checked everywhere to see if something was playing but there was nothing. I kept the TV mutex and started hearing the voices more clearly in my head. I can't remember exactly what was said but at one point it wasn't just like indistinguishable crowd voices it was clear and I could hear the words. I should of wrote down what I was hearing but I was nodding in and out.

My question to you guys is has this ever happened to you? I know the dope isn't laced with a psychedelic because I just shot a bag and I'm not hearing anything out of the norm, but it happened in a higher dose. I should also mention the first 2 bags I did were a ""best buy"" stamp that was white-ish and pretty sure was fent but the voice didn't start until I shot the ""black shadow"" bags.

luckily this doesn't affect my ability to use a microscope, because the two eyes receive separate images and don't have to converge on a single focus. but if I'm seen squinting to read print others may question the strength of my eyesight, which I imagine would be 20/20 if the test wasn't biased against patients on heroin.

It's been a while since I've written 
I've been in a whirlwind of stress 
Anxiety intermittent 
Depressions been a constant 
And nodding  has  been a given 
And I'm burning Thru the  happiness 
That makes this life worth livin 

I've withdrawled into myself 
Built a wall around my mind
Emptied out my bank account 
""Sir your card has been declined "" 

No more color in my skin 
My constant sin blacks out  the shine 
My wits have met their end I'm tapping out 
Hoping I still have time

Time To turn this mess around 
And save my future while it waits for me 
But nothing waits for ever 
lately death is steady chasing me 

All while I'm chasing a high 
And never stop to look behind 
But I can feel the reaper reaching 
Out and leeching on my spine 

Feeding off my dopamine 
Begging me to make some more 
And the second I'm withdrawl in 
He insists that I go score some more 
Like just a little more , even just a little hit 
Is gonna solve the problems 
I was escaping when I first  fixed 

I know it's bullshit 
I hope to quit soon 
Mabey I could master how to chip 
And not be sick by noon 

But that's a lot of mabeys 
And lately that hasn't gotten me far 
But if we're going tit for tat
I haven't moved an inch on tar

I used to use a lot of oxy because of the (at the time) low price, they were amazing, I had extra cash. I mean you all know how it is. Now I know I've been heavily mentally addicted. I don't think I've experienced much wd sypmtoms luckily because I'd take a day or two off to use other substances or what have you. So never really knew physical addiction. 

My tolerance is naturally high, and it doesn't drop quickly. Obviously after having oxy for a while it was whatever I could get. Morphine is cheap. Dillauded. Opana. Poppy seed tea (potentially as bad as heroin in a lot of ways.) Subs, methadone, kratom, had most opiates real, synthetic, or somewhere in between. 

I'm not sure I specifically remember the first time I'd used heroin, I'm thinking it was sometime in the past year. Now this whole past year I've done well coming off of dependence on drugs. I managed to get to a state where I was not dependent while still recreationally using drugs. A big part if the change was change in environment and mindset. I wouldn't use to kill my negative emotions or to solve problems, as one does who is mentally addicted. I had been for years, but this past year I'd stopped and used to get high and feel good and have fun and be social with a friend or friends. Now the change in purpose I think did a lot. Now when I feel a negative emotion, I don't immediately think about getting high, because I've stopped conditioning my brain to want to get high everytime I feel bad. That was step 1 or 2 if you want to say one is admitting you have a problem or will if you don't change your habits. 

Now physical dependence doesn't currently exist for me, but you know there's times when luck is in your favor and you're given a bunch of near free dilauded and methadone, or you get a stash and it lasts longer than you'd think or you stretch your stash or whatever. I have experienced like cravings and runny noses, but that's about the extent of physical wd symptoms I've gotten this past year. 

I guess the point is that I feel a lot more in control now and I'm just happy about that. And I think having access to opiates and not doing them, training to have the power and ability to say no is amazing. And I think it really came from knowing how easy it was to get and make poppy seed tea, it was always available. Always. Never needed restocked or a script filled or what have you. Suddenly it was a matter of choice and Idk felt less novel or fleeting. The permanence of the option, the availability of it, and changing my mindset and why I used and when I used all helped me to feel a lot safer and in control. 

Compared to a year ago I feel way more in control, I'm happy about where my life is headed, and I'm not suicidal and depressed like I had been, and I don't feel like a slave to something. And I can still enjoy it and didn't have to give true euphoria, heaven on earth, up for good. 

Sorry for my ramblings everyone, I hope maybe it can help some people recognize what could possibly help them on their path to control. We just picked up and I can enjoy myself tonight as I do once or twice a week, and I hope you all enjoy your nights too. Oh and if I have a question about quality, color, possibly being cut or whatever, is there a specific place to post those questions?",1504909130.0

I have an extremely high tolerance to oxycodone (240-300mg daily, never get a nod anymore). Been at this dose for a few years now. I suffer from anxiety as well. I avoid benzos for the most part. However, I was recently given a large quantity of etizolam and can definitely use some relief from my anxiety on certain days. I will stay away from developing a huge etizolam tolerance (will not up my dose , will not take on consecutive days). I was wondering if people feel it would be safe for me to take at max 1mg of etizolam and 240mg oxycodone given my ridiculous tolerance. 

I would be doing this on occasion and will very strictly guard myself from going beyond 1mg etiz. Apparently etizolam is similar to xanax - I have successfully managed .5mg xanax with my oxy a few times in the past without any problems. I have heard Xanax is approximately twice as strong as etiz, hence my 1mg dosage cap. I Will take it earlier in the day so it wears off by the time I need to sleep.

it's just mind blowing how you lie back feels very symtoms fade away

And then the guilt sets in of how you're back to square 1.

the hardest part of addiction is when you're high and you know for a fact that the sickness is coming one way or another. no matter how rich you are there's no such thing as an endless supply.

sometimes I wish it would just kill me, it would make things a lot easier.

sometimes I sit and read conspiracy theories on the death of celebrities - and especially Kurt cobain.

every single comment about how he was Murdrred, I know for a fact that person has never been actively addicted to the devil that is heroin.

does anyone else agree that kurts death was heavily influenced by his constant battle with heroin, and how it rose to a $500 a day habbit. 

the only time I ever wanted to kill myself was 14 hours after my last hit, 100 degree fever with restless legs. 

i think Kurt knew he would never get off it. 
imagine having such a huge addiction mixed with such intense fame that the world knew you as a junkie scum loser, who nods out in front of his baby daughter who herself was born addicted because her mom was a junkie as well. can you imagine that shit?

I know this is a tangent, but that man killed himself, And addiction was a major factor ",1504896404.0

The process of designing a pattern, seeing how complicated I can get with it, then quietly sitting and stitching it all together while listening to music or watching a show has always been engaging, challenging, and therapeutic for me, and feels even better when I’ve got a solid buzz going in my opinion. Have pricked myself on the sewing needle a few times when I start slipping into a nod though lol

That's right y'all I got up did my morning routine of sticking stuff up my nose when I suddenly get a phone call asking me how soon can I be at the office for a drug test to start a job tonight. 

I have papers that I hope will buy me out of popping dirty for opiates so I said I can be to the office in about an hour. Now, here is the thing this paper has never been needed. I have taken 10 drug tests in the past 3 months for jobs and never ever failed even using my own piss and snorting shit right before. 

I'm not sure if I got some super crazy good luck or these drug tests don't test for heroin but they all say opiates?!? 

The stuff I've been getting I've been slightly worried it's cut with some kind of stim because I get wired like a mofo when I first do it. So today the drug test I sat in the bathroom a minute watching it change colours on the lines IDK how they fucking work but when I walked away from it the test was bright red for opiates and amphetamines. I went back to fill out more paperwork waiting on the dude to come over and tell me the dreaded news but instead he brought the info about the company I was going to and directions. 

This was the first company paid drug test I've taken in awhile so I kind of had this theory that if I was willing to piss in a cup they didn't care if I passed or failed because it was my money anyways and they just needed bodies in positions. 

But it being company paid today makes my theory mute. So I'm even more confused how I keep passing. 

Maybe I'm not really being sold dope? It's not fent, the legs are hella long and withdrawals are kinda dull for that to be the case. 

Got another free ice tester today and decided to spoil myself after the test so I'm starting to spin, so I'm rambling.

I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW I KEEP PASSING.DRUG TESTS!!! 

My mom failed only one for opiates and she has taken way more than me so WTF. Maybe my city really is so infested they don't give a fuck? Most places don't test for weed around me anymore even though I'm not in a legal state so I guess anything is possible. 

NEW JOB FUCK YEAH. 

I have a meeting with another temp service next week so I'll probably quit this job because fuck the pay. But a job is a job so I'm not being a snobby brat.

Our last convo he said he wanted to die. We would always mess around and say stuff like this. He asked the best way. I said 'rope'. Or jump off these couple of bridges. He asked if I wanted to come, which led me to believe he was joking. I don't know if he committed suicide. If he OD'd. On purpose. Accident. If I would've taken his statements more seriously, he would still be here. It's my fault. I've lost a lot of people over the past couple years...

Mainly the difference between cooking them vs using epson salt to break them down.

So I've been getting these yellows for a couple months now and after a friend showed me how he prepared them I have done a small amount of research. As of now I am preparing them with a Dremel, grinding them down to a very fine dust. I then dump that dust into the cooker and heat the bottom until a nice layer has melted and sticks the rest of the dust to that later. I do not heat it too much and I usually take my time in this process. I always stop applying heat when I noticed smoke or vapors coming off of the cooker once I hit the bottom layer I then carefully make sure that none of the dust inside is going to fall out and I turn the cooker upside down and slowly  heat the inside of the cooker to melt the top layer. I basically heat it until right before it's about to caramelize. I then add water heat to right before a boil and then  use the cover of my rig and thoroughly mix the solution, I add my cotton and draw it up. When done correctly the color is almost a green-ish tan-ish color. If the color is brown or really dark then usually that means I overcooked it but as long as it's not way too dark it will still be an affective shot.
I just recently read online, in a separate reddit post possibly, that someone has been doing a similar method to break these down. They use a Dremel to make it into a dust but then afterwords instead of heating they add magnesium sulfate(Epson salt) to the cooker with the dust add water and then mix it with out adding heat. In my experience is whenever adding water to the E40's they will gel up. They have now taken the E 40s off of the market and I'm down to my last fill of them.

I would like to get opinions from anyone that has experience with this specific manufacturer. I want to get the most out of the last of these.  So far every time I prepare one of these I get 2 to 3 separate sessions out of one E-40. But I also know that I am losing some amount of the active ingredient because I am adding heat. Has anyone compared the two techniques for prepping specifically and can say which they prefer.

About 6 months deep into my IV oxymorphone binge and as always, my infinitely nice and gracious parents want to throw me a birthday party (even knowing what a huge junky I had become). 

My birthday was just like any other day. Every day is the same as a junky. We love the routine of it. That's part of the allure. It is stability in a sense, even if a warped chemical dependent, pseudo-stable state. I had stayed awake till 3 or 4am the night before with plenty of oxymorphone for myself for once. Usually I'd do it all with my using buddies that evening, but tonight was special. It was already technically my birthday. I notice the change on the clock as I sit alone in my room with the door locked. I was sitting on the floor which was common for me then because I could easily hide the soda can with dope solution under the bed if anyone were to knock. However, my parents were sleeping soundly as always down the hall on the living room couch with dateline or something on the television for certain. The needle hidden directly in front of me, inside my houseshoe (what a great place for it...) was calling my name as I placed the toasted quarter of a pill on the bottom of it. It was 10mg oxymorphone total. It could be less if any was destroyed by the heat of the toaster. [Wow, i really had the balls to toast a pill in my kitchen with my parents asleep in the next room.] The solution looked like maple syrup and was similar in consistency too, as I mixed it around meticulously on top of the unopened Pepsi can. I'm not big on sugary soft drinks, but for this use they were nice. 

I glance up for a moment to Twin Peaks on my television. That theme song may as well be my anthemn for banging opana. I still can't listen to it without thinking about it. I'm on season 2 but by the time I made it that far in the show, my addiction made it difficult to even watch something. It's so hard to absorb a show through sound only and mostly closed eyes. 


[I never reached a stale point either. As my tolerance increased, so did my dose. I always got high, but the rush died down so much. It got to the point I'd prefer cocaine in the mornings waking up just to feel a rush. I'd hunt it down while dopesick and forget about opana until afterward. When that coke wore off though... Wow. Talk about hell. Luckily we were printing money during these days, so we would just pull over somewhere in Dillon's piece of shit Ford SUV somewhere to let him use my phone to fuck with his online accounts. I didn't question where he got the money from, and I couldn't say it if I even knew. I know sometimes we'd have to wait for him to call someone, proving info he was who he said he was.]


None of this is going through my brain at the moment. I'm fixated on the syringe in front of me with the faded numbers, as I finish mixing the dope up with the plunger. I take my time, cutting off a cigarette cotton with my razor blade, wetting it and applying it to the tip of my syringe, or just throwing it in the solution. Then I'd slowly pull back because my needle was already worn as fuck, thus it gave me great resistance. At last, 50 units of this syrupy goodness were inside. Normally, I would've sucked up the rest just for a real shot (even then I'd get no real rush as it wasn't the first of the day). However, today was my birthday, but most of all it was the day of my traditional family party. No way I could go without saving a wake up...

After falling into a chemically induced slumber for the usual 10-12 hours (weird for a junky i know but tonight i was very well medicated). Despite that fact I wake in the afternoon of the next day. The day of my birthday. The day I'd lose so much. I wasn't quite sick yet and chronically constipated. This still didnt stop me from immediately grabbing my preloaded rig from inside of my Finn and Jake houseshoe right next to the bed. I had an hour or two before my party started, and now was as good a time as any. I trudge my broken body into the bathroom, noting how the pretty and modern decor my mom furnished our home with didn't *pop* like usual. Everything was grey. I pull out the syringe from my pocket once the door is shut. My mom is preparing food inn the other room. ""Fuck!"" I think as i notice the bend in the tip. This would be a difficult one to register. 

I also cant help but notice the black solid particles floating around in the solution. That can't be good. Dan had once told me it was no good to save a shot for over a few hours once prepped. Made little sense to me, but maybe. I think little of what is going through my veins and more about what is going through my brain without this substance in them. I go for my easy spot, right on the side of the left wrist. Very dangerous but easy. I poke it and feel a hard sting from the dull, bent metal tooth. I was crucifying myself with a coffin nail. I see red finally after wiggling and poking it in and out a bit. I push down and... ahh. Relief again.

I walk out all glossy eyed and floating on my cloud.  Or not actually. The shot was a tease. My rush didnt truly hit. My asshole other self, the junky me, had taken most of the shot for his needs last night. I hsd forgotten totally until I walked out the door and still didnt feel the rush. It is usually very prevalent, feeling like the warmest headband you have ever worn is how it always began.

Time passes quickly, however, as my grandparents begin to show up at our home early for the 3pm party. Of course I had just woken up, done a shot in the room right next to them, and then still hugged and thanked them with scarred arms. I felt invincible and wore short sleeves. My family would never accuse me of something so vile as injecting pills like I do. I did it though, multiple times a day. It was my lifeline. It was my love and all I thought about.

 I'd meditate on my bed in the classic Buddha style. I'd go for 20 minutes, twice a day sometimes but usually slacked and did one. I would always do this after getting well of course. No time to sit around doing nothing without opiates lining my brain with goodness and contentment. (Even considering the quote: ""one should sit in meditation one hour every day. Unless you're busy.  Then sit two.""

Then something I had not considered yet happened: my old friends showed up. Now I had only been absent from their lives for the last few months, but it felt like an eternity to me. I was so selfish I forgot about them honestly. Dope made me into a piece of shit or maybe vice versa. 

We sit around my kitchen table eating cake and chik-fil-a chicken from a party platter. My mom really goes all out to make me happy even though she can't. Almost made me feel bad considering we are right where I had toasted some endo opana for my veins the night previous. We catch up and reminisce on old times, while I stare blankly at the wall, looking right past them and thinking of texting Dillon. I know I'm texting him already. They know it is my bday so I will have some cash. I glance down under the table at my phone. I open my textnow app used for burner shit and see my messages are blowing up already. Dan: ""wake ur ass up man it's time"".  Dillon: ""yo man wake up we need to use ur phone"" (except imagine way more retarded spelling). I reply to let them know it'll be soon. Meanwhile I'm faking smiles and attention to my real friends directly in front of me at the table who are eating my cake. I cant even enjoy food because I'm not fucking high yet. Im used to a NutriGrain bar only until late at night once i have enough chemicals in me.

Okay that's it. Let's get this ordeal over with. We've had enough fun. Granted at this point my party had been going on a whole 30-45 minutes. I was so ready to leave 30 minutes ago. My pseudo-rush held me for 15 maybe. I needed some cocaine too. 

So I mention some bullshit story to my mom about needing to go to my friends across town who she knows as my weed dealer. I figure at this point I cant hide it so I may as well toss the blame elsewhere to throw her off. Yeah I was shitty. This actually led to problems eventually, but that's another story entirely. She takes the hint and I begin with the opening of the money, i mean cards. 80$ score in total. The least I'd ever gotten from my whole family. They all knew where it was going. Don't ask me why they even me anything. My mom especially can never give up on me though and sometimes enables me but ah well. I even told them not to, even if I didn't mean it. 

Love is a confusing thing which makes us do less than rational things. Right then, I was in love with the rush of cocaine and oxymorphone. It was due to this same love for a rush that I hurried to say my thanks and goodbyes, and that I need to ""go on a bike ride for exercise"". I rolled off to scorned and confused looks from mom, dad, grandparents, aunts, uncles and most of all my good friends (well they weren't / aren't great in all honestly but i was worse). I rolled away from my own party within an hour, and from about four good friendships and all broken family ties which still haven't been repaired.

When I got clean 1/1 you were amongst the ones supporting me, but you were the only one who kept tabs on me, checking up on me, keeping me going after the initial weeks. Always checking up on me, giving me motivation, steering me in the right direction. My life is now on the rails again with work and school, my own place and no opiate addiction for 9 months.

Our daily talks is my therapy and you always make me come out of a conversation, however bad i felt/was before it, better. 

I wanna thank you for putting up with me, I know my faults and theyre pretty enourmous - traumatised and emotionally fucked. You kept me balanced. You were always a true friend whenever i needed it, and still is. And I love you for it, so much. You're the best friend I've ever had and you're the saving grace of my life.

These are well-known tried and true methods that have worked for myself and countless others I just want to gather all true information on the subject and put it in one place that makes it easily accessible to any/all who may need it. I've found a big key in quick tapers being successful and not leading back to a relapse is surviving (by that I mean not using) the week after you take your last 2mg. As I explain, this is best accomplished by putting yourself in a situation in which you CAN'T use. For example my Mom lives out on an acreage, if I want to make it so I CAN'T use, I simply go out there, give my Mom my bank card, car keys, and phone with the explicit instruction to not give them back until the week is up. This technique works best for those lacking in the willpower dept. (which is many us). Keep in mind that none of this makes any difference without a radical shift in perception/outlook, radical shift in thinking (thoughts, thought processes, thought patterns, etc), radical shift in state of mind, radical shift in mindset, radical shift in emotionally maturity, radical shift in morality, radical shift in self love/respect/esteem/appreciation/etc, radical shift in self belief/self expectation (as in, what you expect from yourself). In general, even if you stop using, ultimately YOU need to change or nothing else will. Love you guys/gals, talk to you soon.

Im somewhat active on this sub on my main acct and have a huge request for the community: I lost someone very close to me in 2009 named Le@h L3ftwich(not trying to trigger future google results for her name). Also went by the spelling Liya. She was 25 in 2009 when she past, very petite(maybe 5'2"" and never over 100lb), dark blue eyed and blonde. She lived in The Boca Raton, Boynton Beach and West Palm Beach areas during this time and Philadelphia for a short time before that(maybe '03-'05).

deeply involved with opioid pills, consumption and moving, but also general drug and party scenes certainly.

In case this or other names in this case trigger anything for someone: she was mentioned once in 2007 in a police report regarding the killing of Ch@d Summerl!n http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2007-11-07/news/0711070030_1_drug-related-arrest-detectives-arrest-report

really hoping someone who knew or met her in either of these areas sees this. She was very close to me but I know little about her adult life and would love to hear anything if anyone has info. Stories, experiences, connections to people who may know more.

best to everyone reading

ZubSolv 5.7mg every 12 hours... I haven't taken a ZubSolv since 10am yesterday, I took 60mg of Oxycodone, 50mg of Vicodin and 30mg of Valium at 3pm today (29 hours without ZubSolv)... I should be feeling like I'm ODing right now from all the Opioids and Benzos I just ingested all at once... this is way beyond my usual dose... I feel no eye rolling, no euphoria, etc.. I'm 19 and diagnosed as hyper-metabolic (fast metabolized). My normal dose that would get me high before the subs was only 50mg of Oxy and 2nf of Xanax.. I thought Buprenorphine was a partial agonist not a tolerance sky-rocketer; a drug people use to wade off withdrawal until they get their usual dose.. what the fuck is going on? Is my theory/fact/opinion right about why I'm not high right now or is it something else?? I just wasted all this money it feels like. Would like an explanation for this and advice on the next time I buy a lot of opiates how do I feel my usual dose when I go off the Zub/Sub without my sweet oxy and all going to complete waste....

TL;DR: off Subs/Zubs for 29 hours, took much higher dose of opiates and Benzos that I need to get High and I still didn't get  high, no nodding,, no eye rolling no extreme high at for an extreme dose considered extreme for my body. What happened or what did I do wrong to not get an actual High after waiting all these 24+ hours with no actual high/nod except for maybe a 2.5/10. THANKS FRIENDS.",1504993654.0

Anyway, Ive been without for a couple of days now and just got offered a 15mg roxy to give someone a ride. Its such a low dose that its barely worth it but i feel like shit right now and im broke so not much to lose. What can I do to get the most out of it? 
I know everyone on this sub is at a different point in this addiction so Ill just give you a quick idea of where im at. 
On a good day I have at least 60-80mg of something throughout the day. I prefer oxy of course but I can get by with hydro just fine. 
Ive stuck with just taking it orally. Ive thought about snorting but I tried it once years ago and fucking hated everything about the way it felt. But i was a kid and not as desperate I guess.
Im not open to any other forms of ingesting really so I guess my question is would it make it any more powerful or satisfying if I snorted it? I know its not going to work wonders either way but still.
Or is there anything I can take along with it?

Then he fucking drives off! And doubles back around and freaks my friend out throwing the drugs in her window. 

But, hey I got free drugs and helped my friend score. I mean an hour isn't so bad I guess. 

We were about to fucking leave and as soon as he seen the car move slightly he'd suddenly text me saying, '3 minutes away' or 'here' when in actuality this fucking dumbass had been circling the parking lot watching us and circling around us a couple times before finally meeting with us. I pointed the fucking car he was in several times to her, like it looks like it but the tags are off by a state. Low and behold I was right to begin with. And he had the nerve to yell at me. 

There is also another aspect to this story I might share in the comments, I typed it but damn y'all would judge me so hard as well as my friend but dammit I just wanted my free drugs. Shit, I'm even judging myself hardcore so we'll see if I share it. 

Ah, its nice sharing hobbies with life long friends. 

And as I was typing this another one of my dealers called offering me more free drugs, then we joked about my birthday and he was like get to me today and I got a present for you. Better not be his damn dick and more drugs dammit. 

Today is a good drug day for me, I can jive with it. Unless this is the calm before the storm, haha get it?
