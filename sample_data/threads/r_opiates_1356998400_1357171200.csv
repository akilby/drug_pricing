And what would you do if you found out a younger sibling and/or their friends were using opiates?","I'm curious because my younger brother and his friends have mentioned taking Vicodin, taking morphine, snorting oxys and talking about how much they like the feeling and the high, a couple of them have mentioned it's even better then weed. I'm just sitting here confused and a bit afraid about what to do, I don't want him making the same mistakes I did. I also do not want to ignore it completely. 

  My brother knows I use but not how much I actually use, I never ever give him any drugs and never use around him or his friends and his friends do not know I use and I plan to keep it that way. I don't condone minors using opiates but I don't want to be the buzz kill/ass hole older sister. 

  I'm thinking about sitting my brother down for a talk about the dangers of using prescription pills/opiates, which will include how easily addictive they are, how much trouble he'll get in if he gets caught, showing him statistics on overdoses, and informing him how to use in the safest manner. If I can't stop him from experimenting I can at least prevent harm right? 

  If the situation escalates I will have no choice but to tell our parents and his friends parents but right now I think it's just a faze where teenagers are starting to experiment with other substances besides cannabis.

  If you have anything to add or any advice on how I should handle this situation it's much much appreciated, if it helps he's 17 and I'm 21. Thank you all very much in advance.

Tl;dr: Found out younger brother and his friends have been using prescription pills/opiates, don't want to be the buzz kill older sibling. Pretty sure and hoping it's just a teenage drug experimentation faze. Simply just thinking about sitting him down for a talk and need advice on how to go about this situation.",1357011090.0

After a while its just life, you can’t live with the drugs.. but you can’t live without them even more. We get high because the world’s uncomfortable, uninteresting and unbearable. Always.

So when your friend notices the track marks you’ve been attempting to conceal with long sleeve shirts and jackets, simply tell them this; we get high to cope or to forget, we get high to think or to stop thinking, we get high to relate to others or maybe we don’t want to relate at all. We get high to fit in, or we get high because we’ve blended in too much. We get high to feel something, and sometimes to feel nothing at all. But most of all we get high because we’re empty, and we’re empty because we’re missing something.. the key to being a functional member of society. We don’t possess what’s required to be, like them. We’re just desperately trying to survive in their world, because it certainly isn’t ours. We’re trying to function, think and behave.. the way the rest of them do.

Except with our irregular pupils, our track marks and slurred speech, we still aren’t very functioning. And yet multiple times a day I’m able to easily convince myself that my blacked out eyes, my shaky hands, my slow beating heart and my slowed state of mind have absolutely no effect on how well I’m able to function in society. All of the things I tell myself are fallacies, but I’m capable of believing them regardless. Junkie justification; it’s our must powerful weapon against our own common sense and comprehension of what it means to be healthy and productive.

Anything can be justified, when you’re a junkie.",1357137393.0

I remember a while ago I withdrew a check from my IRA, and got it expedited to my house. The Fed Ex guy dropped the envelope off at 9:45, I cashed the check at a Wal Mart at 10:00am exactly. The amount was north of $3,500. I basically had it setup so I would call someone once I had the money to buy 35 original OC 80s and 120 box M 30mg oxys. So after driving from Wal Mart to his house, my heart was pounding like a fucking jack hammer in my chest, I couldn't contain my elation and excitement any longer. I pick the stuff up, and when I went to pay for it I felt like the guy in Pulp Fiction sitting in Lance's house with a lap full of 100 dollar bills. I got back to my house at 11:30 with everything in hand and went to town. The next week or so is a total blur but I know I had fun.

Hydrocodone
Strength 1 for 10mg B/A ≥80%

Morphine (oral)
Strength 1 for 10mg B/A ≈25%

Does that mean you'd have to take over 3 times the amount of morphine to equal the strength of hydrocodone?

Or is morphine 3 x as strong but it equals out the same per mg because of B/A?

Also Morphine (IV/IM) [not caring to address that IV would have to be stronger than IM right now.]

strength 3 for 3.33 mg with 100% B/A

Because of the injected morphine being listed as stronger, I'm guessing that the B/A is factored into the strength rating in this chart.  The only other explanation I have is that the chart is wack (it is wikipedia).

Edit: for anyone who hasn't already seen it on the sidebar, [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_comparison) is what I'm referring to

Edit 2: http://mcintranet.musc.edu/agingq3/calculationswesbite/convchart.pdf here's another chart I found with somewhat different info.  I think that the wikipedia one is kinda silly and I think Halsfield's response is pretty good.",1357089641.0
