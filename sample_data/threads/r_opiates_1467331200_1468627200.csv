It was not the answer, however, Now I am buzzing with all kinds of questions.","So for the past 2 hours or so I've been nodding in and out of consciousness trying to get where I am right now, typing into this little box. 

This feels great. I am finally touching something real. Until now I haven't made it past my imagination. I've typed up essays, monologues, dialogues, shower-thoughts.    Wait that's itkoifff 

I'm leaving that there as evidence of where I nodded off. I'm better than I was an hour ago though. It was kind of like groundhog day where my thought process reset every 10 seconds, spending most of that allotted time period figuring out what I was trying to do. 

Needless to say I've just been caught in different types of self-aggregating swirls of futility. 

I don't intend for this to be some kind of pathetic attempt at literature. Please no, this is just how I think when trying to translate Flemish into English wih mos of my o

I don't know what I was trying to say there. 

So OK,  (this would be so much easier if you could just read my mind because you should have seen the epic PowerPoint presentation that just went off)

1. I was underwhelmed with the ""rush"" I was conditioned to expect. This probably just means I need to do more but that means I could accidentally kill myself so for my first shot I wanted to err on the side of life. 

I had been smoking it during the day and was moderately high prior to injecting. Perhaps the rush would be stronger if, let's say, I use injection as my means to introduce the substance into my bloodstream. 

Alright, sorry about my hipster choice of words. I'm just working with what's coming out.. It's hard to desribr

fuck I nodded off again

and again



2!   So I made sure to do my homework prior to injecting. Unfortunately though I still feel bruised. I made sure to register my entry into the vein. The first time was easy. Oh... I just remembered I shot up twice. I did it a second time because the first shot was so weak. 

Well the second shot seemed pretty week as far as the rush went but the overal amount of heroin did get me very high. 

I'm bruised though. I shot up twice in the same vein and registering happened fairly spotlessly so I didn't get the impression that this vein was mangled or beat up in any kind of way. I made sure to release the tourniquet before pushing down the plunger and as I pushed down there was no painful sensation of any kind. 

That being said, I was moderately intoxicated already at the time of injecting so I may have not felt the indication of something being amiss. I just don'thtti  <- nod


now I'm typing like a teenager but I guess the excitement I feel about having succeeded in the self-administration of intravenous heroin is much akin to losing my virginity as a teenager. Yay? 


So I feel bruised around the injection site. Over the past hour it seemed to have softened up or perhaps my fear of touching it has subsided to the point where I was able to feel that maybe it isn't as bad as it could be. 

Ideally I would keep my physical appearance in line with the ruse of my year long sobriety. So a carbuncular arm with 2 conspicuous micro wounds, or whatever hipster shit my brain just spat out, I wouldn't want my girlfriend to be able to tell what's going on is what I'm trying to say. So if you can reassure me or forewarn me of what might be happening, given the information divulged above, that would be much appreciated. 


**TLDR:**  I shot up for the first time. **Why no rush?** I used half of what I lay down to smoke. (well above average quality black tar) Should I use more? Did half of it get stuck in the cotton filter? (used a ripped off qtip) 

I'm bruised even though from what I can surmise based on what I've googled and gandered I did everything right. **What can I do to hide/heal/explain away the bruising?**

All things considered, folks that cant see can get along and adapt pretty well, but some things require sight. I can even imagine being able to shoot blind, but you couldnt see the register. Maybe you could get away with it at first, but once your veins get finicky no way, its hard enough to hit with vision.

My idea for the post is to ask you what is your personal pick for your top five favorite opiates to use. You have to have personal experience with using them and if you want give an explanation why you like each.  List them from highest to lowest to avoid confusion.  Lets see how similar or different our choices are.

1. Heroin - This is the best drug I ever had in my entire life.  Heroin is king of the opiates and has earned it's place, and I would bet it would be on the majority of the top's of everyone's list.  It has such a rush to it when IV'd and the nod is great.  I wish it could be bought over the counter instead of on the street so we could get pure H and not have to worry about contaminants. 

2. Daulidid - I nicknamed this drug hospital heroin.  It sometimes has even a stronger rush then heroin itself in my opinion, but not a stronger high and the high is much short itself as well.  But I am not complaining as I have always loved daulidid.  

3. Opana - In my opinion the strongest opiate pill that is prescribed.  These fuckers will knock you on your ass, even railing them.  I always will buy these babys if they are on the market.

4. Oxycodone -  Oxy is a nice opiate that has a speedy effect.  It is nice for when I need to do things through the day but not be nodding off too bad.  However if I do want too nod if, I can take enough and I can still get there with oxy.  I have no complaints. 

5.  Morphine - The classic.  Nothing wrong with a pure shot of morphine in the arm.

I'll know in a few days if it worked.,"So I've been taking subs for 1.5 years now. I've been on them for years previously before quitting and getting back on, but I had been at 4-5mgs the last couple months until the 15th, 15 days ago. 

The plan was to switch to an opioid with a shorter half life for the 2-3 weeks, and then withdrawal off those with methadone. I couldn't be dragging ass at work for 3 weeks. I know sub withdrawal is supposed to be milder than dope, but I'd rather have it over with quicker even if it is more brutal. 

So since taking my last sub dose on the 15th, I have been taking hydros like a motherfucker up until yesterday. (Might have done some speedballs for a good week as a last glass) Yesterday I took my first dose of methadone. Planning on taking my last dose of methadone on Sunday, which would be in three days (five day methadone taper) after which I guess I'll see what the fuck happens. I'll have Monday and Tuesday off of work, and those will be my two days buffer to be on absolutely nothing.

Anyone with similar experiences that wants to put in their two cents would be appreciated. I know I should have planned it better, but this is how I do things. I just decide 'fuck it'. Looking into getting clonodine locally since its too late to order online. Otherwise I got like a couple dozen .5mg benzos and muscle relaxers, which I'm not too crazy about. Otherwise, by the time I'm done with the methadone will be 3 weeks exactly off of suboxone and 5 days since taking hydros/dope. ",1467305003.0

I ask because I heard some disturbing news,  As Im sure most of you know the OCs still exist in Canada and several other countries.  So, I heard that shortly in Canada all of our oxycodone (excluding mixed formulations, eg percs) is going to be changed to some sort of gel.  Think along the lines of advil liquid relief. So if we lose our OCs here, we don't have the roxi 15mg/30mg pills that you guys do in the states.  we do have IR formulations, but they're massive pills bigger than the OC80s with a ton of chalky ass filler.

At around 11 PM I chewed up 25mg of oxy. I had tried oxy and hydro before, probably around 4 or 5 times in various doses but I was always underwhelmed, probably because I was expecting a true ""high"" akin to other drugs. Around 20 minutes in, I started getting the relaxed feeling and pure contentment and I instantly knew that that was the opiate high that everyone was talking about. My body felt really warm and I was extremely relaxed. It was then that I chewed up another 5mg oxy. For the next hour or so, I felt extremely physically relaxed and mentally ""numbed"" (not euphoric, just not really thinking at all) as I browsed the internet and talked to some friends. It was quite fun, except whenever I stood up I felt really dizzy like I was drunk. I decided to vape a little bit and get a nicotine headrush, except I kind of overdid it and I got a bit nauseous. I decided to just call it a night and go to sleep, thinking that I was sober now and I was happy with the high that I had. Man, was I wrong. I put a blanket over me and it felt like it cocooned my entire body with some warm forcefield, even if it was only on a portion of my body. I kept on going in and out of lying in my bed with a warm layer surrounding me, and drifting into these extremely vivid dreams that it seemed like I could kind of control. It was about 1 AM when I tried to go to sleep, and at 1:20 I had just been thrust awake from a vivid dream in which my friend drove his car into the ocean with me inside of it and I genuinely thought I was going to die. I remember that I wanted to go on the IRC chat on my phone, but for some reason I was paranoid that the police were keylogging my phone and I tried to google ""can police track your phone"" but I fell asleep again before I could finish my google search. I drifted in and out of these dreams until like 4AM, but I can't tell you for sure cause it's kind of hazy. I woke up and my bed and chair were completely drenched in sweat haha. Overall, it was a really different and kind of neat experience, and now I know for sure what opiates have to offer. I got these pills for free from a friend who didn't want to use them, and I don't really see myself spending $30 for one high, so I don't really think I'm going to be doing oxy often. However, if I have the opportunity to get some more for free/cheap I'll gladly accept.

TL;DR: Tried a higher oxy dose, finally understand the opiate high. Drifted in and out of vivid dreams and excreted a bathtub's worth of sweat.",1467432037.0

I met this guy in late may when I bought for the first time. I didn't have any connects at all at the time so I desperately call an old friend who I haven't spoken to in years but know that she's had substance abuse problems in the past. She hits me up with her middle man who comes to meet us along with two other guys. Middle-man is in back and the two other guys are in the front seat, as soon as the guy in the front passenger seat sees me  he start to freak out about what I'm buying, how many I bought, etc and basically yelled ""I don't want her to die!"". The guy driving was the one in charge and he tried to hush him. After I got what I came for and we said bye this guy shouted - from the window - ""You know you have right to get treatment, don't you? Get treatment!"".


I didn't think much of it at the time, wrote it off as a funny anecdote I could tell people about the first time I bought.

So, next time I don't have my friend with me as a security blanket and I had to meet this guys alone. Turns out when I get to the place we are supposed to meet my middle and driver/boss-guy haven't showed up yet and only this really cute guy who freaked out before is there to meet me. We talked, smoked some oxy and he went on and on about how he wanted me to quit, that I had to quit and told me about this program he's on and even offered to with me if I wanted.

Fast forward a bit, my middle and I talked on Facebook. He seems really into me, I'm not into him but play along. He told me that this guy wanted my number and asked me if it was OK. He also warned me about him, told me he didn't really like him. My heart starts to beat, both because I'm really new into this scene (not substance abuse though, unfortunately) and because I thought he was so incredibly cute. So the first thing this guy does when he gets my number is asking me if I have any oxy, which left a sour taste in my mouth. Then he proceeds to ask me about Xanax (I was so fucking stupid for telling him about my script!), said he felt like shit (who the fuck doesn't?!). Anyway, he then goes out and gives out my number to a dealer and says I should answer him when he calls because he could sell me 5 oxy. Stupidly I answered and agreed to meet up this dealer - whom I never met before. I'm a tiny petite girl, I took a huge risk. 

The same evening this guy texts me that he had been up for days, had taken coke and lots of other shit and that he felt as if he was going to die. Asks me if I have any oxy left... I felt disgusted, told him I didn't have any (why the fuck should I have to share my hard-earned money with a fucking junkie!). Felt bad about it a bit later... Texted him back if Xanax was OK. He replied ""10?!?!?!"" and I told him I only had 4 left which he reluctantly accepted. He promised me that later that night he could get me a much better price, all he had to do was to borrow some money first (which he also asked me for, I almost forgot to write that...). He'd be back in 4 hours tops. I went back to my place after leaving him the 4 Xanax and I remember feeling like complete and utter shit, which I really shouldn't since I'd taken oxy and everything is always alright in the world when I do (it feels like that to me, at least). The guy I just met was not the same as that sweet guy I met before, what the fuck happened to that guy who actually gave a shit? Even his eyes weren't the same, before he had these really kind eyes and now his eyes were completely empty. Like he wasn't even in there, it was eerie. Well, this made take way to many Xanax and even the last of my oxy. So by that point I'd taken 400 mg oxy plus 8 or 10 mg Xanax (I don't really recall) and finally I nodded off. 


Woke up to a bunch of missed calls from this guy, texted him back that I nodded off and how I was sorry I missed it. Explained that I had taken way too many pills and combined them with benzos so I wasn't all there, so to speak. He gives out my number to another guy yet again as I see an unknown number calling me, and he says I should meet this guy because he has pills to sell. I replied I won't go out in the middle of the night to meet some stranger to score, that I was basically drunk and could hardly walk on my own. He kept pressuring me, told me that this guy drove all the way from another town just to help me. This guy kept calling me and I felt pressured so stupidly enough I went out in the middle of the freakin' night to meet him and he drove me to some other place. He was the sleeziest fucking dealer I've ever met, he noticed how fucked up I was and had to hold me while we walked so that I didn't fall, yet he kept talking shit about his friend (""cute guy""), told me to only contact him in the future and forget about ""cute guy"", because he was ""the real deal"" and ""cute guy"" was just a junkie and a nobody. Told me he could get me horse and that the more I buy from him the better prices I'd get. Said he'd give 0,5 g horse the next day if I gave him 10 xanax. Since I was basically drunk I of course agreed! I'd agree to pretty much anything in that state. He asked me if I could walk back or if I needed a lift (what the fuck do you think, asshole!?) and in the car back he kept asking me all these personal questions, about my name, age, what my boyfriend's name is and for his brother's name. I answered them truthfully, which I regret now when I'm sober. He said I looked so young and even turned the lights on in the car because he wanted to get a better look at my face... That felt shitty.

After this incident I became motivated as hell to quit. Never before have anyone made me felt so shitty about myself, never before have I felt like a real junkie, I felt cheap, I felt like a slut. And all because of ""Cute guy"", how the fuck could I let him feel this way about myself? Dealer from the night before called and texted me a bazillion times, I replied to some texts with how busy I am etc, but after almost a week of texting and calling I finally answered and told him I had decided to quit on my own and wasn't interested in any of this anymore, I wanted to put it past me. Then I went ahead and changed my number.

""Cute guy"" writes to me on Facebook shortly after this and it bothers me that he went through the trouble to look me up on FB. He asks if I have anything, because he feels like shit (maybe because you are). I tell him no. Then I get enough of all these begging messages, I write him a long message telling him how disappointed I was in him and how he wasn't the same sweet guy I met before. He replied that he was sorry if he hurt me, he didn't mean to he only tried to help me (yeah, right) but he was truly sorry and that he have been having a tough time because of a friend who passed a way a couple years ago. Uh-huh. I rolled my eyes but I accepted his apology. During this time he writes me only when he wants something. Around a week ago my cat died, which made me incredibly sad since he is like a son to me. I told him that and he wrote back that he hopes he rest in peace, then later that night he asks me: ""ratspark, please ratspark, I'VE DONE COCAINE! I haven't slept for 6 days, my heart hurts! Do you have Xanax?!?!?!"". I couldn't fucking believe it. At this point I should be done with him once and for all, right? I'm insane otherwise. WRONG! 

So, I went a week in full-blown withdrawal, right at the same time my cat got sick and passed away. It was incredibly hard, especially after my cat died. A day after I got some kind of brain fart and wrote that I wanted to kill myself to ""Cute guy"". He asked me where I lived and told me he would come over but I didn't answer him. Next day I had enough so I called him. I told him I needed help and he said sure. We meet up and he tells me this wild story (which I know is bullshit, I'm not stupid) about how if he gets a certain amount from me he could borrow another certain amount and he could buy 100 for a much, much cheaper price. It was simply too good to be true, and I knew he was lying. I told him this too, that I didn't trust him and he kept reassuring me that I could trust him, that I was like a little sister to him. We went in to a store in the ""ghetto"" part of town to buy aluminium foil for him, turns out he didn't have any money whatsoever so I had to pay for it. It was emberassing, I felt like this junkie guy's mother! 


We talked for almost two hours, he wasn't really there and he was fucked up on a lot of stuff, very twitchy and with an empty look in his eyes. He asked me why I changed my number and I told him it was because he gave it to half the town, which he said wasn't true and how he only gave it to one guy and I corrected him. I told him about everything, my experience with the last dealer he forced me to meet and how I never felt that cheap in my whole life before. I don't know if he really got it, as all he seemed to think about was drugs in general and hoping to become some kind of drug lord in particular. Tells me he was in juvie for 6 years and just got out in may. He showed me his phone and asked me if I liked it and wanted one, because he was going to beat my middle up and take his phone. I tried to calm him down and reason with him, but that was simply impossible so I gave up on that pretty quickly. After a lot of talking I (stupidly) agreed to take 28 oxy 40's and hold them for him until he gets back in exchange for a lot of money (I could buy almost double that for the same amount of money). He promised me he'd be back in 3 hours tops with the pills and told me I shouldn't worry and how it'd be a really dick-move to con a girl. I knew he was bullshitting, as I wrote earlier, I was just desperate and I didn't have anywhere else to turn (my middle isn't active anymore since his friend got arrested).


A couple drives by and he told me to wait where I was while he talked to them. I waited and then he signed for me to come and told me those were his friends and that they'd give me a ride home. He hugged me and his whole body was cold, stiff and he was incredibly skinny, almost as skinny as me and I'm under-weight. I practically begged him not to fool me during our hug, hoping that it somehow would reach his conscience so that he'd at least feel a little bit bad.


I get into the car and the woman is driving, the couple seemed super normal and we shit-chatted on the way. The woman asks me if I was ""Cute guy's"" girlfriend and I told her I wasn't, but that I think he's really cute. She said we should be together then and I just responded with a nervous giggle (please, shoot me). She tells me that he has a good heart, but one problem that starts with O and ends with Y and I - in poor judgement - tells her that I have the same problem. Anyway, both she and her boyfriend seemed cool and when I got out of the car she told me I should stop using because I was such a pretty girl. That made me feel a bit better, actually. At that point I sincerely regretted making that stupid decision that I did earlier. I get home, get well and don't hear anything from ""Cute guy"", he didn't respond to my texts. Just like expected. Next day I wrote him on FB and asks him why he won't answer me. I wrote several messages during the day. 


Late in the evening he calls me and tells me this wild crazy story about his phone that stopped working and how he got ripped off and how he had to give this other guy a lot of money because he'd borrowed money from him before. Re-assures me it's the truth and says how horrible it is for him because he is stuck in another town without a car or any other way to get back home and in withdrawal. Yeah, right, I thought while he blabbered on. He then had the nerve to ask me how many I had left! I told him I already took them all (I obviously hadn't, but I wasn't going to tell him there were any left because I know he'd guilt-trip me into giving them back to him) and he seemed super surprised. I could tell he was at a friend's place or had a friend with him because he was talking to someone and they were discussing numbers. Unfortunately I couldn't really say everything I wanted to say to him because my bf was home, so I had to keep it as short as I could. ""Cute boy"" promised me to fix it and that he'd either get the pills in another way, get my money back or I'd get his Oxys the next time he gets his script. Tells me I shouldn't worry (I've heard that before...) and that he'd keep his other phone on the whole night so that I could text him if I wanted. Around two hours after we hung up I texted him that I didn't want to hear anything from him until he ""fixes"" it and reminded him not to give my number to anyone. I also told him I would not be meeting any of his friends on parking lots or anywhere else, just to be clear. He texts me back with, you guessed it, ""Don't worry!"".


I didn't hear anything from him until yesterday, when I woke up to a text which said: ""Hey, what's up?"". I texted him back and told him I was in a hurry because I had an appointment (which I had). He called me later in the afternoon, but because I was with my parents I couldn't answer. Today I haven't heard anything from him. I keep looking at the phone like a fucking teenage girl. What's wrong with me? Did I suffer major permanent brain damage after the bad fall I had around three months ago? I'm torn between all these feelings. I don't know what to do.

I realize this got incredibly long, I'm so sorry, but there's just too much shit in my head. I needed to get some out, somehow... Here's a **TL; DR:** I think I'm falling in love with a piece of shit junkie who just begs me for stuff all the time, am I brain-damaged?",1467420437.0

Is he full of shit?,"My boyfriend and I have been together one year and we both used together (him a lot more than me though). I kicked fent and went through some bad WD's but I've only had real mild side effects when kicking dope, within 2 days I usually feel fine. 

He had a problem with both xanax and dope so now that he's trying to quit he's essentially quitting both. He checked himself into detox for safety reasons and just came home two days ago, which makes him about 14 days sober now. He's still suffering from RLS, has had some nausea, and still seems a little uncomfortable, but he can get out of bed during the day just fine. 


The thing is since he's gotten back he's been acting very strange towards me. A lot more combative, refusal to discuss any issues, and his sex drive is totally gone. He went as far as calling me a crazy bitch the other day because I asked him what was going on and he wanted me to drop it. I know, I know, he sounds horrible. But for the year that we've been together I've never seen him quite like this, it's like he came home a different person. On the other hand this is the longest he's stayed clean since we started dating, and in his moments of clarity he says that he's still in a lot of pain and just feels really depressed/moody lately. 


Since I don't personally have WD's anywhere near to that extent I did my research and read all about PAWS and how people coming off both heroin and Xanax can go through personality changes, mood swings, etc. If that's the case then I'm willing to ride it out, but I'm worried that there's something more to this. I figure if anyone could relate to what he's going through they'd be here- so I'm just looking for a little insight. 


Is this strange/aggressive behavior something that can happen to people? Or is he just using this as an excuse? Also, talking to him about it or trying to get him to open up to me is not possible, he just gets defensive and we end up fighting.

4r1saa,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4r1saa/withdrawal_grammar_guide_serious_shitpost/,93,https://redd.it/4r1saa,jesusfuckingfuck,"""Withdrawal"" grammar guide (serious shitpost)","Alright, I'm about to make myself the subject of a lot of hate through being a grammar nazi. No one likes a grammar nazi. But, having spent 4 terms at uni studying to become an English teacher (didn't finish because of heroin addiction), one of my biggest pet peeves is incorrect grammar. What I'm going to talk about is something I've seen a lot around here and it's been bugging the fuck out of me.

*Disclaimer: English is my second language so please, feel free to point out any grammar or spelling mistakes I've made. The irony will not be lost on me. Also, I want to make it clear that I in no way judge or think any less of anyone who makes or has made these mistakes. We all have blindspots*

Ok, so, this post concerns the word 'withdrawal' and the morphology of it. I see it being used incorrectly all the time around here and I've finally reached a point of self-loathing where I don't care how much hate I'll get for pointing it out; I just have to say something about it because it makes my brain itch every time I see it.

Merriam-Webster has a number of definitions for the word withdrawal, but the one that is relevant to us is the following:

""c (1) :  the discontinuance of administration or use of a drug (2) :  the syndrome of often painful physical and psychological symptoms that follows discontinuance of an addicting drug <a heroin addict going through withdrawal>""

Now, there are a number of ways in which we can change the morphology of the word 'withdrawal'. To begin with, here are some examples of mistakes I've seen here in r/opiates:

* ""I was withdrawaling for a week""
* ""What substance did you withdrawal from?""
* ""I withdrawaled for longer than I had expected""
* ""My withdraws were pretty mild""
* (I have also seen ""withdrawls"" quite a lot which is simply incorrect spelling)

So how do we turn those sentences into grammatically correct ones? Like so:

* ""I was *withdrawing* for a week""
* ""What substance did you *withdraw* from?""
* ""I *withdrew* for longer than I had expected""
* ""My *withdrawals* were pretty mild""

As you probably know, there are loads upon loads of irregularities when it comes to morphology in the English language. However, with this word, there is a clear pattern:

* You withdraw from heroin.
* You go through withdrawal.
* You *have gone* through withdrawals.
* You are *in a state of* withdrawal.
* Last week, you withdrew from heroin.
* Next week, you *will* withdraw from heroin.
* Right now, you *are* withdrawing from heroin.

I think that's about it. I've read the word withdrawals so many times now that it has completely lost its meaning and is just a random collection of letters so I have probably made mistakes here and there. But anyway, there you go, hopefully I won't see these mistakes being made as much around here (or I'll see a surge of mistakes being made on purpose just to fuck with people like myself).

If you read this far, thank you and well done. If anyone is interested in morphology in general, this is a pretty good summary: http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/ling001/morphology.html

Now bring the hate!",1467547902.0

What I wanted were 29g syringes, all my ""spares"" were used up. I went to Walgreens and all I could say was ""Could I have a ten pa—?"" He then immediately walked over to the counter just to the left of where he  reaches down and says, ""Here you go"". He then hands me a ten pack of 29g insulin syringes and I pay quickly go away.

I'm having trouble registering.,"I gently nudged against the spoon when filling my syringe. Did that make it blunt? It seemed discouragingly hard to puncture just the skin. Should I discard and grab another rig is I accidentally push the tip against a hard surface?

Also, I still haven't found an optimal way of holding the rig between my fingers, especially when pulling back to check if I'm in the vein. 

I practiced a bit before injecting and sometimes I could barely get the plunger to go back just like that. I would pull on it and suddenly it would move in a jerk-like motion. 

So that is making it difficult for me when I'm looking for the vein, when it's hard to pull blood into it I'm not even sure if I missed or not because I seem to be having just as much difficulty pulling air into it.

That makes me wonder how many times I actually was in a vein but I just couldn't pull back the plunger for other reasons.

And I'm not sure what those could be.. maybe I'm holding it at a weird angle causing it to get stuck or something.

There are others with me, but they are walking along the banks telling me , ""Just get out of the water,"" but instead of extending a hand in help, they just move on and leave me behind.

Every once in a while I find a rock that is strong enough for me to lean on and I can rest for a bit, but the rocks always get tired of holding me up, and when they let go, I'm left drowning, thrown back 50 feet again.

And nothing is harder than standing up in that current, when everything in you is telling you how much easier things would be if you just let yourself get dragged under.

Lately I have been finding that getting high isn't really getting me high anymore, it's just making me feel numbly depressed. I began using opiates because it was the greatest anti depressant and worked for making me more extroverted. Long story short I became your typical junkie and it made my problems that much worse. I lost my friends, never had much of a family but I guess whatever bond I thought I had with them disappeared to. I lost my sanity, freedom, dignity, positive sense of ego, etc. All of this of course made my depression worse. I found that using opiates made that feeling go away and made me comfortably numb. 3 years ago I began having suicidal thoughts everyday that have not let up to this day. Everyday I think about just letting it all go and slipping off into a sweet sweet opioid OD just to sleep forever and be done with the world that never wanted me in it and nor did I want to be of it. I continued to live because as much as I like to say I don't fear death, I do I can't seem to override that extremely strong internal instinct that fears the abyss the unknown and possibly the great nothing after this. As painful as it is sometimes it still feels good to breathe because at least you feel something. Anyhow lately though I haven't been afraid of the nothing and breathing has lost it's novelty and so I figured the way to remedy this is to start chipping again. I just bought 7 dilly's on thursday and i'm already down to 2 which isn't good as always I told myself I would ration them and not do them during work etc. I have broken every law that I set for myself showing that I am already out of control it's like I just accelerated where I left off at last like i'm determined to back myself into an unescapable corner where the only option left is an OD. The drugs aren't working anymore and they were my only reason to stay. I have abandoned all hope it seems and i'm just slipping further into the abyss and I can see the event horizon the point of absolutely no return and it's gravitational pull on me is just to strong to resist I am now just drifting toward it and it feels good to finally stop fighting to finally accept my upcoming fate that will end by my own hand.

This was my first experience with fent (that I know of at least, or that was just fent and not mixed with dope). From what I've read, fent is supposed to be a pure white powder, and draw up clear. Well the shit I had was pure white, but in the cooker/rig it had a brownish tint to it. It was also really weak at small amounts (I did tons of test shots since I didn't wanna OD and knew all the bad shit about fent). Eventually when I got a good gauge of its potency I did bigger shots which gave me a rush but that was it. I did about like 20+ shots and killed the 1+ gram bag in about an hour or so, but for some reason, only some of the shots gave me a rush, regardless of their size (when I do dope, every shot gives me a rush, provided it's a big enough shot that'd give me a rush in general). 

I also got to realize that fent has essentially no euphoria, just a nod... and the nod wasn't the type of 'dreamy' nod that I've come to expect from dope.

So anyway I was wondering, has anyone had any fent that was pure white powder but drew up with a brownish/yellowish tint instead of clear in the rig? and those who've done fent, was the nod a 'dreamy' nod (where when you shut your eyes you're dreaming but as soon as you open them, the dream ends, and a new one'll start when your eyes close again)? My boy didn't know what type of fent it was so I'm curious if any of you guys have any ideas as to what type it might be. I'm obviously assuming it's a RC/analog but there's a bunch of fent ones so I can see if it'd be hard to figure out. Thanks guys, you're the best!

EDIT: fixed some typos/grammatical errors. 

And I'd like to add one more thing. Does anyone have experience with fent analogs that do have euphoria? And also, I've always wondered if like smoking weed and doing fent would be good together, since the weed would provide the euphoria and hopefully add to the the trippiness of the nod, while the fent itself would just provide the rush and the nod.

You see, I have this best friend, she's a wonderful girl. I also have this addiction problem, she's a bitch to deal with. I once had a heavy opiate addiction, which I really fought to get over. This was soon followed by a very nasty and corrosive cocaine addiction. It took everything I had to do it, but I got over that, too. My best friend and I met in junior high, and even then was she as tolerant of my habits as she is now, almost a decade later. A near perfect chemistry has kept us tightly bound together for years, basically the missing piece to one another. Well, I recently have been visiting with my old friend, Heroin. My best friend doesn't like the impact Heroin has on me, and neither do I, but my god does Heroin know how to show me a good time and keep me coming back. 

Not very long ago, my best friend and I were hanging out at my place. We were laying on the couch together, having a good time, showing frequent physical affection to each other, and wrestling/brawling. We've done this for years. Well, during one of our wrestling matches, I ended up on top of her, but amidst the chaos of our rough and tough ways, my sleeve rolled up. I'm looking down at her face when I see her eyes catch the crook of my elbow, and remain fixed on it. Her face drops. I was going to tell her I got back into heroin, we don't keep things like that from each other, but I hadn't told her at that point. Upon seeing her face drop I fall into her shoulder. She puts her arms around me, and I hear her breathing harder until the very distinct sound of soft crying takes over. She holds me tighter, and I wrap my arms around her. We hug, cry, and talk. Her and I don't usually cry. Like ever. After a bit, I'm laying down, and she's sat up, basically on my lap, holding my right arm and looking at my track marks. I felt very uncomfortable and vulnerable about this, I don't want her to see that, it causes her pain, but she insists. She stares down at my track marks and closes her eyes. She then gracefully leans down and gently kisses my track marks. She does the same to my left arm. The emotion in this moment I'm not even going to begin to try describing with words. But when I leaned up, and we broke from that moment to look each other in the eyes and be suprised to see so much vulnerability be portrayed on both ends, we had never known each other better. 


No one has ever kissed the marks in the crook of my arms that illustrate the totality of my fault and my habits. 

And when we broke from that moment, I've never kissed anyone so passionately. 

And no one has ever kissed me so passionately back. 


However, there are dreams that need to be seized. We have just over 1 month before she goes off to a great and pretty distant university to pursue the progress of life that's calling her. You guys, I'm going to shoot up again. I'm not at the point of physical addiction yet, like I was last time I was into opiates, but I'm definitely in the cross hairs of yet another very promising addiction battle. But God damn it I'm not going to get into this fight until I send that torpedo of a girl off to excel down the path of glory where her dream is waiting to be sculpted into her reality. I'm beyond proud of her. 

The tragedy and destruction that addiction brings to it's victims and those around it has been in the clear sight of humanity across the world for decades, and will continue to be in view for many more. It truly feels like a war sometimes. This is a war that many of us are fighting on the front lines. Many of us know people who have lost. Many of us are and know people who have won. I've come too far to give up. I'm going to fight this bitch until of us comes out on top. I came into this world kicking and screaming, and I'm going leave this world kicking and screaming. Many addicts think they're weak, but with what we've had to fight through and survived, it shows nothing but strength. 

I love you guys to death, but fuck do you make me want to use sometimes. That's okay though. We all know the fight we're in. We all know what we're up against. We all know we're here for each other. I'm fighting back tooth and nail, and I know you guys are too. I know that we understand each other. There's a lot of humanity shown on this sub and others like it. And I honestly hope that myself, along with the rest of you, will one day come out of this war and be able to get on the path of glory, and turn our dreams into reality without the influence of the permanent weight we've put on our own shoulders. I hope we can do what my best friend is about to do. 

Rock on, you bunch of fellow fuck ups.",1467610304.0

Not that I'd been taking mental notes or anything...my first stop was a shady little convenience store. I go in, check it out. Maybe see of conversation goes naturally, etc. Nah nothing really. As I'm paying for my candy bar, i run into this dude i know from NA meetings up here last fall when i was up here for lile, 45 days ""getting clean"" anyways, he didn't recognize me. I think a little, but not enough to engage. Got outta there. I may actually go to that meeting Monday too...

So down the street I go. I see a white 20 something doing the "" I'll be there in ten"" pace in the front yard....oh he's texting! Oh...he goes inside. Keep  goin

On the other side of the street there are some middle school kids setting off fireworks. They ask me if i have a lighter. I walk over there, and Let The little girl light a firework. Then she lights another, and another and another. Then they start throwing them AT each other. So now I'm getting uncomfortable, and start asking for it back. The little girl would kinda ignore me and light one or two more. Even the other kids were telling her too. She was just being rude, and knew once i walked away, her fun was done. Across the street this whole time is an older lady and her nephew who spoke up. Then THEY called me over to them. 

I knew immediately i was close to something. Chit chat w the Aunt, she has to go sit down after a few. Chit chat w the nephew, ask him what's up. Said he'd have to check around for boy, how did i feel about hard? Well, I'd never smoked it, only ived. And only a hand full of times. Fuck. Whatever. So he takes me back to his aunt!!! Hahahha. Anyways, we toke down on the pipe. He can't find any boy, everyone was away to watch the fireworks. But did i want to throw down on some more hard? Ah fuck it right? As I'm telling them i prefer iv, blah blah blah, she tells me she has boxes!! She has diabetes!! Oh happy day!

I know that Dilaudid is stronger than morphine, and I don't want to fuck around with this stuff until I know exactly what I'm doing. Googling gave me a bunch of conflicting answers, so here's what I need to know:

* I ususally start with 10mg of oxycodone, and then go from there. What is the conversion rate in milligrams from oxy to Dilaudid?

* My preferred route of ingestion is insufflation (snorting). Is that possible with Dilaudid, and if so, is it more dangerous?

* The last time I did opiates was a few months ago, so I'm basically opiate naive. I do take kratom regularly, but I've heard that doesn't affect much in terms of tolerance to heavy opiates like painkillers. No question here, just take that into account if you're gonna offer me advice.

I've always been curious about recreational substances. I've tried alcohol, weed, synthetic weed, 2C-B, 2C-E, 25i, and LSD. I have absolutely zero experience and tolerance to opiates. The closest I've come to true euphoria was after some strong edibles and during the peak of 4 tabs of LSD. Having lurked this subreddit for over 2 years now I've seen just how stealthily this class of substances can take a person's life and bend it to its will. But yet I still for the sake of trying everything once in this beautiful world of ours can't get this nagging feeling of wanting to experience it firsthand. 


**Situation:** My girlfriend and I have been made stewards of a large home owned by an older couple for the next 3 months while they travel the country in their mobile home. The husband recently had major surgery and was prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg, Tramadol 100 mg, and 5mg Oxycodone IR, no APAP. He's heavily made use of the Gabapentin and Tramadol so trying that is out of the question. But for the most part left the 60 count bottle of Oxy alone, saying it makes him feel nauseous and tired. I know once they return from their trip, he should be healed up at that point and will probably toss the Oxy. I doubt he would notice a few missing.


**The Question:** Should I take a few Oxy for the sake of trying it out or leave it alone? I have strong motivation not to eat the whole bottle due to us (my gf and I) being close to this couple and not wanting to lose their trust. How much should I take and what is the best ROA for making the most of my first time?

Like when we were all younger and first discovered drugs; it didn't matter that we had spent all of our money on drugs and skipped class because.. well, fuck it right? Our friends were all experimenting with who they really were and what drugs they liked too, so it just felt natural and there wasn't any of the guilt attached to doing absolutely nothing but get high all day. 

When our circle of friends grew up and matured and eventually stopped experimenting with drugs, we carried on using alone because we liked that feeling it gave us. Spending most of your time alone can make you feel pretty low, and so obviously we discovered that there are better drugs for making you feel like you're having a good time when in reality you're browsing the internet on your own.

Your old friends have never tried the new drugs that are making you feel happy, and a lot of them don't approve of it, so you make new friends that are involved with the new drugs you've been taken. It doesn't take long before you realise that these new 'friends' are nothing like the friends you used to have, and that you can't trust any of them, confide in them, and you don't really want to spend any more time with them than is absolutely necessary. You see some pretty heavy shit that you thought would 'never happen to you', and it sends you spiralling even lower.

Now all you have left is your drug, your lifeline, and it's the only thing that can give you a release from the pain of everyday life. You used to go chill with your friends when you felt shitty, but because you've had to hide the fact that you're using hard drugs your relationships with your family and friends has gradually wilted away. Your parents and your close family have noticed how shady you've been acting recently and have been increasingly distancing themselves you. You're on your own and you're in trouble. You're fucked, man, you're properly addicted to heroin. Well and truly.

Slowly but surely those pain-free nights become less and less frequent. Those nights where everything would feel fine and that it would all be okay start to occur less and less. Now I just feel worse until I've had a hit, and then I just feel like I'm sober.. Normal. I no longer have my chemical blanket to shield me from all the painful realities in life. In the past this would be the point where I would find a stronger drug, or start taking more or taking it with a more efficient ROA, but there is literally nowhere else to go from here. Except from taking more and more heroin, and then blah blah blah you fuck up every aspect of your life, blah blah blah you're left with nothing... 

Except every now and again you reach that point where you are truly wasted and completely numb to all the major problems in your life. I've been intently focusing on quitting and putting a lot of effort into going through the day without needing to buy drugs g, and so have thus been really beating myself up when I crumble and order some shit, but today I've had about half a gallon of rum, an eighth of really good weed, maybe half a gram of crack, a g of heroin, and 100ml of methadone (double my daily dose). So I really don't care right now, I'm completely numb to it all.

So I'm just going to enjoy it. Why not. If I don't end up conquering my addiction and I become part of a statistic, then these sparse pain-free moments are going to be the happiest moments of my entire life. So I'm just gonna sit back and enjoy this rare moment where I'm not in pain.

Does your dr care? Etc,"I have my first PM appt in about 3 1/2 weeks after waiting for over a decade... I was scripted 90 Percocet to make it until then, so I know to have the proper amount in my system for the initial drug screen. The state I live in does not have medical but we DO have oil which was just recently approved for pain; although, as far as I know, they do not offer oil for pain management at my new clinic.

I'm giving myself 3 1/2 weeks to quit which I think should be enough time as I quit for three months between November and Mid-February and have lost about 40 lbs (had a baby) since. I know to try to exercise, flush with water and eat a good diet for the first three weeks, and then I'm planning on packing on the fat for the last few days to get ""new fat"" in me.

I also thought it MIGHT help to dilute my piss beforehand and use vitamins for creatine and color. Should I also take a larger dose than prescribed a day before hand as well, so my test doesn't look like I haven't taken the dose I should, as it will be diluted?

I'm really anxious and nervous for this new chapter but it is definitely bittersweet. The MJ helps so much with my depression (I take an SNRI as it is) and it does help with pain, but I've weighed the pros and cons and come to the decision that I can live without it for the sake of having a steady script... Until, of course, I get cut off (which I hope I won't, I have some nasty and rare diseases) or my clinic shuts down. Hopefully that won't happen; they seem pretty legit though not as strict as places like MAPS and iSpine.

After a few hours I got a headache and felt a bit nauseous but still felt great. Sunday night I used again, this time 60mg IV and had a great night again, though the headache and nausea were a bit stronger. 

Then last night at 9:00pm I used 40mg IV and felt great, less headache and nausea. I had some trouble sleeping and drifted in and out of sleep. At 2:00 am, I was pretty solidly awake and knew I wasn't really going to get anymore sleep before I had to get up at 4:00 am for work so I decided to dose 55mg IV at 2:15 am. The rush took a little longer than usual to come on and was dulled a bit but still nice. I went and laid in bed and nodded for a bit but was getting pretty nauseous so I got up and went to the bathroom. While kneeling in front of the toilet, I felt something in/on my right ear and reached up to touch it and my fingers came away with quite a bit of blood. I put a q-tip in my ear and it came out soaked in blood, same when I flipped it and used the other side. Used a second q-tip and it still had some blood but not very much. I was still feeling nauseous so I went and, after getting my clothes ready for work, laid back down. After a while I felt like I was going to vomit so I went into the bathroom, threw up and grabbed another q-tip, checking my right ear again which was full of blood so I once again used got it all out with a q-tip. After that I drank some cold water (maybe 4 oz) and threw up pretty violently again. After throwing up, I laid down on my bathroom floor and nodded out/slept for maybe 15-20 minutes before turning on my shower to get ready for work. I checked my ear and it was full of blood again, for the third time. 

It's been dry since then (that last time was at about 4:20 am and it is now 8:15 am) but I also haven't laid down since then, could that be why? I can't imagine what would cause the inside of my ear to bleed as I've gently probed the inside of my ear with my finger tip and there aren't any scratches or wounds in there which has me concerned (and completely baffled).

Its the only opiate ive ever used and the only route of administration ive ever taken it in. At first - one bottle would last a week and i was naive enough to think i had it under control like every other drug ive ever fucked with over the years... 
I was wrong. About a month ago it came to the point where if I didnt have 1 bottle each day the withdrawals started withing hours of my last dose. Its completely destroyed my finances - at witch point (roughly a month ago) i decided enough is enough. This has to stop. I took the two weeks off work of holidays i had owed and instead of buying fentanyl i stocked up on Lope, weed, and vallium. The first 6 days were hell but i came out the otherside - but with one serious problem. 
Insomnia. 
Its now been one month since ive touched any kind of opiate & despite the fact that im no longer writhing pain that i cant even begin to describe (though im sure most of you know what im talking about) - puking and shitting constantly - and the RLS has dissipated... That was all over about a month ago but despite the worst of the WD symptom having stopped I simply cannot sleep.. At all.. and every single night I lie in bed and close my eyes praying that tonight's the night my brain decides to cooperate but it simply just doesn't happen. Even with large amounts of benzos and seroquel - the most sleep i get each night is roughly a hour... As a result 2 weeks off work has turned into a month with has resulted in being fired from my job... I can barley move because im so damn tired and lethargic all the time. The simple act of standing up makes me lightheaded - yet when i put my head back down on the pillow - nothing. No sleep for so many weeks now.. I feel like im slowly losing my mind, going insane.. What began as a mild depression is developing in suicidal thoughts.. Im at the end of my rope here, and i just want it all to end. Id do just about anything imaginable for just one whole nights sleep. If anyone has had similar problems after quitting opiates and perhaps know of any ways that might help me id just be so appreciative - beyond words.. Just writing this took all the energy i have left in me for the day.. so please - any responses will be replied to - just not immediately.. 
Youve all been great to me over the past year in this sub. I hope you all stay safe and well. 
Kind regards

I slowly regain my senses as I realise I've blacked out again, the holes in my memory and the usual uneasy fuzziness of the past surround me. A familiar pounding noise reverberates through my skull, each pulse bringing with it sickening waves of agony. I don't remember the last time I slept, but it was more than 3 days ago. Then I hear the sound I know all too well, that voice in the back of my head, the one that taunts me constantly, telling me about how everyone hates me and how I'm such a disappointment. His voice is soft, gentle almost, but his words are as sharp as razors. Talking of razors, as I move I feel a stinging pain at the tops of my legs. I quickly check and see the dark red lines covering my skin. I don't even remember why I did it that time, but it must have been bad. The pounding in my head intensifies, swelling up to the point it feels like any moment my head is going to burst, like a watermelon that's been left in the sun for too long. I need a way to take away the pain, to make me not care anymore, to silence the hateful words that consume my thoughts. I reach into my bag and pull out the packet of pills, and the bottle of whiskey. They'll do. I slam a handful of them into my mouth and wash them down with the whiskey, the bitter taste tarnishing my mouth as it eases them down my throat. I hate the taste, but then again, I don't drink for the taste. I down another handful of pills and then as much of the whiskey as I can imagine but it's not working fast enough and the pain is taking over. I stand up quickly, and the dizziness hits me, it takes all of my effort to maintain my balance and keep myself upright but I do it, and then I search around for my subutex. I find it, I grab it and a nearby deodorant cap and begin to crush it up. Once it's neatly turned into powder I head to the bathroom and add 70 units of hot water from the tap, before grabbing a cotton bud, ripping the end of and soaking it. I head back to my room, take the cap off of the needle and push it through the cotton, then place it in the water and begin drawing it up. The solution is a cloudy white, which isn't good, it's supposed to be clear but I'm far beyond the point of caring. I tie my arm off and notice how bad it's gotten, bruises and track marks littering the paths of my veins. I push the needle into my skin, the sensation of it entering my vein brings me a sick kind of pleasure. I pull the plunger back, and my thick red blood clouds the solution in the needle, in a beautifully dark way, I loosen the tie and push the plunger down, launching the mixture of my blood and the subutex back into my vein, to my heart, my lungs, and into my brain. The relief begins to spread over me, as one by one my problems fade away. I slide back, the needle falling out of my arm and onto my bed somewhere, and as I fall I use the last of my energy to knock it down the side of my bed. My head hits the pillow as the apathy begins to wash over me. Waves and waves of pure not giving a fuck crash through my body, as my pupils shrink rapidly. Blood leaks out of my arm as I lay there, my breathing slowing, the pounding in my head reduced to nothing, the voice to a whisper. The rush begins for real now, my muscles turn to jelly and the void inside me gets covered up. I'm not complete by any stretch of the imagination, but I no longer care that I'm not. ",1467673708.0

Confused and don't trust Suboxone doc.,"I started IV'ing H about three weeks ago. It quickly went from 1 injection in the evening (maybe half a point) to--at the very end--about 1 point three times a day.

I decided enough was enough and went to see a recovery doc who prescribed me 60 8mg strips of Suboxone. He instructed me to wait 24 hours after my last dose, take an 8mg strip, wait 2 hours and if things didn't approve take another, then repeat until I had hit 24mg. From everything I read this seemed like WAY too much sub, but he has been doing this for a long time and he's well respected.

I did as he directed: waited 24 hours and took a tab. Nothing. I waited 3 hours and took another. Nothing. After I had taken 24mg I thought I might feel a tiny cessation of withdrawal but it could 
have been placebo.

I was in such agony that I ended up relapsing which DID provide relief, which confused me because I thought the Buprenorphine was supposed to block opiates?

PART II:

After talking to my doctor, he told me I just needed to ""keep taking more"" and ""stick it out,"" and prescribed me xanax. He said I should take a ""high dosage"" of xanax to deal with the withdrawal symptoms. Granted the xanax helped immensely with the 
discomfort.

So here I am, on round 2, At 72 hours in. I still was not feeling enough relief, so I relapsed again-- but only a very small amount. My question is this: Can I just pick up the suboxone and keep trying? Or will the small amount of H have effectively ""reset"" my suboxone series.

Please help. :(

EDIT: My doctor prescribed me 90 8m strips and said to take up to 24mg until I felt relief. I am terrified I took too many and messed up my brain chemistry. I am wondering if after my tiny relapse I am okay to go back to like a 4mg strip of suboxone or if that would trigger precipitated withdrawals?

The process is simple you just drink a box of sure jell or in my friends case just jello mix and continue to drink a lot of water. Then pee once or twice to get the dirty urine out and the next time you pee it should be clean. I have been reading about how this works and it seems like the pectin or gelatin leaves your body through poop and when you drink it it takes some of the bile in your stomach with it. This fatty bile is how thc gets into your urine. I'll provide a link that describes how it works to make it clear. My question is would this work for opiates (specifically dope) for a urine screening, it won't be sent to a lab so I'm not worried about the dilution factor and even so my friend who used this method on probation was getting lab tests and he was fine but he didn't use opiates at the time.

You might recall my post yesterday - https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4ra4kf/please_please_help_me_any_advice_or_kind_words/

I just wanted to say thank-you to everyone who responded to my post, i nearly cried reading some of the support you've offered - though, I have been a tired emotional wreck lately so that might have played a part hahah...
Anyways - something wonderful happened last night. I got a FULL night of uninterrupted sleep. No benzos, booze or seroquel required. And since i no longer have a job anymore, when i looked at the clock I realized id even slept in! Anyways heres the rub. I got another bottle of Fentanyl last night - BUT - I only had just one spray up each nostril, and that was it. 10 minutes later, lights out - for at least 12 hours! Now i know what your thinking, relapse right? In a way yes i suppose.. But this morning, when i woke up - the VERY first thing I did was flush the Fentanyl down the toilet. That part wasn't easy, believe me. Standing over the toilet I was staring at the bottle for a few minutes, like Frodo and the One Ring or something lol.. 
Anyways, I did it, because the whole purpose of all this is to get off opiates - but now that Ive had just even ONE nights sleep, I feel amazing. At least compared to before. Now Ive gained the energy to take the advice you've all offered me! Pretty much everything except the Yoga.. Though i might look into it on another day.
I just want to particularly thank a few people -  opidriver420 - gunmetalblue60 - Krewtan - dopiedude - JetSet04 - SteelPicker and Curiousjunkie. I AM taking your advice (and kind words to heart) starting today. 
From just ones nights sleep I've been able to stay completely active. Had a HUGE breakfast as my appetites just had a massive surge which has to be a good thing right? Then I went for a quick jog round the block. Not too far but enough to exhaust me till after lunch. At which point I played the drums - for 5 hours straight! Just rocking out along with my favorite tunes, and smiling every second of the way. Mums taking me out tonight for a walk down to the beach - followed by the bookstore. I need to start reading again - that always helped me get to sleep in the past. A REAL book - not something off a tablet with a bright back-light. Then we are going out for a steak dinner at the pub in town known for having the best steak dinners :) 
Its funny, you guys offered better advice than my own GP did! All he had to say is like ummm.. just keep taking more Valium and Seoquel - that should do it. All it did was make me so groggy just getting out of bed had me walking into walls.. Fuck him. Im not even gonna bother taking it anymore, I dont think ill even need it tonight. Or if I do it would only be like a QUARTER of the dose that i was taking in the previous nights... 
You guys are great and again - to the aforementioned people. I know this place is mostly American (Im from Australia by the way) But I want you to know your advice has been INVALUABLE to me. I want you to know that i truly owe you more than you will ever know. Id hug each and every last one of you if could :) I already know each nights gonna get a little easier from now on... I can feel it. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Get back home and switch phones over. A friend I helped a while ago says she will come bring me a little to pay me bsck.

Feeling pretty down, out and trapped.

27 years old. Live with parents. Thrown everything away. I am living a private nightmare. No one really knows how I feel or what I am up to. Everyone I know that doesn't use, is too caught up in their sucessful lives, while I am kind of stuck in this neverending hell. The only thing I have to really look forward to is getting high, but right now, there is no source of income and I am not going to steal from anyone, I stoped doing that nearly ten years ago. I don't need another reason to feel guilty. 

But seriously I have fucked up everything in my life. I have a girlfriend right now, but she is dealing with her own issues (non drug related). I care about her, and I love her, but I am still hung up on my ex. Long story semi-short, I was with a girl for 5 years, we lived together (had a nice apartment). I was on probation and stuff, but things were going well all things considered. Within three months, I totaled my car and went to prison. I wasn't using is the fucked up thing, I was on methadone but I was following the treatment. Things were stable and everything fell a part. My ex broke up with me about 3 months into my prison sentence of a year. I had been talking to a friend of mine and she ended up coming out to visit me... about two months before I got out we decided that we liked eachother... 

Now, I love the girl I am with, I care about her a lot. When I got out I was IN LOVE with her. But after about 2 months of being out I relapsed on heroin. I haven't been using much, only chipping, but it seems to have changed things and how I feel about things. It brought back feelings about my ex, and I am tormented by it. My ex and I do not talk, but I still feel hearthache. I torture myself by looking at her Facebook, she moved on... 

I feel like a fucking failure. I feel guilty about my use, but at the same time I cannot stop. I don't want to stop. When I am high, it is the only time that I get peace and quiet from all the shit that bothers me. What I really want more than anything is to go back to where I was before I went to prison, but that isn't happening.  I have tried to move on from anything, but nothing I have done has worked.

Totally confused on what to do here. I was ecstatic last night when I thought she was going to get help. I told her I would do whatever is needed to get her better.

Oh my god, I just realised you guys are going to think I meant porn and I literally just thought of it.. I was thinking more about shopping and movies - In the future, 3D printers that are able to create substances down to the molecular level, combined with Virtual reality could have incredible consequences.. My dream would be , instead of picking up for dealers, you load up a movie where you are a cop character in Virtual Reality, you skip to the scene where you have to perform a drugs bust down at the docks.. instead of turning in the evidence, you decide to pop into one of the shipping containers for a quick hit!

It is an inevitability! 3D printing will evolve into Star Trek style replicators and us guys can download baggies that have been scanned (obviously, we will have 'hacked' versions of the replicators that override the illegal banned substance black list).

So... you just paid a FORTUNE for the molecular .CAD file on the dark net market and right now, its downloading and streaming to the replicator..

I don't feel short of breath. Feel like Im breathing really good actually. I feel slightly lightheaded at times. The pain isn't severe either only about a 4-5 at its worst.  Has anyone dealt with something similar?

I have to go to work soon.  Trying to decide if it's serious enough to go to an UrgentCare instead of work this morning.   Sigh Always something.

Getting sick and fucking tired of this, but honestly idk how people can come to any other conclusion when reading through our page. Harm reduction and advice combined with great banter and compassion is what drives this subreddit forward and it's what keeps many of us coming back.

It's inclusive, it's open for all no matter your background or how fucked up you are, you can always find kind people here to get you through it. 

The support I got here when I got clean last time was unreal and it was what kept me from going insane. People PM'd me and talked to me no matter what time a day. I've made friends here that I talk to on a daily basis now, great fucking people.

 Fuck anyone that tries to tell people otherwise, this place is so great and I love it here .

ME: I'm a 33 year old professional that had a 2-3 year long opiate run, in which the last year and a half was full on, aware-of addiction. Up to nearly 150mg oxycodone. Never touched heroin or IV'd anything. Snorted, rectal (mostly) and oral use only.

HISTORY OF RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL: I ended up losing my job last year and ran out my supply and stopped daily use for a year. In that time I maybe took hydrocodone not exceeding about 40mg on 6 or 7 separate days. Took kratom maybe double that many days, and for the most part sober all the rest of the days of that year's time. Was feeling really good but of course that itch was still there, and then BAM a free bottle of oxycodone liquid came my way, as well as some liquid morphine and more hydrocodone. THis past Saturday I invited myself to a controlled relapse. No limits of dosage, but it would only be 3 days long. I was staying in a different town with my gf for a little 4th of July getaway. She had no idea.

Anyway the dosing after all was said and done was:
Saturday: about 18mg total oxycodone, all oral
Sunday: about 28mg oxycodone, 80% of that delivered rectally (and some weed and coffee)
Monday: about 35mg oxycodone, half rectally delivered

I continued to eat healthy during the days I used. Would start my day with a huge salad and some meat, and tried to put at least 20 hours between last dose/first dose of the day.

WHAT I LEARNED: I realized that the ""urge"" wasn't turned on until I started delivering rectally, on day 2. The high was there but not overwhelming. Granted, these aren't doses even close to what I was taking at the height of my addiction. However, I was energized and very confident in public with my gf, and engaged in some old behavior like buying stupid shit I didn't need and itching all parts of my body almost erotically. I wanted to smoke cigarettes badly (and did, about 5 over a 72 hour period, not too bad, I thought), and I reached for weed when the high would start to wane to keep me ""afloat"". I wanted to imbibe myself with anything intoxicating so I naturally reached for coffee as well. I don't take well to alcohol so that was the last thing on my mind.

THE AFTERMATH/RECOVERY: Last dose was this past Monday. All the usual mind tricks came up. Somewhere within 3 hours of last dose on Monday I felt mildly irritated and noticed I was still constipated without the mind-pleasing euphoria. Felt very mild stomach discomfort. I said ""no"" to more, but I knew I could quell it quick if I just did more---but we know where that leads. So I just ate some food and that got it out of my mind. 6 hours after last dose that day, I took some weed and I flew free the rest of the night, eating some pizza with my gf and laughing about the trip. The next day I was still numb and in a ""glow"" after sleeping in like 10 hours. I tried to do some exercise and realized it was too ""easy"", meaning my system was still depressed from the afterglow, so doing my regular high intensity cardio routine concerned me because I wasn't breathing as hard and wasn't feeling the tremendous burn I usually feel, so I stopped early just in case I was masking pain too much (gotta ""feel"" your body when exercising to avoid injury). Today I was irritated, slightly chilly extremities, and a feeling of grogginess on my face as I detoxed the last of last weekend's shenanigans. I don't think anybody noticed at work but this was my toughest day, not in that I wanted to go use again, but because I wanted to be at my high energy level again that I had right before I decided to do a relapse. I don't feel like I ""miss"" oxy right, now, am happy that I didn't keep using over and over like I would have a few years ago, and feel like I'm acting the way I am because I truly value my health more than being high right now, knowing you have to recover from that high. I worked out hard at the gym at about 60 hours from last dose and felt the pain of breathlessness and burn of muscles as it should be, and completed the workout feeling wound up and happy like I should and would have before my relapse. My extremities are warm again and I ate a ton of healthy food afterward and feel pretty much back to about 90% of normal, when just earlier today I was feeling at about a 70%. Just 12 minutes of cardio is supposed to reduce time back to normal endorphin levels by 50% I read somewhere.

QUALITY OF CHIP EPISODE: Was it worth it? I don't know. It wasn't mind blowing euphoria, I'll probably never really get that again unless I chance it with high doses, but I don't want high doses. Makes it harder to stop because you know you have to pay back all the brain-bending you did, and besides, its the low doses that gave us those first experiences right?. Like I said, I took kratom here and there during my ""sober year"" and I never had to spend two days clawing back to normal, but of course kratom is more subtle. So this means I can only do harder opiates AT MOST once or twice a month, if even that. Kratom is sounding better and better, and to be honest, they make weed so strong these days, that might be a better idea. 

SUGGESTIONS TO ALL CHIPPERS: I guess it could be pretty fun taking ""trips to the warm weather"" (which is what I call opiate chipping) every now and then, but limit the usage to one day in a row only---and know, in some way, you will HAVE to pay it all back with a little suffering. This will be hard on extended trips where you want to fly high all the time. I mean, who wants to take a T-break day during a vacation? Also, try to concentrate your dose earlier in the day far before sleep, and do it all at once, safely. This will allow you to wake up in the morning and empty your bowels if the dose wasn't so big to bind you up for days. It is essential you defecate, that's a huge way your body processes everything you're doing to it. Try to intersperse exercise in there too. Don't mix with alcohol. Most importantly, remember to value your baseline life. You shouldn't be trying to chip when you have a medical need for pain medication, or if you have severe mental issues that opiates won't help with, because then you'll be afraid of your baseline---this will not lead to a successful chip or even a chance of one.

Long time lurker first time poster,"My girlfriend (of 2yrs) and I (both reached our breaking point, we were both doing anywhere from 1-200 mg of Roxie a day. I started using a rig the last 2weeks) we have had a rough relationship before we brought our beautiful baby into this world, but have never ever laid hands on each other. Well that all changed last Tuesday. For 4 nights we yelled and cussed and screamed. The first night we were both standing by our back door and she punched me in the face, well out of reaction/dope sick (both excuses) I open palm slapped her, well the screaming went on and on into the morning. We got up the next day didn't speak that morning, later that afternoon I texted her and apologized for how I reacted last night. We seemed to be on a better level, I was meeting my dude later and would get our fix and everything would be fine, right? Wrong. My guy pulls up and we make the exchange and he was on his way. I go in we both snort a whole m30 and I said something, that just made her fly off the handle, I didn't want things to go like they did the night before, so I just didn't say anything back.  I also have two more boys by my ex wife, and one of them is more likely than not, mine biologically. Ex says he's a product of ""rape"" by one of my best friends, I think she's full of shit, but whatever. Either way he is my son and nothing can change that. Back to the baby mama, we will call her Rachel. Rachel is going off on how much of a low down piece of shit I was for ignoring her, and fuck you, and fuck this.. etc. I end up going into my son's room and start watching scooby doo, that they were already watching before bed. Rachel sticks her head in the door and starts yelling ""you favor your other two sons... Excuse me your other one son, because M(youngest) isn't even yours, you need to tell him John is his father, because you sure as fuck aren't. You care more about a bastard kid than you do your own son (infant)""
Thankfully, both of them were glued on the tv, and not her screaming. I give the boys sugar and tell them to stay in their room. I go out and tell her she is acting psychotic and selfish as fuck. She goes on and on how M isn't mine, along with telling me how much of a piece of shit father I am. She went to swing and hit me again, this time I was ready. I grabbed her by both of her wrists and threw her down in the floor. Of course when I threw her she got rug burn on her elbow and I fucked her arm when she landed. Once again the sun came up with my house in an uproar. Luckily the boys slept through it. 
That next day I go to my buddy who has suboxone and I get some from him, at this point I'm through with the pills, I felt my life slipping away. That night, I had taken a full strip all day, I was feeling great, I was happy, I didn't have to be snorting or shooting anything to feel that way. I get home and start telling her about that, and she trips. She got so worked up because she thought since I had subs that i was going to leave her ""high and dry"". She said ""I want to at least get enough to wean down on"" I told her that just because I was taking those didn't mean I was going to let her suffer. Which I wasn't, so that night I got her 4. She did 2 that night, and just before we were about to go to bed, she started getting irritated and in a mood. ""What's wrong now?"", oh God did I regret putting the now in there. She blew up again telling me I beat the shit out of her, and I was a pos blah blah you get the point (if you don't read about the previous nights) so once again I go quiet, not trying to piss her off, but if I don't say anything I can't say anything wrong, right? Nope, I was wrong again. I went to take a shower and she follows me in the bathroom on my heels yelling again. I get undressed and try to get in the shower and she grabs me by the arms and digs her nails into my bicep. I stop and ask her to get her hands off me, she squeezes tighter, I am now screaming it and she just continues, so I break her grip she tries to swing and hit me again, this time I bear hug her barreling through our room and out into the hallway. She is screaming still about how I don't ever just talk, that I always start this and that and I don't talk to her enough and I'm a shitty bf.... I tell her she is a crazy psycho bitch and I slam and loch the door. I take my shower and by this time I'm cooled down so I go sleep on the couch. Wake up the next morning take my half a strip and tell myself that I am done with this shit, her and the dope. I go to her calmly and try to explain my feelings and how neither of us are like this, as well as how I don't know how it got like this, but I don't know that since we crossed that line (becoming physical) that we can ever be ok again. She starts crying hysterically and saying ""just give up then, you know it just the pills"" and so on and so forth. Damn me and my guilty conscience (also an excuse), I end up taking her back, but I asked her if she wanted to get on subs and stay away from the r's. She didn't like the idea so I went and bought another 6 30's for her to ""wean down on"" she also used her arm hurting as an excuse as well. We end up in the worst fight yet that night. She came at me over and over and over. I would wrestle her to the ground and hold her where she couldn't move, then let go and move to the other side of the room, she would come back and I'd man handle her to the bed and asked her if she had enough, we did this four or five times util one time she got up and started to head butt me, well I threw her fucking head into the wall (OMG WHAT HAVE I DONE feeling washed over me, she slumps down the wall close to blacked out. Her scab from the rug burn was stuck on the other side of the wall corner. I knew I had just hurt her bad. She wasn't bleeding from her head or anywhere except the rug burn. She got up, I asked if I could look at her head, she gave me the middle finger and walked out of the room. That night I ended up putting a bandaid on her elbow and checking her head and her eyes (no concussion) the next morning was nothing but I'm sorry's from both of us and how we COULD NOT go through this again. Well we fast forward a few days and have had mild argument but no throw downs, tonight I asked her if it was time for ""sexy time"" she didn't say no, so normally that means hell yeah. We take a shower together and she gets out, then I do. I go and get in bed naked and just watch her put her hair up. She starts walking out the door. I huffed and she came back in asking wtf is wrong with me. I told her I thought we were going to get intimate, she starts going off saying how I don't cuddle with her, and I want from her is sex.. We are now in opposite rooms, because I refuse to get hit on anymore, and I damn well know better than to hit a woman. I just don't know whether her and I could ever make it, or if I'm right and we can never come back after we crossed that line.

Ever since my first time using, when I buy heroin I'll buy a half a gram and snort some every night until I run out. Then I feel like I've gotten my fix and don't use for at least 6 months.

I hear most people saying they start out using once a month then once a week and so on. But since I don't keep any on me and it's a hassle for me to get, I feel like I don't have constant thoughts about doing it. If I were to space out my doses, I admit it would be hard to not use on days when I know I have some nearby,

Is this dumb? It honestly would be nice to space out my use like others but I feel like I would think about using and anticipate using all the time just waiting till the next weekend or whenever. I'm also scared I would use to cope when depressed or whatnot.",1467865851.0

Nice big juicy one, though that hasn't made a big difference for me so far unfortunately. 

I had to tie the tourniquet pretty close to the site of injection in order to avoid a ""pocket"" of a missed shot from earlier today. 

I think I learned that tying the tourniquet close like that is a bad idea. I'm also using a piece of cotton bandage, which I clench between my teeth while shooting. 

I only missed part of the shot this time so I guess that's something to be grateful for.

I think I know what happened but I'm not sure so I wanted to see what you guys think. 

I could really feel the needle puncturing the vein with the cutest little pop. I pushed it in a bit further to secure the needle and let go of the tourniquet between my teeth. 

This released most of the pressure, but not nearly enough. I should have tilted my arm down to allow the tourniquet to unravel. 

I've done a lot of searches both on this subreddit and other forums that google turns up about the many facets of injection and one of the interesting trends I've noticed is that, while every formal guide to injecting advises to release the tourniquet prior to pushing down the plunger, most users say that they never bothered to do this. 

I've been having a lot of trouble with missed shots so naturally I want to do my best to do everything right but in that moment where I had finally had a clean register with thick plumes of red flooding the syringe I couldn't be bothered to figure out how to completely unravel the tourniquet without hands and assumed that just releasing a bit of the pressure would be fine. 

Well it was not fine. I think that the pressure in the vein as I pushed down on the plunger (remember that the site of injection was really close to the tourniquet too) pushed the needle out. 

Because in the middle of pushing down I suddenly got the missed-shot sensation which I've become awfully well acquainted with today. So I'd pull back to see if I would still get blood, expecting to get an air bubble. But instead I still got blood. Weird. 

So I start pushing the plunger again, and it goes well for a few ccs and then the same, suddenly I feel like I'm missing. 

Do you think it's possible that every time I pushed on the plunger the pressure would build up and push out the needle? 

I can't think of any other way to explain this. 

Also, if you have any tips on how I can do my best to prevent these missed shot from forming abscesses I could probably use some advise. I skin popped at around half of 3 shots in the same arm today. Yikes.

GEAR

2x needles - 1cc/100 unit long-tip
2x cotton balls
1x bottle 91% isopropyl alcohol
1x bottled water
2x large spoons
2x G73 - 20mg ER Opana
1x lighter

METHOD

1. File a G73 Opana, snap in half, and crush into fine powder.

- will 10mg be enough? usually bang 3-4 bags of quality ECP

2. Place powder into large spoon, and add 1cc 91% isopropyl alcohol. 

- more than 1cc? would a metal pop bottom work better?

3. Stir occasionally, over a five minute period.

- how long should it soak, and be stirred?

4. Use needle and cotton to remove isopropyl alcohol from pill residue.

- with my initial attempt, was only able to draw 30 units. so much gunk, and quasi-gel

5. Shoot the isopropyl alcohol into the second, unused, spoon.

6. Evaporate the isopropyl alcohol by using the lighter, holding said lighter far beneath the spoon; this will avoid bubbling, boiling, and catching the solution on fire.

- this is the best way?

7. Add 60 units of water to the film coating the spoon, mix, and draw through the second, unused, cotton with the second, unused, needle.

- should more/less water be used? how much film should be coating the spoon, and what color should this mix be?

8. Bang. That. Shit.

But man, I'm still new to this and every time I think I'm getting the hang of it and I start to feel confident something like this happens. 

The vein was pretty much as good as they get. It took me a while to puncture it and be able to pull back blood. Which was odd because it looked like the needle was in. And that's what confuses me most of the time, that from the looks of it, it should be in but I'm not drawing back blood. 

I pull and and go back in a few times and finally draw back blood.  think GREAT! here we go! 

I immediately feel a burning sensation when pushing down so I check to see if it's still in and I could pull a lazy plume of blood in the syringe so I thought I'm good to go. 

I pretty much ended up skin popping almost 50cc 

I get such a mix of emotion when this happens. Like I'm sitting there taking my time, doing everything right and clean (which now that I think of it is actually really good considering I missed) and then at the end everything goes wrong.

My arm feels numb. Is it supposed to do that? It's weird. I feel no pain it just feels swollen and it's slightly red. Right after there were several blister like bumps around the space where I missed and those are gone already.

Painkiller addiction is a serious thing, and I figure this would be the best place to get advice.

Yesterday I was struck with severe back pain (cause is not really known). It was so bad I couldnt move, and i was stuck in bed for like 8 hours in emergency. The doctor gave me 2 doses of IV hydromorphone in a row which allowed me to tolerate the pain enough to be able to get up and walk. So i was allowed to go home. I was prescribed regular tylenol, naproxen, and oral hydromorphone (dilaudid). The dilaudid is to be taken on an as needed basis. But I really want to avoid getting addicted.

I had to take it this morning because I just couldnt get up out of bed. It really does help with the pain but it makes me drowsy, and a little itchy.

So I save it for about 20 minutes until after I have taken my dose and I stick the little yellow pill under my tongue to let it dissolve sublingually (blegh, I forgot how bad alprazolam tastes, klonipin is much tastier) at about 9:50a.m. and I can start to feel some of the effects, although they are quite mild.

I took a couple small sample lines first and then a nice one, followed by the inevitable pincushion effect that happened immediately after I tried the first .07/70mg shot to try it out, .1/100mg, .12/120mg, .11/110mg, .14/140mg and a rinse.

What dosage would you recommend? When I snort I usually do lines of 50mg which gets me good but now my tolerance is extremely low thanks to a long long break from all drugs, so my tolerance is probably totally gone. And I am not that experienced I usually did roxys or dillys.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Diary Entry #1

It was 1pm on a bitterly cold November day when I finally regained consciousness.
Darkness. Pain. Sweat.. or piss? Probably both. Who cares. I shivered as the icy hands
of opiate withdrawal grabbed my spine, clenching and unclenching its fist,
causing painful spasms. 

16 hours. It had been 16 hours since my last shot. That's about 10 hours too many.
I grabbed my cigarettes and lighter from beside my pillow and lit one. It tasted like poison.
They always tasted like poison without heroin. I bought the cheapest, shittiest menthol cigarettes
available, I needed all the money I could get, heroin doesn't supply itself.

I lay in the puddle of greasy sweat, tears, and most likely a bit of urine, staring at the ceiling
as I smoked my cigarette. My legs felt like they were being beaten with tire irons, the muscles like
a rubber band being stretched to its breaking point. I had to move them. It was not a choice.
It seemed like lately none of the things I did were my own choice, but merely something I had to do.

My phone rang, the light blinding my eyes, the ringing screaming into my ears,
adding onto the already monumental pain I was in.
It was Chask. I had been best friends with Chask for going on 8 years now, 5 of those spent doing 
nothing but chasing heroin and cocaine. Mainly heroin.

""Hello?"" I mumbled sleepily into the phone. ""Wake the fuck up Dewey, I need a driver.""
Thank god. What he meant by ""driver"" was someone to take him to his dealer, in exchange for a healthy shot.
""Say no more. I'll be right over, let me get dressed."" I put my cigarette out (that I had forgotten about
in my hazy, pained state, and let all of the ashes fall all over myself and my bed) and began stripping 
my soaked clothes off and trading them for dry ones. Even my socks were drenched at this point.

As I stumbled out my front door I lit another cigarette, and began to take in the crisp, frigid air, its
wind slicing through my thin jacket I stole from some girl I slept with several weeks prior. That
reminded me that I needed to go to the clinic and get the free HIV test done. You never knew with needle fiends.
With people like me.

I arrived at Chask's house about 15 minutes later, my shivering and kicking legs screaming for him to hurry up 
and come outside. Chask has been known to take twenty minutes to ""put his shoes on"". I finally saw his fuzzy,
wild hair, his statement of freedom, or whatever the fuck he called it. ""Come on man, I'm fucking dying in here.""
""All right, all right, calm down, I'm sick too. We're going to Bonnette."" ""Great. If you get shot I'm taking your dope.""
""Fuck you."" ""No thanks, maybe later once I'm nice and high.""

As we headed towards the city, I noticed that Chask seemed a little bit edgier than normal, but I attributed it to 
the dopesick. After all, it's rather hard to be calm when your sweating every lie, mistake, and failure out of you
like a spicket, paying for all of your transgressions through your pores.

As we were pulling up to [redacted]'s house (if you could call it that), Chask turned to me. ""This is gonna be a fast
one, so just leave the car in drive, okay?"" ""All right, I got you."" ""Bet."" He hopped out of the car and headed up to
the front door, tapping three times, then twice, then three more times, the ""secret customer knock"". [Redacted] cracked
the door just enough for Chask to slip inside. 

No more than 30 seconds had passed before Chask came sprinting towards the car, coming from the back of the house 
for some reason. ""What the fuck man, why were you running?"" ""GO. SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GO!"" He didn't have to tell
me twice. I slammed on the gas, my tires screeching as we lurched forward, speeding away from the house and 
whatever fucked up shit had happened there.

We sped all the way back to my house without speaking a word. I knew I didn't need to be sick to hear this.
I unlocked the front door and Chask ducked under my arm and was in the house before I even realized the door 
had opened. He took his kit out, and immediately began prepping a shot. 

""WHAT HAPPENED ASSHOLE?"" Chask didn't even look at me, his attention solely focused on the spoon on the 
counter in front of him, and the 4 stamps and 30 units of water he dumped into it. ""Well, if you're
going to fucking ignore me, at least give me MY fucking shot, you dick."" 

He took 4 more stamps out of the bundle (12 stamps to the bundle, give or take a stamp or two), and handed
them to me. Finally. The misery was about to end, and it would give way to a beautiful, euphoric nothing,
even if only for a moment, until the rush ended and I was left breathless, and still fairly high.

I went to my room and grabbed my own kit. One spoon. Three 28 guage 1/2 inch long needled insulin syringes.
One cigarette filter. One Ampoule containing 3ml of sterilized water. 10 alcohol pads.
I took my spoon out and placed it on the counter in front of me. Chask was already attempting to find
a vein, following the tracks that lined his arms. Marks of heaven. Marks of utter hell.

I took an alcohol pad and wiped the spoon down. I took the 4 stamps (this particular stamp being the Nike
symbol with their slogan ""Just Do It"" underneath it) and dumped them into the spoon, making sure every single
granule made it into the pile. The smell of vinegar hit my nose and made my eyes water slightly. This was going
to be fantastic. Next I took one of the syringes and the ampoule, and drew up 25 units of water, and sprayed it
onto the pile of dope. I watched as it slowly dissolved, the clear water turning a golden brown. I stirred it
once quickly with the plunger of my syringe. It was ready. I was ready.

I took the cigarette filter and ripped a small section off of it, and rolled it into a tiny ball, about the size
of a metal bb, and dropped it into the solution. I watched as it swelled, the fluid staining it a dark mud colored
brown. I placed the beveled edge of the needle on top of it and slowly drew my plunger back, watching the solution
leak into the barrel of the syringe, the small puddle under the cotton disappearing.

The shot was ready. I flicked the barrel with my middle finger several times to make any air bubbles rise to the
top, and then pushed the remaining air out. I took my belt off and wrapped it around my left arm, just above 
the elbow, pulling it tight with my teeth. I flexed my arm and pumped my fist, watching as my veins rose to the 
surface, thirsty, desperate for what was to come.

I found the perfect vein, grabbed another alcohol pad and wiped the spot I intended on hitting. Abscesses
are not fun, and this simple step can save a lot of pain and hassle, not to mention another ugly scar.
I made sure the beveled end of the needle was facing up, and slowly inserted it into my arm. I felt a slight
pop as the tip punctured my vein. I pulled back on the plunger slightly, and watched with almost sexual lust
as my blood mixed with the ichor, swirling, mesmerizing me like nothing else ever has, or ever will.

I released the belt from my mouth, the pressure easing up so that I didn't blow a damn vein (also not fun).
As I slowly pushed the plunger down and watched as the heroin and blood mixture transferred from the barrel
directly into my bloodstream, I could feel the sickness leaving me. My muscles immediately relaxed, the icy
hands releasing their hold on my spine. I knew what came next.

I pulled the needle out of my arm, put the cap back on, set it down, and it hit me. That indescribable 
feeling. That weightlessness. That bliss. That pure, comfortable warmth that starts at the top of your 
head and melts, dripping and pouring down your entire body all the way to your toes. 


I took several steps back and hit the wall behind me. In my enraptured state I let myself slide
down the wall until my ass hit the ground, and I was sitting with my head leaned back, my mouth
hanging open. This is what I lived for. And honestly, probably what I was going to die for, I thought.

If I had only known.

I had a terrible experience the other day and just need to air it out here anonymously.  I have been a user of pharms for maybe 5 years, have never tried anything stronger than morphine or U47700.  Met someone who sold me what was supposed to be U47700 from the street.  I now believe that was heroin.  I have never come close to OD'ing, have been very safe, but I sniffed a tiny amount of the ""U47700"" and within a second felt very high, felt dizzy, and then passed out.  My fiance was with me, we were in the car, she gave me CPR until the ambulance showed up.  I was out cold, drooling, stopped breathing, lips turned blue, though I had a pulse and high heart rate the entire time.  When the paramedics came to the door I guess I woke up but I don't remember that.  My only memory is of being in the ambulance and waking up, being very confused, the paramedics yelling at me ""where did you get the drugs??""  They told my fiance my vitals were fine except my heart rate was high, for some reason they thought I had taken ecstacy, not sure why.  I believe they hit me with narcan though I am not positive, as I think I was hallucinating at this point.  I remember them telling my fiance they might lose me and I might die but apparently that was never said to her, so I don't know how great my memory is.  I told them I was sold U47700, they pumped me full of fluids and possibly narcan, I felt like shit, kept puking on the way to the hospital.  When I got to the hospital was grilled by the paramedics, one told me ""you're lucky you didn't die today.""   

Am feeling really fucked up about the whole thing.  I don't know how close I really was to dying or if the paramedics were just trying to scare me straight but it worked, they did scare me.  

So everyone please be safe out there.  I only snorted a tiny amount of this substance and it did this to me, I know it was not U47700 and was likely heroin from the looks of it.  I have never done heroin and this is probably why it had this effect on me.

I already searched and am pretty sure I may as well throw them in the trash but am hoping there's something... anything I can do with these. Here are my questions:


1) Is dremel still pretty much the only way people have found for trying to grind these up for powder? Not interested in trying to IV/plug.

2) IF eating is the only option, is it really as bad as people describe? Or do people just say this because oral BA is so low RELATIVE to other methods? I was under the impression that if snorting/IVing oxymorphone was somewhere between 5-10 times as potent as an equivalent-mg dose of oxycodone, then eating it would AT LEAST give you a 1:1 mg ratio to oxycodone. Is this wrong? For anyone who has eaten/chewed these, how would they equate a 40mg puck to oxycodone in terms of mg dose?


3) Is there any difference between swallowing the puck whole versus chewing it as much as possible / dissolving it in coke? Maybe at the very least the time release could be partially defeated..

Anyways, if you have seen it, does anyone else think Ryan's character without pills/with pills is similar to an opiate addict with their drug/without their drug, respectively?

When he's takes his prescribed psychotic medication he sees his life as it is, is overwhelmed with sadness and fear and loniliness. When he refuses to take the medication (which, btw, he does so listening to his cat, obviously an embodiment of his dark thoughts, and that's also similar to opiate addicts tying to quit and fighting the mental temptation) he's euphoric, everything is okay and magical, he doesn't have to deal with any of his issue or responsibilities, he can just do whatever he wants and ""deal with it in the morning,"" as his cat suggests.


Anyways, anyone here seen it? Anyone make that comparison as well watching it? Or at least see it now?

Marjane Satrapi is brilliant (check out Persepolis as well), and Ryan Reynolds, and the entire cast come to think of it,

Use to do about a bundle a day or around half gram of raw but past 4-5 months i've drastically reduced tolerance to around .1 to .2 a day. Somedays I do maybe .2ish. I'll split it into 3 doses so I get more out of it). Ok so basically my main connect has seriously had a quality drop past few months... He use to always have fire/ atleast good no matter what but lately it's been very very weak. So when to mess with a old connect haven't messed with in atleast a year and a half. The stuff I got was an off white in certain like it has a like tiny bit of cream white look to it but in other light its just bright white almost if that makes any sense lol. Anyway when I did it I did about .05 in 1 line and it hit VERY quick. Usually takes about 10mins for me to feel a good deal from anything but this was veryyy fast. Said fuck it and did another .05 line so .1 total and ran up to the store to drop buddy off some money. All the sudden on way back like... 15mins later my head was fucking rushing couldnt hold my eyes open and felt suuuper just fucked up. The reason it was weird to me is it wasan't like a nice warm cozy feel great fucked up, it kinda felt like I had just drink 10 shots of liquor in 3minutes type fucked up. Was real dizzyish and shit...The main thing was tho after about 50mins the high was really fading ( still felt good) and started to get very sick to stomach ended up throwing up.. and I never throw up. But afterwards I started getting veryy sleepy. What's weird is when I do shit real strong especially later in the day i'll end up being up all night like I don't want to sleep I want to just enjoy my high and I get that good rush of energy.. This was more like I was really struggling to stay awake and although I felt good it wasan't alot of euphoria to it. Was more just like a relief to feel anything other then just normal but fuck it reminded me of sniffing a dillaudid 4mg with less euphoria back when I had 0 tolerance to opiates ( the days when a 5mg vic would put me into nod land lol)",1468074569.0

(A long Day-in-the-life Story),"People seem to enjoy reading my posts, or posts in general, about 'a day in the life' the elaborate plots to score that seems to turn into film script level farce... although they usually result in a happy ending (or an unmitigated disaster, either way!).

  
Well, here's a quick one.
So, two days ago my usual guy wasn't picking up.. back on in the morning. Nope, I can't wait that long - so armed with £20 (one standard bag or 2 small ones) I leave my front door and begin to wander the streets. Now, in all honesty, this is the quickest way to get fucked over, you have to stay sharp and plan how you see it going in your head and stick to it. Don't get talked into anything, no deviation from the plan YOU have, don't listen to to the punk you're with - its YOU meeting a dealer. None of that 'I have to do it, he's paranoid' It's usually some runner kiddie and he doesn't give a fuck, he just wants his cash. So, yeah, this is also the best way to lose money but gain a new phone number when you let someone use your phone.   

My bullshit detector is now honed to perfection. When you find someone that agrees to help you in exchange for a bag - its at that point you have to listen to every word they say for contradictions or general shit. Look, I don't know why they get greedy and fuck people over, I can't be fairer than splitting half my cash for nothing. A minute before meeting me they had nothing, now they're getting a bag. They can go back to begging or whatever it was they were scamming to rustle up cash straight after. I don't know if its a superiority thing, fuck you with money.. come down here to my streets and 'using me' for what you want. Seriously, I'm only 2 steps away from being on the streets myself. I'm in McDonalds posting this because I don't have internet, TV, anything.. I live in a 2 room rental (bathroom, bedroom) that my parents are paying for because I've fucked up so badly, I'm not exactly privileged right now. and when it was really bad, I've been where you are!S till, they never ask, just assume. Well, that's one theory. Another is that they're just greedy lunatic crackhead cunts that would step over their own mother for another rock. There's no trust, no loyalty, no kinship for people in the same position as you where you do what you can for eachother.. I think some even think they're clever for screwing someone over, gaining trust, then fucking them over.. makes them feel superior for a few moments. (See a previous post of mine about another Day in The Life where I caught the guy scheming to screw me over with his friend while I was with him!)

Its horrible.. its fucking cut throat down here and it makes me feel sick that I'm in it all. Its such a shame this drug has all these terrible connotations associated with it.. but its easy to see why. Perhaps the people using it that aren't at the bottom where I have to scrape around are buying in bulk, having it delivered to them in their marble floored mansions while their butler brings them ready made shots they can do laying in a bubble bath with gold taps and a glass of champagne (for some reason).

Anyway, I live near the center of where the night life in my town. So, I walk out my front door, it take 15 minutes and then I'm where the action is. I head to the main taxi rank. There are people everywhere. A lot of the bars, pubs and clubs are in the area and there are usually homeless people begging here due of the flow of people coming through to get taxis home. The noise is quite intense as there are bars nearby playing music, a lot of people are drunk and shouting or talking and laughing in groups. At the end of the taxi rank there is a guy sitting on a flat cardboard box, he's asking for spare change as people are queuing to get their rides. I lean against a shop window a few feet away and ask.. ""Hey man, how you doing"" *3 sentences later, once we have established a dialogue* ""So uhh... know where I can get any dark*"" (*H slang in the UK)   

   
""I don't know you bruv"" *He immediately stops talking to me* ""Hey man, I'll get you one if you can help me, I'm getting ill, my guy ain't around and I'm desperate"" After hearing about the one for him, he changes his tune.. ""You ain't police?"". I don't know if its my 'posh voice' (South of England Represent Yo!) or it's that I  have a trustworthy face instead of the opposite of Heroin chic! Not the standard street junkie look - ie. dirty grey tracksuit, filthy hands and fingernails, unkempt hair, a short - burnt rusty looking beard, occasional black-eye and no teeth. You know, that look.. Anyway, I always get asked the question, as if the police are dumb enough to use informants that dress in a suit and tie and in their best Hugh Grant voice say ""Excuse me my fine dwellingless fellow, might you be able to procure me some of the finest *crrraaack* my currency might afford me, naturally I will remunerate your undertaking of this transaction""

Anyway.. he borrows my phone, makes one call, aaaaand we're off! We start walking - fortunately for me, back towards my dwelling! On the way, he talks about losing his wife to an OD, why he has a crutch (blood clot) and we laugh about how we still do this shit to ourselves despite the madness that comes with it. Zero bullshit alarms. Everything bodes well. Not once does he try to re-assure me that this will all work out. I actually have to ask *him* about splitting it. But he tells me it's okay, there's no need, they will come as 10s so I can just give him his one. He doesn't ask for the money, he says I can do the deal, he will even introduce me and I can take his number and use him in the future. Another Dr. to add to my contacts list! (I keep all my dealers together under Dr. in my phone. Dr. Dboy, Dr. Sketch, Dr. Zach, Dr. Flex, Dr. Frosty.. they come and go faster than I delete them so my phone is filled with people that have disappeared over the years. I'm very sick, I have like, 100 doctors).

We meet the guy (Dr. Frank) do the deal in an alley and I hand him his one, he thanks me and walks off. I'm now ironically 50 meters from my house. I don't even live in a bad area, I am realising recently just how much smack there is in this town. It's insane. I was heading home last week and in front of me was a guy with a Red Pack sticking out of the pocket of his hoody (A Red Pack is all the needles and equipment needed - you can walk into any pharmacy in the UK and ask for.) So we reach my road, he meets a black guy on the corner, and follows him into a house opposite my front door. Deals be goin' on in there! Everywhere I tell you!! 
  
I have to wonder whats going on with people since the legal high ban across the country that happened in May. Some of them were really addictive, I've met multiple people that have gone back to using H after getting off Spice (The legal synthetic cannabinoid) since it was banned, but they all said that the withdrawal was 10x worse than opiates - they were on H before somebody offered them a joint of Spice, which they tried then immediately couldn't stop and switched over to it - going through H withdrawal and spending their money on Spice!? That's crazy.. Anyway, the amount of people that have must have been forced into withdrawal are all left with a big hole in their using life.. I expect standard weed and maybe even harder drug sales have skyrocketed. Or.. everybody got clean, got jobs and are now productive members of society that have a beer on Friday night and go to bed early, just like the government predicted would happen.

So. I walk the 50 meters home, lights on, open the plastic wrap, it looks totally different to my usual chunky grey chips, this is more brown powder.. I smell - it checks out, quick smoke test on foil - its real, so I'm happy! It keeps me good til the next day at least and I can sleep instead of tossing and turning all night in a sweaty bed.   

Also, hey! A new personal best. Out my front door, find a heroin dealer and back to my home in under 40 minutes.

2 days later, the same scenario. My usual guy, phone switched off - means back on in the morning. I try the new contact - phone is off, same deal. It is 10.30pm on a Friday night. I should have got it earlier but its taken me all day to get the cash.

I try and find the guy at the taxi rank - he had other numbers, it just so happens the first one we tried worked. No avail.

I take a walk and see a guy on a crutch hassling people for money outside a club. I walk up to him ""Hey, Mark?"" It was dark and I couldn't quite see his face so I just start talking ""Hey, remember me, I think we met a couple of days ago going to meet Frank for a couple of dark"" 

It wasn't the same guy, but he heard dark and said he could help, his guy, Dr Justin, does 3 for £25 so if I buy my 2 dark (smack!), he can get himself a light (crack!). Some alarm bells.. its very unlikely that he's going to want to do that without the crack to come down with. These drugs do go hand in hand after all.. Fly high and parachute back down, otherwise you smash into the ground in a rather horrible way. I offer him one for helping but he refuses, he says he just wants his one. Interesting? But okay, I agree. He borrows my phone, makes the call and we're off.

But during the walk to meet the guy, all these lines start flying out his mouth - as they know they're about to screw you over, they can almost taste the success and they want to ensure it all goes to plan so they completely over-reassure you every step of the way. Here comes the bullshit that begins to set off alarm bells - talking about how the deal is going to go down ""You give me the money, stand just round the corner as the guy is paranoid and won't serve us both, only me. I'll come straight over and give you your half"" *KLAXONS, ALARM BELLS, SIRENS*   

He begins to tell me how he's definitely NOT going to screw me over. Numerous other things, .. I'll add them if I remember them.

Another thing about crack heads, even if they're not on it, boy do they talk fast. This guy couldn't shut up, inbetween reassuring me and pacing around asking where the guy was who was coming to meet us (it had literally been 12 seconds since we arrived at the road we were told to go to)

More bullshit.. I'm about to walk because I can't stand this tension any longer and I really need this to pay off. Then suddenly, he spots the runner, a bald, old man at the other end of the road, we also see two other guys running towards him. ""I know those guys"" he says. 

This is where it gets frantic and weird. The other two guys get served first, the lunatic next to me says ""Give me the money"". I told him no, we'd see the guy together. ""Give me the FUCKING money"". NO. No .NOOO.. He asked 8-10 times in an increasingly loud, insane and screaming manner. But I'm not giving him shit until we meet and talk to this bald guy who has now started running away.. ""YO!!!!"" he screams after him ""It's RICKY.. WHERE YOU GOING"" The guy was like a train that didnt stop at the station, the other guys exchanged cash for drugs on the move, the guy never stopped and now he was running away. Man-on-crutches- Ricky asks to borrow my phone. He calls the guy and asks what the hell is going on.. mean time the two guys come over and are screaming ""MUTHAFUCKER"" randomly and making threats. They've been stung. There was nothing in the bags and they've lost all their money. I turn to Ricky and say 'See, I've saved you your £5 and my £20. These guys have been stung"". Ricky tells me that I haven't saved him shit.. Okay. The two guys walk off looking to smash someones face in. Ricky tells me that those guys ripped the dealer off last time, so they recovered their money and ripped them off. The whole thing just reeks of scam. I'm sick of this asshole. His mood elevated from somewhat calm, to angry and impatient some 20 minutes ago and never came back down again. He won't give me my phone back. ""I've organised it. We're going to wait here for him to come back and we're not moving"" I ask again for my phone back, because.. fuck this.. I'm preparing to leave. He won't give it back ""Look, I' told my woman I'd be out for 20 minutes and I need to tell her where I am"" Worth a try, I though. He gives me back my phone. ""I need to take a piss, wait here"" That didn't work! He starts following me as I point toward a pub ""I'll be in here, two seeconds"".. He's screaming now, I can feel his presence as he paces up right behind me. ""You muthafucker, you better not fuck me over. Give me the fuckign money"" Yeah, there's no way I'm getting shit from this transaction, this guy is nuts and I think the shouting is about to escalate... he grabs my shirt and pulls me right up to him, picks up his crutch and whacks me with it. Yup. It escalated. ""GIVE ME THE FUCKING PHONE AND THE MONEY, NOW!!"" Some back and forth pushing I'm defending myself from combo crutch attacks. Broken foot.. hmm.. The moment I'm free from him grabbing my clothes I turn and fucking LEG IT. I don't turn round, but I hear him start.. he shouts at a crowd of people ""Stop him!"". Shit, like I'm the thief? Luckily they don't hear. I'm hopign the crack has destroyed his lungs and I run until I can't breathe. I take the long way home - pouring with sweat. I get home, strip naked and take a few loperamide so I can sleep. Luckily I get a text at 9am from my usual guy: 'On'.   

  
I'm not sure how well I described the frantic, sketchy, crack-o. It was scary going from buying shit with someone you don't know to actual violence. Other times (and it doesn't happen often, I've learned to be careful after being burned - and I don't understand it, I've offered to help people long term if they help me, they'd be sorted for a while but instead they choose the instant hit of screwing someone over.) I've just been shouted at. I've had people all up in my face, but they haven't put their hands on me. This guy wanted my money.. REAL BAD! It was sad to know that after I was gone, he'd be right back to hassling nice people on the streets out on a Friday and would probably get enough out of them to get more crack.

But it makes me glad I don't do the white myself. I always quite like it if I have extra money and I'm comfortable with the amount of dark I have to stay well - then the crack on top is at least a little treat. But dealing with the dark side vs the light side, dark side seems like reasonable (but sweaty) people more often than not. Throw in crack and people losing their goddamn minds. It seems to make people crazy, violent, schizophrenic in their behaviour.. I was in rehab once and met the most softly spoken, polite, unassuming little shy guy ever.. He told me when he was addicted to crack he was violently pimping out his girlfriend. It was like The Other Guys, Will Ferrall for some reason is really good with women despite being a total loser because he was a pimp in his past - totally unexpected.

Funniest bullshit line he fed me.. ""I broke my foot saving someones life""

I cannot express how much I appreciate all of the positivity and support to keep writing, it truly means the world to me. I haven't actually been proud of anything in a long time, and I thank you all for granting that to me. When I posted that original story, I didn't actually plan on it being a series, I just wrote a short piece to get some feelings out, and it was enjoyed enough that you guys convinced me to keep going with this particular story, so, without further adieu, here's entry #2.
_________________________________________________

Entry #2: What The Fuck Chask

I opened my eyes and saw nothing but my ceiling. Shit, I knew that shot was going to be strong, must
have nodded out. I looked to my right and saw Chask sitting in my recliner, a cigarette butt and 
too many ashes laying on his pants, a fresh burn hole added to the sea of underwear-backed polka dots.

I slowly rose to my feet, not failing to notice the horrible stiffness in my neck. I walked over to
Chask and clapped my hands in front of his face. ""Yo, wake up, you have some explaining to do.""
""What.. fuck.. huh?"" Chask mumbled as he blinked his bloodshot eyes slowly, readjusting to consciousness.

""Tell me what happened back at [Redacted]'s house, why were you running outta there like Usain Bolt on shard?""
""Fuck.. All right. Jesus."" Chask dug in his hoodie for his cigarettes, pulling out and lighting the last
one, discarding the empty pack on my carpet, along with the ashes and butt sitting in his lap. Dick.

He looked at me, and I could tell he was genuinely disturbed, and this is an uncommon thing. Chask has seen
a lot of shit, it takes something heavy to shake him up like this. ""This remains between us. To the grave.
Okay?"" ""Yeah man, just tell me."" He took a long drag off his cigarette and sighed as he exhaled.
""You know how I owed [Redacted] for that bun last wednesday?"" ""Yeah, you said you paid him back Saturday.""
""Well, that.. I might have been.. stretching the truth.."" He looked at me sheepishly.

""What the fuck does that mean Chask?"" I was beginning to become legitimately worried at this point.
""Well, I didn't exactly pay him back Saturday.. Not with money. I.. I did a favor for him, and he wiped 
my debt, and added an extra bundle on top of that."" ""What kind of 'favor' Chask? Did you fuckin' whack
somebody? You look like you saw Lucifer himself fucking your mother."" Chask was visibly trembling at
this point, beads of sweat beginning to form across his brow.


""I.. I fucking blew him okay!"" he spat before he could stop himself. He started a staring contest with
his worn out Chuck Taylors. We sat in silence for what felt like an eternity before I exploded with
laughter. ""You WHAT?! What the fuck Chask!"" He finally looked up from his shoes and tried weakly to 
defend himself. ""All my hussles were dead, I was so broke I couldn't even buy smokes! He was threatening
to send one of his 'goons' to 'collect another form of payment', and I for one like my fucking kneecaps man!""

I sat shaking my head at Chask in utter disbelief. We've been desperate before, but I had never seen him
sink to this level. ""Well, how does that relate to today?"" I asked suspiciously. ""Well.. we set up another
deal. If I did it again he would give me a brick this time.. but on the way over there I knew I just couldn't
bring myself to do it. My kneecaps were safe, you know? So I had no idea what to do. I couldn't just tell you
to turn around!"" I felt like I saw the general direction this was headed.

""So.. you..?"" ""Well, when we were about 5 minutes away I had my plan figured out. I was going to demand the
brick up front before I started."" I arched an eyebrow at him. ""And if he had said no, sucky suck first?""
""Well, I was almost positive he'd say yes, I mean he had no reason to not trust me, and I had many to not
trust him. And I.. I think he really.. wanted it."" I was almost sweating trying to contain my laughter, for
his dignity's sake. I did feel bad for him, he was my best friend after all. 

""Anyway,"" he continued, ""after I had the brick, I was going to proceed as normal, right?"" ""Right, I'm not
seeing what fucked up here man."" ""Well, about 10 seconds after.. *it*.. was in my mouth, I was going to bite
that motherfucker and haul my 134 pound ass out of there like my life depended on it. Because, well, it did.""

I stared at him with my mouth agape. I could not believe what I was hearing. My laughter was starting to turn
into respect, that shit took some balls (no pun intended). ""So you bit his fucking cock off?!""
""Not off! Just.. mangled it a little bit.."" He resumed his staring contest with his shoes.

""So, let me get this straight. You got the brick up front, he whipped it out, you did your thing for a few seconds.. and bit his
fucking dick. How did you get out without him murdering you?"" ""That's where the genius in my plan comes into
play!"" He was actually smiling now, proud of his accomplishment. ""I only blew him as long as it took for me to
tie his shoelaces together!""

""That is.. pretty fucking smart, actually. Really sick, depraved, and somewhat cruel, but pretty fucking smart.""
""I know, right?"" He grinned at me. I could tell his shame was almost completely gone, replaced by pride in his
incredibly risky, ill thought out plan. 

""You can't fucking tell ANYONE this happened, please man, I beg of you.""
""Your secret is safe with me. As long as you give me another bun, I'd hate for Lisa to find out you spit shined
your dboy's chocolate rod."" I gave him a sly wink, he knew I would do it. We were best friends, but when it came to dope, we fought like
nemeses. 

He had been in love with Lisa since elementary school, almost 15 years ago now. They had briefly
dated in sophomore year of high school, but after he shit his pants one day during lunch (incidentally, it
happened because we had done far too many lines of coke in the bathroom just beforehand), she promptly
dumped him and proceeded to pretend that she had no idea who this sweaty, shit-pants'd freak was. He has since
then been actively trying to win back her love.

""No! Don't you fucking tell Lisa you asshole!"" ""Give me another bun then, shaft waxer."" ""Fine.. only if you don't
tell Lisa.. and quit calling me fucking names you prick!"" ""Aww, are your little feelings hurt?"", I mocked in a
baby voice. ""Shut the fuck up man. You know I don't joke around when it comes to Lisa!"" I could hardly blame him,
she was as beautiful as she was disgusted by Chask. That's a lot, if you couldn't tell. 

""I know you don't, do I look like I am either?"" ""No, you don't. I know you well enough to know when you're full
of shit by now, Dewey."" ""Yeah, but don't you love me for it?"" ""Not really."" ""Oh well!"" We were both grinning 
ear to ear by now, the air completely clear of any tension created by his less than savory story. 

""Come on
man, let me drive you home, today has been tiring and I need to go to sleep, I have to wake up hella early
in the morning to take my little brother to get his fucking eyes examined since both my parents will be at work.
The blind little fucker backed into my mom's Jetta last week."" ""All right man. Let me bum a smoke since you held
my secret ransom for my dope."" 

As we were headed to Chask's horrible bright yellow house with brown shutters, we were in a genuinely good mood.
Audioslave was on the radio, the heat was cranked, we had taken shots for the road, and we had dope for wake
ups (this was rare, we were accustomed to waking up dopesick). I couldn't help but notice the same car had been
behind us for quite a few miles.

""Yo, Chask, that car has been behind us since we turned on Poplar."" ""Really? Ah, whatever, don't worry about it
man, just chill out, we're almost to my house anyway."" ""Yeah, I guess you're right, I'm just being paranoid.""
As we pulled up to the curb in front of Chask's house we were both relieved to watch the car that had been
""following us"" keep on driving by.

""Told you man, no need to freak."" ""Yeah, we're cool. Anyway, goodnight staff-master!"", I chuckled.
""Hey, I told you to quit calling me names! That was part of the deal!"" ""You're right, I'm sorry,"" 
I smirked. I loved chask. He may be a crazy, cock sucking son of a bitch, but I loved him.

""Goodnight Dewey. Thanks for not being too hard on me tonight."" ""No problem man. After all, I have a wake up 
shot for once, who am I to judge!"" ""Yeah, a wake up shot you extorted out of me!"" ""All is fair in dope and war,""
I laughed, wagging my finger in his face. ""Fuck you man. Goodnight."" ""Goodnight man. I'll call you af-"" I was cut
short by the sounds of shattering glass. 

We ran from his front porch to my Jeep and saw glass shards glimmering 
in the moonlight behind it, the car that had been tailing us speeding off. My back windshield was smashed out 
completely. ""WHAT THE FUCK?!"" ""Shit man!"" We looked at each other grimly. We both knew what just happened.

As for me, i've had pain in the upper right side of my stomach for about 3-4 years now (been using about 5 years pretty consistantly) that comes and goes daily. It's a slight throbbing pain that is worse sometimes more than others, and today was one of the more painful days, and it caused me to have a massive panic attack at work which obviously made everything worse. I, like many of you, do not have health insurance, and even when i've thought my gallbladder was exploding (due to the little bit of pain and a lot of paranoia) i'd wait it out and i'd be fine. i'd say a lot more but i'm nodding my bairns out, so i'll end it with another question.

I took heed since then and haven't touched them. 

But I don't know how long I can keep away from the temptation of trying something new. I don't think it's a willingness to get fucked up, I have all the alcohol I would want to drink and all ways to get pot. I think it has to do with the forbidden fruit factor of it. I've been telling myself I shouldn't do it due to the morality of the situation and the risk. 

Never mentioned it in my previous post but I was a daily stoner for a year before work found out and drug tested me. I was stuck in a program (that they made me pay for) and told I had to attend NA for 3 months. All while they cut my hours due to a conflict I was having with a new manager who saw my work as ""inefficient"". Needless to say I left after 2 years of working there. 

That anecdote should be enough to stop me from testing the waters. It truly should. But every night while this couple is gone and my girlfriend falls asleep I ponder it. I look at the little white pills and picture an evening of bliss only to compare it to that album of people whom have OD'd, that ""so what I'm a dope feen"" chart, and the many stories of posters who want so much better lives for themselves but can't escape the game. 

I guess my question is this. I may never stop trying drugs, for in this life we're given the opportunity to experience everything which lays before us until the clock runs out. Am I alone here as a person whom is fascinated with opiates and the sunshine it gives but is fighting an eternal struggle not to give them a taste? I don't even know if they would give me what I'm looking for. I've yet to try MDMA or speed or true medical grade cannabis. Multiple drugs have shown me so much and I would hate to find one and spend a chunk of time and money on just that one category alone. 

Forgive this long useless rant. Just don't have anyone else to talk to about this particular situation.

(x-post /r/drugs),"Long story short: I am very experienced with drugs and proper measurement. I carefully weighed out 20mg of Fentanyl HCL on a milligram scale and triple checked the weight (Margin of error is about 5%). I put this into 100ml of heated saline solution and mixed vigorously dozens of times over the course of an hour.
Now the dilemma: I took .3ml (about 60ug of Fent) on an empty stomach (oral, mixed into a shot of soda) follow by 30ug 90 minutes later. I still didn't feel anything an hour later and took another 40ug. It's been 90 minutes since then and I barely feel any effects.
Obviously I want to tread lightly with a substance this dangerous. I got it from an extremely reliable source (it isn't acetyl) and did all of the measurements correctly. I know that most people don't do fentanyl orally, but I would still be inclined to think that I would feel more effects than I currently am after consuming 140ug (I have a fairly low opiate tolerance.)

He told me that he started slinging black tar to support his habit. And that he's carrying RIGHT NOW. and that the first one is free! (Gotta love that..) My wife was out of town as well, so it made for the perfect scenario. I was blasted all weekend long and it was amazing. Nodded my fucking face off to the point where I tried packing a bong hit about 5 separate times and would drop it, spilling ganja everywhere. Needless to say, it was a very fun weekend.

I just chatted with him and we may hang this evening. I asked him what he's holding and this was his list:

-Black tar

-OP 30's

-Adderall 30's

-Kratom

-Dilaudid

-Subs

-Blow

Entry #3: An Offer I Couldn't Refuse

As we stood outside Chask's ugly fucking house, my first reaction upon seeing my broken back windshield was: ""THOSE FUCKERS
BROKE MY WINDSHIELD!"" My second: ""YOU GOT MY FUCKING WINDSHIELD BROKEN, CHASK!"" ""Shit man, I'm so fucking sorry, I didn't
know he would have even SEEN your Jeep, let alone retaliated against YOU! I'll pay to have it fixed, I promise!"" That was
bullshit, and we both knew it, because, you know, heroin.

""What the fuck have you gotten me into Chask? How connected is this guy? How many 'goons' does he have that were willing
to break your kneecaps last saturday?"" ""I don't know man! I know he has at least 3 directly beneath him, maybe more under
them."" ""And above him?"" ""..That's the part I'm worried about."" ""What does that MEAN CHASK?!"" ""I didn't think they would 
flip their shit over a brick! A brick is nothing to these cats!"" ""Yeah, I'm sure it isn't, but people have been killed
for a lot less man!"" ""I know man. FUCK, I know!"" ""If they did this to my Jeep, how far do you think they're willing to
go to get revenge on YOU, Mr. Cock Bite?"" I could see tears beginning to well up in Chask's eyes. Shit.

""I'm sorry man, I'm not even mad at you, I'm honestly just scared. For you as much as myself."" ""It's okay man, I'm
scared now too,"" Chask sniffled. ""We can't show them we are though, they'll use that against us and just terrorize us
until we kill OURSELVES."" ""Yeah.. but what do you suppose we do?"" ""Fuck.. I don't know man. On one hand, this windshield
will probably cost more to replace than a brick is worth. But, on the other, you bit the guy's dick in his own home.""
""Yeah, but he's not gonna tell anyone that!"" ""True, but that doesn't matter, he'll come up with some bullshit reason.
He just wants revenge."" ""Probably. Shit, let's go inside and get high.."" ""Don't have to twist my arm,"" I said, already
walking through his overgrown front yard towards the peeling front door.

Three days had passed, and nothing else had happened yet, so we continued our lives as normal, although we were far
from comfortable, our eyes constantly peeled. My parents lended me enough money (that we all knew I was never going 
to pay back) to repair my windshield. Before I got the guys to fix it, I decided to clean up the remaining broken
glass all over the inside of my trunk and back seat (I had an open trunk in my '05 Jeep Liberty), so that they
wouldn't cut themselves or anything.

After I finished with the back seat, I went around back and opened up the trunk. There, amongst the shards of my 
poor windshield, was the cinderblock that they had thrown through it. Seeing it resparked my anger, and mild feelings
of resentment towards Chask for dragging me into this mess because he decided a brick (minus four bags and a bun) 
was worth nearly biting his dboy's cock off. ""Motherfuckers..,"" I grumbled, picking up the block carefully, trying
to avoid cutting my hands on the broken glass. On the bottom of the block was a piece of paper taped to it on all
four sides. It read;

11/18/13

1784 McDowell Ave.

$10,000

Shit. That was in four days.

Abandoning the glass, I went back inside and called Chask to tell him I was coming over. ""Hey asshole, we're fucked, I'm
coming over. Now."" As I arrived at his dreadfully yellow house, he was on the front porch smoking a cigarette waiting on me.
""What do you mean 'we're fucked', what happened?"" ""This happened."" I unlocked my trunk and opened it, beckoning him over.
""Look. On the bottom."" Chask looked confused as he flipped the block on its side, realization dawning on him as he
continued to read. 

""You're right. We are fucked."" ""No shit."" ""Where the fuck are we supposed to come up with TEN GRAND?!
I just bit the motherfucker's schlong for a brick!"" ""I don't fucking know man, you tell me, you got us into this fucking mess!"",
I snapped. Chask turned to me. He looked sad. More sad than I've seen him in a long time. ""I'm sorry Dewey.. I never meant
for this to happen.. Especially not to you.."" God damnit. Why does this motherfucker have a mystical way of breaking my heart? ""It's
okay Chask. We'll figure this out.""

After we both took an extra large shot each, we sat down and began to discuss our options. Many hours and cigarettes later, we
came to the conclusion that we really only had 3 halfway viable options; #1: Beg our parents. That seemed very unappealing,
and highly unlikely to work- they were almost as broke as we were. #2: Leave the state. But we (obviously) had no money, which 
would make survival rather uncomfortable. Plus, we didn't know how connected these guys were, what if they just caught up 
to us wherever we ran to? #3: Nothing, and pray to Junkie Jesus that they were either bluffing, and if they weren't, that they 
wouldn't hurt our families.

Dejected and miserable, we parted ways, deciding that maybe an actual good night's rest would help clear our heads. Maybe
a little less dope too. But the clock was ticking, and time was not on our side. We had to make a decision. Soon. When I
got home to my quaint two bed room house, I was suddenly hit by a strong wave of nostalgia. I thought back to all of the
crazy shit me and Chask had been through together over the past 8 years, and it made me feel a little better. We had
gotten through everything else life had thrown at us. Together. Why should that change now?

After I got inside and changed into my house clothes, I decided to roll a joint. I had bought an ounce several months back
after.. happening.. into a somewhat large sum of money, and because I hardly ever smoked anymore, I still had most of it.
After I had finished the joint and was smoking my last cigarette before bed, my phone lit up on the coffee table in front
of me. It was Jake. Jake was a somewhat newer friend. I met him about 6 months ago at a party through a mutual friend (that
friend happened to be the possibly HIV infected girl I slept with and whose jacket I stole). 

""Hello?"" ""Hey Dewey! What's up man?"" ""Not a lot, just smoked weed for once, I'm high as tiiits!"" (which was true, I hadn't
been that stoned since I was in high school). ""Damn man, you sound like you aren't lying! Anyway, you still fuck with 
the boy?"" ""Of course I do, I'm a heroin addict!"" (Oh right, that's why I don't smoke anymore.) ""Hahaha, true, true. Anyway,
I have a little proposition for you."" ""Oh?"" Jake was known for his large amounts of money, and flashing it willy nilly to
impress girls because that was the only way he could get them to sleep with him.

""Yeah. I think you could profit quite nicely from this little venture, and I need someone I can trust."" ""You have my attention.""
""I have a few friends up in [Two States to the North] who need a pack. A big one. I need you to pick it up from my man, and deliver it 
to them."" ""How big are you talking?"" ""Pretty big, man. I'm not exactly sure on all the figures just yet, but it will be about 15 grand."" 
Holy shit. Were mine and Chask's prayers being answered in the form of a trust fund wigger who happened to have a reliable 
heroin connection? 

""Whoooo"", I whistled, ""That's a lot of cash brother."" ""Yeah, it is. But I trust you, you've always been a
straight shooter with me, no bullshit, and I respect that. Plus you have a good reputation amongst the local junkies, so I figured 
I would call you before anyone else."" For a rich kid who grew up in a damn near mansion, he really was a man of principle.

""Shit man, I'll have to think about it. When would this be happening?"" ""Better think quick, you would be leaving in 36 hours."" 
That would be 10 am Thursday morning. ""You remember Chask, right?"" ""Yeah, of course, you guys are always together."" ""I would
have to bring him with me. No ifs, ands, or buts."" ""That's cool man, however you feel comfortable. If you trust him, so do I.""
This was beginning to look like my parents might not be attending a funeral so soon after all. 

""Well, how much would I be making on this deal?"" ""I would be giving you 15% of what I make, plus they said they would pay you
handsomely just for running it to them."" ""How much do you think you'll be making?"" ""Like I said, I don't know all the
figures just yet, but I'd say at least doubling my money, lowballing it."" The gears in my head were turning at 100mph. 

""I'll have to talk to Chask about all this. It's a lot of risk, man."" ""I know it is, but the bigger the risk, the better the 
reward."" ""Hmph. Very true. I'll call you with an answer within 24 hours."" ""Make sure you do, because I do have someone else 
who will do it, but I would rather help you than them, and I trust you more."" ""You can count on it."" ""All right man, let me 
know. Later."" ""Later brother. And thank you for thinking of me."" ""No problem bud. Talk to you soon."" 

Chask wasn't going to believe his ears when he got a load of this shit. This was big. A hell of a lot more money
than we had ever even seen at one time, let alone dealt with. I immediately called Chask and told him about the 
conversation. 

""What's up Dewey? I figured you'd be in bed by now."" ""I thought I would be too, but Jake just called me."" 
""Jake? What does richboy want?"" ""He gave me a proposition, and, well, we might have to bend our morals a little bit,
but if we do, we can pay [Redacted], and hopefully not get killed."" ""Come over tomorrow, we'll talk this through.""
""All right, I'll just come over around 11."" ""Okay, I'll see you then."" 

I arrived at Chask's house at 11:02 the next morning, and he was waiting for me on his porch smoking once again.
He only did that when he was either really excited, or really, really nervous. ""Hey Dewey, come on in, let's
get high before we talk, I'm sweating already, but I decided to wait for you."" Chask loved getting high with me.
Don't get me wrong, he would shoot up alone under a bridge with a needle he'd used 100 times, but he preferred
to be with me. And honestly, me him.

After our shots and we got comfortable, I began to gather my thoughts, deciding how to explain what needed to be done.
Chask may have robbed [Redacted] via a cock bite, but typically that goes way against his morals. That's part of 
the reason we got along so well, we were both as honest as two junkies could be. 

""Okay Chask, you may not like 
this, but I think we can both agree that neither of us would like to die, right?"" ""Right.. I already don't like this, man.""
""I don't either, but surviving is pretty nice. Lisa wouldn't like you much if you were a corpse, would she?""
""Really, using Lisa as leverage? That's dirty man."" ""You know I'm kidding. But seriously, this could really help
us. It may not get us completely out of the shit, but it'll take us out of the fire and put us in the frying pan.""
I ashed my cigarette on his table, returning the favor he's done for me so many times.

""All right. I'm listening man."" ""Okay. Jake called me last night right before I went to bed, and gave me a 
proposition. He wants us to run about 15 grand worth of dope up to his boys in [State to the North].""
""15 fucking grand?!"" ""Yeah. 15 fucking grand."" ""Do you know what would happen to us if we got caught with
that shit? On the INTERSTATE? I don't want that kind of charge man!"" ""I don't either, but listen to me, we
don't have to run it. He wants us to meet up with his guy, pick it up, and then run it. He would be giving
us the cash up front."" ""So, you're suggesting we rob Jake for 15 thousand fucking dollars?"" ""Well.. Yeah, man.""
Chask's face was a mixture of internal conflict and mild determination.

""Let's do it."" ""Really? I thought it would take a little bit more to convince you."" ""Look man, I'm a LOT more
afraid of [Redacted] and his crew than I am some rich kid who's car is worth more than my house. We might be
robbing Peter to pay Paul, but Peter is a fucking pussy, and Paul is a killer. And so are his friends.""
""My thoughts exactly. We may still be in a situation with Jake, but that won't be as hard to deal with as
this. Plus, we have a deadline to meet, and I don't want to think about what will happen if they have to
come looking for us."" Chask was slightly nodding his head, his brow furrowed. 

""When will this go down?"" ""We 'leave' in 24 hours, approximately. I have to give Jake an answer within the next 12.""
""Might as well go ahead and tell him it's a go."" ""Are you POSITIVE you're in this with me Chask?"" ""Have I ever 
bailed on you before?"" ""No, you haven't. And I don't think you ever will buddy. And neither will I."" I gave him 
a small smile, showing my appreciation and love for him. He was with me even in the darkest of times. I couldn't say 
that about anyone else.

""Well, I guess I'll give him a call."" Chask nodded solemnly. ""Let's save our asses bud."" I couldn't believe 
what was happening. The timing, the amount of money, who it was that called.. It seemed like everything had 
lined up perfectly. I was almost in a state of euphoria, the relief being so great. 

But in the back of my head there was a tiny, quiet voice. So quiet it was almost drowned out by anticipation, 
fear, excitement, and relief. But that quiet little voice was screaming as loud as it could, and it was 
telling me that this was lucky. REALLY lucky.

And far, far too good to be true.

I have strange 1 cm in diameter burn-like spot on my leg with a small 0,5 cm diameter black spot in middle of that bigger spot (there are really small blistering area, but no big blisters as IMHO should be from a cigarette). 
Today I nodded out with a cigarette, but I never felt the pain or anything - just now, 8h after nodding situation I noticed that black spot while in shower. 

Anyone has an idea what could it be? If not a burn, maybe a bacterial infection? But probably not because they couldn't appear and make a burn like sore so fast (in couple of hours basically) 

Can a nodding person burn himself with a cigarette so bad that the skin gets 4th degree burns, turns black and basically necrosis kicks in? Because that's what I'm paranoid about. 

Thank you for your input. It will be much appreciated. I want to calm down and stop googling about possible lethality of this small burn like thingy. 

TL;DR questions: How do you think, will nothing bad happen if I get a sleep now and then go to doc? (as I don't feel any pain (maybe a small tingling), though on my 30ml methadone maintenance dose). And second - can cigarette burn be so severe or will the blacked/dark skin just fall off while the leg will heal? And can it be so severe that you have to go to a doc ASAP? (but it doesn't hurt, nor there are any other ""bad"" feelings)

Help me please get my after 30+ awake hour sleep guys and calm me by trying to answer to my TL;DR questions. I'm fucking scared that I will die in sleep. 


P.S.

I don't have any possibility to see a doctor in the next 12 hours and I'm so tired but in panic and want to sleep, so please help me understand what it is so I can atleast have few hours of sleep before going to doctor and checking it out (I have a cheap cell phone as my smarthpone died, but maybe later can take a picture and upload it here). 

So please at least tell me that I wont die because I couldn't get to the doctor in next 12 hours (or my leg will not get cut of). I've no idea how bad is potentially dead (brown-blackish dot w/o any feeling in it, though the rest of the ""burn"" has sensation). 

P.P.S.
The most interesting thing - this doesn't hurt at all. It feels a bit sore after I noticed it and after the shower (there's some slimy-watery action going on in the ""burn site""). And I don't remeber feeling any pain after nodding today. So you see - I calm myself by knowing what could it be. ",1468137227.0

Long story short, we get the half today, I load up a decent sized piece to share and we smoke. I start nodding hard, feeling real fucked up. But like 10 minutes later, all the feeling is totally gone. I barely feel anything at all. Like practically sober. I've never experienced anything like this, and the black looked normal to me just like everything else I've copped. Is there another way to tell if this is really cut with fent?

How many days should I give my receptors to recover from using?,"I have recently discovered H (sniffing) and it's a really nice drug, basically it's everything I've ever wanted out of an opiate: decent cost/potency ratio, good legs, great high. I usually just go for getting a buzz on, I usually don't go for nodding off or getting super duper high. So far I've been doing it about once every 4 days, but these last few days have been use, skip, use, skip which has got me curious about stuff. I should note I also use kratom on occasion, but rarely--usually just to ease the nasty comedown rage on some opium I have, altho I've stopped using the opium altogether since H doesn't give me a comedown at all, besides some mild cravings which are no big deal.

I want to (obviously) avoid becoming addicted, and I also want to avoid spiking my tolerance by stuffing those receptors all the time and having my brain make a ton more of them...although maybe that's somewhat inevitable, I generally have low thresholds for most drugs to begin with. 

Anyway, enough background info: how many days do y'all recommend I give my receptors to recover? In your mind(s), what's the maximum safe usage frequency?

Thanks in advance, peace

EDIT: I should also note that I'm not one of those people that gets addicted to things easily. I have smoked cigarettes for a few months and just got sick of them and stopped, several times with years between. I used to do a fair amount of opium tea (once per week) and never got addicted, when the pods got banned from eBay I was just kinda like ""meh, oh well"". I'm 'blessed' as far as that goes. so I understand that the answer to this question psychologically varies from person-to-person, but I guess I'm asking from the physiological point of view of the brain's receptors.

EDIT 2: thanks again for talkin, y'all. I had definitely vastly underestimated the importance of psychological addiction, and I see that now. I will definitely tread very very lightly in the future and be far more wary of psychological addiction before I really worry about physical addiction.",1468103738.0

It is more abundant and cheaper than ever and you have the poor and rich alike hooked on it. Sure, it'd been like that forever, except now numbers are growing exponentially into an epidemic.  But why?


The answer is quite simple:

1) Legitimate pain patients (with proof of injury) being cut-off ""just because the docs don't want to get in trouble by making DEA think they are prescribing too many narcotics.""
2) Legitimate pain patients again with serious injuries being under-medicated by their doctors. You have Stage 4 cancer or MS? Here's some tramadol.  
2) Legitimate pain patients again unable to fill their prescriptions because pharmacies have ""reached their quotas"" and can no longer dispense to anyone. This is a new(er) law enforced by the DEA/FDA, where pharmacies (see the whole states) being restricted on what they receive -regardless of % of population needing pain relief. 
3) Poor economy contributing to despair. 
4) Drug addicts, but that's old knows. 

So the top 3 reasons are legitimate pain management patients just trying to lead normal lives, being deprived of their medicine (I'm only referring to non-abusers).

So a certain % gets desperate unfortunately and turn to heroin. This also leads to more arrests = $$$$

Say you want to buy heroin, ok well then we are going to put you in this registry and any time your name is ran by law-enforcement or doctors they can see your purchase history. You're only allowed to purchase enough for yourself to attempt to avoid diversion. There could be a way to test how much of the drug is CURRENTLY in your system by the amount of mcg present in your bloodstream. If you have any present in your bloodstream while driving, then it's a DUI. If you're a chronic pain patient, you're allowed to have a certain amount of your therapeutic opioid/opiate in your system while driving which corresponds to your prescribed dose and tolerance...

My parents raised me right and always provided me with what I needed. When I turned 13, I started being reckless and curious. I started smoking weed and then that escalated quickly because whenever anybody offered me something I would take it. Regardless of what it was. I moved up the line, weed, hallucinogens, coke. By the time I was 14 I was doing meth with my best friend who was only a few years older. I was riding the city bus home one day and when I get off, an older man got off at the same stop and since we were walking so close together it was almost weird not to have a conversation. So we started talking and it turned out he lived just a few blocks down from my house. He invited me to come smoke a bowl at his house. Me being naive and stupid said yes. We went back to the house and sat in his garage and got super baked. He invited me to come over the next day and hang out.  Once again. Naive and stupid. I said yes. He had told me to just walk right in at 12pm and go down to the basement where he was staying. So the next day I walked in. Went down to the basement, to find him with a needle in his arm. I was kind of upset as I had told him the day before that I wanted to stop getting high. But as soon as I saw it I knew I had to try it. He offered. Of course. And sat me on the bed and shot me up for my very first time. This man turned out to be 36 years old and went by the street name ""ace"". He got me high and it was a euphoria. I will never forget lying back on the bed and just feeling a feeling that was unreal. He turned me around and asked me to take my top off. I did without even asking because I didn't really care he laid me face down and started to give me a massage. I'm not gonna give too much detail, but that lead to me laying there while this 36 year old had sex with me. When it was done and over with, he sat me up and gave me more H. I couldn't believe the way this drug made me feel. Then I started to get really itchy, really hot, and reallyyyy fucking thirsty. He said that that was normal and brought me upstairs. I spent so much time with this man after and we ended up ""dating"" at least that's what I thought it was at the time. But now I look back and see that it was a much older man taking advantage of a 14 year old girl. I was with him everyday. He got me high for free multiple times everyday and got me hooked. He used to get me smashed out of my mind and take pictures of me after I nodded off. Naked photos. He kept them in a safe in his basement along with a pistol, money and his stash. He would convince me to go out while I was high even though I would tell him I could barely walk. I remember one time, we were walking to the gas station and I started throwing up and collapsed on the ground. He left me there and his buddy had to bring me back to the house. Anyways, this lead to a very unhealthy relationship which consisted of me being dependent on him to keep me high, and he knew it. He liked to mess with me and make me dope sick by not getting me high for days. He wouldn't let me get high with anyone else because he ""didn't want me to get hurt"". But really he just like the control over me. The relationship escalated to the point of me being unable to stand sitting on his basement nodding off and him sticking a pistol in my mouth. The same guy who brought me back from the gas station made him take it out and I believe to this day that that man is the reason that I'm alive today. Ace went to jail on his birthday. I went to rehab and got clean. I got out and started going to AA and NA meetings. That worked really well for me and I stayed clean for a year. After my new boyfriend and I had broke up, due to me relapsing in his apartment. I continued going to meetings and got clean. Shortly after returning to meetings. The men in the rooms had seen that i was single and vulnerable. I ended up being 13th stepped by multiple different men. And will not return to another meeting. Today I have almost a year and a half clean and sober off of everything. Haven't seen Ace for years and am very content with my sobriety. It wasn't easy getting clean after ace, but meeting the phenomenal boyfriend that I had met took very good care of me and we got clean and sober together. I didn't think I would be able to stay clean as long as I have amidst all the chaos of losing a man that I was and still am in love with. But I have and for that I am grateful.

I was on the suboxone strips for about 8 months, and have been on the subutex pills for 6 months. I'm currently on 4mg a day. 

   I know how to taper correctly, but because I'm getting the subutex pills it's harder to dose below 4mg accurately because they crumble. It's not like the strips where you can cut them. They look like this... https://www.drugs.com/imprints/logo-actavis-153-22875.html

   So with that said, has anyone ever successfully done a taper off of the pills? Is there a way to correctly do this? Maybe dissolve them in something so I can volumetric dose? If so what do I dissolve them in?

   ANOTHER question.. I feel ""normal"" now because I've been on subs for so long, so I'm wondering how does ""normal"" feel off of subs and completely sober? More energy? More emotion? Anyone care to chime in and give me there opinion?

I keep my usage secret as best as I can for various reasons. One I am supposed to have been clean for the last 2 and a half years. I recently relapsed in February on Heroin. Up to that point I had only ever done pills. But it is cheaper than pills and more abundant now (I haven't come across any Dilaudid in the last 6 months, I have seen roxy's twice. Otherwise it is all heroin now).

Up until around a month ago, I had only one connect. It was a bitch to deal with him, but I didn't want that many people knowing that I was using, so one person was good. But finally I got tired of dealing with his antics, so I got his dudes number and dealt with him direct... But after a while that connect was getting on my nerves because he would only deal with me if I went to him, which is like 9 miles away and I am not mobile besides walking. 

So I got two new connects that I have known for a long while and are cool with driving to me. So at max, 6 people who use know that I use heroin.

Besides that, no one know that I use heroin except for one person. If anyone else knew, they would call me into the authorities (PO) or I would be homeless.

You hate yourself every second of every day. You obsess over your past decisions and where it all went wrong. It hurts too much to keep thinking about. You're dead broke. You have no money for food or clothes. You've been fired from every job you've ever had. You will never have a career. You bled your families finances dry. They were so loving and caring but fuck 'em. You give a shit, but not really. If your grandparents were still alive, you'd fuck them over too. You lost everything and everyone in your life. You will never experience any kind of friendship ever again. 

You look and feel like absolute shit. You don't even recognize yourself in the mirror-that is if you can even bare to look. You have scars, and track marks all over. You fucking smell. Showering is no longer a priority. Neither is brushing your disgusting teeth, or changing your filthy clothes. You have no sex drive. Rest in peace to that. You have no desire for anything. You feel sad, lonely, nervous, sick. That growing pit in your stomach. You feel enormous guilt 25 hours a day. Yup. It's fucking unbearable. You can't escape your thoughts. You can't enjoy anything that you use to love- hiking, playing the guitar, painting, and fishing. You haven't done any of those in over 10 years. You've became so awkward. You can't socialize. You caused irrevocable brain damage because you stutter now and can't finish sentences. You're too embarrassed to look at anyone in the eye. You get so violently ill on the regular. It feels like the flu- just a hundred times worse ...and this happens more times in 3 months than any person should feel in a lifetime.

You destroy your body daily with no regard. You can't believe that your body keeps taking the abuse. Your veins, your nervous system, your brain and all your organs. Your poor little heart and kidneys. Fuck- your body is helpless to the assault you are putting on it. It's begging and pleading for you to stop. Hanging on by a thread-fighting, battling. Like a little puppy being attacked by a pitbull. Its still breathing but barely. If the attack stops now, it could be saved. Please keep fighting puppy.

You risk felonies and deal with disgusting people all the time- people just like you. Let's be honest-you're way worse. Your loving mother has cancer and there's no chance you will even call. You have Hep C- you think you might have HIV too but you haven't gotten tested in forever. You've been to jail and you've slept on the pissy floor of a prison cell. Sadly, you enjoy jail more than your regular situation. Everywhere you go, people stare at you, point at you and feel bad for you. Some laugh at you- stories are being told about you.... 

Taking a piss or a good shit has become a god damn chore. You can't sleep. Food will never taste the same again. You haven't eaten in 2 whole days. You will never truly enjoy anything ever again. You have no pleasure left in your brain. ""For real though- When did I start fucking stuttering?!?! I can't make any sense. When the fuck did this happen""?

You didn't sign up for this. You hate this so much. Theres an outside chance you will die today- an even better chance you will die in the next 2 years. You're a wreck- Always waiting with anxiety, your legs are shaking, your body hurts. Diarrhea, puking, headaches, shaking. You'd rather be hit by a bus.

 Greasy god damn hair, and dirty fingernails.  Bags under your eyes... 
Dirty restrooms and filthy fucking toilets. This is sooo bad. Where did it get this fucking bad!? 

You've become ""that guy"". You are a fiend, a junkie, a skell. A slave, a puppet for something you hate(love) so much. You're a total piece of shit fuck-up. You yell and scream and carry on. You've lost it- well past gone. Your memory is done, your brain is fried. You're a walking zombie. This is hell on earth. You are nothing- you will never be anything.

My first contact with an opiate was when I broke my arm when I was 8 and I remember feeling like I HAD to experience it again, I just kept pushing the refill button I was given.

Fast forward 3 years and I experienced my first ""real"" depression, suicidal ideation and all that. At age 12 I raided my parents medicine cabinet for opiates (researched online) to escape from this feeling. It took a long time before I fogured out that it was not normal to feel this way. My friends started smoking weed when they were about 13 and by then I had already tried codeine, nitrazepam and some other opioid that got discontinued. When I was 14 I was busted by my parents with weed and clonazepam, I tried for the first time explain that I really did not feel well but my father said that if you feel bad you don't turn to drugs (???). This made me clam up and I never told anyone how bad I felt until I told my GF at age 17. During all this time I used about every drug I could get a hold of, with an emphasis on lsd/shrooms and most of all subutex.

When I moved out (age 18) I used heroin for the first time. Started by snorting but soon moved to injecting. At age 19 I was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 1 which explained how I felt all those years and when I finally got help I quit heroin (was a bitch) only using subutex occassionally and LSD when I felt I needed to see things from a different perspective.

However the urge for heroin got stronger and stronger and two weeks ago I shot up once again, I used 3g over a week and am going to re up again this week.

What I am wondering is there any success stories where people can keep using it in intervals and avoid addiction?

I figured I'd do a quick search through the sub because I'm pretty sure someone said to try it before. Mixed responses, the general consensus was that yes, it would help to feel better. 

Before heading out the door at 7 am, I did a line of maybe 20-30 mg? Just leftovers from the weekend, no tolerance I would imagine. And it was cool for a bit, my mood was elevated at least. But my stomach was still killing me and I was sweating profusely. I had to go to the bathroom and wipe off at least three times in the first two hours. I did notice I was mentally alert, which is good. But I started to crash by 11 am. I have no idea how. I thought I'd be good for the work day at least. And then in the afternoon I just felt awful. 

Not sure if my experience was from the high wearing off because I didn't take enough, maybe should've done it orally, or if meth and withdrawals don't mix. I just wanted to post this so that other ppl searching this could understand that shit could go wrong. At home, sure. But maybe not at work unless you can redose at noon. You will sweat though lol.

So I have been friends with this dude, lets call him Joe. We have been friends for at least a decade. Prolly 15 years. Long before opiates entered the picture. The type of dude that that you put friendship first. You know, the kinda guy you would split your last point with if he was sick. 

So anyways I have been using his plug for a while now. Where we live (or at least in my circle of junkie friends) you don't share plugs. Like if person A has to use persons B plug then they get broke off. So for the last year and a half I pick up with my friend Joe and break him off. thats how he stays well. as he doesnt have a job or anything. I always assumed he was high buckin me a little and and also having me break him off. But I was fine with that. I was fine with it because he was my boy and I knew that if had the means he would do the same for me. Joe has even owed me a few hundred for few months now. (I know I'll never see the money) but that's neither here nor there.

So anyways, The last few times we have gone to pick up Shit has been a little off. Usually D-boy pulls up next to us and Joe jumps out, running up to the car and runs back where I am parked directly behind them. Like a couple days ago he had to walk all over to go meet his plug, instead of the usual then he jumped out of my car and ran across a busy street to meet him. Then I he was sending me all over to pick him up. He should have been super easy to find but for some reason I couldnt find him for a couple minutes. I get the bag and he said he didn't know why but the dope and the xanax were all in the same bag. When I got home I noticed my shit was super light.

Then this morning I wanted a gram and a half. Well, I get to Joe's house, and he says dude had to be somewhere so he just dropped it off. Instead of 3 half gram bags it was just all in one bag again. I didnt think much of it. then I got home and threw it on a scale and it was pretty light. So because of that I had to re-up later in the day. I said I needed another G and a half. Joe says head on over his way. I said ok, I also asked Joe to tell his guy to double check the weight this time. Joe says ""OK, But don't go to his house."" (this whole don't go to my house thing started a few days ago.) Then he gets in my car and says he says. Dude only had a gram and a 20 bag. I said fine. He hands me the bag and Joe said his guy tossed him some so I dont need to break him off. I said OK and took off. 

When I got home I opened my shit and inside was this little bag but the color was a little different. I was just going to mix it with a shot. Well I forgot to add it and set it aside. Later I decided I would cook up that 20 bag. First I put it on the scale. It weighed 1/4 of a point (That's equal to 800/gram for all you scholars). I was understandably bummed but w/e. then I tossed it in my spoon and went to mix it up. It felt like sand in my spoon. Why? BECAUSE IT WAS FUCKING SAND!

My friend of 15 years who I always considered to be pretty honest. and whose habit I pay for, was going to let me inject sand into my arm. So he could scam me out of some dope. 

I left out a couple other things he did to me in the last few days but basically the same shit. 

I'm so bummed. I guess in this game nothing comes before your dope. It's just I have been so good to the guy. And this is how he repays me. by straight stealing and bold face lying to me. To the point where he actually has fake phone conversations in front of me. 

Well today I'm going to show up at the dealers house and ask him about everything. then when he says no he didn't sell me a bag of sand. And I confirm everything with him I'm going to go confront my friend. Let him know how horrible he is. ask him how he could be so malicious to someone who has done nothing but help him.",1468320386.0

I don't want to get my doctor suspicious of me though because I really do need the pills and he's only been my doctor for 2 months.  He's been great to me and I don't want to screw that up.

As if by some kind of soul connection, the afternoon after it happened I was randomly struck by severe sadness and was crying uncontrollably and wanting for my friends to be safe and heathy, and a short time later I got the call giving me the news.  Even though he had fallen into the deepest of rabbit holes, becoming addicted to heroin, meth, and xanax simultaneously, it still shocked me.  Even though I knew there was an extreme danger of death every time he used, every day, I still couldn't prepare myself for it. He was over the top outrageous on the outside, but a soft romantic on the inside who wanted his beloved cat to be the ring bearer in his dream wedding.  As someone who struggles with social anxiety, he was the first person I went to at parties/events. His offensive and vulgar jokes filled the awkward silences I feared and made me laugh and forget what I was so nervous about.  But in the end, whatever mental hell he was in became too much to handle, and he ended it all.  I can't stand the thought of him dying alone thinking it was the only way he could get out of that hole.  The regret of not being able to show him this in time is overwhelming. How can I continue going on living normal life, doing normal things, like everything is the same? I feel as though it would be like forgetting him, like pretending it didn't happen, like disrespecting his memory. I miss him dearly, I miss the person he was before all the heavy shit went down. And I still can't believe I will never laugh with him again in this lifetime. Until I see you on the other side, keep the jokes coming my friend. <3",1468264647.0

I'm at the poi r where I'm you g to have to sacrifice things I truly love of I want to keep going, and the fleeting high no longer feels worth the cost.

I'm looking for a little advice on tapering/jumping off. I was using about 2-3 points a day for the last couple weeks. I did about a half a point this morning, and still feel ok 7 hours later. I'm low on funds, but currently have half a point, 1 8mg strip, and a half a bar (more Xanax should be available).

My plan was to kick next week while working from home, but I'm wondering if it's possible to do so faster so as to conserve money.

My worst withdrawal symptom is the stomach cramps and vomiting, the others haven't been too bad in the past. 

My question is, is there a way to wean down from where I'm at so that I'm well enough to work, or should I just wait and jump cold turkey over the weekend/next week. I just want this shot behind me so I can go back to my old life.",1468262105.0

My dboy and I have a good relationship, if he accidentally shorts me he'll get me back, I've given him money (small amounts ~$60) and he's brought me a b back. So I have access to Xanax for cheap. He asked me to set him up with 100. I did. He grabbed the bag, told me his wallet was in his car and I didn't think anything of it cause I've always trusted this guy. But the car speeds away and he ignored my calls until finally it said the number is out of service. So moral of the story is I got beat for $300 by a person I thought was a friend. And to top it off I'm sick and was gonna use the money to buy some oxy to ease my suffering. So that's my shitty week. Wish that lesson wasn't so expensive.

Was chillin with some friends one night recently; they actually are a bit closer in proximity to ""the scene"" out here as per one of their siblings, so they are exposed to more users/situations on a daily basis than I am 

We were talking about how drastically the game has changed (we are all mid-late 20s so feel like ""old people"" compared to a lot of the kids we know) and when the topic of ODs came up, it's like the conversation never ended! I've not yet OD'd (knocking on wood) as I try to stay responsible w use and ensure that I'm not IV'ing or trying to go too crazy on it

Anyway, it made me think of a text I'd gotten from one connect that said he had narcan for sale, something like ""you can get it from me for just $60 instead of the $140 at ____ (CVS across the state line, I think)

So apparently if we want to stay safe then it's a minimum of $60 for just one dose of narcan, or even double+ that if obtained legally OTC in the nearest state. No one I know would be willing to spend that on anything but dope. And having seen a friend go blue *immediately* after only pushing in like 1/3 of the plunger, and falling down backwards after finishing it, I'm starting to feel unsafe/nerve-wracked with anyone using more than like 0.1 at a time, maximum

I would love to be able to say I have the capital to go to the neighbor state and buy enough narcan OTC to give plenty of supplies to my friends, but that could easily run into the thousands and rn I'm not making enough money for this to be possible (not to mention that for the entire summer I have absolutely no reason to go the direction of that other state; in fact, I am working out of town and to get there I drive in the exact opposite direction for a couple hours)

So, if anyone has any ideas on how to help me and my group of friends a bit safer than we currently are lemme know!

  i discovered opiates in early 20s and wow, i saw life thru a new filter, i enjoyed life like never before..i seemed to be rewarded more by  work, friends, games etc etc..years down the road i had to quit and the resulting withdrawals were god awful..the anhedonia was worse than ever, i was lethargic beyond belief, mood was in the gutter..

 i was clean from methadone for 16 months, never even took caffeine in this time but basically i felt like shit tbh..i worked out hard evry day, ate right, had a good job but i just felt off..i rarely enjoyed anything..

  i discoverd kratom about a year ago and l and behold, it worked great..i was motivated for the time  in years, i felt enthusiastic, people werent a chore to talk to, i had more energy..yet 8-9 months after starting i ramped my use up and those great effects lessened big time and were replaced with apathy, a crshed sex drive and im more of a recluse now than i have been in years..im tpering now but already feel the anhedonia and lethargy creeping in..sure i can get clean but if i suffer from anhedonia and chronic low mood then whats the point?

  ive tried welbutrin, selegiline, amisulprid, zoloft, paxil but very disappointing results..some made me feel worse and even more apathetic!

  so anyone else in my situation in regards to anhedonia?have u tried anything that actually helped?should i maybe consider going on low dose subuxone maintenance just so i can function like a normal human being?

I wanted to ask about fentanyl. I had a really dickish dboy a about 5 years ago. He would get jealous if he found out I'd go to other dealers after I had to wait like 8 hours. He was really rude and condescending to all his customers.There were always complications with him and I know for a fact that he robbed one of my neighbors at gunpoint when he got up a few hundred dollars to score. The gun actually went off in his truck and grazed the guys head. 

So me, being the idiot I am, kept scoring off the guy after that. In the area I lived in at the time, we only had BTH. It was incredibly rare to see powder.

One day dboy sells me something different he said he wanted me to test. It wasn't BTH, it was a very light colored powder. My girl and I did little a test shot and both immediately OD'd. We only had time to say, almost in unison something about ""damn, that's good shit.""

Woke up in the hospital. The neighbor and our roommate saved us with CPR until the Narcan could be administered, or whatever the hospital did. My GF and I both ripped out the IV's and walked out AMA.

Next day dboy called me and mentioned ""people have been telling me that shit I gave you last night is too strong. Should I cut it?""

So, he tried to murder us to sell more shit when the word got out, right? Was that fent?

I don't post often but I just got some Heroin #3 and it's my first time with it. I received it from Europe obviously and I'm not too familiar with how to work with it.

I know the safest acidifier is Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) and a second choice would be Citric Acid. But I have none of them at home right now.

Only ""pure"" acids I got is Vinegar (Acetic Acid 5%) or 17% Phosphoric Acid made to adjust the water PH to grow ""plants"" LOL

Would it be painful and or really bad to use one of those for 1 day, until I go and get some somewhere tomorrow? (Most likely would go with boiled Vinegar...seems to be the weaker of the 2)

*Anywho*.  They show the bunny-lady eating carrots ... and show Elephant-men and Elephant-women eating peanuts on what seems like it must be an ice-cream sunday.  Though perhaps it's really just a soy-based ice-cream simulation ... and doesn't involve milking cows.

What they don't explain though ... and what is *really* bothering me ... is what the predators eat.  Did they just evolve beyond having to eat?  Do they farm humans?  I guess they could eat bugs, since in this ""zoo-world"" bugs aren't on the same level as mice and rabbits and sloths and shit.

I guess there is one scene where the fox is eating a popsicle, though surely all the carnivores don't just live on popsicles.  

Maybe I'm over-analyzing things just a tad here... though It just seems like a major hole in the whole idea though.  The entire movie is dedicated to this concept of predators no longer murdering prey ... since they've evolved past that ... BUT WHAT DO THEY EAT!  They have to eat something right!

I have been an IV heroin user on and off for about 6 years -
This last year has been daily. I have had this sensation before, but NEVER felt or noticed the effects like this!

Lately, on occasion I have noticed that when I shoot, I can feel this prickly stinging sensation moving up my arm (or leg, or body, or what have you) - almost as though I can feel the dope moving through my veins, in a REALLY significant way.

Something important to note too, is that when this burning sensation happens, I also get red, upraised, hive-like marks all down my skin where burning occurs. It usually itches for a while, and then goes away. Again, just like the dope is moving through my veins and irritating the skin around it as it passes through.

This used to not scare me, but lately I have felt it moving through my FACE sometimes!! Almost as though a bunch of my veins have collapsed, and that is where the H is being routed through.

Tonight, I did a shot in my arm, and it was like BOOM I can feel it in my cheeks, behind my EYES, oh god it hurt so bad. It always passes though. After a minute or two I was fine, but my face still felt kinda funny after like a half an hour.

Went to check in the mirror, and...oh lord holy shitballs. I look like fuckin Lurch!!! Like full on The Thing status over here. My top lip is all swollen, my eyes are puffy as all get out, it looks like somebody pumped a shitload of air into my face and then stung it with a million angry bees. It is a frightening sight.

Do I have a bad batch or what?! Has anybody else had this sensation or experience before?? I'm especially interested in hearing from long term users, or users who have basically fucked their veins as much as I have. Because it truly feels like the shot is being ""routed"" through the veins in my face now, for whatever reason. Again, I have had this sensation a million times before after shooting, but it has NEVER been behind my face.

This is may be  the third time this has happened. I'm not sure if it's contained to this batch only though - I bought a few bags from multiple sources and have been using them pretty indiscriminately, so it's hard to tell which reaction was from which. The bag I used tonight though was pretty small to begin with, so I am inclined to say that this sensation is NOT limited to shots just from this bag. :(

Anyways, it's pretty freaky and my face feels (and looks) like it's turned into a bag of balloons. Any input or experiences with this would be SOOO appreciated!!

Love always,

Lurch

4ss449,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4ss449/life_is/,82,https://redd.it/4ss449,Derobyl,Life is...,"I'm so tired of constantly being broke. Never until this year have I experienced what it's like to truly struggle from paycheck to paycheck. And yet (almost) every week I figure out a way to set aside enough for a G of shit that's as close to pure as you can possibly get. Thanks for the tolerance, DNM... The first time I bought a G of essentially pure off the rock shit for a little under $200, it lasted me basically two weeks. ""Fuck, and I was paying like over $200 to get severely ripped off by a middle to get high for a night and a half??""

Yea, I forgot how quick tolerance builds. 

Yea, I wasn't shooting back then either.

Now, this last G lasted me maybe 4 or 5 days of being high. They aren't joking when they say that once you start dancing that dance, the needle is just as addictive as the dope you're pulling up through that ripped end of a Q-Tip. You never think that fluid inside your needle of choice would gradually fade from near clear to all but black. And I'm talking #4 ECP here... When I went to Wallmart that one fateful, awful, regrettable day and the assistant who could not give a fuck less about what I was clearly there for told me they only came in boxes of 100 I thought ""Jesus Christ, I just want a pack of ten to try it before I quit!""

Yea, I never expected to be running low on that box. Especially when I only use them once for a single shot. I don't ever reuse them. One shot each. And I'm running low. That was less than two months ago. 

I really thought when I lost all of my irl connects, that was the end. And for a while, it was. I thought I was doing well. I promise you, you will never battle anything else as much as quitting dope, or any other severe opiate addiction. I have yet to go through full blown withdrawl, but there have been more days than I would like to admit where I woke up with muscle aches in every place you can imagine plus a few that you couldn't. But it has yet to cause me to miss work. I have a self-destructive work ethic though, which is both a blessing and a curse. I digress, but the point I'm trying to make is I personally believe the mental battle of quitting is just as bad, if not worse, than the physical one. 

No one can ever prepare you for that first real rush you get from a successful shot. 

No one can ever prepare you for how quickly you transfer from almost never shooting it, to almost never sniffing it anymore because it does nothing for you.

No one can ever prepare you for how dark those shots can get, how much powder you can mix into the same amount of water. 

No one can ever prepare you for going from carefully weighing out how much you mix into each shot to looking at that mountain of powder in the spoon and thinking ""Well, if this kills me... Whatever...""

No one can ever prepare you for the first time you're having a conversation with someone and you notice their eyes glancing at your inner elbows. 

No one can ever prepare you for the first time you wake up GASPING for air and wondering what the fuck is going on while scrambling to hide the needle laying next to you and the dirty spoon and baggy on the coffee table in front of you, because you have no idea how long you've been out and no idea if anyone happened to see that scene.

I wish I could say that happened only one time. Everyone says that they'll never touch a needle. Yet you keep going back for more no matter how scary that first OD is. Just because you OD'd doesn't mean you demons did as well. You keep running but they run just as fast. In the back of your head you know you'll never outrun them by overdosing on your couch at 3am, but you keep fucking trying. It doesn't make any sense. Every time you get that fresh bag in your hand, you regret it so deeply.

""When will this end?""

""When will this *really* be the last time?""

""When will I finally progress in life and move on? When will I actually face my problems instead of emptying my bank account to unsuccessfully run away?""

But then you (finally) register. There is nothing better than seeing that mushroom cloud of blood appear in your needle, even when the shot becomes so dark it's hard to see. You know right then and there, as your jaw releases whatever you may be using to tie off, that you will be okay in about 20 seconds. That feeling of prophetic well-being overwhelms the ominous regret that occurs immediately before it before it so strongly. It was so easy to hit that same vein a week ago... now you spend so long trying to find the same one that your hand goes numb from being tied off so long. At first you think it would be IMPOSSIBLE to operate the needle with your non-dominant hand and start fresh on the opposite arm. You figured it out pretty fucking quick though, didn't you?

I want out so bad. Every time I mix up that last shot, I say this is it. The last one. For real this time. Regardless of how good it makes me feel, it has caused nothing but pain. 

Nothing but regret.

Nothing but more problems than I had before.

Nothing but heartbreak. 

Nothing but unnecessary struggle. 

But dealing with my problems is so much harder than running from them. At this point, I think the shots are getting darker and darker because I subconsciously don't want to wake up gasping anymore. I just want the pain to end. What in the FUCK will be the final straw???

Maybe when I finally accept what I refuse to realize: the things I already know... I was wrong with the aforementioned; quitting dope is not the hardest battle you will ever face. Fuck...

Life is.

Methodone: a drug not without it's own known specters. Some perspective would be welcome. Since it's a full agonist, does it help with the mental stuff? I would imagine it would. Because last nights codeine high wrapped it's long legs around my soul and held me and my demons safe and still.

The depression alleviation is amazing and makes me feel like *me* again. 

The shame is, nobody validates occasional (2-4x a week would be enough), light opiate use as a viable depression treatment.

It really bothers me that doctors will not prescribe opiates for depression treatment for the simple reason of most people can't be responsible with the opiate use, so therefore, although this is the only treatment that works FOR ME, I am not allowed to use it.

However, SCIENCE backs the claim that all of us know: the opioid system plays a critical role in depression modulation.

I am ecstatic to finally have an hour with a computer so i am able to start communicating with you folk, i really need it right now.
          a little bit of insight into me, I just moved into north central CO from the lowcountry and am totally alone out here. 1.5-2 year daily opiate user mostly ECP and oxy 30s. Currently two weeks sober with about one more to go before I get some k4s in the mail lol. If I was sane i would use this as an opportunity to get clean but i simply am not ready, every day is a test. I could score in town but am trying to exercise patience and taper down my habit.               
   I have maintained a $200 a day habit for this whole time insuffulating up until my last month where i made the transfer to IV. im sure there will be much retaliation to this point but the needle is what has made me begin to make changes for the better.putting shit into my nose or my lungs it is so easy to dismiss the damage i am doing, and my first use of a needle was on my journey here, in a gas station outside of Denver. 

It was the most spiritual high i have felt since my first dance with heroin, and it actually made me double take and say "" maybe wait 3 days before you do that again"". Since then I tapered down from 4-6 times daily to once every 3 days until i ran out of my supply, and now here i am patiently, but lustingly waiting. Im sure if i am not careful i will just spiral back out of control, but currently this is the most sober i have been and i feel the needle is to thank! thoughts?
        On to my next point i am a musician. Guitar and piano primarily with 2 years or less experience in producing and other instruments. I am curious if there are any other junkie musicians on this lovely forum? How do you feel your relationship with opiates has affected your music?

Worst experience: some asshole has me come out into the suburbs in a cab saying he'd pay for it... I get there and he's no where to be found, essentially fucks with me via text and gets off on wasting my time and putting me at risk of being arrested due to nonpayment of the cab fare.

However junkie Jesus was looking out for me because as it turned out the cab driver was a junkie/dealer too and took pity on me. After he filed the report so he didn't get fired he took me copping and gave me a bag, the cost of which he just added to the $80 fare I owed and subsequently paid him several days later.. 

After doing the bag I was dropped at the nearest L stop and my lady came and got me after I called her off a strangers phone.

Given my state of withdrawal, this is none too appealing to my weak stomach. I choke down a gag and survey my surroundings.

Directly across from the station, a group of homeless addicts (I call them shelter rats) sit like hawks, looking for any white face stepping off the train so they can attempt to lead you to the Honduran they're working for in hopes of getting a free balloon. Running customers will typically get you a free balloon for every $100 you bring to them, which may sound like a lot of work but is actually accomplished fairly easily, considering the amount of people milling about this part of town in search of drugs. I should know, I've ran customers on more than one occasion when I was broke and desperate. 

The group calls out to me. ""Ay huero, you looking??""

I ignore them and continue east of the train station. I've been down here enough to know who's got quality. Customer runners will tell you anything to get you to follow them to their guy. ""My guys got the best shit on the block right now!""

Obviously, very rarely is it true.

I make a diagonal Jay walk from the train station to the shelter, and can already see a group of Hondurans on the corner. They stick out like sore thumbs with their brand new Jordans, new era caps, and skin tight jeans. Swag fags. Not the type of garb you'd expect to see a transient wearing. It always perplexed me how they refuse to swallow their pride and dress down to blend in. They may as well be holding a sign that says 'I'm selling drugs, please arrest me.'

I reach the corner and am swarmed. It's a buyer's market, a very pleasing contrast to the dope scene where I come from in California. 

""Ay! Ay! Ay! Guero! Whatchoo want? Whatchoo want?!?!'

Amongst the chaos, I see the face of my regular Honduran and squeeze towards him.

""2 black, 1 white', I tell him as I hand over a f istful of crumpled bills as discreetly as possible. He does a quick side to side visual sweep of the street before spitting the product into his hand and handing it to me.

We hung out for a bit, then we had sex, and best thing of all - I had a girl to keep my arm around as I fell asleep. God I've missed that. God I miss my ex. Fuck.

So it was nice to have sex. Don't think it'll be any more than that with this girl though. Thing is, I met another girl on tinder the other day, super cute and we really hit it off. I really liked her and thought she liked me as well. But now she's just gone all radio silence on me and doesn't answer my messages. So being the emotional wreck that I am, it's like experiencing a breakup even though I've only met her once. I don't know man fuck. My emotions are really fucked up after having been sober for like a few months with a couple 3-5 day binges in between.

ANYWAY what my rambling ass is trying to get to is that, I got laid last night. To most guys (and girls I suppose) that would be enough endorphins to keep them going for a while. But as soon as I left I thought ""well, that was fun but I still won't have any dope for a few weeks"". And I was right back to square one. As depressed as always. I got an endorphin rush from having sex and really enjoyed not having to sleep by myself, but as soon as I left I was right back to where I was before she even messaged me. Depressed and craving heroin. Fuck man.

I don't know where I'm going with this, just looking to vent I suppose. I really like this community. Also, does anyone have any tips on how to deal with the overwhelming emotions that surface when being clean? I mean, it's like I fell in love with that girl that's stopped messaging me and I feel like such an idiot. I mean we've met ONCE and I just want to message her all the time, asking what's up, but I have to control myself because I know that'll just make her think I'm some sort of crazy creep.

Fuck it, back to my alcohol and emo music. Hopefully that'll tide me over til I can get dope again. All I want is to slam heroin. Don't even bother telling my I should stay clean cause it won't happen. Not for a while.",1468582813.0

I was wondering how hard it would be to just wean off heroin?

I don't mean to offend, I just genuinely know little about opies and I am more curious than anything?

I can understand quitting cold is hard as hell. But weaning seems straightforward? What is so hard about this? Could one not wean with a pharma opie that they could measure out and dose smaller and smaller amounts?

Or why not try and just sip on poppy pod tea every morning? 2-3 pods first thing after my morning dump kept me buzzing for about 24 ish hours. Thats about $6-10 a day for the rest of your life.

I have posted about it before, a couple weeks ago, seeking new hustles. I have been subsisting off of the kindness of my friends (one friend gave .4 for free last week) and selling some extra shit I had lying around. But needless to say, besides that .4 I had last Tuesday, the only other time I got high was on Saturday. I got hooked up with .2 of gunpowder for about $20 and a 5 year old Kindle Fire. 

On Tuesday I started a new job, in the midst of kicking a very mild habit. I am already a really anxious person, but the WD's madeit even worse. But I soldiered through that and my low self confidence and am actually doing really well at my job. I had been struggling with sleep (either I sleep too much or I sleep too little. I never sleep at night, only during the day) but when I started this new job I have been getting up every morning at around 7am, going to bed at 11 or 12 (my insomnia is still there, I still cannot fall asleep before ten, no matter how tired I am). Things actually look up for once. I used to be a really pessimistic person, but in recent years I have looked at things at a more positive note. I have lost my sense of entitlement and the chip that I had on my shoulder ( I was a very irritable person. The littlest things would set me off). But in 2014 I did a ton of acid and it really killed my ego and helped me through a lot of shit.

Anyways things are really looking up. I wish I got paid tomorrow, but I have to wait another week. Luckily I came across $30 today, was able to pick up a point (yeah I know, expensive, but in my area the standard price for a point is $30, some people if they are super greedy will charge $40 all day. Gotta love rural areas >:( ). So tomorrow I will have a rinse and about a quarter point to feel a little uplifted for work, maybe get me feeling a little more relaxed with potential clients. Next weekend is going to be CRAZY. $$$$ = Super loaded.

Was meeting my runner at our gas station and of course he has to lag this one day. After 20 minutes I see this odd Pontiac with tinted windows and a huge antenna that screamed Pig like their pink skin. I was sitting against the wall and it pulls up to the pump directly in front of me and just fucking sits there staring at me for like 5 minutes. 

After I calmed down and made a plan I learned real fast he was following me. I text my main dude to tell his runner to meet me at TGIF across the street because it was hot. I had my empty Arizona next to me and I acted like I was leaving but threw away the can first. The second I stood up and started walking, of course he decides to turn off his car and act like a normal dude. He followed me to the trash (right by the entrance to the store part) and I pretended to go back inside and buy another, daringly hold the door for 2 other ppl plus him. As he enters and says thank you, we stare each other down and I'm about to fucking lose it from paranoia. He obviously didn't want to use his $ to buy gas but had to and it was a great sight watching him reluctantly swipe a denied credit card then pay $13 in $1s and quarters like I did as a crack head. 

He goes out to pump it and eyes me down from outside and I decide to get the bathroom key which goes around the back. When he saw this his face was just like, ""fuck me"". I waited 10 minutes in there so he'd either be rushed to pump and leave (what I prayed for) or he'd waste his time and try to figure out a way that doesn't scream ""I'm pink and taste good with eggs or burgers"". Well as I leave I make a right turn (right turn only for driving) and he does too tailing me, however didn't expect me to hang a PHAT U turn the second he made the right into oncoming traffic, plus him realizing he has to go down at least a mile until he can turn around because center dividers and what not. 

Well that's mainly it cuz the Fridays was across the street and my boy met me right then. However on my walk to Walmart to get rigs I had to go through the same area and it was swarmed with cops but I didn't see him so everything was cool. Felt like such a boss after I realized I outsmarted someone trying so hard to blend in and does this as a living.

Particularly Jersey, Philly, and Baltimore, Maryland. It's not even close. Nowhere else in the country can dope be so easily copped off the street.

HOWEVER...

Follow me, if you will, on a trip down memory lane. Early to mid 90s, Westlake District, Los Angeles. Not to be confused with Westlake Village, an upper middle class paradise tucked away in the far west end of the San Fernando Valley, mere minutes away from Calabasas, which is an even more luxurious neighborhood, notable for being the home of the Kardashians.

No. In fact, the namesake is the ONLY thing these places have in common.

Westlake District, located in Central Los Angeles, immediately west of downtown, is an infamous slum, known for its numerous ruthless Hispanic street gangs, 18th Street and Mara Salvatrucha amongst them, and, at one point in time, it's open air drug markets that were so numerous and sprawling, they practically encompassed the entire district.

One spot in particular that stands out as quite possibly the most infamous open air market to ever exist on the West Coast, is a street named after a woman, intersected by a numbered street running East/West. 

This particular area is dominated by the Colombia Lil Cycos faction of the 18th Street gang,  and all throughout the 80s and 90s, was a thriving open air drug bazaar.

From lowly junkies of any race, to rock stars and A-List celebrities, this intersection was the go to spot for those looking to cop heroin, crack and practically anything nefarious substance you could think of. This intersection is discussed in detail in Anthony Kiedis' autobiography 'Scar Tissue', as well as numerous other celebrities memoirs.

As of today, this spot is no more. After decades of lawlessness, the Rampart Division has finally shut down this infamous spot.

Any LA heads have any crazy stories about this spot?",1468544891.0

I've always wanted to try a proper speedball, I usually didnt use enough H the times I've tried it. Or the coke was lousy. Well, a little searching and I finally found the grade A! It was a little moist, and when mixed with water for shooting, it left almost no residue, mixed up clear...

 Pulling a number out of my ass, I feel like its gotta be well over 75% pure, maybe even uncut. A tiny bit went a long way. The dope was decent too, and combined with the coke, there was no perceptable comedown from the coke. Sure I was ready to keep doing it until it was gone, but that soul crushing, fiending suicidal feeling you get with shooting coke wasnt there with the dope in the mix.

Also had a little weed and beer, and Sour Patch Redberry Slurpee kept me hydrated, haha. That shit is seriously good though. There is a picture of it haha, im not a pro with imgur so the pictures are out of order, but you got the coke by itself with its pearly shimmer, coke and dope together, and both in a spoon, that was one hell of a shot (more like two, one for me, one for my bro). Then there are pictures of the aftermath on my arm.

I went from being unemployable, in and out of jail, then overdosing in a WalMart parking lot with my 3 week old child in the backseat - to a paralegal at a law firm, joint custody of my daughter, doing music therapy with women in early recovery , and generally having this full life I could never have imagined.

I'm 45 days off Suboxone and I've managed to overcome some wicked cravings the last few days and this community really, *really* fucking helped. 

So basically I'm just super fucking emotional. All the time. I think I was like this before my addiction. If I like something, I become absolutely obsessed. I need to read about it for hours and talk about it with everyone in the world. If something is sad, I get really absorbed into it. Music makes me go insane with joy. But that's not really the problem. I'm actually relieved to be feeling these emotions. My problem is that it's negatively affecting my social life.

My friends are acting super fucking weird around me and I think it's because I'm so emotional. I can see them changing their behaviors as a direct result of the emotions I'm conveying and it gives me this huge sense of responsibility to constantly act detached. This stress is giving me the *biggest urge to use* since I stopped. I just want to hang out and be normal with my friends. If they didn't want to be around me anymore I would be wrecked.

So basically I'm not ready for Suboxone. They told me I could try methodone and switch back whenever I choose if I choose. They said I'm the boss.

So far so good. They gave me 30mg today aware that Suboxone would partially block it. I actually have a very slight nod. But.

I don't feel desperate to use. I feel okay - and not just physically like with the subs.

I know I may regret ever starting methodone but right now I need it so I don't go do something monumentally stupid. Thank you to those of you that gave your 2 cents. 

Wish me luck - I need it.",1468515895.0

So like many of you do, I middle man a decent amount. Nothing major(sadly) but not just like being a middle man for a half bun once a week, and have been doing it for like a year and a half now(with opiates, general middle-manning i've been doing for a few years) so I like to think i've gotten pretty decent at it. Before I talk about myself any more though, I wanna hear about y'all.

1. How long have you been a middle-man? Do you even consider yourself a ""middle-man""? Or do you just help out some friends once in a blue moon/here and there?

2. What are some of your kinda ""unwritten rules"" that you follow? IE one of mine is i'll never take more than whats decided on prior to the deal unless you're a *real* fucking prick or fuck me over in some way.

3. On a similar note, what are some rules that **all** middle-men(and women) should follow? General stuff or specifics. 

4. In regards to dealing with a middle-man, what should the person that wants the product both DO and NOT DO?

5. Feel free to come up with anything else you'd like to add. Tips, stuff you've learned because you've been doing it for a while not something you could read in a book or online, mistakes you've made that would help others out by telling them and explaining, etc etc you get the idea.

I gotta make a phonecall, i'l add the rest of my stuff in the comments(gotta get that comment karma! lmao sike)",1468514868.0
