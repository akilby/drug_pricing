1bi3m2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1bi3m2/a_pst_psa/,9,https://redd.it/1bi3m2,freakorgeek,A PST PSA.,"Greetings. As many of us are I'm sure, I've become very well acquainted with PST over the past 6 months or so. Recently I read someone's recipe which was a little different than mine and I tried changing mine up a bit the other day and experienced good results, so I thought I'd post my findings here.

Firstly, A lot of recipes recommend you soak the seeds for 20 mins or more. I found that shaking for about 30 seconds and letting sit for not more than 2 minutes afterward yielded more liquid that was just as potent as letting sit for 20 minutes. My guess is that the seeds start absorbing a lot of the liquid.

Secondly, I have a pretty weak stomach, I'm a picky eater by nature, and I have a very sensitive gag reflex. Over the months I've developed practices that help me down the rank liquid as quickly and painlessly as possible:

* Plug nose while chugging, keep nose plugged while you rinse with water and eat 2 minty tums afterwards. After letting go of your nose you shouldn't get any draft whatsoever of the smell/taste of the liquid

* Chug using a straw deep in the back of your throat so that the liquid avoids most of your tongue. I found at least for myself that sucking down the tea with a straw is by far the fastest way to get it all over with.

* Cooling the tea with ice or the refrigerator will help mask the taste even more.

* If chugging a large amount on an empty stomach, and if you use lemonade like I do, then antacids are a must, which is why I use mint flavored tums to get the taste out of my mouth.

Feel free to share your experiences or ask questions about PST. I'm just about to go pick up another few pounds myself...

SO, my question is - what is smokin the 30's doing to my lungs?  Im actually smokin one right now lurking r/opiates; and what brought me to post this; was when i took a hit, and inhaled the deep breath, following said breath - my chest made a long wheezing noise. So naturally, Im like wtf seeing as Im not currently sick; and at the moment even when I cough theres really no flem or congestion! Also, my boyfriend smokes roxies all the time; thats *all* he does drug-wise, he doesnt sniff or eat roxies ever. Just smokes them.  He also doesnt smoke cigarettes or weed. However, hes **always** hacking up some *other* shit; even though hes not sick. (black / brown goo). *shudder* I mention him because he doesnt smoke anything else; and otherwise his lungs should be fine.  I, on the other hand, smoke cigarettes and alot of blunts.  So its obviously doing something - but can anybody fill me in on details? Like what happens that makes my lungs shitty? lol Other than just the act of smoking PERIOD, what **inside** the oxy fucks my lungs up? *Why* does the oxy fuck my lungs up?

I did a CWE of some hydros but i just got sick and couldn't really appreciate it. So up until trying some dope I got off the SR, I was really trying to imagine what it felt like to be high off opi's, with no avail. I guess all other drugs were relatively easy to imagine the high based off erowid posts and such. Or extrapolate how other drugs might feel based on other similar drugs ( looking at you, psychadelics..), but what might a drug feel like that is designed to award the user pure concentrated happiness and blissful warmth. Well since trying trying heroin (insuffulated), here are my thoughts for the opi virgin lurkers or anyone else interested: pardon me if I sound like I'm stating the obvious since I know most of ya'll have much more experience with the stuff ;D. As I sit here nodding in my normally uncomfortable desk chair, I feel the utmost comfort; warmth radiating throughout my relaxed muscles that feel as though they are constantly being lightly stretched in an incredibly satisfying way, like spreading out on the ground after a long cool run; whole body being gently pushed backwards by some lovely, dull, buzzing force. Though my chair isn't anything special, I've the undeniable notion that right here is where I need to be, fading in and out of a twilight zone somewhere between sleep, daydreaming, and affectionate welcoming nothingness listening to Townes Van Zandt on spotify. By the way, spotify is the fucking shit! I was late to figure that one out.. Also, I highly recommend checking out Townes Van Zandt.

In my opinion, we ought to take in account what the user is looking for in terms of an ""experience"".

Do they view Heroin 

**a. as a recreational drug**? (""*every Friday*!"") 

*or -realistically-* 

b. **as a daily medicine for a sickness (the addiction) that is rarely standalone, but a symptom of an extra underlying psychological and/or physiological anomaly.**

-----------------------
**My answer:**

*I cannot speak for all, and will not generalize.*

I use Heroin and Flunitrazepam for G.A.D., panic attacks, O.C.D. (the real one-not the reddit one), PTSD, Migraines of the trigeminal nerve, and much, MUCH more.

Due to the above reasons, **I snort it.** 

* it lasts longer 
* it doesn't have the rush which is very intense to me and I hate it
* it is mellow 
* it makes me energetic for hours
* it makes me productive in work
* it will never let you nod without your permission in public, unless you overdid it with the dosage, or you added a Benzo to the cocktail 


>***WARNING: IV'ing the drug might seem cheaper in the beggining, but the rush and the whole high lasts much less than the snorting method. In 4-6 months you will be a person that after each hit, you will be looking for the next one. It will definetly be much more expensive in the long run.***



Why not try plugging it? The bioavailability is excellent. No abscesses. No being self-conscious about marks in your hands. No worrying about HIV and Hep C. Need I say more? IV'ing is the riskiest. Does the rush worth all that? No.

-----------------------------------

***And to the newbies:*** I promise. Snorting has an *excellent* rush. Please do not go to the needle. It's a whole other drug and demon we are talking about there. Snorting ***fucking rocks***!!!


-----------------------------------
***My Programme:***

**I snort Heroin 3 times a day:** 

* 200mg when I wake up 
* 100mg *before* lunch 
* 100mg 2 hours before sleep. 

**Flunitrazepam:**

* 2mg Flunitrazepam when I wake up
* 1.5mg *after* lunch, dissolving it under my tongue
* 0.5mg before getting into bed (and reddit).

--------------------------------------
**Daily cost**: Since AAA quality heroin here is 15$/gram, it means that I spend 7$ per day for Heroin. Roofies (the 2mg) cost 1$ in the streets, so I never add up the benzo expenses. I guess it's 2$ per day for benzos.

>***Total sum: 9$ per day for my 2 medicines.***

The strongest seeds, the most convenient methods.","I have experimented with poppy seed tea many times, and here is my low-down on the best and worst of it. Firstly, I have tried ""organic"" seeds from healthfood shops and have to say they were absolutely awful. They looked great! They even SMELLED great, and dare I say it but the tea looked fantastically dark and I was so excited for being utterly unconscious after struggling to down it. How disappointed I was, no effect.

I am from the UK and I have to say that the best seeds I can come across without ordering online are (drum roll)..... Morrisons own brand. I don't know why this is, they seem pretty potent and often have lots and lots of helpful little pod flakes in the packets. I use about 5 bags, which equates to 500g (I don't know imperial), and I use about 500ml of warm water with 50-100ml of lemon juice. The lemon juice definitely makes a difference as the same amount of seeds with no lemon juice has about a quarter the effect.

I put the 500g of seeds into an empty 2 litre bottle, preferably a milk bottle as the handle helps the shaking. I funnel the water, and lemon juice into the bottle and begin to shake. I shake consistently for about ten minutes, maybe fifteen, then strain through a piece of fabric (tights?) which I attach to the lid of the bottle with an elastic band.

I generally manage two pretty decent washes of one set of seeds.

I tried plugging it once, it was shameful and achieved nothing better than drinking. Don't do it friends!

I think you're crazy to ask me to write about my experiences, you do it as you want to do it. The strongest seeds, the most convenient methods. You use organic seeds, own-brand seeds, lemon juice, grapefruit juice, or just plain water. Correct? Does that answer your question?

I typically use morphine on a daily basis, and don't use to get high so much as to stay straight. I get a little elevated from my doses, but nothing like I used to get. 

I just came upon a ton of codeine and have been replacing about a third of my morphine dose with ~3x that figure in codeine orally. So I'm taking roughly the same amount of opiate when you look at their strength/BA, but I feel a much higher degree of positive effects - some euphoria, buzzing, head rush, itching (I actually enjoy the itch some). Has anyone else noticed this?

My case is especially strange because codeine essentially converts into morphine in the liver, correct? I mean, it would make more sense if you replaced some H with Opana. But I'm basically replacing morphine with a morphine precursor (in the loose sense of the word).",1365017693.0

I made a new account a couple days ago, and saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1bolf9/nice_read_im_sure_we_can_all_relate_to_xpost_from/) just now.  Wow.  So much of that story read identical to my current suicide note (not that I'm suicidal at this moment, I just like to keep one updated and current for whenever the time comes)... Having already experienced all of life's emotions, feeling nothing but *tired*, etc.  The only difference is, while I'm clean at this moment, I am very much looking forward to using again.    

Strange as it may seem, dope is the only thing that's kept me from finalizing and laying out that note so far.  I was at the end of the road years ago, stone sober, and figured if I was gonna check out anyway, I might as well at least see what all the hype about this heroin thing is first; afterall, what could it hurt, right?  Funny thing is, the shit gave me a reason to keep going.  Nothing seemed as shitty and pointless as it used to (well, still pointless, but definitely less shitty).  3 years later, cue a traumatic accident, and now I've moved back to my dad's house to recover, am 4+ months sober, and miserable as ever.  Yet again, the only thing keeping me going is dreaming of the day I get back on my feet with a big bag of nasty, beautiful tar... My parents know of my use, and are very supportive, helpful, and hopeful that I will find happiness elsewhere.  But how do you convey to people who love and care about you that you just don't give a fuck about ""being happy"" or ""getting better""?  The truth is, I'm bored as fuck with the monotony of life in general... working half of my waking life, and filling the rest of it with mindless entertainment and a plethora of pointless other activities.  I'm not miserable, I'm not lonely, I'm just fucking tired.  If I can find happiness in a syringe, and I hurt no one else in the process, whats the problem?  

I'm doing my best to put on a happy face for my folk's sake, and I haven't actively started looking yet (I'd like to try and wait until I'm back on my own and not sleeping on my dad's couch), but if I had a connect here I'd drop a grand right now and be comfortably numb for a week or two.    

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, whoever managed to make it this far, here comes the thank you... This subreddit has kept me sane for a long time, and especially lately.  I know we all use for different reasons, and I know some people truly want to break free from the hinderance that this shit can eventually become, but its great to have a place to go where people are so understanding of everyone in whatever their situation may be.  I've seen people give great advice to curious first timers, warnings about opening pandora's box, encouragement for non-harmful use, and support for others trying to stay clean, all within the same thread.  The level of non-judgement yet genuine care for people who willingly partake in what some would call risky behavior is something that I haven't found anywhere else.    

While I may not be able to partake at the moment, the pill/dope porn, expert advice, and great stories I find here will keep me sane for the time being.  So again, thanks, and happy nodding.    

edit: this post came off as very depressing/suicidal/etc.  I am honestly not, and don't want it to seem that way.  I just needed to vent, I am comforted by knowing that suicide is always an option (but I don't dwell on it too much), and once I started typing my fingers just wouldn't stop.  I am ok, and honestly just wanted to say thanks to this sub for helping me find a small sense of belonging that I've longed for in my day-to-day life.",1365148240.0

H->sub-> back to H....,"I was using about .15g-.3g a day of some pretty decent ECP (I'd say about equivalent to ~70-150mg of oxy a day)... Then got a sub strip, was determined to quit. I made the 8mg sub strip last me nearly a week, and had weened off pretty well (starting doses were around ~1.5mg each, my last dose was close to .5mg). About 8 hours after my last suboxone dose I was offered a single bag of H and took it without really thinking, and sniffed it. Normally that amount would never get me high (pretty skimpy bag) but it had me nearly nodding, so I figured I had successfully zeroed my tolerance and gotten rid of my physical dependence.

Then, this morning, which was about 24 hours after my last (.5mg) sub dose and about 16 hours after the H dose, I was feeling like complete shit. Definite w/d's. I tried going about my day, but couldn't stay in class or otherwise function doing anything I needed to do. I tried smoking hash oil and taking a bit of xanax, but I still felt like complete shit.

Then, a friend called and offered to sell me some H that he had just got as it was pretty good and fat bags, but I had no funds, and I explained my situation, and he offered to front me a few bags (if you see this, thanks again man). I did one, and feel pretty decent, but it feels so shitty to know that I'm still physically addicted. I really think that using that single bag probably fucked me over, and I don't think I would have felt nearly as bad this morning if the last thing I had used was that last .5mg dose of suboxone..

So, here I am again, needing to sniff H to function.. my tolerance is definitely way down and shit, but I really don't want to continue to need this stuff...

How long of a break do you think I need to take to be able to use again, and not be withdrawing the next day?? Like, if I take 2 weeks off opiates, and use again, will I end up putting myself through w/d's again or what?

So I arrived at her house at aroun 12pm and we sat and talked for a bit and she was watching ""Dances with Wolves"" and smoking pot out of a stone pipe. I chilled for a while talking, about a whole lot of nothing because she had indicated that ""her guy"" should be there by 1230 or 1245.  
  
Well, as we all know that deadline came and went and I waited some more as two other pill seekers joined us.  
  
Now for some background: This lady, Sandy, lives in an old rundown house with like 12 cats and almost everyone has either one eye or both eyes missing or somehow infected with... I don't know... disease I guess(so much eye gunk and I always have to kick (not hard you crazy cat lovers) them out of the way because they're mean as fuck.). The bathroom has shit ALL over the basin and just has a couple of big logs chilling in the and the whole house reeks of shit, animal waste, mold, body odor, and cigarette smoke.  
  
At some point in the last two months she started sharing this house with a guy only known as ""Pill Bill"". Obviously, Pill Bill was a low life and stole from her and did other such sheisty thing and was eventually arrested and put in jail.  
  
Okay, so anyway Sandy, these two other pill seekers (some couple), and me were waiting for the pill guy to come as 1:30 rolls around. At this point Sandy had been outside talking to her landlord, paying rent, when Pill Bill's mom rolls up to get his stuff. He was apparently suppose to have it ready to just go because she knew he would be going to jail at any moment.  
  
The mom and Sandy talk outside for a bit and Sandy says she has to go talk to this guy (the pill guy) and tell him she can't go with him (lie). Sandy hobbles over, jumps in this guys truck, and is gone leaving the mom outside not knowing what to do because she had apparently just left and wouldn't answer her phone... So she knocked on the door.  
  
We waited a second and then opened the door and the women told us her story and we haphazardly looked around for a suitcase on wheels, but found known. Right at that second, Sandy comes up the driveway yelling and screaming about how she had told the women to ""not go in [her] house!"" and not that they would go through things later because she didn't want ""none of [her] stuff stolen"". She told her many times to leave.  
  
At this point the poor woman, who has clearly been dealing with a drug addicted son for many, many years began to cry her eyes out and beg us to help her and explain that she didn't want to steal Sandy's stuff, just get her son's.  
  
Well, me and this 40 year old guy could just feel the hurt in this woman and I don't know about him exactly, but it cut me down hard because it made me think of all the shitty things I'd done to my mom or made her endure so I felt I couldn't just stand by and let Sandy treat her like that.  
  
I've known Sandy for a few years and she loves me to death so as the older guy went and started looking for the bag I went to Sandy to convince her that this lady DID NOT want to take ANYTHING that was not her son's property. She just wanted to get his clothes and other belongings and leave and with Sandy's cooperation we could do it in no time.  
  
We quickly rifled through all the piles of clothes and junk to find Pill Bill's stuff and start throwing it in plastic bags.  
  
I have never seen a human being so grateful in person in my entire fucking life. Even typing it now brings back those emotions and makes me a little teary because I could *feel* all the hurt and anguish and sadness as she thanked us profusely for helping her.  
  
We eventually got everything sorted and put in the woman's car and she drove away... I just hope someday she won't have to do things like this ever again. She was such a nice lady because she completely knew why we were all in that house and what went on, but all she cared about was her son.",1365249150.0

ok so heres what's going on with me.  I've been hooked on 10/325 norcos for like the past 4-5 years.  During this time, i've had only one job (which was a seasonal job) and pretty much have wasted my life being a zombie.  Anyways, so recently I thought enough was enough and I started looking for work.  My dad was able to get me an interview at his company for a cable installer position and even though my interview went great (by the way, going to interviews high is like the best thing ever, no pressure and you really have a chance to shine and say the best things about yourself) they did a background check on me and because of my misdemeanor wet and wreckless DUI from back in 08, he couldn't hire me.  He tells me though that he was going to refer my app to another position at a different location that doesn't involve driving.

So the next day, she calls and schedules an interview for today.  I went this morning and I think the interview went great.  She said for me to keep checking my email because further correspondence would happen that way and also for drug testing info etc.

So heres the thing, first off, do they even check for hydrocodone on the drug tests?  When I signed the paper I remember it saying prescription drugs but it didn't specify.  When should I stop using?  I heard its 2-3 days for opiates to be undetectable in urine, is this true?    

Like honestly I am ready to quit these things but I feel like i'm pressured to do it now just because I have a potential job opportunity.  I don't want to rush my withdrawal, it's already going to be a bitch as it is and I know I will need at least 5 days to be in bed but the thing is, the more I delay it, the harder it may be.  What if I get the job and then have to detox, that would be horrible.

Sorry I know this is kind of all over the place I just hate the position i'm in right now.  Oh I should also mention that my last pill will be on Friday since I have only enough til then, my connect has already shut down.

Then theres the possibility that I may not get the job at all for another unrelated reason.  If that was the case, i'd be starting my detox on Friday regardless but at least I wouldn't feel the pressure of a looming job and having to be somewhere at a certain time.

This just is all bad timing.

Has anyone had job offers or had to dealing with this sort of thing while also taking pills?  The drug test is like my main hurdle right now because I know if I can beat that, then I will have a great reason to get clean and start a positive outlook on life again.

TBH i'm kind of tempted to go to the emergency room tomorrow and fake a back injury just so I can score a doctors note and in case I get tested positive for opiates, I can show them that pater and i'm clear.  But I have no insurance right now and I do not want a 5 thousand dollar hospital bill over that.

Ok, so about a month ago I had my first meet up with a dude from the subreddit. He had a couple decades on me, but seemed like a really chill guy, and I was excited to finally get to meet another poppy enthusiast in my newly acquired home-town. I moved down here a couple years ago, but as an occasional user I never went cruising the ghetto to look for goodies or put myself out there in any way really in order to meet someone. So you can imagine my excitement when I get a PM from a guy who lives near me, asking to meet up and hang for awhile. It had been over a year since I had felt the sweet embrace of Lady Poppy and to say I was looking forward to it would be an understatement. Now, I have been taking suboxone for about 2 years at this point, and have been content to just maintain, abstaining from any kind of *real* buzz. I let him know that I had some, and we worked out a trade. I traded him 260 bucks worth of sub (at a very cheap rate, at least compared to what they go for back home) and in return he gave me a bundle of the local brown powder. We met up, got to know each other, and generally had a good time. He was running late, so we didn't get to hang out as long as I'd like, but he came through for me so I was happy, and went home to blast off. 

Now, it had been so long since I'd touched anything that I figured my tolerance would be pretty low. Boy, was I wrong. Even after 20+ hours   after my last suboxone, I sniffed 5 bags over the course of that night and *didn't feel a damn thing*. Not wanting to jump the gun, i told myself it must be the subs still in my system, so I went to bed and decided to do the other 5 bags the next day when I woke up. I put all 5 bags out on a plate, formed them into 1 thick line, and went to work, taking little sniffs every 10 minutes or so, taking care to coat my nostrils and not suck it all down my throat. After I got it all down, I began the wait for onset. And I waited... And waited... And nothing happened. Didn't even get pin eyes. Needless to say I was confused and upset. I sent him a text message saying ""If you'd just told me you were hurting I would've given you some subs for free man, no need to rip me off."" I figured that would be the last time I ever talked to him. I was wrong.

He called me a couple hours later expressing confusion. He said he had no idea why I didn't feel anything, that it was the same dope he'd been doing for months, and that it gets him buzzed up just fine. He made a point of saying that he never rips people off and apologized that I was unhappy with the stuff. I said whatever, chalked it up to a loss, and went back to the daily routine. I figured that would be the last time I ever talked to him. I wanted to post here and tell you guys about my experience, but I didn't know what to say. I still didn't know if I had gotten ripped off or if my tolerance was just so damn high that the dope wasn't cutting it. I didn't want to bash the guy if he genuinely *didn't* rip me off, but I didn't want to come on here and say the meet-up went great either without really knowing what happened. I told him I didn't want any more of that dope, but if he could get some pharms to let me know. He said he didn't get a hold of them very often, but that he would let me know if he did and we'd meet up again. So I just moved on. I had been stockpiling my meds for awhile, so the missing subs didn't fuck me, and at the very worst I wasted an evening. No big deal. 

Fast forward to last Monday. He sends me a text asking if I would mind parting with any more of my subs. I was very hesitant because of what happened last time, and I told him that since I don't normally sell them I would much rather do some trading. He told me his buddy was coming into town this weekend with some blues (roxi 30's) and asked if I wanted some. I said definitely, and that I would take as many as he could get in trade. He asked if he could come by and pick up a few subs until then, to get him through. Against my better judgement I said sure, and sold him 5 for the same low price as before. Now, as you can imagine, I was thinking at the time that he was just hurting and made up the bit about the blues so that I would part with some of my subs. Again, whatever, it's not hurting me and i could use some spare cash. He texts me again on Thursday asking if he can come get a couple more. He said he ended up sharing with his buddy who was in need, and that the blues were still coming but he needed to make a pick up before then if possible. I told him it was fine, to come on down. He called me a little while later and told me not to worry about it, that he was supposed to get the blues tomorrow (Friday, today) and that he would just wait until then so he could bring me some. I was surprised by this, because in the back of my mind I still had the thought that he was just making up the bit about the blues so he could buy subs from me. 

So today (Friday) comes, and I text him asking if everything's copacetic. Again, to my surprise, he says yes and that he will be headed to my house when he gets off work. I don't get my hopes up, but think about how nice it would be if he actually came through. Oh, I also asked him if he knew where any **good** bud was. He said that even though he rarely smokes, he happened to have some killer on him right now. I said awesome, and got everything done that I had to do for the day. So 4 o'clock rolls around, the time he said he would be off work, and I don't hear anything. I wait til about 4:45 to call him, expecting no answer or an excuse about how he couldn't get them but still needs the subs. I was very pleasantly surprised. 

He answers the phone and says he's en route to my house with everything he promised. I was ecstatic! He shows up, I jump in the car, and we proceed to bullshitting for awhile. He gave me a super fat eighth of some medical grade bud and 8 blues. I traded him subs for the whole amount. Even though I was giving him the subs for really cheap, I was still enormously grateful that he was willing to take the whole deal (blues *and* buds) for subs alone, as I probably wouldn't have been able to even complete the deal if he wanted cash instead. I split one of the blues with him for being such a bro, we talked about music and ""the good ol days"" for awhile, then we parted ways. 

Because of him, I am sitting here enjoying the first buzz I've had in almost 2 years. And it feels **WONDERFUL**. I still have no idea what went wrong the first time, but I have officially chalked it up to my own body chemistry/tolerance, and most certainly don't think he tried to get one over on me. I'm so glad I decided to give him another chance, because he truly is a great guy and it's great to have made a real friend from the r/opiates community. I will leave it up to him if he wants to reveal himself by commenting in the post. If he doesn't comment I'm not gonna blow his spot up by mentioning his user name in the main post. Suffice it to say that he is a really cool guy who came through for me. Even after I had all but written him off, and straight up called him a thief to his face (or phone). I really hope you read this dude, I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry for doubting you. You're a solid guy, and I foresee a long and mutually beneficial friendship between the two of us. My only regret is that we didn't get to actually hang for very long. We need to get together and shoot some pool or something. 

I had to write this because I know you check the sub almost every day and I wanted you to see (publicly) that I appreciate your efforts, and apologize for what I said after the first meet up we had. I hope you're having as good of a night as I am, because my night wouldn't be half as great if it weren't for you. To everyone else who took the time to read this, thank you too! Sorry for the huge wall of text, but I needed to get this out. I wanted to share my story so that it might restore some of your faith in your fellow bropiates. Not everyone is out to get you, or in it just for themselves. There are still some truly good dudes out there, and at least one of them is a member of this sub! Well I'm off to add a little of that delicious herbal extract to my nod. I really hope this makes it high up enough so that he gets to see it, it always makes me feel good when I read about a successful meet-up between Redditors of the poppy persuasion!

I've quit everything (amph/benzos/weed) 2 weeks ago and the depression was just getting a bit better when I got high last night in a dream for my first time. I've never done opiates before, I've thought long and hard about it and I don't think it would help me knowing what the high feels like. Sometime in the future I will.

I was sitting in a cafe in some town with a bunch of friends when the waitress brought the 'menu'. There was everything from heroin HCl for 9.95 to codeine for 3.90. I opted for one of the 4 kinds of dilaudid for 7.90. My brain is seriously awesome for creating that menu. I got a little yellow pill of which I initially decided to snort 1/4 while my friends gave me a look, half disgusted, half astonished by my recklessness. The yellow pill turned purple when crushed and the powder was kinda sparkly. I felt something happening, and the scenery changed back to my home town. I was flying through the streets and decided I'd snort another 1/4 while being in the middle of a bunch of police officers (???). I got a fuzzy undefinable buzz from it. I can only imagine what opiates feel like, and I'd say it went slightly in that direction. I definitely wasn't sober anymore. The dream was suddenly happier, and the weather in that town changed from cloudy to sunny. 

2 or 3 days passed and I must have gone back to that cafe a bunch of times. I thought that today is the last day I'm doing this stuff as I was walking through that town, high as fuck on my dream opiates, enjoying the shit out of everything when I met an old friend sitting by the water, rolling a spliff. He asked for my assistance and I obliged. We talked for what felt like ages while I was rolling the joint, it was a very superficial conversation but I was just content with everything. I lit the joint, the dream ended and I woke up. Sun is shining today for the first time in months.

No idea what to make of it.

Crying because I'm afraid of withdrawing.,"This isn't my first auto accident. My boyfriend crashed his ATV with me on the back in 2011 and I had serious bone fractures so they put me on oxycodone and I was up to 30mg a day for about 3 months. I remember tapering off but the withdrawal was still so memorable and nightmarish. I cried for days on end for about a week.

Well in March, I had a serious head on collision with my civic and suffered much worse injuries and they gave me Oxycontin OPs (the time released ones) and I told them about my tolerance and somehow I'm up to 80mg every 12 hours. I knew about the withdrawal when I took them again but I was in so much pain and was told these were less potent when it came to withdrawal.

Well I went onto forums and apparently that's not the case. I'm so scared that I'll have to go through that nightmare again and I'll have to do NA meetings or rehab. I'm afraid to take suboxone or methadone though but it's become clear that I'm now an addict.

So I've been taking the pills for 2 months but can't stop. I tried stopping cold turkey for 2 days because you're not supposed to cut these but oh it was horrendous. All I could think about was taking more and I have. I'm afraid to flush them.

Can anyone give me any comforting thoughts? I'm so scared right now. ;'( 


What are the chances of getting PAWS?

Are there ways of tapering? My doctor said they can't be tapered because he didn't want to switch me to any other drug in fear the addictive qualities would get worse. He suggested cold turkeying them.

How long does Oxy OP w/d usually last?

Is taking lopermide and DXM safe during w/d?

How bad is the depression? Can it cause suicidal thoughts?

As an avid fan of dope, I was immediately enticed and bought the vial ($5!) on the spot. 

I'm sort of on the fence about whether or not it's plausible that this is #4 heroin. On one hand, I'm well aware of most antique collectors and seller's tendencies to clean out any unidentified pharmaceutical containers, and it's sort of hard to believe that an old bottle of heroin would just end up in an antique shop. On the other hand, it was sitting with some old pill bottles and other pharmaceutical sundries, so who knows? Unless the person who put it out in the store was familiar with heroin, there'd be no reason to think the #4 label would mean anything.

Plugging and Smoking in The UK.,"I thought it worth offering my two cents regarding the state of gear in the UK at the moment. Seems we brits are privy to a particular type of H not found very often in the Americas - No 3, or brown base.

What to do with this powder?! All the Americans are used to fantastic No 4 that can be snorted so easily! No need for acids, dissolves perfectly in your mucous membranes. But what are we little Englanders to do with our base?!

Well, for those not partial to injecting (myself included) I've discovered a few things over many many months experimenting, here are my discoveries ranked in order of effectiveness.

1 - The most effective route I have found is (drum roll) Plugging! You prepare as you would for injection (following all the safety procedures) but personally I never allow to boil for fear of burning up the good stuff, gentle heat is more than enough - if it starts to bubble you're in trouble!. Once prepared, suck the brown/black liquid up into an oral syringe, lubricate, lie down on your front somewhere comfortable (you'll be there a while), insert into the anus, push the plunger, wait 20 minutes for absorption! I have found the onset is not quick, but it has long legs and feels best even with totally lame quality stuff.

2 - Insufflation. Now, I know what you're thinking, ""It is a BASE you moron, your mucous membranes don't allow it to dissolve properly - what a WASTE"". True, so here is what I do and I get a really fantastic result. First, I sniff a droplet or two of plain old lemon juice mixed with water (3 parts water 1 part lemon usually works fine) up both of my nostrils, do my very best to retain it up there and not have it drip back or forward. Then, once I am happy the inside of my nose and sinus is fairly moist and coated with the slightly acidic preparation - I sniff a bump or line of the base. The acid from the lemon juice helps to break it down. While I am not guaranteeing 100% breakdown, the method is simple and it works pretty well if you want minimal preparation.

3 - Smoking. Honestly I don't know what to say about smoking, I am either not very good it at it or it just plain isn't a very good ROA. I park a chunk onto a thin piece of tin foil, the thinner the better, I place a hand-crafted foil tube (about 1cm in diameter) into my mouth, hold it between my teeth, heat the chunk and allow it to run down the piece of foil, all the while 'chasing' the vapour. It is pretty easy after a couple of attempts, but in my experience isn't all that effective.

If you can withstand the invasion, stick it up your bum, occupation by the armies of The Peoples Republic of Heroin are worth the potential embarrassment. ",1365292500.0

1btkti,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1btkti/question_about_withdrawals/,12,https://redd.it/1btkti,under_cover_lover,[Question] About Withdrawals,"I've been using opiates casually for the last 4 years of my life. Slowly my tolerance has built up from about 15mg of oxycodone orally to ~80mg orally, or 50mg potentiated (Tagamet HB, white grapefruit + tonic water cocktails, benadryl, triple c's, tums, aleve) so you can see I haven't quite dived deep into it, rather slowly setting my feet in the water before sliding all the way in. I had been drinking opium tea for some time as well and this upped my tolerance more than I expected, because you can't really measure how much is in it, you just drink until you nod.

I was really surprised the other day when I took an entire OP 60, chopped up & dissolved into some diet coke, and wasn't getting nods (cause 60mg of oxy is a ton right? well for me it seemed like it). I've felt a stronger urge to re-dose lately, which makes me think about addiction and withdrawals.

For some background: I've only ever done opiates twice a week at most, and I never do opiates on back-to-back days. I'd rather have a few *amazing* nods than be on opiates all the time. I have never withdrawn/had an addiction. Right now this is where I am at, 45-50mg of oxy potentiated to get mild nods.

**So let me ask you this**: When did you first start getting withdrawals from opiates? Were they very subtle at first? If I keep using at the pace I am using (twice a week at most, never back-to-back) can I still develop a serious addiction/withdrawals? Is this the point where I should take a break?

Discussion about Lopermide and it's effectiveness when battling WD's!","I've been talking to quite a few Redditors whom unfortunately are going through WD's atm. I'm a huge advocate of Lopermide, the active ingredient in Immodium when dealing with withdrawls. For me it relieves anywhere from 90-100% of the symptoms which include: no more muscle aches (leg/back), reduction in nasuea, reduction in anxiety, no more cold sweats (or greatly reduced), helps with insomnia (you can actually get comfortable enough to get some sleep). These are just personal results, but I've only had 1-2 out of the 50 or so people I've suggested this to throughout my life say it didn't help much. But it always helps. Here's the post I've been answering with to most of you. Hope you find it helpful. Feel free to discuss your experiences with Lopermide!

Lopermide.It's the active incredient in Immodium, which is a molecule off from Fentanyl. You can start with it and taper down, or just use it for the worst of the w/d's. For me, and others I've suggested it to, have stated that about 90-95% of the WD symptoms disappear. You are able to sleep, pains subside, able to retain body heat, no sweats. The only symptom that doesn't completely come under control is you can still get snotty and sneezy, but with enough this subsides as well. You just have to take enough until you hit that ""magic dose"" which you feel almost completely well. I've felt completely well off of them before, some say they experienced some euphoria, but I haven't experienced anything like that. It truly amazing stuff.

Where to go from here?,"So, I made a post the other day about how I had dislocated my shoulder (again) and will likely need surgery. The ER scripted me 15x5mg (75mg total) hydrocodone, but with my tolerance that really didn't do much (the day before/ day of receiving the script I also sniffed ~9 bags of H)..

I held off using the hydros as long as I could, and actually managed to make it about 24 hours before I took any of them (I still had a bit of H I was finishing up, which made it easier to hold off on using the hydros). Saturday I got the script, but only used heroin that day, probably about ~125mg of good H throughout the day (around here that's about 5 stamp bags worth)..

I took 30mg of hydrocodone yesterday morning, which I potentiated (benadryl and xanax) and got a decent buzz, which was kinda unnexpected but figured since I was switching to an opiate I don't use often, it probably hit me harder than usual. Later yesterday, in the afternoon, I took 22.5mg potentiated, and didn't get high, but definitely took enough to feel comfortable. I was pretty happy I was able to fall asleep last night having only taken 52.5mg of hydro, which was a relatively low daily intake compared to what I've been using.

This morning I woke up at about 5am, like 12-14 hours after my last dose of hydrocodone, feeling definite (although not terrible) w/d's. Most noticeable symptom was restless legs, making it impossible to sleep. Luckily I wasn't feeling nauseous, which is usually the most pronounced and debilitating w/d symptom for me... I tried taking a xanax and smoking a bowl to get back to sleep, but it didn't really help much.. After rolling around long enough that I felt it was justified I could take my last 22.5mg of hydro, I got up and popped 50mg benadryl and 22.5mg of hydrocodone (bout 7am this morning).. Figured I had waited long enough that the hydrocodone would keep me well for a good part of the day, at least get me through my first few classes...

So, now I'm supposed to be going to see a surgeon today or tomorrow, and I'm pretty positive I could get more painkillers. Last time I had this injury I had no problem getting scripts of 60x5mg hydros... but then again, I just don't know.

blah blah blah blah.. I'm gunna be w/ding in a few hours and I really don't want to be.

starting to realize this post was pointless. sorry I wasted your time. I'm starting to feel good enough to function, so I'm gunna go get my day started...

1bwkmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1bwkmu/santa_cruz_dope/,12,https://redd.it/1bwkmu,jmon123,Santa Cruz Dope,"So I get dope occasionally from SF but usually just mess with pills. I live in Santa Cruz and have heard mixed reviews about dope here. There were some infamous MS13 that were selling dope in a spot I used to pass everyday. I parked near it once and like every 3rd car stopped and asked if I was getting H. I didn't know what they were talking about until I heard about 'heroin hill' on the news. Fuck those guys littering needles and shit in a really nice park. I've heard that dope was fucking terrible.

I've also heard there is some delivery service where if you get a magic phone number you can get it delivered to you very quick. Supposedly it's like $80 a gram and is pretty solid Salinas dope. Now, I hang out with upscale college kids who are obsessed with working out and drinking once a week or so. They don't know I fuck around with substances except maybe one of them. They can't help me find this shit. I don't really know any shady people.

So I've been thinking about trying to cop some. I've never done it before. I know exactly where to look and I'm sure I'd find someone offering something. Would that be very dangerous? I want this goddamn number so fucking bad. I really don't have the money to buy anything off the silkroad. Do I just ask homeless people for tar? I've bought acid and some pills of the street, but that was in SF and very very easy. This is kind of a sketchier drug which makes me nervous.

so a few days ago a fentanyl patch came into my possession. i have never had the opportunity to try fent before. the patch that i have is the Mylan type and is 75 mcg/hr - and on the label in really small print it says ""7.65 mg fentanyl"". im sure you guys know what i have.

so before everyone jumps all over me for not doing my research and just posting here - i did do some research. obviously ive come to realize how powerful and, hmmmm, dangerous? fentanyl is. also from what i gather - the Mylan brand is not the one with the gel that everyone loves so much. ive read that the best bet with this kind of patch is to cut it up and stick it in your lip - like chewing tobacco. i wanted to make this post because i have a fairly high tolerance so i feel like i need to take a lot but - reading a lot of other posts - they made me hesitant to just jump right into it. 

so here are my questions:

how exactly is the best way for me to ingest this getting the most out of it?

my tolerance is pretty high (takes quite a lot of ecp to get me nodding) so how much should i take?

should i cut it up like ive read? and if you guys do recommend doing this ""chewing tobacco method"" how small should i cut the pieces up in? (also i havent even opened up the packaging so im not even sure what it looks like)

like i said - i got a bun today. now if i do said bun today and dont have any left for tonight - would it be safe for me to take the fent while having all this h in my system already? or should i wait for a day when i cant get any h and just ride it out tonight?

so i guess basically what im asking is for a crash course for someone with my habit/tolerance. thank you everyone in advance.

1byvuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1byvuh/dea_decided_we_are_not_in_enough_pain/,24,https://redd.it/1byvuh,IGuessItsMe,"DEA decided we are not in ""enough"" pain","My story from today, which I am trying to spread and have sent to members of congress, state government and media. It is chilling, if you have ongoing chronic pain. PM me for proof if you want it.

DEA has decided I am not in ""enough"" pain.

Today my wife and I visited 17 different local pharmacies, to refill my prescriptions for pain medication. We will try again tomorrow. And the next day. And the next. I am not optimistic.

Three back surgeries so far, and I face another, possibly two. My life is brutal pain from dawn until twilight. I have seen the same doctors for six years, and have filled these exact prescriptions during that time at the exact same Walgreens and CVS stores. I know and am friendly with the staff. My wife carries a complete copy of my medical records. Documenting every surgery, every needle that's been driven into my spine, every procedure. Today, every single pharmacy was united in their message: Your records no longer matter. The three inch thick pile of records proving I am in severe pain ""no longer counts."" Nor could they tell me what WOULD count, what WOULD make a difference. Because, you see, they do not know either. They were plainly confused and fearful. Most didn't really want to talk about this at all.

Today my pharmacist told me that they would probably never carry any schedule 2 medications again. At Walgreens. At ALL locations. Forever. Just as frightening, he told me he's not supposed to share this. He is only permitted to hand out a prepared statement from corporate that says, ""Due to changing requirements, we will no longer fill your prescription."" No explanation, no method to appeal, nothing more to be done or said. Not even a vague idea provided about how to ""meet"" these nonexistent requirements.

I called Humana, my insurer, about mail order options. They said my medication was covered by the plan but that it ""would be illegal for them to allow me to have it."" I asked for clarification. She repeated the quoted phrase four more times before I gave up. This defies the most basic ideas of common sense. It verges on parody and is offensively absurd. 

DEA has vilified a legitimate and useful medication that has improved my life and the lives of countless others. It is reprehensible, disgusting, and morally wrong. Pharmacy personnel are afraid of violating rules--but no one KNOWS the rules. No one told them. They fear being tossed out of a job or into a jail cell.

I use 150 fifteen mg pills per month. Five per day. DEA regularly trumpets headlines like ""We shut down a pharmacy that distributed nearly 200,000 doses of Oxycodone last year."" I hope you understand that means they served about 1,000 people in my level of pain. In a county with nearly 500,000 people, and in a city the size of the Tampa Bay Area, these numbers seem perfectly reasonable.

I am keenly aware of the illicit trade as well, and am hopeful that it is improving. However, those of us in real pain are being abandoned, left behind in a DEA witch hunt that will only hurt all of us. And seems to have no safety net for those in true need.

When the day comes that I run out of my current medication, and cannot fill my new prescriptions, I have a plan of sorts. I will simply go to the ER and ask to be admitted. Or ask my primary doctor to admit me. I am certain she will, she knows the great efforts I have undergone to get well. Then, I will at least have the pain relief I need. Of course, it will cost taxpayers tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions of dollars. Because of medicine that is really worth a couple dozen dollars, at most.

Somehow I doubt this outcome is what anyone envisioned, but it is coming. And I will advise the other chronic pain patients I interact with in person and online forums to do the same. A very large-scale, very expensive, but vital protest. Which also assures us that we will have the pain relief we require.

Please work on a solution. Please help me. Please help us. I have all my records. I am willing and ready to meet with you, to share these records, to tell you my story. I worked for many years in TV/Radio with colleagues and friends in more than 200 major cities from Los Angeles to D.C. and Fairbanks to Miami. I plan to share this with my colleagues at those media outlets. I am hopeful something can be done, but the clock is not only ticking, it is a roaring inferno.

Meanwhile, people in genuine pain suffer. Like me.",1365479919.0

Around here, bags are skimpy as fuck. Most dealers put ~.3g per bundle, meaning each bag has ~30mg in it. Here's a picture of one bag dumped out, and 2 other bags that haven't been touched (next to some hydro 5/500's for size reference): [Stamp bags and hydros](http://i.imgur.com/McdWzdp.jpg)

That is pretty typical. I've gotten from several different people and still, the absolute fattest bag I've received around here was ~50mg.... its really fucking annoying, and a dumb way to sell a drug. I really would like to just buy by weight, but everyone sells in bundles because its just so much easier to fuck people over this way.

Also, it makes it way easier to get a charge for ""intent to distribute"" or whatever. I don't even have a big habit, and I could easily blow through 10 bags in a day, so if someone had stocked up for a week and bought ~50 bags for themselves, it would be a reasonable amount for personal use, but if they got pulled over they would definitely be treated as a dealer for having so many individual bags... it just doesn't make sense.

I'd like to see what other people get... Around here, I think bundles probably go for aroun 60-70 dollars, but I end up paying white-boy prices and almost never get a bundle for less than 100 dollars.. its fucking stupid, I hate having to rip open several bags just to get a fucking high.

I'd rather just buy by weight, even if I was still paying 100 per .3g, it would be nice to know I'm actually getting a consistent amount, instead of some random amount...

every time I get stamps, its like a gamble.. I could be getting some decent shit, in which case its WAY more economical to do dope instead of oxy, but sometimes I get really REALLY skimpy bags where like 5 bags barely gets me high, and I end up snorting 100 dollars in a night.

its bullshit. Stamp bags are bullshit. If you're a dealer, please just sell to people in weight.",1365464189.0
1by1ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1by1ya/stamp_bags_are_bullshit/,37,https://redd.it/1by1ya,crack-cocaine-novice,Stamp bags are bullshit,"Its just such a fucking stupid way to sell the drug, making it SO much easier to rip people the fuck off... It completely simplifies the customer and makes it so much easier to overcharge for less product. Around here, stamp bags are hardly ever more than ~35mg each, I think the fattest I've ever seen locally was ~50mg each. From what I understand, most dealers break a gram of powder into 3 bundles.

Then they sell these bundles anywhere from ~80-130 each, depending on how badly you're getting fucked over/ who your connect is, etc. You end up paying like 300 a fucking gram.

Even when I have absolutely no tolerance, I can't imagine just using 1 bag in a session and being satisfied... maybe its just a shitty market around here, but it fucking sucks.

In baltimore (the only other place I've copped dope), they sell in capsules (which they call scramble, its just extremely cut, heroin mixed with quinine) which always had .1g or significantly more in each one, and one was enough to get me fucked up... and if they aren't selling in capsules, they sell straight up by weight, usually ~120 a gram.

The market where I'm at now fucking SUCKSSSSS (ny state, pretty far from the city)

just paid 60 dollars for 5 stamp bags, probably the best I've seen in awhile, but still, like always they have 30mg of powder in each, and I'd blow through 2-3 in a session without even thinking about it if I had more money on hand. And my tolerance isn't even high at all, 40mg of hydrocodone has me pretty high at the moment.

I find it crazy that so many people continue buying this shit despite the market here being so fucked.. Like, seeing people just rip open 4-5 bags at a time and sniff it all at once, just as the initial dose, and not even think about the fact they just ingested ~50 dollars worth of drugs that should be worth ~15 dollars.... but then here I am, ripping open a few bags myself just to get that high. :-/

/end rant

EDIT: one good thing is that usually the powder is relatively uncut.. like, one of the tiny ~30mg bags is usually equivalent to ~10-15mg of oxy. Its still fucking bullshit prices though.

EDIT again: and before you tell me to go to silk road, I know all too well about it.. Its just that usually opiates are a ""I need it NOW"" type thing, so its hard to plan ahead and place orders that won't get to you for days or whatever.. plus, I live with other people, so I try and not put them at risk to feed my addiction, so I stay away from SR, or any mail service.",1365457672.0

My Opiate love affair began about two years ago. Hydrocodone has always been my favorite. It's always given me the cleanest pure euphoria and energy, unlike anything else that I have ever tried. I always heard that Oxy was preferable, but it never gave me the euphoria that Hydro did. Even at higher doses, it just left me sedated. I have tried Dilaudid, which did pretty much the same and Opana, which seemed to have a more agressive euphoria that I didn't enjoy nearly as much. I did a short stint of Pod Tea, which I loved, but ended up giving up a few months back because I didn't want to develop a massive tolerance. I always came back to Hydro.

It started with 10mg and I would be good for the day. I would do this on Saturday and Sunday. That lasted a while. Probably about a year. Then, I don't remember when, I decided to pop one at work. It made the day go by so much faster, and it made me what I considered a more likable, talkative person. I know this was my downfall, because since I discovered this, I haven't been able to relegate use to just the weekends anymore. I redose about three times during the work day now and i'm up to about 40mg. Usually 10mg at 9am, another 10 a couple of hours later than another 20 after 2. Today I have taken 45mg, and while I feel that opiate sedation, the clean high is gone. No longer do I feel that have to talk feeling I used to. I know tolerance is a fucking bitch, but it's depressing. I know I can't keep this up, because the more I need to take, the less I feel like I wish I would. Back when 10mg was my perfect dose. I also don't want to quit for good, so I am not sure of what to do right now. Would giving it a break allow me to go back to feeling the perfection that I used to, or have I crossed a line that won't go back?

My presumption is that I should just wait about 24 hours and that it'll probably be fine at that point regardless of how I feel. It was a small shot anyway, as I didn't have much H on hand, so it probably isn't a big deal. Just thought I'd get your 2 cents in the meantime.

Today I left her in the car and ran in with her rx to drop it off while taking her home.  I wanted to drop it off, take her home, and come back to pick it up.  The doctor said she would be ok for four or five hours in terms of pain.

Today the pharmacy wouldn't take possession of the loriitab Rx paper without my drivers license! I didn't have it on me, but did have it in the car.  I ran out to get it.

Then the fucking pharmacy tech wanted to SEE my gf.  She said that my prescriptions seemed suspicious.  

I was dropping off (for me) 1) Pristiq - daily anti-depressant, 2) Xanax - for anxiety, I fill it every four or five months and my last Rx had expired before reaching all refills, 3) An anti-nausea drug for migraines, 4) Fioricet for migraines (It has caffeine, tylenol, and some kind of pain medicine).  The migraine meds were from one doc, the mental health meds from another.

For my gf I was dropping off 1) the loritabs, 2) her blood pressure medicine.  The loritabs were from her surgeon, her blood presser med was from our GP (the same as gives me the migraine meds).

I had a fit and told the tech that my gf had just had about 1/4 of her cervix carved out and that she was having so much vaginal bleeding that she was sitting on two towels and I was still worried about blood on my car seat.  She relented.

Is this normal?  To require a license to drop off an Rx?  To ask to see the person for whom the medication is intended?  She is on my insurance plan and we both get all of our medication from this pharmacy.

The shot was an amber color so I know it still had some H in it. I was only doing .25mg of sub but, I thought that the sub would block all the H anyway.

When I did the shot there was no rush. Just that normal bupe taste in the back of my throat. I figured the H was completely blocked until an hour later when I began feeling that familiar warm feeling behind my eyes. It was a slight but, noticeable opiate high.

WTF, I didn't know this was possible. I am pleasantly surprised but surprised none the less. 

Has anyone else out there had any experience with mixing bupe with another opiate and getting an effect? Or is this some placebo left over from my H use from the day before?

Any advice would be super duper appreciated!,"Alright, so I know a guy who lives pretty nearby me, and he would be a perfect dealer if he wasn't so goddamn expensive.  He has pretty much every drug at his disposal, and most of them are decent(irregardless of the fact they are exorbitantly priced..)but his dope was TERRIBLE.
It wouldn't even dissolve in water, and it would take about a 6-8 bag shot just to feel WELL for anyone with a tolerance.

Anyway, I know someone who has some fire dope at reasonable prices (80 a bun in Brooklyn), so I figured I would connect the two.  After much back and forth, I got the guy in BK down to 55 a bun if my bronx guy bought 20 or more. So I took $1100 from the Bronx to BK, got 20 buns, and brought it back.  For this, I was expecting two things: 2 buns, and the ability to get the BK dope in the Bronx for $80.

Neither happened.  First off, he gave me ONE bun for my efforts-keep in mind this cost me $30 in gas, and $20 in tolls, nevermind the fact I was carrying a felony amount of dope in my car.  He also ended up claiming that even though his last dope was crap, it was CHEAP (40 a bun), and it made no difference to him, because he didn't use, and he had enough customers.  He DID admit that his main guy was raving about how awesome it is.  So now he is saying that he is gonna be charging $15 a bag or 125 a bun for the Brooklyn stuff.

Act 2: I can get OP80 for pretty cheap.  The guy usually charges around $20-$25 a pop, but if you buy out his whole script, he will do $10 a pill. So, 60 pills, $600.  I told him I want at least a bun for that, but he is claiming he ""Already paid me."" I want to just tell him to fuck right off, but the problem is he is in the latin kings.  At this point, I am considering just replacing the bun he gave me and we'll go our separate ways.  On top of this, I have someone else who is interested in these pills, and he is willing to give me 10% of his profit, which would work out to about $250. 

Can you guys think of some amicable way we can come to a resolution?  I really don't want to piss this guy off, because he's pretty scary and runs with a scary crowd, but he is definitely fucking me.

Before all the hate rolls in, I realize I'm a huge vagina and I should stay out of the kitchen if I can't take the heat, but he talked so sweet at the beginning, and I bought every word of it.

Does it give you a mood change, even if not a high?","Or, to put it another way, for another **TL;DR:** if you use opioids because you feel like shit without them, *and did before you even started* (i.e not due to PAWS etc), does buprenorphine (Suboxone) help you feel better? (Methadone's in the title, but I kinda wish I had taken it out, as I'm pretty sure it will work, being a full agonist; I'm just not yet quite resigned to that hassle.)

&nbsp;
I just want to live a life where I am productive and can enjoy things, but only opioids seem to give me that. I *am* physically addicted, again, but nowadays my usage is so low so that withdrawal is comparatively mild. It's not fear of kicking that's making me contemplate Suboxone, but the fact that life before opioids was miserable. Opioids seem to fill some void in me; I truly feel they're therapeutic -- a small dose every day completely changes my quality of life, even when I'm not noddin'-off high. That's why I keep coming back. I got a degree and into grad school on opioids... I dropped out and ended up briefly homeless while *sober*.

&nbsp;
Of course, there is difficulty in discerning between ""feels nice because high"" and a legitimate mental problem being treated by opioids (and I would be very surprised if none can be so treated: to paraphrase one of my favorite sites, it'd be odd if the endogenous opioid peptide system were the only one that never malfunctioned!). There's probably a continuum. I make no *excuses* for my use -- whether there's a medical reason behind it or not, I just love opioids and I can't stay away. Yes, during my clean periods (longest has been *almost* a year, since I started about five years ago), I have tried every traditional psychiatric remedy I am willing to (no MAOIs or ECT yet).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
So, **TL;DR again:** I don't really have to worry about withdrawals (yet), but I don't think I can ever stay away anyway, as I feel like opioids are treating my mental/emotional problems. *If anyone else has used for the same reason* (self-medication), please let me know if buprenorphine scratched that itch and let you function, or if it would be a waste of time and money for me to try!",1365748692.0

I was there just a few months before.  The last time that I walked out of those doors I was sure I'd be clean for life.  I went to NA meetings every day, I had a sponsor and lots of sober friends.  One of my sober friends and I ended up relapsing together, he was a meth freak and I was a heroin junkie so we figured if we shot coke together we'd be fine.  Of course I spiralled back into full blown addiction again and ended up back here again.  Though this time I had no energy or confidence.  Plus it was during christmas and new year's so it was extra shitty.  I managed to talk a guy who was getting out to smuggle me in 3 30's, a half gram of tar, and a needle.  I promised i'd pay him when I got out (lol what an amateur).  The only needle he could get me was worn and dull.  I went to the bathroom and shot up everything but 1 30.  My tolerance was low so I was torn up.  After I loaded the last shot I dropped the needle and it landed on the dirty public bathroom floor.  The needle bent 90° and the tip was nearly blunt.  I was determined to press on.  The needle struggled to break the skin until it jerked in violently snapping off the needle into my skin.  I could see the end peeking out and I tried to grab it but accidentally pushed it all the way in.  I kept this incident to myself until I failed a random drug test.  They told me I needed to go to the er asap but my family refused to take me so they had to call a squad.  The hospital could not locate the needle and discharged me.  When I got back to the rehab they told me I had to leave.  I had no phone, no wallet, and no money and it was the middle of the night.  The only person I had to call was my dad and he wanted nothing to do with me.  I begged him to help me out because it was snowing and below freezing out and I had nowhere to go.  I told the staff about my predicament and they said it wasnt their problem.  When they discharged me I was given my remaining meds which included a full bottle of sleeping pills.  I walked to a cemetary down the street from the facility.  I laid down on a cement gazeebo and ate 30 sleeping pills then dozed off shivering. Someone eventually found me because I woke up in the hospital where I stayed for a couple of days strapped to the bed.  Then I was forcibly taken to a pysch ward for observation.  I stayed there for two weeks until I convinced them I wasn't crazy.  The day I got out I finally got ahold of some friends and managed to get some dope and fell out bad.  My friends said I was so bad off they were close to carrying me out of there so I wouldnt die in their apartment.  I wish I could say this was the lowest time of my life.

Spent a half hour pan handling at a gas station and was able to get $60 so i got 4 bags. Anyways, the stuff was a light brown powder, not tan, but a little darker. I read mixed things about what im supposed to do with it (heating vs not heating) so i decided it would be best to try and cold shoot it.

I poured the powder in the spoon, added water, and stirred it. It all disolved, no powder was left in the spoon. Drew it up, tied off, shot up. There was no rush though, nothing like morphine or Dilaudid. A few minutes later I felt it slowly come up. It was a nice warm feeling but i didn't really feel all that high, just mild euphoria, no sedation. Honestly I feel more from a 4mg Dilaudid. 

I do a second bag and same thing, no rush, slowly came up and it still left me expecting more. Ive done H before, it was grey, and I remember it being much better than this, but then again I use to do Blues religiously and had just acquired one a few days ago and didn't think it was as great as I remember.

Before I do these last 2 bags I would like a little bit of advice. Should I cook it (like morphine: add powder, water, heat till bubbles, draw up) or is it probably just really weak stuff? I assume that if it needed to be cooked it wouldn't have disolved so easily. I don't feel sedated nor itchy. Just hoping I didn't get ripped off. Coulda bought D's instead.

Finally decided to make an account after falling in love with reading every post on here, from you snarky bastards making fun of kids asking about 500mg hydros to wrenching my heart and practically bringing me to tears with stories of lost loved ones. My pupils never prick without thoughts of coming here to see whats going on In my favorite community. I've always been at home whenever my sweet pharmaceuticals grab hold of my pleasure receptors. Some come sit down and listen to a little story I have to tell. Its not much but offer a little entertainment is the least I can do when you guy's get me through my sickest sick days. 

My tale begins with a rare occasion. I happen to finally reap the harvest of my blood, sweat, and tears and have more then a little cash to spare, for the first time in months. I call up my bud to see what type of opiods he has, that may grace my nostrils. ""oh hey bud"" he says after picking up after three rings, his husky voice sounding like  music to my ears. ""lucky for you all my plugs got back from the pharmacy, And my medicine cabinet looks like a candy store. What to you want, I've got blues, opana 10 ir's and the white triangle dillies"" Sweet merciful lord, My heart races and I practically break a sweat. He never has anything more then greens, and on rare christmas like occasions the purplish gray 20's. Having a grand ready to spend on my supplies, I tell him i'll pick up fifty blues, twenty five opas and twenty dillies, He chuckles and tells me to meet him at our usual spot, the greasy little sub shop parking lot downtown. 

I practically skip over to his car and he hands me three baggies looking just as fat as they should be and he says he threw in some extra subs in a fourth larger bag, just in case I binge a little too hard. I'm a little surprised and grateful, but the bag looks a little big for just some of the plasticy foil wrappers of subs, but hell who am I to complain? I just manage not to kiss him on the cheek as I jog in to hit the shops bathroom and chop out a line. As I sat down on my my porcelain throne I pull out a blue and an opa, lay them on my bill and grind them to a pulp with my bic lighter, I smile, realising I still have enough greenery to buy two ounces of greenery. I bend over and sniff the lines off of my 40 oz to freedom cd case I slipped into my denim jacket. Oh that sweet drip, the taste is so sickly sweet and bitter. My gaze lowers too the cd case as I swirl my finger over it and lick the residue off my fingers. Man bradley. Why did you have to boot that fat shot and off yourself. I never even got to see you live. A sigh slips out of my lips as my eyes roll back in my head and the warmth envelopes me. A big cheshire grin creeps onto my face and I chuckle at the graffiti in the stalls. a couple of toys trying to show off their handstyles and a dick here and there. One particularly vulgar line sticks in my mind ""dont be a quitter, put it in her shitter"". 

As I float off the toilet and back into the real world my mind is at ease. The tensions and stresses of my day are far and few between. I get a call from a close friend of mine (the only other user I partake with) saying he's in the area and asks if I want to go to a party with him. Im higher then flavah flave on helicopter with a crack pipe, so sure why not. maybe she'll even be ther-""oh and guess what dude, rhiannas there. She's asking where you are. Shes thirsty"". I break out laughing at my friends use of the word thirsty but hell, Im dancing over to his car when he pulls up. Rhianna is the cutest most enticing perfect female I'd ever met, (except cayce, but thats another heartbreak to be told over another line). When I get to the party she practically grabs me by my jacket and pulls me into the guest room. Am I dreaming. Is this actually happening or is this some pipe dream induced by my own cocktail of drugs. 

No.

Its real.

The scent of her skin and the taste of her lips, oh my god the way she undressed and crawled onto me. The most sensual two hours of my life proceeded over another couple blues and she fell asleep in my arms, practically purring she was sighing so contentedly. I slipped out of bed and got dressed and joined the party. Hookah was being smoked and I was high as a kite and my balls were a helluva lot lighter then when I started the night. As I joined in on a few rounds of hookah and played ring of fire with an OE. The lights dimmed down and My vision slowly nodded off. My fellow party goers were passing out drunk around me. I couldnt help but walk off after most were out cold. Except nick and tom playing a vicious round of egyptian rat screw. I slip back into the room with her. I chop out another line.

Recently, I posted a brief summary of my likes and dislikes when it came to routes of administration for Heroin Base (No.3, to those who know) and, more importantly, my serious distaste for smoking, in spite of this being one of the most potentially efficient ways of consuming the base. 

I think, in retrospect, my aversion was the result of useless information online, advising me to either ""do it with a friend"" or ""use a toilet roll tube... balance a lighter"" in order to achieve a good vapour.

Here is how I smashed that ideal and got a totally awesome high from some UK street No.3

First, cut the top off a soda bottle (I used Pepsi, but I guess they're all the same right?) so you have the top and about 3 inches below it. 

Second, cut a small igloo-style entrance on one side of the bottle, like an upside down smiley face!

Third, attach a square of foil (dull side up) to the bottom, taping around the edges. What you should now have is half a soda bottle with foil taped to the bottom - with a sneaky little curved entrance.

Using the tip of a knife or some other useful implement, tip your desired dose just within the little doorway.

Exhale deeply, bring the bottle to your lips, form a seal. Make sure at this point to have the bottle at a very SLIGHT tilt (with the bump of base at the top of the incline, if you get me). Place the flame of a lighter approximately half an inch below the foil, chase the flowing oil downward, and inhale!

What I have managed to achieve here ladies and gents, is an EXCELLENT way to achieve a high smoking H without any hassle. I will, once I figure out how, attach an image of my little contraption.

I hope I have helped. Please let me know if any of you try it!

Need advice.,"I have been prescribed oxycodone IR 15mg for a long time for migraines. ive basically worked my way up from every drug out there, until finding opiates kill the pain.

I get very crippling migraines, they prevent me from functioning; i get them about every other day, but its never constant so i have always been prescribed on an ""as needed"" basis.

My doctor has randomly decided that i shouldnt be on THAT medication for migraines. understandable. unfortunately he has not offered me a replacement and refered me to a migraine specialist. basically tossed me overboard and told me to learn to swim.

The forms of treatment they offer are unsuccessful, unpleasant, expensive, dangerous, and experimental. getting injections in my head once a month is not an acceptable alternative to taking a pill whenever i need it.

their treatments only promise to reduce the frequency, so i still require treatment for the headaches when they come in full force.  They have cut my script from qt120 to qt10, and a few less every time i ask. its become such a pain in the ass to have to miss work to pick up a script for 6 pills. plus i have recently moved, so getting there is extra bothersome. The migraine doctor says its the GPs job to prescribe that stuff, while he focuses on preventative measures.



**TLDR:** Recently moved, have been getting prescribed oxycodone for years for chronic migraines ive had since i was a child.  doctors changed minds and are now only offering unacceptable treatment options, just because they feel ""uneasy"" about writing scripts for opiates. they are prematurely cutting my prescription before finding me an adequate replacement.

should i try a pain managment doctor? what would you do? what should i do? advice? suggestions?

I drank some water and walked it off and eventually it went away within 5 minutes. When I got home from work it happened again and keeps happening every hour or so. Again, I keep drinking water and I’ll walk around for a few minutes and then it goes away and I feel completely fine again.

Sorry about the throwaway. I am a lurker of this subreddit but am posting my question with a smurf account because people in real life know my main account and I don't want them to know I'm a user.

First, to give context, I am college-aged with no known health issues aside from a sensitivity to caffeine and stimulants.

Last night I was chasing the dragon with some decent BTH and was taking fat rips to try and get high quickly. I was about 1/3 of a point in when I decided to add some marijuana for the first time. Yes, the first time I have ever tried marijuana. I crumpled up a small amount and took 1 large hit with it, added a bit more dope, and took another midsized hit. This is when the problem started. I felt odd sitting up and needed to lie down.

My hands got cold and clammy, my heart started to burn, and my heart rate went through the roof, and I generally felt very odd. I felt confused and dizzy and just very out of it. Eventually my heart rate slowed and this is when things got scary. I could feel my body starting to fall asleep. You know how when you lie in bed at night, if you manage to stay awake you can experience the onset of sleep paralysis? It was like that; first my hands started to fall asleep, then my arms, then my shoulders. A similar phenomenon was happening in my legs. Also my jaw would start to go slack. This effects on my full body sensation were happening simultaneously. I would move my arms and legs around to try and get circulation going but I couldn't stop my body from falling asleep. Also it was very hard to form sentences or get my thoughts collected.

Meanwhile, my eyes were staring off into space. Sort of like when you nod or are very tired, you will find yourself staring and locking your vision. This would happen and if I let them, my eyes would close. As they closed I could feel very rapid REM movements (eyes moving right-left-right-left-etc.). As my eyes got fully closed, I could not breathe. I mean this in the literal sense. I would have to snap open my eyes so that I could continue breathing.

It felt like my body was going unconscious and my breathing was coming to an end. It was the most horrifying thing I have experienced. 

After about 45-60 minutes of this I felt a lot better. I managed to keep myself conscious and not pass out and die of respiratory failure. Then I got full body spasms and an elevated heart beat which was on/off for about 20 minutes before I recovered. I then took cautiously took a few more hits of BTH and ended up with a nice high and just fell asleep later.

What the hell happened? Why did I feel like I was about to pass out and die after smoking less than a point of BTH and weed? Has anyone experienced anything like this? Any insights? I posted this in Yahoo! answers and just got responses saying call 911 immediately but I am looking for someone who might know what I just went through.

TL;DR smoked less than a point of BTH and two hits of marijuana mixed in, then proceeded to very nearly go unconscious and (what felt like) die of respiratory failure. :-(

I recently tried H for the first time but not intravenously. I considered it, in fact I've considered it ever since I first read Junkie by William S. Burroughs, saw Trainspotting, Requiem for a Dream (despite the god-awfully tragic ending), and many other things that exposed me to the use of the drug (IV, particularly) and the seemingly absolutely blissful, high, best, words-can't-even-describe feeling. Anyways, despite trying every drug under the sun except for mescaline and those crazy, newer (I assume) chemically engineered hallucinogens like 2-TCB, I was a little nervous. I couldn't quite put my finger on exactly why I was nervous, probably multiple reasons. Apart from having the idea in my head that it was extremely powerful and fast-acting, I think I was mostly nervous about the potential long-term road I was about to get on. So I justified it by insufflating the nasty ass monkey water. Although I bought $100 worth, I decided to give it away today.

I usually take Roxy 30's, but I've stumbled across a bunch of these and I just wondered how y'all feel about them?

Anyway, are these gonna be worth my money? I obviously don't want to get something that isn't gonna be fun. Friends have told me they're like roxys on steroids, but their tollerance isn't as high as mine. I was wondering too if it would help any to take one of these and take a Roxy on top of it? Would that help at all or would it be a waste of pills? 
Also, I don't know much about time release, but I was wondering if it would make it stronger to take two 20's instead of a single 40? With a time release would it end up releasing more of the drug into my system by taking the two 20's? I don't know if this makes sense....I was just thinking if there's a certain amount released every hour, would the two 20's end up releasing more than a single 40?

We suffered in Berlin for twelve hours before heading to London. We had one day in London before going to the countryside for work meetings. As you can imagine, the thought of having important meetings after 48 hours without a fix was terrifying. Our one day in London was spent searching for heroin. 

We actually succeeded! We met a lovely war veteran who gave us some liquid methadone. Once he saw us use that and felt comfortable that we were not cops he took out his stash and shared some lines with us. 

The heroin in London is different than that in NYC. But we lucked out as from what we heard most people there inject and we snort, our new friend also used the olfactory method. The powder is more brown than tan or white and also grainier. It must be cut with something different than we are used to. 

I think after this trip we are going to have to start visiting /r/opiaterecovery. My first time in Europe and it has been dominated by trying to score heroin instead of sight-seeing. Our veteran friend gave us a few small bottles of the liquid methadone. I think when back in the US we will investigate how to use that to kick this.

So, I'm on Suboxone, as I've mentioned in other threads. I've been IVing it recently, and I'm being drug tested weekly. I used to assume they were using a simple 5-panel test, but today I realized that's not the case. My psychotherapist told me that they test the levels of both buprenorphine and its metabolites in my urine and that, much to their confusion, they didn't find the metabolite. So... Is that the result of IVing? Or is it because my sample was dilute? 

What is the difference in bupe metabolism between sublingual and IV? I've tried to research with little useful result. Any info would be appreciated. 

My therapist is operating under the belief that Suboxone cannot be IVed because of the naloxone. I'm certainly not going to correct this misinformation (she probably wouldn't believe me if I did, and it'd make me look pretty suspicious). But anyway, I'm just going to start taking it sublingually. It's not worth the stress just to get better BA. I'm interested to get your responses.

I've never been a morning person. So last night I performed a cold water extraction on 8 Vicodin 5's. Today I woke up to my cloudy mixture  chillin' in the fridge and noticed there was some stuff on the bottom of the glass. Well, me in my loopy morning mind decided that the stuff on the bottom is what I was after, and I used a turkey baster to suck out like 80% of the water before I was like... ""wait... Fuck"". Anyway, I'm not even mad about the vicodin because I have a bazillion of them, I'm mad at being an idiot. 

Fun Further Reading:


Around these parts, me and 2 other guys live off of one lady's prescription for Roxi 15's. She get's them twice a month, and what sucks is we end up selling them off to other people (for a profit), but running out of pills. So you might be thinking ""why don't you just not sell them?"" and you would be right, but if I don't, the other guys will. Well, at least one of them will, the other guy is my buddy, we work together to make sure neither of us run out of opiates. So basically, we have to sell as many as possible, to BUY as many as possible before the other guy buys them and we have nothing. I remember one time he bought the whole batch of 100, we had to send him a little message that that behavior was not gonna fly... but that's another story.

Also, fuck these guys who either charge 60 for a OP-60 (I would fucking quit before I paid those prices), or make you buy 10 of them @ $30ea or they won't sell. I hate OPs, I certainly don't want ten of them. I'm always in a constant battle with my own cheapness. I make really good money, but I hate paying for drugs, so I do little hustles, favors, and middleman shit to get high for free. Honestly, it probably costs me money anyway because I take up my time trying to grind out $50 here and there for drugs when I should be working lol. 

Last thought of the day: my circle of dopeheads is really fucking weird. They all chomp pills all day but they draw the line at heroin. I'm like ""it's the SAME thing!"" and they're all like ""No way man, I would never do that shit, NOT cool. You get addicted so fast."" blah blah blah, this coming from guys who can't get out of bed without throwing back 6 percocet. wtf ever, ok.

It wasn't supposed to be like this..,"Hi guys. I have been a long time lurker and share every tip and trade brought up in this forum with my boyfriend, who is also a user. I guess I felt it was my turn to speak. Here goes:

I have only been doing opiates for a year. Before opiates, I smoked pot pretty regularly. did coke with friends every other weekend. Tried my hand at some hallucinogens; but nothing compared to the first time I did something that rocked my world. And that was the Opana 40. My friends and I had went out drinking (yes I am since aware that was bad) and wanted to score some coke. Our dealer was out, but suggested we try the OP 40. IT was $60 at the time, so the three of us threw in 20, shaved it down. and split it. For the next 12 hours I felt like a complete zombie. I found myself stumbling down Ryan's neighborhood in his woolly ralph lauren robe. looking around at all the houses and thinking to myself. ""They have no idea that it could feel this good."" I felt sorry for them. After the midnight stroll was over, Ryan suggested I lay next to the hot tub, and I sat there thinking it felt as if a train were rushing next to me; that I could feel the breeze and the rumble of the tracks and it was comforting me. This train was inviting me inside to curl into a ball and take me away to my mamaws house. Far Far away, across every bump and curve to throw my right into my childhood bedroom. She lived right next to a train track, so when I used to spend the night with her, the sounds of the train put me to sleep while she lay in bed with me, smelling of ponds cold cream and rubbing my arms. Then, I woke up from this fantasy, and I puked. And i continued to puke for 12 hours. After I finally got my sorts together, i went home and googled what exactly I did. I had never done anything that strong, so no wonder the effect was so crazy. I told myself I would never touch one of those again. 

Fast forward a few months later, I met a guy from work that I immediately became attracted to. To my surprise, he seemed into me too. We started hanging out daily, but something wasn't right. I can be a bit observant, and I could tell he was lying to me about some things and often seemed sneaky. My gut reaction was another girl. Finally, he admitted to me that he had an opiate problem. The lying, sneakiness, strange behavior, was all a result of it. I felt like I had two options---to tell him to fuck off, I didn't need that baggage in my life. Or, accept that as the person he is. To offer him support and love and let him know he isn't a terrible person because he likes to get high. So, I chose the latter. And it wasn't that hard to do. My own dad has had a pill problem for as long as I can remember, and my mom stuck by him. 

After awhile, I started getting curious about his habit. I wanted to know what he liked to do, how it made him feel, how often he did it. At the time, he was mostly just a chipper. Lucky enough to have a connect that no one else knew, so was reaping from the cut outs from those buying through him. His drug of choice had been opana.  Eventually the prices of them skyrocketed up to $120, too high for us to afford (I was mostly footing his habit), and he switched to H. All of his friends were, and they said it was just as good, and cheaper. One day, he talked me into doing one some with him. I had had a terrible day, and he felt this would be all I'd need to forget about my worries. He knew about my past experiences with opiates and suggested I only try a little.This time it was the same wonderful feeling of being curled into a warm blanket and rocked to sleep. I still puked, but only once. But this time, puking felt amazing. Pretty soon, I wanted to do it again. And again.  I had my misgiving since I always wrongly assumed  H was just for junkies, but I gave in. That was last March and I have been doing it every day since.

Luckily, at the time, I worked a job that paid me quite well. I was looked up to as a role model at this job; a model employee. I gave off an impression of that as a goody-goody.  It was a rush to me to know that I had this secret life that know what knew about. That I was doing a line of Heroin before work, and sometimes on my lunch break, and no one ever knew.

But like all good things, this started to crash. My job became more demanding. It was hard to focus on important deadlines when alll I could think about my was next fix and how we were going to get it. I spent long lunch hours waiting waiting waiting on the dope dealer. One screw up after the next, landed me into termination. I lost the job I worked sooo hard to get. Shortly after, my bank account dwindled to nothing. 

I feel right now I am at rock bottom, and I need to quit. This week, we had no money. Not even anything to score a pack of cigarettes. I pawned my computer and my tablet just to get money for necessities and of course, those necessities turned into dope and then we were back to needing every day essentials again. Bills were behind and I can't lose my place. So, I did what I thought was best to do, and I came home to my parents. My bf was going to come with me, but then opted to stay last minute because an opportunity arose in which if he provided the transportation for a pickup, he would score a half G of H. He said he would try to get to me to bring me some so I wouldn't get sick while being here, but that didn't work out.

So, here I am, a few hours away from home. At my parents for the next few days. No opiates in sight. No hookup. No subs. And withdraws are kicking me HARD. It been about 42 hours since I last used. I am thankful that I do not have chills right now, I did earlier, but the restless legs and arms are making it nearly impossible to sleep. I took a couple of muscle relaxers and a nerve pill, and it seems to be helping to relax me, and get rid of cramps, but I wish I could just sleep. 

Not to mention the depression is driving me nuts. I have cried all day, and wished I was dead many of those times. I tell myself that is the withdrawals talking--that I do not want to kill myself. But with all the mess I am in, sometimes it seems like the best answer. 

It's just about 3 days of this, guys.  I can do this, right? Tomorrow will be day 2, and I hear that is the worst. I have limited resources to help ease the suffering, but any suggestions would be much appreciated. I keep telling myself, 3-4 days and you've done this--cold turkey practically.  But all I have on my mind is the $50 bucks I found stashed away in my wallet (I must have hid it in there when I Was messed up) and how once I go back home, I am getting myself a half G of this really good shit that just came into town and rewarding myself. 

Back in november, I did the same thing. I took a break from B, my bf, and ran off to my parents. I felt he was getting too out of control with it, and I was too. I was scared. I felt like losing the habit would also mean I would lose him. In a way, I am just as addicted to him as I am the drug. He called me once I left, telling me he loved me and that he would kick the habit along with me. I was here for 2 weeks, got myself clean and felt great. When I got back to our apartment, I saw the calendar he was using to mark an X across each day that he made it, not giving into H. Two weeks-same as me. We only made it one day before the two of us wanted to score together again. We told ourselves, we will do it right this time since we know We have the willpower to get clean---just an every now and then thing. Of course, that didn't happen. And we are back where we started only in a much worse position. Part of me knows that if I just broke things off with B, I could do this. But, I dont want to. 

So, I will sit here and try my best to suffer through this WD's and tell myself, you deserve this, you brought it on yourself. And anxiously count down the hours. And hope for sleep and comfort. So that 2 days from now, I will be clean. 

And go back home with the $50 and start all over again. :(

I picture it in my head today as my ""I have arrived"" moment equipped with a full band and balloons, and confetti. I knew that that was where I was supposed to be. I always hung out with an older crowd and my using quickly progressed within a few months. I started doing pills. And i was overwhelmingly happy. Opana, Percocet, Morphine, and Oxys became a way of life. One day my boyfriend had dope. I didn't know what this was, and was very confused because i thought dope was weed, and this sure didn't look like weed. However, he cant be blamed because I didn't ask questions. I was just along for the ride and i was truly in love with drugs so i knew whatever it was i would probably like it. I had gotten to the point where i'd pick up anything to get the next high. (pills, DMT, shrooms, inhalents, X, or spec. K) He knew I didn't really like uppers so he told me I would love it. I did it and it was the most amazing thing. I've tried  to explain the beauty of it to nonusers and did it no justice. I was 15 the first time i did heroin. Now 2 years later I am a junkie. I've managed to pull together 6 months through drug counseling (IOP), rehab (beginning of my senior year i spent 2 months), NA, and AA(NA is weak where i live so most addicts have to go to both.) I tried to kill myself a few months ago because I got so depressed (psychiatrist called it acute post withdrawal) and in my head i figured if i can't use heroin then there's no point in continuing my journey in this world.  I've never loved something so much in my life. It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Sometimes i swear i think i can taste it in the back of my throat after smoking a newport and it drives me crazy. Coming home to a crying mother and step dad, friends overdosing all around me, and withdrawal were not enough to keep me sober. To this day it still creeps into my brain on a daily basis. If youve never done it dont do it. Its like sex. Once you start having it you can't just stop. Your body wants it in a different way because you know what real good sex feels like. Its not just picturing or thinking or imagining. constant battle. Chances are i will use again because i love it so much. Just one more shot. Thats. All. I. Want.",1366168927.0

I've never gotten anything stronger than hydros, but I'm fine with that, as I really haven't ever needed anything, and was more than happy to get hydros.. When it first happened, I was getting 60 hydros every 2 weeks, I think for 4 weeks total. Then down to 30 every 2 weeks, which went on for quite awhile, before 1 time I called in and got a pretty annoyed response along the lines of ""fine, but this is the *last one*, ok?"" and I was supposed to get a surgery..

well I never got the surgery, then last week I fell skateboarding, and completely fucking dislocated the same shoulder. Back to the hospital where they reset it, and sent me home with nothing but ibuprofen. Called in complaining the next day and the ER gave me a small script for hydros, and then they sent me back to the same office as before.. and I knew they weren't going to be happy to see me, last time I saw them was when they gave me my ""last one"" [script] and me promising that I'd be getting a surgery that never happened.. Well, yeah, I got a lot of ""I told you so"", but the doctor I saw was a new one who I  hadn't seen before, and he saw that I was legitimately injured this time and I don't think he noticed that I had gotten so many scripts before, so he wrote me a small script of more hydros before giving me an MRI...

went back today to get my MRI results, and ended up seeing that nurse practitioner who had seen me so many times for scripts back when I first injured it, and right away I could tell he wasn't happy to be seeing me again.. He gave me a bit of greif about not getting the surgery over a year ago when he first told me to, gave me my results saying I tore my labrum in another spot, and now have some other defect or something... I dunno, its in the paper work.. I didn't even try for a script because I could tell by his tone and attitude he was already pissed to have to deal with me at all, and no way in hell he was giving me a script.

So then tonight, I called in figuring he wouldn't be in during the office's ""after hours care"", and complained that I had just fallen and my shoulder was in pain, and had just taken my last pain killer (they last scripted me a skimpy 20x5mg hydros a week ago, so I figured that was a pretty decent time to wait, and I've had plenty of H in the mean time).. receptionist actually says ""oh, you saw ____(nurse practitioner's name), he's still here, let me grab him"" and my heart sank... 

I knew he would recognize my name, and was waiting for him to come on the phone at any second to bitch me out or something... but, low and behold, the same woman comes back telling me ""caught him just on his way out... now, what did we have you on? I'll have him write it out and you can come pick it up"" 

now, I KNOW I'm pressing my luck. I *know* that at the very least, the nurse practitioner knows I'm a drug user, and he's the one writing pretty much all the scripts.. not sure if its marked on my file over there, or if its just that one guy who has taken a mental note of it... 

anyway, what should I do? Should I just aboslutely not try for another one? Should I keep complaining, as since my last injury, I am in legit pain [but have mainly been using H and other illicit pain killers to help me, as my tolerance requires me to eat the whole hydro script in 1-2 doses, more or less.. or sell it for H]... blah blah.. rambling on. I'm really hoping I'm not walking into an ambush when I go pick up with script.

also, if I am flagged as a drug seeker at this one office, will that carry over to other places? I'm not really sure how any of that works.. I just know I've had probably well over 300x5mg hydro prescribed for this injury, and probably only ever needed ~30 of them during the worst of my pain... I'm really amazed I've been able to push this so far.",1366148906.0

Then I get frustrated, pick up a sack, and get well without getting high because I have bupe bound to my receptors.

So why is it that I still get well after I take suboxone? Is it because bupe is a kappa opioid receptor partial agonist and doesn't bind to those receptors as well as the mu opioid receptors (resulting in my inability to feel ""high"" after I dose)? Does anyone else have this problem with bupe?

I've been on suboxone lately and on/off for a long time.

Long ago, in my ""I'll do anything but shoot up"" days I tried oral/nasal morphine and decided it was pointless. Well, tonight I was offered 2 90mg Avinza ER capsules for for 30 and, because I IV now and H is 20 dollars for a pretty light bag of mediocre shit around here, I decided to go for it. 

So I pop one open, grind up about 75mg of the balls and dissolve them in cool water and filter it into a syringe and get ready to shoot. For the record, it takes me 2 bags of lowish-moderate quality dope (something like 50-60mg) to catch a decent buzz, 3 to really get floored by the rush. And I've been taking minimal doses of suboxone for weeks, so my tolerance is probably a little lower. 

Important detail: I did not wait long enough after my last sub dose and the majority of the euphoria was blocked. This is very relevant to my question.

So anyway, I lay back, tie off, and shoot the shit. Seconds pass and I concentrate on my bodily sensations, anticipating warmth and contentedness, and curious about the ""weird"" or ""unique"" rush I've heard described. 

The moment it hits me I leap up off the bed, because it does NOT feel good. It's not the same sensation, but the sudden antithetical, dysphoric, unexpected effect reminds me of shooting up suboxone after full agonists and getting the agony of injection precipitated withdrawal. I immediately get the pins and needles, which I was expecting, but they are INTENSE. It feels like fucking daggers, not pins. And my heart is racing. My hands are red and... Not swollen per se, but they look plump from the sudden boost in my blood pressure. I lay down and start to control my breathing to calm myself down, knowing it'll probably subside pretty quickly. It does, after a minute or so, and I'm left nauseated and slightly tired feeling. 

Now, obviously the euphoria and pleasure were absent because my suboxone blocked all the desirable effects, but my question is why the negatives (pins/needles and blood pressure effects) were so powerful?? Was 70-75mg IV too much for me? I thought I calculated based on my H dosage pretty accurately, but I guess if the H around here is cut to shit it could've just been a very high dose that didn't feel like a very high dose because of the blocking. My guess is that the suboxone didn't block the histamine or vasodilation effects, but blocked the opioid agonism, and that my dose was very high because of my lowered tolerance, thereby leaving me highly uncomfortable and eventually nauseated. But are the pins and needles effects usually so extreme and I'm just a pussy? lol. It was MUCH more extreme than anything I've ever felt from a limb falling asleep and strong enough that I got a little worried, briefly. Is that common with high doses?

PS, I just finished off the 90mg capsule and this last shot left me feeling pretty good. More opiated and this 15mg one didn't feel overly intense or cause a severe histamine reaction. Once I wait out the Suboxone blocking I'll probably start with a 30-40mg shot because the 70mg wasn't worth the extreme pins and needles.

Thanks for your explanations.",1366248601.0

He was always a nice kid even tho he had the worst case of drug dealer time ever (one time his version of an hour was 4 days, by the time he got back to me i was already through the worst of my detox) so i was genuinely worried about him. also, he would always front me buns if i was broke, he would also front me whatever other drugs i wanted so i could make some cash which would obviously just go to him for more D.  So he calls me up and i immediately recognize his voice. He asks how im doing and says that hes good and if i was still interested that he could come by later.  I tell him I am obviously still interested but i am also broke to which he responds ""Its cool bro, you dont have to pay this time, ill come meet you at your place at 11 at the latest.""  So 11 rolls around and no word, 12 rolls around and he says ""sorry man just got home. ill be there in an hour."" 1 rolls around no word, 2 rolls around and he texts ""sorry bro i cant get a ride ill have to see you in the AM."" and now i realize its business as usual with this kid and i write it off and just try and forget about it.  Morning comes and im feeling soaked in detox dew and then at noon i get a call from him asking if im around.  I obviously jump for joy and go and meet him.  And as he goes in for the covert hand-off bro hug he passes this baggie off to me (imgur link below).  Upon initial covert inspection i thought that he accidentally gave me a 20$ of girl but i hurry off to try and find a public bathroom to make sure.  I find one and open up the bag to the wonderful smell of the strongest vinegar smell iv ever smelled from D.  I was ecstatic, having always been a connoisseur of the east coast stamp trade, rocked dope is something iv never ever seen in person before.  I did about half of it immediately and got a light buzz going.  Once i got home i did the rest and got real nice. I was surprised that i wasn't totally wrecked but still it was definitely a cleaner buzz than most of the stamps we have in BK. the link for the picture is below.

TL:DR dealer calls me after radio silence or 2 years and lays a nice little present on me for free. ""First Ones Always Free.""

I take opiates for pain, not to get high, but tolerance is just as important a factor, and thus I need to manage it. I'm currently taking a break, I'm maybe 5 or 6 days in, not sure cause I've lost track. actually, no.. I'm closer to 10 days in, 5 or 6 days ago I took a tramadol though and had zero effect at all. I'm only taking tramadol atm btw too, so I wouldn't think tolerance would be as big of a factor, but it seems it might be. I took one today as I'm doing some yard work and I can feel it this time, but there's still quite a tolerance which encouraged me to go do some reading.

It seems a lot of people are saying you can quit H for years and within a few days of using be right back where you were. Is this due to memory or tolerance? The only other drug I've used on a long term basis to notice the effects of tolerance is marijuana and it's kinda the same, but based on my experience I'm lead to believe it's memory based. When I take a 6+ month break from pot my tolerance is definitely reset to 0, I can, and often do, smoke day in and day out and thus it gets right back to where I was within a couple weeks, but I've also actually metered my pace and was able to sustain the nice low tolerance for months. So what's your experience, or thoughts on this? How do you manage tolerance? Btw so far I have taken 2 tolerance breaks, I take a break whenever I notice my tolerance increasing significantly, but i have noticed diminishing returns, albeit nothing crazy, over time, but maybe I just need a longer tolerance break.

I'm paranoid that I am going to inject into an artery, and I'm not sure if everything that bulges out is a vein or not, and if not, how can I tell which is an artery?

Thanks 

EDIT: also, what I do now is: Register the vein, start injecting, about half way through the shot I pull back slightly again to check if I'm still in the vein (make sure I still see blood), then finish the shot, then, before I remove the needle, I'll check one last time and pull back a bit to make sure I still see blood, and didn't miss any of the shot, then remove the needle...

Is this unhealthy? Is there a better way to do it?",1366377944.0

I have been doing opiates for about 4 years now, I experimented with it at the beginning of my college career and I fell in love with the feeling since.

One of the bigger, longer veins in my forearm, the one that wraps around the back of the forarm, starts at around the elbow and ends at the wrist (not the ones in the crux of your elbow), has become pretty firm basically the whole way along my forearm.  I can feel the pressure when i press on it really hard.  I IV'd into it probably two or more weeks ago maybe three times total, at different spots along the vein.  It hasn't softened back up so I'm starting to worry that there is a clot or something in there.  At first I thought it was normal but im starting to think it's not since it hasn't gone back to normal yet.  I started applying massage type pressure along the vein today and plan on continuing to do so.  There is no brusing, and it is mildly tender along the vein.  I realize that there are medical conditions with these symptoms, however I wanted to know if anybody else has experienced this problem where the vein eventually went back to normal again.  Should I try doing some forearm exercises, or would it be worth it to check into the doctor and reveal that I have injected illicit substances into my arm and the vein is firmed up.

(x/post from /r/Drugs),"I'm looking to perform a CWE for the first time and have already reviewed several thorough walkthroughs on the procedure. One of the most important things mentioned is to not allow the mixture to start freezing during the step that it must be placed in the freezer to aid in the separation of the APAP from the desired product. However, none of fhe guides gave suggestions on how to make sure that does not happen.

Does anyone have a rough time estimate on how long I should allow the mixture to sit in the freezer, or any other tips to avoid screwing up this step?

Some people that I've heard of that wont buy it if its not stamped. I don't get that. I used to get stuff that was always stamped, but that guy I've been getting from for a while now, I suppose got lazy and stopped stamping his bags. Also what I was thinking if he uses the same stamp all the time, things could become ""Hot"" with the cops or what-not. But who knows..? For all the people who think if its not stamped, its not good, that's not the case in this situation. Like I said before, this is some of the best H I've had in a long time.

I legitimately want to stop my dope binges. One of these days I'm going to do too much, and I'd be fine with dying but with my luck I would live and have to suffer the consequences of yet another overdose. I want to have money for other things. I want to move on with my life. 

Is suboxone meant for people like me? Or is it for users with a more consistent habit? Am i going to get hooked on it like my boyfriend is? 

I just want to generate some discussion about subs, anything really. I rarely read this board because i hate how people treat opiates so whimsically. Im heroins bitch and it's driving me to constant suicidal thoughts.

Here's why:,"Alright. I'll make this brief. I'm hooked on heroin - NYC quality - not amazing but not too bad. I am doing about 10-20 bags a day. More recently since I have the money. 

I just got out of rehab one month ago for H and quit and was sober for about 20 days before I relapsed. I have a loved one visiting in a little more than 2 weeks and I work Mon-Fri which I travel to Connecticut for (I live in NYC).

I need to quit. The withdrawal symptoms are the problem. When they kick in and are bad, they are BAD. I am all out of suboxone/etc. so it's going to be cold turkey save for the tips I read on the sidebar that include Immodium, DXM, Gatorade, etc. I will try anything. I also hear Kratom Tea works well but don't know where to get Kratom - can anyone attest to this?

Any tips would be welcome. I need a GAME PLAN. Since I basically can't take off work (I was out for 3 weeks and admitted to them I was going to rehab for substance abuse), I figure I should do my last shot of H on a Thursday evening. This way, I can manage to get through my work day on Friday and by the time I get home, the sickness will be kicking in. I can then sleep all evening and into Saturday. Saturday will be hell and I plan on just spending all day in bed, taking the immodium, etc. and just getting through it. Sunday will suck as well but I hope that by Monday morning, I have enough energy, etc. to get to work and will have kicked it by then.

Please, /r/opiates. I should have never relapsed but with this person visiting in 2 weeks and money beginning to run out, I need to stop. I have to. A gameplan of any sort would help. Also - do you think a three day methadone program would be good? I know that methadone withdrawal is a bitch but I hear that's more of the 30-day/3-month programs. I figure 3 days of taking and tapering off methadone might work.

TL;DR: Need to quit heroin in the next 2 weeks, can't take off work, would like to do it on a Thurs-Sunday. Need help/advice/gameplan.",1366671941.0

The doc switched me over to oxycodone temporarily, to see how I handle narcotics, with the plan of putting me on 1ce a day dilaudid if I handle them ok. 

Anyway, the day he said he was switching me he had me sign one of those ""pain management contracts,"" you know the deal.  Dirty pee = no more help from them.  I figured he'd test me the next time I came in, but low and behold it was a same day test.  I'd been smoking 1ce or 2ce a week for awhile, and smoked 4 days before the test, so I know I've failed.

Each fold contained a miniscule amount of fine tan powder with a bitter taste familiar only to those who've walked the line before; myself included. It hadn't taken much to acquire; a couple phone calls and an arrangement to reimburse myself with tonights wasted funds through a mundane transaction tomorrow evening, effectively neutralizing my only reservations and rationalizations on why not to participate in such a purchase.


In the past such an acquisition usually took hours, a lot of waiting and unanswered phone calls; hour long trips to dangerous poverty stricken areas, carrying such a reputation that simply driving through town was enough to warrant what the police described as a ""wandering ticket."" But not this time, no, this time it took something like 12 minutes and a mile drive from my home in what some might consider the ""ghetto"" to the local shopping center just the next town over. And now, back at home, I took a moment to admire the tiny packets now resting atop my dresser.


Warm with anticipation, I exhaled a deep breath and tore open one of the folds, emptying its contents upon a worn Nirvana concert DVD case, The meager pile exhumed from the packet was quickly shaped with an equally decrepit debit card into a neat line, about an inch in length. A straw cut into a third was retrieved from my sock drawer, placed in one nostril as the opposite hands index finger effectively plugged the other. From there it was as simple as a deep breath before taking a step back and lowering myself to the refuge of my bed.


Within several quick moments the effects began to take hold, the nerves in my face and eye sockets apparently converted to perceiving a new threshold of gravity, a heavy yet blissful weight pulling upon my features. A very specific and unique warmth spread along my body, as if my veins now carried along them a very sincere and tingle inducing sense of security. Ascending to my feet, I allowed myself the most satisfied of grimaces as I paused to glance in the mirror on my way out, closing the door behind me.


Returning downstairs to my recliner and 50 inch television, I poured a can of Coke into a glass of ice as I flickered through the channels, relinquishing the remote once I'd found something familiar. After lighting a cigarette I closed my eyes and smiled once more to myself. For good or ill, I knew I was home.

My hands have always been my indicator for me, when I first feel the high coming on I usually feel it in my fingertips first, spreading through my arms, caressing itself through my shoulders, and finally slithering to my back. Then I can feel it; the eternal bliss, the sudden chill you get when you can feel it coursing through your body, the aches and pains from last night, from last week, shit, the pain from my whole life...its gone... a couple pills later and its all gone.


Why can't i feel like this all the time, do some people feel like this all the time? is it even possible to feel this good without these drugs. I begin to think that sooner or later the only happiness in my life will come from powders, pills, prescriptions, and pussy (not that im even getting any in the moment)..........""Fuck, im late to class""


I stumble from the warm safe haven of my bed and crawl to the floor like that of a slug on its deathbed. In this moment I have the same thought that has reoccurred to me ever since I took down these compounds for the first time ""If I could, I would sit here in this exact state of feeling, this exact state of emotion, and this exact state of life until the day I die....and i would be happy"" But the thing that trips me up the most is that EVERYTHING, and let me repeat *EVERYTHING* is ok when I can feel it starting in my fingertips. 


My childhood of not seeing my parents, my mom smoking crack, and being an alcoholic her whole life, all those years of being fucked with in school for being the fat kid that would go nowhere in life, all these scars on my wrists from the countless times I used to cut myself and wanted to see how deep the vein was, hoping I would accidentally nick it and end my sorry life, all those years spent in psychiatrist offices ""You suffer from what we call severe depression, ADHD, social anxiety, and in other words you are fucked up"", all those years of being a kid and locking myself in my room to just cry for hours......none of that matters anymore. I begin to feel it in my fingertips.

But is this how my life was supposed to be, was I supposed to cut too deep, am I still supposed to be depressed, should I not be the first person in my family to go to college. Am I cheating myself for the better or worse. Is that feeling in my fingertips saving my life or simply prolonging my imminent fall into my own demise. It is crawling up my arms


its now 11:30....I take another pill. I say to myself ""it doesnt matter anyway, because if I died at this moment, I would be happy, all the pain is gone""

I recently had a shot prepped for my vein, but I registered, then lost the vein (I don't IV often). I was worried about the blood coagulating in the rig since I had drawn a decent amount of blood into it accidentally when registering(probably 50% blood, 50% water). After looking at the coagulating blood, I decided that was definitely not a good idea to inject it back into me, so I squirted it into an oral syringe, and watered it down a bit, then sniffed the bloody solution (I know, pretty fucking gross.. but I'm a fiend and I'm not gunna waste a perfectly good bag.. and I've gotten bloody noses before so it wasn't anything new)..

Ended up getting me muchhhhh higher than the bag would have if I had just sniffed it.. like, 1.5 times as high.

Then, this morning I tried again, but with just straight water this time. Bag of dope, mixed in water, into oral syringe, up the nose, hang head upside down over bead for ~3 minutes and let that shit soak into my sinuses... I swear, I wouldn't have even felt this bag if I had normally sniffed it, but I've got a decent buzz going..

I'm pretty convinced that sniffing opiates in solution lets them get absorbed much better than sniffing powder... which makes sense. Consider all modern drugs taken up the nose (medicinally): no one is sniffing powder, its all nasal solutions.. I figure there's probably a reason..

plus, if you mix up a bunch of H and water in an afrin bottle for the day, you could sniff anywhere all day, and no one would know (just looks like you're using your nasal spray)... (be aware that h in water degrades to morphine, so you couldn't keep the solution around for very long without your H turning into morphine)",1366990038.0

I'm the guy smoking the cigarette out front of Kwik(Quick)Shop at 2am, waiting on friends, another schmo -- The sky is clearer then, the mayhem ceases and you only hear your tobacco-burning crisply rustle, a quiet pleasure I wouldn't think twice to enjoy.

The road is a bleasure mist: cars roll by and I'm none the wiser: a car's a car.

And in every car is another stooge, another schmo, another reason to shrug grimly in the night and look away from yourself. But as every schmo noes: ""There's a stooge, I'm a stooge, we're a stooge.""

**********

Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

People stopping staring
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Thru' the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes

Banking off of the north east wind
Sailing on a summer breeze
And skipping over the ocean like a stone

I won't let you leave my love behind
No I won't let you leave
I won't let you leave my love behind
I won't let you leave

""Lately, Waldo...""

Funk, pure funk. It's when you're pissing at midnight in a filthy bathroom and all of a sudden there's that left-shoulder chill-thrill: it starts right at the base of the spine, and you feel the day's roses and skulls crawl bone by bone, a fleeting glimpse into the abyss of Past. That's what shudders me most: creeping snapshots lying alone in a forgotten folder on the bottom floor of my brain, below the basement and under the sewer, waiting for their one brief moment to shine and appear before my wonderstruck eyes OH sudden urge grabit it OKAY safe under cloth and smoke.

**********

All my acquaintences, poor & dim-eyed sitting in a massive circle, so that the only person's face I can't recognize is the one exactly acrost from me, probably a doppelganger and thus me. That's how big the circle is, I mean I can see for miles now, and everyone I've ever met is there waiting on arms and legs for my big pluff of a word. It's white outside of this, and only two or three characters lurk in my unchangeable peripheral. They know why we sit here pittering endlessly, and we know that they know so we just keep guessing at what those people know. I finally catch one of the shade's attention and

**********

Severed lamp-shade shading strictly floor (pretty vain of the floor), books, bags, shirts, shoes, notes and essays, trash and music. My days are littered there amongst my belongings. Each night I finally unmask and discard another little day: it lightly flutters back and forth down on top of the last day, ever so delicately, like a feather of course you're thinking, but this is a mechanically forced flutter, it mimics a clock but it has no markings: it's simply a reminder of time's unconditionally loving hold on me.

**********

The lightbulb's there, too — somehow above the shade, remarkably (pretty vain of the bulb), awaiting the crowning that will never come. He is spent: knocked over in a drunken night moment that passed before it could be remembert.

**********

DAMN the timing is immaculate, and now I'm going uphill, nonchalant & brisk gestures flashing, fleshing themselves out before me. Changing sideways stranger, stealing and moving it all along for pleasure's sake. Peddling moments across the screen, my screen -- my little man up there between the eyes picking out the reels, a long ever-expanding/can't-find-the-Z's-section behemoth of a bookshelf: bookshelves on bookshelves. He picks the book or the reel or the tune and shoves it on in and I jump/jive/run/dive/try/feel/cry/limp across the finish line.

**********

But it's all too much: I need peace, peace from that ear-splitting dialogue of the day. I love the people and the words and when it comes down to it I really fear myself, and all the people in the world won't pry me from that safe corner. It will take a steady hand without a cigarette.

Baby be good

The Drone attracts me because I want the Stability. The queen's demands are simple enough (if only ""have you listened to this? ohhh listen to it"").

**********

""Freak out for another day"" indeed did Iggy nail the fucker on the swollen head. I'm amazed lookin back on all the days and weeks and years - not many - each day was ecstatic and shriveling horrific yet they mush together like glue. The gun blasts and the radio does play, you're sitting there listening, nearly shivering at the quelled joy, and he SCREAMS through your radiator & rotted-muffler & blasted-A/C & blustering-cracked-window, THROUGH your stagnant mind, leaving blissful shattered glass between every eye-lash.

**********

But it's just another night, all the usual cats and dogs, nothin' 'spicious. 'til Frank rolls around, then you've gotta hold it in and not act so tough, play the game and hope he doesn't waste you. All of a sudden your life is worth quite a bit, you look at it in your hand like a shriveled buck and a dime and two pennies: pathetic, but all you've got. Talk back, take the ultimate risk and see what everyone's (not) talking about.

**********

And the headache jus' keeps rollin'. After the first few days you start to forget about it -- but that makes the remembering times all the more wincing. Then you're fightin' the headache for all it's (you're) worth, just hoping that when 5 'o' clock rolls around YOU'RE on top of HIM.

**********

You run into a stooge and you say something sly, walk away and kinda chuckle at your cleverness (""man, he's got years to go, still..""). Turn the corner and WHAM it's all a little different. You're dizzy, and there's blood between the fingers you didn't realize were clutching your just-as-new wound below the belly-button. A sleazy stooge laughs (maybe the same stooge, probably the same stooge) and you hesitate at first, but start to laugh also, laughing with him, at your own hilarious little last-minute realization. You share your last minute with this stooge: he has no tears in his eyes, no lip quivering in shock; he's just looking and knowing that he's about to turn that same corner.

**********


And now I'll go occupy the sleazy little grease-corner, doze against one wall or the other and hope to dream, hope to remember my dream, so upon returning to the now new & forgotten world (my old & familiar world), I'm refreshed. Sometimes hope is all you have to hold on to.

They weren't going to lay charges as the amount in there was so tiny (a syringe and crack pipe ready to go and paraphernalia). Then police leave, Dad freaks, calls my counselor. Counselor recommends detox. I say I just need to sleep.

I go to bed and start to IV Ketamine of which I had a solid 3.5g maybe more. Dad comes back and says we're leaving for detox gotta be there in an hour.

Usually 50 - 100mg excellent quality SR #4 and a few glasses of red wine. I only snort. I occasionally go a little too far, and with smoking too many cigs throw my guts. 

I have also been messing around with diazepam, 10 - 20mgs with a couple of drinks. 

Now im aware its a big risk - its combining 3 CNS depressants. However, if I stay at between 5 - 10mg of the diazepam, plus my usual small dose of #4 and a few glasses of wine, I dont see this as anywhere near extreme? And it has to really help with the sweet sweet nods! 

Am I been too naive here? At these doses, with a bit of sanity applied, I cant see it been that risky!

And i was wondering if any one has used it on blotter, and would you take it like you would with cutting a fent patch and putting it on your gums and or 2ci etc? 


I'm interested because it would be nice, to use an Opiate that is actually stronger then the Methadone i'm on and actually get a nice high from it, and i figured That because it's Blotter paper it would be really hard to pick up. As if i was to go ahead and order some I would be getting it sent from the UK to Australia.


Rather then having a shot of dope, and feeling the rush and 15 minutes later, i felt like i didn't have anything. And I figured the best thing would to be A) Try find  a source for methadone (Par, from me dosing each day.) or B) Find something that's stronger, thus the fent. In saying that, has any one had experience with taking fent on top of your 'done and how was the high? Obviously with precaution and safety in mind. 


So any advice to the things I've mentioned would be great! :)

In my personal experience, I have been addicted to OC40's and OC80's about 3-4 years ago (at the start of my college career) and after OC80's pretty much disappeared, I have been getting into 30's a lot. I pick up almost once a day, but it doesn't deter me at all from school.

I will be graduating this May, as a double major in Computer Science and Math and I feel like I was only able to get through my semesters because of opiates. For me, opiates gave me that passion and drive to do well in my studies. 

Note: I used to do about 3-4, OC30's a day but now I calmed myself down and I've been only doing about 1-2 a day. I was tired of unreliable dealers and withdrawals. ",1367035240.0

Even after having read [This](http://www.fiercepharma.com/story/oxycontin-patent-expires-tuesday-fda-under-pressure-stall-generics/2013-04-15) days before. I pay and get to the car to pop one and I see the blue pills instead if the orange ones. I look at the bottle and sure enough they're 30's IR. I go back inside and tell them they had made a mistake but she shows me the prescription and he had written Oxy IR. His office is 2 hours away so I can't just go and tell them but I'm not gonna call and complain either because I do need pain relief and I don't want them to tell me to dispose of them or anything dumb like that. I take one day off of work a month just to see my doctor so now I have to wait till next month. 

I do prefer the OP's instead of IR for the record. I'm not complaining, even though I do have a preference, but I just figured I would give some context before I go to sleep and leave any questions unanswered for a long time.

* Get a dremel. Put duct tape around the holes where air comes out when you run it. put a fine grinding bit on. Cone shaped preferred.

* Next: Take your Opana and grab it with needle-nose pliers.
set up a glass plate with a piece of paper folded over it like an envelope. Put the pill in there(gripped by the pliers) and grind that sucker into a fine powder. Take your time. be tedious.

* Collect all the powder and scrape it into a powder. Microwave for 8 minutes.     
    
***MAKE SURE ITS A GLASS MICROWAVABLE PLATE WITH A GOOD MICROWAVE.***

* take that goo and scoop it with a spoon into a ball on the spoon and throw it in the freezer. Let harden for 10 minutes or so.

* Now take that hardened ball. should be a blackish tan gooey thing. grip it with the needle noses and repeat the grinding step onto the plate.

So I'm thinking of drying it in the oven and smoking it. It's absolutely soaked. It was my morning dose too. Anybody know a better way to deal with this, perhaps one that won't prevent me from keeping it overnight?

Edit: bought some pills today and I'm alright, just down a significant amount of money. I ended up smoking it. It was about half a gram by my estimation. I ended up letting it sit and dry a bit and scraped the portion that wasn't utterly sucked up by the paper (which I assume had most of the active constituents in it- that sucked) and made it into a tiny ball. Popped it on some foil and went to town. I got quite a hit out of it, I think it was condensed a bit by the whole thing.

Well now that I'm older and use drugs, I have always wondered what the hyper about opiates is about. I'm just scared to try them incase my reaction to codeine would be similar with other opiates. I don't want to ask my doctor this question because it would seem sketchy.

I am usually a Heroin and Oxycodone user. In the past, I have used Oxymorphone, Hydrocodone etc when I could/had to. Lately, however, I have picked up a habit of using Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) exclusively. I hadn't used in a few months before  this most recent habit started and it has been going for a bit over a month. Also, I am an IV user and really only use 16-32mgs a day, depending on how lucky I am. I have also been living in my truck, so my cleanliness has been lacking and I have had to make one rig last a while. I did also share a needle with one person for a few days. Most of the time, if I do shoot of Dilaudid, the symptoms start to appear around 8-10 hours later.

Either way, starting about five or so days ago, I got what seemed like cotton  fever, it eventually went away- as it usually does. What I found odd though is that the symptoms were returning without me using anything. I will get extremely fatigued, get a low fever, intense headache, uncomfortable nerves, chills, and SERIOUS sweating. It comes and goes and I have experienced it 2-3 times a day, I take a nap, sweat BUCKETS, but after the nap/sleep, I generally feel better. 

After two days of this, I went to the ER and told them everything I had been doing and what my symptoms were and they ran every test they could minus checking me for STDs (they apparently dont do that at this particular ER) and suggested that I go get myself screened for HIV. They didnt find anything wrong with me but we are still awaiting the results on some of blood work.

I have read the symptoms of early HIV infection and am worried as I have many of them, but have to wait until Monday, when the free screening clinic is open. But, theres also the hope that it could be something not as bad that we will find out with the final results of the blood tests. There is also the possibility that this is just a particular withdrawal that I have never experienced.

So I guess my questions are:

Do different opiates have different feeling  withdrawals if they are used exclusively?

Are these symptoms (severe night sweats, reoccuring/fleeting fever,  headache, aches, severe chills) enough to validate my fear that I may have contracted HIV by sharing that needle?

Are these symptoms something that might indicate a blood bourne illness (from all of that time of using less than ideal tools) that would only show up for the doctors after time?

Finally, if you dont have anything to say besides that I am and idiot because I shared or reused needles several times, save it. I know I acted stupidly. I am not posting this to be treated like an idiot. If you have, however, experienced something similar and/or have some insight, I would really be grateful to get some input.",1367114984.0

Fell into a stash from a dead family member, got some safety questions (hydro/homatropine)","So I was recently helping clean up a family members house who just died after being moved to the VA cause they' were dying of lung cancer and need 24/7 assistance, and they were told not to bring any of their old meds with them as new ones would be supplied. Said family member left behind a bottle of Hycodan 5/1.5 and i was wondering if anyone's had any experience getting high with this as the homatropine is an anticholinergic. From what ive read the dose present is sub-therapudic and thus shouldn't do much but i would need to take at least 20mg of hydrocodone for any worthwhile effect. As a side note, he also had a vial (30ml) of 100mg/5ml morphine sulfate that you guys love so much, so supplementing the morphine with hydrocodone is definitely an option. Unrelated, but for someone who doesnt spike is it better to take the liquid morphine sublingually, orally, or nasally? The liquid came with a .1ml increment syringe for dosing with so i can stick any amount i want to measure out anywhere i want, and i'm unopposed to sticking it in unconventional places as well if it can stretch my supply. My tolerance is currently very low but tends to jump up rapidly due to past useage so i wanna get the most bang for my buck with what I have before I get more of the 30mg XRs very soon.

i've been following this sub for a long time now and finally the moment for me is here to write a post myself. please excuse my not so perfect english as i am from austria, europe.

so i have a, let's say, 5 years opiate history, beeing on and off. always heroin, nothing else. i only smoke it (when i get the good stuff to smoke), and usually i snort it.

in the last 2-3 weeks my habit got pretty serious once again, me needing my 'medicine' every day just to fulfill the daily business (i am a student and besides have 2 jobs, partially also to support my habit) and get through the day. to get through the day i would need 1 line in the morning, one at lunchtime, and one at aroung 4-5pm, this is about half a bag if i am very economically. 1 bag is usually about 0.7-8g heroin.

so of course i am mad at myself for developing a habit again when there is too much to do and i don't have enough time (4-5 days in a row without anything to do) to go through withdrawal.

but okay, we all know how things are going with opiates/heroin, it's just too good a feeling etc....
the heroin i buy for me is average street heroin i guess, not strong, but no shit either. enough to make you seriously addicted. also because i can call my dealer whenever i want and get my next bags. a few times i also bought h from the silkroad and this shit is insane of course, you can't compare it to what i get. so just to give you an impression of the quality. and as mentioned, i always snort it, never shot it (and i will keep it that way, can't trust myself).

whatever, now as my addiction is really interfering with my daily life (study, girlfriend, work, family, friends, MONEY) again, i wanna kick it, but i saw no opportunity because i only have one day off on sunday, that's not enough for withdrawal, which is, as mentioned, usually 4-5 days for me to feel perfectly well again. but still, i hate it and i just can't do anything productive/good during this hellish time. so i was pretty desperate when i was thinking about my situation during waiting for my dealer to arrive. but then something happened: my guy came and gave me, additionally to the bags i bought, 1 bag of cocaine (he sometimes does this, i always love it) and, here it comes, four subutex 8mg pills. subutex is buphrenorphine, as you may know. 8mg is the strongest pill, you have to take it sublingually as it has a shitty bio-availibility if you swallow it.

so now i see these four pills of bupe as my chance to escape my addiction once again. of course i know 8mg at once will be much too strong for me, but this leads me to my question:

how much of one pill (8mg) do you think i have to dose? once per day? once in 2 days? i only have 4 pills, so how reduce my dose to have minimum withdrawal at the end? crush the pills, snort it, or take it sublingually?

I have bone spurs in my neck which give me pain from time to time but doesn't warrant oxy TBH.

I was only expecting panadeine forte (30mg codeine, 500mg acetaminophen) but this doc skipped past that and offered oxy without my asking. After I ran out, I asked my normal doc for more and he look horrified that this other doc had given them to me, he also refused to give me any. My reg doc is looking out for me but sometimes a mother fucker just wants to get high so I went back to the other doc and got more oxy.

I've been back to this other medical centre numerous times, hamming it up about how my neck is so painful. Last time, the doctor suggested cortisone injections into my neck. I sat there thinking oh fuck what have I got myself into, this dodgy fucker wants to stick me with needles and all I want to do is get high. If he tries to do it right now, I'm gonna have to refuse but it's going to look hella dodgy because apparently I'm in so much pain! Thankfully, he just gave me a referral to a neuro. Obviously I didn't call to book an appointment because I don't need no fucking injections into my neck.

The problem I have now is the prescriptions don't last long enough. I started in Jan with 5mg taken orally, that then turned into chewing 5mg, then 10mg, then 15mg and now 20mg.

This whole thing was an accident, I never wanted it to happen, they were all placed in front of me like I didn't have a choice. A month supply of oblong white pills. I examined the label ""7.5/325mg hydrocodone and APAP.....quantity 60.....take 2 a day "" it was only supposed to be 14 pills, the doctor must of made a mistake when writing the script.

I never wanted it to happen, I never was curious about opiates, I smoked weed, that was enough for me, the second I became curious was when they were placed in front of me, the accident of a young dentist assistant gave me 60 white oblong pills compressed with fillers and euphoria. The next day after the surgery. I didn't have a choice.

The medicine they gave me to put me under was wearing off, I don't even remember getting home. my dad drove me and later told me that my jumbled words mimicked those of someone from a tribal descent. I started to feel the pain. Fuck this shit hurts. 

""Take this, it will help""

After the script ran out, finding more of these white oblong pills of euphoria wasn't hard.

For all things holy in the world I still can hear my father saying this in the back of my head sometimes. Echoing much like how words bounce off walls and mountains restating back to you what was said only seconds before.

Every time I take a pill, every time a powder rockets through my nasal cavities like an Apollo mission; I still hear my father saying that to me. Every time I try to help the pain, I still hear him. 

What would I say to him now? what explanation could I give of the person I have become? what has his son become?

If I could, I would tell him ""I never wanted this, it was an accident, I placed this burden in front of you, I feel like I don't have a choice anymore"".

I'm sorry.

>UPDATE (04/30/2013 0035 UTC): We have come a long way in the battle, but still do not have the upper hand.  It's looking more and more like a restructuring of the tor software or even the tor network will be required to mitigate the kind of attack we are under.  If this can be solved by modifying the tor client software running the silk road .onion, then it will be a matter of patching and redeploying the hidden service.  If it is a network issue, it will require the cooperation of the Tor developers, or running a new network of nodes.  I haven't given up hope for a faster solution, but if one can not be found, then we will move to a semi private scheme where users will be given access through many private URLs.  I'll keep everyone updated on how we will move forward, but please be prepared for a few more days at the least of no access.

There's a strong batch of tar going around Houston," I've had a low level heroin habit for 5 months after I was released from prison 6 months ago. I've managed to hold down a 40 hour a week job, not use when I have custody of my daughter, and in general, be less of a fuck up since before I was in prison. I still thought of myself as an addict, but an addict on a positive trajectory.

Until today.

To preface, when I use these days, I usually score .2 or .3g ($20-$30) and either inject a 20 all at once, or split a 30. Every once in a while, if I've been feeling physical withdrawal symptoms, like today, I'll try to stretch a 20 out to taper a bit before I discontinue use for awhile. The most I've injected all at once in recent memory was .3g,  and while I was very, very high, I was reasonably coherent.

So I've been doing more h than usual in the past week or so, and after being off for about 36 hours I began to get sick I scored .2g for $20 off my connect in SW Houston, split it in half, and cooked up some tar that cooked up very dirtily, with a large amount of dark brown, particulate matter. I pulled about 25 units into my point, and injected it.

I woke up in an ambulance. I could see when they were about to run the narcan into me. This is where I'm happy my physical addiction is pretty mild, I felt so happy, so FUCKING COLD, but so happy when I came out of the high. I immediately started crying my eyes out. My kid's mom came to see me in the hospital. It was sweet of her, more than I deserved. My best friend came to pick me up. He didn't really know how to handle it, didn't really know what to do when his best friend of 20 years wouldn't stop crying. But he was there, and that counts.

Friend dropped off some pot, another friend dropped off 3 mg of Ativan. This is goodbye to opiates for me gentlemen. I've never overdosed in 5 years of injecting heroin. I have an eight year old daughter to look out for, not to mention a family that loves me despite my best efforts to the contrary.

tl;dr Strong batch of dirty looking tar floating around Houston. Try not to use alone (like my dumb ass) and be conservative with your dose.",1367305961.0

being as I've known this 3 for ever, I have an open door policy for them at my house. but still. I locked my pills in a little lockbox safe.
on this day I was taking a shower, they all come over at different times, but all within the same hour. they all inform me when they showed up. 
long story short - I get out. 2 of them are gone...and so is my lockbox and pill.
I call and bring down hell on them, I interrogate all 3...and of course. no one took anything. go figure.
I call the cops. files theft report. call doctors. inform them what happened and that I filled a report.
when I return to my doctors? he informs me that under the pain management contract I signed over a year ago - #3. I shall keep my medication from loss, damage or theft.
informs me, its beyond his call now. with the police report filed. I legally fucked my self of breach of contract. he can no longer supply me...

TL;DR - friend steals pills. i do the right thing and inform police and doctors. I breach contract by not keeping my pills from loss or theft. lose monthly script of 30mg oxys after 2 years...

They're not quite acute or strong as dope WD but still very rough. I ordered some kratom and it has been huge as it completely eliminates my WD for about 5-8 hours.

Problem is though when I go to sleep I end up waking up back in WD so I decided to try immodium which had never really worked for me in the past. I popped about 20mg prior to sleep. HOLY SHIT! I was like buzzing as I dozed off, and when I woke up I felt awesome! I don't know it is a fluke or what but Immodium really can elimnate alot of your WD symptoms.

So now I'm using Kratom in tandem with Immodium and really feel great. After I finish my final exams I will come up with a game plan for enduring the WD so I can get better because right now I'm just delaying the inevitable.

""I am going to shoot heroin tomorrow.""

Now I'd been sniffing dope pretty much every day for the past 2 weeks (and chipping for the past 5 years); a small tolerance had begun to creep up on me, despite my religious adherence to the ingestion of 60mg Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide 45 minutes prior to each rail. Dope had become routine.

I recalled, with a certain nostalgia, just months prior: deeply aching in soul(!) but not body, for each and every Friday evening to finally roll around, this magical time at which the insufflation of my drug of choice became perfectly acceptable for the next 24 hours, a perfect inversion from the Sinister, detestable activity it would be if performed on a weekday.

1) Dissolve 21 mg of ~60% w/w DAM HCl in 0.2 mL deionized water. [Tan chunky powder becomes clear solution with cloudy precipitate]

2) Pass through .22 micron filter into back end of 28G 1/2 inch BD Insulin Syringe.

3) Wash filter with 0.3 mL H2O into Syringe. [Final solution is clear]

I insert the plunger into the fully loaded rig, careful not to squirt even a drop of this precious solution out the spike. It is ready. I am alone.

The butterflies are beating too strong for me to proceed at this time. I call my father and we talk for a bit as I scout my arm for blue streaks. I'm gonna do some homework now. I love you.

I do a bit of a 100yd stare, frown a little, then actually lol a bit as I think, ""Fuck it! We'll do it live!"" I stick the needle in, ""oh wow it doesn't even hurt, how the fuck am I supposed to register with one awkward hand like this, Jesus Christ did I just Capri-Sun right through my vein? oh fuck pull out"". Whoops. Instantly the site turns green as my blood seeps out from the tiny puncture wound I made inside myself.

I spot a particularly juicy vein in the crook of my right arm and decide to try it (though I'd always imagined using my left hand to shoot would be tricky). As soon as the tip is in, I apply negative pressure like I've read in how many countless threads on opiophile and bluelight. PLUME. Fuck yeah. I begin to push, sloooooow. I at least want to recognize it if I start to fall out. Say goodbye to the world, maybe? Heh, now that's a little morbid for such a happy occasion. After 2 minutes I've pussy-footed around enough and the whole shot is in me.

Where is the rush? Did I miss? I check my pupils in the mirror. Their diameter has decreased. I agree with them, and decide that my mood is indeed slightly improved from baseline. Maybe my tolerance is larger than I thought. Repeat from step 1. Again, no rush to speak of, but at this point I am feeling goooood. Proud of myself too. I decide to 'go for it' tomorrow.


4/26/13

I prep a 60mg shot, according to prior protocol. This time I use 30G spikes, hoping to avoid more giant green bruises. Everything goes swimmingly.

This happened within the last few weeks. I had just spent several painful days out of town at my parents with no opiates at my disposal, and despite making it through the worst, when I got back into town, I wanted to get something in the worst kind of way. The problem was, my bf and I had not a dime to our name and were not expected to get any money for a few more days. At the time, my bf's step dad was in the hospital, so he had been spending a lot of time at his parents' place too (they live in the same town as us) keeping his mom company. We were both resigned to the fact that it would be a few more days before we had money to score, but then my bf got the text that any junkie hates seeing when they're broke. Apparently one of his connects was passing thru town with some ""fire"" H, and if he were to come to him to get it that night, he'd get an amazing deal. The catch was the deal was for that night only. My bf tried getting him to front us til we got paid or negotiate the same deal for when we did have money, but the H dude wouldnt budge. And of course, the drugs were all we could think about after getting the text. My bf tossed out the idea,of finding something at his parents' place to pawn-something he had always been against doing. He knew of a gun that his step dad didnt keep in his safe, and figured we could easily get enough to cover the amount needed to get the deal. He reasoned with himself that his step dad wouldnt be out of the hospital until the next week, and by then we would have the $ to get it out without anyone being none the wiser. 

So before we could talk ourselves out of it, we grabbed the gun and headed to the pawn shop. He was going to have me pawn it, since his wallet had been lifted a few months prior and had yet to get his ID replaced. This was because his social security card was also in his wallet, and he was unable to find an original copy of his birth certificate....so long story short there, he was in this stupid ID loophole and got lazy about replacing it. When we got to the pawn shop, my bf knew the guy working so he didn't end up asking him for an ID, we got the cash we needed, got the deal we craved, and spent the next 36 hours in a nodding bliss. Then, bad karma struck us..his step dad ended up getting out of the hospital earlier than expected. Not a HUGE deal, we had just hoped we would already have the gun back before that happened. We got money the next day, and first thing we did was run to the pawn shop to get the gun out. There, we ran into a problem. Apparently, an ID is required when retrieving a firearm from a pawn shop. We tried explaining that he was never ID'd from the get go, and were not told this was required for pick up, but the store wouldnt budge. Said it was a federal law. So even though I practically got on my hands and knees crying and begging, we left empty handed. Already being aware of the hassle it was to get his ID, we irresponsibily spent the money on getting high instead. He spent the next few days avoiding his parents' calls. After a week or so passed, we came into some money again and I did what we should have done a long time ago...I called his mom.at her work and asked if she knew where an original copy of his birth certificate was. She did not, but said she would go by the courthouse to request one for him. I asked if we could pick it up from her at her work, once she got it, since bf was still avoiding his parents' house and step dad. She was fine with that, and I was optimistic we were in the clear since the gun was never brought up. A few days later, we were leaving the DMV, after getting a fresh ID, and heading back to the pawn shop. Everything was working out as planned and just as we were waiting for them to bring the gun out to us, another bombshell was dropped--the gun had already been picked up. Apparently his step dad had just went into pick it up the day before. So, then we were left shaking in our boots, worried that his step dad had reported it stolen and that the cops would show up any minute to arrest my bf. Luckily, that didnt happen. 

Today, my bf called his step dad and fessed up. Well, kinda. He told him we needed the money to help pay a bill and had planned on getting it out the next day if it hadnt been for the ID situation. He told him we were on our way there to pay him back for the cost of having to get it out. Fortunately, his parents werent as upset as we expected them to be. They even let us keep most of the money we intended on giving them. Crisis adverted, we took the money and celebrated by picking up a half g and spent the evening on a cloud. 

Moral of the story-- dont pawn shit that doesnt belong to you. Even if you have the best intentions. Hell, dont even pawn your own shit. Maybe the moral of this story is to just stop doing this shit altogether, because eventually, it causes nothing but headaches. But its always easiest to say you will quit when youre laying here feeling comfortably numb.

Decent read.,"Original post http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ddtov/for_the_past_2_months_ive_been_on_a_forth_a_strip/

Surgery worked out, anesthesiologist was good. I called office that night at midnight to see when office hours would be but some over nigjt lady answered and dumbassly called the on call doctor. I told him everything and all he said was ""Jesus it's 1 am Why the FUCK r u calling me."" He said that sentence like 3 times and said ""ARE YOU ON DRUGS RIGHT NOW?"" in a angry pissed off voice. I said no & then he said ""just tell he anesthist tomorrow. I'm going to bed.""


So I called the office at 8 am the minute it opened. Anesthetist wasn't there but I talked to a nurse and told her & was set up to see meet with anesthetist before surgery alone (had to have driver home so mom came.) 

Anyways so weird - Neither he nor the doctor knew what suboxone was and didn't google it either they just kept asking me what it was. Because of that they used non narcotic pain medication and I think more of the knock you out shit. Guy just said, ""Yaaaa... you should probably get that shit checked into by a clinic so it's not illegal, & parents wouldn't find out. (Is that true even though it hits medical insurance?)

How many poppies would one have to grow to produce enough usable opium (I've researched the process, and am fairly confident I could manage) to get high a good few times? I'm not looking to become a regular user, I'm just interested in the different spiritual/self exploration/creativity boosting altered states of mind that can come from plants. Ideally, I would raise my poppies from seedlings, reap the fruits of my labor, and then start again. I highly enjoy my weed, and am looking into making LSA, as well as exploring the different effects that can be gotten from various herbal smokes.

BUT, I also have a potential problem. I think I'm CYP2D6 enzyme deficient/have the slow-acting phenotype. I think this because, ever since I was a child, I seem to have a super human resistance to anesthetics, I was popping hydrocodone like nobody's business when I got three dry sockets from wisdom tooth surgery and they did next to nothing, aaand a normal adult dose of DXM seems to push me somewhere between plateaus 2 and 3. All of those things seem to point to a prob with the enzyme. So my second question is - can I even expect to get any effects from smoking opium or making a nice poppy tea?

Please read and help me out, I don't know where else to go.","I have been taking oral OxyContin for my pain management (basically early arthritis in both my hips)  for quite some time now but it seems like I am completely and 100% tolerant to the drug. I get prescribed 28 x 80mg tabs and 20 x 20mg Instant Release OxyNorm (Oxycodone also) tabs a week. Also I'm from Australia not the US and I have been lurking for a while.
I have been trying to cut back to form a collection and to reduce tolerance because I feel like I'm wasting, as I'm feeling nothing from them, I can take up to like 4-5 80OC pills (without the coating AND crushed) and feel **absolutely** nothing.
I'm 20 years old and pretty ignorant about the whole 'injecting' side of things, i've never done it, wouldn't know how (and don't really intend on doing so)... so oral is my only option at the moment. I imagine that this is where a lot of people start out and when they get to this point they move to railing because it's more of an extreme hit and you actually get your worth/money out of the drugs? 

**Is this even true?:**
I feel like I have some sort of amazing supply when I read some threads about $1/mg+ street prices, considering I get 2640mg for like 60 bucks from the pharmacy each week.

I have also been on an 'opiate rotation' which worked out awfully for me, the rotation was Oxycodon -> Fentanyl -> Methadone (to reduce tolerance) then back to Oxy. Fentanyl (even in high doses, trust me) did absolutely nothing to me BUT I wasn't feeling any withdrawals from oxy so it must have done something... and the exact same with methadone and god help me when I was withdrawing from that methadone I felt the worst.

I'm not sure if this is relevant but I'm very curious... I've taken around 3 different ecstasy pills (and I took them with my GF and it worked on her, so I know they were all legit) and felt nothing at all. I have also tried pure MDMA pills (once again with the GF, who it affected) that also did nothing, hell I took 2 and she took 1. LSD, 2c-i-nbome etc seems to be the exact same, am I immune to drugs or something? Am I just brain-dead with no receptors active in my brain any more (ignorance isn't so blissful)?
Wow I don't even know what I just wrote, but my GP sure as hell won't understand...

**tl;dr:** I am immune to oral oxy at VERY high (450mg+) doses, even crushed and with no coating, what the hell is wrong with me? Will my tolerance ever go down again, how long do you think?

I also feel no effect from other drugs such as MDMA and LSD (I know they were legit because I have tried them all multiple times from different people AND each time I did it with my partner who felt the full effects)

2. There is some rather potent #4 going around the South/South West areas of the country (USA) right now.

I’ve been into doing drugs for quite awhile, but as I have progressed into my early 20’s I’ve calmed down a lot and don’t wildly try to do every drug I can find. These days for the most part I usually drink (about 2-3 times a week albeit heavily) and do H (about once every 4-7 days). I first tried H last year and was using on and off but for the first time now I’ve been using steadily for about four months. I used to mainly snort it but for about the past 2+ months I’ve been IVing exclusively. Only usually IV 2 stamps at once and have never IVed more than 3 in a day. I never really get sick or get cravings particularly badly anymore. It’s not like I’ve never been there, it’s just now my use seems to be at a point where neither of these things have happened to me in awhile.
  
Pretty much everyone I’m around on a daily basis uses drugs. I can think of many of them that seem to use their drug/s of choice without restraint and seemingly everyday. Where they get the money I will never fucking know. However, only a few of them use H, none of them regularly and none of them IV.

I would say I’ve always had a reputation as one of the harder users of the group, but that’s just me looking outward. However ever since people have found out I’ve been IVing, my name has absolutely gone to shit even with other drug users. Friends have stopped talking to me the same way and I am constantly hearing about people talking to others about me and my use. I now have this reputation of being a straight up smack head. I am almost afraid to show my face in my home town even though I've never been there since I started IVing! 

I’m enrolled in a great program at a quality 4 year university, always get good grades and generally keep my life in order as good as, if not better than most. Yet this does not seems to matter to anyone. It’s getting to the point now where I don’t know what to do anymore and I think that even stopping won’t solve things with others. I feel totally persecuted as I see my use as more controlled nowadays than lots of others and tend to have a better hold on my life than many.

Just wanted to express my frustration and see if anyone else has been here before.

1dhxe4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1dhxe4/lets_talk_about_diphenhydraminedhm/,25,https://redd.it/1dhxe4,Orange_Uncle_Monkey,Lets talk about Diphenhydramine(DHM).,"I have made mention of shooting benedryl as an effective way to cure needle fetish in a couple of posts and it's gotten more attention than I was expecting. I decided to start this thread to answer any questions you may have and to also warn against the dangers of shooting pills.

1st off, when deciding what to buy it's very important that you only buy the stuff with only DHM in it. Other allergy medications can me deadly if injected.   
The best brands I have found for shooting are the pink gel caps that come in the blister packs. They contain a powder that is soluble in water. The pink gel tabs from walmart that come in the bottle gel up when mixed with water and clog up the cotton filter when drawing them up with a syringe. Personally I get mine from the Dollar General, they come in a white box that has ""Allergy Relief"" written in pink. I have hear of people using the liqugels and mixing the liquid that's inside those tabs with water but, I recommend against that. The liquagels contain glycerin and that's not the best thing to put in your veins.

Prepping these things for IV is a lot like prepping a Roxie or Blue for IV but, just in case I will go through a step by step process. You will need all the materials usally required for IV. 

1. Boil about 50 - 60 units of water in your cooker, the powder will take up about 40 units of your rig when you are done so only start with as much water that will fill up half your rig.

2. Tap the powder to the bottom of the gel tab, and cut the very tip top of the tab off. Dump it into the cooker that contains your pre-heated water. You don't want to heat the water with the DHM powder in it. It will cause the insoluble parts of the pill melt into your solution, you don't want that trust me.

3. Stir with the cap of your rig, like I said this stuff is water soluable so it doesn't require that much mixing. Just make sure to break-up any clumps and you are good to go.

4. Filter and load. If you have wheel filters by all means use them. If not a piece of cotton the size of a tic-tac will work fine. I usually filter a couple, three times. You want the final product to be as clear as possible.

5. The shooting process, if you don't know how to find a vein then this is not for you. Shooting DHM is not something that you want to do unless you are a IV vet trying to get a needle fix. Also, anti-histamines burn when injected, they will burn all the way up the vein. Don't freak out, this is the opposite of a histamine reaction. It may feel like you are shooting acid but, I promise it's not doing anymore damage than anything else you may chose to inject. The burning can actually be a good thing because it guarantee that you are not missing. 

DHM has a rush, its a weird rush and it's not unpleasant but, it's not the euphoric rush you get from opiates. You will probably get a little drowsy afterwards to. It's a great way to get to sleep at night. 

If you are trying to get off of opiates for good, shooting DHM is a good way to change the associations your brain makes with the needle. In our everyday lives we do things on occasion that causes the body to release it's own natural opiates (ie eating, sleeping, having sex) This is natures way of reinforcing beneficial actions. Do something good, get a reward. That is why the needle becomes such a fixation, we have trained out brains to think that poking ourselves  with a needle is better than sex. Although shooting DHM does produce an effect, it doesn't trigger our natural reward system the same way that opiates do. That's why it is a good way to change to associations.


I guess I should briefly talk about DHM as a potenator because it's a great one. If you are almost out of H, or your opiate of choice mixing a small amount of DHM in with it is a good way to make that little dose feel like a bigger one. This even works with suboxone, I hesitate telling you guys this because mixing DHM with sub can create a full on opiate rush when IV'd.(although not a great one) I hesitate telling you this because doing this completely defeats the purpose of suboxone and DHM. I trust you guys to make good choices. 

Also, SHOOTING PILLS IS REALLY, REALLY BAD FOR YOU. If you don't already know shooting any pill is a bad idea due to the binders and fillers that are in pills. These binders and fillers can wreak havoc on your lungs and eyes. Please, use discretion. There is not such thing as filtering too much when it comes to shooting pills.

If you guys can get your hands on the liquid DHM that they have in hospitals please let me know. I really want a vile of that stuff.

First opiates post.,"Fellow bropiette, erm, I think that is the correct term for us ladies, here. I'm sorry if this seems like a wall of text, but bear with me.


A lot of people have questions as to which is better, which has led to a lot of arguments. In my time (6 years now) as a junkie, I've been bounced around from city to city, state to state,  enrolling in rehab programs or just getting the fuck-its and doing whatever I wanted.

Here are the places I've lived, where I've copped, and what/how the substance was.

Black Tar Heroin and Mexican Gunpowder - I started out my career as a junkie here in Southern California. I've picked up in SD (Poway, El Cajon, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach, Del Mar), I've picked up out of my native Inland Empire (Homeland, Temecula, Riverside), and I've picked up out of the desert (Indio, Cathedral City, Palm Desert, and Palm Springs). Out of all these, I would have to say the gunpowder I'd get in Riverside was off the chains insanely good, but it hasn't come around for a while. Saw China White (quote unquote) the other day and banged like a .5 rock knowing it wasn't shit.... I'll take my stanky sticky BT any day, thank you.

BEST CITY - RIVERSIDE (Gunpowder)
WORST CITY - PALM SPRINGS (Tar).... One city over, Indio, has some good, but if you're in PS, you're more likely to get jacked by tweakers than score a bag.

I moved to Washington state and started picking up out there (Lynnwood, Marysville, Seattle, Everett, Federal Way), and TBH the dope wasn't that great there. The meth was a different story.... had me vomiting after a couple twists. My best connect was in Lynnwood and he thought I was cute, so he'd throw me a handful of valiums in with my sack. In Washington it is strictly BTH being sold. 

BEST CITY - LYNNWOOD / EVERETT / BREMERTON (BTH)
WORST CITY - MARYSVILLE, SEATTLE

ECP / China White - I moved to Memphis TN about a year and a half ago and this shit blew. my motherfucking mind. I'm talking about a rush so hard off a point you fall to your fucking knees like you're in church at confession. I picked up out of MS too, but my favorite came from the dope tracks out in North Memphis. Just a beautiful powder that would come in a chunk and have to be smashed into powder. There was nothing like the feel of taking 10cc's of water, being able to mix your shit in it, take a 10cc shot and be fucking floored.


I'm more used to the BTH scene having spent most of using years in Cali.

Here's what I can say for BTH:

For a long time I stopped getting the nods, and they JUUUST came back to me. I left Cali to go to TN with my boyfriend and had that ECP, then moved to WA for a couple months and was getting that shit they try to push as tar in the PNW. Now I'm back in Cali, and I've been getting some shit so good I can't even describe it. Blissful.

ECP - That's a whole other fucking rodeo. Where you would catch me shooting up to a g and a half of tar a day, I could only handle .2 in a shot at most and mixed into like 30 cc's. I had met many east-coast junkies in my west coast rehabs, and I always laughed when they told me the dope was better back home. Well I moved to Memphis and finally got my chance. My first round I did half a point and it just fucking knocks your legs out from under you it's so good. It's like BTH injection, you get a little mmm warm n fuzzy, ECP is like HOLY SHITTTT enormous rush. I would compare taking a shot of ECP to taking a shot of relief. That's what it feels like. Like all the troubles in the world don't matter. I only nodded a few times off ECP but it was extreme. In general, ECP also gave me a shit ton of energy and no appetite. I would take a shot, clean my apartment, take my dog on a couple mile walk, come home, take a shower, then cook dinner for my man when he got off work.

BTH does your body like shit. It keeps clogging up my veins and leaving little balls of dope cut wherever I shoot, whereas with ECP I can hit the same sweet spot over and over again.


IMO, if I could get it, I would be all over the TN ECP. I think I prefer those out of the two.

Any other bi-coastal junkies want to share?

My roommate, former best friend and pretty much was my only friend, just packed all his shit and left for good after a fight I started. He went to move in with this other friend that I lost I told him I regretted ever being friends with him, and even punched him for no reason. I don't know who I have turned into.

I don't blame him. What have i become?

Opiates have fucked me. They have turned things that were good to me into something I despise.

Now I have nothing. And will always have nothing. 

I have turned into a total loser dbag. Spending all my parents allowance on something that they would kill me for.

But the real sad part is I am not missing my friend as much as I should be right now. Opiates have fucking destroyed my mindset. I can't believe the shit I said to his face. I don't know what has happened to me. It is like I have turned.... so indifferent and despicable.... I hate it. I hate the harm I have caused other people. 

Now what I have done can't be undone.

If I used heroin this is where I would put some witty connection to putting a needle on the record to putting a needle on my arm, but you get what I mean.

I could nod away at any second; the music forming around me produces a hectic feeling surrounding my docile body, like a singular pane of tinted glass in the middle of a battlefield.
 
For a split second I feel fragile, this feeling is too enjoyable for my own good, it has a grip on me that I wouldn’t want to let up, it’s squeezing the life from my veins in the most pleasurable way possible and I welcome it with open arms. By now the pills are just part of life, as incorporated into my daily routine as waking up every morning, would I even get out of bed if it wasn’t for the pills?

I stare like a Junkie into the TV every day waiting for something to change, I don’t know what to feel anymore, I don’t even know IF I can feel anything anymore.

And on a side-note: does anyone have any tips/experience with getting a suboxone script in LA? Specifically the downtown area. I don't want to end up on the street and that's currently the direction I'm headed. I am covered under my parents' insurance plan (BC/BS), and am hoping that will significantly reduce the cost. Realistically I'd only need one month's worth as I've been tapering on my own the last couple months, and 1/16th or 1/32nd is enough to keep me well for 1-1.5 days.

Any advice, such as where to go or how much it'll cost, is greatly appreciated. I just moved here and am fairly unfamiliar with everything.

I'm curious about how other users keep their gear. I use the box from the Lou Reed, ""Between Thought and Expression"" box set. Thought it was appropriate. The CDs themselves have long since been lost or pawned. Inside; paper towels to avoid leaving soot marks. A cheap spoon (wish I had a cooler one). Current rig and a ""fixing rig"", which is marked with a Sharpie. Webbed ""D"" ring belt. A baggie for new, clean rigs as well as an oral syringe. Contact lens case for water. A baggie with Q-tips and Sight Savers (alcohol wipes). A baggie for leftover wax papers for those hard times. Last but not least, a baggie for balloons.

These are the bags I've been getting over the past week, I was curious if to this is the average size for slips around other parts of the country. To me, these are a little skimp, but I tend to think the powder is relatively good. Basically 16$ a piece when buying a bun.

The above picture is that bag emptied out, not chopped up, just dumped out. It's ""flakey"" I guess you could say, sticks to the card or what i'm using to line it up/chop it up. Pretty light colored stuff.

These are some bags I can pick up from time to time through a friend, however they don't help me out very often and when they do they up-charge me. It comes in little grocery bag corners, wrapped in aluminum like the second picture shows. Used to always be solid rock, but now it's more powdery with some chunks in it. It's darker, but i'd say it's the average color of the stuff that floats about in my parts. These are also a little bit smaller than usual. The dealer charges 20, I have to pay 25 going thru the middle people.
  
I'm curious because I'm relatively new to dope, been doing it the past two months. Like most, I switched because it was cheaper and I enjoy it a little more. Are these two examples some decent looking stuff? I have a medium tolerance, it takes 2-3 of the 42's to feel pretty great, 4 will have me floored. The other stuff I can do a whole and feel pretty right, if I do I get rocked. I'm a nose cowboy btw.

In a haze coming off of smoking 20 roxies the night before, wishing I had just ONE left to bring me out of my sickness. It was the ultimate Catch-22. I felt like such a piece of shit that I couldn't do anything but think about scoring so I could study for my finals. My mind was racing, I knew I was going to fail my classes and time was running out. I wasn't going to go without a fight. No matter how hard I tried I just couldn't focus on my textbook. I knew that if I had some medicine in me I would be able to get some work done. I put all of my energy into finding some, and after many hours of laying in bed, staring at the clock, shaking and sweating, I got a phone call and knew relief was coming shortly. It was about time because it felt like a million scarabs were crawling under my skin, pushing against the walls and trying to escape like a bunch of trapped prisoners.

I was too sick to get out of my bed so I had my medicine delivered straight to my room. I crawled out of bed and barely made it to the door. There it was, one little blue pill smaller than a penny, a pill with all the power in the world over me, a pill stronger than anyone and everyone. The mere thought of what was about to happen put some life back into my legs. I carefully stood up and frantically searched for the first piece of foil I could find and a tooter. I was about to be back in my world, the world I loved and was so comfortable in, the world that was quickly crumbling right before my eyes. But at that moment I didn't care. If my world was going down I was going down with it. I took a flame to the perfectly straightened foil and my eyes zoned in on the beautiful pill, sliding down the foil like a teardrop rolling down a cheek. This was my ritual and I loved it as much as getting high itself. I inhaled the dense, blissful smoke of the first hit into my tired lungs and immediately felt as if a thousand pounds were lifted off of my shoulders. Suddenly everything in the world was right again. The pain was gone. Things weren't as bad as they seemed. All my problems seemed to fade under a cover of that thick smoke. ""This is the life"" I thought to myself. With every hit I felt like a part of me was coming back, until I was whole again. Life felt so simple, but deep down I knew I was only fooling myself. I was extremely depressed, but so what, I had what I needed at the moment and I felt okay with myself. Now was not the time to think about my problems, ""I'll deal with those some other time.""

I looked down at the foil and all I saw was a black spot. I tried to scrape one last hit but didn't get much. I finally felt decent enough to study, so I took out my textbook. Finally, now I can study like my life depends on it. I was so determined to pass this class and show my teacher that he was wrong. I read one word and thats when I realized how foolish I was. There was NO WAY in hell I was going to study. Now that I felt pretty good, all I wanted to do was enjoy my high. My mind was already on getting my next fix, so it's not like I could study even if I wanted to. I felt like such a dick because I told myself I was going to study after I got high, but I didn't care, I was too busy feeling good. I was so overwhelmed and torn that I broke down in tears. I didn't want this anymore, but I didn't know how to get out of it. I put myself in this trap, and I didn't even realize it. No one was answering my phone calls. My meds were wearing off and I knew it would be a long, cold, and sad night ahead. I wrapped myself in my blankets, just staring at the ceiling, trying my hardest to fall asleep. Sleep was my light at the end of the tunnel.""What a lucky guy I am"" I sarcastically thought to myself. All I had to look forward to was same pathetic miserable routine the next day. This was not the life I wanted to live, being miserable day after day, living for the short and ever fleeting moments of relief that my pills would bring me.

Lately my tolerance has been growing a bit, and I'd say I use the heroin equivalent of 120-150mg of oxy a day, maybe give or take a bit depending on the day..

I've been away at school all semester so its been pretty easy for me to get away with this, but when I'm home, I really don't want my parents to catch on that I'm using. I've got myself 5x10mg methadone and could get more before I go home, but I've never used it before so I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not. 

I'm thinking the first few days I go home, my mom is definitely gunna have her eye on me, as I think she's already suspicious that I've been using. So, I think I'm mainly gunna be using methadone the first couple days at least so that I never have to be stepping away to do lines or anything like that...

I usually do H all day, so its hard to say how much I use at once.. I'd say my average dose to get me content now is probably close to 60mg worth of oxy at once (but I usually sniff the heroin equivalent of that dose).

I'm thinking that probably 10-20mg of methadone will hold me over..

I dunno, I don't have any specific questions I guess.. just kinda wondering if you guys think the methadone will serve my needs, and if you think I should try and get more before I go home or anything...

Also, I have a surgery coming up, and I don't really want to inform the doctor about my usage if I can avoid it, so I'd like to lower my tolerance as much as possible before the appointment, and I was wondering if methadone would help with doing a quick taper??

would I need more than 50mg to taper, or will that be enough since my tolerance isn't extremely high?

am I over estimating the power of methadone? Right now, based off what I've read, I feel like 20mg should be more than enough to have me feeling ok all day..",1367763149.0

I have been chipping at good #3 and amazing #4 most weekends for the last year or so, snorting only. By the time these land it will be over 2 weeks since I've touched anything. After reading I'm expecting more of an itchy body load high - sounds fantastic!

So, I was going to start with 20mg orally and then maybe try snorting some to top up. Does this seem a sensible start? Also once I'm used to them, is mixing with H recommended? Its essentially the same thing in my brain, right?

But Walgreens is using a nationwide prescription drug monitoring database check on most C-2's,"Im sure this isn't news here. but Walgreens has recently implemented a prescription drug monitoring program that involves utilizing a database of all a persons scripts filled at all pharmacies nationwide. They're doing this in response to pressure from the DEA over the number of C2 scripts that they've been filling which kind of seems silly, they are one of the largest pharmacy chains in the country hence they're  going to fill the most C2 scripts. Their new procedure is to look up in a database of all pharmacies nationwide where you've had scripts at. So if you had doctor A write you a script for say oxy 30's meant to last 30 days and you paid cash for it at say rite aid. And then you go to doctor B and get another script for oxy 30's and bring it to Walgreens before the 30 days of doctor A's script is up they will see it and refuse to fill it. And if the pharmacist feels like being a dick about it he may even write his findings from the database on your hardcopy making it hard to fill somewhere else. Basically they're cracking down on doctor shopping. So far they are doing this procedure on all oxycodone products not containing APAP, methadone, opana, fentanyl, exalgo, hydromorphone and, OxyContin. They've also removed these drugs from the prescription savings club program which reduces the cost for cash patients looking to avoid high costs and insurance limitations. Also if they see you are doctor shopping they will contact doctors A and B and inform them of your multiple scripts and the doc could decide to cut you off. So be aware Walgreens is now doing this now nationwide. Hopefully it doesn't become an industry wide trend. ",1367742580.0

Last saturday, I also did some H that had me floored.

It had been about a month since I had done opiates of any kind, so my tolerance was pretty low. After my binge Friday/Saturday/Sunday, I felt like shit, W/D's and all. I had taken loperamide for WDs before with great results, so I tried it again.

They worked amazing, took away my anxiety as well as the RLS, so I was actually able to sleep. I had taken about 50mg Monday night. 

Having such a great result, and having my anxiety and sinus issues come back, I decided to take some more. Surprisingly, somehow, anxiety problems were gone, as well as sinus problems. (One of my main reasons for using dope in the past is my awful sinus problems, I was actually able to breath through my nose when using dope)

So I ended up taking some Wednesday night, Thursday morning, and Friday night as well. I got a hold of some good H this morning, shot it, and felt nothing. Thought it might have been bogus, so I grabbed some 8mg diluadids and shot the whole thing. Nothing.

Is it possible that loperamide can screw with my tolerance? Does anyone know? It would surprise me even if it could, because I'd have to imagine even 40mg is terribly weak compared to H and/or diluadid.

TL;DR - has anyone had any experience where loperamide screws with their tolerance? seems absolutely crazy to me, but I can't think of another explanation. ",1367722814.0

Combo'd with MXE and holy fuck.,"So I've tried a few vicodin before and found it interesting, worth the experience but not the cost.

Got 100mg of H for $40 or so and tried snorting that, 30mg gives me a nice heavy buzz as I keep myself non-tolerant and my opiod experiences uncommon.

Nice, but not really worth the price, not when I get nausea and itchiness strongly even with DPH and weed.

So I was down to my last 30mg and decided to snort it along with 80mg of MXE (methoxetamine).  For those not in the know it runs ~$40/g. on the darknet (don't ask where here), it's similar to ketamine but lasts hours longer, kind of has its own opiod feel, and it potentates opiods and lowers tolerance to them big time.

30mg H + 80mg MXE = a super hard nod where I felt removed from my body.  Just a brain floating around.  The H made MXE's ""confusion"" super enjoyable and more ""I don't give a fuck"", and MXE ate up the H's nausea and itchiness.

I'm told this combo can be dangerous with higher doses, but I'm just going to do that 30/80 combo twice a month or something.

Highly recommend you check it out, just be careful and work your dose slowly up as MXE potentates H hard.

I don't really enjoy H solo (not enough to be worth the nausea+itchiness+price), or MXE solo (too weird/confusing/lacking euphoria), but together makes it all worth it.

Okay, basically... To get the strongest shots, what is the best ratio of pills to water?

We all know that the maximum concentration of morphine is 60 mg per 1 ml of water. So, in theory, two 30 mg of MSIRs crushed and soaked in one milliliter of water should give you the strongest shot.

Okay, from experience I can tell you that is bullshit. To begin with, that's not nearly enough water to soak the crushed pills adequately. Even if I soak one pill in one milliliter of water, draw that liquid up, squirt it over another crushed pill to let it absorb another 30 mg of morphine and then finally draw and shoot that, I can guarantee you there is no where near 60 mg of morphine in that solution.

So what I'm asking here is this...

Does anyone have an ideal ratio of pills to water? Because, honestly, even though I wash my pills until what I'm drawing back up has zero bitter taste, I feel like I'm wasting a ton of morphine every time I put ten MSIR 30s into a spoon. Plus, to be frank, I'd like to get as close to a full 60 mg per ml as possible.

(As a side note, would evaporating the solution produce a higher concentration? If I evaporated all the liquid would I be left with morphine powder/crystals/whatever along with whatever particulate matter I failed to filter?)

Okay, that's all I've got... Here's hoping someone out there can help.

I don't want to say I know her(we just say hi everytime we see each-other because we know were in the same group together----Also shes absolutely gorgeous in my opinion...super sexyyyy)--that should sum-up our friendship though, If you guys even want to call it that.. Id call it on the lines of an acquaintance...but anyways I end up saying hello and then figure to ask her how she thought group was today.. she says it was okay nothing special and I agree because it had to be one of the slowest and most annoying groups yet because of another group member who wouldn't STFU...anyways she proceeds to tell me she is going to get high and if I wanted to join in on the fun (she knew I relapsed because I said it in group) so I decide to go hang with her... We end up going all the way to the other side of the island to cop from her guy... On the way back I decide that I'm going to call one of my good friends and see if we could swing by his house and hang out while we do what we have to do. I call, and he says yes of course as long as I throw him something, witch I'm fine with. As soon as we get there, I've never seen someone get her rig ready so fast, I was about half way done with mine. She does 2 bags of this ""Hard Ten"" as its stamped on it in red lettering. I had a decent amount of money on me so I pick up 3 bundles for us, I guess you guys can say I was trying to show off my money, even though I'm broke half the time..I came into some money because it was my birthday weekend. So she finishes getting it ready and then bangs it, She melts into the chair she's sitting in. So I finish getting mine ready ( I did 5 bags because that's what I would usually do...and also some of these bags were fat as hell) After I finish fixing up...she asks me how many did I do...I tell her 5, She says to only do half of it, me being the dickhead I am I do it all. She says it was the best shit she has gotten in a really long time. So after I bang up I immediately get pins and needles in my whole body and then get one  the hardest rushes I've ever had...after I finish she says ""you shouldn't have done it all...what happens after that, I had no fucking clue. She said I went blue in my lips and face and all of a sudden passed out and stopped breathing...When I wake up I see her in front of me with me laying on the ground, She has given me CPR to bring me back to life.. As I woke up she started to cry and after she told what had happened, I also proceeded to cry with her. After this whole ordeal we ended up talking all day and getting food together and hooking up and shit. I know I sound like a little kid and stuff and I'm making it seem like I overdosed and then didn't care, but I did go to hospital afterwards just to make sure everything was okay. Note: the hospital wasn't that far from where I was... Anyways, she has to be the most sweetest girl ever and I instantly fell in love, Why shuldnt I have, The girl saved my life pretty much. She and my boy said I stopped breathing for about 15-20 seconds. I feel like I owe this girl my life. 

I just wanted to share that little story of what happened to me today. I'm sorry guys if I misspelled anything and I'm sorry for the fact that I was kind of all over the place with that story kind of... But if you guys read the whole thing, I really appreciate it.

I was hanging out with this girl who shot up, and I'd always been curious, so I decided to give it a try.  Not my finest hour, but what can you do?  I did it exactly twice.  The first time was great, and a couple of days later I did it again.  I had her shoot me up, and I think she halfway missed the vein.  It hurt quite a bit, it bled, she had to re-position the needle, but it got done.  After that, and reading about all of the dangers of injection, I decided that this is just something that I can't do again.  I haven't talked to her since, and haven't fooled with it since.  The problem is that I have a small, purplish discoloration on the crook of my right arm where that second shot went.  It doesn't hurt, itch, it's not warm, there's no bump, it hasn't got bigger....but it doesn't seem to be going away either.  I have spent hours and hours googling, trying to figure out what the hell I've done to myself, and if it's ever going to go away, and I just really don't know.  Does anybody know what this might be?  I feel like just walking down the street that I'm wearing a big sign that says ""I shoot heroin.""  It's horribly embarrassing.

I know doctors usually progress from NSAIDs to triptans, but after that, where do they go? The triptans legitimately have not worked for me, yet ANY opiate has worked WONDERS. Hydrocodone, oxycodone, codeine, even tramadol.

Maybe a week ago, I got picked up from my house by a guy named J so we could go get 5 D's. We had to go to A's house, and then A's guy would show up and serve A, J and I. Someone who I don't know, I'll just call him ?, calls A and says he wants a pill and asks if we can front it for him, since he's going to be late. A and I are the only ones with money and we decide to do it, A pitched in $10 and i pitched in $15. We get the six pills and we're just chilling shooting the shit waiting for ? to get there, when suddenly it starts to drizzle a little. J's left windshield wiper is fucked up, so we couldn't wait the 20 minutes it would have taken ? to show up. A says he wants to buy some shit off me so he'll stop by my house later with the $15, I said alright, and J and I left.

A calls me and says he's on he's on his way around 6pm. At like 7:15 he texts me and says he ran out of gas, but somehow has my money, and gives me some bullshit story about his dad coming to give them some gas, apparently the problem was that he overestimated how far his car would go, passed up one gas station for another, then didn't make it to the second one, and his car died, but seriously, who fucking does that? Like, that's a bullshit story if i've ever heard one. He texts me around 8 and says he'll be over with my money in the morning. I said that it was fine.

The next morning rolls around, he doesn't call, I waited until like 5pm and I finally texted him and he says ""sorry bro i'm in (city 15 minutes away), i'm trying to get a ride back right now"" I said alright, let me know when you're in town, and of course, doesn't call back.

On the third day of A owing me $15, I waited until about 7:00pm, and then I called him. It rang and went to voice mail. I called a little later, it rang and went to voice mail again. I called again at like 7:30 and he rejected the call. Suddenly, a couple minutes later, A's dad calls me and asks if he can come through to pick up some shit. I said sure, he said he'd be like 45 minutes. I told A's dad to come through. And then after thinking about A's behavior, and his general disrespect for me in general (he's just a general doucher), I decided I'd let his dad know. I called his dad back and said ""Look, A's dad, I really don't want to start shit, but your kid's been disrespecting me and owes me money"" he asked how much, i told him, and I made sure A's dad knew that it was more about the disrespect than the amount of money. A's dad agreed that his kid is kind of a little shit, and said he'd call me back in five minutes and see if he could get me $15, I told him that would be awesome and thanked him profusely. When he came through, he was originally getting $20 worth of shit, but I felt bad that he had to cover his kid's debt, so i gave him $30 worth for his effort and understanding and just being a generally good guy. We talked more in-depth about everything that happened, and he agreed that I'd been disrespected and he said he'd have a talk with his son. A is like 24, by the way. 

Sure enough, 30 minutes after A's dad leaves my house, A calls me and starts yelling at me telling me that he has to find somewhere else to sleep tonight and that it's all my fault and I pretty much listened to what he had to say and then said ""You owe me, and your dad an apology, let me know when you've got one"" and hung up on him.

Fast forward to today, about a week since the original incident. I was trying to get a D, so I called my buddy R and asked if he could get anything, he said yeah, so i picked him up and he told me the general area we were going, so I headed there. R and A are pretty good friends even though R is an older guy, between A and A's dad's age, and I had previously told the story to R to see if I was in the right. He said that A is the kind of person that will tell a bullshit story to someone and then brag to the rest of his friends that said person bought said bullshit story, and R said he had heard of A doing shady shit, but A had never done it to him so he didn't care. Anyway, R and I are going to pick up a D, and he tells me that we're going to A's house about half way through the car ride. R already knew the situation between us and said that A said it was fine if i came through. So we get there, and A suddenly starts yelling at me about how shitty his life is since I asked his dad to pay me the $15 he owed me, and starts acting really ridiculous. He started saying ""You want to see how i apologize to little punks like you?"" the way he said it and in the context, I thought that he was fucking with me, and i thought if i said yes, that he'd pull the pill out and i'd hand him my money and everything would be gravy. Instead he tries to pull me out of my car. I locked my door real quick and he walked back around to R's side of the car. After it became blatantly obvious that his ridiculous behavior was in fact, just A being A, I realized I might be in some shit. R didn't realize A was going to do this, so he was as confused as I was. It took me a half a second to realize all I had to do was just be this kid's bitch and apologize to him and just lie through my teeth so i could just get my fucking pill and go, so i did my best to act sympathetic, and he did his best to act like an angry gorilla, and eventually we got to the point where he was like ""Who is this pill for, R? You, or Yolokun?"" R says it's for him and A gives him the pill and we finally get out of there.

Am I a bitch for lying through my teeth and avoiding a fight so I could get my dilaudid, or should I have stood up for myself and fought this guy? He had a bottle of D's on him, so i'm pretty sure if I won the fight, I would have taken those, and that would have just caused even more shit. And I just kind of wanted to rant about the ridiculousness that being owed $15 by a shady douchebag can bring to one's life.

The first pic is 3 bricks (15 buns, 150 bags) from awhile ago of bags stamped ""South End"", not all mine. Average dope, and really inconsistent bags. Some of the fatter bags probably had 3-4x as much powder as some of the skimpier bags. This picture might seem like a lot of dope in it, but because bags are so small, its a pretty reasonable amount. I'd guess each bun has .4g of powder or less in it. Any dope user with a decent tolerance would probably go through all 150 bags within a week.. I hate that the dope around here is packaged like this, because this could easily be just someone's personal stash, but if a cop found it, that person would definitely be charged with intent to distribute... maybe even trafficking charges with that amount.

I have a personal story relating to this topic.  A few years ago I went through surgery to correct, or at the very least lessen, my sinus pain.



My after care in hospital was, or at least what I'm assuming was, hydromorphone.  I was too young to ask specifically what my after care would be, and upon my release I was given 20 Lortab.  I reacted negatively to the Lortab, and my mother was worried enough to call the hospital within the next few days regarding my pain.  The surgeon told her that if my pain was too extreme that I should travel into the ER instead of seeing him for something else.  Not because he couldn't see me, but because according to him, I was making it out to be worse than it was.


Instead, my mom being the saint she is, took me immediately to see my GP.  My GP was appalled at how the surgeon treated me and recognized how much pain I was in, then prescribing me 10mg Oxycodone.  I can't describe to someone who hasn't been in specific pain how relieving proper pain management is.


After this incident I feel shameful or at the very least scared to discuss pain treatment.  I understand I should not feel this way, but after a bad experience it's always on my mind.

I finished my semester at college, made 400 bucks in 3 days, which was my biggest come up for months. Of course, 200 dollars goes to 10 blues, I get two morphine 200s for 15 each, and an eighth of dank for 50 (so spent 280 total on all of that). That stash didn't even last me a week, when earlier in my usage, I could make that amount last a month+.

The most I did was 4 blues in a day the last day, and did it because I wanted to get rid of them and didn't want to do them anymore and just wanted one good final session. This was the first time i've withdrawn, and it's so hard when you have the best connect youve had so far asking you every day if you need any more blues for 20 a pop (im used to a buck an mg since my dealer got arrested), but even through all the pain the withdraw has given me, I stuck through it and got some weed and benzos and stayed in a blanket of sweat for 4 days playing nba 2k and watching game of thrones haha.

I know it won't be easy to stop the psychological desire to feel the warm blanketing goodness of opiates, but having turned down blues while withdrawing for the first time, I feel like I'm moving in the right direction. This is the first time I've actually wanted to stop wholeheartedly, as it has affected relationships, grades, and made myself more slovenly and lazy as ever. I don't scorn or look down on any of you, and wish I could use responsibly and still progress in life as a person, and doing 4 blues in a day may seem like nothing to you guys, but to me it is a huge amount and I look at this summer as a make it or break it; I can either go all out on opiates and spend all my money on it, or I can break away from it and hopefully stop thinking about it one day. I wish I could use inconsistently, but that seems impossible for me. I wish you all the best and will still view this forum occasionally, and hope all is well.",1367887192.0

Nothing like when I just simply snorted stuff from another dealer back in the day. Every time this happens I try a little more because the buzz obviously is not great enough. Next thing I know I'm waking up an hour or two later sitting in my chair. In my experience with nodding off it has NEVER been like this. I at least feel great and slowly keep nodding on and off. This simply puts my straight to sleep and there's no amount of willpower to stop it. Was wondering what your thoughts on this were.

If this is too close to a ""roll call"" type thread that the mods are avoiding feel  free to shut 'er down, but I figured we can just keep things strictly informational and not turn it into the ""meetup thread"" that they're obviously wanting to avoid (for understandable reasons). 

This is mostly for my fellow IV users out there, yes injection of recreational drugs is inherently dangerous but there are many things we can do to minimize the risks we are taking by living this lifestyle. The guide [Getting Off Right](http://harmreduction.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/getting-off-right.pdf) outlines just about everything you need to know about injecting as safely as possible within the boundaries we face as users of street drugs. 

I just had the idea of a thread where we share harm reduction resources for areas we're familiar with, places we've visited or resided in or are just familiar  with through freely available information on them. Speaking for myself and some peers I know outside of Reddit, trying to buy syringes at a chain pharmacy can be intimidating if you don't know if a given location will sell them to you without a prescription, and even if they do, it can be uncomfortable when the clerk happens to be visibly judgmental of your (perfectly legal!) purchase. Logically, it's stupid to let some over the counter awkwardness keep me from using safely but regardless it's a real barrier for a lot of people that should be addressed. 

Many cities have brick and mortar needle exchanges, these are cost-free facilities that offer brand new, clean hypodermic syringes, and sometimes even cookers, cottons and tourniquets. Upon your first  visit, as far as I understand, they will usually also provide an ""up to code"" bio-hazard box for disposing your spent sharps. When you need more rigs, take your box of dirties back to the exchange and they'll trade you brand new ones for your old ones! All without costing you a penny, simply  in the interest of public health, regardless of our lifestyle choices! How Awesome is that. I'll  start by  sharing what I know about an area in a comment, thanks if you actually read all that lol.

**TL;DR : Some people don't know where to get sterile syringes, and some people know where but are nervous about which pharmacies are okay to purchase from. Let's share harm reduction resources, needle exchanges etc. for any area you're familiar with.**",1368010299.0

I'm a realist. I highly doubt I'll never use again, but life is actually starting to not be shitty as it seemed it always would.

You really start to break that frame of mind. And if you give it a chance..in regards to time..I think I'm starting to see that there's a way out. You start to find your passions again. I've been playing music and street performing for cash..instead of committing real crimes.

Since the mid 1990s opiate overdoses have overtaken the number of vehicle accidents in the state of Massachusetts. As a result the number of fatal overdoses began to rise, but this began to change after the implementation of a state program. The program makes Narcan available to not just addicts, but also their family members and friends, those most likely to be able to act during an overdose. The program has been a great success and as a result many people are alive that would otherwise be dead. 

I thought this was an interesting story, and a nice change of pace from the usual posts here.

2. OPs, OCs, or any kind of prescription opiates are becoming extremely rare if not impossible to find in my area. How is availability in your area? In general any kind of high MG oxy is hard to find in these parts. Is it seriously hard to find or the same as normal? have you noticed any drop in availability?

3. I hear rumors that all high MG OC and OP are going away for good anybody else heard that?

4. Another rumor I heard is that a nationwide prescription drug monitoring program is being slowly rolled out across many states and that this will result in a huge drop in the availability of black market prescription opiates. It is claimed that this program sometimes called ""EPIC""will prevent people from doctor shopping. Anybody else heard any claims like this?

5. In general what is the current state of the prescription opiate drug black market where you live? (US only)

I would appreciate your candor and insight, also as I stated in the title I will PM the best answer for their litecoin address. Only interested in those people who are actively involved in the prescription opiate market, not tar or china white.

Ok, so I am beginning to realize that rewarding the response with the most upvotes will be impractical because no one will want to upvote their competitor's posts for obvious reasons! The results would be flawed! So I am tweaking the prize format, yet upping the prize amount because of the quality of responses that have already been posted.

New prizing: 
10 LTC for my favorite response.
5 LTC each for my 2nd and 3rd favorite responses. (So, top 3 responses will receive LTC or BTC equivalent)

Also-- if you have multiple ideas/things you like to do while on opiates, feel free to most multiple times! I am very uncreative and need all the ideas I can get.

EDIT 2: 3 LTC will still go to top upvoted post, on top of new prizing. I am realizing that some posts are defying the odds and being upvoted. So, yes, you with the most upvotes, you will get your LTC.

EDIT 3: Wow, you guys have some really good ideas that I am already planning on trying. Also, alot of your posts affirm some of the things I like to do on opiates, which is refreshing to read! Ok, so I realize that alot of opiate use (especially daily use) consists of sitting around nodding, and thinking of the next score. I get this.. I myself have suffered through the day to day life of addiction, and I fully know how stressful/monotonous daily use can be. But I challenge you to think back to when opiates seemed a little bit more glamorous. Maybe when you first starting using. I guarantee that you have some fantastic memories from your first few uses. I know I do. From playing game after game of Madden, to watching The Human Centipede on Netflix (me and my friends said ""what the fuck"" literally hundreds of times while watching this movie btw), to going to see a documentary of the Hubble Telescope at an IMAX theatre (more wtf moments while watching this beautiful documentary, but communicated it between my friends by more of a ""wtf"" facial expression), those memories will ALWAYS be treasured. I get that daily opiate use can be a curse, I really do. Addiction is a medical condition and can make life REALLY difficult! I myself have suffered withdrawals from daily use and have been to treatment centers myself, but please, for these responses, think glass half full on this and draw from the good 'ol days! I think this is a good thread for the opiate community-- hopefully, others will draw from the using ideas of r/opiates from months to come! Thanks for the sincerity and keep 'em coming!

If you don't know what this is, its HEAVILY adulturated heroin, supposed to be cut with things like quinine to make the rush better for IV users. It is essentially ALL cut, with a very small amount of heroin in each cap. It is meant to be IVed. Each cap has like .2g of powder, but almost none of it is heroin. I don't IV, so I really should be buying ""raw"" (the other form of heroin in baltimore is known as ""raw"" which is just regular street dope... definitely not uncut, but its just typical dope) but all I could get was scramble.

So, I've got these caps, and I've tried snorting 2 so far, and its really REALLY unpleasant. The first one, I got the cap and just dumped it out and blew it straight up. My nose burned SOOO fucking bad, and as it started dripping down my throat, my whole nose, throat, and sinus system felt like it was burning really bad.. I've sniffed molly, 2c-b, methylone, etc. and nothing has burned this bad for so long.. it lasted a good 10-15 minutes before I felt ok.. 1 cap wasn't even enough to get me high, but it burned so bad that I couldn't bring myself to do a second one.


so, I just got home and tried mixing one up with water, and shooting it up my nose like a nasal spray... now, this worked better, but still burned reallllllly fucking bad.

I would plug, but I've had a habit for awhile and I'm constipated so I don't wanna waste the dope because there is shit in my ass...

so how can I consume this dope?

I would just shoot it but I don't have any needles, and I'm having surgery in a couple days and I want my arms to be clean (don't want the doc noticing any track marks or anything)..

EDIT: just plugged the last 3 caps and I'm hoping for the best.. This shit is bullshit, my sinuses/ eye hurts like a bitch on the side where I snorted it most recently.",1368064689.0

How do you cats feel about my writing style, content, etc?","When it comes to getting high, I consider myself an elitist of sorts. When thinking of substances that change the way I feel, I look fondly on a lot of things. Drinking and rolling joints as a teenager, hallucinogens and stimulants in college. I look back on most of the things I've tried and think ""Wow, I was a dumb kid."". There is nothing like realizing how to recognize ones own stupidity. I learned in rehab. I learned a not in rehab, how to functionally stay sober was not one of them. Did they teach it? Absolutely. I just wasn't listening. At the end of the day, when most people lay down to sleep, they think of one of a few things. Work or school, a lover, a family member. When I lay down, I see plunges and rigs. I see an empty wallet and a full bag. Then fast forward to the next day. The bag's empty too, and now so is the wallet. So it's off to hustle, find some way to make it through tomorrow. People often ask me ""Why don't you just stop?"". That's a good question my friend. Let me do my best to help you, the non user who is reading this, understand the allure that is an opiate high. For me, its heaven, especially at first. And well, once you've been to heaven, everywhere else is hell, isn't it? Once you start using more and more, the heaven gets shorter and the hell gets worse. It's so bad, you'd do just about anything to escape it. And when I say anything, I mean anything. Lie, steal, sell your things, sell yourself. Forge relationships with people who are bad for you and ruin the ones with people who actually care. I truly am a tornado in the lives of those who care about me. The smart ones get out before its too late. I'm the best sort of runner. The kinds that makes YOU abandon ME, when I get scared or mad. You do my dirty work for me. I don't even realize I'm doing it. It's like instinct. Eventually, I'm sure I'll do it with everyone around me. How? I'll keep you posted.

I've been using opiates regularly for a legitimate medical purpose for a few good years now. The problem is of course no matter the strength, I take more and more and that ends up in withdraw. The usual spiral everyone knows here. I have a career so I can't really afford to lock myself away at these times. I use 100mcg patches now and while I don't get too many, they work great if used properly. 

Of course I'll have weak points and not account for them and this is whats happened as of late. I chewed through 15 patches in 7 days....  This should not be tried by just anyone and can/will result in death from OD. I ran out but I had my trusty, expensive pod grounds ready to go like every other time. 

I thought I could switch to raw poppy grounds as I always do, but this time my tolerance was way too high. I got to where I puked constantly and it was one of the worst WD's I've been through. I could no longer consume pod grounds and was coming off 12MG + Fentanyl a day cold turkey. 

This was horrific and I used immodium etc the whole period. Fentanyl withdrawal can be quite serious and needs to be met with more opiates or a doctor. 

What's the highest level of Fentanyl anyone's CT'd or came off here? 

Pod grounds are ok but I'm going to plan to chill for a few months after this fiasco. Fentanyl is great for pain too and I would much rather use those as prescribed.

I swing by because I mostly like to check out the 'porn' y'all post, but I also get a kick out of some of your stories of pick ups gone wrong, busts, big scores...hell, just the tales of a junkie, really. 

And that brings me to the point that got me to write this post - I get the feeling there's lots of 'drugstore cowboy' types around here that fancy themselves somehow different than junkies. I can't tell you how many posts I read where these trash-stash sporting, semi-literate, 20-somethings go on slobbering about ""blues"", and at the same time seem to shit their BVDs at the thought of some smack. Little do they know, they're doing the same god damned thing...just paying more for it and getting a watered down high. Shit, am I the only one around here who thinks a wildly overpriced pellet of oxycodone is a little underwhelming? 

My first taste of the dope was over 40 years ago, in the form of a morphine syrette. It was love at first sight, and I've been with the lady ever since. I haven't been using the entire time, thank god, but the addiction has always been there. In that time, I've done some of the world's finest junk, spiked some of the worst bunk, and sampled about every pharmaceutical in between. 

And do you know what I've discovered? Aside from the predictability of the pharms, not a damn thing is different. Yeah, I have my preferences... some buzzes are better than others - but no matter what your opiate of choice, you will always become the same wet, shit-covered, quivering, pile of filth without it. 

So as an appeal to the Roxy 'fan boys' on here...please shut the fuck up. If you need your blues to wake up in the morning, then you're a junky. Plain and simple. And don't let your preferences get in the way of this community's goals of fun, support, and harm-reduction.

Hell, I just saw a guy post on here about not catching a good buzz from oxycontin, but digging on vicodin, and he got downvoted to the pits of hell... for a simple preference!

I'm curious if anyone else can share this sentiment? I know that many, many users on this sub are crazy about Oxy, but I find the euphoria with it seriously lacking. 

So I just picked up 300 mg of Oxycontin (OC formula) after not having done any oxy in about 4 years. I'm a semi-regular chipper who goes on week-long binges every once in a while but maintain a moderate tolerance. My DOC is without a doubt Heroin, but I also enjoy morphine, opium, poppy pods, and hydrocodone. Anyways, my experience with this oxy thus far is that while I definitely get high - pinpoint pupils, itchies, sedation, relaxed body high, etc - I am not getting the blissful euphoria that is precisely WHY I love opiates. I swear I've even found myself somewhat depressed while high on this oxy and that is downright unheard of for me and opiates. Am I completely alone in this? 

I've dosed high enough to start to catch a nod, but even then I am not experiencing any elevation in mood, no contentment, joy....well, simply no euphoria! What is this? I'm the type of user who doesn't really dig nodding very often because I'd rather be awake to enjoy the buzz, and so with everyone saying how ""up"" of a high oxy provides, I figured it'd be right up my alley. However, I'm just not feeling it. 

My memories of using Oxy in the past (admittedly not many times, and it's been a while) were positive, but even then I remember always preferring hydrocodone and morphine. Reading this subreddit I realize that what I just said makes me sound like a heretic and/or a noob, but I swear - hydrocodone and morphine both provide me with a sense of sheer joy and contentment...a profound appreciation for the world around me, and a deep desire to connect with it. And I experience this euphoria and elation even more so with heroin. 

But, oxy? Practically nothing. Shit, I actually found myself getting in a fight with my girlfriend less than an hour after blowing 30mg and shooting another 20mg up my keister. Am I seriously alone in this, or are there others like me out there that do not experience euphoria from Oxy? 

I'd love to hear what you folks have to say on the subject. And before anyone suspects that I'm retarded and am ineffectually consuming what is actually OP type Oxycontin - I assure you that it is in fact the traditional OC formula. I do not live in the United States, and here we do not have the new abuse-proof kind. 

Cheers to all and happy nods.

p.s. good news is I'll be scoring some #4 dope in the next few days so I can put this disappointing experience behind me :) 

edit: If anyone has any advice on how to get the full experience from the Oxy I would love to hear it! I still have 100mg left :/ ",1368244211.0

Well just moved to california and have a diabetic neighbor, she let me borrow a needle and I grabbed 3 of my pills a hour ago 6mgs total and crushed and mixed em.

I could not find a vein for the life of me in my arm and it didnt help my hands where shaking really bad because I'm a pussy and scared of needles.  

Well I took a ativan to calm down and noticed bulging veins in my foot so after three pokes I finally drew blood and shot it up and wow what a rush.  I finally know what you guys have been talking about; and finally feel like I wasnt wasting my pills.

This is the first time I've been completly pain free since I got hit by a drunk driver two years ago and I just really wanted to tell someone.

Normally I'd just tell my twin brother but he died last march.  He kept fighting me wanting to get my pills and I was trying to be legal and not give him any.  Well I hid them and went to sleep and of course he tore the apartment apart and found my pills.  He mixed my morphine with my klonopins and blacked out then drank a half gallon of vodka.

I woke up around midnight to him blackout drunk stumpling around...I was groggy and didnt think to check if he got into my medicine or to check how much he drank because its hard enough getting someone black out drunk to get to bed.  I layed him down on his belly in case he threw up and well the next morning I found him dead with blue lips.

I've lost my identical twin brother, my best friend in the whole world, the longest time we've been apart in over 22 years was 4 months.  My world is shattered and I'm very deppressed and have mutiple anxity attacks a day.

Every night I have the same night mare of finding him and preforming cpr and hearing rips crack and hystericallly calling the police...I sat there holding my one true friend in the world crying until the paramedics pryed him from my arms while I had the worst panic attack of my life.

I feel like I killed my indetical twin my best friend in the whole world.  and now every day is the worst day of my life.

I'm sorry for the wall of text I just had to tell someone I feel like I'm going crazy and the only thing keeping me from sucide is knowing how much that would hurt my family.

sorry for the poor grammar, etc. Typing with one arm cuz of the shoulder surgery..

What's strange is that it seems to work for people with no tolerance who only need a really small amount, but if you need to sniff a significant amount of powder, they don't seem to work.. Makes me think that sniffing a lot of powder makes it gel up and not get absorbed, but small amounts are absorbed..

I learned alot about us opiates fiends!

I learned that we have pretty good tastes. We watch good movies with loved ones and we listen to classical music, jazz and nirvana on vinyl.

I also learned we like to stay active. We work on our golf game, go fishing with friends, and explore nature through hiking and geocaching. We skateboard with headphones, and go on walks with our dogs.

Us opiate users also have a creative side. We draw and write poetry. We compose music and sing to our girlfriends! (Ex-gf now)

We explore the essence of what it means to be human. We verbalize things with friends when we are high, that are only thoughts when we are sober. We look at the stars, searching for answers. 
And as r3discover posted, we ""bask in the hedonistic bliss that fades too quick"". 

And finally, we simply ""chill on the beach and just stare at the waves"". -Milky87

Milky87 is the 10 LTC winner, congratulations! Your post is so simple, and leaves the door open for so much interpretation! I loved the symbolism just gazing at the waves portrays. Us opiate users, more than most others, experience the emotional crests and troughs of life (like a wave). You may be a philosophical intellect of a mind, or you may just be a run of the mill drug addict that was nodding when you posted. But I guess that's what makes us opiate users so interesting!

Also, a big congratulations to pooey_ass, opanasinmynose, and PrioriIncantatum for winning 5, 5 and 3 LTC respectively. Here are their posts.

5 LTC WINNERS

Pooey_ass 

Going to see a movie is an awesome idea, one of my favorites in fact. I really enjoy playing piano in my basement, and since the weather has gotten nice I like to play guiar on my back deck and the neighbors enjoy listening too. Sitting down and reading a good magazine is also great. Although I can't say I live everything about it, rolling stone is kind of fun. Making a light snake of some of your favorite foods while jamming on some cool Netflix series like the x-files, the killing or breaking bad is an awesome way to relax and enjoy the nod. Last but not least, I like to go in the backyard with my pitching wedge and set up a few hoop like obstacles and practice my golf swing. not only is it good practice but it's an awesome way to be active an focused on something, yet relaxed enough to enjoy the euphoria! Some other fun things include fishing, bonfire with friends and the glorious hot tub session on occasion : ). hope you find this useful, and I hope you enjoy your weekend as well, sounds like the great gatsby will be awesome while ripped.

opanasinmynose 

About 4 years ago it used to be that I'd take opiates and get into deep political discussions with people or use all the euphoric energy to do something great for my girlfriend (cool her dinner, compose music for her, etc).

As my use progressed and unknowingly began to NEED the pills, my actions became more and more isolationist in nature. Nights stopped becoming about crushing up those pale yellow hexagonal chunks of happiness and proceeding to be the social butterfly that opiates told me I was. I began spending more and more time leaning on them to numb myself out due to the increasingly messed up shit I was beginning to see took place in my life during my hunt for opiates.

After I graduated to the needle, all sense of opiates being a social drug - one that would bring out my inner musician and allow me to create beautiful works of art, or give me the ability to express just how much I cared about the young woman packing up her things and leaving me that very second - was gone entirely. Now? I shoot heroin to feel halfway alive, this prolonged suicide we call opiate use has robbed me of more than I can ever say. These days I tend to do my shot and proceed to talk to the few friends I have left. Maybe put on a cd, and let the numb waves of warmth and euphoria make me forget - even just for the next few hours - just how messed up these last few years have been.

MOST UPVOTES 3 LTC WINNER (EDIT NoThrowLikeAway was tied for most upvotes, but nobly passed up on the prize)

PrioriIncantatum 

It differs on what kind of H I'm on.
BTH - I like to catch a little nod first, then I like to talk to people, because when I'm on opiates, I just love everybody. I'll lay down in front of the TV and bring my dogs in the room so they can pile on/cuddle up to me (one 100 LB dog, one 150 LB dog, lol.) and just sit there and pet them.
On ECP / Afghan, I get a huuuge burst of energy. I'll clean my whole house, top to bottom, take the dogs out for a run, make dinner for the family, go grocery shopping. I get very active.
Oh, and of course, my favorite opiate pasttime.... FUCKING! Oh yes, it's like an orgasm on top of an orgasm. I could have sex all night long on heroin. And I'm a girl, so I just keep going and going like the energizer bunny. Leave the whole bed soaked. I also like to read and draw, and listen to music, particularly grunge music.
I too love body rubs. Receiving or giving. I just love the feeling of skin on skin and getting a butt ass naked massage lol. And smoking a nice Newport 100. Nothing like it in the world.
Sorry if that's TMI. But I'm nice n opiated and just had to be honest.

What I mean here is, chipping essentially means keeping things on an even keel with life in general and other restrictions- allowing yourself to still be successful without dope coming in between you and that.
 
For me, I fell in love with opiates during probably the worst time of my life for a good year or so-I was diagnosed with testicular cancer. I remember the diagnosis and how it did not really hit me at first. I had just previously gotten over a bout with mono, where odd swellings (my throat had basically a second adam's apple growing out of it) so I did not think much of the fact that my sack was disproportionately large. Eventually it got to the point where there was pain, and it had been too long after it should have gone away so I knew I had to get with the doc. I was thinking of anything and everything but cancer, but when I went this was no uncertainty and there it was staring me in the face. I got treatment fast and luckily was covered (the grand total of costs we incurred i.e. what I would have paid without insurance to not die- were over 350k), if I had not I would have died- no matter what, guaranteed. It is for this reason alone that I will always support the idea of universal healthcare, because had I not been covered fully I would have had to accept an inevitable death at the young age of 20. Despite the uncomfortable fact that I had to give up one of my testes to stay alive (luckily they are kind of like eyes where if you lose one the other just adjusts accordingly and your life is reall not affected too much), I really came out virtually unscathed.

During my treatment, my cancer spread to one of my lymph nodes qualifying it as stage two, this tumor was also conveniently located right atop a major nerve ending. This caused tremendous and relentless pain that only got worse as time went on, with pressure against the nerve always increasing. My main doctor prescribed me 5mg percs for the first time I had ever received them in a bottle of 50x, with no acetaminophen to hold me back, to the protest of his colleagues who did not believe me that I was actually in as much pain as I described and was exaggerating or making it up (nice guys huh?). 

When I started chemo finally, after other methods had failed it took only two weeks for the tumors to subside enough that I was no longer in constant agony (I had the fast growth fast death type of cancer-territoma I believe)- in fact almost all of the pain went away. I still had about 30-40 5 mg oxycodones, and after all of my treatment was handled I began to ""abuse"" because it was fun. Later, I would get hooked up  from time to time through people I knew, but only needed 15mg for a long time to get really fucked up for as much at 6 hours. This pretty quickly moved to needing 30-45 for the same effect, and not surprisingly later found myself exposed to heroin.

These days, I have been really jumping up my H use, which started about a year and a half ago (before only pills, especially my favorite yellow octogons, the rare species that has since died off: our blessed opana 40s). Now I am shooting the heroin as well because it really is so much more effective, with my only worry being that I increase my tolerance too easily and quickly that it makes the idea of really chipping (which I had been successful with snorting/eating pills for 2-3 years) impossible. I love chasing the rush and just got to experience a fantastic one about 15 minutes ago.

My point is, during the most egregious increases in my dosage, I have kept my personal and professional life in check at the very least, and to be honest have blown away the expectations I had for myself and that my family had for me (given U.S. economic climate). I landed not one but two new jobs each better than the last within the last 6 months, with this last upgrade increasing my pay significantly, but more importantly allowing me ultimately the most flexible work environment I could ask for... (40% work from home) as an opiate junkie, not to mention with an automatic pension and high match 401k. All these facts mean that my life is going to be ok almost no matter how badly I manage my money, as long as I meet my 401k contributions and stay working in this cushy arrangement for 10-15 years, an idea that I previously dreaded at other companies.

However, my dosage has still flown up substantially, to the point where I feel like a liar to say I have ""just been chipping"". Opiates have really been good for me to allow me to stay focused in such a laser precision kind of way. I am definitely less fun to some of my friends- partly because I am constantly thinking about ""playing the game"" to get more money/opportunity, and have felt the disapproval big time as they slowly found out the gravity of my drug use (my best friend had a big cocaine ""problem"" in college and despite that he thinks my horse habit is absolutely nuts and selfish- though I have never let it impact him or anyone but me in any way). 

I guess I am making this post because my friends who have found out are saying, ""Dude you are a hardcore drug addict now, you need to get to rehab and understand that you are not in control."" but I just do not feel this way. Despite all odds, I have been annihilating things in my professional career (analyst/software engineer) and am only getting better/establishing even better networks. What can I say to my friends who still can't get past the stigma that H has when the idea of claiming to be a chipper isn't really the truth anymore? Does anyone think I can still consider myself a chipper in the circumstances? Am I heading for disaster and in denial either way like so many of my friends think?

I know I can trust this forum to give me real answers on these subjects, I hope you will

Thanks so much

1ebhq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ebhq9/question_on_tapering/,9,https://redd.it/1ebhq9,crack-cocaine-novice,Question on tapering..,"Basically, I've had a habit for several months. It was mainly heroin for awhile, but lately has been all opana and hydrocodone. Its hard for me to guage my tolerance using the opana as its so iffy as to whether it gets absorbed or not.. 

but, I've been doing my best to take as little as possible lately. This morning, I took a 30mg dose of hydro and have been able to feel it pretty decently...

Not sure if its because I still have opana in my system or if my tolerance is just lower than I thought, but if my tolerance is actually low enough to be able to feel ~30mg doses of hydro, does that mean I should be able to stop without much in the way of w/d's??

I'm not really sure where my tolerance is at right now at all.. I honestly thought it was through the roof considering the amount of opana I've been sniffing, but I'm starting to think that hardly any of it has been getting absorbed, and I've just been wasting my money..

bleh.. either way, I'm planning on coming off within the week. I'm hoping I can taper down with these hydros... then I've got 20mg of methadone and an 8mg sub strip that I'll take before finally going sober..

EDIT: Update:
so I just got a new script for hydros, but again, my parents are holding them (probably a good thing), but they're dolling them out 1x7.5/325 hydro every 4 hours. I took ~10mg of opana around 5pm, and then at 8pm took my 20mg of methadone.

I'm gunna try and go ~24 hours without dosing anything else (well, at least 12 hours, I'll see how long the done keeps me good for). I'm pocketing my hydro doses as I get them so that I'll have a little stash for when I need it. I also have 1 40mg opana left (g74) if I really need it but I'm trying to just lock it away and forget I have it, and come back to it in a week (or more) when my tolerance is lower or whatever.. (obviously that may not go as planned, I'll see how long I can resist after I'm actually out of opiates)

Anyway, so I've taken about 40mg of opana today and I think ~60mg of hydro, then the 20mg of methadone. I'm hoping the methadone will hold me over till at least tomorrow afternoon.. When I do start feeling shitty, I'm hoping by that point the hydros I have will be enough to hold me over.

I haven't got the sub strip yet, but if/when I get it, I'll probably try switching from hydro->nothing, which will probably have me feeling pretty shitty, so I'll supplement in small doses of sub (like .5-1mg at a time) just to keep away w/d's and cravings at first... should be a pretty soft landing I think.

Also, my friend should be getting some 2c-b (one of my favorite psychedelics) and I'm probably gunna be tripping sometime within the week, either before I really enter w/d's, or after I completely come off and have finished w/d's.. tripping has helped me in the past when coming off opiates, I'm hoping this will be pretty beneficial.. and at the very least, it will probably be fun.",1368545682.0

I have large amounts of benzos on hand and was wondering if its worth taking 10-20mg of valium. I'm aware of respiratory depression issues but I want to know if it increases the euphoria or just the sedation. I'm gradually trying to lower my benzo tolerance and don't want to raise it needlessly. 

also, I have some oxycontin in the OC form. It takes me about 240-270mg of DHC to get nicely toasted. 200mg leaves me wanting more.

[x-post from /r/drugs],"Throwaway account. OK - so long story short, I am prescribed 75mg of extended release/sustained release Morphine x4 daily and 15mg Morphine immediate release x2 daily.

I have not been ""stoned"" or ""high"" in years. I've developed that tolerance. If I occasionally double up on my dose, I feel better, maybe a very bit stoned, but not more than a few minutes, but nothing like the hours and hours of being stoned hard in beautiful waves like when I first got hurt and was prescribed Vicodin. So, I miss that, and needles are out.

Is there some way I can smoke my Morphine either by freebasing it or putting it in cigs to get a good high like I used to get? If it helps you understand, the Morphine takes away the pain enough that I can go to work and be OK, but I still feel the back and joint pain. But I obviously miss the high too. If I take extra Morphine, I VERY faintly feel the high for about 10-15 minutes, then I'm sick to my stomach.

I can drink several ounces of Jack Daniels on top of my dose and be a bit drunk, but it does nothing to affect the high. I also have 0.5mg Lorazepam pills. Taking them with the Morphine will knock me out cold, but I get no high.

TL;DR: I take Morphine for a legitimate pain issue, but I miss the high I used to get and want to get it back.",1368491079.0

When I went today, I was not expecting my 'package' to have arrived already, I was just going there to pick up my box key (as they assigned me a box that didn't have an extra copy of its key- I was kinda pissed), and after the nice lady handed me my key, she notified me that I already had a package! She rocked my world! She then gave me the package. In her mind, she was simply handing me a parcel.

Guys, I shit you not, the stealth was unbelievable. I was **really** underestimating these vendors and what ""good stealth"" actually means. The package had a professional business as the return address, and without giving any other information away about my vendor's methods of stealth, lets just say it was insanely inconspicuous.

I've been an addict for a little over a year now. Heroin is my main bitch, and I always, until recently, insufflated exclusively. I believe it was the 26th of last month that I first tried my luck with shooting up. I remember up to that point considering myself an addict but not quite a junkie, as stupid as that sounds. It wasn't until that needle graced my vein with its presence that the term 'junkie' really starting feeling apt. 

Now I've had plenty of moments throughout this year of addiction where I found myself scraping bags hopelessly to try and get any amount of powder together to help relieve at least *some* of my withdrawal. With hindsight I can see I was in a really deep pit of denial, as I was definitely a junkie back then too. 

Which brings us to this morning. Two days sober, barring pot, and I really cant take the heat. My withdrawals were pretty bad off my 3 gram a week insufflated habit. Now that I'm slamming about 3 bags every 2-3 days, its sooo much worse than I thought it'd be. I didnt get a second of sleep last night and I've been sitting here shivering my ass off while sweating like I just worked out for a couple hours. I got together as many used cottons as I could find, about 6 or 7, and started mashing them one by one in 30 units of water. After I got the water through all 7 cottons I filtered it one last time out of a new clean one, in a hope to avoid cotton fever. 

I tied up, I found the nicest vein I could see that had no tracks and I did what I never thought I'd be doing. Shooting up water from my tap thats been ran through several dirty disgusting used cottons. If thats not a good enough reason to call myself a junkie then idk what is. But to my surprise, it did work pretty fucking well and I'm not sick for the time being. I'm not high either, but I'm just happy to not be dope sick.

Im not really sure what my point here was, I guess I just needed to vent a little as I can't talk to any of my friends about this seeing as they only blow dope and find needles disgusting. Am I a fucking idiot? Was that really dangerous to do? I treat every injection as a medical procedure, and I try to stay as sterile as possible.

In my attempts to get high, taken 30mg hydrocodone (CWE), 160mg codeine(in the promathezine syrup). These were not my only doses, just my highest ones. The hydro just gave me a headache, and the codeine did nothing. 

Now, yesterday I snorted a little ECP and felt warm for a out an hour, and then a headache. Had a shot around 6 hours later, didn't feel much but the headache was brought back. Again, I had a shot about 30 minutes ago and I feel a little sedated but I still didn't get a rush, and now I have a headache and nausea. 

Why? This is frustrating and I still have like 6 stamps left. Apparently very good dope, too",1368798637.0

Right now, one of the meds that I take is Roxi 30mg's at 6x a day.  I am thinking about trying to switch to a different med to see if could work better.  right now my plan would cost me these amounts.  

For Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) 8mg 6x day, for 30 days it's around $25.  for Oxymorphone (Opana) 10mg IR 6x day, for 30 days its $100.

No one here is getting pure Heroin. It's all cut. Sometimes it's even cut with something that's active like Fentanyl but  most of the time it's cut with something inactive.... 

But has anyone ever had it cut with something crazy? Like PCP? 

IDK wtf happened tonight, but me and my friend picked up from our normal dude. went to our house. did our shots... and felt good .


At first. Then I left and went home... and started to hallucinate. At first it was just sounds. Hearing shit that wasn't htere.. but then it got heavy seeing things that weren't there... My friend said he started having conversations with people who weren't there.


I've never had anything like this happen. Was our H cut with a hallucinogen ?!  I've never had a bad time on H before but tonight changed that. WTF could've happened? and why would someone do that?

Mostly come on this subreddit when I'm craving pills rather than doing them, but nevertheless I like the community you dudes have developed here. 

So, in two weeks I'm going in for surgery on my hip. Nothing major, just an arthroscopic surgery to repair my hip (I don't have a ball in my socket... the femur bone just sort of sticks in there...). 

Now, I've been using opiates for some years now, but over the past two (when the hip pain started getting really brutal), I fell in love with opiates -- I was introduced by Dilaudid, so quite the introduction if I must say so -- but I digress. 

I'm certainly not a serious addict, as in I have no physical wds (unless coming off a bender of some sort) and can stop using for weeks at a time with (relative) ease. 

HOWEVAH, I have started to develop a bit of a tolerance (again, nothing serious, but it takes about a 30 to get my rox off). 

All of that said, my surgeon has no clue about my drug use beyond what's prescribed to me so my question to you all is how open should I be with my docs? If I keep playing naive, will they keep upping my dose? 

tl;dr -- My surgeon is unaware of my opiate tolerance, so I'm trying to figure out the best way to approach the situation to a)avoid real post-op pain and b) get as many good scripts as I possibly can out of this.

Ive been chipping for over a year, at most 2 / 3 times a week. Usually going for the full on nods of an evening. Only once have broke my never two concurrent days rule with a 5 day binge. 

However, twice recently ive got high during the day - all day and night. Once was at work, and once was a day at the beach. They were both fantastic, the confidence, buzz, focus at work plus the feeling of stealth high. And the time at the beach, with the sun - amazing. This is so good it scares me, I love taking a relatively good hit of #4 with a 20mg morphine tab and a glass or two of wine on a night - nod city and all the blissful zero fucks given that comes with that. However a low dose during the day is getting increasingly tempting. I dont think I could ever IV - needles both scare and make me pass out.

From experience would you guys say during the day usage, if unchecked is a quick way to jumping over that cliff? Im thinking of allowing myself one day a month ontop of the weekend chipping.

And I hope the change won't result in infinite,

From that there is no starting over again.                                                                                               



    But for now I have another chance,

anyway, I can already feel the distinct aweful lunesta taste creeping into my mouth (I've taken this drug a few times, its lilke ambien but gives me a terrible taste in my mouth).. I'm actually feeling pretty good right about now, best I've felt all day.

1ejwpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ejwpj/fentanyl_to_ultram/,19,https://redd.it/1ejwpj,TriedMaLL,Fentanyl to Ultram,"I am wanting to share my thoughts of some popular opiates, alkaloids and amphetamines and my experiences about them.
I started experimenting around 1968. I was first introduced to ""windowpane"", this was when it was really a 4-way hit. I have since been on a road from marijuana to tropane alkaloids and all in between.
Below I will do my best to tell some of my ordeals on the long road of drug abuse.
[marijuana]
In the late 60's the strength of most pot was usually pretty low when compared to todays strains of ""skunk weed"" and various strains of 20 or so percent THC pot. In the early 70's we found that some low grade pot was laced with ""angel dust"" aka: PCP, to get the po to sell better using this additive since the PCP when smoked, snorted, IV'd, etc. has a very strong and long lasting effect. I had a couple of friends unfortunately never come back even to this day due to smoking too much of this laced weed. Like I said earlier pot went through advancements when growers learned cloning, sensimilla production, and strains being imported from abroad, like when you could order pot seeds from Holland. Superior strains of pot were then becoming the norm where one could take 2-3 tokes of pot and get a very nice high. I recall there being to me basically three types of pot highs; the body high, the head high and a mixture of the two. Then in the early part of 2010 was when I first was introduced to the ""potpouri"" type of pot>?>?, this mixture of weed was not at all like what was often referred to as embalming fluid laced pot, but rather contained various types of designer drugs like MMDA and such and some produced trip like highs and other were similar in ways to real pot. Referring back to the 60's, I can remember getting a ""lid"" of pot for 10 bucks, it was usually full of seeds and we used an album to separate the seeds and stems from the flower parts and the usually did bong hits. Today we often pay 20 bucks a gram for some of the more potent strains with names like ""Killer Weed"" to ""Healing Springs"" not to mention about 50 other names I have personally heard.
[tropane alkaloids]
This group of drugs has been in use for getting a buzz since pre-history. In the earliest written records I have found, they were used prepared into teas, oils, etc. and given in very large doses to victoms to be sacrificed in South America before they made their way to the top of a temple mound where they wouldoften willingly allow their hearts to be removed from their body as sacrifice to the Sun Gods and were then typically decapitated, and their heads and lifeless corpses where thrown down the steps of the temple(s). The tropane alkaloids are commonly extracted from species of the Datura Stratamonium or Inoxica Plant, commonly known as Devils Weed or Thornapple. One of the alkaloids found in the plant is Atropine, which was has been used by Opthamologist to dilate the pupils for eye exams.
Another interesting alkaloid containing plant called Sativa. It contains an alkaloi which when smoked produces hallucignations. It is now illegal in most States. The active compounds in this plan are even well understood by people who have xtensively studied the plant.
There are mnay other plants when alone or combined cause certain psychoactive effects. Many, too mnay to discuss here.
[LSD, and relatives of]
Ergot, a fungi like substance whih commonly grows on grasses contains lysergic acid which has been isolated and made into the party drug of the 60's ACID. It produces at does at and below 250 mcg's pronounced psychadelic effects and also auditory ditortions and was was thought to be useful as an anasthethic. Shrooms, Peyote (mescaline) are two other in this group of shc I drugs have been used for recreational purposes for many years. The Cubensis species of ""shrooms"" has been sued for possibly thousands of years and peyote buttons for the same, many may have been surprised that after conuming peyote that about 20-30 minutes after a dose of 1-=20 buttons that violent vomiting occurred then immediately found themslelves in a world of colorful and somewhat euphoric state which did not last as long as LAD but had very similar effects but last only around 8-10 hours. Shrooms can be found growing in the wild in primarily south eastern states in ow pastures after a wet spell, where the peyote prefers a dry climate such as the desert like regions of western Texas and Central America. The buttons are found on a low lying , round cacti.
[opiates]
heroin. horse, smack, china white, etc. is a refined derivative of Thebaine, aka: Opium Poppy. When the flower bulbs are slightly cut they ooze out a milky, thich substance which is gathered and dried and is called opium. It is smoked, brewed and is also refined to make heroin. Most all opiates are derived from opium, where opoids are snythetic near equilivents of those derivatives. The high from pure H is very strong and when abused by IV causes an extremely intense rush, nodding off, and then if followed by a sense of ""all is ok......"" until the high is gone. Then some people will do what is necessary to get that next fix. Morphine, oxycontin (guess we never will forget the purple coffins will we some of us?), roxycodone, codeine, fentanyl, dilaudid are among some of the most popular stronger variants of opium. Then there is the hydros, percocet pain pills which usually have ace' in them to try and prevent abuse. When taken in hefty doses, they can at first use produce a good bit of euphoria and pain relief for the user. I would have to rate fentanyyl as the strongest per mg of the group. Bad thing about these seems to be like a lot of other drugs, they produce paws, or withdrawal, sometimes lasting for days, or until more of the drug is used. In todays society these drugs have reportedly caused more abuse and deaths than illicit drugs, I am speaking of the Doctor prescibed meds, I have peronally lost about 14 friends due to the prescibed opiates and opiod drugs. I would have to say for us, this class of dope is probably the best, seems to produce the best buzz and usually easy to acquire, unfortunately over the last ten years or so the prescription drugs have become very expensive. Pill Mills seem to be the source of most of these drugs and some PCP's who write some of them freely too. I guess that is what brought on the methadone programs of the early 80's in our area, and the suboxone programs of the 90's until today. Years ago it was not uncommon the get subutek, basically buprenorphine, which is the active ingredient in sunoxone, but suboxone contains naloxone and an opoid and opiate antagonist which can send one into withdrawals if they have taken pain killers of most schedule 2-3 types or will wop the effects of op's if the person takes them after they have taken suboxone. The good thing there was about the subutek is that it did not contain any naloxone,,ah ha!
[alcohol]
To us, this was not much unless used with other things, just not a favorite of some. Some like it since it enhances some other drugs effects. We can remeber drinking gallons of beer, etc, when on speed and never getting or at least feeling drunk...lol.
[meth and crank]
Well this is one long lasting buzz. It is made from cold medicine ingredients and the ole' mini thins found at truck stops and stores and they contained on of the most prefered precurser drugs to make meth, ephedrine hcl. It is only one mo9lecule away from methamphetamine hcl. It's buzz can last a couple of days, especially if very pure like ice it is called, we have heard it called shards too. Supposedly ome of the old days biker groups comtrolled the manufacture and distribution of real meth. Takes some chemistry knowledge to make the killer shit, like phosphoric acid, anhydrous ammonia, dry ice, toluene, hcl, acetone, sea salt, some glass ware, the right clothing, time and and a place where the fumes won't cause the nighbors supper to catch fire., lol. Now it is made in a shake n bake one jug method, never seemed to us as good as the old meth. Some people even sell CAT, which only oxidizes one of the molecules of the hydroxyl group of ephedrine, and give a very similar drug. This stuff will rot your teeh out your head and is a great diet, have seen people lose 100 pounds in 6 months from this stuff.
[inhalants]
Well this to us was the pits of all all highs, toluene sold in little bottles to gasoline on a rag to Coleman lantern fluid, glues, denatured alcohol, we thought these were the worst buzz one could imagine, airplane glue I love you...isn't that the way it was once said? shooo oh boy...
[nicotine]
Well we thought we had to mention this since so many people still smoke or chew, but since I was a boy and got a head ruch from a stogie, we don't consider it much a drug for a buzz any way. It sure has casued a lot of people to leave early, that's for sure.

been using all semester (heroin, oxy, opana mainly), at the peak it was probably equivalent to 300mg of oxy a day. Recently I've been forced to take way less. Now I finished my opana about 24 hours ago and have been taking hydro since, but even when I've been able to take pretty large amounts(30-60mg), I still have felt w/d's creeping through..

I took my last (significant) dose of hydro this morning (52.5mg), and from now on I'm completely out of opiates with the exception of 7.5mg of hydro every 4 hours (dolled out by my parents).... There is no way that dose is gunna cut it...

I'm not sure what I should do. I've got 24mg of loperamide, but otherwise I'm completely fucked.. not sure if the loperamide will help, but either way I'm gunna wait till tonight to take it so I can hope for sleep (I'll probably take it along with the small dose of poppy seed tea)

 I was expecting to get some xanny and some suboxone from a friend but he never came through (he says he might have it tomorrow, but at this point its just taunting me)..

Anyway, I am feeling real shitty and want to vent and bitch and moan I guess. I'm really anxious and restless, and also exhausted. I haven't gotten more than 3-5 hours of sleep a day for the past week due to the surgery and shit, even when I was doped up I couldn't sleep.. now I doubt I'll have a chance..

at least I've got some reefer to smoke.

I wish I could just get ANY form of benzo right now.. bleh, whatever.. gunna try to smoke myself into a coma

Some fucking idiot old woman in a big-ass Silverado pulls right in front of me while I'm going through an intersection. I'm immediately raging, light up a smoke and walk across the street where she and her husband stopped. Before I even say a word she starts trying to blame me. Her logic: I ""hit"" her, therefore its my fault. So regardless of any traffic laws  or  common sense, since my front end hit their side panels, it was my fault. I was totally sober, going  the speed limit, and she just failed to yield while making a left. There was even a big ass sign there saying so. Her story of how the event unfolded seemed the same as mine but somehow her conclusion was NOT lol. Anyway, she tells *me* to dial 911 because she's from out of state (wat) and eventually the cops show. Oh btw, while we were exchanging info, ANOTHER accident happened at the same intersection and my car almost got rear ended by one of them. If that happened I'd lose my fucking mind. 

Turned out my car was still drive-able despite looking FUCKED up. My blinkers no longer work, including the rear ones, so I had to signal with my hands like riding a bike on my way to cop lol.

I honestly hate having to take pills, I really do. 800's IBPF don't do shit, along with every other OTC medicine. I've been searching for some alternate medications to take, Kratom works ok, but not like Hydrocodone/Oxycodone. I honestly don't feel the 'high' anymore, I just want the pain to stop so I can live my life as normal as possible. I am always upfront with my Doctor's, but since the 99% ruin it for the 1%, I always feel like I'm being judged by Doctors that aren't my PCM. I can no longer see my PCM, as I have since moved since getting out of the military, and have had 1 visit since moving, and it was terrible.

I was on 7.5/325 Norcos, would take 3-4/day, and my pain level is to the point to where I can't handle it.

Ladies and Gentleman, 

The only thing constant in this existence is change. It's been well over a decade since my earthly passion for the opiate began and well over a year now that it has since departed. In my first moments in recovery, Christmas of 2011, while my joints still ached and my legs still shook, I clung to this subreddit. I shared my story and reveled in the life that I once lived. My war stories were posted with pride and admired by those who could relate. I've met people from here in the real world, though never used with them. As clean as I was, there was something that was keeping me tied to the lifestyle. I didn't want to let it go. I wanted to see people shooting in the tinychat, I wanted to remember my own counter littered with high grade pharma and bags of street dope. I wanted to stay close to you all, because I was afraid I would change. 


Last night I had a dream:

*****
I was running from the cops with a special bag of dope. This bag was assembled by taking a piece of portion of every bag I'd ever bought, collected through the years and had been lost. Until suddenly, while walking by some cops, this bag of chunky, sandy, and colorful heroin appeared in my pants pocket. It was heavy and full. The cops somehow noticed, as if they just turned into Agent Smith from The Matrix, I ran... 


I found myself hiding in a bathroom stall. I was looking in awe of this collection of dope, how it could exist and how high it would get me. I could hear cops running around, somewhere outside the bathroom, but I was going to use it anyway. When I started trying to get it out of the bag an earthquake began! It was shaking so violently there was no way to prep. 


There I was, a collected lifetime of assorted dope, in my hands, and it was spilling out on the floor. All of my years of savings were being lost in an abyss. 


The heartbreak of this was enough to wake me from my slumber. I was so sad. Sad like I was losing family members with each sandy rock that was shaken out of my grasp. Sad that I didn't get to use the substance that I'd ritualistically collected over a decade of use. 

*****

Now awake, I wipe the sweat off my brow, and got up to go to work. I didn't get up to go score dope, I didn't get up and check my phone to see if ""B"" was finally back on, or if ""Q"" was out of jail. But I was forced to think about that little insight from my sub-conscience, and took it as a sign. 


*The collected experience of a decade of drug use, in a bag that I'd been holding on to, even with 17 months clean, made itself known to me. AND I was going to use it. I even tried everything I could to do so, but I was unable to, by the grace of a natural disaster.* 


Because of my fear of change, my fear of becoming someone that you all might not appreciate or recognize, I am holding on to the past. My addiction uses nostalgia as exercise and fantasy as food, to give strength to my almighty ego that, without intervention, would dive right back into the collective parts, pieces and lifestyle that brought me to my place of misery.  


You people, you beautiful human beings who live in that place, the place of my misery, know this! *It is not through collective bias and a community of chemicals that you will find your salvation.* It is through love and acceptance of who you are, without opiates, that will free you from your prescribed slavery! 


This community is part of a cycle of opiate addiction. An essential part of the cycle in which justification of the use of opiates cannot be done on one's own. This is not a problem of just the opiate addict, but of the human ego and the psyche. A conscience or perhaps un-conscience ability to confirm our faulty actions through commonality! However, my good people, if you've found yourself here for that reason, don't despair. This cycle can be deadly, but there is hope for us all. 


Surely you are summing up the rational equations to prove to yourself that these words do not apply to you. That your situation is unique. Most likely you are insulted that someone would have the unmitigated gall to write so generally in reference to a community of nearly 5,000 people. That is fine. I accept that this message likely will not be well received, because years ago I would have been first in line to discredit it. So how could I judge you, when I was you. How could I resent you, without resenting myself? How could I turn my back on you, when I know what redemption I hold now in my heart. The same love that I have now for myself, I have for you. You can do with it as you will, but I give it to you freely. 


I am no longer afraid of dropping my bag of collected dope experience. I am no longer afraid of leaving you and this subreddit. Because no matter where I go, I take you with me. I know your pain, for pleasure, your passion and pursuits of it. I cannot be holier than thou, because I am thou. 


For now, I must heed my call, to life and it's blessings, and to help others who have found it in them to want help. While understanding those who do not. I'll be around today and tomorrow, but anyone who wishes can find me through PM, or /r/opiatesrecovery


Love and respect to you all, you have been a huge part of my life, and hopefully always be part of my recovery.

The thing about it is there's a hole and nothing to throw in it.  Drugs and opiates in particular reveal the mechanical workings of the brain, and the question of motives takes on a particular significance when there's very little energy to parse out...I've been trying to come up with a poetic way to describe my pain, and I can't.  I was standing on my balcony for hours quietly reciting myself poetry while everyone was out having a great time and even if there's no logical reason I can't be like them I can't, for the life of me, ever figure out how.  It's a hole, and it'll still be there when the withdrawals are over and all I'm trying to do is remember what I used to enjoy, and think, well, there's that one thing...what else again?  Oh yeah, a whole big pile of nothing with some sides of sit down and shut the hell up, and while you're at it thank jesus for being in America and having a job and not being crazy or deformed or stupid.

In the past week I tapered down from using who-knows-how-much opana to being able to get well off 7.5-15mg of hydro.

15mg actually has me pretty comfortable, even lightly buzzed.. but, if I try to just take 7.5mg, I usually still feel kinda anxious and restless and shit.. Its weird, I'd think with such a low habit, I wouldn't w/d, but if I go ~6 hours without dosing then I start feeling shitty.. noticeably restless legs and anxiety and shit.

so, is this just in my head? Or what? Should I just continue to taper down to 7.5mg doses? 

I dunno, I just really wish I could sleep. I no longer need the hydros, I'm gunna talk to my doc tomorrow and see if I can't get rid of my hydro script and get a small xanax script.. I'm not in much pain, I just can't fucking sleeeeeepp.. ugh

After having nothing for 2 days I was over the hump of w/d which I don't get that bad anyways. But anyways I took 50 mg of done every 24 hours and I felt great. Like the old school motivated feeling I haven't had in a long time. I originally started on pks because I have broken 40 bones in my pro bmx career and my body is shit. Over the last year that motivated feeling I got from pks is gone. My last major injury a few months ago of a broken heal took me 400 mg to even start to help the pain. My questions are this. I haven't had anything except a couple .25 zannys that my girl gets but doesn't like. I feel pretty good, accept my body feels like shit with pain. Am I completely over the hump? I guess I'll know for sure in the next day or 2. Second, is the reason pain killers don't work any more is because I never let them wear off any more? They just make me depressed and unmotivated in the last 8 months. Finally my most important question, what mg does methadone come in from the pharmacy in minneaota? I read some where 40mg. I want to ask my doctor (who also owns a methadone clinic) to put me on the 8 instants/day and 80 mg of done/day. That's still under the 360 mg of oxy I was on a day.",1369012482.0

Any insight?,Ok ive used opiates daily for about 5 years give or take and have had some clean time in between. Both cold turkey and suboxone detoxes have worked and usually dont last as long as others say possibly due to my fast metabolism. Well a few days ago i came up on a full script of sub films so i decided to due a semi-long sub taper(2-3 weeks whatever i needed). After about 2 months of a 1-2 bun a day habit i took 8mg about 18 hours after my last dose(i get sick faster than most i wanted to take it sooner). I felt much better so the next day i took 2mg in the am and 2mg at night. Next day was 1 and 1. Now the fourth day rolls around and i was bored and fiending. I said ya know what i have the time and means this wont hurt anything im taking 16mg to see if i feel anything. About an hour later i got a slight mood lift but was otherwise disappointed. I told myself i would just taper off right from now on and i wasnt taking an more until i was actually sick. This is the interesting part. That 16mg dose was about 3pm saturday. Here i am tuesday at 4:48pm a good 72 hours im feeling fine. I even slept 6 hours both nights. This blows my mind because i usually feel shitty if i dont dose atleast every 24 hours and i usually feel normal 7 days after subs not the ususal 10-14 i read about. In fact the worse symptom for me coming off subs everytime i the 3-4 nights of no sleep and RLS but ive yet to have either. Can anyone explain this i dont even know what to think i feel about 90% normal,1369169566.0

I've been using mostly oxycodone 30's for around 2 years but open to anything (meaning fuck it, tar sucks but whatever.)  I've been much much worse off, but currently I do about 90 mg twice a week.  I live in a smallish town so no real chance to cold-cop.  Nearest large city has less than stellar reputation for both H market and quality and it seems weird to wander around and try to buy pills.  

First middleman was terrible so hooked up with dealer directly.  Dealer was slightly less terrible, but she got popped and started setting up controlled buys.  Was lucky to have been broke for the 2 days it took everyone to figure that out.  Scrambled through some truly shitty middlemen until I found a halfway decent one.  Good guy, kind of a shitty middleman but he was reliable enough and a decent guy.  

Just got a text from his girl saying that they are going clean but with a couple of her hookups because I smoked him out and wasn't sketchy.  The last middleman and his girl are getting evicted and shit and I knew they were having pretty massive issues.  His girl is also the one texting shit out and she isn't asking me to not contact him, but just to not hit him up for pills.  She actually said it would be good for me to hit him up to hang out sober as he doesn't feel like has too any actual friends who don't just use him for drugs.  So, given that I'm going to wait another couple days to make sure that noone else that went through him gets popped.  Just to make sure his connects aren't controlled buys but I could sure be a whole lot more sketched by the situation.

So, given all that background, i'm wondering at what point do I decide that the possible LEO involvment, sketchy middlemen, and shitty dealers are just too much and switch those for new and specific online bullshit?  

I don't have a daily habit anymore, so I can evaluate this a little more rationally.  I can likely get a much better price local than i was getting with the 30's (if the contacts are legit and not a setup,) but is H so much cheaper that it would still be a savings to go for overpriced online H?

Has anyone switched out of anything but absolute necessity?  How do you like it?

Thanks in advance for the input.

TL;DR: Is it nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of a thousand shitty middlemen and connects for 30's, or buy H online and by doing so never being able to say where I got my drugs with a straight face?",1369161476.0

I take my methadone as I should and have not done any other substances. It would be totally pointless for me to do any opiates especially because, obviously, I wouldn't feel them. 

A couple of weeks ago I took a drug test as usual. But, this time it came back positive for opiates. Of course, I was like wtf and told my counselor I haven't done anything. I'm sure they get that all the time, and who are they going to believe, a former junkie or a drug test? Exactly. She gave me the option to get it sent back for confirmation of what exact opiate it was. I knew it had to be some sort of mistake. My husband and I were racking our brains trying to figure out what on earth could have caused it. Then, he reminded I had been eating almond poppy muffins. I had eaten an entire package of them.

Upon remembering this, I researched about failing drug tests for it, and it said they would show up as morphine. I told my counselor it had to have been the muffins. She looked at me basically like there's no way in hell that could've happened. Fast forward a few days later and my confirmation comes back, it's positive for morphine.  

Because of this, I got dropped down a phase for 30 days, meaning I lost one take home dose a week. She said she would discuss it with the doctor, but I know it's not going to make a difference. The thing I hate the most is being made to look like a liar, because I know they don't believe me, no matter what I say.

The taste was disgusting though. What gives?

2) I have used opiates less than 20 times in 5 years, but each time I do they make me feel ""like I should."" Meaning, aside from my job, relationships, humor, enjoyment, etc... I am not a happy person and I know how to be... but when I am under the influence I remember what happiness was and can see how to get there, but also see the road that this leads to..do you guys feel like that? Is THAT the feeling? 

3) So, I want to use responsibly. Any suggestions? I mean, I want to use them..to benefit me, whether it be to go out and meet strangers, or sleep really really really well.

He normally preps his dillies and other pillies by putting them inside of a straw and chewing it to get them to a fine consistency, but when he did that today the straw cracked and split, then powder. went. everywhere. It was a sad state watching a grown man cry. I know all too well being sick and losing your meds is the worst feeling, because of how got damn close you get to being well.

Anyways here is my method to get them to a perfect consistency and I wanted to share to prevent anything like this from happening again.

1.) fold a dollar bill in half (hamburger style for an elementary school arts and crafts throwback)

2.)place the pill in between the folds of the bill

3.)opitonal but good for retaining every last bit of powder- fold over the edges so the bill forms a pouch around the pill

4.) take something smooth and rounded to crush the pill, and grind it like one of those ""etching a leaf under a peice of paper, using a crayon"" drawings. For roxies and softer pills I use a bic lighter and for harder pills like opana IR's I usually use a beer bottle.

5.) unfold the pill and scrape it all off onto your surface of choice.

6.) Try and figure out the rest.

Here's my question. Does one need to get 100% juice not from concentrate such as Simply Grapefruit, or White Grapefruit Juice FROM concentrate such as the Ocean Spray brand?

I've read threads where some people suggest this or that. One person said that FROM CONCENTRATE is the best because he/she claims that more of the active ingredients that blocks the Cytochrome P450 enzyme are found in juices that are from concentrate rather than not from concentrate. 

I am just a bit confused? I always thought 100% NOT from concentrate would be better. I have a low opiate tolerance and I want to try grapefruit juice with 20-30mg of hydrocodone. I have the 10/325 yellow V 3601 pills. 

What are you thoughts or personal experiences with these things. Has anyone here tried concentrated vs non-concentrated juice and if so, what were your thoughts on the two?

Over the years I've noticed that most, if  not all opiate addicts (heroin in particular) like to dabble with meth. Now, the tweakers I have encountered are a different story; they all seem to HATE heroin and any other opiates.


I've never been particularly interested in meth, but am never able to resist when it comes around. I think it's because I am just fascinated with blowing Snoop Dogg clouds. When I was dopesick, people would offer me meth as a way to feel better. Now I don't know about y'all, but it never made me feel better. I'd just lay awake for days, acutely even more aware of the pain. When I do meth, I can't eat and I can't sleep. I've noticed that people who use meth regularly CAN eat and sleep, but I just can't.


Anyways, I was wondering what the correlation was and how many of you opiophiles also indulged in meth. Why do you like it? What does it do for you? And most importantly, why do us opiate users embrace meth as another recreational drug when most tweakers won't touch our DOC with a ten foot pole?

EDIT - Just to clear it up, I live on the West Coast. I think meth is more common here. Back when I lived in the dirty South it was mostly crack as far as people using stimulants went.",1369337473.0

I've Ben a chronic pain patient for almost 3 years now due to an autoimmune disorder and worked my way from just hydrocodone, to oxycodone, epidurals, physical therapy, morphine, and most recently fentanyl 50mcg and Oxycontin 30mg x 3 daily. I have been tapering of my
Fentanyl patch as I want to be on jus one medication for pain, and in my past experiences with Opana have been amazing. I do like to experiment with opiates more than the average person, but I don't let it get ""out of hand"" and I haven't run out a prescription early in a long time. Basically I have an amazing doctor who allowed me to basically choose any pain medication to take, as long as it was an extended release medication. The cost of my medicines each month were high, and when the generic Oxymorphone came out, he was more than happy to make the switch for me. I was surprised to find out that he wanted me to take the 40mg Opana 2x daily. 

I have, over the last month, tapered from 50mcg to 12.5mcg of fentanyl, and still the 30mg x 3 Oxycontin. My question is, based on your previous experience, what should I expect from my dose of Opana? When I got moved from the 12.5mcg patch straight to the 50mcg patch, it wrecked me for three days straight before I evened out. Will I be looking at the same thing here with the opana switch?

Fuck.

I just rubbed a little on my gums and they are numb. WTF. I've used this vendor before but this is the first time I've bought M 30s. There is oxy in these, my itch went away but it lasted like 30 minutes and I'm sure most of that high was from coke and MDMA. 

I flushed the fuckers as soon as I tested them on my tongue and gums.

That just scared me straight. I'm messaging the vendor in case he has no idea, I've bought fantastic pills from him before so I'm not jumping to any conclusions.

As i'm a MMT patient.

After having a big Pharmaceutical / Heroin IV habit.. and needed a break from the game. 

So just before i dosed I had:
4 x 150mg Lyrica (Pregabalin) - Prescribed 2 a day
5 x 5mg Valium - Prescribed 4 a day. 
anywhere from 150-200mg approx (As i obviously didn't have time to measure i just poured it quickly into my cup) of Methadone

The only times I've ever taken opiates I can count on my two hands. 

Here's the breakdown:

Summer of 2012, took about 150-200mg of Tramadol. Didn't feel SHIT until I smoked some weed about 5 hours later and then it hit me like a truck. Best nod I've had to date...weird, though, it only worked after I smoked weed and that was 5 hours after I ingested the pills

Codeine and Promethazine Syrup:

Took 30mg's of Codeine in January of this year 2013. ~5 months ago

Took ONE Watson 10mg/650 Hydrocodone from a friend about 2 months ago

Then took another 30mg of codeine about a month after taking the Hydro and a week after that took about 60mg of codeine 

And I haven't touched an opiate since until now...

I bought 10 of these generic Norco 10/325 

http://www.drugs.com/imprints/v-36-01-10135.html

I at 2 the first time...just felt lazy...a few cramps and some nausea. Empty stomach

Then about 2 days later I decided to crush and eat 2 again, then an hour later I ate another tablet...still nothing...so That's a total of 30mg of hydrocodone...All i felt was nausea...then about 2 hours later I decided to smoke some weed and that made me feel a bit better

Did I just get some bunk pills? I felt the single Watson pill my friend gave me about two months ago but nothing from these except nausea.


Now I have 5 left and I sort of want to just take all of them. I read in another forum that someone thought the yellow norcos were crap too for some odd reason while others liked them...?....I just thinking these pills were just bad. I feel no physical effect from the pills except nausea and I feel like smoking a bowl of weed gives me a better physical and mental high

The previous times I've taken opiates such as with the tramadols, codeine and the Watson Hydrocodone I felt pretty good. But with these yellow norco's I hardly felt anything. I thought I was gonna get floored with 20-30mg of Hydrocodone but it was a major disappointment

1f3ak7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1f3ak7/suboxone_faq/,31,https://redd.it/1f3ak7,KickerS12X,Suboxone FAQ,"I want to compile a list of FAQ about Suboxone that will hopefully be posted in the sidebar. I see multiple, seemingly simple, questions pertaining to Suboxone every week. If you have something to add, feel free!

Suboxone is a brand name drug manufactured by Reckitt-Benckiser that is a combination of buperenorphine and naloxone in a 4:1 ratio. It is a moderately powerful semi-synthetic opioid that is most commonly used as a maintenance medication for people that are opioid dependant. It is the preferred medication for maintenance treatment because it is only a partial agonist and doesn't have all the awesome euphoria associated with most opioids. It also has a ceiling effect that keeps people from just upping the dose through the rough and getting high like with methadone.

**What is Suboxone prescribed for?**

Suboxone is indicated for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence. You can be on a taper, and be off in a month, or for the rest of your life. Most people that succeed using Suboxone are on it for over a year. In this year you have to learn how to live and it gives you time to find other things in life that you enjoy that will take the place of the drugs. It helps to curb cravings in many people.

**How long should I wait to take Suboxone?** 

You should try and wait until you are starting to feel moderate withdrawals if at all possible. If you take it too soon the *buperenorphine* can cause precipitated withdrawals, not the naloxone, due to it having such a high affinity for opioid receptors. You are generally good to take Suboxone 24 hours after your last dose with most opioids. The one exception is when you are on methadone, especially high dose, long term methadone maintenance. Methadone has a half life of up to 70 hours! It can take 8-15 days, when you have been on long term methadone, for the levels to be low enough for you to safely take Suboxone without causing precipitated withdrawal. 



**How long do I have to wait to get high after taking Suboxone?**

Buprenorphine has a really long half-life, so it occupies your receptors for quite a while. Bupe has such a high affinity for your opioid receptors that most other opioids can't ""knock it off"" to occupy the receptors and give you their effects. I find that you can get high from your normal dose after about 24 hours. You can still do a much higher dose before this and achieve some affects. If you do take a much higher dose to achieve a high, remember that the majority of the negative side effects of opioids are still there. [Even though you don't feel high from your DOC, it could still lead to extreme respiratory depression resulting in death. So if you normally wouldn't take the dose off of Suboxone, don't do it when on Suboxone to try and get high.](http://buprenorphine.samhsa.gov/CESAR_FAX_21-46BupRelEDVisits.pdf)

**How much should I take?**

Most of the time 4mg is the highest dose most people need to get by. When you first dose it, you might need up to 8mg, but that is it. I find that the best dose to actually maintain on is around 2-3mg just once a day. With bupe, less is often times more.

**Can I swallow my spit, or the strip/pill?**

Suboxone is designed to be absorbed sublingually, or through the bottom of your mouth. Bupe has the highest bioavailability, aprt from IV, when administered this way. You should try to keep the film/pill under your tongue, without swallowing for at least 7-8 minutes.

**Can I get high on Suboxone?**

If you have anything above a hydrocodone tolerance, the answer is most likely no. If you do have a very low tolerance be careful with the dose. Start out with 1mg, maybe 2mg, and take it slow. I would also advise you to snort the dose that you are taking, it makes a huge difference. The reason that snorting is more effective is a combination of increased C-MAX (maximum blood plasma concentration) and decreased T-MAX (time to peak blood plasma concentration). Yes, the bioavailability is lower, but the two things I mentioned play a much greater role when trying to use buprenorphine recreationally. It takes about an hour before you really start to feel anything. There is a fine line between a puke fest, and a good time.

**What is the naloxone for?**

The naloxone is pretty much pointless in Suboxone. It seems as if they threw it in there so that they could have a patent on their own medication. It is such a low dose that it doesn't even deter people from IV use. The bupeprenorphine is what cases the precipitated withdrawals and the ""blocking"" affects.

**Why take Suboxone?**

Many people use Suboxone differently. Some use it as a stop gap in between doses of their drug of choice. This keeps them from having to experience the cycle of withdrawals when money or drugs are not available. Others use it to stay off of illicit or abused substances all together and may be on it for a long period of time. The people that take it everyday at regular doses do so to help curb cravings, and it does work quite well for this for a good amount of time. There is no ""best"" way of using subs in my opinion. It is whatever works for you.

**Is Suboxone hard to get off of?**

It is no harder than any other opioid to taper off of if you play it smart. You need to taper your doses slowly over a period of weeks. If you taper correctly you should feel almost no physical withdrawals at the end.

Some of the tar I've bought in the past has shattered when pressed on the counter just above. There HAS to be fragments somewhere. At least this was my mindset. I had my face to the filthy linoleum, poking deep in the crevices. I had a small headed screwdriver in hand to push away bug carcasses, food crumbs and god knows what else. Anything and everything that even remotely fit the description made its way into my spoon. As all ingredients chosen were of the brown/black variety (BTH has been my main purchase), the water colored itself correctly and a'cookin I went. I have no fucking clue what just found its way into my veins, but it damn sure wasn't what I was looking for. the story doesn't get any more exciting. The shot didn't make me sick or grow a third nipple (no offense to my tri-tipped brethren), it just filled me with shame. Is this what I've become? Since I've moved back east, I've only geared up via SR. I'm too unfamiliar with the area and clueless these days to the art of finding sources from scratch. SR has been reliable. Expensive, but reliable. I have to leave for a biz trip this weekend, so I intentionally used up my stock a cpl days ago. Leaving enough days to get past dope sick and be able to function. Seemed like a good idea at the time. Hell, maybe it still is. I just can't fathom how something that once upon a time was a well controlled, occasional habit has lead to me searching high and low for anything I can cook into just one more shot. My personal life imploded nearly a year ago now. I refuse to drink as I can't handle the levels it takes my depression to. Dope has been the only thing to take the 'sad' away. Now it's become a component of it. I don't think I have a point, sadly. I just needed to get this out. I'm losing hold and grasp of who I thought I was. It's easy to lie to yourself throughout life. Justify or explain away your mistakes and bad choices and forge ahead in an ignorant bliss. When you're cooking up crumbs and bug shit (just spitballing here) to get just one more hit, there's a reality and a visual now that you can't forget or deny.

That said, I am not even sure if that is what one feels if they are OD'ing. Are most people even aware that it's happening? Is it almost instant or can the OD occur after the rush?

Its been 8 days since I took that last dose of hydro, ~13 since my last dose of opana (20mg sniffed, which, due to my habit, wasn't a very high dose to me and barely got me high), and been probably at least 21 days since I've had any herion.

I've got my appetite back and I'm shitting normal again and everything, but I just still feel like shit...

I've been taking xanax, which I guess is important info, but if anything I feel that should be lessening these feelings..

I don't get why I feel like this. This is only my second time ever quitting after a long habit, and last time it only lasted like 5 days.. I don't get why I feel so shitty.

also, due to a surgery I just had, I can mainly only walk for excercise or ride an excercise stationary bike.. maybe if I start excercising more I'll feel better?

**Back story:**I am a chronic pain sufferer in pain management.  Although my pain is legit, I am also an addict and have been for 18 years and I did not tell my doctor as I thought that I could take my meds as prescribed.

I *did* take them correctly for about a year, then I started abusing pretty bad in the Fall.  I burn right through my monthly scrips in about 10-15 days, then I supplement my habit with street priced oxy, morphine and hydrocodone.  I am prescribed 3x30mg Morphine ER daily and I *was* on 3x10mg oxycodone daily until a few months ago when I asked to be taken off of it (this took so much courage and will power) because I was abusing it bad.  I managed to not tell them I was an adict still even though I fucked up the pill count.  They replaced these with 3x15mg Morphine IR.

Ok, so I realize that I am a hopeless addict and that my meds just cause me problems.  So in my last appointment I asked to switch over to subs.  I am scheduled to switch over to subs a week from today (next friday).  

**But here's my problem:** I burned through my meds again and all I could find was methadone last week.  For some reason I didn't realize that the half-life built up exponentially.  I took ""enough to get well"" every day for the last 6 days which was anywhere from 70-90mg a day.  I know, guys, I fucked up.

So I took my last dose yesterday afternoon, I have 20 Norcos for today, then I managed to buy and set aside 2x60mg Morphine ER's per day until Wednesday.  **My first question is am I going to be really fucking sick going from that methadone dosage to the 2x60mg/day morphine?  When do you think it will start?**  I don't feel sick yet, which scares me.  Am I looking at a full blown calling-in-sick-to-work kick?

**My other big problem/question is that I will have to take a piss test next Friday morning when i go in to get on Subs.  Will the methadone still show up in my system?**  This is really the most important issue for me.  I am a hopeless addict who has an out of control habit.  I really need to go on subs and testing positive for done will fuck up my pain management contract.

TL;DR I took 60-90mg of done per day the last 6 days in a row.  I need to know if i will be able to pass a piss test in a week.  Also, curious when major w/d's from the done will start and what I'm up against.

I realize this is a long post, but the internet has conflicting info on done.  I'm really freaking out over what I might be up against.",1370006423.0

I am high on heroin as I type this. Some thoughts.,"Okay, long story short is I found this subreddit, began reading, began fantasizing, and then decided to pick up. I am high right now and guess what? I love it. Am I fucked?

I feel so strong at this point that I might be able to chip, or use occasionally. I mean I could stay clean for 2 years, why couldn't I chip? Do you all think I can control my use to not get physically dependent ever?

Part of my logic was that some of you guys pay like 200/gram for H and seem to love it. Some of you even convert 200 bucks into Bitcoins, give that money to some random dude and hope he mails it to you through the postal service. You jump for joy when your overpriced G of H comes in the mail a week later. Even though your high costs you 25-50 bucks each time, you still love it. And even though you have to go through all that bullshit, you continue to do it.

I live very close to Mexico and can get grams of fire ranging from $30 to $60 each (you can't even find it for more than $70, no matter what). That means I can get very high for very cheap. To me, when I see people paying so much for so little H in their bloodstream I feel like I am almost obligated to get high. I mean, I love that shit. We all do. It feels so good. Better than anything reality can provide. Losing my virginity didn't even come close.

Am I a fool to think this way? To think that if someone will pay $50 bucks to get the same high I can get for $10 then I should be getting high by default? I mean if it's worth $50 to them and we both love it, why wouldn't i do it for $10? I mean I do love it. I am in no way trying to dog on people that use SR or pay higher prices. Most of it goes through Mexico and I happen to live near the border in Cali. It is for each person to decide what that feeling is worth to them.

But if everyone in Afghanistan shared my logic they would all be full blown needle wielding junkies. So, am I moron? Am I just experiencing addictive thinking? Or do you think that my ability to remain clean for 2 years and get so much good H for so cheap makes it a given that I should enjoy this wonderful drug? If I can manage to chip and only use twice per week while getting $30 per G, that sounds perfect to me.

I've done a little digging but have turned up some different answers and figured you guys would know all about it.
I've got a few questions:

-With Grapefruit juice should i begin drinking it 4 - 5 days before I plan to dose?

-Is there a rule of thumb with how many mls of Juice per mg of oxy? (Say I would drink 500mls per day if I was going to take 40mg oxy?)

-Can it be bad to mix multiple potentiators together, are there certain ones to never mix?

-What are your guy's routines for potentiating oxy? Like favourite combinations, etc?

-The more potentiators I take, the harder I nod. Would that be true? Sorry if it's a stupid question.

If it makes any difference, I'll be sniffing half an OC80. And haven't had any other opiates for about a month.

So I've been using PST for the past couple months, and it's been excellent.  Good times.  Cheap, mild high, all that fun stuff, despite some of the downsides [drinking all that swill, long onset time, etc, you all know the drill].  However, I went on to Amazon to find that the two brands I know to be reliable off them have been removed from the site at their normal sites.  They still exist from other vendors, but at twice the price [or higher], and aren't eligible for free Prime delivery.

Needless to say, I was fucking bummed out.  But it got me thinking.  I've been seeing a lot of public discussion of these particular brands and their off-label uses, both on this forum and on others.  And I can't help but wonder if perhaps we've been a little cavalier?  I mean, if we want this to be a sustainable thing to enjoy, we probably need to be a little bit more hush hush about which brands we're using.  

I mean, I'm pretty sure no one was calling to *complain* about the quality of the product being sent out, so they must be under review because someone tipped them off to how their being used, right?  I mean, fuck, you could just look at the reviews and it's *obvious* that some posters are talking about getting high off of it.

I don't wanna see this option dry up, and I know you guys don't, either... And I know we can't do anything about the Amazon reviews, but perhaps we oughta have a discussion about seed sourcing?",1369945660.0

Then i moved to Vegas and had to get all my shit up to the 3rd floor of my apartment, when that was done i was in such severe pain i went straight to a walk in clinic in which they gave me a shot of dilauded(sp?) and a script for 60 percs until i could get into a PM doc..

So i get in with the pm doc and he started me out on morphine 15s, then 30s, then we switched to oxy 15s, then oxy 30s. The pain finally went away after i would take 2 of the blue oxy 30s. so 60mg every 3-4 hrs.. 

My script wouldnt last very long that way, so he put me on a long acting one, and once again, tried morphine SR, oxycontin, opana.. nothing worked.. I finally got some pain relief when he gave me the Fentanyl patch.. started at 25mcg, then going up to 50mcg.

for the past 4 months i've been on 50mcg fentanyl changed every 48hrs, along with 4 to 6 30mg oxyIRs per day.. 

I've also had 3 rounds of injections in my lower back so i think its getting better now.. 

The problem is, i dont know if my pain has gone away and im better now, or if the fentanyl is masking the pain.. Im terrified of withdrawls and i've heard that fentanyl WD's are teh WORST and can last up to a month..

Descriptions of the many I've come across as a warning/guide"," I know this is super long, but hopefully it can help you from getting burned sometime or find out if those weird perks you have are fake or not!

So I've run into fakes before, and I've gotten very good at spotting them and not getting burned. There have been a lot going through Philly. My normal connect usually gets half his from legit scripts, and half off the street when he runs out, where he is much more likely to get these fakes, but since we know each other pretty well now he will usually take back fakes on the very rare occasion they pop up in my bag. 

The first time I got takes, they were m boxes and super hard. Basically just like chalk, chalky taste, no effects, super hard with a super deep imprint and all white. When you broke them, it shattered, and looked like small, white fingernail clippings. At that point I was too new to opiates to know any better. 

The next time I had gotten a bag from a friend of a friend, where my buddy middlemanned and I didn't get to see the bag till the dealer drove away, in my bag of 8, I had 2 fake m boxes that were sooo soft, definitely not made with a real pill press. While the other pills I mention seem to be made in the same fashion, with the same substances, this one seems thrown together by a real amateur. They were also smaller , and when I put it in my mouth it just melted away. I didn't notice these since I just popped one when I woke up with w/d not able to sleep one night and just popped one to get some sleep and it did nothing. Sucked. 

Third time, with my new connect who took them back, I got a bag of ten fake a 215s. They were a lot better than the previous ones. Perfect size, and very close imprint although the text was skinnier and rounder at the A. The other part that was slightly off was a raised rim/lip around the edge of the whole pill like it was made from a cheaper mold/press. It was super hard, really had to break it hard under a card, or wrapped in a bill and smashed it with something. When this was done, you could see the outer shell was white and broke up glass-like and sorta shattered. The inside was more like the normal powder, but it was blue. Overall I'm pretty confident they were benzos; they tasted a bit sweet and felt like benzos with the dopey head high and potentiating my oxy high. All the fakes so far I could definitely tell are fake on sight.

Today was a whole different story! I got wind of a great deal from a friend or mine who also picks up for me sometimes and is always legit. He had a guy he knew in a bad area he works in and picks up from a lot offer him 25 for 385. He already picked up so he offered it to me and took the guys number. He put up the money to get them for me , and we were both sketched out at te price but he really looked at them hard and they were almost perfect. They were blue v's and on sight you wouldn't be able to tell that it was take. He said he licked the edge of one and it tasted good and they looked perfext so I was relieved. When I grabbed them and brought them home, they looked perfext to me too, they were hard, but v's usually are, and they weren't as hard as the other fakes, they seemed pretty normal. When I snorted it though, definitely didn't give me the same reliefs as a normal 30. It burned a tiny bit and dried out the back of my throat with the drip which was different. I have a very high tolerance, so taking one wasn't enough to really tell by effect whether or not I had an oxy high. I looked at it again, and it looked so real I was doubting myself. It seemed like it was made of the same thing that was inside of the fake A's, that blue powder, but instead of wrapping it in a white shell with an a or an m logo, they just made it a v which seems a lot more simple and sensible. When I broke it up and really grilled it, it did break up more like a harder fake, it wasn't too hard, but It broke into smaller and smaller pieces rather than pure powder like a real 30. After a couple I sort of felt the benzo high, and I tasted it and it had a sweet taste; however, there was a bit of bitterness to it, so I can see why my boy would be confused. It definitely was more of a sweet taste just like the fake a's I had. After a few my dry throat had a bit of numbness to it, and there was a bit of white powder, although very little, in each pill which was definitely a tiny pinch of coke. Idk if it was the coke, or if there was a tiny bit of real oxy, or if it was kept in a bag at one point with real 30s but there was a hint of bitterness to it. I guess the idea was to take cheap benzos like the fake as and put a little coke in there to make it mimic an oxy rush. 

Trying to return these if possible tomorrow but I'm probably stuck with them unfortunately. Just a warning to everyone about what the many I've come across look like, what the fakes taste like, and that they're getting a LOT better. Sight isn't enough anymore! If I have to meet a new connect now, I'm gonna just buy one and eat half and snort half, and if its all good, then ill buy what I want. At least the good fakes seem to be made with the same strategy and fillers, maybe even from the same source. From the first I've seen, hard ms, to hard A's with benzos, to hard vs with better color and benzos with a bit of coke, it might be the same people evolving how they make theirs. Be careful out there!

TLDR: New fake 30s out as many have seen , but the new v's I just saw were perfect looking and even tasted somewhat close with the same stiffness. It is most likely benzos and a tiny bit of coke. Most of the good fakes are very close to the normal font, correct size, but harder and shatter more when broken. They usually have a sweeter taste and contain benzos, though the new v's also contained a bit of coke to simulate the energy/rush at the start of using oxy.

I put the cap back on the bottle and let it sit in my room, I basically forgot about it.

Well this week I have no hydrocodone, I do have 150mg of codeine from some Tylenol 3s. I checked on the opiod dosage calculator from the sidebar and it says an equivalent dose would be 233mg of codeine.

My question is what should I enter for the incomplete cross tolerance percentage? I remember reading something about how there can be really different percentages depending on the opiates involved, but I don't have any idea where to find the percentage for hydrocodone and codeine. 

Another question does anyone have any tips to get the most out of your opiate on top of grapefruit juice and Diphenhydramine? I'm very happy with the affects from my normal dosing, but getting more bang for my buck is always nice.

I'm sure I'll make a few people jelous with this last bit, but when I added in the grapefruit juice my high went from lasting 4-6 hours to lasting about 10-14 hours. From just 35mg of hydrocodone; I love having a low tolerance.

edit: One last question! If I were taking my first opiate ever and I took 150mg of codeine, what should I expect?  I'm researching this and my other questions on the side, but I always seem to find the best help from asking on here. Thanks in advance guys.",1370129881.0

After some recent complications earlier this year, I've been treated for chronic pain by my spine doctor (not a pain management clinic). 

For the first few months I was getting Perc 5/325, with refills every three weeks. I started taking more than prescribed early on due to legitimate pain, but I also enjoy me some pills. Not wanting to jeopardize my doc's trust in me, I usually did CWE, and when I ran out before refill time, I'd grab some blues from the street. 

I finally got my doc to put me on OC5s after voicing concern about long-term tylenol use, which was also legitimate since even though I knew the risks of APAP, I'd get impatient with CWE and just pop a few at a time. She said no problem, and told me to come down to the office to pick up the script., which is not unusual and has been the case for every refill since my initial visit earlier this year. (The phone call was made a week after an in-office visit for follow-up xrays, discussing the possibility of returning to physical therapy, etc.)

So I picked it up later that day, and when I got it there was a hole punched in the very top of the script paper. As far as I can remember, none of my previous 5/325 scripts had a hole punched in them. I filled the script at my usual pharmacy no problem, but it's got me curious, and also a little nervous.

I have chronic pain, and am unable to tolerate the typical barrage of SSRIs and anti-clonics which are often prescribed for my conditions, so I take about 120mg codeine daily for chronic pain- started out taking 30mg daily 10 years ago, but tolerance has risen. I was talking to my rheumatologist last week about some issues I've been having with the shorter half-life of codeine, as I have taken Tramadol before (which worked so well) but was unable to continue because my pharmacy kept running out, and withdrawals were ungodly. I can't go on ER versions of other opiates because they simply don't control my pain as well as codeine does.


He mentioned some patients have had positive experiences with taking lower doses of suboxone because they didn't really experience breakthrough or withdrawal pain in between doses, but I'd have to go off my codeine first completely in order to start suboxone.


My brother in law who is in recovery from an Oxy habit he unfortunately developed following a knee surgery advised me against subs because he said he felt terrible while on them, even long after detox.

I come here for honest feedback on opiates, from recreational to medicinal users, and would appreciate any experience or feedback.

Some will even try to weasel in a percentage for themselves if there was a significant amount of drugs sold. And probably the most pathetic and outrageous, some actually have the nerve to ask you for a piece of the pie just for selling in their proximity.

Fortunately I'm not a victim of this as I'm pretty street smart (not to brag or anything), but I see this shit go down all the time and it makes me sick to my stomach that these subhuman trash share the same air as me. 

If you really wanna live the lifestyle of a hustler acquire something to hustle through some other illegal means if you must, but there is nothing sadder than a begging ass mooching parasite calling himself a hustler but is too pathetic to actually bring anything to the table.

I managed to get the remaining morphine and water in to a decent solution. Once I had it prepped, I dropped my pants, assumed the position, and awaited the plastic, morphine-laced penetration. I eased the syringe into my anus, and once it felt secure, I had my anal invader release the morphine in to my body.

**How Bioavailability is determined, thanks to /u/blupblupblup**

> The way BA is defined, all substances have a 100% BA when IV'ed. Since oral bioavailability is defined as the AUC (area under the curve) of the oral dose divided by the AUC of the IV dose. AUC is the area under the plasma concentration curve of the drug from t=0 (the point of administration) to a theoretical t=infinity. The curve is acquired from fitting a model (depending on the mode of administration) to the measured points. Integration from t=0 to t=infinity then leads to the AUC. The exact formula depends on the model. IM and SC are often close to 100% for small molecule drugs (so excluding proteins). Deviations from this might also be caused by measuring errors (even though they are regularly found), since there is no known reason why IM and SC doses might have a sub 100% bioavailability: there can be no loss via feces (as with oral, rectal or intranasal dosing), there is no peripheral breakdown (as with proteins) and no first pass metabolism (as with oral dosing).

To save me some typing, all substances have a 100% BA when IV'ed.

**Methadone:** oral - 80-90%; rectal - 76% halflife - 24-36 ours

**Meperidine:** rectal - ~55%; IM - 80-85%; halflife - 3 hours

**Buperenorphine:** sublingual - 55%; insufflated - 48.2% +/- 8.35%; oral - 15-22%; halflife - 20-70 hours, mean is 37 hours

**Hydromorphone:** oral - 30-35%; insufflated - 52-58%; halflife - 2-3 hours

**Diacetylmorphine (heroin):** oral - <35%; insufflated - 44-61%; smoked - 52-55% halflife - 10 minutes IVed

**Fentanyl:** transdermal - 92%; insufflated - 89%; buccal - 50%; oral - 33%; halflife - 2.5 minutes IVed; transdermal - 20-27 hours

Mentions using Ketamine for getting off Heroin.","http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1fkow7/had_my_first_experience_watching_people_take_hard/

The whole post is a great incite on how opiate users are perceived by other drug users.



What interested me though was the mention of using Ketamine to get off of Heroin. One of the H users in the story was writing a paper on how Ketamine was better than Methadone/Suboxone for getting off of H.

You guys ever heard anything like this? I've only used K a handful of times and was mostly unimpressed. Is there something that I'm missing?  If K is good for WD, it would actually be a good way to get through a detox. The few times I did K it made me numb and made time fly by. That would be an excellent way to get through WD if it actually works that way.

I have tried a wide variety of different sedatives, hypnotics, benzozs, and anti-psycotics during WD with very disappointing results. Nothing I have tried makes it easier to sleep or pass the time in any meaningful way. The WD always wins. 

Anyone out there ever use K while in the throws of acute withdraw? If so, please share your experiences here. If it's better than Lopermide, I am sure most people on this sub would flip their wigs.",1370285889.0

The ones I got off SR must have been closer to 0.1-0.15 so I would do 3-4 of them and get a real nice bang.

Still- I am getting a little worried, can I OD without having gotten much of a buzz? Does anyone know of shooting half a gram+ in a single needleful of good (lets say 50%? <-- complete guess) dope? I know I probably need to get real and do a suboxone taper or just general taper to get my tolerance down anyways but I'm wondering how close I am to pushing the limit already with my luck since I really haven't had any medical problems as a result of dope yet (and would like to keep it that way).

I'm really not looking forward to cutting back and I still have a bit more money I can burn so I was thinking just keep my dose as is till I don't get much from it then take that as a sign to taper down hard. What do you guys think?

Also does anyone know about using DXM to reduce tolerance while you are detoxing/not using? Or about how long to reduce tolerance significantly? I've been using pretty much daily for about a year IV for about 3 months

It had been a couple months since I had a proper shot. It took longer than I wanted to get high, and I was anxious and angry. So I did more than I planned. Shot a thirty of tar and I'm usually at nod city with half a dime. I'm a small person.




I knew what happened seven seconds later with the needle still in my arm. I couldn't breathe, and I guess that's when everything went dark and I fell to my knees and leaned against the bed and thought, ""fuck, god. I dont think i want to die."" I dont pray, but there arent any atheists in foxholes. Everything went dark too quickly to even try and open a packet of subs. 




The few days following are a blur of sickness and fucking up suboxone dosage/ timing for the first time ever. I was so sick I wished I were dead. Nearly a week later, my body still feels like it's recovering. Sleeping 15 hours a day. Trying to eat something normal.

My family never took any pills they got for pain. They are cautious becasue my grandpa, my aunt and my cousin, got into opiate pretty bad. My parents are also slight hoarders. They haven't cleaned out our medicine cabinet in years. The main point is: I have alot of relatively not-so-great painkillers. They are good for me because I have a low tolerance.

Because these are quite weak, I didn't give a second thought to taking them. I treated myself every night before bed for a period of time. I didn't bother with a CWE because I didn't think it was worth the trouble. This came back to bite me in the ass. After a routine checkup my doctor has informed me that the blood test I got shows evidence of liver damage. It isn't too extensive. He said if I treat my liver better there is good change it will repair itself.

I took his advice and for the past three days I have been staying away from the pills. But I miss that feeling, I can't refrain much longer. I have thought to do the CWE. My question is, how effective is it? Will it remove all of the tylenol, or does is still leave some? How do I maximize its efficiency?

At my highest I was taking 160mgs but managed to taper down to 21mgs with little discomfort. Well due to some financial and personal issues I decided to stop going to the clinic. My last dose of 21mgs was this past Sunday. I'm aware of the severity of meth withdrawals and knew it was coming. I woke up Tuesday withdrawing and knew I wouldn't last long before copping some dope.

And before anyone lectures me, I understand meth is for getting off of dope. I made the conscious decision to go back to heroin. 

Now here is my question/issue. I have been doing shots of d throughout the day to try and get rid of the w/ds. I know the dope is good, and I get the rush, nod, and all that good stuff but I'm still withdrawing. Is this just because the length of time my body had had the methadone? Or because it is two different opiate compounds? 

I guess I was thinking that the heroin would ""replace"" the meth. I do feel better after doing a shot, but the w/ds come back pretty quickly. They aren't too severe, but definitely are uncomfortable.

Nothing can be harder than this feeling. This withdrawal and pain. I think the hardest thing about it is *knowing* that there is something that DOES and WILL help IMMEDIATELY if I could just get my hands on it.

Some say quitting cigarettes is harder than this. I don't see how the fuck that's possible.

However, I don't think I have ANY other recourse. Should I call him again? If so, how should I bring this up? I said I'd call him this week anyway but he won't be expecting this and I'm afraid he'll say no.

I have a pretty high oxy habit, like 8, sometimes 10 thirties a day. Due to financial and tolerance reasons, id like to bring that back down a lot. I usually break my 8 mg strips into thirds and one of those usually does the trick. Now here's what I'm not quite sure about: if I take a third strip for say, 3 of 4 days, and then either stop or take smaller pieces for a few more days, when the subs leave my system will I go into withdrawal? or is the majority of it over since the oxy had its 4-6ish days to detox out of my system and I didn't take the subs enough to create a new dependence. Or does it not matter, and switching from the oxy to the subs did nothing but maintain my normal dependence. Do I have to switch over and then taper down like I would taper down with the oxy in the first place? I don't know if the subs are masking a detox that is going on behind the scenes, and when that time is up i can stop taking it and have minimum problems, or if I'm just switching to a cheaper, longer lasting opiate that is just maintaining my habit unless I taper off of it?

Despite several opportunities to score back home, I never did. I was pretty proud of the fact that in all that time all i had was a couple batches of PST. Well 3 weeks ago, I came back to the city I left before to see some friends. Saw a girl that I have a thing for and really hit it off, got immediately offered a job that a friend referred me to, got offered to take over my sister's room in my brother's house due to my newfound employment, and said ""fuck it, I'm staying. 
   Well halfway through the next week shit is peachy, I'm going to work, getting laid every night, then I get called into the office. My background check came back dirty over public transportation offenses and that was it for that job, and apparently, room. No biggie, look for new job, see gf, couchsurf with friends. Well 3 days ago the girl says it's not working out, citing the reason I don't have my shit together, completely unsympathetic to the fact that it was purely a combination of her persuasion to drop everything and my utter misfortune that lead to my disastrrous situation...
   The next day I started drowning myself in disgusting booze pretty early and, of coourse, came to the conclusion that i should drown it a little further with sweet, black nectar. I found a guy who was willing to go in 1/2 on a 20 with me. We scored. We walked to a secluded freeway embankment to push off. Along the way he warned me to only do about .05, because the .1 I had could easily be the last thing I ever did. I pretended to agree and drunkenly pushed the whole point. I felt the rush in a way that was better than I even remembered it... for about 3 seconds. Then I woke up about 200 feet farther down the embankment than I had originally walked with paramedics standing over me and an iv of narcan taped to my hand, got chastized by emt's, physicians and nurses for about an hour, and continued to enjoy my itchy nods for the night after the narcan wore off a bit. 
   Oddly enough, I haven't had any urge to do it at all in the last 2 days. Maybe my 4th overdose is the charm when it comes to actually connvincing me to stop trying to sidestep my problems with opiates. Maybe I'm just being naive and in a couple days I'm going to want it as bad as ever. Any advice from anyone who's ever had a similar experience would be dearly appreciated. 

TL;DR Had a nasty habit, left town 8 months ago to clean up, did, came back a few weeks ago, was happy as fuck, everything went bad a couple days ago and I felt sorry for myself and decided to take myself out for a potentially fatal dose of heroin on a freeway embankment.",1370746097.0

So today I woke up, not completely sick because I had taken dones the previous morning. Was supposed to work 12-10. Well, I started feeling shitty and didn't want to be there so I traded shifts and got to get off at five.  
  
Here is where the fun begins. I call and call and text and text until finally one of my buddys said he had 15s. Ten for $130. Yes it sucks but I had to have something, cant find any dope recently, and someone very close to me was in pain so some were for them. So I drive down the road, wait about an hour in a parking lot. Driving there I felt something was wrong with my car, wasn't sure what. When my dude pulled up, he noticed I had a flat tire.   
  
I thought no biggie, I'll change it real fast and get on my way, go home and be high. I was wrong. Went to go jack the car, and up it went. However I didn't realize the jack was bent. Went to pull the tire off, jack slips out and down my car went. I freak out, because this car is shared among 3 people and without it we would all be sunk. I immediately thought I seriously fucked up, was running around frantically, crying, withdrawing, just having a bad time. I call my step father to come assist me, he gets there and tries to jack it up again with a board underneath the jack to level it, but we still could not get it up high enough.   
  
He decides to call his friend who has a real jack, and also an air pump because the spare tire was low on air. I go to sit in my car and wait, and pull out the bag of pills in my pocket. There was about 2 pills in it and a bunch of crushed up pieces.   
  
The bag was open in my pocket, laying on the ground using the jack I had crushed them, and ended up losing about 5 of the fifteens. I was freaking out so bad, stupidly, I called my dude, and spent my last 60$ to get two more blues. (I don't get paid for two weeks.) Finally, after about 3 hours we get the spare on and put air in the tire. I go drive around the block to see if its okay. It's not. I'm hoping it is just a bent rotor, but it might be worse.  
  
I fucked up. Spent all my money on pills that will be gone tonight, won't be able to help pay to fix the car which I need to get back and forth to work and get my goods and so on and so forth. Fuck today. Fuck Honda car jacks. Fuck overpriced pills and shitty dealers. Fuck man.",1370741848.0

Just some background information in case it is needed. I have IV'd before, but needles bother me and I virtually only use nasal ROA. My tolerance is around 50-60 mg of oxy ir or 2 bags of Camden dope to get me feeling really good. 

I used to smoke weed on blues all of the time and achieve an awesome high, but whenever I smoke on dope I get strangely sick (vomiting and nausea for 48hrs similar to the sick after taking too much suboxone). I've experienced this awful nausea nearly every time I smoke on dope and I have tried it with numerous different stamp bags, so I've ruled out a weird cut or the like. It's been a really long time since I've smoked on oxy (because they're so fucking expensive), so I'm not sure if I'd still be able to successfully do so. Does anybody else experience this type of issue? I think that it's pretty odd that dope is the only type of opiate that, when combined with weed, causes such a sick response from me. Is there something that I could do to prevent the nausea and still smoke? Is this a normal type of reaction? Why is it only dope and weed that makes me sick (have smoked on oxycodone, hydromorphone, morphine, poppy seed tea, codeine, and hydrocodone with no problem)?

For the last six weeks I've been clean, but getting drug tested twice a week by my parents at a near by hospital.  Well anyway tonight was my first relapse and I really don't want to be caught.  I was smart enough to freeze some clean urine.  My next drug test is going to be either thursday or friday it could be either day.  

Since this is my first time using in two months am I better off just drinking lots of water the next 3/4 days and peeing at the hospital.  Or should I use my frozen pee for the test which I know that i would have to get hand warmers to heat up.  I wanted to know is it possible for the hospital to tell that my pee has been frozen? 

When I go to pee no body pats me down or is even in the bathroom with me so It would be very easy to use frozen / fake pee.

My next drug test will be at the earliest 60 hours from now and at the longest about 84 hours from now.  There will be no problem to sneak the pee in.

Really she wasn't that reliable and I had my concerns about dealing with someone so young. The first time she actually came through, she mentioned that she could also get Boy (what the kids call dope in my area).

At the time the only dope connect we had was in the 'hood. It was powder and the quality varied substantially so it was rare that we bothered getting any and made due with meds.

Ol' girl only got tar and though I hate what it does to our veins, I've never been surprised by tar. It seems to be a pretty consistent quality regardless where in the city you go.

Anyway, that night we got a couple balloons to try. Super easy pickup. Took all of 5 minutes and didn't even have to leave the suburbs. As soon as we got home, we got our gear together that had been collecting dust, and pushed off...

It. Was. Damn. Good.

Early on she didn't have a car or enough money to buy any more than what she could immediately sell. I helped her out whenever I could because she really impressed me with her business and people skills and I knew she was going to become a really good connect. Also I was becoming fond of her. We hung out periodically and actually became friends.
 
Cut to now. She has a car, supporting herself and her own habit and has really moved up the ladder.

She cuts us deals on occasion, never keeps us waiting, stays in contact, will deliver if the Wife or myself can't get to the city and will never let us be sick. There have been two or three occasions where she has driven 30 miles to hook us up with a shot just for throwing her 5 bucks for gas.
I didn't intend to write a novel, but I'm more than a little high since today's score was particularly good.

tl;dr
I have an awesome connect who takes very good care of me. Also, just because someone is young and may seem naive, doesn't mean they won't provide good service.",1370896322.0

Two days ago I had gotten some cash, and decided to spend all but $20 on pills, as I had been scraping by an almost no medicine for over a week. I spent the rest on food and a beer, though now the food is gone, and the medicine I bought is gone. I don't want to ever have to make that kind of decision again. I'm hungry, well I was, until I started withdrawing.

All I have right now is a 15 mg morphine pill and decided not to take it today. Yes, I'm withdrawaling. I've taken some benadryl and am drinking a beer and it is almost time for me to sleep.

I decided to test myself in not taking it. Tomorrow, I have a doctor's appointment and am getting a facet injection (L4-5), so I know I'll be at least a little up on what they give me for the procedure, but I'm saving the 15mg morphine for the morning either way.

I'm trying to be strong, but I **need** to learn restraint, because I always get myself into the position that I take too much and run out too early, then I buy more and the process goes on all over again.

I'm SICK of it. YES -- I KNOW I can just quit, and am going to later this year as I have to travel abroad. But for now, if I can develop some willpower and restraint, it'll make quitting all together that much easier. Right now, I think the word ""restraint"" and the word ""opiates"", and I laugh because that combination seems pretty damn impossible.

Starting in January 2013, I started recording any and all drugs I had taken each day, including the amounts measured with a milligram scale.

I'm no stranger to opiates, but before February, I had never done heroin.

My decision to try heroin was one of practicality and frugality. The amount of money I'd need to spend on something like oxycodone is several times higher than what I'd need to spend on heroin.

I would like to know if it would be worth my time to post my notes to-date. Of course, I'd most likely condense them and make it easier to read. Maybe even some graphs and visual aids.

I'm not going to spend the time doing all that if nobody cares.

The juiciest details are:

* I went from doing it once a week to daily over the course of 4 months.
* I never IV'ed, just sniffed it.
* The dosage equivalent was 20mg H up the nose was the same as 30mg oxycodone IR crushed and swallowed. I think that's fairly strong stuff, but how would I know?

So, are you interested?

I was being a little impatient and didn't hold still enough during a shot. I have never had an issue before and got over confident. So I missed a little and then pulled out. There was a small raised area, very lightly raised and about the size of a quarter. It went away after some warm compress in about an hour. 

My question is this. My are is sore. Like a muscular kind of pain, similar to being punched in the arm. Several shots from a doctor have felt like this, I think it may be due to going through the vein and injecting into the muscle? Most questions on here (searched first) deal with accesses, and at this time my arm looks perfectly normal. There is just fairly minor soreness (again like a punch). This has never happened to me before and I admit I am a bit nervous. It sounds like abbesses are the biggest thing to worry about.

Do I need to seek medical attention? Did I just hit a muscle and accidentally IM instead? Have you ever felt this soreness before? Can I stop mentally freaking out?

I took my last piece of sub strip this morning, so I now must venture into town to try to find subs, benzos too.  They used to be everywhere here, so many people had em they were goin for 5$, til the Dr prescribing most of the city got hit by the DEA, now they're a little harder to come by.  But I am determined, yes I am!  It may be tough, many times I've ventured to the city in search of subs & people be like ""I don't know about that, but I got dope""...

And done.  Does this sounds right, or am I going to end up in the ER?  Also, Im wondering if I should wait more than 24hrs since Im taking ER medication not IR, any one have any input on this?  


I posted something a  few weeks ago about trying to drop my 200-300mg/day Oxy ER habit with subs, but I decided to start tapering at first before I tried the subs.  

Im down to 80mg/day comfortably and think I am ready to use the subs.  I hate to repeat myself with this post, but Im pretty freaked out of taking the subs too soon, but for obvious reasons am going to want it asap after I start getting sick.

I posted a few days ago about my problem here is the link if your interested: http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1g3mbw/drug_test_problems/ 

I have had a lot of experience with opiates in my life, but have never been drug tested till now and this upcoming test which will be tomorrow or friday is the first time I've ever been worried about failing.

I froze some of my urine which is clean about 5 days ago before I used so that I would have clean urine to use for the drug test incase I got tested.  And sure enough I am being tested.  Luckily I am just given a cup and get to go urinate in a single stall bathroom and I don't get patted down or anything so it won't be hard to get away with if I do it right.  

My biggest problem that I am facing is now just figuring out how to get the urine to the right temperature for when I pour it into the cup.  

Please anyone with experience bless me with your knowledge so I can pass this test!!!

Love you all be safe please.

Additional Info: I just wanted to add that I am being tested at a hospital so they test for everything pretty much and probably some of the best tests.  I am not being tested because I got arrested or anything though so if my urine does fail the test nothing happens except for me being embarrassed. 

Additional question: Since I am going to be getting drug tested often for the next few months I was thinking about using fentanyl because it is supposedly out of urine in 24 hours or less is this true?  Also if I need like 45 mgs of oxy to get a decent buzz how much fentanyl would I need?

So last week on Friday I received .5g of #4 from a reputable SR vendor, since then I've been snorting about 50-70mg every night spaced out anywhere from 4 hours to 10 hours. Previously I had no opiate tolerance, I did try H once before (about 250mg 3 months ago over 2 weeks) but that was it.

I don't plan on ordering more (don't even have a local connect), it's been fun for me- I enjoy the nod and even the itch (I don't get it too bad so scratching just feels good), but I want to know what I can expect in terms of withdrawal if I just cut if off like I'm about to tomorrow night. I know people say to not really do it so many days in a row..but I don't feel too ""compelled"" to do more at this point..I operate fine during the day when I'm at work etc., I'm coming into a situation in life where I know I won't be able to do it anyway so that was kind of why I wanted to have this small period of hedonistic indulgence. 

Thoughts? I know this place isn't /r/drugs so I'm hoping to avoid some of the danger / addiction talk. I'm well aware of that danger and I made the choice to do it this week and deal with the consequences of suddenly stopping- I just want to know what to prepare for, if anything. Reading around though I see people here slamming like .2-.3g a day..which I find pretty insane. 2 10mg lines and I am set for a good 3-4 hours lol..

Sorry about the length, i wanted to make it in depth as sort of a step by step if anyone wanted to try it out. Some starting info; i weigh 135 and started with an empty stomach. Im a dude and should have no tolerance, i only use opiates a couple times a month. I smoked an OC 15 last night to have something to compare to

I bought 3 pounds of poppy seeds from 3 different locations as well as lemonade and purified water to test all extraction methods. I also bought a little hand strainer from target that works perfect for this. So i flip on Mac Millers new album and got to work.

9:00-I mixed a half gallon of water and 1 pound of poppy seeds from Natural Grocers into a milk jug and shook for a couple minutes. I thought i put to much water, there was about 2-3 inches of water above the settled seeds. I put it in the fridge to sit.

9:24-Took it outta the fridge and strained out 2 red solo cups of the water. Its a light brownish yellow color and i can see the bottom of the cup. Gave one to a friend. Tastes a little watery, pretty gross. I chased it with a little lemonade though and it kills the after taste.

10:13-We've both finished our first cups by now and smoke a couple bowls, feelin relaxed. My friend has never tried opiates she says she feels a little body high. I feel a little fuzzy but it seems like its just the kush. Red Dot Music off Watching Movies With The Sound Off is dope, Action Bronson kills it. Still sounding like Ghostface lol
 
10:29-I left one solo cup left in the jug to sit and soak up anything left, about an inch or so above the stagnant seeds. Strain it out into the cup, this one is a way darker brown and is not clear in the slightest. Tastes dank.

10:55-Finished the second glass and im definitely getting a buzz on at this point, all my aches and pains from skateboarding and working out are gone. My heads getting foggy and my eyes low.
I saved the used and strained poppy seeds in a seperate bag to do a second extraction to get the last of the opiate. Funelled them back into the jug and mix with one solo cup of water.

11:11-After shaking for a few minutes i manage to pour another cup out and its just as dark and dank as the last one. I through the used poppies away, i figured after 2 extractions they're done. Ive only taken a few sips and im starting to feel great. Im going to blaze and sip this one slow to see how im feelin.

12:25-Floored, i drank the rest of the cup and then smoked a bowl and cigarette, that kicked me. Im a little itchy and scratching feels awesome. My eyes are heavy and im getting some euphoria. This is awesome for 10 bucks and i am honestly surprised.

I was able to extract 4 red solo cups of liquid using about a half gallon of water, that way i was able to gauge potency over time so i dont drink too much too fast. Depending on how i feel by the end of tonight and tomorrow morning, i will try the lemonade with a pound tomorrow and possibly the hot water method.

I recently lost my constant connection of Vics and it's getting unbearable. I was able to get through DTs with less problem than my mouth gives me on a daily basis. But I digress, after losing my supply I went to a dentist. I went in telling them that I have a bit of a tolerance for narcotics and explained to them my fears and heightened sensitivity to pain in my mouth. They put me in visible pain with the exam alone and sent me home empty handed with an appointment an extraction the following week. The pain had gotten worse in the days between the exam and the extraction, to the point where I was taking more ibuprofen than I felt was safe and it still wasn't even taking the edge off the pain. I went in for the extraction and was told ""We have you scheduled for 4 extractions in this one sitting but if you can't handle it we can always stop."" They had to give me ""More Novocaine than I've ever had to give a patient."" to get me numb enough to get the work going. There was an issue with the tooth coming out so the dr had to really work it and cut into my gums to get it lose. When he finally got it out I was in tears through the novocaine and told them I couldn't do the other 3. He said he was planning on giving me 5mg Lortabs for the pain, and I told him that they wouldn't help. He said he'd give me something stronger but the nurse came back with a script for 6 5mg Lortabs. I went home and 2 hours later after taking 2 of the 6 pills he had given me earlier I was still in extreme pain so I went back. He told me he couldn't give me anything stronger, and to take 2 800mgs of ibuprofen along with the ones I have left even though I had already told him of my history of ulcers. What this all boils down to really is that I don't know what to do anymore. I'm looking into a sedation dentist to relieve some of the pain and anxiety from the actual work it's self but I don't know what to do in the meantime or once the work is done. I know getting all the work done will eventually fix the whole problem but that eventuality is a ways away.

We have 30 minutes before we need to leave, and I'm hiding under the bed like a toddler. I can't get my shit together.. I can't do this.. He lets go of my ankle, and lays down on the floor next to me in his freshly pressed shirt.. He doesn't say anything, we just lay there like zombies, much like the 4 days prior that I had spent in my.. Place, if you will..

The place where everyone isn't looking at me, where everyone isn't asking ""what happened"" ... None of the strangers offering condolences can get me under there.. It's lined with his t-shirts, socks, underwear.. the last towel he used..His pillow that is still filthy from Starscape... It smells like every night before bed, and every Sunday morning.. I have a strange collection of miscellaneous shit from the past 4 years and I've just been laying in it for days. 

We have to ""view"" the body today. We have to say goodbye to the love of my life, my best friend... Everyone's best friend.. Our house is calm for the first time since Monday, when my whole world came crashing down. It's just me, my two roommates, and our fifth that had always rounded out the family. We are all dressed in funeral attire for the first, of three agonizing days of saying goodbye to one of our soldiers.. I happen to be ""the lady"" .. And I happened to have been madly in love with the soldier that left me in this world on June 14th, 2010, by means of a self inflicted gunshot wound. 

Fifth didn't live with us, because he was a heroin addict. Not because we didn't love him, or want him there.. It was just easier for him to live at his parents as his addiction deepened, mostly money wise.. He pretty much rode the couch, we called it his bed.. he was our undocumented roomate !

I had never done H. I got down on my fair share of get downs though.. At the time, I was an avid ketamollicaine (k, Molly, and coke in one scrumdiddlyumptious line) dirty deems, and benzo kinda gal.. I raged a lot of festies, smoked a lot of tree and just dug the mother fuck out of life ! It wasn't that I had no interest in dope.. I was just very conscious of fifths daily struggle to exist. I laid on the other end of the couch while he kicked uncontrollably, and poured sweat like a beast in the A/C... He always wanted to get clean, so anytime I'd get curious and start inquiring about giving it a rip, he'd remind me of all the pain id witnessed, and in some cases been through due to his love affair with dope.. I accepted it. Just lookin out for me ! 

I'm out from under the bed, but I can not get my shit together... Into the bathroom to fix my face... Fifth is in there.. With his works. 

I didn't put any thought into it really, I asked if his rig was new.. Before he could get ""yes"" out, I had his belt around my bicep and I was asking him to hit me... He obliged, and in that moment, I sold my soul to the needle. 

10, 9, 8... I'm warm. I must be under the bed...? I'm not..I'm in the bathroom ? I disconnect. 

I'm not lonely, or scared. 

I can fill a novel with my feelings, or thoughts.. Evident to whomever made it this far into my story.. But when it comes to explaining that first shot... The mental benefits almost over shadowed the euphoric achievements my body reached. From that first shot in the bathroom, I never looked back. I would *never* have made it through the last 3 years without dope.. To some, that truth is ""sad"".. To me, it's just truth I guess. THIS is what makes getting clean laughable to me... And the clean time I did rack.. Was hurtful, and scary, and a fucking joke.. Because I couldn't shut the want off for 35 seconds at a time. 

Tomorrow is the three year anniversary of my world packing it into a bullet... And next Tuesday marks the day I became an IV heroin endorser..

I really needed to dump that shit out. So if you took the time to read this.. THANK YOU !!! All of those memories play in my head like an infomercial.. I still have night terrors, trust issues, and a raging addiction... But for the first time, I can tell people, who if nothing else, catch my drift on the raging addiction part... 

**TL;DR** tomorrow is a shit 3 year anniversary for me (my boyfriends suicide) so I decided to tell the story of how I started to use... which coincidentally, will have its very own shit anniversary Tuesday. ",1371182263.0

Secondly, thank everyone who cared whether or not I'm dead.

In the future, if I die, a friend will make a post on this account telling you. I'm making this arrangement so, maybe, we can avoid the weekly post asking what happened to f_l_j, or where I'm at.

I don't post a lot because, one, I don't want to over-extend my welcome and, two, I only post when I feel I have something worthwhile to contribute. The e-popularity I enjoy here is kind of nice, and I don't want to piss off a sub (mostly) full of people I consider friends (or, at the least, kindred spirits) with tons of inane shit. While I have plenty of friends in real-life and a decent social life, like many of you, this is one of the few places I can truly be myself without alienation or judgement over my lifestyle.

I know I've been stringing everyone along with promises of a blog or at least a continuation/conclusion of the Great Suboxone Mishap. I'm sorry about not posting it, but I've been trying to sell a collection of short stories to a publisher, and I was told it all needed to stay un-posted for the time being. That time is up, though, since I'm giving up on that pursuit and the manuscript is going back in the drawer.

Lastly, as much love as I get from you guys I get about as much hate. I don't know what I've done to piss so many of you off, but, honestly, if you get so worked up when you see my username that you feel the need to message me hate-mail and death-threats (yes, I'm serious) you seriously need to just go do some goddamn drugs. We're all junkies here, and if you're *that* fucking full of hate, maybe its time for you to up your daily dose.

Or, maybe, you can go fall in front of a bus. I couldn't really care less one way or another.",1371176320.0

hydrocodone + xanax + soma and apparently a significant amount of trazadone to sleep.

Catheterized. It sucked. It was hurting like hell and I told the nurse unless she gives me something to numb it then I was leaving. So I left.

They put way to big of a catheter in me. They put like a fucking XL size catheter in me. My dick ain't that big lol

Moral of the story. Even with someone who has a high tolerance for oxy a few vicodin + xanax + soma + trazadone will land you in the hospital.

I used to have a syringe in my room full of narcan. My mom found it and thought I was shooting up though and threw it away. I'm guessing this would have saved my life without going to the hospital.

I'm very ashamed. I have overdosed once when I was 17 from demerol + xanax and vowed to never do it again. i really think the somas and trazadone did me in. I'm not 100% sure that the 50mg of vicodin and 10mg of xanax did me in. I usually take 10-20mg of xanax at once and im blitzed but no where near overdosing.

I have  taken a 60mg OP before or 3 blues + 10mg of xanax and I was fine. I **really** think it was the drunk combo with soma.

I have this bottle of syrup with about 200 ml left in it

It says ""hydrocodone/apap elixir"" and doesn't have any kind of dosage on it, it just says to take ""one teaspoon every 4 hours as needed for pain""

I've looked it up and it should be like 5/500 per 15 mL or 7.5/500 but I'm not sure.

I was thinking since one 5/500 lortab is usually prescribed for every 6 hours, and a teaspoon is about 5 mL, that a teaspoon of the syrup has ~2.5mg hydro

I have 3 10 mg methadone pills.  I do not want to get high, I would just like to have a day without pain.  I have no tolerance and have never gotten high from opiates, I've only taken them after a dental procedure and for a few days after a pretty bad car accident.

If I took 1/4 of one of these pills would I 1) be safe and 2) not have the every day aches and pains from which I suffer?  I have arthritis in my hands, hip, and neck that can be very, very painful.  My doctor and I have decided to just treat when it gets too bad for me to work, and then only with non-narcotics.

I just want to occasionally, on a weekend when I don't have to work, not hurt at all.  I can't imagine how great that would be.  Ignoring pain or putting it in a mental box to feel later, is draining.

I don't know anyone who takes pills, so I can't trade these for something else - based on what I read, it appears that they may not be the best in terms of pain reduction because they take so long to get in your system.  A friend who is on methadone maintenance forgot his pill case when he spent a couple of nights here a few months ago.  I called him back then, and he said to just flush them because it would probably be illegal to mail them to him.  I just put his pill case in a medicine cabinet and forgot about it until an hour or so ago when I was giving the guest bath a real scrub down.

I'm not an addict, nor have I ever tried opiates of any kind. I've lurked this sub for quite a while now, commented a few times, and can honestly say this is one of my favorite Reddit communities. The stories some of you tell are captivating to say the least, and I find that I understand the minds of drug addicts a lot better after spending some time here.

I just had a few questions that I've never seen asked here but have always wondered to myself.

1. Has anyone ever heard of an addict or a non-addict intentionally overdosing to commit suicide? (From what I have read an overdose isn't terribly unpleasant for the user until they wake up, would somebody who dies by overdose feel any discomfort?)

2. How many of you have decided to never kick opiates? (I have seen a few people state that they wouldn't want to live their lives without the feeling of opiates. Similarly, some people say they want to kick but eventually end up confessing that they don't think they'll ever have the strength.)

3. What is the longest you've experienced withdrawals for? (I commonly see people stating their heroin withdrawals last around/upwards of a week, while others experience only a few days.)

4. How much would you estimate you've spent in your opiate career?

Thanks heaps to anyone who answers, I'm just trying to understand you all a little better.",1371338062.0

The only connect I could find had some dope left, and I figured why the fuck not? So I picked up 6 bags and went back to my apartment to see what all the hype was about. Poured one bag out onto my mirror chopped it up into a finer powder an broke out the straw. After snorting it I waited, and waited, and waited...and waited, but never got the opiate high that I am use to after using oxy. It was similar to a light codeine buzz.

So at first i just thought it was some weak dope and waited a half hour before trying another half bag, and once again nothing close to the high i get from 60mgs of oxy. 

And BTW it was a light brownish powder, not too familiar with the different types of heroin, but I got it from someone who I consider a good friend so I'm pretty sure if it was something else he would have told me.

My question is basically...Was i just expecting too much from the all powerful heroin, or did i just get some shitty dope?",1371325358.0

Today I had a moment of weakness and called my dealer, who said he'd be ready in an hour. I had no money, but I left the house on a whim thinking if I could manage to SOMEHOW get money then it was meant to be.  
  
Walked passed an ATM and the thought to ""try"" to pull out cash- even though I don't have any- crosses my mind. I guess I was praying that the ATM would have a moment of stupidity and allow me to pull out money that didn't exist in my account. Sure enough, some guy walks by, sees my ""struggle"", and proceeds to hand me 40 dollars. Folded up in the money was a note with his name and phone number. He said ""if you want to pay me back, you can do so by letting me take you out to dinner. If not, I'm just glad I could help out a girl who was obviously in need."" He didn't even ask what the money was for, and didn't even ask for my own phone number.

* at about 1:30 I started to feel a bit of a buzz... then that was sort of it.

They both have never smoked pot, but they know I have in the past but they are extremely naive and don't think I use drugs. Anyway my apartment lease isn't up for another month so I left some of my stuff behind and the left behind items included some needles and a piece and a grinder, stuff like that. Well I got a call from one of my roommates dads and he told me he had some people who clean his rents houses go clean up and fix our apartment.

Throughout the conversation he kept stopping and asking  if I was ok, I would say yeah I'm fine and go on. He eventually lets me know that the cleaning crew found some needles in the apartment and I chuckled and brushed it off. He goes on to say, ""well they had to be yours because they had your initials on them."" My two roommates know that I shoot and they're cool with it, in fact one of them is a heavy user just not a shooter. I put my initials on them because a few of our other user friends don't have the fear of the dreaded needle and we always use at my place because my roommates don't care. It was kind of scary and I figured he might tell my parents (which would shatter their world), but he told me he understands and he was in college and did his fair share of morphine. He knew I had a rough semester (my parents separated for awhile and one of my younger sisters, 18, is pregnant with twins and her boyfriend is 27) and he told me that he knows that ""life is a real bitch"" and he discouraged my use and offered to drink with me and talk about it. 

So what was initially kind of scary turned out to be a pretty cool talk with a cool dude. I've cut way back on my use from daily for about a year to a handful of times this month because I have to leave town to score, which is a good thing. Tonight I banged a couple dillies because one of my shooting friends just had major surgery and he gave me some in exchange for a rig being that he's basically bedridden. Oh and I get to pick up on friday and go back to school to see some friends for the weekend. So yeah... it's nice when people are cool.

Apparently I had stopped breathing.

I responded to ""painful stimuli"" so they didn't narcan me on site. I was put into the back of an ambulance and taken to the hospital where I had to deal with chest x-rays, a narcan shot (literally the opposite of dope, I could feel the dope leaving my body as soon as the narcan hit my veins), and several blood and urine tests before they let me go, all the while with my parents, who had just learned of my use, sobbing and screaming at me about what an idiot I am.

Fun day.

My question is, without speaking to lawyer (I'm a college student and broke, so I'd expect I'll have to ask for a public defender) what could the legal repercussions be here? There were 3 full bags and a ton of rigs and old bags found by the state cop who searched my room after I was carted away. I didn't give him consent, but I'd imagine my parents would have. This is my first offense for any kind of drug related charges. I haven't spoken to the cops yet, and have no intention of doing so without some kind of representation, but apparently they told my mother that consequences will be lessened for me if I flip on my dealer. The dude was an asshole (my dealer, I mean) and I would have no problem seeing him in prison, but being a snitch is the last thing I want to be labeled as. They also told her I'd lose my car for a year, which I can live with. Jail time is something I'd like to avoid.

I'm in Pennsylvania, 20 years old, and currently a college student who receives (received) Federal Student Aid as well as a small scholarship from my institution. 

Basically what I'm asking for are stories of similar experiences. Has anybody been in this situation? What happened to you?

Relapse.


I sat down to write this a few hours ago when it was fresh in my mind, the words still burning thru my brain but they seem to have faded. For the best, really. I'd spare you some long spun-out rant about 'recovery' since even in it's honesty there wouldn't be much truth to the word 'recovery'. Is there any light in one's darkest moments? Relapse. I've been clean for seven months. Earlier this week a friend I haven't talk to in a while got in touch. We chatted briefly, push came to shove, he mentioned they were off the wagon once again, this time scoring not far from the place that I work. I didn't even ask, the details just came out.


Not even 24 hours later, they've asked me to loan them money for so they can 'stay well' - this means I essentially hook them up with two grams right now for the favor of them scoring me one and on the condition they pay me back two later. Seems like a great deal, for them, right? I'm not desperate enough to pay that kind of mark up for a connect - or at least if I am I don't realize it cuz I'm just not thinking about it from that point of view. Apathetic and scared to act one way or another in the scenario, I text back different versions of the word 'yes' to this plan as it takes shape around me. I don't particularly care about dope, getting high, or even 'feeling better' - the thoughts/cravings aren't there in my mind. The situation just begins unfolding in an all too familiar way and I watch as it happens, nodding along as if I'm powerless to stop it. I could've said no at any time, but I didn't.


I stared out the window on the drive home searching for a reason I hadn't spoken up. Was I rationalizing it out by helping my bud and his girlfriend? Nah. They're junkies. They're sick except when they are well. If you want either of them to do something, it's impossible unless their getting dope with you and then they're out the door and at my curb in twenty minutes. You know the type. So I wasn't doing it to help them, and honestly - I swear to you - I wasn't do it to help me, either. I've been clean for a while now, I rarely think about using. I haven't been getting cravings, I haven't felt depressed or inadequate in other areas of my life. I really had no inclination to use. It kind of boggled me, and that's when it came to me.

Heroin is a thief.


I'm financially secure right now. I haven't blown money on extra expenses, including drugs, in a long while. I'm single, so I haven't had extra money just thrown around. This could be part of why I justify the expense. The deal is that I front them money for two G's and they use a credit they've got to get one for me. Then next week they get me back a second G, making us somehow even. The details don't even really concern me, and I'm certainly never expecting to see that other G.


But back to heroin being a thief. Heroin pops up, at the mere mention of it's name, and bam -- I'm out almost $300. It didn't even really have to ask. It just said it'd be over at a certain time and to have my wallet up and ready. The motherfucker. Heh.


I'm puzzled through the next day at work, half wondering if I'm going to go through with all this but in the back of my mind there's no question. No resistance. Absolutely no voice speaking up. It seems so routine, like I couldn't say no if I tried. The decisions already been made for me. On the way to work I withdrew the money from the ATM. I thought twice a hundred times but I kept going thru the motions. I sit at my desk wondering why I dont' just text him, 'You know what man, I changed my mind.' but no good answers come to mind. I don't really care about keeping them well (that's a joke if I ever heard one) and I don't really care about getting high myself. . . but I stay quite. For whatever reason I stayed quiet.


After work we meet up, we meet his buddy at a hardware store and the deal is done. It's nice hanging out, kind of like the old friends we pretend we were but have never actually been. We shoot the shit for a minute, then part ways, I got 'my' dope in my hand. I don't even care if he pays me back next week - which would be the strangest part if the whole situation wasn't so surreal. I kind of don't care at all. Apathy seems to be my copilot right now -- or worse, I'm asleep at the controls. Sure there's a G in my pocket and another G's promised to me next week (that, let's be honest, I'm never planning to see.) I don't need another score anyway, getting a habit at this point in my life sounds horrible. I just walked away from this shit. I'm clean, this ain't me.


I head home, grab a spoon from the living room counter and fix up on my bed just how I used to. It's methodic, almost comforting in a twisted way. The smell causes me to snarl and almost vomit all over the floor but I hold back. For a moment I think back to when that smell meant, 'you're almost unsick' -- I've turned my brain off, emotions, whatever, anything to cry out against what I'm doing just seems like too much effort. Why? Maybe I'll know why after I do it. Heh. I know the answers but I turn a blind eye to them, why?! Because I can. Because I know there's a light at the end of the tunnel where none of theses answers even fucking matter.


I do one shot, just a test at first, new batch, whatever, low tolly -- and I get nothing. In fact, I think I semi-miss which is weird for me. Annoyed and nursing a sore spot on my arm I load up another and choose a different vein to go after. Half a dozen 'test shots' later I give up waiting for the rush I'm actually looking forward to my now. Like the stress of holding the rig in my hand meant I deserved to feel better. I knew subsconsciously that as long as I got high I wouldn't care so much about the answers or the questions, and that was partly right and partly wrong... I got high and I felt no different. I didn't feel good, even. No warm fuzzy rush, no need to repeat the experience. Just kind of... Uh, okay now what?


I guess what I""m trying to say is that relapse sneaks up on you. I had no reason to do this, nothing went wrong, nobody died, nobody even got hurt --- I wasn't feeling down, racing thoughts, sleeping poorly at night, fighting with my girl, or doing bad at work. I just heard from a homie, it'd been so long (for a reason, you feel me?).


I guess part of me just wanted to know what'd happen and now I know. Now I know I didn't/wouldn't/couldn't say no. I let heroin rob me, again - I pretended to stay in charge, to call it's bluff, pretended not to care (I had myself fooled, scary shit right there).


In the end habit took hold, I saw a path I could predict and I took it even though I knew the end wasn't anywhere near where I wanted to be. A lot of me said 'fuck it' figure it out when you get there. What's my plan when this G runs out? I haven't figured that part out, man. I guess it's back to the therapist, back to the doctor, back to the outpatient meetings, gotta figure out why I couldn't stand up and say no. Why I didn't just text back, 'no thanks, man'.


I think writing this out as helped me a lot. It was a weird experience that's for sure. HOw I could just let that happen, I was almost testing myself every second (in retrospect) as if, 'will he say no now?' 'now?' and i failed each one.


Just thought this might be a lesson out there to somebody, anybody, stay away from people that use. Let's face it, most of them only hit you up when they want something. Saw in here a few days ago someone can only be friends with someone if they were friends BEFORE either one of them started using and I agree with that. Old friends seem to respect that boundary, even if they have their own addiction they seem to know you want something better for yourself.... it's those junk friends, we've all got 'em, this dude I haven't talked to in almost a year and i'm not sure how he even got my new number but he sure knew who to hit up to get what he wanted. Heh. I never even felt like I was doing them a favor, which I might've rationalized once a long time ago --- I just felt like heroin had announced it was coming on over and to have my money ready at the window.... heh. Even now, I haven't done anymore aside from that first round of shots and I don't want to do anymore. I plan to flush it but I had to sit and write this out first. 


Watch out for relapse -- serious. Watch out. Say no. Ignore folks. Even once I saw this one coming it was more or less too late. I felt defenseless which was just my way of submitting to my addiction and I realize that was weak. I should've reached out to a real friend, I should've trusted that I knew how this would end but it was my first relapse so I didn't really KNOW, you know?
I'm writing this so those of you out there wondering what the outcome of such situation would be.... NOW YOU NOW.... don't test yourself, don't kid yourself. NOW YOU KNOW.


Time to start over. I know I've learned something major here but we'll see yet if it was worth it.
Thanks all.


reposting for opiates edit : 

I do have remorse for what I did, yeah, but I""m not beating myself up about it. It was more stupid than anything else, spending the money/time etc. so I consider myself lucky. I could've done that whole bag last night if I was who I was a year ago, but I didn't. And that's huge. I know if there was a 'next time' though I might not stay as lucky. Too slippery a sloap, you know what I'm sayin, it's frightening to me and hella unsettling just how anticlimactic the whole thing was. I guess relapse, like recovery, is whatever you make of it. 

I decided not to take any time to edit this over because frankly, I gotta go to work. I haven't done any more shots or even really looked a the shit since shortly before I wrote this. I told a friend what's up and they're gonna ride home with me after work. They don't use, never have, never want to, so I'm thinking we'll have some sort of a bonding moment over some good herb and flush the thing.

I have been working with njstein over the last several months to keep at least some regulars in /r/opiates IRC channel. We've managed to keep a handful of people, but a lot of you are joining the channel, saying ""Hello?"" and then leaving 30 seconds later.

This is not how IRC works. 80% of the time you join the channel, then quit two minutes later, someone was there to talk to you just moments after you left. IRC thrives on idlers, these are people who keep their page/client open and pop in to talk when they have time. If you all keep quitting so soon, the channel will never grow, there will never be more conversation and it will be all your fault :P 

I've spoken to crystal a few times about the large differences between the tinychat and the IRC room, and hey, I understand! The chat is a lot more intimate, it's more familiar and all of that. I can't TC @ work, but I can IRC all day long. This may or may not be the case for you, but if you ever popped in to say hi and it seemed dead, I probably said ""god damn it"" right after you quit. I have been lurking about this sub for... years? year? I'm not sure, but I did feed the guru his first hit of acid and showed him more bubble hash than he'd previously ever seen. So I feel like family at least :) Anyway, I'm done ranting now, you can find to the IRC room right next to the TC link in the side bar. Personally I hate using IRC through a web page, if you would like help getting an irc client installed, I'm your man.

I had picked up 6 15mg oxy for myself and a friend a few hours earlier. Originally, I was just starting to feel a little buzz and head to the pool. So I had on board shorts with my keys, wallet, phone, cigs, and lighter in it. My friend, whose cash I grabbed, had just gotten back to town and really needed something, so I told him I'd skip the pool and grab him another 6 for himself. To make a long story short, somewhere along the mile walk back to his place, all but one slipped through a tiny hole in the one pocket of my shorts. I would never rip him off, and he was even gonna toss me one and a Xanax bar for the trouble. Fuck my life. He will forgive me, but I know he will never completely trust me. And that feels horrible.


Edit: soooooooo! I debated going back all day after I got out of work. I got off, picked up a few more for a friend from my delivery man, and smoked a fat j with my brother. After a little while, I said fuck it and walked back. I'm glad I did, because I found one of the little green bastards. Scoured the area, but only found the one. Needless to say, I was stoked to find it! Hell yeah!

A side note: my buddy totally understood, and after all was said and done, he shouldn't have spent the cash he said, because he got an eviction notice and needs to pay 100 bux by tomorrow. Now he will have cash from me paying him back and I promised to help him get the last little bit together as well. All ended well",1371607752.0

**Note: hydrocodone will almost always come in pill form and also contain an OTC painkiller like acetaminophen. For this reason, you must perform a cold water extraction (CWE) to get your hydrocodone in the form of a pure water solution. Exercise extreme caution when combining this formula with any other drugs (except cannabis), because we are strongly inhibiting a liver enzyme. I have researched interactions between these chemicals as well as how they affect your body, but further research is recommended when adding other chemicals to the equation.**

If you follow this guide exactly you will increase both the duration and quality of your high, as well as reducing the buildup of tolerance. This formula can be readily altered to have the same effect for other opiates, but will be different due to how different opiates are metabolized in the body. Here is all you have to do, followed by explanation:


1. |T-55|  20-30mg DXM

2. |T-10|  grapefruit juice AND antacid (Tums, baking soda)

3.   |T-0|  hydrocodone AND grapefruit juice AND more antacid

4. |T+15| consume more grapefruit juice throughout duration of high

Explanation of routine:

**DXM**

DXM functions as an N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, which reduces the buildup of opiate tolerance. In some ways, DXM is the most important part of my formula as opiate tolerance is quick to develop and slow to heal. DXM is taken first because CYP3A4 is an important enzyme to metabolize DXM. After we have given time for DXM to take enter the bloodstream, we inhibit the enzyme as strongly as possible with our grapefruit juice. I leave 45 minutes for the DXM to metabolise in your liver, but if your stomach is not empty you should probably leave more time before you start consuming the grapefruit juice. DXM can be acquired from OTC cough medications. Make sure your source of DXM is pure and contains no other active chemicals, especially not acetaminophen. **Taking more DXM will NOT be more effective at further reducing tolerance.** Do not exceed the recommended adult dose of DXM as it is a powerful chemical with the potential to spoil your high with bad side effects.


**Grapefruit juice**

Grapefruit juice is a potent selective inhibitor of enzyme CYP3A4. **We want to inhibit CYP3A4 as much as possible** because this is where hydrocodone is metabolized into norhydrocodone, which is inactive on the brain (a waste of your drugs). Grapefruit juice therefore increases the bioavailability of your hydrocodone. Important: your juice should be **100% white grapefruit juice from concentrate** as this will contain the ideal concentration of chemicals that we want. If CYP3A4 activity is induced, or stimulated (the opposite of what we want), more of your hydrocodone will be rendered inactive instead of converting to the far more choiceworthy hydromorphone molecule. You should drink most of your juice immediately after consumption of hydrocodone, and continue drinking afterwards to keep your enzyme inhibited for as long as possible. Drink a lot of grapefruit juice. I recommend not mixing the juice directly with your hydrocodone solution because the juice is moderately acidic, which could potentially damage your precious hydrocodone.


**Antacid (Tums)**

Opiates are fragile molecules so we want to limit their exposure to destructive environments like acids. You will be consuming your opiate with large quantities of grapefruit juice, which is a significant acid. Taking antacid, before and during consumption of opiate, should help preserve the opiates in your stomach by balancing the PH level of your stomach.


A few general tips to maximize your experience:

1. Try to workout before you consume your opiate. The feeling of warmth seeping throughout your body, soothing your aching muscles, is without compare.

2. Try to space out opiate experiences a week apart or more. This practice will further slow the development of tolerance. If you feel the need to get high every day, you are addicted or well on the road to addiction. Opiate tolerance, once developed, has been known to linger for years, and you will need higher and higher doses to feel anything. If you use opiates too often, the magic will be lost and you can never get back the wonderful high that results from low tolerance.

3. The head high of marijuana greatly compliments the opiate body high, in my opinion.

Do not inhibit CYP2D6 (as would cimetidine and quinidine/quinine). Clogging this enzyme will reduce the conversion of oxycodone to oxymorphone, reducing the quality of high. The experiment I cited explicitly proves this interaction (they even used quinidine and concluded that it decreased the effects of hydrocodone).

*Why not stimulate CPY2D6?*

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10824623

As you might think, it would be desirable to selectively increase CPY2D6 metabolism. Unfortunately such agents are hard to obtain. St. Johns Wort does potentiate CYP2D6, though it has been shown to potentiate CYP3A4 as well. This would be counter-productive, so St. John Wort should not be used. I also imagine that the stress of both inhibiting and inducing an enzyme at the same time (as would grapefruit juice and St john’s) could not be good for your body.   

*Duration of grapefruit juice as inhibitor of CYP3A4*

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11061578

Take grapefruit juice  (concurrently) with hydrocodone for maximum inhibition effect. Drinking grapefruit juice before the hydrocodone (preloading) should also add to the effect, so I recommend doing both.  

*White grapefruit juice from concentrate is most effective*

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1873672/

*Why not use Benedryl or Chlorphenamine to reduce itch?*

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11936702

Many people report a significant itchiness that spreads on the face and body as hydrocodone kicks in. Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Chlorphenamine, two OTC antihistimines, have been anecdotally confirmed to reduce this itch. Unfortunately, both antihistimines are inhibitors of enzyme CYP2D6. For some opiates this would be ideal, but this is ruinous for hydrocodone. This is exactly what we don't want as this will cripple our production of hydromorphone. If you took these antihistamines, you would be trading your high for reduced itchiness.

*DXM as tolerance reducing agent*

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18819620

*Regarding the metabolism of DXM*

I'm curious if there's a big difference between snorting heroin and snorting oxycodone.

My problem now is that it costs me $300 for 10 oxycodone which might last me a day or two.

I was looking on SR and noticed I can get a bun + 3 extra stamps for just over $100 and I read elsewhere that a good stamp is about the same as 30mg Oxycodone.

I'd really like to save some money, so would it be worth switching to heroin??

Are the highs much different?

Are the cons A LOT worse making the switch from oxy to heroin?

They seem like the same drug to me.

Any input at all would be greatly appreciated... becasue I'm seriously considering making the switch.

But, I copped and I'm used to something black and rock hard that shatters with pressure, something black and very maleable and sticky, or I've even gotten brown powder that when blown on with hot air, it turns into the 2nd type.

However, the thing I got today is this extremely dense brown almost solid. It doesn't shatter when I pinch off pieces, but instead comes off in little bits that you can roll around in your fingers into a ball easily almost like clay but very coarse clay. 

It smokes kind of hot and leaves a dark trail and it doesn't taste like anything I've ever had.

With that said, I'm nodding pretty hard, can't tell if it's from the detox or if this shit is good.


Anyone else have any experience with this type of H?

I ended up getting an opana 30 not expecting much but it was a decent price ($25) which wasnt bad because in my opinion an opana30=2 roxy30s which in my area are easily 20-30 a pop. I was told i cant iv these and i havent done a pill at all, let alone snorted anything in longer than i can remember but definitely well over a year.

A daily weed smoker for 2. When I first started smoking weed, my opiate dealer referred me to one of his friends, who sold weed exclusively. With him, I met many of the friends I have today, some of which I call my best friends. None of them would ever dream about using any other drug, and very misinformed when it came to drugs in general(PCP makes you eat people. WTF). Their ignorance aside, they're very relaxed people who I could tell anything to, or so I thought. After a night of chilling together at my place, I decided to tell a few of my best friends about my opiate use. They fucking went off. They told me that I'm a loser junkie who'll end up homeless with no teeth(Again, wtf). They told me all their misconceptions of opiates(Saying black tar makes your skin turn black) and told me that they would never associate with an addict and told me to leave them alone. They left my place in hurry, acting disgusted with me and acting as if I were a lesser human than them. It's been about a week, and they refuse to answer my texts or calls. Honestly, I'm shocked. How could a few people who were some of the most caring people turn into hateful monsters so fast? I don't know what to do anymore. I've lost my best friends in the world because I chomp some pills a few times a week. I didn't really have any friends before, and I feel so alone.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kind words. I have now realized that my friends are not friends if they cannot tolerate my opiate use. It will be tough to get over the fact of losing them, as they were people who I actually cared for, but I have a feeling I will find friends who truly accept me for me, including my drug use.",1371964221.0

Every Saturday, I get a take home bottle for Sunday. I've been saving these take homes for the past few weeks so I have them when I get to the ocean. The thing is, the meth just isn't holding long enough and I'm finding myself getting really sick usually by Sunday afternoon. I've read good things about Lope so I went out and bought some today. Bad part is, where I went, they didn't have pills, only the liquid. I bought 2 bottles and 1 whole bottle equals 32mgs of lope hcl.

Anyone have any experience with the liquid Imodium? How many mgs do you suggest I start out with and when should I take my first dose?

If this worked you could potentially be smoking dope in public, and no one would be the wiser, cops wouldn't even know what they were looking at, and you wouldn't be carrying around any incriminating evidence.

I've been through this before and every time i tell myself i need to get some narcan to keep in my little ""kit"".  but i still haven't.  how do i get narcan exactly?  is it available on SR?

so this guy is laying on my floor.  one of my friends is flipping his shit, my other friend, who is a nurse, was monitoring his breathing and heart rate.  I was honestly just pissed.  There was a huge dude layed out on my floor, and i didn't get my drugs.  I stay about 2 blocks from a hospital so i had freaking out friend back the car into the yard and the three of us all carried his heavy, completely unconscious ass to the back seat of the car.  He was still breathing and had a stable heartbeat.  He reacted slightly to earlobe pinches and sternum taps.  He was mostly just nodded the fuck out, but that is the beginning of the danger zone.  So we safely get him in the car without bumping his head or squishing his feet.

Y'all are gonna think i'm a dick and i'll probably get downvoted but whatever, fuck you, i was sick as a dog.  At this point i reached into his pocket and grabbed the pill bottle he keeps his shit in.  I grabbed out his bag of dope, easily less than half a g now(he had shared with the other two folks, too.  Just not me.)  and poured about about .15 into my own baggy.  then i grabbed a xanax and the blunt he had stashed in the door handle.  I copped for him, then i carried his fat ass to the car and safely sent him off the emergency room.  I deserved that shit.  I gave the pill bottle to the more level-headed of the two friends and asked her to make sure that's not on him when he goes in(DUH, i wouldn't put it past these asshats...).

Moral of the Story:  Don't pop benzos all day then do a giant shot of dope, it's dumb.  Do a test shot at least.  

A question also arises; to cop for idiots or to not cop for idiots.  On one hand they have lots of money that they can blow on drugs and help support my hustle but on the other hand they aren't too sharp.  The nurse is pretty smart, she has done her research and she knew exactly what to do but her boyfriend(a friend of mine since 2nd grade) and this guy that they introduced me to are about dumb as bricks and have very little understand of drugs other than ""they fuck you up"".  They also call and text incessantly when i'm out on a run for them ""are you there yet?  did you get it yet?  Does it look good?  How long til you get back?""  so fucking annoying.  Other times they call me saying they want a hundo bag and i make all the necessary phone calls and get everything set up and they back out at the last minute.  I'm starting to think they are just more trouble than they're worth.  As a matter of fact when dude first hit the floor and nurse friend was checking his vitals, i screamed 

""GET HIM THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE AND TAKE HIM TO THE ER AND NEVER EVER FUCKING CALL ME AGAIN DELETE MY NUMBER AND WHEN DUMBFUCK OVER THERE COMES TO TELL HIM TO DELETE MY NUMBER,TOO.""  (we had exchanged numbers)  My hustle partner disagrees.  He says that if they keep spending money like that we can start getting some good hustle action goin.   What do my brops think?

TL;DR- dude did way too much after i copped for him and he told me he'd give me a bag.  I got him safely to the hospital but not before i grabbed a little bit of dope and a pill and a blunt off of him as an EMT/finders fee.  He actually just texted me thanking me for getting him to the hospital and asking for a ride when he gets done up there, offering to ""hook me up"".  that's funny... 

also i'm pretty high on xanax and the dope and smoking half the blunt.  This took me almost 2 hours to write.  noddin pretty hard.  happy birthday /r/opiates!  did i read the post today?",1372107404.0

So, I have a question about something I've always wondered about. I have a bottle of T3's (acet/codiene/caff) that I've had sitting around a while. I'm not a frequent user, but every so often (maybe once a month) I indulge in these. Since I have a low tolerance and a sensitivity to opiates that runs in the family, I started out with a low dose - first I took two, which gave me a dull, somewhat enjoyable buzz, then I took three, which I found very very pleasant.  
But here's the issue - when I took four a few weeks later, I felt nothing. Nada. Not even a tingle! I thought it must have been a fluke and tried again another time, but had the same results. This was a waste of 8 of my T3's and naturally, I was pretty bummed out.  
I stick to taking 3 now, and because of my situation, it works pretty well. So, that's my question - what is making them not work above my usual dose? Is it the caffeine? I haven't been able to find any answers yet, so I figured I'd ask here.  
TL;DR Codeine not working at all when i try to up my dose, even with no tolerance and sensitivity. wtf

I present to you the remnants of 7x30mg oxymorphone, and 
39xbags of ECP, but its from Delaware which to my knowledge 
deals only with $5 bags. If anyone wants to see the pitiful size 
of these small wonders, lemme know. And a common object 
for comparions purposes (cig, chopstick, microUSB plug, ETC.)

Pills are oxymorphone 30mg aka generic opana

ROA for the pills is insuffalation (nasal, sniffing, snorting, or tooting.)

Dope is stamped corvette, misspelled with one t, or purposely left out to fit the bame ob the bag, this is what's left of 3 bundles.
I like to make my own bags by pouring 3 bags into a fourth.
I do this to reduce time and evidence so if i end up on the
move or at a non opiate users house (never happens) i can ""use their
restroom"" without raising suspicion. And its a lot easier to 
hide 4 bags and glassines than it is to hide 16 of the same. Now the
! Bag began as one of my 4x bags (which i always mark or otherwise
keep separated. harm reduction.)  Other than it being 4 bags in 1
I also added all my scrapings from all the other glassines (which I
don't flick or otherwise force out, so i always have a nice wakeup
when i have a good night )
 All in all the ! Bag is about 8-10 bag.

And of course the stamps are IV or GTFO.


TL;DR

5x30mg generic oxymorphone (sniffable)
Corvete (sp) stamped bags ECP 
And a ! Bag with ~9 bags in it.



EDIT-
I forgot all about my fortune. In fact i forgot all about the chinese food altogether. I thing. I'm going to check what's left over food-wise and enjoy the ! for the rush. Afterwards it will be time to start in on oxymorphones, though i am considering performing an alcohol extraction so i can enjoy IV'D oxyM. Its been a long time since I've been able to iv OxyM and that was with the IR 10mgs. so I'm a little nervous about the extraction. process. but it sound simple enough and I'm pretty sure im competent enough to not screw it up

All the years of torment build up for the split second and threaten to disembody me. And then I snap out of it and I feel physically like crap.

sometimes I wonder what anal stimulation feels like... I never get these thoughts when im sober its weird. Its usually from the weed not the dope tho.

This is fucking stupid, but here it goes:

So, we all have our ways of scoring money for shit. And I'm no different than anyone else in that regard. However, it seems this last endeavor has put me in a tough spot.

I'll just lay it all out for you.

My friend and I were hella sick one day. He asks me if I'm capable of opening a bank account. Sure am, so I do. He has this plan that if I open a bank account and we deposit a check into it, we can withdraw the money right away because the particular bank we used honored checks on a sort of trust system. Welllll, turns out the only checks we had available were checks from an account I had closed with another bank in the past, but my fucking stupid ass decided to use them anyway.

The plan was to do all of this and then turn around and claim that my account had obviously been stolen and it was not me writing the checks - which really wasn't, it was my friend. I simply just gave him the check, my debit card, and the PIN number and he wrote it, deposited it, and withdrew it. So, I guess I could claim it was sort of stolen.

I don't know what I should do about it now. The bank has sent letters informing me that my account has been debited for the amount of the checks and other types of fees and letting me know what I clearly owe them some money.

How should I go forward? What is the worse that can happen - worst case scenario? Should I claim it to be stolen anyways and hope for the best? Or should I just own up to the bank? Is it possible to ignore this and maybe one day just deposit a fat check for all the money owed bringing my account back to positive and never mentioning it again? I need some real advice, guys. 

Fuck, I told you this was stupid.

Or are they all truly limited to the badlands? Just want to know whether or not I should even bother cold-copping on the west side, and perhaps if there's any signs, codes, slang, or dealing customs that are Philly specific that I should be aware of before trying to make a cold-cop deal. 

Any tips from the Philly bropiates would be much appreciated. 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who offered tips the other day. I had a successful cold-cop outing a bit ago and am now snappin' the band off a genuine Illadelphia bundle. Peace to all.",1372296335.0

I had never heard of such a program until I watched [this Drugs, Inc. episode](http://youtu.be/kYiuRyLnZOk?t=41m54s) (skips to the relevant part) that featured a program in Switzerland that goes beyond simply providing needles and naloxone and actually distributes pharmaceutical-grade heroin for free to users. The program also provides a variety of other medical and counseling services to try to improve people's lives.

A nice summary of the documented effects [can be found here](http://www.citizensopposingprohibition.org/resources/swiss-heroin-assisted-treatment-1994-2009-summary/).

Highlights of benefits, taken from the summary linked to above:

* Crime Issues: 60% drop in felony crimes by patients (80% drop after one year in the program). 82% drop in patients selling heroin.

* Death Rates: No one has died from a heroin overdose since the inception of the program. The heroin used is inspected for purity and strength by technicians.

* Disease Rates: New infections of Hepatitis and HIV have been reduced for patients in the program.

* Cost: 48 dollars/day: Patient costs are covered by national health insurance agency. Patients pay 700 dollars/year  for the compulsory insurance. Note: The Swiss save about 38 dollars per day per patient mostly in lowered costs for court and police time, due to less crime committed by the patients.

The bulk of information on heroin-assisted treatment relates primarily to the macro-level effects of the programs. But I'm more interested in hearing how the availability of such a program would affect you guys personally.

If such a program were available to you:

* Would you choose heroin-assisted treatment, methadone/buprenorphine treatment, or no treatment at all?

* Would you choose to participate even in spite of harsh restrictions like surrendering your drivers' license?

* Realistically, would you use the money you save obtaining free heroin from the program to pay for ""normal"" things (electronics, housing, cars, rent, clothes, savings, etc.) or to pay for even more opiates from non-government sources?

* How would your daily life be affected? (time spent trying to score, people you associate with, etc.)",1372285393.0

Typically around 140-180mg of oxycodone per day. (CWE used constantly). Fortunately my habit has never gotten higher than that because my sole connect for pills only gets the percs and I know 0 other people that use or supply. 
He gets them to me in limited quantities at a time so I'm generally never able to take more than 14 pills in a day without running out early. The thing that will shock most of you I'm sure is that I live in NYC and this is my only connect. Have asked a few other people at times but never really branched out beyond my one guy (his main product is white). 

Anyway, onto my question. He's been dry for a few days now and just reached out to me to tell me he had something. We meet up and he tells me he still can't get percs but he felt bad for not being able to source them and so as a one time only deal he was able to get me a gram of BTH. 
Now, I had thought that ECP was the only thing on the east coast and I have tried that one before (snorted - it was weak and it took a lot to feel something) but he told me his guy got it from Mexico and to be careful. None of these guys, to the best of my knowledge, fuck with H and so they weren't sure exactly what to do with it. 

My question is, based on my tolerance and stuff what's the best way to use this? I do not have any interest in shooting it. I have only briefly looked at it (at work still) and its very black, very sticky, and smells a bit like vinegar. 

So would anyone mind helping me out? Smoke a bit on foil? How much? I appreciate it, thank you guys!

He uses rec., and I'm worried about getting him into it more. What are the benefits and pitfalls or dangers of dating a fellow user?","Hey guys,

I've met a lot of you over the past several months but I haven't been around much lately, internet and money problems galore! Anyway I hope to come back more often, how are the TinyChat and IRC doing these days? (I am LookNoHands, btw, on TinyChat)

Anyways, I have something I need to bring up and need your advice on, I know you guys can help. In February I broke up with my abusive boyfriend -- who by the way, constantly berated me for my opiate use, not fucking cool. I have to take this shit for chronic pain and yeah, you get addicted to it, you get tolerant, this horrible cycle of pain and pleasure and withdrawal is a part of my life and that's how it is. He couldn't accept it, but it wasn't why we broke up anyway. I broke it off with him for other reasons.

Fast forward to now, I've had a friend online I met in an online game I've played since 2002 (though I met him in 2010). He's coming to visit me in about a month, no fucking shit, we go his tickets today and EVERYTHING. I'm really excited, and we're really into each other and I can easily see this expanding into something more.

I have been 100% honest about my opiate use from the start with him... besides, we've been like best friends to each other for three years, we know a hell of a lot about each other. He says he's liked me for a long time, but for some reason I couldn't see him the way he saw me until more recently, but I'm glad I have and he's an amazing person.

**Anyway, to the issue: He uses recreationally**, about every couple of months. I've told him that I *am* addicted to opiates, and asked him the other day if he is *really okay with that*, if we get into a more serious relationship? He says yes, and that if need be, he'd help me in any way he can -- even get me some if I get sick, or help me quit, whichever way I want to go. When I'm withdrawing, he's the only person I can stand talking to -- so he's seen me like that already.

One thing I worry about though is the possibility of getting him more hooked on them, being around me. I use **every day** (oxycodone and hydromorphone usually), but whatever I can get my hands on if I have to, H rarely -- but it's there. I've got some dillies for him when he gets here, for us to have fun with, he asked for them, I didn't push them on him or anything of course. So I obliged and stashed some away.

Even though I've been using opiates nearly every day for ten straight years, going on eleven soon, I've never been in a relationship with a fellow user.

I'm afraid of getting him more addicted and/or getting into the complications related to dating a fellow user (even though he uses a lot less than I do). What are they? What are the benefits and pitfalls? How does dating another user affect the relationship in general? I can't help but think he'll use more around me and that worries me.

I'm at least happy we were both able to get vacation time from work so we get a full ten days in Hawaii (where I live) together. Undisturbed, just me and him... I need a vacation and this is so *perfect*.

I know a lot of you are in relationships with fellow users, and I'd appreciate any advice as I can see him and I getting into a relationship, we're already in a long-distance one, but I mean taking it a step further, as he's said that if I still feel the same way about him after he visits, he'll move over here. He did used to live here as a kid, but on a different island, he says he's ready for a change anyway. He currently lives in a shitty state as it is. I love him and don't want to cause him any harm, but I also want to know the dynamics of that kind of relationship *if* he started using more.

Thanks /r/Opiates, you guys mean a lot to me, even if I don't speak here a lot anymore, just coming here and reading some of the things that are talked about helps me out a lot.

**TL;DR**: Potential boyfriend material is fellow user, I use every day, he uses recreationally. I don't want to get him more addicted -- at the same time, I need to know the dynamics of user/user relationships, because I've always had user/non-user relationships (me as the user).",1372395918.0

A year or so ago she got caught with 40+ blues, her ex-boyfriend was selling them. She got a felony distribution charge, and received a 1-year suspended sentence with 2 years of probation.

After failing multiple drug tests, the court ordered her into an outpatient program. On the day she was supposed to graduate, they found some type of drugs in the bathroom. She was somehow blamed for it and got kicked out.

On Wednesday she has to appear before a judge, and it is highly likely she will be remanded into custody.

Obviously I'm very upset. I've never been in prison before and neither has she. She's a very attractive, small 23 year old girl. Suffice to say she is terrified. On top of that she has never been able to kick the habit, and I imagine prison is the worst place to do it.

I'm hoping that some of you here will be able to give me some advice regarding why my opioid pain medication is no longer controlling my chronic pain adequately. 

Some background info:
First and foremost, I am a legitimate chronic pain patient being prescribed these medications for several chronic medical conditions. I injured my back several years ago, resulting in permanent nerve damage, scar tissue, bone spurs, and other abnormalities that have left me with constant severe lower back pain. I've been to multiple doctors and surgeons over the years and after multiple XRAY's and MRI's, the consensus is that there is nothing that can be operated on at the present time. So, for now, treating the symptoms are my only option.  

In addition,  I have had Fibromyalgia for many years, which means that I live with whole body pain including deep muscle aches, joint aches, severe fatigue, migraines, memory and brain fog, among other symptoms. My body hasn't responded well to traditional fibromyalgia treatments (Cymbalta, other antidepressants) but up until now I have gotten significant benefit from opioids and certain muscle relaxants, namely Soma. I also take Neurontin (gabapentin) which helps some but the benefits are minimal. 

------------------------------
Okay, on to my problem:

I am currently seeing a pain management doctor who has me on MS-Contin (morphine sulfate extended-release) 60Mg taken 3x daily (every 8 hours), as well as morphine sulfate instant release 15Mg taken up to three times a day as needed for breakthrough pain. I have been on these medications at this dosage for approximately a year, and during that time they have worked fairly well, bringing my average pain level down to around a 4 instead of a 6 or 7. Even though this level of pain is still more than I would like, it HAS ALLOWED ME TO GET SOME OF MY LIFE BACK, AND HAS ALLOWED ME TO DO THINGS I COULDN'T DO BEFORE I STARTED OPIOID PAIN MANAGEMENT THERAPY. 

Approximately 6 weeks ago I woke up one morning in very severe pain, which stayed with me through the rest of the day. Basically all of my normal pain was there, but at greatly elevated levels. At the time I assumed that I was just having a rougher than normal day, which is not uncommon for many fibromyalgia patients, since many of us experience significant changes in our pain from day to day and sometimes even hour to hour. Since I am used to having some rough days, I figured that I would feel better the next day. Unfortunately, other than some day to day fluctuation, I have remained at this greatly elevated pain level ever since.

The best way I can describe the way I feel is that I feel like I did before I started pain management. My pain levels feel similar to what they were before I was on opioid therapy. Taking 60Mg of MS-Contin does almost nothing to control my pain, whereas before this mysterious change that happened 6 weeks ago it controlled my pain reasonably well. Even taking my breakthrough pain medication (15Mg IR morphine sulfate) in addition to my extended release MS-Contin doesn't offer me much relief.  Something else I find strange is that my muscle relaxants (Soma) are no longer working very well for me either. They used to be a major benefit in reducing my pain and allowing me to be functional, but their effectiveness seemed to drop off drastically the same time my morphine stopped working. 

I am now in so much pain that I find it difficult to sleep, since I can't find a comfortable position to lay in for more than 30-45 minutes. It takes me a long time to get to sleep due to the pain, and I also wake up frequently during the night due to pain. I often have to move to a recliner chair for better support. 


I am completely baffled as to why my medications are no longer working for me. They are the exact same brands, at the exact same dosages, from the exact same pharmacy. In the opinion of the group, is it more likely that my condition has worsened and the medications are no longer strong enough to control the pain, or is it more likely that I have built a tolerance to the pain medications and my body requires a higher dosage for this reason?? I am no expert in the field of opioids, but it seems unlikely to me that a medication tolerance would occur over night and be this severe. My pain management doctor has also explained to me that it is much more difficult to build a tolerance to medication when it is being used to control legitimate pain. For the record, I don't experience ANY euphoria or other pleasurable side effects for which these medications are often abused.   

At this point I am trying to determine if my major increase in pain is due to a condition change, increased tolerance to my medication, or something else. Would I likely benefit from an increase in my MS-Contin, and if so, how much? Perhaps a different medication like Opana would work better for me? What about staying on my same medications but trying a ""drug holiday""?

Any input on my situation would be greatly appreciated!!

point being, i'm getting unclear info on kicking with methadone. i want to use these 5mg pills ONLY when shit is fucking intolerable, like at night when i can't sleep because my muscles are tense and twitching. i'm ok during the day when i keep busy, just clammy gross.  
  
**my question is this, please answer as clearly as you can ugh i'm an idiot sometimes: will methadone help me through WDs, or will they just postpone them until i stop taking it? let me reword to be sure i'm understood: is shit gonna hit me hard when i'm out of methadone, or will it just ease the process like i hope?** sorry about the dual posting, i'm just kind of freaking out about this because i have nothing going in my life, no friends to speak of and i don't have jack shit to keep my mind occupied through the process which is why i'm doing so shittily with it. the most exciting thing i've done in the last 2 weeks was look for a sewing pattern for parachute pants, not fucking harem pants (trust me, they're not the same), and didn't find the damn thing anyway. the recovery group i chose to attend is not a support, emotional group so i'm just floating around alone here in paranoia ""is this ever going to end?"" land. i would post this in r/opiatesrecovery but i'm not totally into the interactions i've had there so far. i like you people better here.

So this week has been a rough one. I got nearly 65 hours in and have been working nonstop since last Saturday. For financial reasons I was forced to sub out with kratom the past couple days. I barely made it through the last few hours of the afternoon and got absolutely soaked by the surprise thunderstorm that rolled through and shut us down (I do tree work so lightning is a definite no.) The fatass paycheck I received afterward did help everything feel a little bit better.

Obviously, the first thing I did was call my dude and set up an exchange with him right away. Everything's cool and I leave to meet him at our normal spot. I wait there for about 15 minutes broke he calls me and tells me to meet him at the gas station across the street. I roll over, park in front of the building, and he runs over and drops my pickup on my lap. I hand him the money, which I wish I would have had ready because just as I'm doing so he remarks that three state troopers just rolled by. He gets the fuck out real quick after that and I go in to grab a pack of smokes. As I am getting my cigarettes I overhear the people behind m in line saying that the bar down the street is swarmed with troopers. I probably turned ghost white as I took my change and walked out the door. I lit a smoke and cased my surroundings- no LEOs in sight. So I got the fuck out. And through the cut. I went out the back and went a couple miles through side roads before getting on the freeway and coming home. I made it, and by the grace of god. As far as I know my guy just got popped damn near right in front of me, in the same lot he had me waiting in just minutes earlier. As the buyer I was obviously a much lower priority, although many others in my situation have not ended up so lucky. And I got my heroin. Which I blasted a couple lines and smoked a fat chunk of as soon as I got home. Good shit too, worth the extra cash, but maybe not the near jail time.

I still don't know for a fact if he went down. I definitely was cops at the bar I was sitting at, albeit from a block away. I couldn't see whether or not it was him but given circumstance I have a pretty bad feeling it was. I was thinking of calling him via pay phone just for confirmation but I haven't gotten around to doing so. Staying in for the night seemed like the right thing to do. Who knows, I could be making a serious false assumption here. Only time will tell. I couldn't be happier to be wrong right now, but I've got a nasty feeling about this one.

Brothers and sisters under the warm blanket of hedonist bliss, those who share the knowledge that is this biochemical cheat code, be careful. Every trip you take to cop carries with it the possibility of cops. And I feel like that damn near became a reality for me today. ",1372475754.0

so i let my greed take over and called the guy back the next day to go cop for him.  he insisted on riding along but i was like ""no way jose, i'll just give you my phone as collateral"" (stupid ass mistake #1, or wait, not deleting my texts talking with my boy about ripping this dude off was mistake #1...it's really a chicken and the egg thing)  so i get his 150 bucks and fully intend to get his shit and just take like half and throw some b12 in there to cut it.  i had been discussing this via text on my phone with my friend.  then my stupid ass hands him the phone.  ugh i hate myself for doing that.  

so we go to cop.  dude isn't there.  i'm sick and don't feel like waiting.  while we're sitting around dude sends my boy a text from my phone.  sudden realization.  fuck.  he's seen our entire conversation.  but he's just asking for his shit.  we've been gone over an hour and dude is saying it's going to be another hour or 2 and i'm starting to really freak out.  like let's just take this dude back his money and give up.  but my friends are all like ""just wait"".  i'm asking if there's anywhere else to cop.  i just want this shit over with.  

sure we can cop from this other guy but his dope sucks and he doesn't do quantity.  just straight up bags.  i don't care at this point.  i just want my fix and my phone back.  so we go cop from this other guy and the dope fucking suuuuuuucks dick.  and now dude isn't answering our calls or texts.  my friend doesn't want to ride out to where i met him if we don't even know if he's going to be there.  so he just drops me off with all this dudes bags, no phone.  guess what happened next?

i did all the fucking dope.  over the next 12 hours.  it was so shitty i was doing 2 and 3 bags at a time to feel it.    my logic here is my phone is gone forever and i may as well get high.  so i do.  next day dude has gone through my phone and found out where i work, my parents, friends, gfs phone numbers.  he's texting all of them.  threatening my boy,  telling my parents and bosses i robbed him.  FFUUUUU!

so i come up with an evil plan.  i tell everyone my phone was stolen while i was out drinking the night before and that now this guy is trying to extort money out of me for it to be returned.  that's a thing right?  

everyone. believed. me.  i even filed a police report on the dude for stealing my phone.  if i ever see him he is definitely going to kick my ass.  fortunately he lives a town over and doesn't have a car or know where i live.  if he shows up at my work i just call the cops on him i guess.  

so yea.  stupidest shit i've ever done right there.  totally should have left well enough alone and not fucked with dude again.  or not given him my phone.  or deleted my text messages about ripping him off.  or waited on the better dope.  ugh.  so many things went wrong and they were all my fault.  wanna share some of your stupidest moments?

tl;dr: went against my better judgement to serve a guy that overdosed in my house the day before.  did A LOT of stupid shit and sort of accidentally ripped him off.  he did fucking deserve it though.  

also the phone only cost me 30 bucks.  so it's whatever.  i already ordered a new one.  and it looks like i'll be ordering all my gear off SR from now on because my boy is REALLY fucking pissed at me and he was sort of my only connection since my dude got popped a few weeks ago.

A friend and I were walking back from McDonald's and the gas station, drinking a Monster and eating some chips. When we were cut off by a cop car. Two youngins hopped out, and starting asking a million questions. We were both hella respectful, yet they continued pushing, a asking questions, wanting to search us. Finally I spoke up ""Sir, I'd really prefer if you didn't put your hands on me, but I will empty my pockets for you."" The officer agreed. Good idea Bunk_Junk, I thought. So I had my wallet, cigs, lighter, phone, and pocket knife in my hands and laid them out on the sidewalk. The officer then started patting me down, and immediately said ""what's in your watch pocket"". Fuck, he wasn't supposed to do that. 

""Its just a couple prescription percocets,"" I said. ""Why are they different sizes"" asked the officer. I explained that they were different strengths. That's when his cuffs came out, slapped on my wrist, and I was informed that I was being arrested for possession schedule 2. 

One was simply a perc 5 that was given to me (there's no way that would have any effect for me). I planned to use it to barter with. The other was a generic dilly 8. Shit. The cops correctly identified the perc, but continuously called the dilly a 'hydrocodone'. I thought sweet, that's not too bad, maybe they will let me go. 

But I was wrong, yet again. I sat on the curb another 10 mins while they continued talking to my friend. He didn't get arrested, luckily. Then another cop car pulled up and I was informed that my ride had arrived. Well shit, damn, fuck. I'm fucked. 

He tossed me in back of his car and off we went. After getting to the jail, things were pretty routine, nothing exciting. I told every officer that asked that I was not an addict, I don't shoot up, I just had those randomly cause I was in a car wreck a couple weeks earlier. Everyone seemed nice enough, and didn't treat me like a junkie. I held out until I saw the nurse, then I was truthful. Yes, I am addicted to opiates. Yes, I shoot pills. No, I'm not suicidal. I think this was the most brilliant thing that I could have done. This basically guaranteed me at least a 4 or 5 day stay in the medical wing as opposed to general population (who wants to withdraw there anyway). About an hour later the nurse had a handful of pills for me to take: a couple Ibuprofen, colonodine, some sleep aid, and a couple chewable pink pepto. Sweet relief (I honestly wasn't feeling THAT bad, I just kept hamming it up.) I actually recommend this to any of my bropiates (non-users too) out there that may find themselves in troubled water. The medical wing was ten times better than the holding cell or general population.

I scored a bag, & my ROA is IV.

My question is, do you think my tolerance has gone down enough to where I cant do my normal dose? I don't want to risk OD.. so im kind of scared.

I might also add, I took 1 8mg suboxone thursday morning. So its been 48hours+ since.

Any info provided would be really appreciated. I really don't wanna OD, but I feel like i could probably still do my normal dose considering its only been 4-5 days. 

Anyone with experience, please give me insight. Thank you! ",1372567191.0

So spare me).","I brought a 100ct box in with me, I have been trying to nurse every single one through the last several months and by my own cout I've done a pretty good job.  Sadly though, natural attrition has taken its toll and I am getting down towards the end of the barrel.  Something I've noticed is that as a syringe gets re-used again and again it becomes harder to push through over time and that the problem is with the actual needle itself.  I can trim/change plungers and have the exact same problem of resistance.  After every shot I clear the entire barrel at least twice w/ 90% rubbing alcohol, once with water, and again with a splash of alcohol and air to try and leave the interior needle barrel dry.  Is there aything I can do to increase the throughput for these aged pins?  ",1372557087.0

That day should've been my last - at least that's how I planned it.

Enter stage right my friend - unexpectedly. What the fuck is he doing here? Just go the fuck away and leave me alone. He takes the gun from my hands and replaces it with a needle.

My back is stiff as hell and feels like it is on fire, it feels like I was hit by a car while I was sleeping.  My hips ache, the pain is pounding.  Every heart beat I have reminds me I am alive, but also reminds me I am fucking hurting.  I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, wondering how the hell I am going to get through this day.  I gotta piss, but the bathroom seems so far away when every step feels like ten.  Alarm has gone off three times.  Snooze is my friend, my only friend at 6am.  My wife rolls over, she is one of those people who is angry when they wake up unexpectedly.  She is starting to stir.  Don’t want to wake her up because I am hurting too much to get out of bed. 

 I suck it up and roll out from under the covers.  “Fuck, my hips hurt.  Back hurts worse.”  Gotta decide what to do first, piss or pills?  The pisser is close, the pills are across the house.  Pisser it is.  As I walk past the mirror, I see my eyes are bloodshot all to hell, can’t even open them all the way because they are so dry.  “God, my piss stinks”.  It’s so yellow it’s orange.  I need to drink more water.  These pills are dehydrating the fuck out of me.  

Walk to my office across the house, my man cave if you will.  Very little work actually gets done in there.  “Where did I put those pills?”  I switch locations in the office to keep my wife from finding them all the time.  She knows I take them, she knows I am prescribed them, but if she kept up with them she would realize how many I take and how many I have to buy on the street to keep withdrawals at bay.  “There they are.”  

I put them behind our wedding photo, we were both smiling, happy.  Once upon a time we lived the fairy tale.  Life finally took that from us, or maybe the pills did it.  In my mind, life gave me the pain, pain gave me the pills.  You think painkillers only cost money?  That’s funny.  These dones, oxys, blues, pandas…they cost more than money.  Nobody tells you they take your motivation, your sex drive and pretty much anything else you hold dear as down payment.  “Fuck it.”  No time for introspection.  Gotta get ready for work, get the kiddos ready for school and kiss my wife goodbye.  No time to feel sorry for myself.  No time for help, hell, no time to even cry for help.

Take my last three dones.  I look at that empty bottle and dread starts to creep in to the pit of my stomach.  The empty bottle looks back at me and laughs.  “How the fuck am I out already?!?”  Damnit.  Had a bad day?  Take an extra done.  Going out with my buddies?  Take an extra.  Going to my In-laws for dinner?  Better know I am taking three extra that night.  “Fuck me.”  The rollercoaster begins.  The dones are settling in.  I am starting to feel better, the pain is melting away and I can smile again.  Just in time too, the family is waking up.  Gotta put on my happiest face for my kids.  I don’t want them to know how addicted their dad is.  Morning routine is done, jump in the car, ready to start my day.  My first stop is to CVS.  I have to get some Lope, cause the pain killers I took, 30mg of the pharmacy's finest is going to be gone before lunch.  I always wonder, does the cashier know about my habit when I walk up with a 200ct Lope and a box of Tagamet?  Who knows...and fuck ‘em if they judge me.

Hop in the car with my junkie survival kit courtesy of my local pharmacy and head out to work.  Make a few calls, send a few texts out to my connects.  A rag tag group of the most unreliable, jerk ass people I know.  It’s funny really.  Two years ago, I wouldn’t have said two words to some of these people.  Now I am on the phone, trying to charm them, begging them and treating them better than I treat my own flesh and blood.  After I call, I think of all the things I have to do this week that I can’t imagine doing without some opiate therapy.  Kid’s soccer game, date night with the wife, big project at work…the list goes on.  The place I am in and my need for pills leads this godless man to do the one thing he never does……..pray.
