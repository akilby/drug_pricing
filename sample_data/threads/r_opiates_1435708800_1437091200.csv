I went from full blow heroin addict to clean  to back to being an addict because now I need pain relief.  My muscles in my leg broke down on me due to stressing it at work. and I started doing dope to cope with how physically demanding the job was.  Around that time and as luck would have it my muscles  breaking down caused my kidneys to fail and when they did my blood work they found heroin.  So now I'm blacklisted from any sort of pain relief but every fucking day of my life my leg aches.  I can't sleep and it's pretty goddamn awful.  My kidneys are cleared so I can take opiates without my kidneys being in danger but now nobody will help with my pain because heroin showed up in my blood.  I know.

Or at least that‚Äôs what I tell myself, and once you believe something so immaterial it may as well be true.  I guess.  When I‚Äôm on the road, I feel like I‚Äôm escaping somehow ‚Äì literally putting distance between myself and my problems.  Small town living has it‚Äôs charms, but somehow a certain paranoia grips you, tells you, threatens you ‚Äì *everyone knows* ‚Äì you can tell by the way they look at you. Maybe.  Sometimes you convince yourself that it all really is a delusion, that its narcissistic to think anyone would bother thinking about you at all, at least those with no reason to. Whenever I drive into a bustling city, its as if my pores open up and relieve my blood pressure straight through the bottom of my feet.  I thrive on the anonymity.  The possibility to be stupid in a very public way and then never see those people again. Catharsis.



Despite all that, I rarely find myself too far from my suffocating mountain existence.  Day in, day out. Mostly I‚Äôm too broke and too cowardly to truly leave.  I don‚Äôt understand life outside of these mountains.  Too impersonal and in your face.  I like knowing who my neighbors are and that they don‚Äôt care that I have marijuana plants growing on my  - *well, nevermind that..*  Life never really worked out for me in any traditional sense. Mid 30‚Äôs now, no wife, no kids, no long term or short term significant other.  Always a loner, not by choice by really, more like by default.  I certainly wouldn‚Äôt have chosen this.



Our tale begins around spring of 2002.  I was kicked out of college for academic reasons after my freshman year.  I was 19 years old. Raised by an alcoholic and a passive-aggressive codependent enabler (from here on out known as the PACE). Scratch that. I was raised by my grandparents while the alcoholic and the PACE satisfied their thirst for money.  We weren‚Äôt rich by any means, no yachts or Ferraris, but considering the cost of living in Appalachia, and that both my parents held college degrees, we were better off than most.  



I was (still am) awkward and strange throughout childhood.  Very quiet and aloof.  ‚ÄúBackwards,‚Äù in hillbilly speak. Quarr.  I was an only child and most of my childhood was spent with the strange characters that made up my ‚Äúneighborhood.‚Äù  They aren‚Äôt really relevant to this story, other than to say that most all of them ended up like me, which is to say, completely fucked up. 



But I digress. Spring. 2002. College.  I scrambled to find a job as I knew I was failing all my classes in the Spring semester.  It was the first time in my life I felt like I had done something truly ‚Äúbad.‚Äù I felt enormous guilt for wasting my parents‚Äô money on two semesters of college that I spent mostly smoking weed and playing PS2.  And they didn‚Äôt hesitate to let me know about it.  The alcoholic complains about it to this day.  Fortuitously, I landed a job at the only factory in my hometown.  I won‚Äôt say much about what the factory manufactured, to retain my anonymity, but it was, basically, a clothing factory.  I soon found that the work was mind numbing. Terrible, repetitive, boring.  No opportunity for creativity or problem solving or the necessity to actually think.  Just mindless tasks.  For eight dollars an hour I had sold myself out as a meat robot.  A prescient drone whose ability to think was an unfortunate side effect of my otherwise decent aptitude at moving fabric around.  In other words, it quickly became my own private hell (I‚Äôd imagine the other 100 or so people that worked there felt similarly, given what they got up to).



But, but! There was a bright side.  Not more than a week after I started my job at the factory, I ran into a girl I went to high school with.  A pretty blonde girl.  A former cheerleader.  I was about to celebrate my daily dose of freedom from mindless tyranny with a nice joint, and she wanted to join me! Holy hell. Maybe life wasn‚Äôt so bad.  We had a smoke, talked, bonded, and so on.  We went our separate ways after maybe an hour and a half.  I was ecstatic.  This girl was way out of my league.  I got her digits, and it became our daily thing to blaze up when I got off work.



This went on for a couple weeks.  I was so happy.  A girl, not just a girl, but a girl who seemed to want to spend time with me.  This was a foreign concept to me.  But, I quickly noticed, she wasn‚Äôt truly interested in me, she just wanted free weed.  However, and I can thank my opioid receptors for this I imagine, I was addicted to her.  I couldn‚Äôt let it go. I became the ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù that just kept doing things for the pretty girl because she was pretty.  Within weeks my mind completely went to pieces.  I hadn‚Äôt gotten so much as a kiss, but I made sure I had some weed every day so she would come hang with me.  I gave her joints to take with her when she left if she asked for them.  I took major risks just to make sure everything was perfect for her.  All she had to do was ring, and I came running.  It was pathetic.



Once, on a Friday, I went to make my weekly weed pickup.  I usually bought an ounce on payday.  But, when I got to the turnoff to where my hookup lived, I found that the road to his house was completely flooded from heavy rains during the week. ‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù I thought.  There‚Äôs another way to his place.  So I circled around to drive up to his place from the other side.  I found that side was flooded as well.  A semi-large cornfield with a gravel road running down the middle.  Completely flooded.  I said fuck it and decided I could make it.  I was driving a Jeep Wrangler after all.  So I drove through the flooded field and eventually made it to his house.  Needless to say he was surprised to see me.  I got my ounce and went on my way.  Got to keep baby happy.  When the water receded the next week I drove in to the hookup‚Äôs place the back way again, for no particular reason.   I discovered that there was a small bridge at the edge of the cornfield.  I had crossed it during the flood, purely by chance.  I had no idea it was there.  I had blindly crossed it perfectly, twice.



Eventually the situation turned truly outrageous.  Cheerleader girl was pretending to go to college in a town about a 50 minute drive away.  On days when she would let me, I would drive all the way up there just to hang with her for a few minutes and blaze up.  But, unsurprisingly, I found out that she was hanging out with a lot of people at college, and getting into some serious partying.  I was a total greenhorn at this point, a noob, wet-behind-the-ears.  I had got my drink on plenty of times, and liked to smoke, but I had never done anything serious.  When I found out she was getting into some real shit, I was angry about it ‚Äì and broken hearted that she was partying with someone else.  God, what was I thinking?  Around the same time, a lot of people I knew were expressing very serious concerns that what I had been up to was utterly stupid, and they were right.  But, I was too stubborn to listen.



This being Appalachia, not a lot of street drugs make the rounds here.  Around here, it had always been about pills.  I was afraid of pills.  I had tried two drugs at this point in my life ‚Äì alcohol and weed (not counting tobacco).  I loved them both.  Weed in particular.  I figured if I tried other drugs I would love those too.  I was right.  I knew plenty of people who took pills, particularly since I‚Äôd been working at the factory.  Some guys I was kind of friends with at work had tried to get me to try some before, but I had always refused.  One Friday night though, when Cheerleader girl was off doing her college thing and I was feeling particularly sorry for myself, one of the guys offered me a Xanax.  Blue football, gg258.  I ate it and didn‚Äôt think anything happened.  I was non-plussed.  I went home that night wondering why everyone loved pills so much.



I woke up the next morning though feeling like a new man.  I had gotten the best night‚Äôs rest I had ever felt in my life.  I awoke energized. Refreshed.  I didn‚Äôt know it was possible to feel this good in the morning.  I immediately attributed this to the Xanax, and within a couple of hours was calling my friends from work, trying to get more.  I was hooked. Overnight.  But Xanax is a hard drug to find for a guy with few connections, not to mention living in the middle of nowhere.  It was days before I was able to get more. And I got ripped off no less than twice before I finally scored.  A fresh face in the dope game.  An idiot.  Also, in the meantime, while I was thirsting for more footballs and coming up empty, one of the guys from work had offered me a 10mg hydrocodone.  I didn‚Äôt just take it, I snorted my part after he divvied it up. I was quickly in love.  People around here will snort anything.  People around here will snort 54-142 methadones, hell I‚Äôve snorted 54-142 methadones (it burns like a motherfucker).



To no one‚Äôs surprise, Cheerleader girl and I immediately began to do other drugs together.  We snorted mountains worth of pink Lortab 910 powder, for the love of a decent high and a really chalky drain.  She began to talk more and more about poorly thought out and strange ideas.  She always claimed to be saving her money to buy a new car of some kind (a Hyundai Tiburon maybe? I‚Äôm having trouble remembering).  She would blather on about it all the time, exactly what color she wanted (black, I think), the interior color, yadda, yadda.  If I suggested a different model, or buying a used car for less money, she would get angry.  Outraged that I wasn‚Äôt blindly going along with her whims.  I was way past running out of patience, and good sense was well outside the focus of the rear-view mirror.



I was also running out of money, and quick.  I was, if I could find them, trying to keep a stock of at least 3 Lortab 10‚Äôs and 3mg of Xanax for myself for every work day.  I would keep pills crushed up beside my alarm clock at night and blow them before I even got out of bed in the morning.  Then do more throughout the day at work.  Plus I was keeping Cheerleader girl high.  Plus whatever I did on weekends. Days at work when I couldn‚Äôt find any Lortabs were hell.  Nights without Xanax were spent wide-eyed and paranoid.  I remember one day at work, me and the guy who gave me that first Xanax were both fiending for something, anything to get us through the day.  He was checking with everyone he knew within the factory.  Eventually he came back and told me the only thing he could find was something called methadone, and it was $10 for a pill.  ‚ÄúFuck it, go get us some‚Äù I said and handed him a $20.  He came back with some 10mg white methadone pills.  Stamped 54-142.  Neither of us had any idea what they really were.  We both immediately headed to the bathroom and crushed them up in the checkstubs we kept in our back pockets and snorted them with the tooters we kept in our change pockets.  I remember him saying something like, ‚Äúgoddamn man, is that burning you up?‚Äù
	


‚ÄúIt feels like my eye is gonna melt out of my head,‚Äù I said.



One day Cheerleader girl claimed she finally had almost enough money for her new Hyundai.  At this point I barely cared.  She said her dad was going to help her with the rest or something.  I remember she showed up at my house in a brand new Hyundai that was red.  I immediately questioned why she hadn‚Äôt gotten the color she had said she wanted for the last 6 months.  ‚ÄúThis was the only new one they had on the lot,‚Äù she said.  I was appalled that someone who had saved money for something for that long would go out and not get exactly what they wanted.  An argument started when I stated my opinions.  Finally I asked her if she was going to take me for a ride in her new car, and she did.  But we continued arguing and I finally decided I had had enough.  It would be nearly ten years before I saw her again.

Dunno what to do with myself, not sick, but I'm getting that itch. So, of course i lined myself something to pick up as soon as i got off (thank god for people willing to leave packages behind while they sleep).


But I'm getting antsy, i know it's coming and i want it to happen faster. Work is pretty damn slow and my supervisor happens to be off tonight so i figured maybe i can get away with some mischief..


I went ahead and told the lead guy  (who is barely 2 weeks into this job) that i had a doctors appt real early i forgot about and asked if i could leave early. Of course he wouldn't say no, he's new and weak. I know i can get away with quite a bit with him at the helm.


So, i decided i was gonna leave at 4 am instead of 6 am. Not too bad considering i wasn't going to get shit done anyway. Now, with this knowledge i approach a coworker with similar habits as mine and mention I'm grabbing something after work. Of course he wants some for himself. I can see his brain ticking just like mine, trying to get to that sweet opiate embrace as soon as he can.


More boredom ensues at my job and i get even more restless. I'm feeling bold, ""let's see what we can get away with"", my brain decides. So, i come up with a brilliant plan to finish up my work as soon as possible, sneak out of work and have this coworker clock me out when i was supposed to have been clocked out around 4 am. The. Brilliance in the plan being that my supervisor isn't here and no one is really going to notice me.


I ask my coworker my plan and he's hesitant. He wants the dope, but don't want to get in trouble. But also, he owes me. So, of course he caves in, provided i bring him back stuff ASAP of course. Fair enough. A conspiracy is made.


It's 1 am now and I'll probably be sneaking out by 1:30. Here's to hoping i don't get busted and get high.


I'm not really sure what the point of this was other than to kill time before i could make my run, but you guys have a great night!

I know next to nothing about the dark net in regards to using it(and pretty much getting to it..) and whatnot but I know Silk Road got busted quite some time back now, then Silk Road 2.0 got busted or was like an FBI trap or something? And a bunch of other sites popped up but they were either scams, the feds, or simply not as good or reputable as Silk Road was. Is it still like this or is there a go-to reputable quality site y'all use for Opiates? Again, if you wish to share where, just PM me or whatever, don't post it here.

I'm interested because the stuff I get now is expensive for what it is and not that good. I rarely even get high off it even more. I would much rather drop $300ish for some super super high quality stuff I only need a dime of to get to nodnodland.

I've been trying to use codeine recreationally (light opiate, I know). Anyhow, I use Kratom regularly which I know binds to the Mu opiate receptors, it's active ingredient being 7-hydroxymitragynine. Anyhow, I've been dosing as high as 150 recently for recreational purposes and while I have found it pleasant, I haven't experienced ""nodding"" described by others of opiate use. 

Before when I was taking Codeine more oftenly I would be combining up to 150 mg Codeine w/ k-pins. Still didn't experience nodding. on other occasions I was dosing (orally) up to 10 mgs of hydromorphone to similar non-nodding results. 

Since 150 is the highest I've dosed and I haven't experienced the nod, and I haven't had any real concern about respiratory depression, or CNS suppression, is it possible my body is just naturally tolerant to Opiates? Should I be ""safe"" to up my dose to 200-220 realm? 

My concern is if I do it ""gradually"" over several doses that I will simply increase my tolerance as I progress and never really get there. 

I just don't get it, because aside from Kratom, I only started using codeine (again) about 1.5 weeks ago, so I should be ""relatively"" opiate naive. I guess cross tolerance might be an issue w/ the Kratom. Regardless, do you think I can safely up my dose by 60-75 mgs or so?

I should also mention they are being taken in the form of Codeine Sulfate pills so doseage is accurate, not subject to dilution from CWE. 

Hoping I can get some answers shortly as I'm ready to dose. :) Thanks for any opinions you provide. ",1435720275.0

To shoot UK gear you have to add acid to the shot, which at times can mean you add slightly too much and get a shot that burns a little. If you're hitting larger veins it's not really a problem, but when you're going for the tiny little ones you can feel the burn for a while, presumably until the shot has mixed with enough blood that its's no longer too acidic.

So with that in mind, would windmill-ing your arms around after a hand shot be a good idea? As in would it force new blood into the area (effectively pushing the shot out into your system faster), or would it slow down how quickly the shot gets out of your hands?

Junkie Jesus smiled on me. .. after the first two rounds of 1 mg dilauded (neither did shit for the pain, so they gave me 4mg of morphine, yum! ).

I got a call from someone in Drug Court today telling me it was diluted. If they send this test off to the lab are they going to be able to tell I used?

I know there are conflicted opinions of tea on this forum, but I want to keep this as objective as possible.

So I used to dabble in painkillers and poppy tea towards the end of last year. Usually, 1.5 to 2 cups of seeds would get me nice and high. Fast forward to now, I have 5lbs of seeds from my old source. I tested the potency of the seeds with a one cup brew a few days ago. I was kinda dissapointed and figured they were bunk. Barely any buzz and I have no tolerance. 

So anyways, a couple of days ago I decided to return to my old dose of two cups. This time, however, I washed the seeds twice.  used grapefruit juice and lemon juice. Finished the two wash brew around noon. I felt a buzz in about 20 minutes, but it didn't build an hour later so I went with a one cup brew. I sat around for a few hours watching Breaking Bad and waiting for it to kick in.

After a few hours, I accepted that the seeds were not very potent and smoked some weed. 15 minutes later I was starting to nod, and had flashes of nausea. I even had difficulty peeing, which is a side effect I had never experienced. I know tea takes a while to kick in, but what gives? Did weed potentiate it? 

TL;DR drank a lot of poppy tea, waited a few hours, smoked weed, instantly hits me",1435850978.0

Once a week, I take 200mg of tramadol and 120mg of codeine phosphate early in the morning before work to experience a 5-6 hour buzzy euphoric feeling. It makes me feel really, really good. If I take anymore, I get quite a bit dizzy and would have trouble walking straight...  and from that I guess you can tell I'm sort of new to opiates(?). I've been doing this for a month. I don't feel any withdrawal (except towards the end of the day of ingestion, I feel really drained and shitty until I go to sleep), and don't do opiates on any other days - it's just once a week.

My question is, would this eventually cause addiction requiring me to take more pills? I stick to once a week because I work with this one guy who's in on just that one day... and I like him. The opiates, I discovered by accident, just make me melt around him... . It's the only thing I have to look forward to in the whole week. Plus the euphoric buzz is just...  incredible, the best thing ever, and out of this world. I don't drink (expect a couple of units/week or smoke (anything) and have never done any other drugs.

I couldnt post it till today for some reason.,"Finally made a throwaway, I've been lurken around my favorite sub for too long now and it's time to contribute, if I'm bad at that, let me know and I'll go back to just creeping.  

       Today was supposed to be the day I started a methadone maintenance program. It's first come first serve starting at 530 am, I woke up on time and just stared at the clock on my phone until I knew it was too late. What the fuck? I want to kick heroin, it's time, I was clean 16 hours, ready to do the 4 hour intake procedure, had the cash knowing medi cal will cover the rest. So what do I do I just don't get up, I literally stared at my phone till I knew it was too late to make it. Now I'm starting to feel sick, body aches, hacking, running nose, blah, blah you know the rest. Not to mention feeling pretty shitty about myself and my lack of motivation this morning. 
           Fucking shit, it's 545 in the morning no one will answer. So there I was scrapping old tooters for resin, digging through layers of old foil, looking at every old tiny piece of plastic my tar came in, (all already cleaned) turning my skin black with ash in the mean time. 45 minutes Bam. Just a tiny bowl for me to smoke, enough to get me out bed and into the world. I get one hit, and you know I held that fucker in for as long as possible. It works a little. I Lay in bed on reddit for a few more hours, feeling bummed. I smoke a couple bong loads, eat a 2mg k-pin and hit the road. 
          Already starting to feel a little shitty again I head to my buddies house this is my best friend basically my brother from way back before chemicals became our third best buddy. It's just normal we get together so we can team up and score a bigger possibly cheaper sack. I just needed to make it till the day after tomorrow, so I can actually get in the methadone clinic. My buddy too, he recently stopped going. He's tried every route of detox, rehab, therapy, in patient and out, and multiple stents at the methadone clinics. This last time the dose they gave him wasn't enough for him so he decided to disappear and start shooting up again :/ my brother is another story.  I'm positive I'll be going this time. Tired of the people I deal with and being so broke and putting myself in shitty situations. That's the game though. Anyways so  for me 1-1.5 grams will be perfect. My buddy is a poker, I'm a smoker (I know, I know) but it works out (all though I'm always worried about him, he really pushes it sometimes, especially when we have lots of benzos around.) between the two of us we can usually pick up a couple grams for a good price, with a few choices of dealers all with-in an hour. So no problem right. 
          Fuck my life. All my hooks are dry. We live in Southern California near the border, this never never happens. If I don't score it's because I'm too late or someone doesn't answer the phone, never because someone's out. Worst case I wait an hour for my dude to re-up. Now my buddies calling people and the first couple hooks same story, ""all out man"" One real OG dude, like my man sells a couple pieces a day (A Piece is Mexican weight, about 25grams) working from 9-430, this is an old guy, probably was slanging liquor during prohibition or some thing, tells us sad news, it's been hot down at the border the last few days and some of the bigger suppliers got caught up. FUCK, why did I skip going to the clinic today. So we put our heads together start figuring shit out. I feel shitty and the beer I just drank just made me nauseous, so I did what anyone would do and hit up my homie for a half gram of crystal. I know it will help us get through the day probably the night, in ok shape if we can't pick up, also it's still pretty early and I'm with my best friend so that'll be chill. White usually takes my mind off of w/d symptoms for a little while at least. 
    
       Now I'm fucking twaked as my tolerance is pretty low. My buddy uses more often so he's chilling. We start calling last resorts and middles that are in our phones some under dumb code names we made at the time and now don't remember who they are.  :( still not much luck. Finally a middle answers, she reliable and chill, I've dealt with her a few times and I trust her. I also don't have to worry about things in my car going ""missing"". Which is always nice. The day started at 8am-ish and at 630 we have a hook. Fuck yes! (I know that doesn't seem like long, but being by Mexico it is for me, I'm just not used to it, and I'm truly sorry if I come of as ungrateful or snobby. I realize how lucky I am) anyways, she and her man hop in and we head about 10 minutes to get it. Prices around here are pretty consistent as you can imagine but I'm paying about 20$ more that usual per gram. I don't care at this point though, as I'm not going home with out some dope. We get to the place and like typical when your desperate the dope dude stops answering for 30 mins, we had just talked to him 5 mins before getting to the meet up spot. Guy calls, he nodded out, I figured such. The middle is off into the distance to meet the dude. A beautiful and anxious site. Five minutes later she's back. Yessssss! I throw it on the scale, it's 1.03 with the bag. Awhhh fuck me man, I paid for 1.5 grams at a 35% markup. The middle texts the dude, and as expected no reply. I know I'm shit out of luck. I break off my buddy a couple points, give the middle a couple points and smoke a decent bowl. Throw it on the scale again now it's .56 wellll fuck. The good news I smoke a lot less while on white. I know I can make that last till tomorrow. My main dude said he'll be good, I'll grab a half hold me over till Friday start methadone maintenance and start the process once more. I think I said all that out loud because the middles boyfriend speaks for the first time and says, "" oh the clinic will be closed Friday for intakes because the holiday"" fuck you man. Fuck. I didn't hate the guy, he was actually pretty chill, but that fucked my plan all up. Now I gotta figure out a way to make it till Monday. I'm praying junkie Jesus will come to my aid with money and dope, but like usual it's just the dope that's around.
    
       It's almost 8 o'clock at this point, and I finally have a little black. Drop everyone off and start my 45 minute drive home. Time to do the dance all over again tomorrow. Man I love and hate this drug so much. I can do any drug I want and not get hooked like this, but heroin, heroin takes your heart and soul and doesn't let go till you make it. At least for me. Fucking slutty sexy bitch. 
    
      I hope everyone is having good luck and safe and easy pick ups. I also hope everyone is being as safe as possible out there. 
    
     Holy fuck! this is long. Oh yeah, it's that crystal. Haha if you read all this and think it's a bunch of shit or irrelevant I do apologize but at the same time thank you because I just wanted to vent to someone, Or /r/opiates. It's hard to find good ""friends"" in this game. But even from just reading what you guys post each night, I feel content. Some of you guys are fucking fantastic writers, not just this rambling I'm doing lol.  Oh yeah, and I'm probably high as hell reading with one eye closed. I love to write so maybe I'll make some more thought out posts. 


And just a side note, I know to many, this day I described might just be a walk in the park, but a lot of negative, non drug things are going on in my life making every task a huge event and today was rough one for me.
   I'm out for now, peace my fellow fiends, much love to each and every one of you. <3 nod away

I am currently on a 10-12 norco 1 bar a day habit and haven't taken a day off in 2 years since I tried going cold and made it a couple of months before falling back to old habits. The AWD weren't nearly as bad as the PAWS which I eventually gave into. Am a trust fund kid but don't want the family to know, they figure something is going on with the way I chew through cash. But I'm tired of burning 25k or more a year and was wondering if y'all's experience could provide me incite to if subox is a good option to me, talk to doc for a serious wean and med plan to get me through paws or if it's time to bite the bullet and pay for rehab. At this point I'm just maintaining and don't get high and afraid of the next step if I continue down this path since I'm about to come into more money?

3bulca,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3bulca/tales_from_appalachia_part_2/,6,https://redd.it/3bulca,Alt_Small_Man,"Tales from Appalachia, part 2","With Cheerleader girl out of the picture, things improved for me, money-wise.  I had found a small beacon of light in the factory work as well.  I was allowed the use of headphones during work.  So I bought a Disc-man and began to spend 8 hours a day listening to new music.  Every weekend I would go out and buy forty or fifty dollars worth of CDs and spend the next week at work listening to my new music. Which is great when you‚Äôre also really high all day. I have always been a fan of psychedelic rock and progressive rock type things.  I was in about 6th grade when Pink Floyd‚Äôs *Division Bell* was released.  For weeks on end the Alcoholic had played that album around the house and Pink Floyd has been my favorite band ever since.  With my new avenue for musical exploration, I soon became a fan of many more progressive bands as well.  Soon, I discovered the Grateful Dead, Phish, Tool, Radiohead, and the fantastic back catalog of many others.  I began to make sure I saved all my sick days at the factory so I could travel to as many shows as possible.  Relatively speaking, life was almost good.  I was still in the ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù period with the drugs, and had faced few, if any, consequences for my recklessness.  I was becoming emboldened by my new lifestyle, which, as most of you probably know, is a dangerous mindset for the youthful maniac.

However, I was quickly spiraling out of control, a fact that I was completely oblivious to.  Lazily, I had always chalked my lack of luck with the ladies up to my doughy body, rather than my much more off-putting personality and lack of social ability.  So, I had started to diet somewhat compulsively when Cheerleader girl began hanging around.  I found out later, when I started with the pills, that opiates make it a little easier (okay, a lot easier) to eat less.  So by the time Cheerleader girl and I parted ways, I was barely eating at all.  I had practically become anorexic.  Most days my diet consisted of Lortab, Xanax, coffee, Mountain Dew, and maybe ‚Äì *maybe* ‚Äì a bologna sandwich sometime throughout the day.  Since I had began working at the factory I had lost nearly 100 lbs..  Many days I consumed no solid food at all.  On top of that, I was barely sleeping.  As I was a relative newbie to opiates and benzos, I could get a pretty great buzz from relatively small doses.  I found that hydrocodone gave me a fantastic energy boost, and that it didn‚Äôt matter how late I stayed up at night, I could happily go to work the next day as long as I had my little helpers.  

A friend that lived just down the road from me would come by most evenings.  He had been in some kind of car wreck a year or two prior, and was getting a monthly prescription to Lortab 7.5‚Äôs.  Every night we would shoot pool until 2 or 3am.  I had grown a semi-large quantity of weed the previous summer and kept most of it for my own personal use.  So, on each game we would put up a bet ‚Äì *a joint of my homegrown weed and one of his Lortab*.  I had to be at work at 7am every weekday morning, so I was lucky to get 4 hours of sleep most nights. Almost every afternoon when I got off work I would come home and sit down on the couch and light a cigarette.  And, nearly everyday, I would nod off before I finished said cigarette, only to be awakened vigorously by the Alcoholic screaming about how I was going to burn the house down.

I was quickly becoming the poster child of the angry young man.  I truly believed that I was living my life exactly as I wanted to and that anybody who had a problem with it was just a fuckin square, *man*.  I believed I had been lied to.  I believed that there was no down side to my hedonism, and that any and all arguments against drug use and abuse were without merit.  I mean, hell, I was having *fun* man. I disregarded my own increasing lack of control, my rage at anyone who questioned me or told me I was wrong, and the unbelievably volatile and annoying mannerisms I took on when I was feeling ‚Äúgood.‚Äù  The people at the factory who knew what was up with me, which, no doubt, was most of them, began referring to me as ‚ÄúYoung [insert my name here].‚Äù I didn‚Äôt really understand what they were getting at, at the time.  I get it now.

So things hummed along fairly quietly for a while.  I was doing my thing, every day that I could, and keeping up appearances ‚Äì or so I thought ‚Äì at work.  I suspect the only reason I was tolerated was that I showed up pretty much every day, and did my work without too much fuss.  Outside of work there were a few incidents.  For a time, I began hanging regularly with a friend whom I had gone to High School with, incidentally, the same friend with whom I had smoked my first joint. For the purposes of this story, let‚Äôs call him Dee.  Dee lived in a neighboring county, with his girlfriend, in a small house that, weirdly, had been constructed from two house-trailers, which he rented.  I soon became familiar with the regular gang of crazies that frequented Dee‚Äôs place looking for a place to party for a few hours or a heads up on where they might score whatever they were looking for.  I even got in with a few dealers that lived in the area.  

One evening, some guys stopped by Dee‚Äôs place. There were two of them, they were brothers. I had met these guys a couple times before, so we were more or less friendly. One of them asked if we had a hookup on any painkillers.  I knew a guy less than a mile away who was selling Lortab 10‚Äôs for $8 apiece and I offered to help them out, free of charge.  I was handed a $100 bill and told to go get as many I as I could.  The bill looked a little rough, as if it had been left in a pants pocket and run through the washing machine, but, whatever.  So I went, made the pickup, and turned over the stuff when I got back.  Eventually this guy, after thumbing through his money, asks if I‚Äôll go pick him up some more of those tabs.  He hands me another rough looking $100 and I make the run.  Whatever.

The next day was payday for me.  For lack of a better source, I drove up to the neighboring county to see if any of those Lortabs were left at the place I had picked up the night before.  I made the trip immediately when I got off work.  When I got there and knocked on the door, a small, old-ish, lady answered the door and seemed very surprised by my presence.  She beckoned for someone in the house and a short, stout, barrel-chested guy appeared at the door. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù he demanded.

‚ÄúUm, I was wondering if you guys had any more of those tabs..?‚Äù I was thoroughly confused by what was going on.

‚ÄúWhat about that money?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat money,‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúThe fake money you brought here last night.  We got suspicious when one of them pretty much broke into two pieces after you left here last night.  Hang on, I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù  He waved me in and told the old woman to get the two $100 bills.  One of them looked as if it had been torn perfectly down the middle.  ‚ÄúLook at these bills man, they both have the same serial number,‚Äù he said, pointing at the bills.  Sure enough, they both had the same number.  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre a little smaller than a real bill, too,‚Äù he added.  It was obvious that these were the bills I had paid with the night before. I didn‚Äôt doubt it at all.  ‚ÄúSo, what are you gonna do about it?‚Äù he started asking, remembering that he was supposed to be angry.  I mumbled a few words about so-and-so sending the money with me, clearly this guy wasn‚Äôt interested.  I remembered I had just gotten paid.

‚ÄúWell, um, I guess,‚Äù I began counting money in my wallet.  I produced a stack of twenties that totaled up to $200.  ‚ÄúHere ya go man. This is the best I can do. Sorry about that.‚Äù Suddenly, both he and the old woman were supportive. 

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù he said, calling the old woman by a name that I don‚Äôt recall, ‚Äúsee if you got any more of those tabs for this guy.‚Äù  The old woman produced eight Lortab 10‚Äôs from her purse.  I added $56 to the stack of twenties, my blood beginning to boil.  The old woman began to feel a bit of pity for me, I guess, along with her surprise that she was getting her money back.  She began asking what I was going to do to get my money back.  I told her that I wasn‚Äôt sure yet, but that I would do something, and for her not to worry about it.  I headed out.

I really didn‚Äôt know what I was going do, but the anger and panic was growing enormously in my head.  *Those motherfuckers*.  I just spent $256 on 8 fucking Lortabs.  Its only Friday and I‚Äôm now basically broke.  How the hell am I going stay well for work all next week?  *Sonofabitch*. I immediately began driving towards the evil-doers house, unsure of what I would do when I got there.  Despite my affinity for verbal abuse at times, I‚Äôm not much for violence. At least not against people.  Certain inanimate objects such as TV remotes and cellular telephones have felt my wrath before, but I had never really been in a fight.  What the hell was I going to do when I got there?

As it turned out, when I got there, I found the evil-doers' mother sitting alone in her living room; the thieves were nowhere to be found.  I told their mother what they had done to me (that‚Äôll show ‚Äòem!), but for some reason I took pity on them and didn‚Äôt reveal the details of the buy.  I told her that they had sent me to pick up weed for them, because I knew that she knew they smoked.  By the next day I got word that they were looking for me! As if they had a beef with me!  I didn‚Äôt go to the neighboring county that day though.  Yeah, I know. I‚Äôm spineless.

I just moved, and I'm using the move as a way to kind of kickstart getting clean. I've used off and on for a few years, and the last time I quit I had been using for a few months pretty much continuously, and stopping cold took about 5 days or a week before the worst of it was over and then another week or so to feel pretty much back to normal. My problem is I start work in about 5 or 6 days and I don't want to be having serious withdrawals right when I'm starting a new job.

I've got a pretty decent supply of 5 mg OxyContin (about 30) and I'm wondering what the best way to use those to slowly taper down my usage would be. I understand that there is no way to avoid things completely, but if possible I'd like to minimize the symptoms as much as possible.

How would I go about titrating my dosage to make sure that I'm not really sick when I start work around July 6th? I might also possibly be able to acquire some amount of suboxone, but that remains to be seen.

For a little background: I've been using pretty steadily for about the past month. I only ever smoke it, no IV usage or anything else. I begin to experience slight discomfort about 12 hours after my last hit and it becomes pretty noticeable about 18 hours later.
If I can answer any more questions that would make it easier to give advice, please just ask. 

Thanks so much for all of your help.",1435815568.0

Maybe because I feel bad about most of the stuff I did or maybe because I have the same anger I had back then but I really need to get this off my chest. When I was in highschool 10th grade I was full of anger for the world and lets say I hung out with a not so great group of kids. They would give me a couple a week pills for free or sell me about 10 for $10 but he only did that once a month. Well as any junkie goes they get addicted. They decided to stop selling to me and stop giving me any what so ever. Turns out they got their pills from their grandparents medicine cabinet so a couple weeks later I hung out with the supplier and stayed the night. All I ended up doing was raiding the medicine cabinet and waited a couple hours till I called my sister to pick me saying I was feeling sick. I really wanted to leave because I just stole half the pills out of several bottles pain pills anxiety pills and muscle relaxers. He found out and stoped talking to me. I truly didnt care but then I started to run low on my supply so I started visiting my grandparents way more than usual they only lived a few hours away Their house was a junkies dream. Really strong Oxycontin was all I cared about though and I was smart I would just take 7 a week when they were going to bed or went out to pick up some stuff. One day I got greedy and got in the cabinet when I thought they were gone but turns out my grand maw was home feeling sick. I thought id be able to quickly get a few extra pills this time around well I got caught (who knows maybe they suspected it the whole time and wanted to catch me) once I closed the cabinet she walks right by the bathroom and acted all suspicious like. After that they started hanging around the bathroom when I was going there and wouldn't go out while o was there. Luckily I had another junkie friend and he sold me a huge bag of pills at school but with my luck they caught him with pills and I was afraid of getting ratted out so I had to flush them. Turns out he did rat me out but he said I sold him what he had. I let them search me, my locker, and stuff no money or drugs so they me go but I was out $500 that I originally had saved for college. After that no one trusted me so I started to go around the neighborhood picking locks and taking a few pills from house. There rumors going around that I was a rat and lots of people started to hear about me raiding my friend's grandparents medicine cabinet. After the teachers started to hear the rumors they got in contact with my parents.  Well here comes a good ole surprise drug test. I failed and got sent to rehab but that only taught me how to be prepared for a surprise drug test and got me hookups in the community.  Luckily by the time I graduated highschool I stopped touching pills but I am still seen as a junkie to my family and ex highschool friends. Nowadays Im laid off from my job and am starting to think about that dark time nonstop. I don't care if you think this is fake or not I just need to get story out there so one else doesn't have to start thinking about the guilt they will get from this dark path.",1435922438.0

Do you remember someone bragging about snagging an incredibly sweet piece of sub-reddit real estate?


It's not really a very interesting mystery to anyone else but me and its not even really that interesting to me.  It's just that ever since I had the thought to make a spare/back up opiate sub-reddit I became aware of ""r/0piates"" and iv been trying to figure out who owns that sub reddit ever since but no one ever comes forward.  

The longer the 'mystery' goes on the more I want an explanation!  Below are the results of a brainstorming session of possible situations and and scenarios concerning the ownership/ backstory of  ####*The SuPeR sP00kY sT0rY 0f R/0pIaTeS (VERSION ZERO)*
 

###is it a haunted sub-reddit that is only for sub-reddit members who have passed away so that they can still reddit in heaven or hell or nirvana or thug mansion???

####Is it because they didn't see my single prior post asking who owns it?

###IS IT SOMETHING MORE INSIDIOUS AND/OR TREACHEROUS THAN THAT??? 

####Is it actually controlled by a troll or hater who is just waiting for ""r/opiates"" to get shut down by *""them""* only to wait for everyone to move over to ""r/0piates"" and then they block access to the sub??? 

###*was the person who had this idea someone whose tenure on R/OPIATES was short but sweet and they just completely forgot (I know it's hard to believe that an opiate addict would have periods of ""lost time"") they even registered this this sweet piece of Sub-Reddit Real Estate???*.  

####*did one of the reddit admins create the sub-reddit in hopes of forcing us to come up with a more creative sub-reddit name so that normal people who find R/OPIATES sooo offensive (or the flame/scam war with r/loans gets reignited) that they were able to get us shutdown and knowing that the next obvious name for a new sub-reddit would be r/0piates so because its already taken we are forced to come up with a more creative sub-reddit name which makes it 10x harder for the easily offended normies can't find and persecute us?*   

###*is it a figurative insulting name for a new religion???  

####*is it a club for everyone in the world EXCEPT people with the last name  ""Piates"" AKA 0 Piates???* 

###*Does it stand for ""0 Penises In Assholes Tonight Except in Spirit""???*  

####was it the result of a fight between the original creator of R/OPIATES and that person's  ""best Internet friend"" over who got to be head MOD of R/OPIATES so  the 2nd in command *stormed off* digitally and ""started its OWN awesome NEW subreddit"" in order ""too see just who has more internet best friends"" ???  

###Is it the result of someone having the all too common idea ""why can't we just openly source?"" Or ""there are TOO MANY RULES on this forum!  I'm going to start my own version where there are no rules whatsoever!""  And it was just barely busy for about a week before everyone just went back to the main sub (IE ""thisplaceis dope"" OR ""anarchyECP"" AND THEN ""Youho1ding"" AND THEN ""OurOverUsedVeins"" AND THEN  ""glassine"" AND THEN ""heroin"" AND THEN ""skag"" AND THEN ""NotHolding"" AND THEN ""NJMEETUPS"" AND THEN ""OpiateChat"" ).  

####is it a sub created to shitty math jokes? Hint: 0+PI=ATEs....get it? Like 0 (zero)+PI (3.1415926)= ATE....get it? Like the ZERO is an open mouth and the PI is a PIE and it equals ""ATEs""......get it? 

###is it being held onto by someone who finds popular sub-reddits and websites and lays claim to the most obvious misspelling/mis-type of the sub-reddit's name  in order to capitalize on the traffic  created by people spelling the address wrong??? 

####is it a subreddit created by A single Artifical Intelligence who happens to be addicted to ""iDoser.""  Specifically the ""Heroin"" and  ""Iboga"" digital doses???   

###is it a poorly thought out and oddly specific opiate sub-reddit where everyone has to speak in 1337 SpEaK or at the very least the letter 'o' is completely banned???  

####is it a government plot to convince kids that opiates are ""kewl"", hence spelling it with a Zero instead of the letter O, in order to get them addicted to hard drugs (specifically opiates)  so that they are unable to mobilize the youth vote for Bernie Sanders and the political system can continue being bought and sold by the highest bidder???  

###was it an ambitious scheme by a group of shadow r/opiates ""power users""  in an effort to convince a really annoying user that 'r/0piates' was actually  'r/opiates' so that that annoying user would leave the rest of us alone and just post all of their nonsense  in the Zero version and not ever wonder why they were the only person posting  in the  Zero version of   'R/opiates'??? 

####is it a special sub-reddit that you eventually ""unlock"" and are able to view the posts after you have spent a single year posting regularly on r/opiates without ever getting a single down vote???  

###was it a prop used by the police in a sting operation because their undercover agent couldn't get a single upvote on any of his comments or submitted content (in order to get his 'street cred' up)  because all of the members of R/OPIATES have such good cop radar that everyone knew he was a cop from the way his comments smelled in the air after they read them out loud???  

####did I register  r/0piates while in a complete black out, due to opiates and benzos,  and I'm unable to remember the password or even doing it at all???

###did YOU register the name while in a blackout that is preventing you from remembering the password or even doing it in the first place?

All ashes fell from the end of my cigarette onto the ground and grew right out of the soil. Chandelier leaves stretched all over the world in a vehicular sound for 600 miles. Someone punched a hole in the back of the sky, so now I spray the dance floor at the end of the night. I can see the sun seeping through a crack in the floor cause the moon is rushing up to drop her hits in my eyes.

Our land keeps screaming out cause no one's watching the way the ocean keeps on violently ripping tiny pieces away. I watched a man with a gun direct his hands to the sun, and within a single second, knew how the story had gone. 

He said ""I just shot up and now I'm sliding back down, so keep a finger on the pulse and your ear to the ground."" The wind screaming, hard rain pounding in its place. The needle cued up, she touched her lips to my veins. I watched his eyes roll upwards, backwards avalanche until the function of his lungs could breathe new life in again.

They have the A 215 imprint but are the size and shape of a M Box 30. A's are baby blue and one of the smaller 30s, with a thin edge and rounded faces. My friend's were fatter like the M Box 30s and it was very pale blue/almost white and a tad speckled but not as speckled as an M is Box up close. 

They also have a distinctively different font, the A on an Actavis A 215 has two straight perpendicular sides while my friends sample has slanted sides as so ( /\ ). The 2 is also not straight at the ends as on a normal A, but its ends are curled. 

Effects apparently were very similar and def opiate but hes working with a tolerance. He smoked some and said it had the distinct nice marshmallowy taste that MBox's have.


Finally they were very nicely made. Not like other fakes that have popped up. It broke up nice, not flaky or crumbling.  

The connect said they are the new A215's, has anyone heard of this?
I do not know what to make of this. Why make such a good fake if your gonna use the wrong imprint. These would have been flawless fake M's. Also why make a pill die if your not even gonna use the right font. So much confusion. Any one care to discuss??",1435884163.0

...And as a side question, while I've got the ears of the pros: saline solution... I've heard that it's better to mix shots with this than just plain ol' boiled water. I've also heard that sinus rinse satchels (like for Neti Pots) could be good for mixing up that solution because they're completely sterile, pH balanced, etc. I have a pack of NeilMed satchels lying around which are 99% high-grade sodium chloride *and sodium bicarbonate*.

I've been clean for about 9 months now and one of the main struggles I've been having is failing to see how I've improved my life since being clean. As far as I was concerned, I lived the life of a junkie except for doing heroin. 

I bought an old 1980's Mercedes the other day. I never could have afforded it 9 months ago. As I was cruising down the street today, staring at the Mercedes badge on the front of the car, enjoying the view, loving the new ride, I said to myself, ""This is what happens when you stop doing heroin,"" almost in a laughing manner. But, it was true. 

I don't normally like to post shit in this subreddit talking about being clean but I felt like maybe this could be useful motivation for somebody else on here who's trying to figure out the point of even trying to stop doing dope.

It DOES pay off. 9 months ago I didn't have a penny to my name and now I can afford to drive a car that cost $100,000 25 years ago. So no, your life isn't guaranteed to turn around and become fucking amazing the second you stop doing heroin, but you will be able to buy cool shit for yourself, and not have to worry anymore whether or not you can afford to buy cigarettes or how you're going to get by every day. 

It may not feel as good as a fat bag of dope but this is pretty fucking nice. I get to sleep in tomorrow and not wake up sick. I don't owe anybody any money. My family doesn't call me crying every day. I don't have to communicate with retarded dope boys on the phone anymore. I don't have to be around insane crackheads asking me for cigarettes anymore. I can drive down the street and go as fast as I want, knowing that if I get pulled over, all I'll get is a speeding ticket and not arrested for possession. People trust me now. I trust people now. I'm not mad at anybody. Nobody's mad at me.

First post under this username, trying to keep work and play separated.

I'm the director/producer of a tiny documentary film crew that is visiting the Chillicothe/Portsmouth/Piketon OH area in the coming months. Possibly Huntington WV and Eastern KY in later visits.

We're working on a series of documentary shorts about the days of the prescription opiate epidemic the Ohio River Valley. We've made contact with lots of public health officials and rehabilitation centers, but we're looking to augment this with real stories.

I'm making this film with my best friend, a longtime camera operator in TV/film, who grew up in the Knoxville area. He lost his brother to an overdose, and his dad served a related 26-month prison term. This is a topic that's very dear to us.

If you know somebody (or are somebody) with first-hand account of the pill mills and doctors (Portsmouth in particular), we would love to talk to you.

Furthermore, if you have any information that would aid in our research, that would be a huge help.

PM me to get in touch. I'll follow up with a phone number -- I want anyone who might contact me to feel 100% assured that we aren't producing some shitty reality show or some similar garbage. We're just trying to create a thoughtful consideration of Purdue Pharma's lasting impacts in the Rust Belt.

This goes without saying, but any participation on your behalf would be kept anonymous if you so choose. We aren't here to put anybody on blast. We just want to tell a story that, I think, is way under-told.

Thanks in advance.

All the best,

I find that for myself, the first and second phases are reversed. First thing to come on is a weird mild feeling of my body rapidly switching from cold to hot in different areas then the restlessness and aches in my arms and legs. These continue for around 4 days then subside to a manageable point. However, I don't have any nausea or vomiting whatsoever and the diarrhea doesn't come until the third day at the earliest. Similarly, I find that by the fourth day I'm typically almost back to normal (still feeling shitty but functional and normal). However, most guides as well as most other users say it's at least 6 days until they feel better and that the third and fourth days are some of the worst.

I snort Opanas, which have a terribly short half-life requiring redosing every 4 to 6 hours to avoid withdrawals, so maybe the rapid onset of the withdrawals and general makeup of the drug and my own body are different from the norm? Granted, I've noticed my issues of chills, hot/cold flashes, and restlessness tend to be far more severe than my friends during withdrawal while stomach issues are far milder for me.

I have been in bed most of the evening and now stare out the window.  My daughter will close the curtain after I fall asleep because she says I waste the heater.  I hate that damn heater.  It dries my skin and reminds me where I live.  When the curtains open at least my spirit is exposed to the starlight.  Though they move, bloom and die these are the same stars that I looked at when I was young.  We are nothing to the stars.  A soft sigh on the wind.  I can see the two stars now in Ursa Major.  Mizar and Alcor.  Binary stars.  The Lovers.

I hear the child's bare feet slapping over the hardwood floors.  She never walks anywhere.  Always running.  I hear her rapidly approaching and then an abrupt silence.  I look at the door and see her peeking in.

""I see you little one.""

""Hi grandpa.  Can I come in?  Mom says you're resting but you're awake and I saw you so I stopped by and-""

""Yes.  Come in.""

""You're not grumpy right?  Did you take your medicine?  You're happy after you take your medicine right?""

I look at my granddaughter.  So perceptive and so very wise.  The innocence of an 8 year old is truly a magical thing.

""I'm ALWAYS happy to see you little one.  Give me a hug.""

And she smiles as bright as the noon day sun and throws her bony arms around my dried husk.  She sits on the bed and looks at me seriously with her wide blue eyes.

""Can I get a story?  Not a sad story.  You tell too many sad stories grandpa.""

""Ok.  This is a love story.""

""Is it happy?""

""Well kid, we need a little sadness to understand happiness.  Now be quiet and let me think...""

Once there was a boy who loved a girl.  And she loved him back. Fiercely.  To the boy there was nothing but the girl.  It was all he ever wanted.  So they loved.  They were happy.

The love they shared was like a fire to the forest, like time feeding on the world when everything was new and beautiful.  They were destroying each other.  But they were young.  And young people enjoy standing next to the flame.

To enhance their love, the boy and the girl discovered a magic potion.  In this age you could buy magic potions anywhere.  Though it hurt them terribly, they took the magic potion every day because it made their world shine brighter.  You see they loved the light.  Like moths to a flame.  For as I said, they had all the time in the world to burn brighter and brighter.  

Death was there too.  Death was everywhere even in this new part of the world.  The boy and the girl were growing closer to each other and closer the End.  Such is the way of all things.  Death watched with eyes that had seen it all.  Death knew how every story ends...yet these two were up to something.

Death watched the pair grow sloppy.  Sometimes the boy would crush the dead moths that fell from the spider's lair into the magic potions they used.  It would not be long now, thought Death.  Though the boy and girl could not see the flames around them, their world was burning away.

One night Death crept in.  There was no more boy and no more girl. Their stories and their lives ended.  Their world disappeared and the smoke traveled far out to sea where it joined with rain clouds and wept.

But the boy had not been idle when he went out.  He would tell stories to anyone who would listen.  His thoughts rose high on the wind and was shrieked loudly from gulls.  The minnows in the stream took the story to the sea where it spread far and wide through the smiles of dolphins and the songs of sharks.  Soon every animal knew of the love between a boy and a girl.  In the forest a madman heard the whispers of foxes and the tales from the birds.  And this man could write in the languages of man and machine.

Soon others heard the tales.  They took them the way people do and twisted them to their own words, hearts and deeds.  Only the boy, the girl and the love remained.  The language of the creatures joined the languages of man and soon the languages of machine all knew the story of the boy and the girl.

Death would come by and see the boy and the girl again.  This was something new.  They were still alive in the minds of the forest creatures, birds and the sea.  Still burning in love.  The machines told the story to the stars.  The stars told the story to us.  And we can still see them. See over there?  Those two stars in the bear constellation?  The boy and the girl. Still hand in hand and still burning in the night sky.

Skeptical, the girl looks out the telescope I have on my desk.  My eyes are trained to see the two stars but I wanted to share something with the child so I set it up after dinner.  Kid watches too much TV.  Needs a little more science.

""Oooh!  I see it grandpa!  I see the two stars!"", then she looks at me.  ""But they are not holding hands!""

""Sure they are.  You see the stars, you know their story so close your eyes and picture the rest.""

I watch her face as she looks in her mind for the boy and girl.  I feel lucky to be near a soul young enough to still see unseen things. Her mom calls.  Bath time.  It is a school night and she sprints away leaving me to my quiet thoughts.  

""Khina!"" I call.   I know I am intruding in their goodnight ritual but maybe...

""What?"" she calls back annoyed.

""My medicine?"" I ask trying not to sound as desperate as I feel inside.  

""Nice try old man.  You know you got at least an hour.  Try not to think about it!""

Fucking kids.  I look at the clock.  Sigh.  One hour seventeen minutes until my pill.  That brat will hold my dose to the very last second.

My daughter is in charge of my medicine.  I used to have the luxury of pretending to be forgetful.  I could slip in an extra pill.  But I don't fool her anymore.  That one was always too damn clever. My last pill of the night is always bittersweet.  After it passes through my being the pain will come with many hours until dawn.  The great loneliness will swallow me up like the distances between stars.

 All this seeking made me realize something. I'm in love with dope.

So I wait a bit like 30 min for it to kick in and then settle down a bit so I'm not totally wasting the boy even though it's not really wasting anything cause its fun as hell. But I do all the boy and you know at this point I'm real good and I'm all good. Then you know have a couple beers and I just finished the rest of my hard that's why I'm asking the question. So I guess now to the question Let's just say I want to speedball I've never actually shot a speedball so I don't know all the facts done it before just never shot it. What is the easiest way to go about it. Do I use like two cookers and have one full of the hard and vinegar and one full of water and the boy? Or do I just put both the boy and hard in vinegar and dissolve the both of them At the same time and shot that. I guess hat I'm asking is the vinegar going to do anything weird to the boy or is it fine just throwing both of them in there. Unless there is some way easier than then both of those I just don't know. Or is the easiest way the way i did it. So r/opiates talk to me and help me out how can I make this easier.

I joked around with the grill guy saying "" why didn't she just use the private bathroom?"" ""then she wouldn't have got caught."" Not too relevant but the owners aren't potheads anymore, and are actually extremely straight edge. So I continue doing my thing in the private bathroom and everything is cool. Well i've been trying to get off opiates for years, like 100 times i've tried to get clean. I had actually made it 4 days and was feeling A LOT better. I used gaba, subs, and xanax, for the tramper and it went great. Well day 4 comes around, i'm kind of get tired earlier than I should from the w/d, and was told I could score some dilaudid. I couldn't pass it up so i had them delivered to my work, like i'd done 1000 times, no problems there.

So i'm like damn that kicked my ass, better get back to work. Well I must have looked fucked up, and I think I was nodding, because the boss asked if I was feeling ok. I told him ""yeah, just a little tired"". Didn't work, a minute later he sends me home.

Another way you could avoid WDs is by getting really drunk or knocking yourself out with benzos, why don't you ever hear about people doing that?

Basically I was hit by a car while walking, got broken in half, and was left for dead. I've got a 15 inch rod keeping my left femur together and a plate in my neck that had to go in to stop the swelling in my spinal cord so I didn't end up a paraplegic. Not the most pleasant experience of my life, but shit happens and I'm just trying to move on. Now, my state has recently enacted new laws about prescription narcotics, and as I've found out through dealing with this, there is pressure coming from oversight committes or whatever on the doctors and surgeons themselves to not be writing prescriptions for opiates. It's been a constant battle to even get prescriptions of Norco 10s written and filled for me. It's a bunch of bullshit and I doubt that any of these people who have been giving me this much static about it would feel the same if this had happened to them. I was supposed to be refered to by pain management by a clinic I was going to but they never did and it fucked me over, I ended up getting red flagged for having too many different doctors write me scripts (because none of them want to actually deal with the issue so they all just wrote like seven day scripts for norcos and made it the next doctors problem). I finally found my own pain management specialist and have an appointment set up for next week.

In full disclosure I've had drug problems in the past. I've been busted for possession and shoplifting because I was stealing to get my fix and I've been to jail a couple times.  But this isn't the life I'm living anymore. I could go find heroin again, I know who to talk to still and with what has happened to me I don't think many people would really blame me, but I'm not trying to do all that. I'm not trying to get all strung out again or deal with a bunch of junkie bullshit  (I'm sure a lot of you know exactly what I'm talking about). I wouldn't even be taking these fucking norcos if it weren't for almost getting killed. I had been sober for months, I had a full time job, I was looking at an apartment. I was doing what the fuck I was supposed to be doing for basically the first time in my adult life. I don't want to go back to the way I wasnliving, but I need to get through the next couple of months. Without meds I basically have to lay in one spot. I'm not trying to do that. I'd like to go back to work, I'd like to be living on my own again. I just need to get through the next couple of months while my leg regains mobility.

I just want this motherfucker to write me a script for like two oxy 40s a day. That doesn't seem like so much to ask given the situation. I'm not trying to take them forever either, they can take me off them in a couple months when I have full mobility in my leg and can do basic shit like put on pants without being in a bunch of pain. But with all the trouble I've had so far with just the norcs I don't even know how to broach this topic without just being assumed to be a junkie looking for pills.  I think a lot of it is going to hinge on what kind of person this doctor is, some have looser prescription pads than others. But fucking a, you can just take a five second look at me and tell I need shit. I'm still using a walker and wearing a neckbrace and am all scarred up. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What the fuck should I tell this doctor to make him go on this? I've never been to pain managment, I really only have second hand knowledge of how these people operate. I just need to get through the next couple months. Any suggestions would be welcome.",1435947216.0

Where do I even start? So we stayed up all night again after smoking a bunch of meth either last night or two days ago, who knows anyway? This morning is Jul 4th and apparently old creepers get horny as fuck when they see stars and stripes and smell sulfur on the breeze.  
 

I am trolling CL and adam4adam trying to get a bite on our collective line, and suddenly remember one of my old tricks from a couple weeks ago asked me to PM him if I found a friend with a thicker dick than me. Lo and behold, my boyfriend's little teapot is short and stout, so I PM the crazy old fucker and he decides he does indeed want to come over and suck us both off. Ambitious old coot, considering the last time he blew me he had to take three breaks to tell me about his last heart attack, his diabeetus, and his grandson's 5th grade graduation ceremony. I'll spare you most of the details but after about 45 minutes of not maintaining boners and oldman walrus grinding his fupacock against my shin while trying to wake up my uncooperative weiner, HK and I finally manage to jack ourselves off furiously enough to where we half-heartedly jizz on our own bellybuttons.  
 

Now, this old son of a bitch has already jewed us down on our usual rates to about half of what we command but to be honest, the residual meth isn't allowing for a good show anyway, and we just want to get well ASAP. He grudgingly gives us what amounts to our pocket money since he's apparently operating on 1960s rates, and leaves. Ten minutes later I get a message saying he felt cheated even though we shot our loads. All my whatthefucks. I tell him I felt cheated because he basically cheated us by making us drop the rates so low. Some back and forth occurs and eventually he says that HKs dick was not as fat as advertised. Well, golly gee, sir, after a 48 hour meth binge and 45 minutes of suffering through that sorry excuse for a blowjob that you perpetrated on us, I'm sorry we weren't exactly as plump as a Ball Park Frank. But fuck you anyhow. And besides, how do you make it through 70 years of life sucking dicks on the DL and still not know how to suck a dick properly? You are a penis possessor if I know my genitalia--that should at least count for something.  
  


Whatever, got dope. Feeling a little better, I get an adam4adam message from this creepy guy from way out in the wilds of Randolph county. He just happens to be in Greensboro and wants to come over RIGHT NOW and suck my dick as he's been threatening to do for the last two weeks or so. Finally. I tell him 40, he asks if 35 is okay and I tell him no, 40 or nothing.  


So he's already trying to make power plays before he even talks to me on the phone. The johns do this shit. They try for a special pic, or to get some piddling little amount off their total, or something else like that just to see if they can MAKE you do something. In this business the more inexperienced johns tend to be very passive aggressive, and they're also terrified of you. Which is good. You want them afraid because these fucking closet cases with the pushbroom mustaches and XXXL polo shirts try to come over on you any way they can (aside from the obvious innuendo).  


 Which leads us to our next client. He seems really paranoid about anyone else being home, so I stash my boyfriend in the spare room like a hatrack with a smart phone and wait for this fucker to show up. He comes in, we shake hands, all is well. I lead him to my bedroom and make a little small talk with him, trying to set him at ease. Well, he is not at ease. In fact, I start to think he must be a cop because I'm laying on the bed, jerking off seductively and giving him my best boy next door looks and he won't even make eye contact or sit any closer than 2 feet. I'm starting to think about potentially worrying when up he springs and says ""No, I just don't think I can do this,"" and makes a fucking beeline for the door. I manage to reach past him and slam the door shut. This guy probably has a good 7 inches on me as far as height (lord knows it wasn't length) so he tries to intimidate me, which I wasn't having. He has wasted enough of my goddamn time over the last 2 weeks with back and forth emailing and stupid questions and ""scheduling conflicts"" meaning he has to sneak away from his wife, and I'm over it. I demand to be paid what we agreed on. He basically tells me to fuck off in Southern and halfheartedly shoves me out of the way and out the door. I slam the door shut again, my cock flapping in the morning breeze and yell for HK, who eventually manages to get it through his beautiful head that something has gone awry. Leaving HK to snatch this grown ass man up, I manage to pull on my undershorts (dude seems to have thought I wouldn't have walked out the house cock-to-the-breeze, but I would have) and follow them outside.   


HK is heading him off at the pass, and I manage to make it around to the guys drivers' side door. I demand compensation for my time and for my trouble and he tries to protest saying that I didn't do anything with him so I shouldn't get anything. *Motherfucker, you're the closeted piece of shit fag that wouldn't suck a healthy young cock right in front of your face*, notmyfuckingproblem.jpg. I'm leaning against his door and giving him the stinkeye and he decides to take a walk down the fucking neighborhood street. Well, I can't be having this shit. I corral him back towards his piece of shit sedan and demand the 20 he offered me the first time in compensation for him being a total fucking cunt. Snatch the bill out of his hands, he tries to give me a resentful look like I cheated him or some shit, fuck that. I've invested FAR more than 20 dollars worth of time and mental anguish in getting this fat piece of shit over to my house so he can not suck my dick and run away like a little bitch. I'm a bit shaken up so we walk up to the corner to buy smokes and meet up with a former john who has become one of our good friends who needed help purchasing a meth pipe since he thought of himself as too respectable, but apparently we're just disreputable enough to buy meth pipes but not so disreputable that he's ashamed to be seen with us in public. Hah. That goes off without a hitch, so we go back to the lair to cuddle and listen to music.  


3hoursbliss.avi  


6pm client stands us up, no big deal, got another guy coming at 8pm.  


8pm guy. Holy shit. I don't even know where to start. Guy has CP (cerebral palsy, not cheese pizza) or possibly a recent stroke, we aren't sure, but that's immaterial. He comes in with a bag of toys he wants to try invading our anuses with, but isn't too pushy about it and we don't press the issue either, especially because he seemed a little TOO excited about his 10 inch strapon that he wanted to abuse someone's hole with.  


Fast forward about 30 seconds to the bedroom. We're laying on the bed naked. He of course has a tiny dick. They all have tiny dicks, except when they DON'T and it's a 9 inch long broken off baseball bat that wants to go in ME. But I digress. So we start off with light touches, and I see HK go in for a kiss with Joel, we'll call him. Great, that means I'm on dick duty. So I'm furiously trying to massage some sort of blood flow into this man's peterino with the best my tongue and throat can offer, thinking ""man, I use this mouth to speak like 7 languages and sing like an angel but lately the things I've done in the name of customer service would make a frenchman blush"", and I shoot a side-eye over to poor HK where it looks like this guy has transformed into an extra from Attack On Titan and is trying to eat HKs face and lick up the remains at the same time. I'm trying hard not to laugh as I watch HK try hard not to vomit in this guys face, so I turn my nose back to the sub-fupa and suck this soft dick like a good little boy whore that they all seem to want me to be.  


This guy. This motherfucking guy. He drools more than a basset hound on first generation antipsychotic medication. He is made of lip, tongue, and mucilaginous slimespit that he leaves everywhere. Everything he touches is graced with a snail-trail of this strangely scented (denture glue?) spit that he seems intent on depositing alternately into my ear, my mouth, HKs ear, HKs mouth. From hereon out things get a bit hazy so I'm just going to describe what I haven't blocked out. He's fucking delighted with us, that's for damn sure. But the spit. And he sucks dick like he's eating dick. Like actually eating a dick. Chowing down on a cocksicle. Most non erotic blowjob both HK and I have ever had the misfortune of having in our entire lives. But the guy is so goddamn oblivious he doesn't seem to notice that neither one of our cocks even wake up to check and see if the sun's up yet--might as well be in an ice bath for all the activity we've got going on below the equator. Just keeps chowing, sucking, chowing, sliming, spitting, what the actual fuck, I've had showers drier than this. I think I have swimmer's ear at this point. I'm making horrible faces the whole time but thankfully he can't see.  


Oh, and the rimming. Imagine the scariest progeric baby in the world playing peekaboo behind your nutsack and cock and that's what you've got. Like the rising of the wretched sun the day after Armageddon, this face will be burnt into my soul until the actual End of Days itself, while the selfsame lips and tongue devour my asshole like the Fenris wolf eating the spheres of heaven and with a similar voraciousness. A wet slimy sponge bath by a Lovecraftian horror rising over the hills of my once innocent ass-cheeks, which, incidentally, are thrown up over my shoulders in a position that I'm sure is not good for my arthritis at all. Then there was the fingering, accompanied by such a face as to imply that this, THIS, was the fingering to end all fingerings, the Fingering, if you will. Ne'er again will I be satisfied by normal hands, nay, I should be in esctasy, rising up like an explosion of larksong in rose scented morning dew. Alas, all I feel is an overwhelming urge to poo and check the clock.  


Also, I come to a revelation as to why he has not seemed to notice that our dicks are not hard. His dick never got hard, not the entire time. We all right ourselves so feet again are where feet belong and heads are where heads go in a normal person's world, and some sort of witty repartee takes place---wait, no, he just puts me and HK into a headlock and alternates funneling spit into our mouths with his massive, slimy tongue, like a cow with thrush. Although finally, FINALLY, he lays back, stops tossing us around like ninepins and decides one of us is going to continue to kiss him while the other sucks his cock to completion. I immediately head due south. Fuck that, I'd suck a million cocks before I'd tolerate one more kiss from this ectoplasmic, miasmic horror of a mouth unseen in the lands of Light since the days of Dagon and Yog-Sothoth. So suck I do, and finally he says ""baby, I'm gonna cum"". The seventh trumpet has sounded, the seventh seal is broken, the Heavens are open and Christ has come again thank FUCK he's almost done. I back off of his cock and jerk furiously (another victim of Death-Grip syndrome, he apparently jerks his cock so hard that you need equivalent pressure found in the formation of diamonds from small lumps of black dinosaur leavings) until he cums all over his chest. O, happy day! Caloo, callay! fuck this shit and give me money. Nope, he wants to lay back and talk for a minute or two. Fine, as long as there's no mouth contact. HK and I cannot look each other in the face for fear of laughing, crying, or perhaps a suicide pact enacted immediately without discussion. He leaves after giving us the agreed upon amount (NOT WORTH IT) and we collapse on the sofa. Just as the shit talking settles in and we're laughing, there's a knock. FUCK, he's back! But, false alarm, apparently he just forgot his bag of toys.  


Immediately we have my man drop off a half gram. Thousand yard stare etched into our faces, we smoke cigarettes and laugh because that's all you can do at this point.  


The rest of the day amounts to dope, dinner, fireworks...before I left for the fireworks, however, I reposted our ads after our 8pm cataclysm (and I use that word in the sense of the original Greek roots--a great downward splashing) and waited for the hellish fish from depths chthonic and inchoate again to venture forth towards the light of late summer evening, fading and running off into darkened corners like hellspawned fireflies dancing infernal sarabandes over the glutted corpse of the over-60s dating scene in the rotted gay underbelly, fish-white and redolent of cadaverine and bradford pear trees, of our third-tier southern town.  


A certain gentleman (you can tell because he will be the first to let you know) responded to my ad shortly after having reposted it.  



*To understand the dynamic here, I have to explain the ad that HK and I have been spamming the South with for the last fortnight. It lists me as ""mo$tly $traight/versatile"" (note the very $ubtle dollar signs) and him as mostly gay. In gay personal ad language ""mostly straight"" is usually understood to mean bi, which is usually understood to mean queer as a football bat. Whatever, you're selling the sizzle before they can even smell the meat. Goes on to list the obligatory promises of drug-free, diseaseless, attractive boyflesh for the taking. I exaggerate my age by -11 years, HKs by -7. No one wants a thirty-something year old twink prostitute. Even 25 is pushing it.*  


The Gentleman's first email consisted simply of the request: ""Would love to know more about the young gay brother!"" (Oh: that's the other thing. HK and I are selling ourselves as half brothers who fuck. Goddamn pervs eat it up. Only one guy has even questioned it, but that's because he seems to have less of a capacity for self-delusion than the other skeevemonsters that inhabit the less-savory, seldom swept catacombs of craigslist. Apparently incest is the new girl-on-girl of the porn world. I don't look at porn and never really have so I wouldn't have known. I just know what sells. It's a taboo that's relatively harmless-no genetic consequences, so why not fuck a same-sex sibling. And we made it half-brothers so it's more believable because we could not look less alike. I don't think we share a single genetic trait aside from our general ratio of torso length to leg length.) I immediately assume my stance of pervy elder (by three fictional years) brother and start to pimp out my boyfriend. ""He's slender and smooth, with brown hair and blue eyes,"" along with a few empirical measurements for good...measure. I ask if he has any more questions.  


The Gentleman queries, ""Is he cute? Does he have tattoos, piercings, facial hair?"" I see where this is going. This guy either likes a bad boy or wants to defile the innocent. I imagine it's the latter. Chuckling as I imagine HK as an innocent, I respond in the negative, mentioning that I do have a few tattoos on my arms, back and shoulders, just in case he is into the sensitive, damaged bad boy kind of thing. I assure him that my brofriend is cute, and to drive the illusion home I send three pics of me looking as edgy as my still-teenaged face will allow, making sure to show off my facial scars, and two pics of HK--one of which is an anonymous shot of the elegant, marble like curves of his shoulderblades, spine, and the perfection of form that is his ass, and another of him looking particularly boyish in a striped polo shirt and an earnest expression. The tedious, line-by-line conversation progresses with the Gentleman praising HKs ""cute butt"" and myself agreeing. The Gentleman praises both our bodies but is obviously far more interested in HK. (Looking through my emails, I have discovered that the Gentleman ran me around for an entire day trying to see if I might suck his dick a few days before HK came down. I agreed, but expressed apprehension at getting naked, still playing the reluctant straight boy, which has worked in my favor in the past, but as you will see, the Gentleman has Opinions about that. Eventually he told me he was uninterested and ""had things to take care of"" due to my unwillingness to undress and worship at his altar of decrepitude. Let me also add that the first question the Gentleman wanted to know about me was whether I was white, the implication being that I was some dirty lower race trying to pass myself off as one of the lower echelons of Caucasian beauty.)   


Despite his interest, the Gentleman is still unable to bring himself to ask if he might set up a meeting with the holy, unspoiled strip of boy-flesh that is my boyfriend, so I prompt him by asking if he'd like to hang out with one or both of us. He responds by asking if HK would care for a massage, and swiftly follows that by asking how much it might set him back. I quote him the absurdly low rate of 60 since HK would ""just be getting a massage, right?"" and stating that we normally ask 80 for an hour of his time but since it's simply an innocent massage...  


Well, apparently even for such an upstanding, shining example of flesh-buyer as the Gentleman, somehow sixty dollars for an hour of a human being's time and the use of their body is a ridiculous sum. ""Dang, y'all are expensive,"" he protests, quickly asking if we drive. It plainly states in our ad that we do not drive and we only host, but these johns are either idiots or persistent and continue to ask things that we try to cover from the start. We still have not figured out whether they simply don't notice all the dollar signs we pepper our ads with, or whether they pretend they don't know what they mean in hopes that perhaps, just MAYBE, they will be the one man that we choose to give it up to for free.  
 

After informing the Gentleman that we do not drive and that we will host only, he makes it clear that he does not do well with 2 guys, whatever that means, and that he is a ""nice guy, older but very clean,"" as well as ""not in shape but not gross"" which most assuredly means that he is gross. I reassure him in the most gentle tones possible that he is under no obligation to hire the both of us, and that he can enjoy his time with HK solo and that I would not be involved or even nearby. He also asks the inane question ""what would I get out of this"" which almost every white knighting closet case on craigslist always wants to know, because no matter how much they want to save our lily white asses from a life of cocksucking and assfucking, all they really want to know is will they get to shove their cocks in one or another of our holes before too many other men have been there first.   


In a complete nonsequitur, the Gentleman turns his laser-sharp focus to me. ""So you're straight. What do you like to do with guys?"" Immediately I begin confabulating, saying that I only date girls (lie) but that I've done most everything with guys (truth) and that I enjoy it (partial truth) and throw in the fact that I have been told on numerous occasions, most recently by my boyfriend (I don't mention that part, love you /u/heroinking), that I give the best head anyone has ever had, ever. I state that I *could* be considered bi (gay gay gay gay GAY, long live the king).  


Having passed his half-assed test, the Gentleman tells me I've done well and asks what the oldest guy I've ever been with is, and whether HK is comfortable with being the grapefruit at a lemon party. Again, I gently reassure him that we have nothing against older guys and that while we have not exactly been checking IDs, we've probably gotten down on some cock that existed during the Great Depression and had no serious troubles with it aside from the purely logistic (I don't tell him that much even).   


The Gentleman responds thusly: ""let me think, I have had bad experiences with young guys lately saying they were good and not...  and not sure I would be comfortable with two guys.... but your brother has such a cute body and I assume you do also...   and you are asking more than I am used to...""  


Sigh. Now what? Do I undercut my own brother and offer him up for the equivalent price of a steak dinner and a craft beer? Not yet. I respond so:  




>""Well, neither one of us are the type to judge anyone or to be critical. I really hope you do decide to visit at least one of us, as it would be helping us out greatly as well. And like I said, there's no pressure to request both of us if you're not comfortable with that-we're perfectly fine hanging out together or separately. As a matter of fact, I could even go for a walk or something if you'd rather me not be in the house haha. I don't think that our asking rate is too high for an hour of someone's time and of course if you did request both of us we give a slightly discounted rate (100 for both of us as opposed to 60 each), but like I said, it's not necessary to hire us both.  

>We consider what we do for people to be a valuable service and rather than ask next to nothing and see a lot of people we'd rather ask a small bit more and provide quality attention and companionship in return. We are certainly worth it, and you would not be disappointed at all. :) Hope to see you, and please let me know either way.""  


The discount obviously is bullshit, as is the entire paragraph, the entire point of which is to try and drive home the point to this obviously deluded and possibly retarded man that he DOESN'T HAVE TO HIRE BOTH OF US AT ONCE.  


After some small amount of time, I receive an email, the tone of which is deferential while being slightly aggressive, and accusatory in that we obviously are trying to overcharge him in his attempted purchase of a human life for an hour or so. After a quick consultation with HK, my sun and stars, we determine that heroin is more important than personal pride at this point, so I respond to the Gentleman and say that my sweet, innocent younger brother is willing to lower himself to receive a massage, and no more, for a mere forty dollars, but only for the Gentleman and only this once, as our compassion has gotten the better of us and we deeply feel his need to wrap his gnarled hands around some boycock before he dies.   


""no sorry""  


Now I'm pissed. I respond to the Gentleman that anything less than that would be insulting to the both of us, and that I hope he finds what he is looking for, the implication being that he find it somewhere else and stop fucking bothering us. I fucked up my wording a bit, as what I meant to impart was that any lower offer would be insulting to the *Gentleman* as well as my brother and myself, as he is obviously an upstanding man who cannot bear to allow a young boy to sell himself at such a rate, even if it were able to make it such that he could afford it--no, he will nobly go off into the night with an unpainted chin and no faint taste of fresh mushrooms and bleach on his lips, just to preserve the dignity of America's boyhood. (Its 30 year old, heroin addict boyhood, if I may reiterate.) I am surprised to receive another email saying that he plans to enjoy the holiday by drinking some wine and watching the fireworks. Okay, great. Leave me alone. I tell him to enjoy his holiday.  



Twenty minutes later, like a bolt from the goddam blue, I get another email from the Gentleman asking if my brother lived with me. I said ""yes,"" even though I had made that clear at least five times before. At this time, I leave the house to go watch the fireworks with my ex-girlfriend who is a solid gold thread throughout the hollowed-out, bloodstained steel wire that circumscribes what I have made of my life.  
   
After a singularly amazing firework display, due mostly to the fact that we somehow managed to seat ourselves within the blast zone, thus adding extra excitement to our national holiday, I arrive home to discover that the Gentleman has continued to email my boyfriend. Here's where the true crazy begins to come out. Desperation oozes through the seams of the monitor and out from between the keys. The first question, innocently enough, tries to pinpoint the area of town we are in. HK, glory be unto Loki, does not know the town at all so is unable to answer satisfactorily. Here is his exact response:  


>hey man this is actually said brother (james) he ran out to watch the fireworks with some girl, but he1ll be back soon i hvent been here long, so im not totally familiar with the area yet. we live off spring garden, over near UNCG. and to answer your question, yes, we do live together (but if you want to just book one of us, the other will go up to the bar and have a couple beers).  


In response, the Gentleman fires off this rambling combination of passive aggression, suspicion, aspersions on my character, and misguided feelings that I'm sure he believes to be compassion and empathy:  


>not this late...   if you can ever get away during the day and be reasonable maybe we can do something...... he as offer to take care of me before for 40...   he sends out his pic freely  I have had too much wine to go out...   I think he controls you... we are close 10 mins maybe  



lolwut.gif  


Now, everyone that knows the beautiful man to whom I have given my life knows that he sort of has a resting sad-face, like a puppy dog- you know he's not really sad but if it'll get him an extra point, he'll use it. This inspires the next email from the Gentleman. At this point, these are all unsolicited and unresponded to since we had all gone to dinner together: myself, ""some girl"", and my poor, abused, controlled and human trafficked brother.  


>you have a super cute body but you face pic looks sad....  


>please do not let him use your cute body to make money for him to go out with a girl...  


>if you ever want anyone to show you around, not money and not sex, let me know....   


>but I do not want to get you in trouble with your brother  



(where in the holy name of all fuck is he getting this crap?)  


At this point I almost let my rising sentiment of ""what the fuck is this asshole on about"" overwhelm my junkie senses of an opportunity to fleece a total idiot who has already deluded himself and needs no help from me or HK, and nearly fire off this email:  

""lol dude this is C----. Are you kidding me? J---- does whatever he wants to do whenever e...""  


But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? I smell money on the wind. The Gentleman, unprompted, continues self-pityingly. You can almost hear the crumpled, ancient fedora weep as he presses it sadly to the greying hairs clinging to his elephantine neck.  


>guess you have found someone  


>if you ever want me to take you our for lunch... let me know... no sex or expectations  


(I am currently trying to figure out how we can get HK to take him up on this, preferrably immediately after he gives an erotic massage in the early afternoon. I picture something like he comes in and melodramatically weighs his heavy head in his soiled palms, weeping to the Gentleman, ""you won't believe what my brother C---- just made me do....so that he can go out...with *girls*! You can still smell the cum between my fingers! I'll never get rid of the smell!""  


And since that last proposition elicited no response in four interminable minutes, this next gem comes through the series of vacuum tubes that make up the internet.  


>will buy you lunch or whatever and give you 20 dollars just to get to know you  



The Gentleman then follows with his contact information, part of which is redacted, but the amazing, sidesplitting, pants-shittingly hilarious part remaining is an actual string of characters contained in the Gentleman's email address:  


>email me at **niceguy**XXXX@gmail.com or text me at xxx-xxx-xxxx  


this too eliciting no response (because we are still at dinner for fuck's sake), the Gentleman continues:  


>sweet dreams and have a good night  


swiftly followed by this final, oh-so-subtle attempt at manipulation wherein the Gentleman believes he is going to turn my brofriend against me, the evil controlling older brother.  


>you are not going to get anything with him controlling you  he insulted me tonight  


lolwut2.jpg  


I insulted him? LOL where? The only thing my tired, meth-addled, pyrotechnically reprogrammed brain can possibly trace an insult to is the part where I said that any less of an offer would be insulting. Or perhaps it is a blatant lie. This Gentleman is obviously so old that he doesn't understand that every email between myself and him is plainly visible to HK for his immediate perusal. Basically all I can figure is this guy has such a soft-off (old men do NOT get hard-ons, this we have learned) for HK that he has deluded himself into creating this entire scenario where I, the obviously evil *barely* white enough older brother with the rock and roll hairstyle and the tattoos is using my poor, gay little brother as a fuccboi for the masses so that I can take up with strange women and go out on the town while he stays at home sadly washing our undershorts in the sink by the dubious light of one 15 watt incandescent bulb.  


So, I, pretending now to be the younger brother, send off this masterpiece of passive aggression and manipulative rhetoric, even planting the seed of an evil stepfather just to give the Gentleman another thing to white knight about, and giving HK the choice of how to play this character---as the misguided, manipulated younger brother who loves his older brother so much that he can't even see how he is being used, or the option of painting us both as a struggling, ersatz familial unit forced to turn to prostitution just to be able to eat and afford to keep the lights on and the cats fed. Note that I, the straight brother, have also been selling myself just to keep our heads above water.  

>oh really? how did he insult you? :( and what did you mean that he sends his pic freely? we both send our pics to whoever wants to see us. but yeah sorry, my brother took me out for dinner and to see the fireworks. haha he really doesn't control me. he worked for a week on craigslist by himself to make money to get me a bus ticket to save me from our stepdad. he always takes good care of me. he usually handles all the email and negotiations because i don't like going back and forth about rates with people who try to make us go lower than we really should.

Anyway, the point is, we are having so much fucking fun. And this whole situation with the Gentleman could become a story arc of its own. We'll keep you updated, just with less verbosity. 

TLDR: ME AND HK ARE SUCKING COCKS FOR A LIVING NOW.

3c6rce,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3c6rce/im_sick_and_dont_know_why_suboxone/,3,https://redd.it/3c6rce,madmaxsucked,I'm sick and don't know why (Suboxone),"Got off banging $200 of dope a day about 5 years ago, and since then I've been taking suboxone. My dose has fluctuated, at times even early on I would go off like a 8mg strip/pill for a week, then at times I'd need more than that each day. 

This goes on for 5 years or so, and in recent months it's a been about a strip a week. Well, 2 weeks ago, I was taken off suboxone, under, err, forceful circumstances. Also, relevance, I was given 150mg of methadone forcefully that day and I ended up getting extremely sick and I think high, I don't really remember what an opiate high is like. It was a miserable feeling and traumatizing to be under an opiate high again after being off it for so long, I was crying when they gave it to me and I even managed to cheek out and spit out like half of it. In the night they came and shot me up something into my butt muscle as I was projectile vomiting everywhere.

 I was banging dope so long that the concept of getting high on heroin was as foreign as getting high on coca cola. It's 'shoot up the whole fucking $200 bag right now in the goddamn parking lot in the project as soon as my dealer rolls out because I can't wait 30 seconds to drive around the corner just so I can feel sick in 3-4 hours from now. Dark days but this is a long time ago now, I got clean and I've never relapsed, never wanted to relapse, never considered relapsing, I've even been around dope and I had to run to the bathroom and puke just from the sight of a needle. 

My physical addiction lasted much longer than my mental one did, but a good girl whom I had been dating for 2 years who had *no idea* I was using (she had never seen heroin before, I don't think she ever has, she just eventually found needles, and even that I explained away). I know a lot of guys get their girls hooked and have a heroin romance, but I wanted to keep her away from that world because I loved her so much. But, that didn't change the fact I was addicted. So with her help and suboxone, I kicked it. Sort of, I guess.

Anyways, it's been 2 weeks now (I don't know how much that methadone fucks shit up), and I still don't really feel right. I feel good enough that I can hit the gym, I can do martial arts, go the the beach, but my sexual confidence is pretty bad (dat dope dick go all night) and I just don't feel right.

Also, this is going to sound terrible, but I've been taking a lot of etizolam and LSD. I think the LSD is pretty harmless, but the etizolam is kinda supplanting one addiction for another. I have trouble sleeping at night, and I don't feel quite right during the day and the etiz helps. Just 1-2mg, I just want to use it until the suboxone withdrawal wears off.

Since I quit, especially in the last 2 years, I've done really well for myself. Lots of money, good social life, got a lot of shit done, I'm a competitive athlete, young, fit, healthy, no more cigarettes, I don't do anything unhealthy except the subs (no more), the etizolam (hopefully short term), and LSD (well that's not unhealthy that's just like my beer). I eat healthy, yoga, all that shit.

I just feel so unstable right now. I cry a lot, and I think it's partly the testerone from working out so hard, while also being so healthy (err, healthier, I'm not like at body dysmorphia stage yet, I'm not the smallest guy in the gym anymore but like the 2nd or 3rd smallest), but I feel an extra level of instability because of the withdrawal. Fuck, I don't even know if I'm in suboxone withdrawal or it's withdrawal from the etizolam.

off my chest I guess. I hate having to depend on medications, they tried to force me to take shit for bipolar and adhd (I don't have that shit, I mean maybe the latter a bit but nothing serious, I just have bad RLS that's all), I already had to rely on a medication, I'm never going back to that and I'm still struggling to truly get off it all.

One last note - I quit smoking a year ago, pack a day or so. Now, every once in a while I'll be in a smoking bars/venues (ugh, they're always the most fun) or smoke a single social cigarette, and the next day I'll be a little sick and it's a lesson I have to relearn. Whatever.

So 2 week ago, I smoked 4 cigarettes while partying hard for 2 days straight. I got super fucking sick, I am still coughing all the time, so hard that sometimes I puke a little in my mouth. Is this from the suboxone? It's like it's almost hard to put food into my belly, but I'm doing better now. 

ugh I'm so fucked. ",1436094427.0

There are hellish withdrawals from poppy pod tea, to opana, to fentanyl.

But you tell any law abiding citizen you use heroin and your a scumbag junky. But say you have a habit of snorting pain pills instead and its a milder reaction than the former.

I guess partly because its the popularity of heroin that gives it its stigma. All opiates can cause dependence and ruin lives, but the one opiate found easily all over the world is heroin so I guess people naturally regard it as the evilest drug out there.

I just get frustrated at opiate-naive people's reaction to heroin as opposed to all other opiates. Its not the strongest opiate out there, that I know.

Is it because of how fast it hits? The crack of the opiate family? I guess its comparable to the reaction people have when they hear coke vs crack. I guess its much like that.",1436083567.0

I hate it at times but it can also be somewhat rewarding. the low pay and late hours can suck but I find myself missing it a little. im trying to make money by playing music professionally but we all know how that goes in this day and age especially and we gotta pay the bills somehow so Im thinking of going back to cooking for another half year or so while I keep writing music. but this time I want to be realistic.

 last time I was just starting to cop a habit and spent most of my time dopesick but now that I am using daily it should be somewhat easier to keep working as long as I stay unsick. im also kind of stoked to meet some hot new girls.

I was using heroin, xanax, and alcohol daily.  The insanity of using as many drugs as possible on a daily basis was really taking a toll on my mental state.  Fantasizing more about suicide than getting more drugs is a dark place for an addict.  I spent many days on my way to Camden crying, wishing the choices I made were different.  Wishing my life wasnt this way.  But id always cop and get high.  Only really getting high two days out of the week.  Pure misery.

I left that inpatient facility after 32 days, and transferred to a halfway house by the Jersey Shore.  I then moved into an Oxford House a couple towns from my hometown.  Its a recovery house, essentially a house 7 guys live in and we dont drink or get high.

My first day in that house i went to a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, and got a sponsor.  Ive since changed sponsors, and am working on my 4th step of the program.  I help other addicts.  Im practicing willingness to change for the better.

Within the next few months,  Im starting my own private recovery house in another town.  Using connections Ive made at IOP programs and rehabs Ive spoken at, Ill be able to help more struggling addicts and also make a nice living for myself.  My parents trust me today, and are proud of me.  I have.true friends who would do anything for me without wanting anything in return.  Life is good.

Got a few of these Godzilla bags from one of the spots I used to frequent a few months ago and people had told me to go check it out the last few days so I checked them out and they are awesome, in this picture you can see the color of the dope it's real nice. For reference that's only half a bag.

Edit: damn this pic is small sorry everyone.

Smells fairly strong too, not always a good indication of strong dope but in this case it was. 
Philly peeps ask your buddies if they've had it recently it's definitely some of the better dope out there. 

I would rate the dope a solid seven or seven and a half out of ten all across the board, these are fairly fat size wise too and I've actually got a good nod going. Since I'm actually nodding and feeling great, I can't imagine I'll get sick after just a few hours - which is typical of crappier stuff that I've gotten here.

Here's my question.  I've got 10 generic (and old) hydrocodone/APAP (5/500).  Does anyone have any advice as to how best to use these to minimize the symptoms?  If i take 'em, will I just be prolonging the suffering?  I don't want to fuck my liver, either, but I don't have enough to make a CWE worth it. Do I wait to take a few (how many?) until once I start feeling it bad, or should I take some before it gets really bad to take the edge off?

I've got a little benzos to help too, and some zolpidem(ambien) for sleep but again, not a whole lot of either.

I just want to minimize the suffering.  I've done it before cold turkey and I am *really* not looking forward to that.  Any advice on how best to use what I've got, particularly the hydrocodone?   I know I'm going to feel like... shit... to put it mildly, I just hope some on here have some advice as to how, again, to *minimize* it.  I hope my question isn't extremely naive, I'm just scared.

whats the deal with legalized weed in certain states? are you allowed to grow forty thousand 10 foot tall trees in your backyard??? nope??? well then weed isn't legal. its dumb as hell. if weed is legal i should be able to plant as many pot plants on my property as i want whenever i want and nobody should be able to say a thing. i should also be able to give it away and sell it to whoever i want whenever i want just like a farmer would. i think society overall is stupid and annoying and these are the reasons im annoyed.

I know that ain't much compared to most of you guys but I seem to enjoy fucking up my life as fast as I can. My story is pretty normal, got started with my parents percs, tolerance rose and shit didn't cut it, so I started buying and selling oxy in the shitter, downtown area of my city. Like any reasonable junkie, I moved to dope cause it was cheaper, started dealing that, and somehow managed to support a huge habit without even having and job and still being in school by jus hustling and selling drugs. Eventually I got afraid and came clean to my parents and started going to an out patient rehab and NA meetings. Several relapses, psych wards, and months later, I finally fucked up hard enough for my parents to go through with their threats of sending me to a long term treatment center. Long story short over summer vacation I shot up dope in my grandparents bathroom and stole the majority of my mother's and grandmother's painkillers. Now I have family wishing I was dead or locked up and frankly I feel I might be better off ODed in that bathroom. Anyway, my summer drug bringe has worn off and I'm dope sick, going to Rehab in a week or so, and scared like a bitch. I had 90 days clean which is the longest I've ever had and I'm scared about gaining back trust, getting clean again, going to Rehab, and quiting for good. The only reason I'm not offing myself is that I don't want my parents to see that, and if I fail, I don't care to end up back in a psych ward again. 

edit: Thanks for all the helpful advice guys. If I don't reply much it's because I'm typing on a tablet. I forgot to mention I fucked up and was a enormous cunt and pointed a gun at my mother and tried to get her pain pills. Long story short, I didn't get the the cops came, and I crushed my phone against a cops car. They didn't charge me for reasons I'm not going to reveal publicly. Again, this psych ward stay fucked me up and let to several other stays but ultimately I realized I ain't gonna do it. I've seen to much people die and killed firsthand and It won't help shit.

I'm no stranger to opiates, I've used and abused them for almost 2 years now. There came a time when my entire family found out about my addiction and I became exposed. I had 2 choices, either keep using while my family abandoned me, or get help and keep my family. I chose the latter, I love my people more than I could ever love drugs so it was an easy decision... At the time...

I got ""help"", did a 60 day inpatient rehab program, went to NA every day thereafter. I was clean for 78 days until that fucker in my head got too loud and I relapsed.

Prior to being exposed as an addict, I would go hard in opiates. Nothing to brag about, I know, but I want to give you perspective. I was doing an upwards of 200mg of Oxycodone daily, from the moment I woke to the moment I passed out, I was high. This habit slowly built up of course, so in the 2 years I've been doing opiates, I'd say I was on this high of dosage and frequency for around 1 year. I stopped cold turkey when I got sent to rehab, it was hell as I'm sure some of you know, but whatever. Continuing on... 

So my first relapse after 78 days clean took place about 3 weeks ago. I've run the conversation in my head 1,000 times weather or not I am able to control this demon, if I am able to moderate my opiate usage. Not only moderate it, but make 100% sure NONE of my family was to ever find out I was using again, this meant I needed to develop some sort of ""code"" to not get caught. 

Since my initial relapse, I think I've had some control over this addiction. Maybe I'm fooling myself, that's why I wanted to see what you guys have to say. Including my first relapse 3 weeks ago, I've used a total of 3 times. That means I got high on Opiates once a week while following the code I've developed to not get caught, none of my family has a clue still. Part of the code I developed is to NOT get high more than once a week, I am limited to the amount of highs and this helps the whole moderation thing. 

So, I went from 200mg/DAY to roughly 40mg/WEEK. During the days I'm not getting high on Opiates, I hardly think of it, until day 5 or 6 rolls around, then I get real antsy and anxious, drooling over the thought of succumbing to opiates, that part worries me a bit. Day 1-4 I'm hardly thinking about it, but as the week draws to an end, all i can think about is getting lit. 

So back to my main question. With a little practice and determination, is moderation possible with opiates? Considering my story and how much I once used, to how much I'm using now, is there hope for me? Is there a possibility that I might be finally free? I don't want to kid myself, but the mind plays tricks on you, is this on it's tricks? Am I being lead to my grave and not even know it?

I can honestly see myself living the rest of my life like this, getting high once a week while following the code. I can't think of a single disadvantage while using opiates like this; no more dope sickness, not wasting a terrible amount of money, family is proud of me, I get to take a load off once a week, not being labeled as a pill popper (since one major rule of my code to NEVER tell anyone I'm using, that means I'm a lone wolf in the opiate game, but it's for the best. People talk, and some people know my family, so it's best to keep it on the hush hush).

Thanks guys, this isn't a brag post by any means whatsoever, I've been to the bottom of the barrel, I'm just trying to turn a new leaf and thought I could get some insight from the people that probably know me and this addition best.

So I have a question for anyone who really knows anything about PM Dr. Drug tests.  I know that there are all sorts of tests of varying specificity, but - in general - I am going to my Dr. in a week and if I get tested I need to actually FAIL (in the typical sense) the drug test for Hydrocodone.  

I am prescribed it every couple months for chronic pain and a recent bout with cancer (still kickin' though) and had a really bad week where I had to be on my feet a lot and was in absolute agony.  Long story short I had to overdo it a bit, I have a couple left for this week.  Im not worried about getting through this week, Ill have to survive regardless how bad it is.  

BUT - If I save this last half a pill - 2.5mg, is there a possibility I can take this at any time (i.e. late the night before or early the morning of) where it WILL show up on a drug test?  Additionally, if so, when is the best time to take it? Would any typical potentiation methods help make it show up? I know its not nearly enough to really do anything for me but I just need it to show up on the test.  

Thanks for any help!

Hey I'm not a frequent poster to this board but I'd like to share this resource which I feel should be able to help a lot of the users here. I'm not sure exactly how common knowledge this information is but I thought that it would be wise to try to inform as many people as possible.

The information in this ebook outlines a method to prevent and to some extent reverse opiate tolerance through the use of NMDA antagonists such as DXM, Memantine and Ketamine, among others. Also provided is a large amount of evidence in the form of scientific sources as well as some anecdotal reports as well. I can say that from my own anecdotal experience that this information is legitimate and was very helpful to me.

I'm not really sure who created this ebook but the neuroscience it outlines is rock solid and the methods while possibly requiring some individual tweaking are effective at reducing tolerance to a variety of drugs. Honestly I think the information in this pdf is so useful it should be sidebared.

I feel the only people unable to benefit from this would be those who have previously abused NMDA antagonists and have a tolerance to them.

There is more research to be done besides this ebook but this should give you an excellent foundation in understanding and mitigating tolerance and withdrawal.

I noticed that this ebook has been mentioned only in one other post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2w992v/the_opiate_tolerance_and_withdrawal_prevention/) however the OP uploaded it to a suspicious website so I've made sure to upload it to mega.

Here is a quote from the introduction:
>The information provided in this eBook will aid in; preventing tolerance to Opiates, preventing withdrawal from Opiates, preventing neurotoxicity from Opiates and enhancing the effects of Opiates. I am not claiming your tolerance level will be reset to that of a non-Opiate user, but I am claiming it will make a significant difference, not only in regards to enhancing the effects of Opiates, but also on while you aren‚Äôt using, as the lack of withdrawal allows you to live life more freely. The information in this eBook is not set in stone; everyone has different reactions to drugs, use this information as an aid in experimenting, to find what works for you.",1436279785.0

Real quick back story;
I had an IV heroin habit for 6 months and my family found out about it. I moved back home and have since gotten my shit together. I have a great job, and I've proven myself as responsible since then. Though a significant amount of time has passed between my usage and my sobriety, the good majority of my family treats me differently to this day. I mean, I don't blame them I suppose but it bothers me. Some of my aunts don't like me to be around their kids and they never trust me with money, which is strange because my habit never affected my family as far as me stealing/borrowing from them or whatever.
We have another family member with a pretty heavy oxy habit, but no one says a damn thing about it when he's nodding off at the table on the 4th of July. 
I guess I just hate that the stigma surrounding H leads to my family members not trusting me and being so unforgiving. Makes me want to pickup a pill habit because I guess it's deemed more ""acceptable""

Her old Dr in our old town finally said she needed to see a Dr in our area and she couldn't prescribe them anymore. So she goes to a new Dr and he flips shit that she is on xanax. She says that she had bad anxiety (her mom died which is why she was on them in the first place). He proceeds to tell her that ""kids these days crush these up and snort them"" and pretty much makes her feel like she is a drug abuser and that she abuses and sells her pills, which she lost certainly does not. He reluctantly writes a prescription for 30 but says it's the last one. He says she isn't solving the anxiety by taking anxiety medication and that she need to go on an ssri antidepressant.

My question is, is the lack of any odor any indication as to the purity?

Today is the first time I have ever used it.  I fill out the forms for the $1,500.00 certified check and let them cross reference my ID.  Then I took the certified check to the Santa Clara County Jail to bail out Rosie.  

Cops found Rosie in her car, passed out in the parking lot of Whole Foods.  Normally they let rich, professional drunks go when they sober up but Rosie mouthed off, got searched and had four empty bags of coke and a half burnt joint.  
""They impounded my car!"", she grumbles indignantly as I lead her out into the harsh, Californian sunlight.  She pauses, pulls sunglasses on and looks at me.

""How did you get here?""

""Bus.""

""Fahking unreal!"" she groans in disappointment.

This is an expression Rosie learned from me but it sounds better in her South American accent.

I was explaining how the bus schedule works when she waves her hand like I was a bug, yanks out her cellphone and calls a cab.  

""Do you have any coke?"" she asks after bumming one of my cigarettes.

""No.""

""Alright my place.  I need a line.  No!  Two lines.  And half a joint.  And coffee!  Police coffee tastes like sour, German ass.""

I don't ask.  

We walk to the curb to wait for the cab and pass a newspaper stand.  A picture of Rosie smiles from Metro Weekly.  I take one and read the article.

""Rising Tech Stars-"" But she cuts me off.

""Garbage!  Only useful for my CV.  They didn't put in the four plugs I needed.  Fucking bitch reporter.  Bryan is so pissed!  This makes me look narcissistic.  But good photo eh?  But the other three interviews are potato men.""

As Rosie showers, I watch CSPAN's coverage of NASA Mission Control.  My dream job.  I see an empty chair as engineers mill around.  That could be my chair if the story had a happy ending.  Calculating assist burn for Space Shuttle Columbia's  ascent.  Not waiting in this crazy coked up dyke's apartment after bailing her out of jail.  

I roll a thick joint of her weed and wonder if this counts as a work day?  Just the thought of going in the office fills me with sighs.  To get a good work mask on I must be high.  Not enough to push away dopesick pain, but HIGH.  And that...is a waste of drugs.

""You know you really need to start going to work"" says Rosie from her bedroom.  I smile and exhale the smooth, hydroponic green bud.  Seems the Universe sews me into places where I am wanted.  She smells the joint and looks in.

""Why are you smiling?  Are you high on drugs?"" demands Rosie as she takes the joint and hits it.

""Just a little.  You know how it is"" I respond semi truthfully.  

Luckily my sleeves are rolled down.  Luckily Rosie called me after my morning half shot.  Luckily I was lucid enough to follow the instructions for bail.  The Universe led me to this moment.  Rosie is right.  I need my job because I enjoy electricity, running water and opiates.  I'm no farmer living off my land.  I have no real world skills like fixing cars or cutting hair.  Sadly, my best contribution to society is as an office cog.

""Linda is ambitious"" warns Rosie as she smooths out the final touches in her bizarre, asexual power suit.  

Her transformation from a night in jail attire to this vicious, sleek corporate predator is startling.  I can learn things from Rosie.  She would share this con for she actually likes me.  But I'm too high to think about silly shit like that.  One day at a time.  That's what my therapist said in county rehab.

Ah Linda.  I hired her myself.  Trained her to do the things I hate and she slowly took over.  At first I bossed her around.  She was a meek thing and enjoyed instruction.  But I am gone more than half the week.  She learned to fend for herself.  When people come by to ask about projects they acknowledge me but ask Linda all the serious stuff.  

She has stolen my glow and lo and behold- Linda shines brightly.  I see it.  They see it.  I'm just too tired to care.  

""Ok I'll go"" I say looking at my watch.  It is 10:50am.  Pop in, show my face and go to lunch.  Read some news, get high and go home.  I can do this.  For one thing I have 3 roxys in my coat pocket.  Just enough to bleed out the day.

Walking in with Rosie is a trip.  A corporate power trip.  Her meticulous look and South American accent make her an exotic, magnetic, powerful thing.  People worship her.  They sense her star is on the rise.  And trailing in her stardust is the only reason people put up with me. 

So many clamor for her favor or a bit of her time.  They see Rosie on TV and worship her media status in this temple of greed.   Why does Rosie like me?  She is an ambitious woman and I am lazy man.  Yet we are twins.  Venom twins.  Many times I have caught her and carried her home.  She has returned the favor.  We shield each other from truths and allow the fantasy world to continue uninterrupted.  I don't want to fuck her and she does not want to fuck me.  Just removing that layer makes us closer.  Less bullshit.  

We pull up to the compound while Rosie barks instructions to her assistant Mitch.  Get my car out of impound!  Sic lawyers on the cops!  Get a copy of the arrest report!  12:30 lunch reservations as Shiono's and so on and so forth as I pay the the cabbie.  We walk inside and sense things are off instantly.  People are milling around like zombies.  Brainless and lost.  

""Internet is out"" explains the lobby receptionist.  I pop my first roxy.

Without screens to focus on human interaction is happening.  I am very uncomfortable.  When Rosie storms off I am lost.  I feel the first blue hitting me and go the restroom to rail the second one.  60 mg should help.  This one caresses the back of my brain and I go to my desk.  Linda appears instantly for a meeting.  

""Linda I just got here.  I need to check my email-""

""The internet is down.  You owe me a status meeting.  So let's start with red tier projects"" drones Linda all puffed up with self importance.  

She looms over me with her list and it feels like a police interrogation.  I stare at her balefully as she recites the events that transpired while my brain was off planet.  She opens up a binder and starts to read off agendas, reports and communications that she has meticulously culled into her demonic tome. 

""Did you see Robinson's email about the commerce section?""

""No.""

""Have you had a chance to look at the Kennedy/Flaig partnership?""

""No.""

""Have you-""

""Look Linda, I gotta go poo.""  

I stand up and walk away smiling.  I wanted to say 'shit' but my brain screamed 'No!'.  For some reason 'poo' came out.  What a marvelous word.  I realize that was a huge transgression but when she reports me, everyone will smirk when she says 'poo'.  Ah fuck me.  Oh well.  I can't complain about Linda.  She is merely doing her job.  And my job.  Plus, I did hire her.

Man, the office is too bizarre without internet.  I am not the only one weirded out now that we are cut off from the internet teat.  When the reports come in that the city of Mountain View road crews damaged a huge section of communication repeaters, the engineers were the first to leave.  

Ben is agitated and tells me, ""This is fucked!  The infrastructure is fucked.  Internet should not come from a fucking wire like a goddamn telegraph service!  It should come from the sky!""

""The sky?"" smiles the receptionist Minnie who was hired on her merits.  Today a blue crystal dangles hypnotically above her v-necked merits.

""Yes!  The sky!  Like Skynet.  In fact Minnie, it should be ILLEGAL to be offline!""

And Ben storms off.

""Did I upset him?"" asks Mary looking worried.  

I don't think any of us have ever seen Ben angry.  And no one has ever seen him leave early.  A common myth is that Ben lives in the building.  The sleeping bag, refrigerator and dresser in his cubicle do little to dissuade this.    

""Naw.  Don't worry about Ben.""

I am trying to just sneak off but the roxy magic makes me social.  I can sense Minnie is going to ask me something so I lean on the counter and wait.

""Do you think we, like the admins, have to stay if the internet is broken?"" 

She smiles and is sitting up straight.  I am an old pro with busty females and do not fall into the cleavage trap.  I will not look.  But fuck, I am also high and I really don't care what she does.

""I'm not your boss Minnie.  I'm leaving.  Seems pointless to stay-""

""Thanks!""  

And like that she scoops up her jacket, grabs her travel mug of coffee and skips out the door.  Tra la la la la.  I smile and follow her.  Fuck this place.

I wake up to a 6:50 am. alarm.  Why?  Then I hear it.  Snoring.  Seriously loud snoring.  Sera.  She snores like a man.  I look around as the clock SCREAMS.  I am on the couch in the living room.  Sunlight slices through the blinds and a knife beam hits Mycroft the fish illuminating his midnight blue armor.  He stares at me expectantly. 

I walk down the hall.  In the bedroom I see Sera buck naked, face down and snoring on my bed.  What an ass.  I know she is shy about her weight but damn.  You just want to sink your teeth into that fleshy paradise.  And I probably did last night even though Sera is someone's girlfriend.  We have a complicated relationship.

I sit next to her, turn off the alarm clock.  Once I'm awake my mind goes into math mode.  It was around 1:30 am when I took a half shot in the bathroom.  I sneak these in because Sera has seen me OD and worries.  But this batch is on the weak side.  The Gargoyle gets the shit Mexican black tar, some ECP/Dragon and Roxicodone 30mg.  I prefer the roxy over the Mexican but my tolerance is through the stratosphere these days.  Pills are expensive.  Three for $40 and I need all three to touch the god.  So black tar in my blood is pure economics.  I don't feel the pain but sense it is coming.  Mornings are hard on me.  My flesh is like stone and I just want to lay there and suffer.  There is only one cure. 

I get my kit which is hidden under my desk drawer and go into the bathroom.  Yawning, I cook up a batch, tie myself off and inject a bit above the last one.  I should be more careful.  Don't want to crush a vein.  I clean myself up, wipe away the blood and use antibiotic ointment and a bandaid.  As my nod gallops across the sea towards my weary spirit, I spray aerosol air freshener and clean up.  

When I was ""sober"", I was an alcoholic pothead.  I ate a lot.  I loved Indian food, Persian and Mexican.  Chinese food and salads were constant.  I would kill the bathroom every morning with a humongous, healthy bowel movement.  And I would spray this aerosol air freshener.  I haven't shit for 3 days or eaten much besides candy and soda.  But now I spray it not for shit but for that unpleasant vinegar tang of Mexican black tar boiling on a spoon.  I walk out to wake Sera.

""Hey!  Get up!""  

""What the fuck!"" she yells popping up.  Then she see's me and smiles.  ""Oh.  Hey...hi.""

I collapse next to her as the smack circulates within my body easing up the tensions of life.  Sera lays next to me and strokes my face.  I am high and this feels nice.  I know this is where I send mixed signals but I am only flesh and bones.  This room is stark white, the color all apartments come in.  My curtains are Mars red and the sun burns beyond them one astronomical unit away.  When transfused with sunlight, Sera's purple eyes glow violet.  When she stares at me, I am transfixed.  

""We were both sleeping on the couch after we uh you know..."" smiles Sera pushing her face into my neck and cheek.  Sera nuzzles politely.  She never bites.  She waits for you to take her.  

But I remain still.  Waiting for the god to take me.

The god is spreading my love across the cosmos.  Bits of me are disintegrating to the stars.  The sacrifice of another day lost.  I left many untied bits yesterday when I said rude things and left.  I see my phone blinking but I turned off it's voice.  Silence is needed.  Respect for the god.

""You were yelling last night.  Again"" sighs Sera.  

""Sorry.""

""You pushed me away"" says Sera as she props herself up to look at my face.

I don't need to ask.  My dream is always the same dream.  

""You were talking to her"" says Sera sadly as she strokes my face.

I look away.  I DID feel her.  Often I do not.  Usually it is just the dark corridor where my pain echoes and touches nothing.  Nothing at all.  But last night for a moment I know she was watching. I was focused on my lighter during the cook and those clear blue eyes peered back.  I almost dropped the spoon.  Almost.

But now it is morning.  Sera is taking her wake and bake bong hit and I am staring at the ceiling.  Rational.  There is a lot of blue in a butane flame.  More oxygen        in the mix makes it fully combustible...right?  I take the lighter as Sera hacks up a huge roiling cloud of marijuana smoke.  I flick it and stare through the smoke.  Not much blue, but a little.   ",1436202633.0

And i ended up being sent to see a counselor to assess whether or not I'm fit to work and whether or not I have a substance abuse problem.

I've jumped through all their hoops since this happened, somehow managing to make the best possible outcome in every way imaginable. 

On Monday i went to see this counselor that i mentioned and as part of her assessment she wanted me to take a short test called the SASSI, or Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory. I had never heard of this test so i was a little perturbed at being given a test that would supposedly tell them if I'm addicted to drugs. Or rather i guess it's to tell if you are susceptible to being addicted to drugs

So, I racked my brain and took this test knowing nothing about it before hand.. I studied every question and tried to answer as honestly as possible (not trying to be an angel while also not making myself seem like a drug addict) and take this test quickly. I didn't want to take too long and have them think i was studying it. I don't know if time actually factors in.

So, i went back the next day and to my surprise they told me that i scored as low as i possibly could in so far as the being addicted to drugs. Also, i scored a 3 where they tried to tell how honest i was. Lower scores were better here and the lowest is a 2, i believe... Apparently it's good i scored a 3 and not a 2 though, because lower scores in defensiveness indicate depression, i was told, and if i scored a 2 they would be worried that i was going to kill myself.

So, i guess, getting to my point, what do people know about this test? The internet tells me it's supposed to be pretty accurate and also admissible in court apparently. Am i just really good at taking tests? Do i not have as much of a problem as i think? Am i lucky?

I'm guessing a mixture of being awesome and lucky, because i feel like I'm definitely an addict. I'm not a daily user, but i would be if it was economically feasible..",1436370945.0

I've cut back on my use significantly over the last few months. I've been picking up maybe once every 2 weeks max and it will last 2-3 days. So last night after dinner I go pick up a G and rush home. Once I'm home and settled into my bedroom and ready to prepare a shot I notice it's really hard tar and tough to break any off. I didn't have access to a knife in my room and didn't want to make my roommate wonder why I'm bringing a knife into my room. 

So I finally break off a piece but it was really small. It has been 2 or 3 weeks since I've last used so I figured this would be a good tester amount. I shoot up and it felt great, was just enough to get me where I wanted to be. Fast forward several hours and my roommate has gone to sleep and I feel ready to do more. This time I am downstairs in the living room with a knife and I cut off a chunk. It was about 3 times the size as my first piece and I remember thinking that this was really gonna be pushing it. 

Being the idiot I am I throw safety out the window and prep it. I remember doing the shot and thinking to myself I might have fucked up. The next thing I remember is I'm starting to come to in the kitchen floor. I'm on my hands and knees crawling and gasping for air. My left leg and arm have horrible pins and needles. I have no idea how or why I went to the kitchen after the shot. Possibly to go to the sink to puke?

I have no idea how long I was passed out on the kitchen floor but it must of been awhile to cause my limbs to go numb and tingly from laying on them. They were so painful I couldn't stand, only crawl. As I start to come to and realize what happened I start getting a tremendous headache. I was still slightly confused but I remember I had an overwhelming urge to keep wanting to lay back down and go to sleep on the kitchen tiles. I refused to let myself lay down and kept slowly crawling. I was finally able to start breathing normally and was eventually able to stand. I immediately felt like I had to puke and so I hobbled to the bathroom and puked my guts out. 

This was a horrible and terrifying experience. I have no idea how close to death I was but I feel like I was close. I will never forget that confused feeling, desperately trying to breathe while crawling on the kitchen floor to keep myself awake, the pain in my leg and arm from passing out on them, and the pounding headache slowly creep in. 

I know I'm lucky to be alive and I broke so many of the rules last night we all preach to stay safe. When I was finally done puking I went back to the living room and saw all my gear still on the floor and my Dr. Pepper was still full. I have no idea why I went into the kitchen before collapsing. The only thing I can think of is that I needed to puke and was going for the sink or that I knew something was wrong and was trying to keep myself moving so I wouldn't pass out. 

Sorry for the rambling. I'm still shaken up but I've learnt my lesson on being an idiot. Never again will I be so negligent. 

TL;DR
Used for the first time in almost 3 weeks. Took a small tester shot, got wreckless and did a huge shot. Somehow passed out on the kitchen floor. Woke up sometime later gasping for air and half my body tingling from laying on the tile floor for an unknown amount of time. ",1436370640.0

I left the east coast shooting around .1-.2 of crazy good powder and moved out west for a few months. By the time I left I had jacked my tolerance to needing a half of really good tar for a good shot and I could tear through 1.5 over the day. This tar stood toe to toe with good ECP and I think I screwed up underestimating the potential potency overall of tar.

Now I'm back out east where a half of power is much more expensive and I'm starting to think the tar I was getting was actually better. My love affair has been hot and heavy and only going on for a year, I jumped onto shooting pretty much immediately because I was already IVing stims and in the beginning I enjoyed having a half last three days in the beginning. Wow, if I could only get back to that point but alas, those days are gone.

I spent 10+ years as a hevy active alcoholic along with benzos and coke for a handful of years, the high tolerance game is nothing new to me but with dope this is totally uncharted territory for me. It's only been a year and I've given myself a crash course on opiate dependence and I need the size shot of much more seasoned opiate users, what the fuck.

I've come to accept that my love/hate relationship with opiates still leans towards the love part but 60-80 bucks for a good shot is just not logical to pursue.

I think I could try fixing up once in a while as an occasional treat but not with my current tolerance. How long do I need to abstain until my tolerance will go back down to a sane level? Furthermore, how easily will my tolerance be back in full swing if I do use?
 

My tolerance to alcohol is porked after drinking like i did for a decade but I'm wondering if there is still hope that I can get my opiate tolerance down to a sane level? If I can I will do my best to preserve it but if I can't then the only solution is to get to a place where I say goodbye to opiates permanently. Any help would be much appreciated.

Oh and as a side note, I like hanging out on this sub and answer the occasional question too since I do have a smidge of experience and also took subs for 6-7 months after a knee jerk outpatient got me on them.

Anyway, I've been a pretty bad opiate addict for 4-5 years now. Have tried quitting cold turkey, have tried self-medicating with subs, but never seem to last longer than 2-3 months. (In other words, I've gotten WELL past the acute WD's. But then I eventually rationalize that I can handle ""one more high"" and ultimately get fully back into the game again.)

I'm really serious about quitting, and I'm strongly considering methadone. I'll do nearly ANYTHING to get off this junk. I live in a big city with lots of clinics. I popped inside one a few days ago called ""START treatment"" and obtained an information sheet. It states the following (consolidated to include just the most relevant items):

2 day process --
DAY 1: Screening + intake by counselor. Meeting with mental health supervisor.
DAY 2: Meeting with medical team. Then, go to admin office for final admission. Receive an ID card and then get medicated for first time. Assigned a counselor. Required to attend orientation mtg's 1x/week for first 4+ weeks.

Here are my questions before I commence this process:

1. How long am I expected to be ""clean"" off junk when I attend that day 1 meeting? One of my biggest obstacles the past times I've tried to quit is that I cave in & relapse 48-72 hrs in. Will they refuse me if my last dose was ~48 hours ago (long enough that I'm having full-fledged WDs)?

2. What's the estimated cost if I don't have any health insurance whatsoever? (Cost of initial consult, cost per day, etc). I'm in NYC if that helps.

3. How long should I expect to be on MMT? If I taper properly, is it possible to get off within a year or two, and/or eventually switch to something like suboxone?

4. I want to move to New Jersey for a higher paying job opportunity there. Would I have to commute to NYC each day to remain on MMT? Or, will my MMT ID card work in NJ? If I have to restart the process from my 1st bullet point, how long do you think I'll have to commute daily to NY for my dose until I'm approved in NJ?

Sorry if these questions are redundant/Google-able. I'm just really anxious/scared about this process & want to cover all my bases before committing to something huge like this. Thanks and lots of love!

P.S. As a way of paying it fwd, if you guys take the time to answer this barrage of questions, I 100% promise to contribute some money to a harm reduction charity as soon as I can afford to.

Through massive experimentation I discovered that with the addition of a very small amount of baking soda the gelling was reduced and the potency soared.  After crushing I mix in a small amount, getting this continuously right is critical! I use a car key, dipping it in the soda until I reach the first indent and tapping the excess off until only the ridges are full of soda.  I put in two of these ""keys"" and mix throughout.  Then when insufflating I snort really deep and progressively pull the Tooter farther out after each line. 
  I do not know the exact reason this helps but I have a theory.  As the powder becomes wet it begins to gel.  This gelling happens because the molecules start to polymerize, or join together in large chains.  At the same time the soda, reacting with water begins to release bubbles of carbon dioxide.  These bubbles (I think) interfere with the gel trying to polymerize, thus reducing gel formation.  Think of it like the powder as people, as the powder gets wet the people begin to reach out and hold hands to form chains like the molecules in polymerization.  Now imagine the bubbles of carbon dioxide as dodge balls being thrown at the people, as they hit the people they let go of each other and the chains fall apart. 
 This is just a theory but I've tested it with and without the baking soda at least 100 times.  I am curious to see if anyone else has or is willing to give it a try and see what happens.

3cipgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3cipgn/how_i_got_my_shit_together/,8,https://redd.it/3cipgn,mommyIdontWantcancer,How I got my shit together.,"Okay so I had been a pretty avid drug user since I was about 15. It started with weed and psychedelics and by the time I was 17 I had tried about everything shy of heroin and meth. Now during this time I never had a ""problem"" but I was smoking weed daily and would eat some mushrooms at a concert every once in a while and maybe eat a few percs or some morphine with a buddy. But never more than once a month in the stuff other than weed. 
I have always had bad add too so I never did well in school because I just had no interest in the subject matter. But I had a good buisness mind and found that interested me. So I started selling items online when I was 15 and actually made good money.
So fastfoward to me being 18 having a hard time over a girl (long story) and end up getting arrested with 14 grams of come and 100 ectasy pills at a concert. I had been selling weed for a few years and had recently been making a bunch of money selling coke. But I go arrested had to live at home and slowly slipped into a bad iv come and heroin habit. 
It was easy to hide in till summer rolled around and my 10k of drug money was gone. Not to mention my veins looked like a used crackpipe. 
This carried on for 2 years and I was in methadone for 6 months (90 mg) and got a dui. So for legal purposes I detoxed off of methadone at a two week center. It was actually painless and pretty comftorble with the exception of some back pain for about a week after I left. 

SKIP HERE IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT MY PERSONAL HISTORY (I won't hold it against you) 

But the real life saver in all of this had been two things. Number one is KRATOM. To this day I use a little each day to help with my anxiety, add and cravings. It costs less than 2 dollars a day if your buy in bulk. And it can be used as a safer cheaper and in my opinion more effective alternative to methadone. It really helped me get my life togathet

The second thing is an anti depressant 
I'M NOT RECOMMENDING EVERYONE GO AND TAKE SOME PROZAC. BUT.. it maybe worth setting up an appointment to look into. it did take a bout 3 weeks to tell a difference but by that 4th week I was literally a new person. Its as if a switch was flipped on my head. I am happier than I have ever been and my motivation is at an all time high. I made a bit over 4k last month and I'm just super happy. 

I hope this post will help at least someone. Thanks for your time y'all are awesome!",1436333745.0

This is a new account created specifically to post these (I needed a new one anyway for my drug posts). I hope you enjoy!*

**Chapter 1**

1.
Standing there, holding them in my hands, I feel nothing but an intense curiosity. Drugs are foreign to me. The word itself carries a dirty taste on my tongue. They are white. I had only recognized them because they were mentioned so often in the rap lyrics I was so fond of. Oxycodone--that was the name. My sheltered life has never even afforded me a shot of liquor, let alone real drugs. How does one even take these? Are they snorted, or taken by themselves? Better to cover all my bases, I decide. I swallow one, washing it down with a sip of cola. Crushing half of the second one, I roll a banknote, like in the movies. Sniff. God, that burns. This cannot be correct. The remaining half goes down in the traditional manner to join the first.

How long do these things take to kick in? Twenty minutes or so have passed, and I am rapidly growing anxious. Cursing myself for my stupidity, I try to piece together exactly what led to this moment. It is fall 2010, and I am alone in the world, or so it would seem. This should be my sophomore year of high school, but instead I am not in school at all. I was in school. My ninth grade year was spent in a religious boys‚Äô boarding school on the other side of the city. Spare the rod, spoil the child, that was their doctrine. Not that they needed a rod. I found myself in plenty of fights. If you want to beat each other up, keep it in the dorms. That‚Äôs what they told us. I always win fights. I fight dirty. Padlocks for brass knuckles, that sort of thing. They told me to pack my things and go home about a month into this year, though. ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt buying what we‚Äôre selling.‚Äù the headmaster told my parents. What they were selling, I‚Äôm still unclear on. Leaving was fine. It was in a rough area of town. I was on a first name basis with some of the hookers down there, and had learned how to walk so as not to draw attention to myself. I‚Äôve seen men get beaten down for less than a stray look. Now I‚Äôm back home. Officially, I‚Äôm homeschooling, but the truth is I spend my days aimlessly wandering the neighborhood, looking for the wrong crowd to get involved with. Good kids, really. Or not, but they accept me. Accept me. Accept m...

 Suddenly, God himself hugs me. Every fiber of my body feels his embrace. It is like coming home. Pain, worry, sadness: these emotions become foreign to me. There is only this... whatever it is. But before I am ready to let go of him, God pushes me away, and I fall to the ground roughly. 

I need more. The white trash suburbs are abundant with such vices, and soon I find a steady supply with the kid from down the street. His name is Nathan, and he has only one vice. He loves food. Morbidly obese, he has a penchant for pulling entire zebra cakes and slices of pizza out of the pocket of his sweats. But he does have a lot of painkillers, and gladly trades them for a few dollars to get his next fix of sugar and trans-fats. We have a mutually parasitic relationship, killing each other with what we love most.

‚ÄúAre you interested in weed?‚Äù he asks one day.

‚ÄúNever tried it.‚Äù I respond. His eyes light up.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll love it.‚Äù he emotes, and proceeds to overcharge me for what I will later understand is the most terrible marijuana one can possibly find.

Riding my bike into the depths of this white bread neighborhood, my crudely constructed highlighter marker and tin foil pipe tucked in the pocket of my windbreaker, I search for a secluded spot. This whole suburb reeks of failed dreams and spousal abuse, white trash kids with white trash parents, the residue left by the fuckups of the baby boomer generation. As I clumsily spark my devil‚Äôs lettuce, I hope it offers an escape. If not, my next stop is back home where I have a few roxys stashed away. My pipe works, barely. As I feel the harsh smoke dig into my throat, I fight the urge to cough. Several puffs later, I give up. A nearby park bench beckons, and I sit down, waiting for something to happen. It does, almost imperceptibly. The grass looks slightly greener, the birds sound slightly more musical, and I feel slightly more at peace. I could get used to this, I think. Still, though, I prefer the little blue babies sitting in my desk drawer. I head home and crush one up, hugging God as he assures me I am safe in his arms.
	
**Chapter 2**	It must be early spring. Dad and I are spending some quality time up in the Colorado mountain town of Estes Park. He is getting old--too old for the hikes we used to go on up here. In his early sixties, all he wants to do is rest. I don‚Äôt appreciate him. In fact, all I want to do is be by myself. Besides, I have been talking to a girl I met on some crappy chat app, and she lives up here. Her name is Britta.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going over to the Starbucks.‚Äù I tell my dad. She and I have agreed to meet there. On my way out the door, I pop a couple percocets. They help me socialize, and I need this girl to like me. She talks on my wavelength. We both want nothing more than to be deadbeat druggies, and hate our parents.

I‚Äôm high out of my mind by the time she shows up. We hit it off instantly. She is a bit younger than I am, but just as tall, with blonde hair cropped just above the shoulders to frame her angular face, and deep blue eyes that reflect my own. After a cup of espresso, I need to stop sitting still. The opiate buzz has a distinct edge to it too. There is nothing to do in this backwards mountain town. I offer her a blue pill. She says no, but I can see her eyes linger on it before I put it back in my pocket. We end up at the supermarket, dressing up an enormous stuffed Easter rabbit in whatever we can find, then leave him in the produce section. I find it hilarious because I‚Äôm high. She finds it hilarious because I find it hilarious. Outside we share a cigarette and laugh. She is looking at me, and I at her. I wonder if she is as happy to meet me as I am to meet her. For the rest of the trip, I ignore my dad in favor of spending time with Britta. If he is hurt by this, I hardly notice. Lost in the allure of this blonde haired headcase, it would take World War III to tear me away. When I head home, Britta and I promise to keep in touch.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
It must be summer. A lot has happened for me in the past few months, none of it good. I‚Äôve had my first relationship. It lasted all of two weeks back in March before I broke up with her. She was my first, but I felt nothing for her. She disliked my drug habits, and I disliked how fat she was. In any case, I was moving to Denver. It was useless to try keeping her around. The breakup was ugly for her, but I felt nothing. If I did, a pill nipped that in the bud. God didn‚Äôt hug me anymore, he just held my hand...

Sometime in early summer, Britta and I met up in Boulder, the yuppie town at the base of the Rocky Mountains. There, I smoked good pot for the first time. I recall stumbling into the street, barely able to believe that this feeling was possible. Britta followed with me, and some time later we found ourselves kissing as though time itself stood still. It felt good in the moment. We even took a picture. I suppose it was the only way to make it last longer, to bring it back with us into our own hellish lives.

We met at the mall on the day my old house sold. Smoking a cigarette outside, we felt as though the world could never touch us. Outside the food court, I offered her my baby blues once again. This time she said yes with no hesitation. It was her first opiate, and far from her last. How was I to know? We snuck out to her mom‚Äôs car, high as kites, making out with a lack of expectations that only innocence can produce. Standing there in the midsummer sun, my hand reaching up her miniskirt, I pulled her closer. Presently, her friend and her mom came out, and we both feigned sobriety until I got dropped off, surreptitiously feeling each other up all the while. God hugged both of us that day.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

She is the one I called from the psych ward after my suicide attempt, the only one whose number I knew by heart. We had just moved to Denver, and I knew no one. I had no source for drugs, and my parents refused to even let me leave the house. It took no more than a week before I snapped and tied a belt to the clothes bar in my closet. I remember hearing a crack as it broke and I fell to the ground, defeated, my darkest moment becoming a blubbering panic attack. My mother found me, surrounded by crumpled clothing, staring into the distance, crying and hyperventilating. 

Britta  understood. Somehow, she always understood. She had her own history of mental illness. No wonder she fell in love with my blues. She did more than me by now. When I got out, I managed to see her on the far side of Denver while her mom underwent some medical procedure. We shared one final kiss. Maybe two or three, tinged with the chemical taste of synthetic opioids. Unbeknownst to me, I would not see her again for nearly four years. She would be changed and matured by circumstance and age, as would I. Jaded against the evils of the world, forging our own paths, I would respect her for the courageous and headstrong woman she had become, and hate myself for losing touch, for never making that final move. At one point, she had wanted to give her virginity to me, and I wanted her to have my soul. Now, I lay awake, thinking of those baby blue days, and the future we never shared. We are a casualty of the war I waged against myself. A war that was far from over.

Just a couple years ago there's a good chance this case would have never even made it to the fourth.  I must be getting lame in my old age.

I'm making a concerted effort to get drunk tonite.  The last doctor only wrote me a script for 60 norcos over two weeks ago and they've been out since saturday.  I'm really tired of being in pain.  I'm doing everything I can to deal with this shit in every possible non narcotic, non substance use way but it isn't enough.  I'm gonna guzzle this piss beer til I either don't feel the shit or just stop giving a fuck about it. Either one works.

These pain management fucks better do something about this.  I go see them friday.  With the help of the awesome posters here I've got a pretty good game plan for how I'm going to approach the doctor.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm in legitimate pain, you can take one look at me and tell I'm all fucked up dealing with some pretty serious shit.  I'm legitimately exhausting all my non narcotic avenues for pain management, and I legitimately don't want to be super fucked up on like four oxy 80s a day or want to be taking shit for more than the next couple months while my leg and neck heal.  I wouldn't even be taking anything if it weren't for almost being killed.  I had been sober for like six months when I got hit.  I don't want to go back to being hooked on narcotics and feel like I need them to function or make my life complete.  But right now I need to get back to work, and it's just not happening without some kind of narcotic assistance right now.  I'm living at my mama's because of all this, I'm 28 years old, this is not where I want to be for the next year of my life.  All the money that I had managed to put back while I was working (one of the advantages of not blowing your wad on a bunch of drugs) has started to dwindle.  I've got to be here for another month at least while I recover enough to be able to live on my own, but when I get to that point I need the money to be able to pay rent somewhere and I'm not going to have it if I'm not drawing a check.  It wouldnt be as big of an issue if my moms house wasnt a half hour away from where i work.  Ive got a place lined up and my best bro and his wife (who happen to run the place i work) are gonna let me take over the lease but ive got to be able to get back working full time to pay the bills and feed myself.

I don't even give a fuck about the drugs themselves at this point in my life, I just want to go back to work and start regaining mobility in my leg.  When you come close to truly losing everything you really start to appreciate the little things.  That's something I never got through my almost 15 years of drug use.  Even though something terrible has happened to me, I don't feel bad about myself or depressed about my situation.  I feel lucky to be alive. Even being without any kind of opiates I dont feel bad for myself or get bummed out about things, im just really, really, REALLY fucking sore.  I hope that those of you that are on the high level junkie life can come to feel that way about your lives without the overwhelming need for narcotics.  It's fucking liberating.  I just hope you don't have to get locked up several times and almost get killed to get there.

So I'm just gonna sit here with my beer and browse all the crazy shit yall are getting yourselves into.",1436327823.0

[Recent encounter with fake GG249's described],"I imagine most of you either actively fuck with benzos or just when you withdrawal but, either way here is a heads up and it is not a new warning. 

(A little background to get us started, not a fucking rook ya bish)
I'm a polysubstance kind of guy. Before upgrading to powder (just snorting, banged once) and even still, I was just a CNS-depressant fiend. Incredibly dangerous. I would have access to 5 different types of benzos, with an incredibly high tolerance and an incredibly high oxy/hydrocodone tolerance to boot. I would often be as reckless as to take several bars, a couple milligrams of klonopin, 50 mg valium or so, 2 or 3 mg ativan, 120 mg temazapam, alongside 80 mg oxy, 100 mg hydro (10 norc 10s or what have you), 2.5 ounces promethezine codeine 10/625, soma or zanaflex (because I literally did not care about dying I suppose), and a pack or two of dope. Absolutely nuts, incredibly expensive 1000 dollars 4 or 5 day binges that when respiratory depression is discussed, are all an ideal combo for discontinuing that breathing shit we do. But, albeit some instances of waking up hours later from a ""nap"" on a sidewalk after i likely lowered my breathing so that it knocked me unconscious, nothing severe happened (no hospital visits, no damaged brain in a comatose state, no death, etc.). **I don't recommend this recipe to anyone**. It's likely the next option down for lethal injections if Midozalam and other barbiturates where not available (I believe the intended cause of death with the current mix of lethal injection meds is CNS-depression -- hopefully -- or more severally and disturbingly cardiac arrest).

**But to get to the point** here is what happened to me for the first time -- ran into the fake GG249's. Never made a false step with pills, burnt a bunch with boy, never with pills, as any slouch with internet access can simply ""pill id that shit."" If you aren't avidly into benny's, be aware that the most commonly spoofed 2 mg bar are the GG249s. Don't get me wrong, I've ran into them many times before and they were the legitimate Sandoz make, but if you here GG249 on the other line, make sure to inspect those bitches. So I lost a couple hundred dollars which sucks (I was paying 3.50 per) and I ended up just sitting on them, cuz I'm not a fucking dick. But before I relate the GG249's to my introductory story up above, let me just describe to you what these fucking things look like.

- They are way fatter than the Sandoz model variety
- The edges are not rounded, but have near 90 degree corners
- The pill itself just looks and feels like something you would find in an assortment of loose vitamins -- it just clearly isn't an FDA approved tight generic build ya dig?
- Indent on its side (likely from the shitty pill press)

So I tried them, a lot of them, as I was in a situation in which I thought I might run into some piglets, so with 40 or so on me, I just thought, well, they likely contain melotonin or some filler, no harm in just swallowing chalk. Mistake. Big fucking mistake. I knew they were thought to have contained phenazepam or some non-controlled benzo (I'm sure it varies -- I'd love to know why if anyone knows this pill has been monopolized into duds where as S903s, R039s, G3722 seemingly haven't been). I've run into non-generic Xanax in my time, but I was well aware it wasn't scripted to anyone, likely came from an online supplier like the Silk Road, but likely actually contained alprazolam powder (not sure where this is purchased but nonetheless).

So I ended up in the hospital somehow, with my breathing rate so slow, they wouldn't let me leave until 5 or 6 in the morning. They also dosed me with that anti-overdose drug (insert: naxolone), and I was slightly high on a bump or two of boy, but certainly not to warrant that shit (I remember that vividly, strange feeling to be injected with that shit). They simply assumed I had od'd on heroin, but I knew the GG249s were the culprit. They said I came critically close to dying of repository depression, but don't they always say this?
 

So, I suppose the moral of the story here is be careful when copping da GGs. If you aren't familiar with the Sandoz model you won't have the real deal to compare against as you feel for grooves and size and such, but take a visual dive online quickly to see the real thing (on drugs.com they are said to measure 15 mm, this is bullshit, they are shorter. actually the fakes measured 15) and then if you do end up with bullshit don't eat a bunch although I would prefer what happened to me then a run in with tha piglets.

Some more thought...

I doubt these were pressed by an individual, more likely some ""lab"" in India, purchased in mass quantity over the internet, distributed in mass quantity into large city -- I'm assuming thousands if not hundreds of thousands of these fucking things. Maybe not, I have no idea. 

TL;DR: I described in detail bullshit, fake GG249s. I found myself in a situation where it seemed best to eat all 40 bars that were on me. admitted into hospital, shot up with naxolene as they assumed OD heroin, discharged 5 or 6 am after entering around noon the previous day. wallet is half a grand lighter.

Today on my refill day my pharmacy switched brands on me and gave me these NP - 12, pink 10mg oxycodones. They're made from a company called Zydus or something.

Anyway, they have a weird rubbery texture, and they don't seem to be working as well as my normal/old script.

Anyone have experience taking these? As a customer do I have a right to take these back to the pharmacy to get a different brand or am I just shit out of luck...or is this just all in my head?",1436307107.0

I usually can get them open but this last batch of pieces I picked up I can't for the life of my get the god damn things open. 

This results in cutting them in half with a knife and then basically squirt and pull these sticky ass tiny pieces of tar out of the bag with plastic sticking on them. The other really bad part of this is that it wastes the tar because it gets all spread out thin against the bag like a thick film of tar instead of being in a solid piece. 

Does anyone have ANY tips about how to salvage this tar and by some miracle get it to go back to an actual solid piece? I'm tryna bang this shit and it is making itself very difficult. Any thoughts?

Thanks, and be safe out there.

In fact, I knew it even before that. I spent many years just being fucking depressed, wanting to kill myself, and I'd see all these junkies downtown with even lesser lives than me, who somehow had found something to live for.

The memory of my first months as a heroin user gives me this extremely sad, excited and nostalgic feeling. It was the greatest time of my life. The high was still good as fuck. I still hung out with old friends, I had this awesome little secret to make me actually enjoy myself while out with them. I knew when I woke up hungover the next day, I could do a shot and feel awesome again. It was a magical time. 

A year ago I entered rehab after using for a year. In retrospect, it was a decent time. There's a funny phenomenon in the 3 rehabs I have been to; people kind of let their inner child out. There's no pressure of being a hard cunt, or a so called hard cunt. 

There's a very specific moment that I still remember vividly 1 year later. I had been clean for 2-3 weeks, finally got rid of the withdrawals. I walked into the kitchen and saw a bunch of ex-junkies dance around to some house music. I was like ""damn.. maybe sober happiness exist"".

Still, I left the rehab to kill myself. With no tolerance I got ahold of 0.4 g first and pushed off without any reluctance whatsoever. I was ready to die. Sadly I woke up. A few weeks later I did the same with 0.5. Woke up after 4 hours. I've needed narcan after only like 0.15 so that is fucking weird. I dunno why I haven't done a new and failsafe attempt yet. After an attempt, you do kinda see the value in life and get the willpower to keep trying. But there will be a third time.

Now I'm on Suboxone and I've never felt worse. It has robbed me of all my manliness, so to speak. I'm just a passive fuck who doesn't wanna do anything. I can't keep a boner. I have no interest in women, exercise or whatever. 

One day, that suicide-shot is gonna do the trick. And then I'll nod into eternity.

It contained 125mg of acetyl fentanyl, 25mg of fentanyl citrate, and 25mg of fentanyl HCL. That was all concentrated into one 20ml bottle and each spray was a fucking pack a punch from the depths of heaven (or should i say hell). But yeah I had to cold turkey and ended up getting pretty sick and going to the doc to which she said was a sinus infection so I didn't even think WD's (never had them before and have used oxy for a while). Got some 100mg acetyl fentanyl powder and turned it into a 15ml bottle solution with saline and went at it again. Lasted about 2 days..... thats when the WD's came. Now I did not leave one speck of fentanyl left in the bottle as I filled it back with saline 2-3 times. Anyways, it's been since Saturday and I still feel like fucking shit and haven't slept the past week and a half. Now I already have about 10 30mg roxy's but my question is, if I were to take a roxy or half, would the effects just reset my tolerance back to having bad as fuck withdrawals, or could I get away with taking a roxy every other day?

3coooo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3coooo/the_helicopter_bird/,33,https://redd.it/3coooo,morbo2000,The Helicopter Bird,"""So..."" asks Melo who stinks of sweat and beer,  ""it's not a hummingbird?""

""No!"" says Dev stamping her foot in the mud.  ""I don't think it has wings at all.  It wears a backpack that has a-""

""A helicopter bird?""

Stoned Melo is slow.  But forever nice.  He has been trying to get Dev to eat the veggie bagel a lady lawyer bought him downtown after he helped her carry in seventeen boxes of documents.

""Yes!  It has goggles and everything.  I have no idea how it steers so don't you dare ask!""  Dev huffs and walks around in a circle.  Every now and then Melo half halfheartedly offers Dev the bagel.

""I saw it again as we pulled in the park.  You were talking to Clayton and Billy Fives and YOU missed it Mr. Melo!  Rrrrr!""

Dev throws up her hands to the heavens.  She has a long day ahead of her after a slow start.  She turns around and snatches the bagel from her boyfriend who smiles in relief.  Now Melo can sit in the grass. The grasshopper stares at the green grass spreading out in all directions, up and down hills of yore.  Golden Gate Park is their home.  Melo sighs, content.

High above a redwood tree Dev spots it standing motionless in the sky. Her boyfriend has his eyes closed but by now Dev realizes the helicopter bird is just for her.  It's like watching a whale spout far at sea or a shooting comet.  By the time you point it out, it will have vanished.

""You want to follow me helicopter bird?"" asks Dev looking up at it.  A beautiful bird.  Like a shadow of blue in the moonlight and shiny like water.  ""Today is Tuesday bird.  On Tuesdays I worship the three towers to save the city.  Three!  Wanna come helicopter birdy?  Then FOLLOW me!"" commands Dev as she marches off.

""Hey!"" yells Melo from the grass, ""Your jacket.""

Dev looks around suspiciously.  Yes, the air and the sky whisper today shall be cold.  Her boyfriend is wise with Nature.

""'Ok!  Thanks honey!"" she chirps while pulling on her two sizes too big baggy, mountaineering parka.  She loves this jacket because she can disappear into it or use it as a sleeping bag.

Dev takes a seemingly random route using public transportation, well walked streets and unmarked alley paths.  But there is a method to the madness.  She follows her tags.  DevL is carved and painted all over. Dev meticulously checks each DevL tag for wear, damage or worse - vandalism.  She repairs, repaints and re-carves the tags as she traipses along.

The helicopter bird meets her the Dewey Monument in Union Square.  The goddess Nike dances on top a pillar of Roman glory while clutching her trident and wreath.  Dev reaches into her pocket and grabs a handful of dirt.

""Oh city, feel my vibration!"" she intones in an unnaturally loud and weird voice.  Dev's voice is girly childish but flat.  It lacks tone and emotion giving it an unsettling but hypnotic quality.  Tourists and office workers are compelled to stare and she addresses the 85 foot column, ""I stand at your heart!  This is the sacrifice of Earth!"" and Dev scatters the handful of dirt into the wind.

""What the fu-"" yells a man in a business suit eating a hot dog as dirt showers down on him and his lunch.

""Oops!  My bad!  But it's for our city sir!  That should keep the Drowned Boys away"" says Dev to the man who glares at his hot dog.

""Un-fucking-believable"" says the man shaking his head and walking away.  He throws the hot dog in the garbage and yells, ""Fucking hippy cunt!""

Dev comprehends humanity.  So she watches carefully.  A guy like that won't hit her.  A guy like that will find someone else to hit her. You have watch people.  They wear masks.  Like that creeper peeper in the park that asks girls to do rude things for money.  He looks so nice. But you could smell the dried cum and blood.  Moths live inside his grinning skull.  When he grabbed her arm the feeling of the grave was so strong she screamed.  And thank goodness the Lover and Jason were looking for Melo.  For the third time in her life, Dev enjoyed watching someone get beat up.  The Lover and the Vagabond changed the chapter and rewrote her Terrible Ending.  

So she owes them.  She owes everyone and everyone needs her.  This is Devika's burden.

The man is walking towards a cop.  He points to the dirt on his suit and points at Dev.  The helicopter bird transmits this. Dev nods and slips into the crowded square.  Sliding through people and watching the helicopter bird's thoughts.  The cops spread out looking for a short female white teen in a green parka.

""Sit!"" commands the bird helicopter.

Dev drops besides a concrete planter on the edge of the Union Square stairs and yanks the parka hood over her head.  The green parka moves left into the next world.  As moths become butterflies, Dev pops out on the right side of the world in an imperial purple parka. Cops walk by looking for green and ignore the purple caterpillar with the Steal Your Face logo stitched across the hood.

""Now!"" says the helicopter bird.

""Thanks!"" cries Dev as she breaks through the rift and emerges back to this world in green.  She sprints to the street just as a Muni bus appears.  In her pocket is a day pass and she holds it up.  The driver steps on the gas removing Dev from chaos.  They chug east.  Towards the great pyramid.

""Watcha ya listening to?"" asks Dev with her hands clasped politely behind her back.

The corner street preacher looks up and sighs.  So much for a peaceful lunch break.  He wipes his mouth with a napkin, puts his sandwich down and turns off his Walkman.  The spacey little homeless girl is back. Oh well.  Better than the damn police.

""Jazz.  John Coltrane.  Live recording from 1966...way before your time.  Reminds me how damn I old I got"" grins the preacher flashing his gold tooth.  ""You like music?""

""Yup.  All sorts for fun and dancing.  But Mozart is the best.  His gift to us is our treasure from the stars"" grins Dev.

""Yeah he's good"" agrees the street preacher who thinks he shouldn't ask but he does anyways, ""What do you mean by the stars?""

""Mozart is from the stars!  A spaceman.  That's why his music increases your spatial-temporal reasoning.  It was his gift.  I always listen to Mozart because I have a lot of stuff to think about.""

The street preacher smiles.  And people call him crazy.

""Hey, you want some of this roast beef sandwich?  Your friend with the pink hair made it"" says the corner street preacher offering the untouched half of his sandwich to Dev.

""Why does everybody keep trying to feed me?"" complains Dev rolling her eyes.

""Because soaking wet you'd be lucky to weigh 85 pounds!  Look, just eat the damn sandwich.""

Dev sticks her tongue out but then shyly reaches out and takes the food.  It does smell good.  Canon Cafe has the best sandwiches. Especially when Kym makes them because she sneaks in extra meat and cheese if she likes you.  Apparently she likes the street preacher because this is a huge sandwich.

""Ok but I hate owing people"" says Dev gnawing into the sandwich.

The street preacher hands her a napkin.  ""You don't owe me a thing girl.  This is mine to give and I gave it to you"" he says as he sits back and bites into his half.  ""But I know what you mean.  I'm the same way actually.  How about you tell me your name and we call it even?""

""Devika Liora.  But really I'm just a Dev.""

""Devika?  Now THAT is a beautiful name.  You know I worry about your tag, the DevL thing.  Some folks frown on that"" frowns the street preacher.  

Above his head to left, written in a Sharpie on the side of building is a little cursive DevL tag. 

Dev shrugs.  ""But I don't care who I help.  I love everyone.  I'm just like you but with more people and a much longer path to walk.""

The street preacher laughs.  ""Fair enough Devika.  My name is Reverend Archibald Jackson.  Or Archie.""

Dev suddenly leaps up and points at the sky.

""There it is Archie!"" shrieks Dev spraying sandwich bits.

""What?"" says Archie looking around.

""The helicopter bird!  By the Blockbuster billboard!""  points Dev.

""There's nothing there-""

""By the 'F' in 'No More Late Fees'!  See?!""

""Wait a helicopter bird?"" asks Archie looking at her as she hops up and down pointing at nothing.

""It's going to the great pyramid without me!"" says Dev running down the street.  Office workers and pedestrians move out of her way as the barefoot short, grungy little hippie girl in a green parka wails, ""Wait for me you dumb bird!""

The street preacher watches her run off and shakes his head.  He pulls out the last quarter inch of a burnt joint held together with a singed matchbook cover.  Archie lights it and expertly puffs in two hits before the joint evaporates to smoke and ash.  Helicopter bird...? Fucking drugs, he muses.

The Transamerica Pyramid is the tallest building in San Francisco and thus the Key to the Sky People.  Dev loses sight of the helicopter bird as it turns a corner but spots it hovering by the western face of the great pyramid.  Built for purposes of greed, Dev has been secretly transforming the pyramid into a tool for Righteousness.  And she knows she is watched here.  This is where she has been arrested.  She does not need the helicopter bird to tell her invisible powers guard the money.  But this is her job.  She must complete the Ritual.  The city and her loved ones are counting on her.

Man, I have worked this beat for three years.  Office workers are jaywalking, littering, pompous fools but their crimes are not the kind I can arrest them for.  So it's a pretty kick back spot.  Mostly pick pockets and loonies.

And speaking of loonies, here SHE comes again.  Little mouse.  The bleeder.  Sigh.  I loosen my cuffs and move around my car.  But then again...Lunch is coming up.  Steve and Ivan will relieve us in less than 20 minutes.  And it is a GOOD day for tacos.  I watch her pull out the knife, wince as she slices her arm and grips it for blood. Damn girl!  No expression on her doll face.  Here it comes.  Charlie looks at me and I shake my head.  Fuck it.  She's a harmless kook and two hours of stomach grumbling paperwork is a waste of tax payer money.

Oh and tacos man.  Dungeness crab tacos at La Fogata taqueria!

When she shrieks, ""Oh city feel my vibration!  I stand at your Vision!  This is the sacrifice of Sky!"" the pedestrians scramble to get out of her way.  The wind roars down the street.  When Dev's hair swirls into the air she shrieks and slaps her blood on the lobby window.  Then she sprints away as workers stare in disgust at the bloody handprint and mutter to themselves, What the fuck was that?

The helicopter bird sees her traipsing down the street like a tumbling leaf.  She is quick and knows the city's secrets.  Unseen, she rides on cable cars, slips through streams of pedestrians and into a BART station.  The helicopter bird can't go in there but knows where she's heading.

The Ferry Building clock tower strikes out the recorded gongs of a bell to tell the people it is now 5:30 pm.  Dev sprints madly towards it.  The sun still shines but people are already preparing for the sunset.  Dev wants to finish her ritual now because being late is rude.  These are very old spirits we are talking about.

Tourists watch the tiny girl in the huge green coat stand before the clock tower.  In her hand (which appears to be bloody) she holds a bottle of water.  She lifts her arms to the tower and yells, ""Oh city feel my vibration!  I stand at your Soul!  This is the sacrifice of Water!""

She shakes the bottle spraying water everywhere.  A dismayed old Japanese tourist shields herself and stumbles out of the way.  The seagulls go mad.  The sky fills with them instantly and Dev drops to her knees in thanks.  The helicopter bird hovers above her in the cloud of seagulls undetected by all except Dev.

""Hey!  You!  Out of here!  Now!"" bellows a man.  Dev looks up and see's a security guard bearing down on her.  But she is spent.  The last offering sucked out her soul and it mingles in a cloud of birds.  She silently implores the helicopter bird for help.

""Please.  I am so tired.  Let me rest"" she says weakly as the man stands there and barks into a walkie talkie.

""Yo!  What's the problem Billy?"" demands an angry and familiar voice.

Dev looks up and smiles relieved.  It's the Lover.  Khadja.  The helicopter bird swirls down gently and breathes Dev's soul back into her mouth.

""Ahhhh!  Yummy yum thanks!"", says Dev.  The security guard and Kym both look at her for second.  Then they get back to the real world.

""It's a disturbance radioed in Kym"" says the security guard.

Like the other security guards trapped into walking the Ferry Building for 8 hour shifts, Billy enjoys seeing Kym.  The girl with the pink hair and tight, half shirts always makes the day brighter.

""That's my friend Dev.  She's ok"" explains Kym.

""Hi Lover!"" says Dev.

Kym looks down at her and frowns.  ""Devika, it's weird enough when you call my boyfriend that.""

""Oh.  Sorry Khadja.""

""Well it was radioed in so I have to report it-""

""Look Billy, I had to do a double today.  I worked Union Square for the AM rush and had to fill in the afternoon slot here.  I am so fucking tired!  I'm too tired to ask nicely.  Fuck the report!""

""Easy Kym!"" says Billy as he puffs himself up.  ""This is a Code 16. Your friend is throwing water on people.  I have to escort her off premises and call the cops.""

""A Code what?"" yawns Dev.

""The fuck you are!"" says Kym pointing a lit cigarette at the security guard.  ""I'll talk to Tim and get your ass busted for smoking weed on your break!""

""But...I smoked it with you"" says Billy hurt.

""Fuck!"" says Kym rolling her eyes, ""I like you and I give you coffee so don't get all Nazi on us ok?""

""Alright.  I'm sorry.  Just get her out of here ok?  People are complaining"" says Billy looking around.

Kym stares at the security guard until he shuffles off awkwardly. Then she helps up Dev.

""Aww Khadj you squished his ego.""

""Fucking security guys"" says Kym shaking her head.  Then she looks at Dev.  ""Hmmm.  Let me guess.  Your soul is loose.  Somewhere!""

""No.  I got it back.  Helicopter bird.""

""Helicopter bird?  I was close.  You hungry Devika?""

At the exchange, I can get 0.22¬µm wheel filters. I was always under the impression that 0.22¬µm filters filter out bacteria. The last few times I have been to the exchange, I have asked different employees if these do in fact filter out bacteria. I have had answers ranging from duhhh I don't know, to no they don't filter bacteria.

So the last time I went I asked again and said that everything I have read on the internet points to 0.22¬µm filters being able to filter out bacteria. The guy (this was at least the second time I have asked him) said that these particular 0.22¬µm filter do not filter bacteria, but there are 0.22¬µm ones that do, they just don't order those ones in. 

I'm not understanding how one 0.22¬µm filter could filter bacteria, but another can't. What would be the difference?

I'm only filtering heroin but I would prefer to do it the safest way practically possible. ",1436445158.0

**Chapter 3**

Walking through the doors of my new school, I am as nervous as a man on trial. It is a private school, and one of my choosing, but the student body numbers perhaps one-hundred, and I will immediately be noticed as the new kid. This is my one shot, however, and I refuse to blow it. A condition of my release from the hospital was that I no longer be kept out of school. I had a bargaining chip, and I took it. Rocky Mountain Academy has a reputation for sending kids to good colleges, and flowing heavy with drug supplies. So here I am, entering the first day of tenth grade for the second time.

As I walk into my chemistry class, I am tense. I feel it in my muscles, like a deer sensing a pack of predators. Already I feel out of place in my cargo shorts and Hollister tee. Why did I wear this? First period is chemistry. The people in this room have a sense of camaraderie. They have known each other for nearly their entire lives. I am acutely aware of my status as an interloper. But they have not made up their minds yet. I am in a state of quantum superpositioning, both someone they like and dislike. One wrong move, and they will ostracize me.

A single boy stands out from the herd. His shaggy hair, baggy jeans, and Bob Marley hoodie suggest that he views himself as an outsider, too, and wraps his identity up in his drug use. He looks at me, and noticing my nervousness, beckons toward an open seat next to him. Smiling, I sit down clumsily and introduce myself. He tells me his name.

‚ÄúWelcome, man. I‚Äôm Jacob.‚Äù he says warmly. He has a comforting presence, and seems wiser than his age might suggest. Already, I hope to become friends with him. But now the teacher has begun the lecture, and that will have to wait.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

It is P.E. sometime during the first week. Jacob mentions something about weed to me while we sit on the bench. He is fishing for hints that I might share his habits. Enthusiastically, I tell him, ‚ÄúYeah, dude. I totally smoke.‚Äù Ugh, I sound like a complete tool. He takes no notice. Now he is the one talking to me, and not me to him. 

‚ÄúWhere can I score around here?‚Äù I ask as nonchalantly as possible. Broaching the subject of opiates would be premature right now.

‚ÄúAsk Daniel.‚Äù he replies, pointing across the gym to a tall, skinny senior with long blonde hair and a baja. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll hook it up.‚Äù

Hooking it up means paying twenty dollars for what I can only estimate to be two grams of mid-grade bud. I buy it gratefully, trying to hide my desperation to get high on something. Should I ask this kid if he knows where to find roxies? No, too risky, I tell myself. He might stop selling to me altogether. 

‚ÄúCome over to my house after school, man. We‚Äôll smoke up.‚Äù Jacob says during our free period. 

‚ÄúFor sure!‚Äù I try unsuccessfully to mask my enthusiasm.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Jacob‚Äôs basement is a shrine dedicated to the worship of all things marijuana. Colorful posters adorn the walls, and paraphernalia litters the desk and coffee table. I sit down on the couch. Whipping out a two foot bong, Jacob loads a bowl from some of the finest nugs I have seen. Before long, I am higher than I have ever been in my short pot smoking career.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the thing about our school, man. Everyone fucking sucks.‚Äù declares Jacob as he blows out a thick cloud. ‚ÄúYou might not see it yet, but you will... in time. They‚Äôre complete fucking pussies. They don‚Äôt get it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey seem nice enough to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve only been here one day. Wait until they find out you smoke pot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, mainly I‚Äôm a pillhead.‚Äù I remark sardonically.

‚ÄúPills? These kids will eat you alive when they figure that out!‚Äù

My phone rings, cutting through the now hotboxed room. I answer reluctantly.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my mom, dude. She wants me home now.‚Äù

As I walk home, I become aware of just how high I am. Paranoia creeps up into my consciousness, strangling my thoughts. Approaching my house, I see my mom standing in the doorway. She is generally upset with me, but today she looks downright livid. Fuck. She must suspect something. Try to play it off. She refuses to give me the chance. 

‚ÄúLet me smell your breath.‚Äù she insists. I have no choice but to take the risk.

Before I can come up with an excuse, I find myself the recipient of a virulent tirade. Worthless, loser, mistake: these are merely a few pejoratives I find directed at me. Who cares? I deal with this talk sober all the time. Now she wants to test me for marijuana on a weekly basis. I tell her to go ahead. Inside I know God wants me to feel his embrace once more. Opiates were always the way to go.

She calls Jacob‚Äôs parents, and he is mad at me for a few days before we return to business as usual. He directs me to a local kid who sells 30mg roxies, and I pick a few up. The familiar feeling comes back to greet me like an old friend as I sink into my first nod in several months. Like coming home, coming home, home, home...

Chapter 4

A benzo high is a treacherous opponent, sneaky in the way it coaxes the mind into letting down its guard. Never trust a benzo. It takes victims by surprise, altering memories and warping reality to fit its needs. Other drugs are straightforward in their effects. You are acutely aware that you are nodding out, stoned, or tripping. Not so with the benzodiazepine. The hallmark of any decently strong benzo is that the more one takes, the less one is aware that they are under the influence of a mind-altering substance.

---------------------------------------------------------------

‚ÄúHave you ever done benzos dude?‚Äù Jacob asks me. We sit on the curb  in the neighborhood smoke spot. Denver is full of such crevices, always populated by at least a few teens trying to get their buzz on. We pay no attention to the law these days. Legalization is on the horizon, probably in the next few years. We can sense it in our endocannabinoid system.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a benzo?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda like being drunk without the goggles. Nice mellow high.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you have?‚Äù

‚ÄúK-pins.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôve heard of those.‚Äù I haven‚Äôt.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm selling them for two bucks a pop.‚Äù Jacob has been paying more attention to pharmaceuticals since I introduced him to opiates.

‚ÄúDamn bro, I‚Äôll take ten.‚Äù My experience buying oxys has jaded my notions of what a pill should cost.

Jacob hands them over, tiny and orange. I immediately take 2. My house is five minutes away, but by the time I walk in the door, I am feeling pleasantly calm. The high is soothing, but nothing compared to the all-encompassing embrace of a nod. For now, it seems fine. Time will tell whether I shell out money for more of these. I sit in my bedroom, locked to the bed by this chemical force of nature, mind vacant. Soon enough, though, the high wears off, and I am left feeling tired and unimpressed. Fuck it, I think. These aren‚Äôt shit. I could do these anytime. It is a dangerous conclusion, but sooner or later, some lessons must be learned the hard way. Sticking the devious little things in my backpack, I crawl into bed and pass out gently.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm gonna do some during this period.‚Äù I say as the bell rings and we pack away our notebooks.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably do one with you, man.‚Äù Jacob responds nonchalantly. We head into the bathroom furtively, and the deed is done. True to his word, Jacob eats a single pill. I eat four. We head to our next class, glad to have a way to ignore it. 

Nearly twenty minutes later, I begin to wonder why it is that I feel nothing. Stumbling out of my seat, I mumble some excuse to my teacher and wobble toward the door. Why is it not working yet? The hallway warps around me as I careen toward the bathroom. These must be especially weak. I‚Äôll just pop a few more. Slurping some water from the faucet, I toss another three harmless looking pills into my mouth.

Spanish class is when I begin to think I may have been given duds. God, this class is hilarious. I can‚Äôt stop laughing for the life of me. Why is everyone staring at me? Can‚Äôt they see how funny this is? My fit stops as I topple from my chair and hit the ground. Sitting back down, I think to myself that I have to tell Jacob these pills are no good. The teacher is yelling at me. What does he want?

‚ÄúCome sit up next to me until you can behave yourself.‚Äù I‚Äôm laughing again now, but I do as he says and contain myself until the bell rings.

English class. We have a quiz today. I hate this teacher. She is a menopausal, uptight bitch... Shit, did I say that out loud? No, no, of course I didn‚Äôt. Why is this quiz written in such a confusing manner. I raise my hand to ask a question.

‚ÄúWhy are you yelling?‚Äù the kid in the seat next to me asks.

‚ÄúWhy indeed, Mr. Mostlysapien?‚Äù this blonde gargoyle of a woman asks in a shocked tone of voice.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not yelling.‚Äù I respond.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still doing it!‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù I whisper. Several people give me strange looks, as though I‚Äôd just committed some terrible indecency, and the quiz resumes as normal.

As the final bell rings, I stumble toward the car. Mom asks me how my day was. I tell her it was fine. She looks at me with a raised eyebrow, but I put my headphones on and press play on my iPod. The drive home is uneventful. I‚Äôm very happy.

Climbing up the stairs to my room as I arrive home, I slip and fall down the whole flight of them. It doesn‚Äôt hurt at all. I must have been lucky. The floor feels nice. I decide to lay there for a few minutes, giggling. Then I head up to my room. A few minutes later, a knock sounds at my door, and Mom walks in, looking concerned.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with you? Are you on something?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No, of course not!‚Äù I snicker. That‚Äôs a funny thing to ask me.

‚ÄúTell me right now if you‚Äôre on drugs, Mostlysapien!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm... Not. Not on anything.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy are you slurring your words and taking so long to respond to me?!‚Äù

She says more words. I say more words. She leaves the room. I sit there, slowly coming to terms with the horrifying notion that perhaps those Klonopin worked a great deal more than I thought. The minutes pass by as I try to figure out what is happening.

There is a much firmer knock on the door, and a voice from outside.

‚ÄúCan I come in, man.‚Äù a husky baritone sounds muffled through the door. It is my brother, John. In his mid-thirties, John is related to me through the same mother, but he is far older. Having had more than his fair share of drug experiences at my age, it makes sense that Mom would have called him over. Recently, he moved into the same apartment complex as us, working odd jobs, so he took no time in heading over. Standing six and a half feet tall, and built like a refrigerator, he is an imposing presence in the room.

‚ÄúTell me what‚Äôs going on, bro. I‚Äôve been around the block a few times. I understand, don‚Äôt worry.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to tell you.‚Äù I‚Äôm panicking. Can I trust him? Mom asked him over. Will he tell her?

‚ÄúI promise I won‚Äôt tell Mom.‚Äù he assures me, as though reading my mind.

I sigh, ‚ÄúI took a lot of klonopin.‚Äù

The door slams open and in walks my mom. She has a look on her face that I never wish to see again. This is more than anger. This is pure rage.

‚ÄúHow fucking dare you, you little piece of shit! Doing drugs at school?! You are never going to leave this house again!‚Äù 

‚ÄúMom! Mom, calm down!‚Äù my brother pleads. She continues her rant, and I make a break for the door. If I can get out of the house, go somewhere and come down, I‚Äôll be fine, I tell myself. Noticing my move, Mom blocks the door. Dad has heard the noise by now, and he‚Äôs in the doorway too, looking like a deer in the headlights. I am trapped, caged like an animal. No escape. 

My body is in fight-or-flight mode now. My eyes skip toward the large window behind me. Can I make the drop? No one expects me to try. Crossing the room in a stride, I thrust my elbow into the windowpane, shattering it. John lunges for me. There‚Äôs not enough time to get out. Fight it is, then. Ducking John, I clutch the largest, most dagger-like fragment of glass from the ground. My brother bounced at clubs for years, and stands a full foot over me. Even sober, he could disarm me without breaking a sweat. As I swipe at him menacingly with my shiv, he twists it from my wrist and tackles me to the ground, bringing his full weight to bear on my chest. Unexpectedly, however, the benzo high has given me an advantage in this fight: I am impervious to pain. Adrenaline shoots through my body, and feeling like a very small Hulk, I simply lift John off of me and resume my flight toward the door. He grabs me again, this time putting me in a bear hug as he pins me to the floor. I lift him off again as though he were a sack of potatoes. 

Suddenly, another body joins the fray. Pete is our next door neighbor. Dark skinned, and slightly bigger than John, my parents have had time to run next door and tell him it is an emergency. He pins one of my arms as John pins the other. Completely insane now, I slide out from underneath the both of them, shoving John against the wall. He comes back at me, insisting that he only wants to help me in as loud and calm a voice as he can muster. I scream primally, fully transformed into a savage and unnatural creature.

Dad‚Äôs voice drifts through the yelling and grunting: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs upstairs.‚Äù

Pete is forced backward once more, and as I rise once again I feel an intense pain radiating throughout my body, accompanied by a white noise in my eardrums that drowns out all other sound. As I collapse to the ground, I make out the discharged taser gun stretching from my neck to the uniformed police officer at the entrance of my room. Then the lights turn off.",1436434388.0

Also if you do not consider yourself addicted, how long have you been using, and what is your ROA? What do you think has kept you from addiction?

I have been using heroin for probably around 3 years. In this time I have changed my ROA from snorting to injecting. I have had periods where I haven't used for months. I have had periods where I have used every day for a week, then a few days off, and then back to it daily again. I haven't had money lately, so I really can't afford to use.

Since I have been injecting, I have been through the lowest point in my life. My relationship ended with the girl I thought would be the mother to my kids, we were engaged. I have lost someone close from an OD. I have lost all of my friends. I know this will sound stupid, but it was all unrelated to the heroin use. 

At my lowest point, I was using more heavily (for my standards). I still have never experienced a withdrawal, and I am not addicted. I still have something inside of me that will not let myself become addicted. I have been through the worst part of my life, and have come out with no addiction much to my own surprise. When I broke up with my first girlfriend I found myself with a nice little Xanax habit, but this time, I was using heroin, so I thought I would spiral downwards just like I did with Xanax.

Getting through this tough time and coming out with no addiction kind of empowers me. It makes me feel like if I have the willpower now, then I can keep using without getting addicted. Don't get me wrong, I do think about it a lot, I just try hard to not use all the time.

Maybe I'm naive.",1436432885.0

I was in an aol chat room. I must've been about twelve or something. I thought it would be it would be a good idea to tell everyone that I was a rapist and some other vile shit.

I don't know exactly why I'm doing it. I guess I just wanted to talk to people who have an idea of where I'm at. I don't have as bad of a habit as a lot of people, but about 2 years ago I was doing 150mg of oxy every day for about 2 or 3 months. I came out of that by kicking cold turkey. A month and a half ago I started up taking roxies again, starting slow, figuring that I'd never get to the same point. I ran up CC debt and spent most of my $, until finally I decided to go to a suboxone clinic. I don't want to say it was shady, but literally all I had to do to get a script was to pay (cash only), and pass a urine test for opiates. I've been on anywhere between 90-210mg of oxy a day for this last month. The dr suggested I take anywhere from half a strip twice a day to a full strip twice a day. I've been taking small pieces of the strip, just enough to not make me feel like shit. I know it may not be recommended to go against drs orders, but I dont want to end up trading an oxycodone addiction for a suboxone addiction. I'm able to avoid wd symptoms at around 1mg per day (.5 in the am and .5 to help me get some sleep). I don't really care if the dr ends up dropping me, he wrote me a script for 18 strips, which seems more than enough to taper me down. I was just wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience. If I keep taking the minimal amount of suboxone to let me function, while dropping the amount over time, is this something I can use to avoid a bad withdrawal? I work M-F, should I try to figure it so that I drop to a low enough level on a friday and deal with not taking anything through the weekend? My last oxy was on sunday night. Since then, I've only taken about 2 subs total. Maybe 1 and a half over monday and monday night, which i took too early an sent me into PAWS, which I really, really have to recommend against, then i split up the rest of the half until tuesday. Today I've taken maybe 1/8th of a strip, split between 5am and 8pm. 

I don't have an exact taper plan, but I know I don't want to be taking a strip per day. I'm not trading one addiction for another.

I wouldn't feel nearly as good as if I had waited, but that was entirely my fault. First it was a 4mg here, 8mg there, then half the loot and now here I am, staring at what I promised myself would be my returning home treat along with the rigs I ordered in the mail. Here's how I justified injecting that last half: if I was going to be forced to get clean anywho I may as well not have any when I get back so I don't restart this cycle I'm breaking. But who am I am kidding, I'm currently constantly thinking about hitting my boy up as soon as I get back, in just two short (incredibly long) weeks. 

Even now, after the first leg of my flight not even 24 hours after my last shot I feel the sickness. I prepared though, for before leaving my house 1mg of klonopin was in my belly, a pot brownie, whiskey sour, and some Imodium along with ibuprofen. It helped, but most has worn off by now, and that fucking crawly skinned, sweat slicked poop city feeling is always on my shoulder, laughing at me. I'm lucky hydromorphone withdrawals go fast compared to the others. 

So here I am siting dopesick with my oblivious mother, stepfather and little brother waiting for my next connecting flight and I know we will all get along and have a good time. I know I'll feel good at the end of this , but right now I'd rather be high.

Early 20's i peaked a health problem related to epilepsy that's still not diagnosed (LEAD TO HUGE DEPRESSION) Going desperate i started drinking, for a year too much, after that even more and i became an alcoholic. Fast forward 1 year and after hell i quit. But i was still auto destructive. I got a source for Dilaudid and taught myself how to shoot it, i always did it alone. I got it through dark net roads (silkroad), i even tried Heroin. 

Last time i too dilaudid i was going through it fast like as usual when i suddenly thought ""wtf am i doing with my life..."" I used the remainder to slowly tamper off and started planing a better life. Dillies ended and it hurt a bit (i wasn't really a junkie, alcohol was my choice always). I got Subutex (2mg not much) from my doctor, felt better, i got motivation, got in the gym, started eating healthy.

The problem is i only do this because of subutex energy (btw i break it and snort only because sublingual is a waste, u get more in your body and feel less). I lost all libido with Subutex so getting a girl is out of option. I want to be better, i want to be clean, but i'm stuck, if i stop depression will return, if i keep it my dick won't work and another side effects that suck. Regards bros.",1436378238.0

A couple months back, i was trying to quit dope and I heard that doing acid was an eye opening  experience for people. It made them ""see the world differently and better and made them quit dope"". Well that shit didn't work for me. I have depression. it was the reason i started doing opiates in the first place. I feel the acid use made shit worse. I feel like it changed me and my personality and i pretty much forgot who i was before it. I feel like i cant relate with anyone, especially my friends and loved ones and shit. At this point im thinking about injecting a shit load of dope and basically ending this ride we call life. If anyone has experience doing acid and have felt like this, let me know if it gets better or not. it even ruined weed for me. I'm pretty sure it brought on depersonalization (look it up if you dont know what it is) which is a dissociative disorder. I know some of you might think this is the normal depression that comes with opiate use but i know this is different. If shit dont get better, ima ride out these last few weeks high as fuck, and then shoot up and die. Ive never shot more than 2 bags before, so i'm sure it would work.

I had issues getting proper pain management almost out of the gate, but I finally got in somewhere and had my first appointment today.  It didn't go as well as I had hoped but it wasn't a complete disaster.  I got sent home with a script for 60 Norco 10s.  My issue is that the doctor wrote the dosage for two a day, which is super low for what I'm dealing with.  My last script was for four a day and that was barely enough to take care of the pain when I would be doing nothing but laying in one spot.  I want to start going back to work and need to start doing some more intensive stuff with physical therapy to get my leg back in working condition, but there's no way this dosage is going to manage the pain.  I tried going back to work for a night three weeks ago when I still bad a script for 8-12 a day and I only made it three hours before I had to stop.

Now I know the game this doctor is trying to play.  I got scheduled for all kinds of testing today.  MRIs, EKG,  nerve tests, a fucking 24 hour EEG that I actually laughed at when the receptionist told me I needed to schedule a date for.  I know what's wrong with me.  I have specialists for my neck and my leg and the general physical trauma.  There's nothing they're going to diagnose me with that I'm not already diagnosed for.  But this doctor is a jew, literally.  He was wearing a yarmakule when I saw him.  At one time this guy had a very promising career ahead of him.  He's a brit that got his PhD at a very prestigious university in England (I want to say Oxford but I can't remember).  He was on the medical staff at Harvard in the 80s when he got busted by the DEA for selling prescriptions of percosets and shit under the table and on the street.  He got fired from Harvard and had his license suspended until something like 1996.  Now he's running around the Midwest in a private practice out of decrepit office buildinge serving a bunch of trailer trash scripts for phantom back pain.  Talk about a fall from grace.

From what I had researched online and the vibes I got today, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have even got a script for these Norcos today if I wasn't all visibly fucked up.  This dude has a bunch of equipment and he's going to make damn sure he's going to use it on everybody who comes through his door.  He is 100% running a business, and I don't even really have a problem with that.  My issue is that he gave me a super low dose to start out with.  This won't even comfortably get me through most days when I'm just sitting around, it's definitely not going to get me through an 8 hour shift at work.  And I need to start drawing checks again.

So here's my question.  If I were to call the pain management clinic after the weekend and ask if I could up the dosage to 4 a day, would that fly?  I have another appointment on the 23rd.  I don't want to just start taking all these and then get fucked over for not still having them.in two weeks.  I understand this dude wants you to run through his gambit and charge your insurance for 20 grand before he goes and writes you real scripts, but I'm not there for a diagnosis
  They have all my medical records already.  Everybody knows I'm in pain and I need to be there.  I want to be able to go back to work but I don't want to fuck myself over by appearing to be a drug addict because I called in between appointments and asked if I could up my dose to the last script I had.  Do you think I could do it or should I just wait to go back and then tell him the dosage is too low and hope he ups it?  And should I have the exact count for the script in two weeks or should.i just take as many as I reasonably need and then tell him I'm low and need something else?  This is my first rodeo with pain management, I have no idea what the proper way to handle this is.  Any input would be appreciated.",1436543120.0

I'm a two month veteran of the site only, but I've tried to be helpful as much as possible because I'm a 56 year old private nurse.  Also, I've been a junkie all this time with very little breaks, currently to Roxanol (liquid morphine) and Percocet.  I also smoke tons of weed and take benzos and any speed and/or sleeping pills I can get my hands on.  I NEVER steal from patients, even if they die and they don't need the meds anymore.  I'm in charge of destroying old or unwanted meds and just put on the paperwork that I destroyed them per protocol, but keep them.

My girlfriend did the same thing and was a nurse too, but in an unrelated way she developed pancreatitis (which is a very deadly disease though she did not drink - you really can't when you have pancreatitis).  She had bouts for the last six years, actually had defeated uterine cancer, but this time the pancreatitis killed her.  It just dissolved away her whole pancreas and no one can live without a pancreas and no doctor can do anything about it like transplant a new one.  Possibly and maybe the drug taking precipitated it this time, but I told the doctors the truth and they said they really doubt it did.  Of course, I didn't mention that I took drugs.

So, that's the story and I have no intention of leaving this site, as it gives me so much comfort.  You guys are all super great.  If you can, say a prayer for Credditsdue's girlfriend's soul.

I gotta learn not to give a fuck. how does one achieve a state of not giving a fuck other than being gonzo high all the time??? anyways. isn't BPD where you feel like any small negative thing your SO says makes you feel like you are being abandoned for good. that's what it feels like for me. if a love interest gets mad at me that's it. its over. if I cant salvage it right away I cancel the relationship, no matter how far along in its tracks it is. done done boom. I cant stand thinking ive done something to ""spoil"" the potential love by being too needy and now shes mad at me. and even though she says she isn't mad shes at least annoyed. and bleh. its over. 

take it from me. its much easier and safer fucking and not loving. don't love these hos. let me put it this way. imagine being in a fairly normal relationship. you two argue at the rate of a relatively normal couple, whatever that is. I have no idea what that is but id say like maybe once every few weeks you have an argument or disagreement where you accidently hurt her and she in turn says something to hurt you back or  once in a blue moon packs her stuff and leaves for a night to stay at her moms for just a night to cool off. its a relatively minor thing. any normal person can see that shes not leaving for good, this is normal, people fight, they work things out. some couples never fight and some couples fight all the time. doesn't mean that they aren't happy and loving. but imagine feeling like every time shes mad at you then goes silent or packs her shit, that's it in your mind. the relationship Is over. you'll only say thing from a place of desperation to even further push her away. imagine going through that every fucking time you feel a slight rejection. its horrible. to me it feels like she is over me, she has no loving feeling for me anymore and im just a burden she has to deal with. its a shit way to live and I cant handle it much more . 

for you armchair psychoanalysts out there I think, no, I know, this stems from my mom telling us when we were kids that she was going to leave and go back to her parents overseas. that scared the crap out of me so bad. its the number one thing I feared In my entire life, coming home and my mom was going to be gone.

I'm the kind of person who *actually* owns micron filters instead of just talking about them. I'm not insulting anyone there or implying it's anything except for **good** to spread the word about micron filters, but let's face it, even though a lot of us think it'd be a nice idea or a luxury it's rather rare to actually buy them.

But to give myself a nice little treat because these gems finally came in: 

* [sterile vials](http://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/glass-vials-accessories/sealed-sterile-vials/clear-2-ml-5-ml/5ml-clear-sealed-sterile-glass-vials-blue.html) for storing my micron filtered bacteriostatic drugs

* [PES 0.2micron wheel filters](http://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/filtration/syringe-filters/gvs-abluo-25mm-sterile-pes-syringe-filter-0-2um-pore-size.html) 

* And [Benzyl Alcohol](http://www.medical-and-lab-supplies.com/chemicals-solvents/benzyl-alcohol-usp.html)- a bacteriostatic to stop bacteria from growing if they contaminate my vials

I decided that I'd buy [this milligram scale](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ESHDGOI) that is accurate to 20 ¬± 0.001g (i.e. weighs up to 20g, and has milligram precision through its whole range) for $25.21, although [a competitor](http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-GEMINI-20-Portable-MilliGram/dp/B0012TDNAM) apparently has been verified by the reviewers to be slightly more accurate (and it's only $22.20), but the weigh scale and wind-top (yes, you actually have to close the pastic bubble-top to weigh because even a breeze can fudge up the measurements!) were much more suitable to weighing drugs than the more accurate scale.

I also tend to miss my shots a lot because I'm an amphetamine user - how else would I make it through all of these college classes, let alone write ten-thousand character reddit posts for you every other day? - so my tips will sometimes go dull before I deposit the dope in a vein.  I usually get my needle in in the first 1-3 shots, but between tweaking or just being cold, everyone's had a day where they miss 10+ times, (sometimes you just slip out of a vein after taking 3-5 attempts, then you need 3-5 more to get in again) and you either have to keep using a dull needle, or waste all that time transferring the shots *and lose dope to your cotton in the process*.  This brought me to remember seeing someone actually using a slip-tip insulin syringe.  ""Wow!"" I thought, ""Why did I ever write off leur lock and slip tips just because I only ever saw them on 6cc barrels?""  Thus came the idea to purchase two boxes of [30g x 1/2"" luer lock needles](http://www.ebay.com/itm/121386350240) in spite of my preference for 31g x 5/16"" x 0.5cc insulin syringes. So now I'd be able to change my needle tip every other time I missed a shot and keep my veins much healthier. But that meant I needed a luer lock syringe.  I thought about just buying a hundred plastic 0.5cc or 1cc ones, but then I had the stunning idea to go with a modern twist the fancy styles they had in the 1800s, [a glass luer lock syringe barrel](http://www.ebay.com/itm/181501372061) to go with my luer lock needles.  

I'm quite curious to see how these turn out for use; it sure would be fucking fancy drawing a shot of sterile, filtered, bacteriostatic heroin solution from a self-sealing rubber-top borosilicate glass vial and into my glass reuseable syringe with a changeable 30gx1/2"" tip on the end.

And since I just got my last paycheck and quit my job to go back to college after being suspended for a year for massively overdosing in my dorm room, I was in the mood for splurging and rewarding myself for my efforts at pretending to be sober to campus administration and bought [a real vintage glass syringe](http://www.ebay.com/itm/1-pcs-2CC-Vintage-Glass-Syringe-2ml/151737767673) that I probably won't actually inject with because *jesus fucking christ that tip is like 2 inches long*, your syringe would be so far away from the vein you couldn't rest your hand, let alone employ fine movements! Lastly, who could resist [one of these syringes](http://www.ebay.com/itm/271423814027), like it was straight out of a movie, as close to the 1800s depiction as you could possibly get lol.  I plan to use this last one to fill my sterile vials with stock solution, since you need either a luer lock or a luer slip to use the micron filter, and then you also need a 5-10cc syringe to fill the vial up all the way (depending on what size you got) because otherwise you'd have to use your 1cc insulin syringe like 6-8 times (to be safe you wouldn't want to fill it up all the way to 1cc, probably just 60-80 units because the plunger's about to fall out and waste your dope on the floor).

All in all I spent $125, about $45 on toys (big metal-glass syringe in the last link, collectable vintage syringe in the second to last link, and my 20g x 1mg accuracy scale, though that could be considered HR since I'd be able to get my solutions accurate to mg/mL and my doses precise to the mg) and $80 on HR (10-pack wheel filters, needle tips, luer lock syringe for the tips, benzyl alcohol, propylene glycol, and gamma-radiation sterilized self-sealing rubber topped borosilicate glass vials), but I think it was a good present to myself.

For the price of a gram I was able to ensure that when I shoot pills there will be no microcrystalline cellulose and talc powder which, if they don't block peripheral capillaries and cut off blood flow to certain body parts or even cause a central blockage, will eventually collect in your lungs and slowly impede your ability breathe and oxygenate/decarboxylate your blood, and potentially the microcellulose crystals can cause cancer the same way asbestos shards/fibers can. I was also able to ensure that there will be no bacteria in my filtered drugs, and that none grow in it, nor will there be any impurities bigger than 0.2¬µm entering my blood, and when I do shoot, my veins will be healthier because there's less gross shit being shot into them, and they'll be punctured by sharp points.  Plus, with the glass vials - think about all the dope you lose to your cottons and time lost to prepping, and about how much time it takes to prep a shot.  I didn't realize until my parents started constantly banging on my bathroom door demanding to know why I was taking so long, but fuck, it takes 5-10 minutes to prep a pill, and 5 minutes to prep a shot of dope even though it only seems like 30-60 seconds.  With a sterile vial, you just stick the vial, draw, and shoot, and if you shoot fast enough, you won't even have to lie about needing to poop - ""Oh I'm going to go pee real quick brb"" -shoots up- ""Hey I'm back guys!"".

Do you actually get enough to get high every day? Even if it's a mild buzz? 

Do you have to go every single day, and if so, how long till you can get take home doses? How does that work?

How does methadone feel V's being on subs? Seems like each time I go back on subs I don't get quite as well. 

Do you have to submit to regular Drug tests? If so, how often? One thing I like about the subs is no tests. 

How much does it cost on average? Start up costs, daily dose costs, what if you don't have the cost one day?  

How does going on vacation work?  Or is that out of the question?  ",1436500287.0

Well today I was informed, by my loving grandmother, that a police officer came into her store asking about me, and other local junkies with whom I take care of. The officer told my grandma that one of our H addicts has been arrested and is headed for prison, and is dropping names left and right. My name being one mentioned. The officer told my grandma that I am being ""watched"" and that I need to cut this shit out... All because someone had to snitch.


Dealing is currently my only source of income as I was laid off in January and cannot get back on until the marijuana is out of my hair follicles. 


Why the fuck do people have to be such pieces of shit? People that beg me for shit, and I take care of even when they don't have any money? 


Not trying to be a dickhead, but this is the reason why I will never do heroin. People change when they get the hooks on that shit. They do the dumbest low shit for money like robbing houses. People that I was at one time friends with. 


Idk. I just cannot stand when I am good to people only to be turned on in the end. 


Rant over, and my apologies to those Heroin junkies that can keep it together.


Peace.

She called the pharmacy and pretended she was her doctor and called in a script for Norco 10/325 lol and just made up a DEA number.

Hi reddit, I am a long time lurker of this sub, long time opiate user, ranging from full blown daily dependence to chipping. 

I had an unintentional overdose in March of this year as a result of a fentanyl cut bag, was totally unaware I was over the line and was found laying outside in the snow without any clothes on. The temperature drop actually helped save me and I spent 14 days in ICU because I couldn't remember my name afterwards. 

As a result, I agreed to use vivitrol. I got my first shot on April first, and continued to get the shot every 27 days, with my last shot being may 29th. 

On July 2nd I decided I didn't want to use the shot anymore because quite frankly I am not entirely ready to stop. The break was well needed and used for the first time since March last Friday the 3rd. When I used on the 3rd, it had been 35 days since my last shot. I felt absolutely nothing. 

I continued to try to use until last night and last night I felt a very mild rush and minimal euphoria. This morning I used and finally got that rush i have been waiting to get, 43 days after my last vivitrol injection. 

It is definitely not a 28 day shot in my case. But I am so happy that I could finally blast off into blissful euphoria that most of us know and love. I am sure that the next following days will be just as blissful of not more, because I feel I'm only at about 80%.

I hope this post finds you happy and jolly, whether you're clean or nice and fucked up. Anyway, I thought I'd recap my dope experience today because it was kinda crazy. 

So I hit up my middle man this afternoon. Let's call him BD. He has a habit of being reeeaaaal fuckin' slow unless you tell him you're in a hurry. So I tell him we need to do this shit pronto so I can get to work (which admittedly was bull shit). So anyway, I get to his house and he tells me to go to the dollar store across the street. So I show up and he has me follow him and his friend in this sketchy ass fucked white car with a dealer's tag, of course. We go to these sketchy trap apartments and he comes to the window and grabs my cash. He gets back in the car and this tatted up cartel mother fucker comes out and jumps in the car. Now I'm used to that, because I live in Texas and BD is affiliated, though not completely in with these guys. 

So these dudes leave and go to the other side of the apartment. Then BD calls me and says ""Ay bro, homeboy doesn't have that much so I'm gonna run across the street and get it from my other homeboy"" I'm thinking whatever, BD is kinda weird and he does shit like this pretty often, and he's never given me reason not to trust him before. 

At this point I start waiting. A whole hour passes, and a cop rolls into the apartment complex so I start just kinda driving around the hood, stopping at gas stations, Jack In The Box, ya know just generally trying to not look sketchy. At one point I cut through the neighborhood of BD's house and I see that shitty white car with homeboy in it but no BD. This dude stares at me all threateningly as I drive by. 

Then I get the bad news. ""Ay bro, my friend's homeboy ran off with your bread there's nothing I can do."" Well. Fuck. I'm pissed but I can't do shit. The guy's affiliated and I'm an 18 year old white kid. Now I know y'all are probably thinking that this isn't a very intense jacking. Well shit ends up getting a little more fucked. 

So I'm driving along to go chill with my friend in the suburbs and out of the hood, hopefully smoke some herb to relax me from being pissed and BD calls again. He told me that his friend told him that I was saying that I was BD's cousin and wanted to know where he lived and how to get in his house and shit. I have literally no idea why he'd say this. So now I'm getting threatened by two hardcore mexican guys over the phone like ""You better not come back in this hood and try and do something stupid I got the strap right here"" and shit like that. 

So for some reason I had a random cartel dude spread rumors around the hood about me that I was looking for a guy's house that I'd been to a bunch of times.And I still have no clue why. 

But anyway, as sort of an epilogue, my friend happened to have another connect who met me to sell me some of the most fire shit I've ever had and hooked it up fat when he heard I got jacked. But then he basically forced me to smoke tar with him, which I've never done. I did cheese, and then IV. He started getting pissed when I tried to decline. So I fucking am chasing the dragon and it tastes fucked and I don't really like it at all. But whatever I still got throwed and made it home without going to jail or dying. 

But BD still texted me a few times tonight telling me not to come to the hood and shit so that's kinda got me a little nervous even though they don't know where I live as far as I know. Sorry for the long post, I just don't have anyone else to talk to about this shit. Any comments and tips about dealing with the threats and shit are welcome as fuck. Anyways, keep chilling and stay safe guys! Peace... ",1436586319.0

3d0elv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3d0elv/pst_best_technique/,21,https://redd.it/3d0elv,opiate_lifer,PST best technique,"This is condensed from a decade of use of my second favorite opiate behind pods, even though they are basically the same substance.

Additives to aid extraction? Forget em', I've tried them all and none are worth it. The morphine in opium on the seeds is morphine meconate, it is highly soluble in water alone.

I use a gatorade bottle and enough water to cover the seeds and come over their level, shake VIGOROUSLY up and down and side to side for 60-120 seconds per extraction and flip the bottle upside down over a cup or bowl and slowly open the threads on the cap til only water comes through and then squeeze until all water is out.

The biggest thing here is you want to be FAST, once the water hits the seeds especially for the first wash you want them in no longer than two minutes. The longer they are in the water the more water and dissolved goods they absorb. I've done tests and a short vigorous shake wins, leaving the seeds to soak for any amount of time is a waste.

A second wash done immediately has around 20% of the potency of the first, highly advised as to not waste. I also do 3rd and sometimes 4th washes and put them in the fridge to sip instead of water throughout the day as I hate waste, but they have 5% to less potency of the original wash.

Key here is speed, the less time the seeds have contact with water the better and vigorous shaking, also process 2nd,3rd,4th washes immediately.

With a little practice you can get this so automatic and down easy you can process pounds fast while watching TV, and keep a weeks worth of PST in the fridge if you're dependent and a daily user. Just get four large jugs for each stage of wash and combine them from each batch you process. If you can't refrigerate or have problems with mold a pinch of sodium benzoate added to each will work fine, it is sold in groceries in the spice aisle as preservative.

P.S.You can dry the seeds out afterward and give them away for cooking, they are fine to use as long as you dry them fast in the sun in a pan etc. Or spread them on uncut fields or areas and you can have a self replenishing source of fresh pods.",1436706728.0

I've learned that ""guilt"" is a positive thought/emotion designed to inform me that some choice I've made was a violation of a value I have. Thus, the pain produced via guilt is intended to promote a change in our actions so they are in agreement with our values. Shame on the other hand is a fear of what conclusions others will reach about who I AM if aware of some guilt-inducing choice I've made. Guilt and shame can be healthy motivaters because of the implicit message they contain for me about me. Namely, that I am not defined by a value-violating choice and that it is possible for me to do/feel better. 
As my age and use has progressed, I have developed a struggle with toxic shame.
 As I learned in treatment and even teach on now as a therapist, toxic shame is where I believe the value-violating choices I've made are a true reflection of who I am. What's more is how the resentment v. myself for existing as a _______ (pick your negative label) is ever-expanding and is progressively gaining a status of truth. Since all I am is a _________, why try to be anything else, feel anything else, and in the end, the world would be a better place without a _________ like me. The result is that I decay accordingly. Except, there is one inconvenient factor that attacks this ""truth,"" a collection of doubt-producing factors called ""exceptions.""

While I say I'm a failure, there are times in which I succeed. As evil as I see myself, there are times where I do good when no-one is looking just to do good, or when I feel I cannot truly love or be loved, I feel the power of loving or being loved. These exceptions create an enduring state of confusion in which I drift between hopeful pursuit of joy and other seasons in which I administer a secret hospice program of my soul with opiates while awaiting my release from this world or even better, a time I can drift freely about the waves fearlessly, with a sense of adventure, when the Me starring in the stories I and others still tell was alive. 

At other times, I fantasize about how future generations may have a procedure in which an unknown force or intervention can to wash away emotional memories that cause pain BUT the cav√©at is that all joyful ones would evaporate as well. If I stood before a button or consent form for such a thing, the scariest part is I don't know what I'd do. Sure, freedom from missing ""x"" or feeling ""y,"" would always be welcome. But the joy I have had as well, the sunny days that are ammo used to fire back and endure believing that it ""can't rain all the time,"" are in and of themselves, the root of pain bc they are things I had but lost. Most pain, almost all, is produced by longing for joys I have experienced: relationships of importance, phases of life featuring remaining innonence, stories of risks conquered, in the end, a Me that lacked the pessimism, scars, restraint, & bondage of reality that slays dreams and dreaming itself. A way I saw myself and the world that died and decayed following my inability to live like I once did, a former Me asphyxiated due to an inability to breathe in the air of hope, anticipation, being present, being free, being Me, I struggled to grasp for such air and eventually just knew, that I would die and no matter what I could think, that ""me""was extinct.

I felt this way before I began my first term in secret hospice and my use is not the cause of the pain I've felt. The depths of loneliness and pain are too great for ""normal""people to grasp. This ignorance is what leads good meaning people to say things that emphasize just how they cannot truly relate (""you will feel better if you just had a job""). These statements solidify my thought that I am alone. I am defective and the world knows.. But exceptions..damn exceptions. the cycle goes on but how do we get out? ",1436670686.0

I have been taking Norco 10 for several months now due to neck pain. I had an MRI done, which showed bulging discs, as well as disc tears. I live in Florida and I am currently traveling the US for 4 months for business. In Florida, as it may be with all other states, doctors are unable to refill narcotics, so I have to go to my doctor monthly. The last time I saw him, he said something to the effect of ""well there is no evidence showing you should be in so much pain"", which really pissed me off, as I'm not a junkie, or addicted to opiates. I haven't done any opiates in over a month, and haven't thought about them, as my neck felt pretty good.

Within the last week my neck is killing me again. I am currently in Boise, and it is a Saturday, meaning I cannot visit a normal doctor. I am considering visiting an Urgent Care, but with so much prescription fraud, I'm unsure what to do. I know a lot of Urgent Care facilities will see that I have come in for neck pain, and turn me away, or give me some Flexeril, which has done absolutely nothing for me.

I am unsure if I should tell the Urgent Care about my previous injury, and that I have been taking opiates for several months. In the past when I have been traveling and needed more medicine, my doctor suggested I bring my prescription bottles to a doctor or Urgent Care. When searching for information online, many people say that you definitely do not want to bring opiate bottles, as they're going to pinpoint you as an addict. Others say it may be beneficial to show that my primary care physician has been prescribing them.

I work all next week and am unable to take time off. I have already had to fly back to Florida once simply for a doc visit, which cost me several hundred dollars for a plane ticket. I'm not sure what my best option would be. I'm looking for suggestions. I'm not an opiate junkie, I haven't taken any opiates in over a month, but if I go into UC asking for a refill, they're going to think I'm an addict.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

So I bought drugs from a drug dealer who is known for some grimey shit. I've been buying from him for a while now and never had a problem, I would even give him rides in exchange for drugs. Recently though, I fucked up. I was giving him a ride, and we made a stop. He went into an apartment for something, and left a piece of paper in my car with his real name and address. I only knew him by a nickname. I had gotten high while he was in the apt. I can't give you a reason for this, but I wrote down his full name and address into the notes section of his contact in my phone. I had no plans on doing anything with that information. I don't know why I did it, I guess I've just always been curious what my drug dealers real names were. And I was high, so I knew I'd forget it if I didn't write it down. 

He came back to the car, and I told him I had to go to a bank nearby and I had to use the gps in my phone to find it. He grabbed the phone out of my hand without asking and said he could navigate. Well he looked around in my phone and guess what he found. Needless to say he was pissed. And he threatened me. I fucked up pretty bad and there was really no way I could make this not suspicious. I ended up dropping him off somewhere, and he told me if he saw me around the area he'd kill me. And he took my phone and got the password out of me. Everything is in that phone, like my girlfriends number and my mom and dad and my address in my gps and my name. Everything is there to blackmail me. 

I found an old phone at my house and got that activated with my same phone number. He called me last night and asked if I called the cops and I said no. This all happened yesterday. He called me today and I didn't answer, he texted after he called and said call me back. No threats of blackmail has been made or attempts of extortion or threats of coming to my house, but I'm incredibly anxious about this. I got the phone deactivated but they couldn't erase the data remotely on the phone so there's nothing I can do, my information is out there. 

I'm worried he could extort me for rides or money or whatever, and he has plenty of leverage. I guess I do too, but I don't want any confrontation. I want to stop getting high and just have this all go away. Advice please?",1436646149.0

I have probably about a .5g a day iv ecp habit when I can afford it. A lot of days though, I end up with nothing left in the morning before I go to work, so I take a couple mgs of suboxone instead. Now, everything on the Internet says you should wait at least 24 hours after your last dose to take a sub. It probably is just my metabolism, but I can take a sub 6-7 hours after my last dose, or at the very first sign of withdrawal (like those first chills you start to get) without suffering pwd. Now I know I'm not the only one here that can dose suboxone that soon after using, but it's just one aspect of it that's a little odd to me. 

The next thing is, I can take around 8mgs of sub and still get high on top of it. It's very slightly diminished in overall intensity, but I without a doubt have gotten high after taking it. Here's the thing though, it's not a very intense high (like I'm not nodding all over the place), but it feels like a lot of the effects are amplified. It's hard for me to describe but basically, I get that great warm opiate feeling (which I barely ever get with dope alone) with a solid amount of euphoria and a overall sense of well-being.  Suboxone always gives me a really good mood boost, like I can actually feel happy and interested in things, which dope doesn't really do on it's own. But when I take them together it's like I get that mood boost along with the other desirable effects of the opiates. It's easier for me to get to that point by taking subs then doing a shot of dope than it would be if I was just doing dope. 

So wtf. I mean I guess my body chemistry just works really well with suboxone, but why would I feel better on suboxone and dope than just dope alone. It kind of freaks me out, but I'm not complaining.",1436793925.0

3d3lvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3d3lvb/the_dream_storms/,53,https://redd.it/3d3lvb,morbo2000,The Dream Storms,"Kym is laying next to me in our bed.  I don't want to get up just yet.  The early morning gloom of opiate abuse weighs down my flesh and presses me into the sheets.  A stone body, cracking and crumbling in protest of the coming day.  Close your eyes.  Sleep.  I can smell the rain outside and clouds keep the sunshine locked away.  Only a lazy, filtered light creeps through. I roll over and look at Kym who smiles back at me.  She doesn't have to get up yet and is lingering awake only for me.  She can waste a few more waking minutes before she passes back into the dream world.

""Hey babe"" she says softly in the shadowy light while tracing her finger across my cheek.

""Good morning...or is it still night?  What time is it anyways?""  I ask looking around. I don't see the clock.  Actually, I don't see anything.  No walls or ceiling.  Just Kym and this bed.  

When did we get a bed?

""Hey babe, the CIA were down to three applicants.  They were in a room with a gun and had their spouses in the next room.  They told the first guy take a gun and go kill his wife.  He said No way and they let him go.  The second guy took the gun, went and the room but came back.  He couldn't do it, so they let him go.  The woman takes the gun, goes into the room and they hear gun shots followed by smashing furniture and screaming.  The woman walks out and says, This gun had blanks.  I had to beat him to death with the chair.""

And I start laughing.  And I can't stop.  It just pours out and I go fucking insane...  

""Wake up!  Are you crying?!  Hello!  Wake up!"" Sera cries shaking her lover.

""What!"" he asks finally snapping out of his trance.  He looks around and his eyes settle on Sera who watches him apprehensively.

""Are you ok?"" she asks.

""Yes.  Why?""

""You were screaming and breathing weird and...Oh.  You were dreaming about her right?""

She watches his face as it grows annoyed and turns away from her.  She sighs.

Why won't he let me in?  I give him everything.  And like a thief, he comes in any damn time and takes anything he pleases...but in the morning light Sera can see his beauty.  His morose nature kills her.  She is powerless in his dark eyes.  And Sera hates when the tiny amount of closeness she painstakingly builds with him crumbles like it just did.  She watches him get up and disappear into the bathroom.  

Sigh.

Later, he comes out into the living room.  It is Saturday and he might be a little grouchy she woke him up but he sleeps so much!  Twelve hours.  Troubled sleep, sweating into his sheets, tossing and turning and screaming...he is so unhealthy.  Takes too many pills and god knows what else.  She wonders for the millionth time, is he a junkie?

""I'm making eggs!  Do you want some?"" she asks cheerfully as he collapses on the couch and turns on the TV.  

""Sure.  Hey sorry I freaked out.  I'm a bear in the morning.  I hate being woken up but I guess I was laughing.  I dreamed someone told me a joke and I couldn't stop laughing.""

""It's ok"" she smiles as she butters toast and pours him coffee.  ""What was the joke?""

He seems to think for a moment and then shrugs.  ""Something about a woman killing her husband.""

She raises an eyebrow but is used to his brand of humor.  Always a little dark.  She brings him coffee the way he likes it.  Black with a spoonful of honey.  She wonders if he got high in the bathroom?  Long sleeves cover his arms. When he grows talkative it is usually from chemicals.  Oh well, he will get better.  He will change.  No one can do drugs forever.  And he is starting to smoke more pot.  That will help.

They eat breakfast and she tries to get him to accompany her to a flea market downtown.  Maybe.  As usual, 'maybe' is all he commits to.  They share a gram sized nugget of Mendocino in her glass bong.  If he is not stoned he barely eats anything but candy.  His body is so lean but she loves it.  Sparse, human form like something drawn from an anatomy art class.  So unlike her form.  Her form has too much spilling out here and there.  But he is always kind to her about that.  Unlike the others that offer diets or types of exercise.  He has never suggested anything demeaning.  He accepts her the way she is.  She smiles at this thought as he eats the breakfast she cooked for him.

He lazes on the couch and stares at the TV while she washes up.  Such a bachelor this guy!  If she doesn't wash the pan it will sit there until she comes back. So she washes it and all the dishes.  When she is done she searches his bookshelf for something to read.  Lots of boring books on astronomy and physics.  Computer programming language manuals and his love for ancient Greek and Roman history.  She loves fiction and this collection is sparse.  Besides a few science fiction books by Philip K. Dick, there is not much here.  But then she spots a copy of The Great Gatsby and pulls it out.  

A movie edition themed book starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow.  Heh.  Never would peg him for this but he has a lot of leftover books from college.  She opens and sees a stamp from some San Francisco book place called Dogeared Books and a price of $1.00.  She flips through the amazing movie stills with Robert Redford and an old photograph slips out.  She looks at it.  A picture of a girl.  Instantly she knows what she has in her hands.  Kim.  

It has to be.  The girl in his dreams.  The ghost in his heart.  The girl reclines casually on a couch smoking a cigarette.  And she's a blond.  Of course she is, sighs Sera.  God this girl is so thin and perfect looking.  Perfect hair, perfect makeup and perfect tits.  Sera studies the perfect pose as the girl looks up and meets the camera with intensely blue eyes.  Her wide, generous mouth is slightly parted like she is about to speak.  Her lips are shiny from candy red lipgloss.  It's just not fair, thinks Sera.  Girls like this are just fucking cruel and evil.  She looks kinda punk but has a formal feminine quality about her.  This look is not just thrown together as the picture implies.  The effect is a studied and practiced approach that Kim learned over the years.  How to bewitch men.  

Like him...

Sera looks across the room at the couch where he sits probably wasted on drugs though she is never 100% sure.  He stares vacantly at the TV.  Just watching, but not comprehending.  Is this the cause of the distance she always senses in him?  It must be.  I mean look at her.  It's fucking not fair!  

I'm so fat and gross.  

Seeing the picture shatters Sera's heart into a million pieces.  She slides it back into the book, places it back on the shelf and wipes her eyes.

""I'm leaving.""

He doesn't even look up.  

""Ok.  Call me later.  Maybe after you go to the flea market thing.  Lets get something to eat.""

""Ok.""  He doesn't notice my tears.  He never notices me.

Sera leaves the sudden sorrow inside the apartment for the fresh air on her face outside.  The door slams louder than she has ever slammed it before.  Did he even look up, she wonders?

The bartender was weary of Melo and Dev when they walked in.  The street imparts a greasy, lived in look to their ragged clothing.  Plus a weariness in their faces and eyes.  He could kick them out based on the old No Shoes, No Shirt, No Service rule.  The man is wearing only a vest which technically is not a shirt and the girl is barefoot.  But hell, it's a lovely day.  The owners are not here to hassle him so screw it.  Plus a tall kid, all in black just walked over and hugged them both like old friends.  He invites them to a table.  

The street guy in the vest sits next to a short, solid looking bald kid in scuffed boots.  A blue flannel covers a Mickey Mouse t-shirt underneath.  He has a safety pin shoved through his nose.  Everyone knows this guy.  His name is Jason and he sells cocaine at the Warfield.  Super friendly kid, a great tipper and usually the loudest asshole in the room.  The tall one in the studded, black leather jacket has a long, black mohawk pulled into a ponytail.  This guy is a student and sometimes comes in with his homework as his friends drink and play pool.  Very quiet and just sort of fades into the background.  He sits next to the beautiful blond with dandelion hair.  Everyone in the bar has notices her.  Purple and blue eyeliner make her blue eyes glow unnaturally bright.  She's dressed in a plaid miniskirt, black tights and tall combat boots.  Her crop shirt is ridiculously tight and revealing.  When she stands up to order at the bar all the males watch.  They start at her low cut top and then their eyes pour down her smooth belly past the gold belly chain that dangles off tantalizing hips that swish back and forth as she walks.  
And fuck, what an ass.  

The short homeless girl seems drunk already.  Wobbly, slurring and unsteady.  She leans against the blond and gets up only to dump more change in to the CD jukebox and plays the same damn song over and over.  Linger by the Cranberries.  She catches me staring at her as she bums a drag from the blond's cigarette.  She blows a perfect smoke ring and as the halo frames her eyes, she winks at me and says ""Time to wake up.""

The alarm rips Steve out of the dream and he groans, hungover and head full of sand and beer.  In the darkness he finds the glowing numbers displaying the ungodly hour of 5:10 am.  He turns off the alarm.  His wife stirs next to him.

""Gotta go honey"" he whispers and kisses her temple as she scrunches beneath the blankets.

""Have a good day"" she groans.  Then she turns towards him as he pulls on his t-shirt.  ""You ok?  You were talking again.""

""Yeah I was dreaming..."" he yawns while rubbing face, ""My old job in San Fran.  Remember I was working at Shotwells when we met?  Sometimes I dream of the people that used to come in.  Kinda inspires me to paint.""

""You should honey.  After work I'll have Charlie napping and you can sneak in and go to your studio.  All those sketches you have need to be painted.  With a little luck, you can sell some more.""

Steve looks at his wife and smiles in the dark.  

Already twenty-five minutes have ticked by.  But Sera is crying.  The release is needed because her face in the world is a huge, beaming smiley face.  The happy-go-lucky fun, fun, fun, girl.  The one to bring your problems too.  The one that will help you out anytime.  The one who will be your friend in your hour of need even though you have ignored her phone calls inviting you to the movies for weeks.  The amount of Kleenex she uses here is testament to the power of Dr. Sawyer.  

Dr. Sawyer is the sort of woman Sera yearns to be.  Assertive, yet kind.  Comfortable, yet open.  So far all Sera has achieved in life is being open.  And being open has let others come in and hurt her.  So here she is.  Thank goodness her insurance covers these sessions.  Sera loves the forty-five minutes because her old therapist just gave her pills.  Dr. Sawyer pokes and prods and tries to understand.  Even though she pays for this, Sera is grateful.  

No one else bothers to know her.

""So how is your boyfriend Donald?  You told me last week he was fired from his waiter position at Dave and Busters for taking too many sick days"" says Dr. Sawyer.

""Yeah.  I guess he didn't want to go to work during March Madness.  He loves college basketball.  But we broke up.  I haven't seen him for awhile.""

""Really?  And who initiated this?""

""Oh I did.  He's jealous and I don't know, after he borrowed the money you told me not to loan him, he got weird"" muses Sera.  

""Weird?""

""Yeah.  He hates my friend.  I told him that you know, we have been intimate and he couldn't deal.  But after he got the money you were right.  He just disappeared.  Probably gambling, I don't know.  So I decided I don't need him.""

""And what about the $500 Sera?  Did you at least get anything in writing?""

""No.  Just gave him a check.""

Dr. Sawyer smiles and reaches over and squeezes Sera's hand.  ""Well Sera, it is money.  It is a principal.  But if you don't care, I won't make it anything bigger than that.""

""I don't care.  Now I have something to ask him if he calls and I don't feel like hearing his bullshit.  I don't need him.""    

""You don't need him because of your friend?  Sera, remember we talked about how your friend is interfering with YOUR happiness?  How he just uses and takes but offers nothing in return?  Do you recall that conversation?"" asks Dr. Sawyer in her mellow, slow voice.

""Yes.  I know"" sighs Sera.  ""I get it but...I just want him to be happy.  He has everything.  He has-""

""Everything that he has are qualities you assign to his personality.  These are your versions Sera.  Does he truly live up to these standards?  You said he is distant and closes you off.  You worry he might be a drug addict.  He is obsessed with a woman from his past.  Sera, is this the ideal person for you?  Or is this you trying to help someone who doesn't want help?  Sure he will take it.  You have allowed him to use you and from our sessions, he uses you frequently.  But besides the sex, what are you getting out of this arrangement?""

Sera stares at Dr. Sawyer.  She understands every word for she is not a fool.  But her heart doesn't care.  Who cares about the right choice?  The smart choice?  How come no one understands sometimes there is only one choice?  She can be there for him, hold him up when he needs it.  And one day, when he finally wakes up from his nightmare, he will see her.  And he will be happy.    

But instead she smiles at her therapist and nods.  ""Ok.  I know.""

And the sampled Buddhist chime bell sounds from her computer timer signifying forty minutes has passed.  The last five minutes is to gather yourself which Sera begins to do.  She blows her nose and sips the Fiji bottled water they serve here.

""Sera"" says Dr. Sawyer quietly, ""you must move on and do what is right for you. You are a person with needs.  You cannot solve his problems.  That is his job.""

""Ok"" nods Sera.  

Dr. Sawyer stares at her trying to give the message some weight. Uncomfortable, Sera changes the focus and uses the same trick the therapist uses when she tries to validate her love choices.  She picks something new and asks an open ended question.  

""I like your new painting"" says Sera looking at the art on the wall by the window.
 
Pub setting.  A long bar, dotted with many beer taps stretches towards the back where a pool table stands.  But the focus is on a table off to the right with five patrons.  Two men conspire together at the front of table.  Behind them, against the wall, a shadowy man in black sits up straight and stares off at nothing.  A blond woman next to him follows his gaze.  Next to the blond is mousy little brunette smoking a cigarette who seems to look straight out of the painting at you.  The effect is eerie.  Her face is child-like and her feet appear bare.  She stares through a barely visible smoke ring.

""Oh yes!  You noticed that hmm?  It's called The Dream Storms.""  Dr. Sawyer smiles.  She collects paintings and is very conscious about design and color.  Sera knows this and sits back in her chair sipping bottled water anticipating the next patient will have a slight delay in scheduling.

""I fell in love with this piece when I saw it at a Rolfo Gallery downtown.  They had two works left from a new painter named Steven Cumis.  They say he's truck driver for grocery stores but all of his paintings are from his bartending days in San Francisco"" smiles Dr. Sawyer.  ""To be honest, Sera I love the way these kids look.  That time in life when you have to display to the world how you feel.  I was going to Berkley in the 80's and this piece just evokes that feeling of being free with all the time in the world.  When I saw it I had to buy it.""

Sera has this power.  You find that piece people carry around like a tiny trophy.  You hint about it, draw it out and next thing you know they are lost in their happiness.  Sera knows she has the good doctor when she puts away her notepad and pen and starts talking.

""Oh the imagery and subjects are so powerful!  I tell you Sera, this guy won't be driving trucks for long.  Look at the young girl staring right out the painting!  Amazing focus!""

""Yeah"" agrees Sera.  But she is no longer looking or thinking about the painting.  

She knows she will call him simply because he asked her too.  But at least he'll answer the phone.  Are other people this helpless?  The world keeps spinning and Sera holds on.  ",1436769348.0

needles exchange doesnt exist here and needles aint so cheap.

I use anywhere from 140-180mg of morphine a day now. I mostly get my morphine from really strong poppy seeds, and lately I've been making basic flake opium. I don't buy pills or heroin often anymore because I feel it's much cheaper and ""safer"" to make my own shit. I'm a full time assistant biologist, and to be honest I fucking love my life, shit gets better for me everyday, all while supporting my habit, my friends and family don't really mind since I'm not fucking up. 

.


Anyways, at anytime I keep at least 40 pounds of poppyseeds incase the site I order from gets shut down, or something gets lost in the male, by doing this, I haven't WD'd in close to 2 years, I plan out my daily usage in a planner as to not use too much and raise my tolerance more than needed. 



But, this time I fucked up. As I finish off a bag of poppyseeds, I go to check my emergency supply and find out I only have FIVE POUNDS LEFT! Which is maybe 5 days worth of tea if I really stretch it and taper down. My next shipment wasn't supposed to arrive until 2 weeks later. I'm thinking ""what the fuck am I going to do?? I'm so close to running out and I've got to teach an entire auditorium full of students about ocean/life/recycling, which I simply cannot do in WD. I was a nervous wreck. The day I ran out I called in sick, since it had been so long since I'd experienced WD I was in absolutel agony, I literally layed in the shower crying for like 12 hours, every inch of my body hurt, migraines, sweating like a dog even though my condo was 62 degrees, throwing up, I was so tired but couldn't even lay on my bed because the RLS would start up instantly. I know this makes me sound like a pussy but I was this close to killing myself. Everything in life went from perfect to absolute hell in 24 hours, I love my life, but every second felt like an hour, it felt like I was crouched in that shower for weeks.


.
Desperately I pull my self out of the shower and search my entire house for poppyseeds, and old OXY, ANYTHING, and what did I find??

.
Well first I found a bottle of 20 5mg hydros I didn't know I had. I ate all 20 in the span of 5 minutes (RIP liver), but I'm sure you folks understand that level of desperation. But that's  not much, obviously, but when I found it I cried with relief. About a hour later I found my 40 pounds of poppyseeds under my fucking bed! I hid it there when I cleaned my closet!!! I felt so ducking stupid! I put myself through horrible depressing agony for no reason I could have lost my job if I missed more days!


.
To top things off, the next day I got an early shipment of  20lbs of poppyseeds I didn't expect, so now I've got like 55 pounds or so...wow...I'm so stupid sometimes. I've experienced WD countless times but this time was so much worse because of what I had to lose, and because it had been so long since I experienced WD because of my planning ahead. Just thought you guys might think this was funny/interesting. I usually never have good WD/junkie Jesus stories so I wanted to share.

3d5yns,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3d5yns/my_shortlived_homeless_adventure/,35,https://redd.it/3d5yns,her0ine_,my shortlived homeless adventure.,"I got kicked out of the rehab I was in on a Thursday morning, around 7:30am. It was a ""work therapy"" program in San Francisco, which basically meant we all worked 40+ hours a week in a warehouse in exchange for room and board, a couple education classes a week, one group therapy session, one 1-on-1 counseling session, and a helluva lot of chapel. To be honest, I didn't actually want to leave, and the offense I committed that got me discharged was purely an accident. But hey, shit happens. 

They offer me a phone call -- my family actually only lives about an hour away -- but I refuse. It's not my first time getting kicked out of rehab, and I'm stubborn enough that I'd rather be homeless than ask my family for help. 

It's kindof fucked up, but the way it works with the program I was in, is you get kicked out in the morning but you don't get your shit back till the afternoon. So, it's 8:00am on a Thursday morning in beautiful San Fran. All I have are the clothes I'm wearing, and I won't get any of my personal belongings until 3:30pm, at which time I'll have to return to the center to get it all. The second I'm through those doors, my goal is clear: get high. Find a way to cop with no money, no connections, no phone. 

It turns out that it's not *that* difficult to do if you're a halfway pretty girl. My goal is basically to look sad until someone asks me what's wrong. I meet a guy named Keith. We get to talking, and after feeling out the situation, I ask if he'll help me cop. He says he can't make any promises but he'll at least introduce me to some of his buddies. We go to... well, I can't say specifically here, but let's just say a part of SF where you can get pretty much anything you need. Keith introduces me to his friend Joe. Joe smokes crack. Joe has been awake for several days now. Joe is just about to pick up his paycheck and is feeling generous. Keith warns me about Joe but, hey, I'm going where the free dope is. Keith leaves. Now it's just me and Joe.

We go for a walk to get his check, and then to get his check cashed. I tell him several times that I have no money, and he assures me that he's just feeling generous and I don't owe him anything. Soon, I find myself with $40 worth of black, a 10-pack of rigs, a cooker, cottons, and a lighter. And all I did was look pretty and flirted a little. Why did I ever pay for my dope before!?? 

The first shot after 36 days clean = *bliss.* Even the little test shot I did gave me a nice warm rush. Nothing will ever compare to the first shot *ever,* but slamming after a month or more clean is the closest I'll ever get to recapturing that rush. 

Joe introduces me to crack. I had done coke, meth, and heroin before, but never crack. The effects are a lot more subtle than I thought they'd be... but maybe that's because I had already shot up some of the tar I got. Mostly I remember my lips being super numb, my throat kindof tight, and a boost of euphoric energy. 

Now we're back at Joe's studio apartment. It's a disgusting mess, but nothing I've never seen before... I guess addicts don't make the best housekeepers. He starts getting weird. I'm itching like crazy at this point (always do when I use after a period of sobriety) and scratching uncontrollably. He tells me he likes seeing me squirm. It's about 2:45pm now so I have to leave to get my shit back from the rehab center. He won't let me leave. He keeps yelling at me to ""just wait a minute."" I'm fairly certain I know where this is going. He's sitting on the bed high as a kite, and I get up to ""get a spoon"" from the kitchen. I run out the door, hearing him yell behind me, and sprint down the stairs. For the next 15 minutes I'm nervously looking behind me, but he never follows. I get to the center just around 3:30 for my stuff, and I'm pretty sure they can all tell I'm high as fuck. 

Anyway, there is my first ~8 hours as a ""homeless"" person in SF. haha. I started a new reddit account for this; my other one was pretty active in this sub, but I wanted to start fresh. I can go on if anyone's interested. This happened a little while ago and, no, I'm not homeless anymore. I eventually (after a couple weeks) just said ""fuck it"" and called my mother. So now I have a roof over my head but, to be honest, I'm not sure which is better.",1436817657.0

(LOTS OF TEXT)","i've been lurking here for a few months now, and i finally decided to make an account and post. this is an introduction to me and my story, for those who want to waste some time and for those who are relatively interested.

2009 - in the beginning of my senior year in high school i had gotten a toenail pulled. my father, being prescribed lortab 7.5/325s took pity on the pain i was in at the time and gave me one. this was also the day halo 3: odst released and i remember playing that game in awe at the colors and the feeling that took over me, along with the numbness that followed. i asked him for another that night and promptly fell asleep. now, i had used pot and alcohol at this point but nothing harder, so i was no stranger to getting high or drunk. however, i had never felt anything like this. a few weeks later i stole from his bottle which he always left out in the open (ahhh, the good old days) and he passively accused me of it though of course i didn't admit to it. i didn't touch it from october of that year until the following year.

2010 - at this time, my family lived in an apartment with the landlords living in the area beneath us. during snowfall and blizzards i'd help shovel and get paid a few bucks for my time. well, one day in february i moved wrong and tore my back up pretty bad and exacerbated the scoliosis i was diagnosed with about 3 years back. my father again took pity on me and gave me some of his shit, but this time it hooked me unlike the last time. every day before leaving for work, or for school, or to go chill with my friends, i'd grab one or two and eat them and feel fucking great. this got worse when a potential relationship with a girl fell through, and one or two turned into three or four at a time. 

at this time, i wasn't smoking much pot due to a panic attack so the lortab offered a high that was calming yet intense and was always the same no matter what. things were consistent through graduation and the summer, i started smoking again as well. august of that year i had my first buy from a friend's leftover stash from surgery and was taught about insufflation and i began to use that method whenever possible because it hit me harder. 

however, my father started noticing more and more and i was clashing with him more often. he got more creative with hiding spots that took me weeks to find, or hiding keys that took me weeks to find to open the lock blocking my way to the goodies i wanted so bad. when i wasn't using, i was smoking pot i bought off a coworker from my deadend retail job i worked at the time. 

as a freshman at my community college with a full scholarship, i met a girl who i fell head over heels for. we courted for a month and a half, dated for 2 months, then she ended it with barely any reason. she knew about the drugs and didn't care, but later on i found out it was my inflexible and manic personality that got to her. i suffered from a lot of mood swings and outbursts and it pushed her away. i was absolutely crushed, and asked my pot dealer about buying pills along with a good friend of mine who shared the same habits. turned out they both sold, and i was introduced to the wonderful world of oxycodone. i remember the first time was using 20s, and it blew my mind. then i got some endocet 10/325s (which became my absolute fucking favorite) and it was over. the claws were set in.

2011 - at this time, my drug usage was privatized and downplayed. it wasn't a problem or a big deal. my best friend from high school knew, and a friend i met from a class the past semester knew. let's call them B and A. B is a musician, and needed a drummer to start a band. A was a drummer, and so i introduced the both of them. it wasn't long until we all started chillin for band practices that i sat in on high as fuck and they began to use as well.

i got the girl i met in late 2010 back, but my habit furthered. i only took my dad's stuff when everyone i knew was dry (out of the 3-4 connects i had in early 2011). she had addiction problems herself in her life and said that if i kept shit reasonable it would work out. then we started getting high, and between spending money for my own drugs, for her drugs, for us to do things together while we were on drugs, paying for her gas (i didn't drive then and still don't now)... the financial aid refunds i received from my school that were about $5000 were gone in 6 months. the drugs caused fights, we couldn't go to NYC for st. patty's day, i almost got arrested when we did go to NYC for a rusko concert and i got patted down entering the venue. it was looking bad and she ended it in may 2011.

at that point i fucked up my schooling. my first semester i was super average (always an A and B student in high school), the second i just didn't care and ditched class and lied to my parents about classes cancelling etc. eventually i failed all but one class i passed with a D and my aid got suspended, forcing me to tell my parents everything. i was put into therapy and under anti-depressants, and this allowed me to get my financial aid back over time. my bank account was monitored by my parents as part of the conditions for staying home and not going into rehab. i couldn't find my father's stash either, so what did i do? i stole from that dead end job i mentioned earlier, got arrested and escorted out in front of my ex-girlfriend who was picking me up that day to work things out. luckily i was released with just an appearance ticket but all the ""trust"" i built up by manipulating and playing my family was gone and i had to start from square one again, this time with being broke and not having a job and school starting right around the corner.

this effectively ended the relationship between my ex and i, despite my trying and her trying. things were too far gone. my friends reacted oppositely. A got in trouble for something and we bonded immensely, meanwhile B remained very much critical and stayed away from the situation. A and i leaned on each other, and we formed a plan using one of my contacts that got rid of endocet 10/325s at $5 each. we both save money, we cop in october, we hold till thanksgiving and celebrate the hard work. we got up the night we copped, but did manage to save the rest. now, this plan happened after i got a job at a grocery store where i got paid more than minimum and got decent hours so i brought in a lot of cash and saved most of it. between that and the financial aid money, i had about 4 grand saved up. things were good.

then i met a girl, my current girlfriend of almost four years, and things were great. money in my pocket, habit under control, love in my life, grades were back, trust regained. i could control this, i know i could.

2012 - nope. A and i kept close while we distanced from B, and he spiraled out of control, eventually getting pulled over by a drug detective and almost getting locked up one night. his connects became my connects through him, and slowly my money shriveled up as prices went up and my morals went down. by the end of the spring semester i was broke again and i had introduced another to the life: my girl. thankfully i have been able to keep her out of using up to 100mgs a day and she does about 10 mgs to be happy and satisfied, but this was yet another introduction.

B mended fences with A and i, and we expanded our group, eventually adding 4-5 more people and throwing monthly ""glass table nights"" where we'd robotrip, smoke, drink, use pills, etc. this only lasted a little bit though because of the eventual bullshit that occurs in a group full of drug addicts: shit-talking each other.

2013 - i'm also a womanizer, and a cheater. A and i tag-teamed a girl i knew back in the day, and this formed a rupture with our friendship. he felt i was a bad influence, and i was. B latched onto this, never really meaning his apology from the year before. everyone else from the group stayed away except one kid who eventually ghosted on me anyway. i was in my own boat with my drugs and my girl, and that was it.

this broke me, and i became angry. using more to get away, stealing money to get up, stealing my dad's shit. it was all about getting a fix. some coworkers and friends from high school, M and T, were sources for me at this time. T had his own script of percs, so i was fucking happy with that. the plan was each month, M and T and me split it 3 ways and i paid $150 for 30-40 of them. M got greedy, tried cutting me out, T told me, i spoke to M, and somehow afterwards we were friends once shit got patched up. but we all fed off each other and enabled each other.

at this point in school, i was supposed to graduate in 2013's spring semester. my personal issues along with my usage made me no show and call out of an internship, i was placed on probation for the internship, and got fucked over by a technicality based on weather and not getting to the seminar class. i took another semester of a different major just to stay in school but at the end of the fall semester the rules changed and the title IV appeal i could've done to get aid back (by saying hey i need these classes i can get this done now) were no longer offered. 

2014 - my family moved from town/city border of the city we were in to another town about 15 minutes away. things got difficult at this time because due to not driving, i had to plot and scheme to get into my hometown to cop from my connects. now, when my family was doing all this, i loaned them 1500 and they gave me back 1750 the day after we moved. it lasted a month, doing 150 mg a day and paying for people's shit added up. i was also taking my dad's on top of this to use it to hold me over and keep me less sick while i figured out how to score on that given day. 

dad got crafty this time, confronted me, we laid down some rules for me to not get kicked out, and he put a padlock on a door in the new room. now i was broke and withdrawal was setting in and i wasn't happy. luckily i took an opportunity at that grocery store i worked out and started making $200+ a week instead of $120 or so. money started adding up. 

M and T were my boys, we were chillin all the time and getting high and suffering when we couldn't. my boy A started dealing and eventually he got popped. i was a client of his for a few months, and i saw him about 2 hrs before on the night he got arrested. i felt guilty to a point.

T was on probation for a prior charge. he was told his time was done and he was good to go. he never notified them of a change of address and they considered him in violation of his probation. M and i were shook knowing 2 ppl we were close with were in prison or jail in a matter of months. we got closer and became partners in crime, scheming how to cop, how to rip kids off, how to make side money, the works. 

T got out towards the end of the year, and i landed him a job at my dad's work place along with M who i did that for earlier in the year. i work there occasionally, helping with inventory as temporary help. well, they started distancing and before i knew it i didn't speak to them for a month. turns out M had some petty issues and didn't want to talk about it. once things were patched up i told him to just keep me in the loop and be honest. the friendship was always more than the drugs to me.

2015 - M sobered up, T violated again and is back in jail, A came out of prison and got off free and is dealing again, B and i are tight again, and my girl and i are still together. i continue to lie, cheat, and steal but passively and not as badly as i once did. i am broke, despite taking out loans to support my habit. i'm trying to get back to school and to learn to drive but between being high and spending money i don't know if i'll do either and i have about a month left before i need to begin paying student loans/get to school to defer those loans. through it all, i've still never used dope, though i've had other friends that have and ODed and died or it ruined their lives. 

i guess it feels good to type everything out, and for those who read it all i salute you. i'm looking forward to being a part of the community, and i apologize for the long post. i'd rather be more than a faceless name on here and if this helps you all get to know me better then so be it.",1436970642.0

An psychotic account of psychosis. By Alicia M. S





**Hell's Kitchen**



I'm not estranged from pain so I call to God to take me so I can die content today if it is gods will for 
my death today. I knew at the time that if my body was found I would have died doing what I love: 
photographing nature and in the absence of distraction as I wondered and wondered at the brilliant 
essence of nature-- the purity and simplicity was all I asked God for to guide me that day as I 
admitted to myself that I didn't have all the answers, and I extended my hand for help to God to 
guide me in a time of deep confusion and utter despair. I maintained my loyalty to myself and my 
loyal to my truth as all involved family members were told of my intended plans for recovery and 
return was true, yet I chose not to disclose the suffering I had endured to spare my loved ones the 
grief of my pain as the truth would irreparable hurt them, so yet again the burden was mine to 
behold. The white paper that followers is a full disclosure to all pain that I have experienced and 
endured that testifies to the th√© √©vils of Man that has the ability to perverts love and human 
kindness. 


On my lips a mantra of the lords prayer was fearfully recited for hours while my tortured soul sought 
redemption from my prior sins and while i prayed for elevation out of the evil that was being 
imposed on me by the will of others in an effort to gain my will and obedience. In Toledo I 
whispered for help not knowing what help was requires to tame the spirits that produced scratch 
marks on my arms and legs that couldn't be explained by human reason and logic. I was being 
brainwashed with lessons of voodoo, demonic possession, and paranormal phenomena. I didn't 
understand the evidence of the dark occult experiences or it's ramifications on my sanity, yet each 
day I fought to restore my own sense of judgement and morals while utilizing the mysteries of the 
occult that I learned to protect myself from imminent harm that others wanted to impose on me for 
reasons not understood. I learned that my primary choice was to wait for the opportune moment to 
exact revenge by eliminating my attackers or by disappearing without a trace. I was a hostage 
having no choice but to only empathize with my enemy to understand and master the art of war that 
was being used against me to survive the various attacks unscathed and intermittently use their 
psych ops tactics against them to restore bits of my sanity without them realizing my minor 
rebounds against their abuse. What was my ordeal meant to evoke? At the time it provoked a 
anger and blind rage that Created a blood thirsty lust for revenge. I prevailed in the constant face 
of fear and attempts of others to break my will and brain wash me, so I could be used for a pleasure 
of the flesh. The ominous terror I experienced lead to a new beginning without complete psychosis 
ending in my soul death. My will couldn't be broken because I didn't fear for death for death was 
the ultimate end which would lead to a saving grace or a savage beast and I believe my will was 
gods will and whatever happened would satisfy fate, Gods fate for me. I was at a disadvantage 
due to my disability and at an advantaged for my spiritual gifts bestowed upon me. I prevailed 
morally and spiritually thus winning the battle that pitted good against evil pure and simple.
 I have a heart of gold. I tell the truth and I'm known for that. No one would ever second guess my 
word here cause I come through for those I care about at all coats. I am loyal until either they aren't 
worthy or my loved ones have been Those who try to punk me get squashed with a forked tongue 
or a wire noose around their neck.

D: 

 I was never a liar. I always looked out for u because I had strong values regarding marriage
 which is a value that I believed u used to manipulate me. Who did u meet from jail in Oregon. Who 
did you met you in the forest? I have a witness Dan. I think u owe me the truth. I wouldn't die would 
I? My etheric body wouldn't disassociate from my physical body to finish the dissemination of my 
astral body. Also you can kill an angel of light serving gods will. I know u brought me to Oregon for 
something unconstitutionally wrong for my well being. What was it a initiation ceremony for you. I 
experienced being stabbed and painful sensations on my arms and legs.
 I felt gun shots barraging my head as I felt the cold,sticky substance pouring from my head that I 
didn't second guess as blood. I wouldn't leave consciousness. I was shot in the upper leg and it 
was almost blown off so a wolf of.a dog took my calf from the upper leg and ripped it off to utilize as 
a dog bone yet I knew I'd live die or regenerate a new limb if god so willed it to be. My hands were 
pierced as well as my legs. I accepted death after I confessed all of my sins and forgave all those 
who took part in assaulting me for the sake of tormenting me I the present and in the past. I 
forgave them all and for this I wasn't killed for their sin of brutal attempted murder because I came 
to at some point before dawn waking to the sun. The guns helicopters heavy machinery and 
emergency vehicles where gone. The people that hunted me where gone. I only began to fight to 
live when I was dying and they would leave me in peace so at that point I scared them off by 
struggling and fighting... I felt I had the right to die without spectators or any last jabs. I came to 
around sun up with scars and lacerations. I attempted to get up but realized I had one leg until it 
materialized at first like snow and then into a solid form. The wounds begun to heal before my eyes 
and I knew,that I had been reborn but to where. I looked around and God rewarded me for my 
blind faith In the truth that gods will would determine my fate. I realized my family would be sparred 
of pain and suffering from my assumed freakish death only described by washing sins through 
sacrificing myself to the savior to show my complete gratitude and dedication to forgiving all people 
that attacked me and whose black sullied souls were forgiven in a selfless act of me forgiving 
them for their transgressions thus affording them another chance at a life path of redemption 
towards happiness Instead of perpetuating bitterness and pain in a cowards mob mentality. I gave 
all of them all a clean slate forgiving and dying for their sins and I started with a blank state since I 
was too forgiven and reincarnated into my same physical body to dedicate my existence to faith of 
a higher power and to be selfless in living to cure the woes of man and perpetuate gods will. 



After this incident however I no longer needed to empathize with the suffering of the savior so I 
focused on staying alive at all coats cause this generation wasn't going to eradicate the one who 
was chosen to exact Gods Will: the archangel of death. I was always ready for an attack. I watched 
people as if they were victims of my I'm,eminent threat if they made a wrong move. . A distance 
observing their behaviors and the manner I'm which I sparked their interest. Any change of 
imminent danger I pulled my weapon prepared to fight to the death since most were bigger than 
me, mostly grown killers. I would fall asleep and I would wake up with patches of akin missing nod I 
grew to know that when I woke up in a rage it was due to the fact that I was killed for fun or to take 
a part of my flesh to graft to theirs because I believed they were crafting my god given reincarnated 
flesh to advance their evil intention to artificially evolve gaining. Ore power after each kill. Often 
times I didn't realize the killing game was been played due to deep seated deception, so after I 
awoke from a violent death I grew insolent with rage at the gross disrespect of peers killing me for 
experience or fun leaving me in the dark about their true desires and intentions to hurt me and 
justifying the action by knowing that I would regenerate and forget the pain until I manifested the 
desire to remember the kill. Others assumed I wouldn't realize I would be killed so I was 
frequently stabbed in my sleep and I wasn't given more than 72 hours to recuperate so my skills 
acquired in regeneration weren't often developed because no one taught me the rules of the game. 
They took advantage of my ignorance so my advancement was slow until I developed the ability to 
remember the pain involved in the trauma of death and I developed the ability to forecast the future 
killings by seeing blood splatter. They used me as a pawn to calculate how long it would catch me 
to understand the rules. I acquired the knowledge fast and I warned them of their death by pulling 
my most lethal knife without hesitation and giving them a change to challenge me and die or run in 
fear. This brutal truth caused them to run most often. I would protect myself at all costs. I used 
hammers ice picks modified weapons, knives, razors and fire if I could. My forked tongue was used 
to give the truth even though it hit where it hurt. I took not one iota of deceit and I lunged violently at 
fawning ignorance because I saw the scars on my neck where flesh had been removed in my 
sleep, the blood splatter, and I felt the deceit and evil like a swarm of pests thick in the air. I was 
fighting a war against everyone around me. They were all possessed by immortality and we're 
fascinated by more intriguing ways to kill. They were sick. Whack. I was a mercenary to protect my 
talents that the enemy hated because they failed to understand how my mind ticked and they couldn't 
create any fear to further harm me. Instead they fell back on insults that were false and attacked 
every being of my character that incited a blind rage ticking like a bomb inside of me. Calculated 
killing sprees by half a dozen people practicing their on the psychotic tendencies of me added 
injury to insult when I only wanted normality, yet I knew too much. 



Another person used to torment me with spreading hurtful lies about my acclaimed lack of moral 
character and the claim that I would do and say stuff totally off the wall that I never remembered 
saying. I was accused of evoking demons and I was told I was possessed by demons wanting to kill 
people in my company. I felt as if I was going mad by the accusations and this developed into a 
severe vengeful rage that precipitated me to go hunting to find a victim that would dare to further 
insult my intelligence because I was itching to cut the head off of a demon saving the world some 
suffering from the sempiternal cycle of mail intent disguised as common decency. 
I wanted some demonic controlled person to test me cause i wasn't flinching as I remained I'm 
proper for canvassing for my sign of my accusers. No one would help me or believe me so I took 
matters into my own hands and performed acts that no other woman probably has. Fear wasn't a 
concern. The concern was my mental condition worsening my humans influenced by demons that 
has allowed. Inhabit their body by opening up their heart of stone to the demons desire to create 
chaos and severe confusion. I would have disabled them with the machete and then I would have 
driven a rusty railroad spike into their bloodless heart. Devoid of a soul I wouldn't be afflicted by the 
release of the soul. Once a soul has been sold for Earthy treasures the only recourse is death by 
decapitation And a rusty iron spike nailed in the chest as to penetrate and cease the functioning of 
the heart. 




Your already a fallen angel---your life in lot in life in made. I'm above that yet live as you will as you 
might wish to you live yet you can't deny who you are and I have embraced who I am. I am no kind of kind.
The Birth of Chaos from the Death of Romance.
Black trees creak in the wind.
Swathed in dark distance.
The gale's howl echoes the blackness in my heart.
As each ending brings a beginning.
So the death of romance becomes.
The birth of chaos and melodrama.
Hell's fury at midnight will inspire my evil genius.
To forge the furious phantasms.
Of which nightmares are made.
Moonlit rites and secret spells.
Diabolic bindings and demonic conjuring.
Weave the widow's web.
Let Hella and Loki reign.
Let the Underworld rise like Pluto's deadly sphere.
As the world runs towards its darkest hour.
Hear the winds of limbo rage.
While love's faded flowers scatter before it.
Frosted petals flying past the ghostly trees.
At winter's bitter end.
Lightning flashes below the spooky moon.
Swathed in mist blown sideways.



Along with magic's taboo... What was this meant to evoke? I didn't work. I prevailed and the ominous terror 
lead to a new beginning end without succumbing to complete psychosis because I didn't not fear 
the wrath. Instead I walked head on with my bible and did what Christ what of done. Yeah I was 
persecuted yet I prevailed morally and spiritually winning the battle born of faulty tactics that would 
only work on bitches and the evil at heart. I have a pure heart of gold. I tell the truth and I'm known 
for that. No one would ever second guess my word here cause I come through for those I care 
about at all coats. I am loyal until either they aren't worthy or my loved ones have been separated. 
Coming back all my friends told me of what they heard about in Oregon. I have been showered with 
small tokens and I'm respected. Those who try to punk me get squashed with a corked tongue or a 
wire. I was never a liar. I always looked out for you because I had strong values regarding marriage 
which I believed you used to manipulate me. Who did you meet from jail in Oregon. Who met you in the 
forest? I have a witness Dan. I think you owe me the truth. I wouldn't die, would I? My etheric body 
wouldn't disassociate from my physical body to finish the dissemination of my astral body. Also you 
can kill a angel of light serving gods will, Azriel. I know you brought me to Oregon for something 
unconstitutionally wrong against me. What was it a initiation ceremony for you. I experienced being 
stabbed and painful sensations on my arms and legs. I felt gun shots barraging my head as I felt 
the cold, sticky substance pouring from my head. I wouldn't leave consciousness. I was shot in the 
upper leg and it was almost blown off so a wolf of a dog took my calf from the upper leg and ripped 
it off to utilize as a dog bone. My hands were pierced long with my legs. I accepted death after I 
confessed all of my sins and forgave all those who took part in assaulting me for the sake of 
tormenting me. I forgave them all and for this I wasn't killed for their sin of brutal attempted murder 
because I came to at some point before dawn waking to the sun. The guns helicopters heavy 
machinery and emergency vehicles where gone. The people that hunted me where gone. I only 
begone to fight back when I was dying and they would leave me in peace so at that point I scared 
them off. I felt I had the right to die without spectators or any last jabs. I came of around sun up 
with scars and lacerations. I attempted to get up but realized I had one leg until it materialized at 
first like snow and then into a solid form. The wounds begun to heal before my eyes and I 
knew, that I had been reborn but to where. I looked around and God rewarded me for my blind faith 
In the truth that gods will would determine. My beat outcome and that turned out to be another 
rodeo in the earth we live in. I realized my family would be sparred of pain nod suffering from my 
assumed freakish death only described by washing sins through sacrificing myself to the savior to 
show my complete gratitude and dedication to forgiving no those who deserve it but for those who 
have black sullied souls and needed the selfless act of their victims forgiving them for their 
transgressions thus affording them another chance at a life path of redemption towards happiness. 
Instead of perpetuating bitterness and pain in a cowards mob mentality. I gave all of them a blank 
state as far as sin as I started with a blank state since I was too forgiven and reincarnated into my 
same physical body.



I really don't want anything. You almost destroyed me. We're no good for each other. You hated 
me from day one. Let me go. There's nothing we can do for one another now except you can 
know that I will love you forever in my heart. I have no way to see you. Besides I tried to come 
back so many times. You wouldn't even talk to me. Our love and what it meant to us cannot be taken 
away. I only wanted to save your life. I wasn't prepared for what you had to go through. You 
brought out the worst in me. Please forgive me for not being the person you needed. I did all I 
could. I tried so hard and it made no difference. ""What I want to know is are you kind?"" ""Ain't no 
time for hate"" I am so sorry that I hurt you. Of course I didn't create Dr. Who. Anyway I am no one 
special. You are. I also want you to know I forgive you for everything. Please realize that I 
snapped. You were too hard on me. I can never trust you again. In my heart I am at peace with 
you. Let there be peace between us. I have to let go. If you let yourself you will feel our love let it 
keep you strong, I love you farewell my dear.

The Phoenix of retribution travels from East to West evolving from fire into a spirit born to freely 
navigate the air realm on Earth to redeem evil as is presented before the mighty birds influence. 
The avian symbol represents fire to cleanse that should be eliminated from the gene pool and to 
seek opportunities to content with the end of their flesh life. A temper that makes ordinary man 
quiver as the talons and beak are ready to mince the flesh of the enemy. Pluton influence reigns yet 
the intention is retribution for those in the human realm that aren't able to protect themselves from 
an unforeseen evil. The amazing reincarnation of spirit destroys that which should not exist. When 
faced with the Phoenix man has experienced terrifying fear and in some cases has been attacked 
with death to ensue. The Phoenix looked at my husband who became filled with obscene motives as if 
his death was Imminent. As if he had crossed the line but there was something preventing his 
death. 

Two males, two females, including my husband. Tony Red and Dan violet and who else? 

I was drugged, cloaked and blood led.

I've hit this vein before (right wrist, bottom side, below the meat of the thumb), and never had any problems. Hadn't hit there in awhile so it was fresh, and with the tourney on, it was pretty easy to find.

Hit on like the second try, good register but not too strong, and the blood was the right color. As soon as I plunge some in, it burned like a motherfucker in my wrist, right at the injection site, and into my thumb. I stop right away and ended up shooting the rest elsewhere, but my thumb swelled up a decent bit (not, like, balloon-like, but enough to make it hard to bend all the way), had a sort of odd sensation that was somewhere between painful and numb, and there was a sort of white-ish patch of skin from around the injection site up to the thumb, a lot like a histamine reaction.

Now, an hour later, it's gone nearly completely back to normal, but I dunno wtf happened. I've hit an artery in my arm like twice before throughout the years, but this was different; the blood wasn't bright and slightly frothy like before, it didn't have a ton of blood pressure, and it didn't bleed like at all.

Long story short I went to every single pharmacy in town and came up empty.. I decided to give it one more day of death and try again.. Keep in mind Lope was all I had at my disposal, but I had no more luck than before. FFWD to today and I FINALLY got what I was so desperately after but for a final fuck me they only have 80 methadone and I just said fuck it I can see my Dr and get more later just give me what you got lol now I'm finally getting around to feeling normal and couldn't be happier..

Question 1: for those of you that have quite a bit of experience with PST, what unwashed seed brand have you found most effective from just going out and buying in a local Wal-Mart, Target, Walgreens, etc.? (I've read several posts stating Kroger brand, but I don't seem to have one close to where I live.) The reason for having to grab them from a local place, is that I'm planning to to purchase the seeds the next time I pick up my 30mg Oxy's and I won't have enough time to wait for a mail order to order seed online. Eventually, if this proves to be a solid method for feeling that sweet rush, I'll continue to go with order seeds or if I can find a good place locally that sells unwashed seeds.

Question 2: Which leads me to my next question. How safe is it to combine PST with my regular 30mg Oxy usage? My current tolerance is pretty high compared to what it used to be. Half a 30 would have me rocked for a while. Now, I can eat/snort 1-3 a day during the weekend, and it will mildly effect me. I heard about the teen that died from overdoing it from a pod he ordered online, so I definitely don't want to overdo it. I was thinking maybe one 30mg Oxy and the PST?

Question 3: What method do you use for preparing the PST? I've seen several methods so far, and just would like to gather more information to further solidify the methods I have seen.

I've seen an uptick in posts about this here and elsewhere so I thought I'd dump my knowledge. I've been using it daily on and off for about six months and learned a few things. Hopefully my experience can dispel some rumors and help you have a good experience.

**TL;DR**

It works. You'll need 1/2lb to 1lb of *unwashed* seeds, some lemon juice, a 2 liter bottle or a blender, and an additional cup. Its the stuff on the outside you want. Shake/blend (my blender doesn't grind the seeds) until the water looks yellow/brown (darker is better) and the seeds look like they have shed their outer coating. Strain into another glass, and gulp it down. You can expect effects in 30mins - 1hr that last significantly longer than other opiates, about 6-8hrs. Body high, sedation, strong pain killing properties, but not as euphoric compared to other opiates.

**A word on the stigma surrounding PST**

There's a site that warns of the dangers of poppy seed tea. It is scary, you've probably seen it. However the chemicals found in the system of the deceased 1. include benzodiazepenes 2. include chemicals not found in PST. From this you should first take it seriously to not combine drugs with PST. Secondly, because it contains opiates, it is possible to overdose. Start low, go slow, use common sense and you shouldn't have any problems.

**Preparation**

I won't touch on acquisition other than to say unwashed seeds are extremely important. As I mentioned above its the content on the outside of the seeds. Different manufacturers, and even different locations the manufacturers source from can vary the potency. *This is why I recommend starting with 1/2lb or less.*  That works out to be 1 cup, and so on (pretty easy, right?) When you get a new batch, you should use similar caution, should it be more potent.

**Common Recipe, with notes**

Lemon juice is used for two reasons. First, to help ""strip"" the seeds of the stuff you want, and secondly to help potentiate the chemicals in the brew. Some use real lemons, I use the bottled stuff. I give a few generous squirts, enough so that you can taste it in the tea once its made. 

I use hot water. Some say cold water, I think they get it confused with a cold water extraction. Overall, I think it isn't crucial, but I use hot water because in my experience it helps strip the seeds easier. Boiling water is thought to destroy some of the chemicals, so I only add hot tap water, as hot as your tap will go. 

The amount of water is up to you. Most recipes call for just enough water to cover all the seeds. I usually use more. This is because seeds can be washed multiple times. I find that I have to do the process fewer times if I use more water the first time. I generally eyeball the water, if there's too much however it tends to come out the top of my blender when I run it.

As I mentioned, I use a blender, it ""shakes"" the seeds vigorously and I notice it doesn't grind the seeds that much. I put the seeds in the blender, and then add a few squirts of lemon juice, and then add water. I usually run the blender for about 20 seconds. 

Leaving the seeds in longer does not make it more powerful. It releases thebaine, which will make your brew taste even worse, and increase the likelihood of nausea or vomiting. So once you have given your seeds a whirl, you should move it to a drinking vessel by pouring through a strainer. I have also used the lid of my blender as a strainer frequently. Some recommend using a 2 liter bottle to shake your seeds in, and then leaving the cap screwed on enough to let the liquid out to strain. 

Depending on how many times you wash your seeds (I say three max although it does appear that you get some chemicals in the liquid beyond three washes) you will have a good amount of liquid. I generally do as much as I can so that I'm not nauseous from the volume, wait, and continue. I've added sugar for flavoring on occasion. You may find it tastes better cold. 

**Impact**

Generally I dose with 1lb and I find it to be about 20-40mg of oxycodone. However, the experience comes on slower, lasts longer, and is more of a body high with less pronounced euphoria. I have increased the euphoria with great effect using potentiators.

**Potentiators**

Common ones apply. I personally use: 30mg DXM, 1 cup grapefruit juice, 2 tagamet (heartburn) pills. I find that taking these 30mins-1hr before consumption is best, but I still notice a difference even when I consume them a few minutes before the tea.

**Additional Notes** 
I've seen some information on reducing the liquid to increase the impact. One problem is that the chemicals are destroyed in heat. Some information points to that temperature being ~178 for morphine, some point to it being higher. I tried reducing the volume once, I used a conservative amount of liquid and still found that it was too much to reduce in any reasonable amount of time when put in my oven at 165. I also noticed it had less impact when I drank it. I'd love to hear others' experiences with reducing the amount of liquid.

On other methods of consumption - I definitely would not recommend injecting this. I have not tried a rectal administration due to the lemon juice in the recipe. Theoretically, a small amount of lemon juice could be used and this could be tried. You would still be dealing with a lot of liquid.

**Withdrawal**

Its also real, and it is a bitch. Using it once will probably not bring on withdrawals, but I imagine even a few uses will. Due to the long lasting effects of the tea, withdrawal comes on later from your last dose, and also lasts longer than most opiates. Please heed this warning, as much as I enjoy using tea, using it has put me through some periods of withdrawal, in my experience lasting a total of 96hrs with the first 48 following onset of symptoms being the worst. However, everyone is different.

I'll introduce myself...your typical 27 year old white male just living the dream. East coast, I work in accounting, single, life kind of on pause right now thanks to 2 DUIs in the last 2 years. Consequently still stuck at home with my mom. Anyhow, in relation to the sub I'm on...I've been a user/abuser of opiates for a solid 4.5 years now. Dabbled in them before in high school after a surgery and a couple times in college but nothing like now. After graduating college, I moved back home and began looking for a ""real person"" job. As I figured there was a good chance of getting drug tested, I temporarily gave up my favorite DOC, bud. I guess in an attempt to fill the void of being complete sober (didn't even drink that much anymore), I stumbled across a girl at work (part-time) whose mom was prescribed copious amounts of Perc 10s and Roxis, first the 15 mg IR and then eventually the beloved blues. Well I won't go into detail...you know where this all leads to. So basically I've been in the same cycle for nearly 5 years now after leaving college...I have a full time ""big boy"" job, make decent money, pay my bills (for the most part...) give my mama some dough, and then basically I'm left with anywhere between $350-$450 every paycheck as disposable income. I should be saving that, but it all goes to pills. I need to eventually get shit straightened out, but that's neither here nor there...maybe a different post.

So my use isn't daily, due to lack of funds and a high tolerance, but I still managed to cop something usually 3-4 times a week. My main DOC is oxycodone, usually either 15mg IR greens or 30mg IR blues. I dabble in some ECP here and there, but honestly, and I know this is probably unpopular opinion...I much prefer my precious pills. My tolerance is high...to feel atleast somewhere near where I want to be, I need atleast 80mg of oxycodone taken orally. My dose typically exceeds that though.

My thoughts/questions...

1) Does anyone else feel like they love the thrill of obtaining their DOC, almost as much as the drug itself? I especially feel like that now. I've used twice in the last 2 weeks, which rarely ever happens, but it just so happened to. I'm finally able to pick up some blues tonight...grabbing 4 and gobbling them down ASAP before I head out for trivia at a local bar. I'm just waiting on hearing from my middle-man to meet up. I almost feel high already, just the anticipation! I remember reading in Artie Lange's biography that he always felt this way too...getting the drugs is as much of a rush as doing them, sometimes. Anyone with me?

2) I have no experience with potentiation. I saw a link on here recently though that two people posted...some other website with some guy's ""guide"". Do you honestly notice a difference with some of these OTC meds? I can't imagine it makes that much of a difference, but who knows...I have no experience. That's why I ask you guys!

Sorry for the length, guys. Got a bit more talkative than I had planned (as I do when I'm high off roxis...see I'm already feeling it! haha)

I completely disagree, i dont even know if i get well from it. The histamine reaction was incredibly intense. I only shot .15 when i do .3 and my whole body turned beet red and pins and needles shot all through my body. i couldnt even tell if i was high because it hurt so bad. my hands and other parts of my body swelled up and i couldnt make a fist. normally when dope has this kind kind of reaction its bearable and goes away quick, but my hand stayed swelled for a good hour. I know i didnt hit and artery, ive done that before and this was more like a super intense morphine rush. except morphine feels okay after. this just hurt like fuck. i suspect there is leftover codiene in it or something since ive read codiene histamine raction can be deadly. i dont doubt that if i did enough of this shit my body would go into anaphylactic shock. it sucks because this is the only connect i have without having to throw people a piece to help me out. this guy has been a really good friend  of mine since 7th grade, and would have no problem fronting me, but i want to get well. im totally broke now anyway so even if i did find some opiates id be fucked. so i pose 2 questions 


has anyone ever had any tar like this?

I had a total of one rolling suitcase, carry-on size, and three paper bags just filled with random belongings of mine. I sat down and threw whatever I could away, trying to get everything I might need into my little suitcase. A man sees me and stops to ask what's wrong, do I need help, etc. Seeing an opportunity for cash, I start crying and say that I just got kicked out of my place (partial truth, lol). He offers me a place to stay. He says I can sleep in his bed with him. Great, just another perv.. and also, humorously enough, only the 4th offer I'd gotten *just since that morning* for a place to stay. Maybe I'm cynical, but I figure they all just want an easy fuck. 

Next-- the library. There's one just a few blocks away, and I know I can charge my phone and get free WiFi there. My phone bill hasn't been paid in months so it's pretty much useless unless I have WiFi. I bide my time at the library for a little while and look up the next NA meeting. I know I can probably get some help there. 

I look up directions on my phone and they seem pretty straightforward. Take BART, then it's just a 3 minute walk from there. Easy! Not. I get off at my stop and start walking. Then I realize that, actually, the NA meeting is a good couple miles away from the BART stop-- not just a 3 minute walk. So, I hop on the bus. Here I make my first huge mistake. After getting my shit back from the center, I had a grand total of one $20 bill. *I fed it to the machine at the front of the bus to pay.* Apparently, you don't get any change. Shit. It was my fault, so I don't make a big deal of it, but of course I'm beating myself up inside. Oh well.

I get to the NA meeting 20 minutes late. There, I'm able to eat a little (first thing I'd eaten all day), get a cup of hot coffee, and just chill for an hour. I share my situation, including losing my $20 on the bus, and they give me a bit of cash to help me out. Sweet. Afterwards, one of the women offer to give me a ride anywhere I might need. 

You know how some tweakers, even after years and years of sobriety, always seem like they're still tweaking??? This woman was one of them. She couldn't finish a complete sentence, was always interrupting herself, was all twitchy and jerky, and was constantly muttering to herself under her breath. Wow, I think, I'm glad I'm a junkie and not a tweaker. Haha. 

I ask her to just take me to a Starbucks I know near the TL. I had been there before and knew it closed late and was near several good ""homeless"" locations. I bought a small cup of coffee, in a medium cup, dumped out half of it, and filled the rest with half-and-half and sugar. Just how I like my coffee... mostly milk! 

I sit down, suitcase beneath the table, and my phone plugged in. It's about 8:30pm now, so I'm pretty much just biding my time until they close at 11:00pm. My phone keeps me pretty entertained. Thank God for free WiFi.

It's about an hour later now. A guy sits next to me. He starts talking to me, asking me if I'm okay, etc. I assume I must look like a complete mess at this point because people keep asking me if I'm okay. His name is Cobra... Or at least that's what he introduces himself as. Cobra seems potentially helpful, so I tell him about my situation. He says he'll show me around, introduce me to some people, make sure I'm okay. 

We just sit and chat for a little while and then, when the Starbucks workers start cleaning up, we leave and Cobra takes me to, um, a *certain location* nearby where we could sit the night away in relative peace. He keeps a lookout while I shoot up. I'm nervous, as it's my first time just slamming out in the complete open like that, but everything turns out fine and I very quickly get used to it. 

Now things actually get sortof fun. Cobra knows lots of people in the area, and random guys are coming up and saying hi and obviously feeling very sorry for me. One guy buys me a hot chocolate and a salad to eat. I'm getting free hits on pretty much everybody's meth and crack pipes. They're talking about taking turns sitting with me and making sure I get through my first night okay. A couple people come by looking for clean points and I was happy to oblige. This turns out to be a good decision on my part, as it earned me a stamp of approval. One of them.

I meet Robert, a man in his 50's with a debilitating stutter. But he seems nice. He's the one who bought me hot chocolate and a salad. Danielle is nice too-- I gave her a clean point to use. She tells me where she's staying nearby and says I can stop by any time to shower or clean up if I need. And finally, James, a paranoid tweaker who keeps talking about various government conspiracies. I like James. He's my favorite. 

Eventually I start to drift off to sleep. Cobra scoots closer to me and I can feel his hand drifting up my thigh. I'm not sure why he thinks he's being so sneaky, as I'm obviously not asleep yet and I keep brushing his hand away. But he keeps trying. Eventually I just say ""Stop!"" and he apologizes and says it was ""an accident."" Right. Okay. 

A few hours later, I've gotten hardly any sleep, but the sun is starting to come up. It's time to move-- the police will start coming by around 5:00am to clear people out of the area, or so I'm told. I made it through my first night just fine, made a bunch of friends, and was high as a kite the whole entire time. Being homeless isn't so bad, right?

I had reconstructive knee surgery a year ago, as a result I not only still have pain and issues in my bad knee, but also I experience pain in my good knee due to the increased stress I had to put on it prior to and after my surgery. 

Additionally, I snapped my collarbone in a skiing accident this past winter. I couldn't afford surgery and as a result the bone fused back together but in such a way that I lost roughly 1-1.5in. of my collarbone.

I am nervous about going in to my primary care doctor and inquiring about pain management options. Should I go to my primary care doctor? Should I visit an orthopedic specialist at the local hospital? Should I seek out a pain clinic?

And of course just the general pain that can occur later on in life when being operated on, the type of pain that will make you want to kill your doctors and nurses in a fit of animal rage. This is exacerbated by things getting infected, things being yanked out, etc... etc...


When I think about all the really horrible times I could end up having if I make it to old age, one thing is for sure, I want a shitload of IV Benzo and Opiate in me at all times. I want to be high as fuck, and able to get high as fuck, for all those horrible days ahead.

I've definitely met a few old addicts who had stories of having to have back surgery, or emergency surgery after a car accident, and how they felt EVERYTHING, and could not sleep. No matter how much Morphine drip you give someone who smokes 80mg oxycontin in one sitting, its not gonna be enough.

So if there is one reason I can point to that has made it easy for me to leave opiates alone, its that right there, I want my low tolerance late in life.

... and it was a decently sized (0.3 + 0.5ish) belushi (cocaine/#4) after a whole nights binge-snortig coke after a really nice dinner with some cavaas a welcome drink, (free!)beer, (sort of free-ish, bought it for unexpected/unbudgeted/uncalculated with  money ) a quiet expensive (‚Ç¨75-85ish) wine - awesomely tendered, perfectly seasoned and marinated bbq on wood charcoal for 6-7 minutes (medium-rare to medium, mediim we√∂√∂ if the pieve is tjoclet than 2,0-3,5cm (metric for the win!) tops. 

Btw, there is a tldr about 2/3 or 3/4 down, but even that one is to long. 

Oh my God I'm derailing completely. I need a fucking awesome BJ by an expert, 10-20mg of diazepam and/or 2-4mg of xanax and a dark room, cozy bed  (prefer with someone I care for and that lines to cuddle and provide BJs every other hour or so until I'm awake enough to do something more advanced. ;-P ) - and no phones, alarms or jobs. Just two more days until vacation though. It will be awesome slacking , not caring what. Who, where you are doing and so on for 6 weeks in a row (I know,  crazy vacation laws plus a week's bonus paid vacation  (25 days lawfully unless negotiated otherwise, 5 paid  additional days from the company) . Imagine 6 weeks of (moderately high paid) vacation, you can do whatever you want, you still get your normal salary/paycheck as usual plus additional % per day because you have vacation!!! 

I'm  detraled again, it might have something to do that I just fucking shot a speedball in my neck,  alone,  in a  bathroom at work where Noone would find me for weeks/days during the vacation-period (we are down to like 5-10% total work force which will decline wven further next week (Friday))! Wow. Wall of text. 

Anyway, TL;DR
Shot/stabbed/injected myself in my neck (front left throat vein, huge!) for the first time EVER, oddly enough I shot a moderately strong belushi  speedball (felt the dope through the Coce even, rush-wise, and I've been doing coke pretty much non-stop since 4pm yesterday, weds, it's Thursday now),  stupidly enough at work which had less than 10% of the people on site due to vacations and even less since it is so early, relatively speaking. 

IT WAS AWESOME 11/10, will do again. In about 2h though and stick to snorting cocaine, cocaine / you are my main, mistress / cocaine, cocaine / you are my love / cocaine? Are you there?/ (orchestra comes in with decent tenor) nay, my weet little one / I'm not what you truly / truly^/ love. 

You need the heroin but you want the cocaine / your body hurts you when you don't have the hit ready / the ringing of bells have no appeal without it's pillar / you are and will forever be , in love with me/ I am your master,  mistress, love and life...


Oh shot. Derailed Again! I started writing this post at 4:15am, it is now 8:14am. I am going to take a final hit from my bullet and get going. I'm not going to apologize for long fucking crazy, coked up, sleep deprived post like this. It belongs here.  Even if I've used 3g of coke and only 1.5g of dope so far I still use dope more regularly than coke  (2/4 times per year,  opiates is a daily thing).

I'm moving back to the city in a month. Anyway, haven't really minded it until I started seeing someone. I'm living in a beach town so summers are crowded and busy but during the winter, it's a ghost town and rent is cheap. Because of this, the guy I'm seeing, we'll call him B, lives at home during the summer. He has his own place for 9 months out of the year. 


Anyway, I'm getting really frustrated because I can't bring this guy home and I guess B feels the same way. We've been hanging out in random places, usually a cool spot in the woods or at the beach. We can chill, smoke, and make out without worrying about anyone. However, I'm really getting the female equivalent of blue balls. Do you guys have any ideas on other things we can do besides hanging outside 24/7. I don't mind, I could talk with this guy for hours but it's just starting to get old. I feel lke I'm 16. 


I guess there aren't very many options, I'm just venting. Can't wait until his parents go on vacation or I get my new place next month.",1436995323.0

Started off at taking 20-30 Mg a day, and needed 40-50 mg just to get high when I stopped Monday. I've been taking a couple heaping spoonfuls of Kratom twice daily, around 4 gabapentin a day, Ativan in the morning and before bed, with pepto bizmo for the shits and Advil to help with the pain. 

This has been the easiest withdrawal I've ever had, shitting solid, eating, and sleeping at night. I still get hot and cold flashes all day but I find a slurpie helps a ton haha. Just thought I'd share this combo with you guys cause it's been amazing. On day three and I'm getting by just fine...... Can't wait to relapse again lol.

So basically I'm back to using a piece of cotton ball to try to get at least 50% of the microcrystalline cellulose from causing capillary blockages and shit before it settles permanently in my lungs, but that's just more of my ""the universe is so unfair"" talk because even when you do everything right, you still get pissed on and might as well share dirty rigs of pond water.

Anyways, this marks the 3rd time this year she has threw away a 100 count box before I could finish it off (twice this month), so after getting a few extra uses out of my girlfriend's dirty needles, bless her junkie heart, I broke down and hit up Wal-Mart for 100-pack number 3 for the month.

Now, it freaks me out when they take my ID and write shit down, like, full out junkie paranoia that the police will come knocking on my door demanding to see my prescription for insulin, because while VA isn't a prescription-required state, we have to sign a log book, sign our name, verify our address, and certify that we're using it for insulin, and it *is* a misdemeanor to lie about the intended purpose in this log book. 

I can't find any information about it, nothing on auditing procedures, frequency, duration of record keeping, anything, and I always worry about it but sign anyways because it's a law that you have to sign for syringes in VA, but the most I can see on Google is accounts of people telling new IV users that you'll have to bring your ID and should just buy online instead if it worries you. 

So does anyone know any solid information on these logbooks? For all the research you guys know I do, I just cannot find any solid information besides speculation like ""oh it's not a big deal"" and ""well most government records probably get trashed every two years"" :/",1436983823.0

My poison of choice is Roxy 30's (""Blues"", ""perc30's"", ""Rox"", etc). Preferred method of delivery is right up the ol' nasal.  I'm not crazy picky but I have come to enjoy one brand more than another in most case.  My rankins would have to go as follows:
K9's
A-215
V's
M-Boxes
RP30's -- yuck.

I like the K9 and A215s because they're smaller, easier to crush, pleasant drip, and are rarely fakes.
The V's are not around as often but these are what originally got me hooked into the game... so big time nostalgia factor.
M's aren't so bad, a little thicker, not as clean of a break when you want to bust one in half, and these are what I have found to usually be the fakes that are floating around.
RP's.... I just don't know what to say.  They're new, from Rhodes Pharmaceutical.  They're almost 3.5x the size of an M, with equal amount of oxy.  This means more filler.  Hard to break up, cannot break in a straw for easy access.  Just an overall cringe thinking about my neighborhood pharmacist pulling a bag of these out.

how bout y'all?  Let's hear your preferences and hopefully start a helpful discussion for those now and in the future!
