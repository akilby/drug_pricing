My side of the story.,"First, I want to start by saying that I have never consumed any type of drugs in my entire life. (dont worry, I did not come here to preach, much less I'm going to ask you to stop using, I respect you and your decisions) but wanted to tell you a bit about myself and how this subreddit change my perception of the world.

A few months ago, by mere chance I found this subrredit and felt incredibly curious. While browsing stories and memes I found myself laughing and crying from situations I couldnt relate and that I hardly understood which baffled me.

You have to know that I come from a country that has suffered unceasingly due to drug trafficking. I bet if I told you the name, you would immediately associate it with drug trafficking (No, it's not mexico lol.)

When I was little my father was a prominent farmer, and for many years he was approached by narco-terrorist groups that wanted to ""buy"" his land to plant poppy and coca. They also planned to set up labs to manufacture many types of drugs including heroin. 

My father that had some massive balls refused their offer. This was a very brave but not very smart move and resulted in multiple muerder attempts. Things finally got so bad that we were forced to move across the country and loose almost everything we had. 

Since that day I hated drugs with all my heart, but for some reason I blamed users more than I blamed narcos. In my mind, consumers were the reason why all of this was happening  to me and I blamed you for years. 

But against all odds, after reading some amazing stories and some very sad ones I felt the struggle and understood the many reasons that drive people to addiction and suddenly I could relate, and felt sympathy...

So even if this subrredit for you its just a safe space to share your experiences and laugh a little. For me its a very humane, tolerant and warm community full of amazing people just dealing with life the best they can. You showed me another perspective I've never considered before and helped me overcome my judgemental mindset.

Sometimes there is no wrong or right or better or worse or black and white. Finally we are all just people trying to find happiness in this shitty world.  

So from the bottom of my heart thank you. Be safe. ",1524580210.0

I sent my sub doctor a picture of my face and x-rays, and she said to take WHATEVER I needed to help with the pain, and if whatever the ER gave me wasn't strong enough she'd give me something else.

So I was prescribed 30mg codeine pills. 2 pills 4 times a day. 

Today I called the doctor and said they weren’t working and he told me it is safe to double my dose. So I’m on 12 pills a day which will make my supply run out quicker (which was my intention. The supply only lasts me 2 days in reality) 

So I have 3-4 days left until I can go back but I was wondering if anyone thinks it’s a good idea to request the 60mg tablets after being told I can double the dose if the pain is still unbearable.

Tell me what to do!,"Soooooo...(settle in, kinda long) I helped out a friend that lost their job very unexpectedly and unfairly, having nothing whatsoever to do with their heroin habit. I know what happens when u lose a job as a junkie and no savings to cover ur daily habit, you go downhill fast and finding and keeping a new job is nearly fucking impossible. So I agreed to take care of them while they looked for a new job and started having money coming back in. They got a holiday job quickly and after that a permanent job immediately, both jobs well paying. Their current job pays $16- $17 an hour and is full-time. Their living expenses are minimal, no rent, no kids, no SO, but car needs a lot of upkeep. 
     Well, as I'm sure u have guessed, their bill has sky rocketed and they are less than diligent paying me back. I even charge them the lowest amount possible for the work they get. I should mention that on the scale of friends from 1 to 10, 10 being like damn near family, lifelong homie, help hide a body for each other friend, this person was about a 4-5 when I started helping them out. Not sure where they currently fall on the scale. We've stayed in constant communication, at one point I tallied up their bill, gave them another big discount and a reasonable payment deadline, they agreed to all of it but ultimately only repaid 70% of what they should have. Currently they owe a few thousand, we don't have a payment schedule in place, just a lot of talk about needing to get it taken care of, start lowering the bill and start lowering their usage level, lots of talk but no real action.
     Here's the problem, throughout this entire time they have kept up an active social life, no problem, I didn't expect or want them to become a hermit. However I recently got wind of an upcoming trip to a tropical location, a mutual friend informed me but they didn't know exactly when this trip was happening. So tonight, when I saw them for their daily dose, they gave me some story about a last minute, out of town trip for a family medical situation (non-emergency). They will be gone from tomorrow afternoon until Thursday, maybe Friday and could I give them in one chunk what they would normally get over all those days? Now I know they have told me stories and lies to justify why they haven't paid me more, problems with their paycheck, unexpected car issues etc...the normal junkie Bullshit but a straight up, only for fun, tropical vacation that they don't even tell me honestly about, really pissed me off. So now I gotta decide if this so-called family medical trip is for real or just another lie. Do I keep helping or leave them high and fucking dry? What would you guys do? I'm not hurting for money at the moment, but I don't like paying for other people's habits and I really fucking hate it when people think they are getting away with something when in fact I know what's up but choose not to confront them with it.

I just played one when I was a junkie.,"We stole a pack of shaving razors, a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, some gauze and tape.  I broke the thin blade out of one of the shavers and snapped it in half.  In the poorly lit bathroom she stood in the tub, while I knelt on the floor outside of it.  Danielle shook, and her lips curled in distress.  With her right wrist in my left hand I looked at her and said with a smile,

“Now baby, I know that I look like one, but I feel like I should tell you that I’m not actually a doctor.”

“Shut up!  It’s not funny!  Now hurry up!”

I pushed the sharp side of the blade into the thin, yellowed skin on the head of her abscess.  A snake of black blood and green puss slithered down her arm and thudded in clumps on the floor by the drain.  She recoiled, but I held her wrist and pulled her back.

“Now, we have to squeeze it.”  I pinched her flesh on either side of the bleeding wound and squeezed it.  More blood and puss oozed out.  Her body shuddered, and she groaned curse words.  We were high on heroin, but it didn’t make much difference for her.  It was painful.  I poked a hole into the top of the bottle of peroxide and sprayed a jet of the fluid into her wound.  It fizzed and foamed on the blood.

“Okay.  That should be good.”  We wrapped the wound in gauze and taped it up and went to sleep.

The next night we went up to the strip club where she had worked a couple of years before. After 15 minutes of my waiting in the car, she walked out fuming and cursing back at one of the bouncers, and he screamed from across the parking lot that she was a junkie whore.  They did not want her back with a bandage on her arm like that.  So, we headed back to the town we met in.

I wasn’t afraid of the death threats there, because if there was anything I knew about that town, it was that no one’s word was worth much.  The people who wanted to kill me would have to find me first, and even if they did, they would have to deal with me when they did.  I’m not saying that they weren’t dangerous people.  They were, but what I am saying is that when it came down to it, so was I.

Been on the rocks lately and wondering should I explode.,Ok everyone. Me and my boyfriend where like best friends back in 2013. We started shooting up and thing turned into a bromance and than dating. I would suck his dick at night but he wanted to keep it in the down low but things where becoming transparent. Well I talked to one of my old trap buddy not to long ago and he brought up the time we all where sitting in a car. And one of my other friends named Sam texted my Kevin (boyfriend) said hey come pick me up and smoke a blunt and like me also suck that dick. Got into a big fight with sam and we all got over it. But I would get mad at Kevin for hanging out with him alone. Now Sam had all the plugs to the dope and the excuse was always like I was getting dope. Than my birthday rolled again last week and I basically broke up with Kevin. Long stupid story. I talked to my old trap buddy about it and he said he was always sneaky. I asked him what he meant by all of this. He said a couple of years ago when I was away at rehab. My buddy was at a friends house and Kevin texted his friend and said he wanted to give him head and also sent a dick pic. But my friend said it seemed like it was meant for someone else. Now I’ve always had a feeling that Kevin was cheating on me a couple of times but I couldn’t prove it. Now I’m trying to get in contact with this Zack kid and figure it out.

I have used opiates before, but nothing major. Just codeine, tramadol, kratom. Is there a safe way to use these patches at all, or should I forget about it altogether?

So I havn't been muslim all my life, just more recently (shit gets weird when your immediate family is 1/2  arab 1/2 latino growing up, so I got 1/2 Christian 1/2 Muslim lol). I'd say like 4-5 years.


My question is how do you deal our obligations? Like prayer x times a day (I know the answer to that, probably the same as mind, you'd like to do it more, but you just don't for x reason), Friday prayer, and Ramadan (as it's approaching).


On methadone it was simple, get to the clinic at 4 AM, wait an hour till 5 when they opened, dose within 4 minutes to avoid doing after Fajr.  And I only smoked bud at night.

I plan to not use at all that month, as I'm planning another break (I tend to use for 2 months, break for 2, repeat), but I'm curious how a stronger user would cope all day? 

So, I'm curious, are you like me, who will absolutly not step foot inside a Masjid if I'm high? I've gone to jummah sick as a dog, and then copped. I just feel it horribly disrespectful to do so high, but that's just my opinion.

IMO religion is a relationship between you and God, so there are no right or wrong answers, I'm just curious what bros/sis take on this, since I can't ask anyone at the masjid....


""Salam Imam! Is it permissible to shoot heroin before Jummah? or is it haram?!""

I’m going to have to change my name from BatMeth to BatNod.. because wow. I’ve never felt anything so blissful in my life. 

I’ve had plenty of experience with oxy. From 15-60mg doses. But most of them ended in nausea and were overall unpleasant. I was also out and about for all of them, not relaxing to enjoy the high.. maybe that’s why I never really liked it.

I just got some ER Targin. 10mg Oxycodone and x amount Naloxone. Crushed and parachuted 30mg. I expected to puke due to little if any tolerance. so I sat down. For the first hour, total euphoria! No discomfort whatsoever. And then.. it happened. I was sitting there, and every 10 seconds my head would start to fall to one side, and the sound of my jacket rubbing would snap me back into consciousness. 10 seconds later, same thing. Total bliss! For a moment I was worried I’d had too much, and that I should avoid sleep at all costs.. but that’s just because I’ve never experienced this before. 20 minutes in, and each ‘sleep’ started to last a bit longer, maybe 10 seconds. Each with a different ‘dream’. I was dreaming, but I was awake, but I wasn’t.. then I’d snap out of it, drift off again, and have a different dream. Throughout this, my entire body is so warm. Emotionally, I feel fantastic. Worry free. Just.. perfectly content. (Is this actually what’s referred to as nodding?)

Overall, 10/10 experience. Would take this over meth any day of the week. 

Part of me wants to flush the rest.. because I already know if I keep going I’ll end up hooked.

So all I’ve been able to find lately is shitty ass scramble. This shit burns the hell out of my nose and barely gets me high.

Yesterday I met up with a dealer that I got from waiting in a parking lot for another dealer... lol.

He’s been selling me ‘uncut’ rocks. Obviously they’re cut to some extent, but he just doesn’t cut it himself again into shitty ass scramble with tons of Benadryl or whatever it is.

So he made me come all the way through yesterday and wait a while only to admit he doesn’t have any on him. 

Started to sketch me out when him and his friend (I barely know either) jumped into my whip and told me to drive to get it.

When we got down the street, he asked to use my phone and called like 3 of his hookups.

Finally a dude answered and was surprisingly right down the street. He pulled up in literally 5 seconds.

I could tell immediately when I looked at this dude that he was older and has been in the game for a while. I knew that this is who all the small-time dealers were copping from before they cut their shit.

I was overcharged baaaad. Sold me 4 points for like 75 bucks :/
The shit was greeeeat though.

Buuuut today I realized the number was left in my phone. And another post gave me courage to just call him and say I got from him yesterday.  I didn’t want him to tell my other guy that I was being sketchy.

But it was a success... and of course he’ll sell that same great shit for a much cheaper price.

Finally got a good hookup close by :’)

So funny how this happened... met him through having met four other dealers randomly while waiting in parking lots / calling numbers left in my phone.

Cheers guys! This stuff is nice, light tan rocks for $15 a point. Usually prices here are like $10 a tenth instead but this stuff is waaaaay better and I don’t mind paying it.

Super stoked (•‿•)

Called the number one of my dealers left in my phone. Now I have a hookup to the good dope before it’s cut again!",1524495992.0

So here's what's going on - 
Ive been informed by my work that I've got a mouth swab that has to be taken. I could have taken it last Friday, but they gave me the option of that or sometime this coming week, so naturally I chose the latter. Now, I smoke pot daily, and sniff h daily. About .2-.4 per day. Stopping smoking weed for a week won't be a problem, but that's not the one I'm worried about. 

My question to all of you is: 
How can I pass this test while being uncomfortable for the shortest possible time frame? If I need to take Kratom or Lope or some other withdrawal lessening substance, I'm more than open to suggestions. Wasn't able to acquire any subs. I have on hand Gabapentin and trazadone as well, don't think those will show up on the test.

 I have to swab my my mouth and then leave the swab in for five minutes. The swab will then be sent to a lab. So basically, I want tips regarding all stages and aspects of this. 

Tldr: swab test this week. When should I take it, what should I abstain from and for how long, and how can I suffer as little as possible from withdrawals while still passing.

A few months ago I splurged $25 and bought a gram of an opioid known as methoxyacetylfentanyl, or MAF. This drug produces a deliciously warm five hour buzz. It's also exceptionally potent - just one tenth of a milligram is equivalent to a few bags of street heroin, and there are one thousand milligrams in one gram.  

For the mathematically impaired among us, that's ten thousand strong doses, enough to get a solid nod every evening for a decade.  

So naturally, I used all ten thousand doses within three months and then went into a horrific withdrawal.  

Or did I? Well, I did go into a horrific withdrawal, but what about the MAF being gone? Oh, I definitely poured the last of the crystal residue from the baggie and made quick work of it, that's unquestionable. But there must have been a hundred invisible doses stuck to the sides of the baggie and I can't recall any bag-scraping for the life of me. Try as I might, I cannot dredge up the memory of doing anything with that 'empty' bag. Surely I didn't throw it away?  

It's almost midnight at the moment so I can hardly tear up my room trying to find this baggie, but tomorrow morning I'm going to flip everything upside down and get to the bottom of this mystery.

Either that, or made to jump through countless hoops in order to secure the medication they are rightly entitled to.

I can only read articles and watch documentaries. I have no first or second hand knowledge on this topic. Could I ask my fellow Redditor‘s across the pond; is this actually a big problem in the US?

My first post over in this sub. As the title says, my BF of 2 months told me last week that he's been moderately addicted to oxycodone for the past 8 months following a very harrowing near-death experience that almost cost him his life and he was prescribed them for pain management.

He's been buying them off the street. This in itself terrifies me. 

We had a few troubles in our relationship and when I called him out about it, he got really reactive and we didn't speak for 2 weeks. He confessed his addiction to me on this past Thursday, and I was floored. Like, floored. I had no idea. I've never been involved with someone who was addicted to anything other than booze or pot (not sheltered, just careful) and looking back, I realized that it explained a lot of his behaviours.  He has told me that he hasn't used since the day we broke up, because he was ashamed of the way he'd been acting and how much he hurt me.

My question to you is this: What are some of the typical ""signs"" of oxy use that I should be on the lookout for in case he slips or was just plain lying to me? Everything I've read online was very generalized, i.e. ""mood swings"". This is a strange situation for me since he has been high every time I've seen him. I don't know what his ""normal"" self is like without the oxy.

I did read a bit about the aftermath of getting off it, and yeah, those symptoms sound a lot like what he was going through when I saw him on Saturday.  He was wrecked but looked better than I've seen him. He was in good spirits, if a bit distracted. His belly wasn't happy with him and he was sick a few times. He hasn't been sleeping well and would alternate between being very hot to shivering, covered in goosebumps. He didn't have any flu or anything; I am sure it was his body freaking the fuck out from not having his fix.

Any advice or help you could give would mean a lot to me. I just want to help him get better, and it says a lot to me that I was the catalyst for his change. He's not doing it FOR me; he's doing it BECAUSE of me.",1524480475.0

I was invited by some old classmates to barbecue at their place last weekend. I was surprised and decided to go since it was a welcome distraction from just studying for my finals and shooting, without much social interaction.





When we all sat together the conversation turned to the recent death of that DJ guy, aviici. So they started joking about how heroin was healthier than alcohol and that he might be alive if he had opted for heroin instead of alcohol. Not factually wrong, but I bet you know those jokes along the lines of 'haha, it's funny to say heroin because it's so absurd to shoot heroin'. They went on for while like 'oh, yeah, you could shoot some heroin, it's not that bad, lololol'. I felt super uncomfortable and when I left I couldn't really pinpoint why I felt *so* uncomfortable. Tbh I got a little paranoid and thought they were laughing at me tho they don't even know I use. They know I used to have a drug problem when I was younger bc I came straight from an inpatient treatment when I was added to the class. 



Being brutally honest, my thought process was even weirder. I had a best girlfriend in that class who had the bad habit of sleeping with/going after guys I was involved with. Because she was comfy around them after I introduced them (her reasoning lol). After she spread her legs for my just-ex and lying to me about it, things went really sour and I plunged into the worst depression of my adult life. They still are together, I think. Also some other stuff happened that made shit worse for me. I may or may not have threatened to maybe overdose because she had been a bad fwiend. Yes, super cringe. And I thought, maybe she told them I was using dope and they invited me to verify that. How fucking stupid can I be? Why does my brain work like that? 




So instead of figuring out these insecurities by myself and questioning my sick social paranoia, I texted one of the guys I used to be close friends with in school and *asked why I was invited*. I cringe so hard just saying this. Like, what if he asked why I would even say that? Should I say that I couldn't imagine anyone inviting me and spending time with me voluntarily without an ulterior motive? That I think it intuitively more likely that people hate me and want to ridicule me? Argh! What did I even expect when I wrote this? I don't know, I can't stop thinking about it. And I wish I could say something to take away the weirdness of the question. But there really isn't anything that would make me look any less weird and stupid. (If you have an idea though, I'd be eternally grateful.) 




Do you know that social paranoia? Always thinking 'THEY KNOW!' and in turn acting super irrationally? And even without thinking they know I'm a user - social interaction gets always super weird for me. 





Just kill me please. I don't know man, every time I try to rebuild my social life I get so freaking paranoid and fuck shit up because I feel so uncomfortable being me that I can't imagine anyone liking to be around me.





If I didn't have some dope atm to keep me calm I know would fuck up my exams too. So, praise Junkie Jesus my mom lend me some money to balance my credit card. Praise the Lord for poppies, because without, if not I, the cringe would fucking kill me. 


Hope the fam is safe and well.




TLDR: I asked someone why they did invite me because I'm an absolute socially handicapped idiot. And thanks for heroins, because if not for heroins the cringe at myself would kill me. ",1524468022.0

Multiple people (even including doctors) have said ""you don't need naloxone...if you did they wouldn't even put it in your medication in the first place.""  Even after explaining naloxone does NOTHING orally/bucally their mentality is that I have all the naloxone I need in pill form and if that's not enough then I shouldn't be on Suboxone in the first place.  I even have the mindset that both people and doctors are absolute and utter f*cking morons when it comes to helping to save a life just because they are completely in the dark or have no care when it comes to people in my predicament.  My primary doctor will not write the prescription, my emergency dept. won't, and the only way to obtain naloxone is by walking into a pharmacy and slapping down $170 for a SINGLE DOSE KIT.  Why should we have to pay that much for one dosage when a single vial and sterile needle costs 1/20th of that?

I've searched for over a month trying to get my hands on one or two naloxone vials as I already have my sharps (I also am on test for medicinal purposes and never inject a single milligram more than I'm allowed - nor do I have the desire).  I've went to the county clinic trying to obtain a single prescription and they refuse to budge on the grounds that ""there are people that need naloxone much worse than you do"" solely because I'm already in recovery and I'm the only person that matters because I've been able to get this far in life in spite of my addictions.  I already know with a prescription, my health insurance, and/or GoodRx I can purchase two 2mg vials for less than $20 out the door and if it means saving mine or someone else's life then I gladly pay it - getting my hands on the vials/amps are a different story however.

Are there resources available that would perhaps allow someone with a preexisting addiction receive a prescription for naloxone, even if every pharmacy in our area will sell naloxone OTC for $170 for a single dose?  I've called my town hall, been to city meetings, and done everything I know how to do and haven't been able to find someone that would be able to help and I can't jeopardize my own integrity just to ""cop some naloxone.""  If there are some ideas others have used before to get a prescription for it, consider me all ears because I've experienced first (and second) hand what this antidote can do for people about to overdose.  You'd think being in the heartland of opiate addiction a plea for help would be heard with open ears but there aren't many people advocating for myself or the others in my area so I feel like it has to start somewhere.  Any ideas, tips, or recommendations would be highly welcome.  Thank you very much.",1524462416.0

I can't fucking keep taking so much Hydro. The APAP is toxic as shit and I don't know anyone that has a better alternative.

Sublingual ROA is by far my preference. I'm torn between sublingual and buccal. I humbly consider myself a pro as far as the technique but I'm never above advice.  I recently started heating the patch under a lighter just before administering under the tongue. DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE AN INSANE TOLERANCE!! I got to the point of 100mcg patches not satisfying my thirst. This technique will knock your socks off, trust me. The first time I did it I thought I was toast. I want to hear you guys' personal techniques and tips, maybe I can pick up on something.

If you do decide, which I DO NOT CONDONE, be very cognizant of the following:

Pull up the hard plastic film (touch the sticky side as little as possible) and grab it on the very tip of one of the corners with a pair of tweezers. Remove it completely from the plastic, turn the patch horizontally with the sticky side up (facing the ceiling) and start about a foot over the flame. Once you notice the heat causing the patch to rise and flutter hold it still. The sticky side will start to glaze over and seem wet. Be super careful! Angle your eye to where you can see the flame through the patch so you can monitor the texture. If you notice the patch start to go transparent from the outer edge inward STOP. This is a no-no, you're too close to the flame and burning up the medication rendering the patch useless. The sweet spot is when you see it super glossy and glazed over all-the-while maintaining the blurry transparency the patch originally had. Once you get it right pop it under the tongue or in between  the gum and cheek. It takes alot of practice and finesse but when you get it right...GOT-DAMN! Be somewhere comfy because you're going down for the count on Unicorn Island son!

Use your head. Know your limits and be damn sure you have a friend around in case it's too potent. That's not going to happen though because you're smart enough to know not to try this! ;P

Oh and I do this with cut up pieces of the patch. Not the entire patch. Use your head.",1524431754.0

This could go in two other subs as well but I love you guys the most and I know many of you have been where I am so here goes...,"First of all I’m 20 months free from heroin. And I’m pretty fucking proud of that. However during those 20 months I was drinking and doing the occasional sub and a line of blow here and there. I told myself no big deal bc the real monster is the opiates. And then while I was stealing some of my mothers pain pills I justified it that heroin is my real problem. 

I’ve had a lot of problems due to my use. I’ve been to 8 treatment facilities and incarcerated 8 or so times (I don’t think I was coherent a few of them so it may be more). Anyways, I just faced some pretty serious legal consequences and managed to avoid prison and instead completed a one year intensive outpatient program (and by intensive I mean 5 days a week 8 hrs a day - 45 min to an hr drive from my house). It was exhausting but I felt great that I did it. This time though I didn’t go to meetings. I didn’t get a sponsor. (And I won’t in the future so please no AA/NA is the only way types bc that not true.) I basically just showed up to group bc I was legally required to. But hey I finished it. Never completed a program in my life. So... go me. To that rehabs credit though they focused on my mental health disorder PTSD and that was amazing help. 

Fast forward a bit I ended up suffering a miscarriage a few months ago. I didn’t even think I could have kids so I was so excited just to be devastated w the loss. But I got through it -clean. 

Something just clicked in me and I don’t feel the need to always non stop think about getting high. I missed so much good stuff in my life doing that. I just feel like I’m over it. I’m too tired to go running around like that again. Staying high everyday is tough work (and people call junkies lazy- bitch please I worked my ass off every day to feed my habit. Granted it wasn’t ethical work or contributing to society but it was work and it sucked and I’m grateful I made it through that.) I’m too old and tired to go through all this again. 

I just got back from an extended visit w my significant other. He lives in another state and has a great job and is moving to my state just to be w me. I am so blessed. He is so sweet to me. Like one of those guys that I’m positive will love me for me forever. My penguin. However,  the visit was great and all but he’s a medical professional (DO) and he doesn’t drink. Doesn’t party. Goes to bed at 9pm wakes up at 4am. He’s an amazing human being and I don’t understand why he lives me like he does. 

Anyways on my trip I was alone in his house all day long. Bored af. It was cold af so there was no going for walks. He has one car and it’s a stick which I can’t drive so I was stuck in the house all day long. Bored af. So. Of course I peruse Reddit for hours on end. Specifically the heroin opiates and cocaine subs. I used to do this just to try and offer support to people like “hey I’m a complete fuck up and I did it you can too”  “Did it” to me means no heroin no shiesty behavior and basically I’m alive not a zombie and around my family and friends now. 

Okay here’s the problem. I started talking to a friend kind of romanticizing how great and eight ball of crack and 30 Oxus would be. Then I was looking at those drug subs all day. Triggered af but stubborn and tough so no big deal I tell myself. Then I get a msg from an old dealer that he’d just like to “see” me. Mmmhmm. I was about to entertain the idea when I decided if I’m gonna do it I’m not getting involved w a dealer. I’ll call a friend and just go party one night and that’s it leave. Well this particular friend and I used to smoke a ton of crack together. I thought I would go over there, we’d do a few hits, go to dinner, then blamo I’m outta there. 

Guys I get to my friends house and he looks like a shell of his former self. Gaunt, can’t remember things for a conversation, tells me the military just deemed him 100% disabled. He’s a combat vet. (W an arsenal of guns in his room. And I mean arsenal. I’m all for gun rights but I think we need to look into the people w serious mental health disturbances but I’m on a tangent)

Moving on. This dude in the almost two years since I’ve seen him has become a crack smoking aficionado. Has a box of special order pipes to his specs. 1000 per box. 3 types of chore boy. Stem holders that double as coolers. 100 bic lighters. Scale that measures to the  .0001. Huge glass jar filled of hard. 7gs to be exact. I almost couldn’t speak it was like heaven and hell at the same time. We ended up smoking it all. I was shaky and felt weird bc I’ve never smoked without heroin to level me out. He gave me some kpins. Thank God. 

He goes to bed. I try to sleep. Made it an hour. Came back upstairs and pushed the fuck out of every pipe we used. My fingers were black from that oily chore. Gross. I don’t want to live like this I just keep going through the motions though. 

He won’t wake up and it was like 11am. Time to get up bud I’ve been up all night. I tell him we need to go get more before I have to go home tonight bc I have regular life Monday that I’m certainly not fucking up. He won’t get up. I get pissed (why? I dunno bc once a junky always a junky and I wanted more) So my genius idea is to go cop myself from the guy that sent me that msg. I kept him in my Facebook “just in case.” (Please no levtures about all we have to change is everything bc as I stated above I’ve been to rehab A LOT.) So I go meet Justin Case and get more hard and he throws me a “tester” of boy.  When I got back I weighed it and it was a fucking half g. For free. Trying to pull me back in. 

I did a line. Bc I’m weak. It was amazing. I’m all warm and fuzzy but I know that’s just heroin  lying. That’s how it gets you hooked into slavery.  Point of my story. I do not want this to be the day I throw everything away (just the heroin in my pocket) I’m not going down that road ever again. I got a preview- it still sucks- I’m still out. 

I can’t believe I did this. But at the same time I’m not gonna wallow around about losing my clean time. When people make mistakes they acknowledge them and move on. Too many times I’ve relapsed and went on a two year bender bc I was so ashamed. So what. I fucked up. I’m handling it. I’m still me and I’m still awesome. I’m still claiming my date bc that’s the day I really began to fight and took my life back. I give zero fucks if anyone disagrees w that. It’s not like I’m gonna stand up at a meeting and say “Hi my name is so and so and I’ve been clean 20 months.” I don’t go to meetings and I’ll live my life how I want. 

I had an abusive controlling ex who died of an overdose and now I currently reside w my abusive mother and I’m tired of being put down. I’ve done it to myself. Others do it. I’m tired of it. Yeah I shouldn’t have done that. But when people make mistakes they shrug em off n keep going. 

❤️

TLDR ended up getting a free half g from a dboy, threw it away (did a line), still consider myself awesome bc I’m not jumping into that nightmare again. 

Also if your sober and have idle hands, stay outta the drug subs kids. If you must go go for support or help and don’t spend hours salivating over drug porn. Learn from me. Ms. FuckUpUSA. And you know what- I’m damn proud of it.

The other day my plug called and said she had a kpack if percs going for 50 cents a pop. I linked her and she showed me twenty in a dime bag and the rest were vacuum sealed so I copped and went home.   When I cracked the seal it was obvious the rest were fake because...

1) They were much thicker. About 1.5x the size of a normal perc

2) The TEC stamp was too small.

3) The edges are not smooth

So I pop one just for shits and giggles. Damn it hit heavy. I feel if I took 2 or 3 I would have fallen out. This is so fucked up cuz they’re percs, like the most common entry level drugs lol

So everyone please be careful !!!  Lemme know if u got any questions. No pics btw cuz I gave em back.

Dealing with late-stage Lyme disease and the resulting chronic pain. My Dr had me on daily Tramadol but I was only using it PRN as my pain waves come and go depending on the die-off in my system. I don’t really like Tramadol, had to combine it with doses of ibuprofen to get better pain relief.  A couple of weeks ago I developed a blood clot at the end of my PICC line and now can’t take any more NSAIDs because I’m now on blood thinners so the ER Dr. prescribed Norco 5/325  TID for pain. The problem is that I sometimes go through episodes of panic attacks for which I would pop 1-2mg of Ativan. I’m pretty sure I can’t take those together, right? I know the norco half life is about 4 hours, would it be safe to take the Ativan then? Or are these prescribed doses so low that I’m not risking anything.  Trying to find some real answers but I keep getting links to rehab websites instead.

And only a few days after I threw away my dope, I bought it again.

I smoked some that day, but had 200mg left. Yesterday I met a girl who's my ""net-friend"". 

She wanted to buy drugs, and failed at doing so in the city centre. I said I could probably sell her something, and at first I had speed in mind as she already uses it.

She figured out that I had some heroin too, and she really wanted to buy it. At first I was hesitating, not wanting her to start doing it. She told me she was going to share half of it with a friend, and take small amounts/be careful.

I set the price at double the amount I paid. She then nearly doubled the amount I asked for, but I was still hesitating. Then she offered me 5x the price I paid, which I thought would get me a bit money for drugs.

I couldn't resist the offer, though I was also pretty high when I sold her. I'm not a dealer or anything, this was just a one time thing. She said she'd be careful, and remember that this was her first time.

Today she sent me a snap. She took all of it at once by injection. I thought ""Fuck! Fuck! FUCK!!"" because I was afraid she was going to OD. 

Luckily nothing bad really happened, thiugh her body started to shake and she threw up when the comedown hit her. I'm relieved as fuck. But to be honest it really irritates me that she promised to be careful, then she ends up injecting the entire thing when it's her first time!

Meme-poster, shadow commenter and long-time lurker of this sub. Kind of just venting because I feel conflicted.

I moved off of one coast to the other coast (USA) and quit using opiates about seven months ago. I was in a really bad spot after relapsing (I had thrown away three years of sobriety at that point) and I needed to escape. I have a good job at a non-profit and I'm more than likely going to receive a promotion next week- I fell into the normie culture that is your late 20's/early 30's. 

Anyway, when I moved, I totally abstained from opiates here. They're not easy to find where I am and to be honest, at this point I'm too fucking lazy to put in the work to try and find them. BUT- in June, I'm going back to my hometown for five days to visit and I've already been texting with my old dealer (we were... well, kind of friends. Poor Ry-tard- bless his soul) and setting up for him to hook me up with a whole script of percs.

Every logical fiber of my being is telling me- ""NO- don't do this- you know how awful you're going to feel afterward."" but every other passionate part of my brain is like: ""You've been sober for almost a year now- you've earned it- let yourself have fun. Just live in the moment.""

I'm writing this as if I'm going to even consider making a different decision when I know damn well I'm going to cop the first day I'm back home.

There is almost no information on this compound. I have searched through scholar and research databases with no success, and the only information I found about this compound after searching for information for 2+ hours online is:

1. It is 100+ times stronger than morphine
2. It is a codeinone derivative, which is essential for the creation of hydrocodone primarily and, to a lesser extent, oxycodone, as a substitute for thebaine.
Edit: Forgot to add it's LD50:
3. It has an IV LD50 of 31mg/kg in mice. This is much more higher than similar strength compounds like fentanyl. 

From what I know about chemistry and looking at the chem spiders:
*Codeinone is 1/3rd the potency of codeine. Codeinone is a ketone of codeine, which can be achieved by removing two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.
*The addition of a 14-cinnamoyl chain to hydroxycodeinone(which is another name for oxycodone) results in a minimum of 66-fold increase in potency.

This is speculation, but I think this semi-synthetic opioid could change the pressed pills game entirely. Having something that is so powerful in small quantities that is comparable in effects to oxycodone, it seems that it could make pressed roxis become almost identical in effect and feel to the real ones, and cost far less than a dollar per mg. on the street.

Does anyone have knowledge about this substance? It seems completely under the radar of not just research, but RC users and distributors as well.",1524345687.0

Shortly after, a couple of kind do gooders reached out to me and implored me to get a script. One said ""when you have a script, you know you can just go to a real pharmacy and pick it up. No more getting stressed out when someone doesn't answer the phone or doesn't show up on time. Also makes it easier to make travel plans."" Then they ended with ""P.S.- You won't have to deal with that bum Cliff anymore.""

&nbsp;

So I speak to the sub connect and they pushing to see me early at 11am so I say, I gotta sleep off a mean cold but I should be around. They then show up in my 'hood around 11am even though I never responded to their text before they departed.

&nbsp;

Hours later I make new arrangements to meet them half way, near my job. So they take some odd ball bus that doesn't let off near my job. They then text me while on the bus but they don't tell me where they'll be exactly. Then they call.. the call drops. I try to call back no luck.

I get one more text.

""My phone is dying...""

&nbsp;

After I finished my paperwork at work, I head toward home. On my way back home I get a call and the person is like ""no, please meet me on the other-other side of town. You know what, the cross street they proposed was near my planned final destination so I say fuck it I'll do it.

On the way there they go ""I can get a rid to that cross street, there's a mcdonalds I'll go to."" Then they say text when you're 10 minutes away. So I do. Before the 10 minutes the connect texts ""we're here"" and keeps texting ""how many minutes? how far?"" and ""please hurry"". Like dude, I told you exactly how long I would be when I left. There is nothing that changes that on a bike on hilly terrain.

&nbsp;

I get to the cross street. I see no McDonalds. They go ""meet me at McDonalds"" but that's 14 minutes away. So I decide, just meet me at my destination. No, they say we can drive to you mad quick. Well, turns out they could.

Car pulls up to the curb, she loudly gets out of the car but kindly gives me my product in exchange for cash and it's the mint flavored zubsolvs. The Yemeni deli owners across the street are looking at me like ""that car stopped next to a cyclist, they talked briefly, the car left and the bicyclist went his separate way.""

I started trying to get clean in January, went a week, relapsed, went another week, relapsed and so on. Then I was able to do subs for about three weeks and got down to .5 a day, but lately I find myself having a few days binge and then goin back on low dose subs again. Will this ultimately mess with my tolerance? I want to lose the dependency (about 4-5 years of oxy use with one three month period of clean time in 2016) but it seems like I’m just not ready to give everything up completely when I have big triggers. 
Every time I hit a really stressful patch I HAVE to use.
I have an addiction counselor and I’ve been pretty honest but now I don’t want to let her down. Also been sniffing small amounts of heroin, like less than a gram over a week, but I still prefer the pills.

Before last November, I was taking 10\-20 mgs \(just 1 or 2 pills\) of hydrocodone daily.  Had back surgery in November that went well.  Immediately following surgery for about 2 months I was taling between 6 and 10 Oxycodone a day.  By the end of January, 2018 i had slowed that pace to 1\-2 10mg pills a day.  Since  mid\-March I've been more or less maintaining on just 1 10mg oxy / day.  

By 2 pm every day I feel the screaches.  The reminders that I need the meds.  I've gone for single days a couple of times, but never more than 48 hours before I cave in and relieve the nastiness with a pill.  I'm nearing the end of my prescription, and know I wont have more without making up some kind of story, because my back surgery really was a success.  I want to get off the meds completely, but the question is, how long will I have the immense need to stop the screaches...that piercing ear ringing, the nasty fuzzy head/body need for the dose? 

It's been a very long time since I havent had the meds in the body.  Is there something that will help me get through completely weening the craving?  I've got about 3 weeks worth of oxy left in the bottle at this rate.  I dont want to find the bottom of the jar, without first stopping.

This is how I replied: ""Donating to your local needle exchange isn't a bad idea.

They help keep users from contracting HIV and Hepatitis C from dirty needles, give them information on local clinics that treat addiction, and if they can afford it, distribute Narcan that is the #1 way to reverse overdose and save the users' life.

As far as personally, support your friend. There's not a whole lot you can do for an addict other than urge them to stop using (without being crazy about it), and keeping Narcan on hand, in case they overdose in your presence. Learn how to use the Narcan effectively as well.

Thanks for your compassion. Users have a tough time as it is, but if enough people are like you, and care, I think we can take care of this problem.""

We used some more last night, and this morning we both woke up feeling pretty shitty. He had to throw up a few times and I nearly had to while feeling cold. We both have recurring headaches.

This led me to wonder, how quickly can one get withdrawal symptoms from this stuff? And what can one do to ease symptoms such as these? Also, any respectful information on how quickly one can get addicted is appreciated, since we both lost (and gained) some of the typical opiate fears around (ab)use and chipping.

We didn't like it very much at first, yet we both felt the need to use the next day, even though our rational minds told us it wasn't even that fun. I honestly prefer ketamine and benzos to this vague, even slightly nauseating feeling. 

Heroin isn't sold much around here, and we've both used an absolute shit ton of drugs in our lives, 30+ and 60+ respectively, but have never used anything to fill a void. Our lives are fulfilling and we're likely just going to slowly use it up over the next year or so and never seek it out again.

i realize to you guys tramadol isnt a big deal but i have seen so many doctors and i even saw a neurologist recently whom i was referred to by my insurance. we called ahead of time and made sure they treated tmj. when i got there , he didnt give me any meds, and told me he does not work with the jaw. he ordered me MRIs of my head, which ive already had done.


I asked him 6 times to order a MRI for my jaw


I was referred to pain management and a chiropractor i cant pay for . even though he said to me ""why go to a chiropractor if you know it doesnt help you""





Atleast this nurses/doctors (she seemed likea new doctor) stayed within her bounds and respected me to the upmost {without getting fired i guess} . The other ERs ive been to have not been kind at all! These guys atleast presented a few options . and atleast gave me a tramadol when i asked . 



i heard her speaking with the nurses about how to override the narcotic thing on the prescription monitoring thing lol. was presented with one tablet to go home . so yea. atleast some respect was given. atleast some relief was achieved.

I've been too afraid to try any options passed Physical Therapy and otc medicine like advil, which has caused me to switch to self medication, when i have the opportunity.  I was wondering if anyone with scheuermann's disease has been prescribed any sort of painkillers, or if anyone knows whether or not i have a chance at getting my own prescribed legally.  I currently don't have a primary care doctor, but have no problem getting one.  I have previously been prescribed Flexeril but after that didnt help i didnt pursue anything further at the time.  I have also had X-rays taken by my old PC doctor, not sure if that helps at all.  Thanks in advance for the help!  
TL;DR- I have Scheuermann's disease and would like to get painkillers if possible but kind of nervous to see a 
doctor about it.

I didn't have a job and he said he could steal some tools from his work. Later in the day we cruised the city with these ancient tools that had to be worth something. The first 2 pawn shops had no interest. We were getting sick and irritated. At last we found a place that was willing to buy them. Excited, immediately we go to the gas station to buy something to drink and a fresh pack of smokes. 

Not knowing who to cop from, we start driving around the hood. Someone will flag us down eventually. A group of OG's flag us down at the house past the stop sign. Behind us a couple houses down we see more people. We decide to turn around and check them out. They ask what we need and let them know we want boy, and we want to try it first.

Led into a house with nothing inside, he hands dude the money and he says I'll be right back. I knew something wasn't right, but J seemed oblivious. A couple minutes later, 2 more dudes storm in and say that J is a cop and he needs to empty his pockets. They said I'm cool because they've seen me before somewhere. He complies, and they throw everything on the floor, including the money we spent hours trying to get. Another guy runs in and grabs the money.  I say to J why are you letting them do that? He didn't know what to do. 

We walked out and the dudes had ""no idea"" where the other guy went. So now we're back in the car, dopesick with no money or dope. We light a cigarette and one of the guys asks for one and snatches the whole pack and walks away. I was so mad at J. He wouldn't stand up for himself and now we had nothing. ",1524273578.0

While I am taking it for pain due to Crohn's I really want to try and live my life without being beholden to medicine. Especially medicine that messes with my mood. 

I have been tapering for the past 6 months. I started at 16mg a day (2x8mg for pain), and was able to go all the way down to 0.5mg a day. But I was miserable. Every day I would go into withdrawals within 6 hours of my last dose. Making the conscious decision to no longer be miserable I started taking 2-4 mg a day. I'm rationalizing it as being needed in order to pass a job interview. 

Long story short, I tried extremely hard to go from 0.5 mg to 0.25 mg so I could jump. Instead of doing this I am wondering if anyone has gone through Rapid Detox while on Buprenorphine? Because of it's long half life I'm wondering if being under while the naloxone works is going to be enough to make it through the worst of the withdrawals. I've never had an issue with wanting to take pain meds again after detoxing, manually. I always start back up from a Crohn's flair. So I figure, I get this job, save up the money for rapid detox in a couple of months and just go get it done and deal with the long term post opiate effects. I'd have to deal with them anyways, I just want to be done with this stuff.

Anyone have experience with these rapid detox places?",1524273687.0

We dropped off the hustler girl that didn't do drugs, and made our way to the spot. ""Joe"" let's us in. We need 5 girls and 5 boys. We spend $100, made by committing various crimes. I didn't participate in much, but I still got a small share. I never liked the way everything was split up. At least I would still get some. 

Ol girl and her friend are prepping up their shots and talking about having hep c. In this abandoned house, we sat in the old dining room I would assume. Dirty yellow walls and brown flooring. A ripped blanket covers the door entry to the next room. Empty baggies and used needles piled up in the corner. A rectangle coffee table sits in front of the ripped up loveseat. My girl didn't have a working rig and didn't want to share immediately after them. They said there might be an extra one in the truck. How stupid. Asking for it. 

As she came back inside, I saw her holding it. The numbers were faded, and there was still dried blood inside and out. In this moment I was consumed by anger and fear. Begging her to not do this. It didn't matter. She needed her dope and there was nothing anybody could do about it. 

I couldn't take it anymore, so I walked outside to the back of the house and sat on what was left of the back porch. No idea what time it was, and I felt like I was alone forever.  Nobody came out to find me like deep inside I wish she would. I knew the reason I was so mad was because we both shared rigs. 

Eventually, I hopped down to the driveway and came back in the house. She was sitting on ol girl's lap. They laughed when they saw the look on my face. How did I get to this point in my life? It wasn't over anytime soon.

She had a bad habit of using dirty needles occasionally and it led to a bacterial infection. She had to have open heart surgery and even had a pacemaker put in. If she had stopped using then she would have been ok. But she continued and  because of that ended up in the hospital again because her heart was so weak. I guess her blood was too thin and she passed in her sleep. 

Ive never personally known loss because of this shit. I really didnt know or keep company with very many addicts...but its just kind of surreal. Definitely sad. She was really cool people. Always helped me out when i was in a tight spot.

Ps: hi ariel! I can't wait to hear from mom later about you messaging her what i post on here, you sad loser piece of shit. But i guess when you weigh almost 300 pounds and have no ambition all you can do with yourself is sit on your ass and be jealous of your little brother who does so much better than you could ever dream of in everything every facet of life. I would be bitter too, knowing that the person who gave birth to you thinks your a piece of shit and cut you out of her life, while mom and i's relationship is more healthy and stable than you could ever wish for. 

Man it feels so good to be happy and healthy and knowing my biggest hater (you, my non dear brother) is a sad depressed loser who has nothing going for him. I bet you have a smile on your face reading this, getting the reaction you've been harassing and provoking me for thru messages and fucked up texts. But rest assured, this is the first time I've thought about you. 

Does your girl friend know about the fucked up messages you send to your mother and brother? People get a huge kick out of it when i show them what you've sent the both of us and it just further proves what a lonely douche bag you are.

Also I’m an IV heroin user, I use at least .2 shots, but that’s only because I don’t have a lot of money, I never nod out from them or anything, just get kind of high. So a normal shot for me to nod out and be really high (obviously not overdose levels) would be at least a .3 probably more like .35 or even .4 My question is, is this patch even worth it to get? I know fentanyl is very strong but since it’s a patch it obviously doesn’t hit you all at once. A side not also is I am going to be flying across country and have many layovers and long flights, so I don’t plan to try to shoot it or smoke it (if that’s even possible) I plan to just use it as a patch.

We clicked in day one of detox and had awesome chemistry until the end. Her name is the same as my ex (love of my life) she's a musician like me as well, both have webbed toes, same sense of humor, and list keeps going. She started righting me notes... nearly professing her love for me. She was obsessed with me and I loved ever second of it. It was mutual.

She left and we planned to meet up afterwards. When I was leaving she happened to be in the front lobby because she had left some items on the rehab wing. I left two days earlier so she wasn't expecting me to be out yet.

She ended up driving me home and we fucked for hours and quite literally professed our love for each other. We both had multiple Os. I spent the last twenty four hours with her... she just left.

No the sketch part is that she is a stripper, has had two kids, she is 32 and I am 28, and she has an abusive husband who gave her a black eye and put five cig burns on her face and arms the day she got out. 

She's has crazy daddy issues, self worth issues, every one she deals with is still using. She has PTSD and other diagnosis. 

She is absolutely gorgeous, very funny and dorky. She is a kind of punk rock chick/Tom boy. She is so sweet to me. She also has lots of money and wants to be my sugar mama. She is going to pick me up on sunday and get us a room. I have only had sex this good with one other person.

Anyway, halfway through telling her how work is going, she interrupts me and says “[Missanthropiate], guess what?!”...”What, grandma?”...”I’M ON DRUGS!!” Now, my grandmom is this tiny little conservative old lady who has been living with some pretty severe back/leg pain. Her doctors have suggested opiates to her in the past but she always turned them down for fear of addiction. She said now that she is 94, her next step is the grave, so she’s not worried about “throwing her life away” with drugs. She seemed really happy on the phone and her delivery of the news was hilarious. I’m so glad she is able to find relief (without regrets). I told her I was surprised she got the prescription bc of how frugal doctors are with opiates these days. I’m going to make plans to visit her soon, hopefully we can share some of her homemade matzo ball soup and nod together.

Weekends are tough cause it's 48 straight hours of the whole family home. I've got nowhere to hide. They can see every step of my pain, every struggle to walk, the difficulty sleeping, the insurmountable fatigue. It's embarrassing.

Did pills and dope here and there for years never got full fledged addicted. Me and my wife had a baby. Within a year of our daughter being born she cheated on me, left me, and started banging any dude at any bar including my friends. Became heavily addicted to heroin and still am. Within the next week or so I am starting suboxone but I can't deal with the opiate depression on top of the depression of the woman I still love becoming the biggest known whore in our small town. The only thing that stops the depression is opiates. And I'm not ready to give that up, but I am ready to stop spending all my,money on heroine. About a thousand a month at this point. Most of my subs are covered through work insurance.

Way before all of this when I was like 18, I remember snorting a quarter of a sub and being crazy mood lifted and euphoric for like 8 or 12 hours. Is there any possible way or chance I will have even a sliver of that? I'm not expecting to feel as good as when I would rail and .5 of fent dope which is what I've been doing for a month or so, but I NEED some of that mood lift euphoria energy ECT. That painkillers used to give me way back when I will not be able to make it through work, seeing my ex, being with our baby ECT. Without it. I just fucking can't right now. 

I read one dude on here who was pretty respected saying he still can get blasted from his sub script daily by snorting about 2mg like twice a day. Is this possible? I can't make it through this period of my life without having that anti depressant euphoric opioid energy right now I just fucking can't I work full time and have a daughter I need to be happy for.

Pick out random case, take out dvd and lay it down so you only see silver. Keep your eyes closed. Then put dope where dvd went, close case, disorient yourself, and place in random spot. Then put the disc in a random spot. Key point, keep eyes closed.

2: Wall full of random books? Close your eyes, take out random thick book. Walk to another room without looking at book, open book without looking at cover.

I think it might be what’s in the fucking dope out there right now. I don’t know. All I know it’s that not even a week of fucking around, literally not even a full .5 altogether,  I woke up yesterday dope sick. Not shit your brains out, projectile vomit (although I did projectile vomit once, it was weird), knocking on deaths door level. But still. Dope sick enough to make me remember why I never want to be in that cycle again. Fuck that. Anxiety, tired but can’t sleep, hot/cold sweats, restless as fuck but still can’t manage to actually function enough to leave the house. 

Maybe I needed this to remind myself why I cannot “just do a shot once in awhile”. Not worth it. Anyway....what the FUCK though? Is my brain just trained to associate doing dope, then not doing dope with withdrawal symptoms? Making me more sensitive to it ? Or is it my first guess, which is this dealer is a piece of shit and if there is any actual HEROIN in that dope, it’s kinda like a  “can I have some heroin with my fentynal please?” ratio. I know when I was regularly using for a year, Fent was just becoming a thing but I noticed the withdrawals were way worse. Even with no tolerance, I did like maybe half a tenth in the first shot, felt that orgasmic rush, literally woke up 4 hours later, so fucked up it didn’t even feel good, barely able to stand up and walk to get myself a water, nauseous, and it was actually not very pleasant. 

Thing is though, unlike fentynal dope I have ever done in the past (including pharmaceutical grade pure fent administered via IV in hospital), this dope had legs. I always hated Fent dope because it had no legs. This shit is every bit like any Fent dope I have ever fucked with except that it stuck around. 

Well, I’m feeling quite hopeless and grim at the moment but I know it’s temporary. But yeah, I’m getting back on the shot. Already have my appointment. I don’t want to die and that shit will surely kill me.

But the biggest problem was the fact that he always hd them, so I didn’t take days off because “who cares?”.  8 months straight of doing hella oxys and I’ve spent so much ducking money.  I can barely even afford them anymore so my plug tells me he can get me this other shit and it’s way cheaper.  That’s when I started with heroin, again it was awesome since it was cheap as hell, but as tolerance built I was in the same situation.

Towards the end of this year I had to face my problem... well that’s a lie, my parents caught me and I had to admit my problem mainly because I was broke and I couldn’t handle withdrawals.  So early this January they put me on subs... but it wasn’t that easy.  I still wanted to get fucked up, so whenever I got money I’d buy heroin and stop taking my subs,  2 months of this and getting caught 2 more times.  We are now in March and it’s time to do it for real.  I’ve been taking a sub a day since then and now I feel great.  I don’t crave opiates anymore, I never thought I would feel this way again.  Not having to worry about getting money to not be sick, just enjoying myself without this shit controlling me.

I know this same story has probably been said about 100 times by 100 different people, but it’s just my story.  My advice to any of you kids around my age that are thinking the same way turn the fuck around. You idiots who post pics of oxys and think it won’t take over your life and everyone else is just a junkie idiot but YOU can’t get addicted because your different.  Well guess what?  You aren’t different and if you keep taking this shit you will ruin your life.  Luckily I didn’t go as far as shooting and I’ve managed to maintain my college grades but who knows where I’d be if I went a couple months longer.  Take the steps to quit now, it’s worth it",1524184613.0

They All were naive enough at 18, to still be  believing, that even with weed you can't control your self while high. i asked and found it's all the same shit still being taught. thus this post   SooooooooooooooO TEENAGERS LISTEN:  No, weed wont ruin your life. lsd doesn't make you jump out of tall buildings, and crack/ heroin are not addictions caused by one time use. You See, foolish as this sounds, we called their bluff on addiction. after being taught the same lies, we tried every drug. interestingly, we had not become addicts. obviously  they lied. They lied about everything except opiates. OPIATES Are not to be Fucked with. You will be dependent! it will control you. even as little as twice or once a week of controlled use can/will have you waking up dopesick, and unsure how weeks have passed since that 'control'. it doesn't take many days to get the ball rolling. IVE SMOKED CRACK/cocaine  scores of times/ Some times 3-4 dayS in a row. PERSONALLY I never had any withdrawal or cravings from coke.(this is just me though). BUT IVE BEEN A physically dependent heroin addict for over a decade! I don't have a problem with any of the other drugs. heroin will own you, it's undefeated. do not start using it.  they were not lying about opiates. now that you have the truth,  live life and find your joy.  find that joy any possible way, any way  that doesn't include opiates.  you're not special and you can't beat heroin  addiction's first enslavement. eventually, it will take control of your priorities and strong/weak, the end result is always the same. you will lose.  YOU will choose heroin over everything while with drawling. no human has won so far. it will leave you sweating, but bone cold. next you begin shitting while puking from the toilet. the  only break from this will be sneezing in rapid  fits.  that leads to routinely  wiping off the sweat accumulated . then you will be back to shitting ,while shivering.  sometimes, these symptoms   occur simultaneously.  sound fun?

I’m pretty aware of the main downsides to methadone. It would be annoying to be on a short leash like that, but I can’t afford to travel much anyway. Living at home with my mom, going to school right here soon, and I know there’s a couple clinics to choose from within ~20 mins of me. 

I avoided maintenance for years. I was so good at hiding the worst of my habits from my family. I didn’t want to commit to being opioid dependent forever but I realized I was already there so I got on subs. Please, please don’t say anything about how hard methadone is to get off of. I know. I can handle that side of things.

Last night I only took 2 kpins and no Xanax or trazodone. Normally that does nothing with such a small little bump of dope just a good relaxing feeling before bed.

Note: God = God, the universe, your respective God by name, or a stand-in for gosh, goodness or golly.. Nonetheless, the three words for OMG are what I naturally blurted out upon hearing that which I shall share exclusively right here right now.

&nbsp;


Earlier today I woke up, communicated with Cliff and upon getting paid, arrangements were made. A week ago I took $100 dope and cash on loan. Why? Well I decided I didn't mind biking to the ATM on his behalf with his card if I was gonna be given dope right after. I did get dope right after and all went according to plan aside from getting home at 6AM but that was because I was playing games on my new-old-new laptop and making plans to see the new Avengers movie. 


Yesterday went extremely well. I didn't feel like anyone acted particularly shady, I got my money's worth every which way. First I got exactly one bun from Cliff minus the middler's fee for our middle. Then later after work I was like ""you know, I want more but I didn't buhy more earlier because I didn't want to expose myself to shenanigans or tempt Cliff or faith."" Yeah, that quote pretty much sums up my thought process.

&nbsp;

Thus I contacted Derrick for a half, then realized he was actually walking to his guy to pick it up and front it so I upgraded to a full bun, I only asked for a half because I thought he was gonna pull from personal stock. He took only one bag and it was all fat and good dope. Shortly after that, which occurred after work.. I ate dinner then paid a visit to Cliffords house.

&nbsp;


Well first to get to the point of this post, something I assure shall amuse you, or anger you, or bubble up some sense of obligation that makes you urge me to contact adult protective services, I must rewind to how things got to the OMG moment.


&nbsp;

Before work I drop by Cliff's hoping the dboy/middle would show up before I had work. He didn't, he showed up 10 minutes after I left for work so I had to bike back on my break. I couldn't wait a minute longer than I did and still be on time so I cut temporal losses.


Upon arriving at Cliff's his TV wasn't in the living room. I thought he was just dope sick and too lazy to move his TV but it turned out that the electrical power was turned off in his and his mom's apartment. To watch TV and to maintain power to the internet modem/router he ran an extension cord from his sister's dwelling. Strangely, he didn't even power the fridge. Just the TV, blu-ray player and modem. The modem became useless too after the cable company turned that off. I guess both of those bills were due today.

&nbsp;

So if not for the fact that I owed Cliff $100 from last week, he would have no way to get dope and when given a choice between electricity and dope he chose dope. Well, can't fault him for that.. I'm sure many of us have done similar lol.


&nbsp;

Okay, well, now that we got the setup out of the way here goes the mess of a punchline!


As some may know, every two weeks Cliff then his mom gets their roxy script. Cliff has to share some with is mom because she shares some with him. It'd be easier for her if she simply said ""I'm keeping mine for me, and you keep yours for you"". Sort of like what I did to bring my costs down so that I could buy electronics and bike parts. I'm not dooing perfect, in that I shouldn't be buying dope for myself at all but if I'm gonna buy dope I want to make sure I take care of Numero Uno first and foremost. 


I mean like, if his mom didn't have to share with him, she'd have more and wouldn't need him to give her any when it was his script day. I would say the inverse applies to Cliff but he doesn't have the discipline to conserve a script without having to tap other sources. I mean yeah, I've seen him go through just 5 roxies 15's in one day but I don't really know if he was that conservative that day when he said he was. It's conceivable... but not the point of this tale.

&nbsp;

His mother has bad knees and she has been prescribed various opioids for over a decade. I remember when she used to get vikes. Sometimes I'll hear Cliff's mom moan and demand or request ""something to take"" from Cliff. If he is honestly at the bottom of the barrel he'll ask me, ""do you have any ibuprofen or Tylenol?"" They've bought bottles of acetaminophen...who cares how it's spelled but they disappear in no time once either one of them runs out of roxies. 


So like, what's worse is... there are times where Cliff will get blues between script days so he'll give some to his mom to take.. but of course she usually takes 15mg roxies so he'll break the blue in half. Then she'll complain she only got half. It's tough. The other day she actually wanted a second goblin and Cliff was like ""you gotta wait for it to take effect"", in fact that was right after he gave his last legit scripted pill to her.

&nbsp;


Finally, this evening Cliff was telling me what he did earlier that day. First the light stuff, at some point days ago he gave his mom 4mg of Suboxone and she slept really well. Sleep is something that comes hard for her, and when she don't get sleep she might be miserable enough to bug Cliff about all manner of bullshit shenanigans. From food to bills. Heck, if Cliff is too lazy to get up and she gets up and falls.. that's a whole operation so a sleepy Cliff's mom usually results in an undisturbed Cliff.


&nbsp;

Oh my gosh, I still didn't get to the point!


Alright here goes.... Cliff told his mom that a bag of Heroin was ""pure oxy"" and told her she could take it one of two ways. She took it and said the oxy was really good, felt good, licked the pain and all. 


ughhh... oh my God, jeeze, fuck.. like really? I'm just flabbergasted here. If flabbergasted could make a sound that sounded like a stuttering platypus, that's sort of me right now while pronouncing the word flabbergasted.

I had the day off so that I could go to therapy and I figured I’d end the latest binge and get back on the right track. Went to therapy sick as fuck and left my phone in my car. When I came back out I had a message from ol’ girl to come through and of course my addict brain said fuck everything lets get well. I picked up a friend and we drove to meet this chick. Long story short, we get to her around 4pm and we didn’t leave until about 7-7:30. Her plug had her driving all over the goddamn place while we waited at her house. I was going fucking nuts because at this point I was more fucking dopesick and losing my patience. This bitch  had us waiting at a gas station for an hour, then we had to drive 20 minutes to her apartment, and then we sat there for another two hours before ol middle girl finally came through. At that point I could’ve just taken the sub and been fucking fine, but noooooooooo I’m a fucking dipshit. And then she comes back with some RP 30s (they’re legit but meh). I had heard that these were being pressed around here so I fucking get out my narcan as my friend fucking chews a whole one and I stay sick for another 15 or so minutes until I realize that she isn’t gonna fall out (I was driving so I didn’t wanna do one of mine and risk ODing). I’m a paranoid motherfucker.

Tl;dr was gonna get back on subs but didn’t and waited three ours to get 30s even though I could’ve technically just taken it and said fuck the waiting game.

8ddqpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ddqpi/the_subway_station_christ/,5,https://redd.it/8ddqpi,Stadtmitte,The Subway Station Christ,"The first time that I walked through the (name redacted) subway station- back in my undergrad years before I had ever really seen heroin in the flesh, let alone having it become the focal point of my life- I was disgusted, unnerved, and mildly intrigued. The junkies panhandling there sat side by side, arms wrapped around bony knees, murmuring a small thanks anytime a passerby dropped a coin in their cups (always from a distance, as if to avoid catching whatever soul-disease they had). When the crowds were thin, they'd break out the foil and smoke their dope in the open. However, that was rare, and most of the time they would just sit in silent agony, sweating and stinking. When I passed by them on the way to school, I couldn't help but sneak a furtive glance, curious to see something that most people appeared to try not to look at. I vividly remember watching one pick up the stub of a cigarette to find it had some tobacco still packed in it.

How the hell could somebody do that to themselves? I wondered. I was no stranger to masochism, but the level of shamelessness and lack of fucks given by these homeless junkies exceeded anything I had ever seen. Most people ignored them, but there were plenty of dirty looks. Unfazed, the junkies held out their cups. They shot up and smoked up in front of kids, in front of elderly tourists. If the police came, they dragged their ragged asses up and away for about 15 minutes, then settled right back down. For all I know, they even slept there. Sleep, beg, dig through garbage, shoot up, repeat. What a life. Every day I passed by them, I sneaked a peek and imagined what they were thinking. When I became hooked myself, I understood completely. One day you're the master's student, the next you're living out of garbage cans.

Near the end of my study abroad semester, I was walking through the same station to go study for final exams. One of the regular junkies – the one with the filthy long black corpse-hair and roman nose - sat in his usual spot, eating something no doubt dug out of the trash bin next to him. Two companions nodded off next to him, evidently having recently shot up. Above him, the electronic subway sign read in loud words “No stops here today-- train driving through.” Some sort of maintenance on the line. This meant that, as opposed to the usual train rumbling to a slow stop to allow the passengers off, the train would barrel straight through the station onto the next one, fast as hell and loud as you can imagine. I always stood as far back as I could when the trains drove through, just an instinctual human reaction to stay the fuck back from theses steel beasts. You could really feel the power as they clanged and chugged and rumbled through- *don't fuck with me, i'll eat you up, step right up and see if you can stop me*! They flew by so fast you couldn't even make the individual cars up, making it look like one giant single machine. 
	

For the first time, when I was furtively staring at the junkies, he raised his eyes from the floor and met mine. I heard the rumbling from the depths of the tunnels behind me. The junkie's eyes were blue and wide and full of some sort of distant emotion- longing, maybe? Desire for something that doesn't exist, or maybe never did? He stared at me for a full 5 seconds, not blinking, not moving. The rumbling grew louder. Putting his mangy hands on the floor (I noticed he was missing a finger), he pushed, coming to a crouch and an unsteady stand. A rig dropped from his pocket. The rumbling came to a roar and my bones vibrated with the telltale sign of the train about to pass through the station. 

The junkie's expression changed in an instant- his eyes brightened, the ragged folds of his mouth curled to a soft smile, and his posture erect. He lost 10 years of age in a second. His sporadic teeth looked like tombstones in an ancient graveyard, but they accentuated his smile. I found myself unconsciously reaching for my wallet, feeling for some reason that I needed to give him cash, lots of it, maybe everything I had, because I KNEW he would use it to turn his life around, that he would clean up and settle down and come back to life, I could help him, that he would change the world with his greatness. What I felt in him was something so powerful, so compelling, that this one smile would lead to two lives changed- his getting clean, and me finding whatever fulfillment I was seeking and conquering whatever loneliness that filled my life. I felt my life in his smile. 

I opened my mouth to ask him his name when he stepped forward. He walked slowly, erect, Christlike. He brushed me aside, focusing on something behind me. He hadn't even seen me at all. He took another step forward. The train emerged, flying with reckless abandon from the far end of the tunnel. The junkie smile and stepped forward off the edge of the platform as the train barreled through, the smile never leaving his face.

When I first tried heroin, much later, his face came to mind. 4 years later and that junkie is me, and you can be damned sure that this ""opting-out,"" the quickest way out of addiction, just a train-station away, is always and forever at the back of my mind.

Maybe I'm over reacting idk but I'm not risking going back to sleep tonight that's for sure... Guess I'll just stay up until I leave for work at 6 30 ",1524125206.0

like, i have a great job. i just found out today that i’m getting a 23% raise ($10.5k) PLUS a $5k bonus in my next check this weekend. i could use that money on travel, actual experiences. i fucking love to travel, i love seeing new places and meeting new people. if i weren’t sniffing my entire paycheck up my nose every month, i could go to a lot of really neat places!

i’m an aunt to three amazing kids with a shitty mother - i could take them places! make sure that they know they’re loved and that they can come to me anytime that they need to and i won’t be too fucked up to be there for them.

i have a great boyfriend who i’ve been with for 6 years... we could save up for a house or get married. he’s on disability but with my salary and his benefits we could buy a house in no time.

idk what the point is of even writing this. as much as i hate myself for it, i know when that check clears this weekend, i’ll be racing my way to a stupor. i turn 29 in two weeks... i’ve been doing this shit for 11 fucking years. i’m lucky enough to be maintaining but who knows how long it will be before i overdose in my apartment alone, or lose my job from getting high in the bathrooms at my office.

i’m just tired of this compulsion. i hate that the only thing i think about is fucking dope. i’m not really living at all, just maintaining an existence where i get up and work for the sole purpose of sniffing heroin. everything else falls by the wayside, and i *know* how lucky i am and what a good life i *could* have.

and it’s my fault. i have the support system and ability to get treatment, but i’m not using it. i went to rehab two years ago and the most clean time i got out of it was 70 days. i’m not trying to throw a pity party idk i’m just in one of those moods. it’s late af and i can’t sleep so i figured i’d let you guys know where i’m at.

So I know that Narcan, when administered, blocks the opiate receptors in the brain from the opiates you've taken...But that doesn't mean it gets completely rid of the opiates in your system, right? 

Along with this I know after someone is given Narcan that they can go into immediate opiate withdrawal, which makes me more confused as to if Narcan just completely rids your body of all opiates...???

What I mean is, for example, if someone does heroin and is overdosing and given Narcan, it will block the opiate receptors in the brain but the heroin would still be detectable in their system for the normal amount of time heroin is detectable, right? 

I simply cannot imagine that an OD antidote would be able to just instantly get rid of any trace of opiate in your system.

And because this, apparently, is the kind of knowledge I have that I can pass along to the next generation, here I am. At least until they let me give this talk to kindergartners (again) or offer Junkie 101 at the community college.

We're gonna talk about three things: What to Do, How to Do It, and What Not to Do. My goal is to make this as easy as possible and instill a sense of confidence in the people who think copping drugs is too hard or too dangerous. If anyone has anything to add please chime in and I'll add it to post. I'd like this to be a community effort that, in the spirit of harm reduction, can help people stay safe in what is one of the less dangerous, but more nerve-wracking, parts of addiction.

#What to Do

There are a few ways to cop your drug of choice, but they all basically break down to one of two ways: open-air shopping or using a middleman.

Of the two, open-air markets are the logistically easier, but psychologically harder of the two. Most of the time just living in a city will make you familiar with the ""bad part of town."" When it isn't obvious which neighborhoods are shitty just Google for heroin busts, prostitution arrests, violent crime, and the like.

Once you know where you're doing you need to know what to do. For that I invite you to the next section.

The second method - using a middle - is less psychologically taxing than doing the dirt yourself, but presents it's own unique challenges. Of these, the one most posted is, of course, *""How do I find a middle?""* You're obviously looking for an entree into the world of degeneracy, so let me ask - if you're looking for a junkie, where would you find them?

Narcotics Anonymous meetings are a sure-fire way to meet junkies and methadone/Suboxone clinics are, by definition, full of people currently skull fucked on various poppy-related products. The downside here is, obviously, these are places where people go to get help with their addictions and while, yes, you're looking for help too it's kinda in the opposite direction of the help generally offered in these locales. If you can square it with your conscience then these are places full of helpful junkies... *Who you're going to drag back into the gutter, you horrible, horrible human being.* (Kidding... Well, mostly kidding.)

As mentioned by /u/billinsandiego, a good number of people attending AA/NA meetings are there because it's court ordered (Obviously, since each is independent, this depends on the meeting - location, time, etc.) Also, traditionally while you may be called out in the room and asked to leave, it's unlikely that law enforcement would be called for anything short of disrupting the meeting. Law enforcement, in general, leave the rooms alone because it's viewed as a helpful tool in helping people get clean. (In other words don't stand up and say, *""Hi, my name is Needa Hookuplz and I'm looking for a hook-up... Please.""* Try to be a bit smoother than that.) Finally, to increase your odds of finding a middle while expanding your network of fellow addicts it pays to look for meetings with a featured guest speaker as opposed to the normal, more casual meetings. *(Thanks /u/billinsandiego.)*

Aside from a junkie-buddy, your next option is going to be finding a more tertiary introduction. Homeless dudes literally live on the street and they know it better than you know the layout of your living room. Asking one for help finding street-based degeneracy is like asking a fish to find water. Prostitutes are in the same boat, albeit their's is more *Love Boat* and less refugee raft made of old oil drums and desperation. As a bonus, the homeless and the professionals are less likely to try and bleed you slow as a price for middling - but that's discussed below.

Prostitutes bring us to the newest (and most likely filled with bullshit and scams) way to find what you're looking for - the internet. Setting aside Dark Net Markets (which have been written about before by people much, much smarter than me - check out /r/darknetmarketsnoobs as a starting point; thanks to /u/spiritualasf for reminding me about that subreddit) you can use Craigslist, Backpage, and other internet classifies-style sites to find not only professional women but also, using the correct search terms, legit dealers.

*(I'm not 100% sure on what all the common drug-related search terms are, so if anyone would like to help me out with a list, I'd appreciate it. Also maybe a list of the most common drug-scams? This is out of my wheelhouse. Thanks.)*

#What Not to Do

Okay, so you've found a shitty 'hood. You've got money, transportation, and a need that can only to be filled with suspicious powders. So it's time to trade that money for those powders.

A lot of what I'm about to say is a mixture of common sense and street smarts. The next section, What Not to Do, will detail the Don'ts so you can avoid getting robbed, scammed, hurt, or arrested. This section is more the prototypical what I'd tell the nervous hood newbie before sending him out to sink or swim.

First, you need to know your local slang for the drug you want. Asking for *""One heroin please!""* is a good way to get your pockets ran. When I first moved to Chicago I had no idea what the fuck *""blows""* were - I always thought blow equaled coke - and correcting them by saying, *""No, I need a gram of heroin,""* had me turned away a few times before I caught on.

If you're in a car (which I highly recommend until you have more experience with the area) make the block once or twice to, hopefully, catch anything untoward - parked police cruisers, vacant-eyed creepy children, eldritch aliens, whatever. Once you're comfortable, pull up, locked doors, only the driver's window down, and place your order.

Some sets do hand-to-hands - money-to-drugs - some will have you give your cash to one guy and get your dope from another, hell, some might have fucking delivery pigeons. For the most part, however, it will happen in one stop, one transaction. Being asked to hand over the cash, pull away/make the block/part over there, isn't unheard of, but unless I knew that's how the set operated I never let my money walk more than a few feet away. Once that cash is in their hands it's theirs - ain't like you can co complain to a cop. Keep that in mind.

But, more importantly, is to remember that they're running a business. Unhappy customers don't come back, so burning you once for $100 is worth way less than someone coming back regularly. That's not to be said it never happens, so be cognizant of the situation around you. Avoid buying from single individuals - try to buy from a full-on set at a corner or on a stoop; don't fuck with randoms walking around. People alone could be hooked into a crew, or the could be freelancers - or they could be looking for an easy mark - while dudes sitting around in a group are obviously organized and doing more serious dirt then Scruffy Jimmy just ambling around.

Lastly - get a phone number from them. Calling ahead to make sure they're on can save you a ton of bullshit. Bullshit which could lead you to making poor decisions in the name of trying to make something happen. Pro-tip: avoid all possible flavors and varieties of bullshit.

Being on foot has many of the same considerations as copping in a car, just with the tension upped a bit. You'll still need to have your entry and exit planned - including alternate routes. You still need to carry the minimum cash necessary. I'd only take my ID, cash, and burner phone. Keep your cash somewhere secure, but easy to get to. You don't want to fumble around in a wallet while your dealer is looking at you like the world's saddest moron. Like I've said, Street Shit 101.

Exiting the area is the same on foot as it is in a car. Get in, cop, get out. Don't stop a block away to fix in your car or shoot up in an alley. You just open yourself up to getting harassed by the desperate or despicable - homeless and cops, respectively. Get home before you fix, but if you absolutely can't wait, well, sorry, but fixing in public is beyond the scope of this guide.

Lastly, let's talk about getting stopped. While I've seen and used a ton of ways to mitigate this eventuality (because it *will* happen, eventually) and dealing with the police is something every criminal needs to know how to do - and, ideally, do well - the fact is that being in a shitty neighborhood isn't a crime. The easiest way to avoid getting arrested after buying drugs is to not do anything illegal... Well, anything *else,* I suppose.

In other words, keep your papers (license, insurance, registration, and tag) up to date. Have no rigs, straws, cookers, or other paraphernalia in your car. Assume that if it's hidden, no matter how well, it can be found - because it can. And as much as it sucks, at the end of the day, swallowing your drugs is *way* better than catching a charge. *(And yes, CPD, I'm still pissed about needing to swallow that dope on fucking Christmas Eve, you holly, jolly, Christmas-ruining fucks.*) I keep an open 20 oz. bottle of coke exactly for this reason.

*An aside here - I've had the debate of hidden versus trashed way too many times. If you've got faith that your boy-pussy won't be probed, then, by all means store whatever you want in your sin cave. I'd rather just re-buy my dope than risk it, but hey, you do you... And do that boy-pussy goooood.*

Okay, so that's how you conduct yourself in an open-air market, but what are the niceties in dealing with a middle? We've talked about *where* and *how* to find them but what do you do once one if on the hook?

First off - felonies aren't free. It might cost you ten bucks or ten thousand. They might want you to buy them their own bag, or a rock, or a bottle. The point is that be ready to pay them for their help. It might be a tricky issue to breach, but talking upfront about what they're expecting will leave both parties in a better position. Overpay, underpay, haggle - do whatever you want, but be ready to pay *something.*

Buying their connect - outright paying for an introduction - is almost always going to be easier and cheaper in the long run. You'll pay less, over time, but more importantly you'll never be on Middle-man Time. (Just Dealer-Time, but that's something else.) They might balk, but offering more cash or threatening to walk away is an easy way to call the bluff. Damn near every dealer in the world wants more customers. Just taking the number (off their phone or yours if they use it) works but so does tire iron applied to a kneecap - like I've said, you do you.

That being said... 

Never let your money walk. If it's too good to be true it probably is. Never put more money in their hand than you're comfortable losing. Never let them discuss the deal with you able to hear at least their side of the conversation. Never let them handle the dope without you watching. If they're sick don't trust a single word they say. Spend every minute thinking about how they could fuck you - because I guarantee they're thinking of the perfect way to bend you over. As above - Hood Shit 101. I could give you a dissertation on street smarts, but, really, you either get it or you don't. Everyone gets taken a few times at first - they're just expensive lessons.

#What Not to Do

Above all I want to say this - if you're scared to cop because you think you'll ""be robbed"" or ""thrown in jail"" then you should really reevaluate whether or not drugs are a good hobby for you. *(Also it's kinda racist that you think just because you're a honky in the hood you're gonna get mugged or jammed up by 12.)* Ninety-nine times out of a hundred dealers are just dudes trying to make ends meet. In other words, they're people - just like me and thee.

That being said, there are ways to avoid being a victim of that last one percent. Be respectful, direct, and distantly polite. Make eye contact but don't stare. Carry yourself like you have a reason to be there. Don't dress overly flashy or carry expensive shit - purses, jewelry, phones. Don't *ever* talk shit because there is always someone willing to cash that check. Obviously, if you're white, don't say racist shit. *(The number of newbies I've seen that thought they could say ""Nigga"" in a roomfuls of bangers is stupidly high.)* Don't ask questions about their operation, their set, or how they function. Don't use overly precise terminology since it seems cop-ish and makes people nervous. Don't carry a weapon because it escalates the situation, any possible criminal charges, and you're way more likely to get hurt if you have one. *(You are not Rambo or John Wick. You're reading an internet guide about how to buy drugs on the street for Mother Morphine's sake. If anything screams, ""I don't need to a carry a gun"" more than that, I'll be fucked if I know what it is.)*

Just don't act like a tourist and, most likely, you'll be fine.

#Expanded, Additional Points

**- Copping As a Female**

While I'm not a woman, I've had a few junkie lovers and a few platonic female friends so I can draw from their experiences.

Being female changes the situation some, and in some pretty significant ways, but the base calculus mostly remains the same. Some dealers/middles might offer to trade drugs for sexual favors. It's depressingly common, and most prostitutes I've known started out pimped by their significant other or by preforming their first commercial sex acts with their dealers.

Some people might be more protective of females. As the risk of sounding like a racist *(build der wall, ya'll - /s)* Mexicans culture has a ton of extra machismo lying around and I've seen that translated as a degree of extra respect towards and protection for women. Take that statement with a grain of salt.

A female will get a harder look from a cop than a man, but the cop is less likely to push the issue and let you go. Searching/dealing with chicks is different and requires resources which might not be readily available.

The dangers largely remain the same, but with the added danger of sexual violence. The trade-off is that violence against a woman, or scamming a woman, is a bit rarer than against a man. That plus being able to more easily approach other women (minus prostitutes - they're easier to approach as a dude) and the added arsenal of feminine wiles - if one chooses to employ them - would make copping, in my opinion, easier for a chick than a man.

My biggest piece of advice to a female junkie would be this: be leery of accepting favors, freebies, or fronts from a dealer. Maybe he's just a cool dude doing you a solid, or maybe he's looking to get repaid in a way you might not be cool with. Just something to consider.

*(this section was added based on the question and recommendation of /u/ak47revolver9. i should have considered the difference between the sexes in the original post. thank you, ak.)*


**- A Final Note on Middles.**

The chief rule to remember when working with a middle is that, *They are not your friend.* Maybe they will be, one day, but until that chilly day in Hell they are, most likely, just working the calculus on fucking you over. Hell, even if they're a friend they're probably still doing that math.

Remember - you're subsiding for their habit. Would you want to give up working with someone who's paying you to cop dope when you were already going to cop dope? Nope - me either, so they really won't want let you go once you're on the hook. 

Be prepared that if they don't want to play ball and sell you the connect's information or you can't find a way to get the number yourself, then it's time to break out the big boy panties and act like you belong in the hood. Walk up with your middle once the transaction has been talked about on the phone. Refuse to let your money walk even a few feet away. Don't let them discuss the deal outside of earshot and never let the middle handle the drugs. Don't buy into the line, *""My guy don't like meeting new people,""* because I've never seen a dealer who's good with turning away customers. Explain to your middle that things can be done your way, and he can get a little something, or he can try to fuck you around until you tell him to kick rocks and then he gets nothing. There's always another middle.

Like I said - wear them big boy panties and act like you belong on these streets.

*(Thanks to /u/Mu_Kappa_Delta for pointing out that getting the middle out of the picture as fast as possible is almost always the best practice.)*


#Last Words

This isn't meant to be the end-all, be-all, dogmatic how-to guide to buy drugs. These are my personal recommendations based on personal experience, things I've seen, junkie camp-fire stories, and dope-fiend Apocrypha. For every person buying, selling, or middling dope there's a different way to do it. As long as you don't end up hurt, robbed, or arrested you've done it right.

I'm happy to answer any questions, expand on any of this, or incorporate any good points or suggestions into the body of the post. As comments and discussion come in I'l update this post, and thanks to everyone who's helped with comments, suggestions, and critiques.

Only living when you stop dying

Only grounded when your up, flying 

Smiling, beaming and shining 

Calling  the broken and beaten 

Who open their hearts when they're speaking 

Awaking the stirring and sleeping 

Untying the past they're entwined in.

Yet we tread, tired; the golden mile

I watched the streams
Frozen, to the ground, flow

They said you were hot
I couldn't see that
I just felt the warmth
And I wouldn't look back

I needed you closer
No more frozen days
I became addicted
To your warm rays

You weren't close enough 
I did all I could do
I left earth
To be closer to you

Yes, it was warm 
They said you would burn
But feeling your heat
Was my only concern

I left the ground
Now flooded with water
Everything was drowned 
I couldn't even bother 

Finally I was close
So close it burned
For you, within my reach
Said I could not learn

My branches caught fire
I screamed in pain
I hated the sun

Back in November I got arrested and charged with forgery (a class C felony in the US) and possession of stolen property (a misdemeanor in the US). I am a first time offender. I have been able to get the misdemeanor charge dropped, but am still facing charges for forgery. 
My lawyer tried to get me diversion through the prosecuting attorneys office but I was rejected from entering the program. 
At this point, there's a possibility I will get the chance to get the opportunity to do drug court. Drug court is a 12-24 month program where you have to submit to weekly monitored UAs, have a nightly curfew, have to live in halfway or sober housing, have a mandatory minimum amount of meetings to attend, have to appear in court weekly, and must be attending treatment (inpatient, intensive outpatient, and then outpatient). During your weekly court date if you have any violations you will face jail time. A lot of people end up spending 24 months in the drug court program and end up serving more time than if they would have just pled guilty. If you don't successfully complete drug court you get the maximum penalty allowed by law for your crime. For me that would be up to 10 years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines. If you do successfully complete drug court, you are not convicted of your crime.
My other option is to see what kind of deal I can get for pleading guilty. I'd have to take the felony  conviction for forgery but I would serve probably 90 days at the most... I could potentially get away with not doing any more jail time at all, and just spend time on probation.

Anyone have any input/feedback for me? ",1524088974.0

I usually practice excellent harm reduction techniques and am able to register on the first poke. 
Unfortunately, due to a combination of not being able to make it to the needle exchange last week and missing my shot because I was in a rush to do it in a public bathroom, I ended up with an abscess. 
In the past I've missed a few shots here and there and ended up with a pretty angry feeling lump for a few days that ends up going away on its own. Not this time! I got a lump where I missed my shot and it got more swollen, red, and painful as the days went by until it caught the attention of a medical professional. I  convinced the doctor that it wasn't *that* bad but he told me if it got any worse to get medical attention.
Of course, my abscess continued to get worse until I couldn't take it anymore and went to have it looked at. On Sunday I had to have it ""lanced"" and ""drained"". (By ""lanced"" I mean they used a scalpel to make about a half inch long incision. By ""drained"" I mean the doctor squeezed the abscess with every ounce of strength she had, and then proceeded to use tweezers, the scalpel, and god-knows-what-else to root around under my skin to find more places to squeeze.) Once the doctor was satisfied, the incision was then packed with some gross yellow antibacterial fabric. Finally, I was prescribed a week of antibiotics and advised to have my dressing changed daily at any urgent care or emergency room until further notice. 
""Until further notice""... Hmm... Interesting word choice, right? Let me explain what that apparently meant... ""Until further notice"" meant that even though I think I'm getting my dressing repacked and changed, I am actually probably going to be getting my arm scalpeled open and violently drained until further notice. Yep, I've had the same abscess cut to pieces, squeezed, poked, and prodded for the last 3 days straight. It doesn't get any less painful either. I can't wait until this thing can start healing!

So what's the moral of the story? Don't ever compromise your safety by not practicing excellent harm reduction techniques.

Now if people are going to continue to use something that they know could be dangerous, they owe it to themselves to be as safe as possible. ODs happen because there are no stardizations in potency, and this is especially true today on the streets. However, risk can be minimized through my friends solutions and dilutions. 

There are right ways to dilute things and wrong ways. The reason so many people die is because of the latter. 

While, as a user, you don't have control over the intelligence of others, you can minimize your risk of OD drastically and systymatically.

Even if the fent cut is applied properly, it is best to always assume it could very well be deadly. That is to say you should assume every powder contains various hotspots and varying potencies.

Now know it or not, it's possible you could already be very familure with dilution processe(s). When people dissolve compounds(solute) in solution(solvent like water) this a dilution. Essentially you are making a more concentrated product into to something more uniform and diluted. This is where the safety, metaphorical, key lies.

Note: this assumes the fent or analogues are in the hydrocloride salt form. It's also important to note that this will not cause you to lose any product or have any negative effects. It is in you best interest.

The thing that people do wrong, when performing their personal dilutions, is that they are diluting with far too little solvent. Safe practices include: 

And btw, preferably you need a couple oral syringes (1ml, 5ml, 10ml) and some marked, sealed containers (like water bottles), but this can be done without precision, because it is a dilution. That's to say you can dilute the water by eye; doubling the water volume each time.

-In order to minimize the variation in dosing, all of your product needs to be applied to a large volume of solvent (water).
-I cannot give you exact amounts because each will have varying strength, in addition to tolerance 
-you could end up with a few very weak solutions, however nothing is lost, water can be evaporated off, and it's better than death.

1. Cover your solute (powder) completely with water (inside container). It is important that you are doing this to the entirety of your purchase. Now shake / wait until complelty disolved. If you don't have precise measuring tools, go with a larger volume over a smaller one. This first container is your ×1 potency baseline.

2. If you have the precision, measure the volume of liquid. (Oral syringes are very precise; the smaller the better, measuring cups are not very precise; but better than nothing). Take 1/4 the liquid out from the first container and add it to the second container. Add the same volume of liquid that was in the first container, to the 2nd container.

3. Repeat step 2 as needed. But step 3 should be within safety margins (tread carefully). If so e correctly this should be 1/16 the potency of the the first bottle. Now test your solutions with an oral syringe. Going by .1 ml incriments, and tolerating up your dose until you find the right active dosage for you as an individual. You can then convert your remaining solutions to the desired potencily.

Such a statement to my pain clinic sounds like a horrible idea. So, if I contacted my pain clinic, what should I tell them? I've been going to the same pain clinic for a couple of years, and I've never made a strange request from them before. I have a good relationship with my pain doctor.

What other suggestions do you have for someone to legally avoid WDs who is going to come up short by about 10 ten days before they get their meds legally filled again?

A few things to note:
- I have an ample supply of klonazapam, ativan and xanax available to me, although I have a high tolerance to all three.

- I have a large supply of lyrica.

Make no mistake though, I am going into WDs in a few days.  The above drugs may help around the edges, but I need to find a legally-viable way to completely avoid the WDs so I dont lose my damn job!  Any and all recommendations will be greatly appreciated.  :)",1524047235.0

I still lurk and come comment/post here once in a while but not as much as last year when I was in Cambodia. But anyways, I just wanted to check in and let you guys know yesterday, I did my last bundle and a half between 5pm and 6pm and ever since, I've seen my wife get on the medical transport car to see her go to detox center, I'm here at home with my roommate downstairs, trying to kick it myself. I need some support. You know that feeling where you're like, ""okay, I did my last shot and I'm not going to cop dope again, for a long long long time if not forever. But what now??"" Is it just a waiting game?

I've got:

- 8 x 8mg/2mg Bupe/Naloxone generic (basically subs)
- Mountain of clonidine
- 26 x 10mg Valium (diazepam)
- 3 x 1mg Klonopin (clonazepam)
- multivitamins, vitamin B complex
- imodium (loperamide)
- source to cop more benzos and subs and stims

Help me schedule when to start my subs out (if i run out, i have source to get street subs so it's ok with the limited supply) and gather resources and check if i'm missing anything i can easily get before i get uber sick, because that bun and a half i did is holding me off right now, I'm surprisingly not physically sick yet, at least not to the noticeable amount where I start complaining.

I wish I can go to a medically supervised detox setting inpatient program. I can't cause my permanent residence status is not yet granted so I don't have any insurance nor am eligible for any. I just simply cannot afford it financially anymore to support me and my wife's habit and since my wife left to detox, I'm going to be kicking this alone at home.

Wish me luck and keep me distracted please and don't let me cop. I had been spending $210 minimum every day for the past few months. I setup my nomo clock app on my phone just before writing this post. PM me if you want to. Some of you already know me off reddit. Say hi if you remember me and/or my cambodia dope posts from last year. I used to be a pretty active member, I just haven't had the spoons to keep doing that and also had been couple domed for the past few months, not to mention other crazy stuff that goes on in my life (like number of really crazy things I shouldn't mention for legal reasons).

Oh, and my 2 class C felony for CPCS (criminal possession of controlled substance) dropped down to Class A misdemeanors and has been put on ACD (adjournment in contemplation of dismissal) so what that means is it's all going to get dismissed in September if I don't get arrested until then. It was for my legal prescription from south korea, but the state troopers couldn't identify that it was mine cause they couldn't read korean and tell that it was a legal prescription, so they charged me with felonies and i had to spend time in jail after that through thanksgiving cause I needed the judge to be present to get bailed out and the bail was posted the day court was closed for thanksgiving. That's just an update since I remember posting about it a few months ago but back then it was still felony charges. How stupid.

So, that's that. I miss my wife a lot. It's been 10 hours since I saw my wife and I'm so devastated. But this is supposed to be an uphill battle, right?",1524043756.0

This is like when i was high and i would force myself to stay up to wait until i was less high to fall asleep. It feels exactly like that. 

I also have mad health anxiety, every little issue i have i find out what the worst csse scenario is. The last few months i have been thinking alot about mortality. I really am coming to grips with what i experienced and who i became while on drugs, i have had clean time before but it never felt like this. It would take a very drastic thing to make me go back to use. I mean, i think about it, i play with the thought, sometimes i get a taste of that desire that used to drive me to use drugs, but it seems gone. Even my serious pain issues, i seem to be able to deal wih better without drugs. 

The upside to the increased anxiousness is i know how to cope with it, and alot of times i just accept this is mostly how life will probably be for awhile.  I cannot stop thinking of death and dying, though. I cant and havent looked at my face in the mirror in a long time. The main thing i think of when im observig people is that one day they and i wont be around like we are anymore. I am obsessed with diseases and cancer, i dont know whats worse, blinding yourself willingly to degeneration, or accepting it and enveloping yourself with it. If someone offered me a bag of dope i would probably take it, but if you offered me 20 dollars or a equivalent dope tokens, id take the money and buy groceries with it, honestly.

This compound was sold under the name of 2-Me-MAF; a close relative of another potent fentanyl analogue which had recently been banned in China, known as methoxyacetylfentanil or MAF. At first the users reported it to be similar to MAF in potency and euphoria, just another of many delicious analogues available to opioid RC enthusiasts. Ten thousand strong doses for less than a hundred dollars.  

A couple more months passed and suddenly there were reports of the new batches of 2-Me-MAF being unlike those previous. Some wouldn't dissolve in water. Some had no effect at all. Many users reported their product did have an effect: a horrific and stimulating psychedelic trip, probably courtesy of kappa receptor agonism. Our beloved mu-opioid receptor mediates euphoria and gives us reason to throw our lives away for heroin, while its sister the kappa-opioid receptor mediates dysphoria. One user had their order of 2-Me-MAF sent off a toxicology lab to be quantified; the result confirmed the sole presence of 2-methyl-methoxyacetylfentanil.  Perhaps the euphoric batches of 2-Me-MAF had in fact been old MAF stock, too valuable to just be thrown away when the government prohibited its manufacture. Who knows.  

Onwards to my question: it's old news that fentanyl analogues can be purchased through Chinese wholesalers. Low-level dealers are aware of this, and I assume 2-Me-MAF has already made its way to the street as an aduterant in heroin, terrorizing everyone it meets.  

Yet I haven't seen any reports on unpleasant psychedelic heroin, so I'm asking here: does anyone know what I'm talking about? Have you taken heroin tainted with this chemical, or heard from somebody who has?",1524037654.0

When I was using heroin I really only used with one person. Me and him were best friends. We hung out, we played games, we smoked weed, and we really just did the kind of dumb shit you'd expect two young dudes to do.
I discovered pain pills, and soon after I was shooting smack. He was curious, so I allowed him to try it. At this point we're doing what we've always done, just taking a lot of breaks to inject a lot of drugs. We even went to college together. Two weeks into college though, I overdosed and almost died, when he found me and did CPR and helped my breathing while he called the paramedics. 
Now we are both (mostly) sober. We still smoke weed and drink occasionally, and we both hang out and drink Kratom sometimes, but my family is NOT comfortable with me being near him. They fear that I will relapse and die. 
I feel like I owe him the respect to not just abandon him. He is my best friend, after all. Is my family right? Would it be healthy to just drop him and stop speaking to him at all?

I can't stop listening to his music lately. I'm in that sober phase where music is so powerful and emotional. I'm a musician anyway and when I'm high I let the music die. It's sad.

I meet my girl at the subway transfer from the n to the 7  to pick up money. I had Venmod her money so she could take it out of the bank for Me, long ago my accounts had been charged off after I Over drew them into oblivion.  She wanted to know what it was for...she doesn’t know I use heroin and I came up with a corny excuse I think she bought it but I didn’t care at that moment if she did or didn’t. She didn’t kiss me goodbye when we went our separate ways...I knew she was mad and I don’t blame her. But I can’t even begin to deal with that now...I have one thing on my mind...getting on that 7 train. 

I was lucky enough to catch an express...2 stops instead of 8. I still had a 20 minute walk after I got off and that’s walking at a normal pace which I was not...It was an 8 minute ride from start to finish it felt like a decade but finally my train dropped me off at my desired location. I was so close but still so far away.  A one mile walk sick  I would never make it. My legs were cramping my nose was dripping and I was sweating but freezing all at once.

I begrudgingly walked down the steps of the platform to the street below. Taxis lined the street waiting for a customer. I counted my money and decided fuck it I’m taking a taxi. 35 minutes turned into 4 and all of a sudden sweet relief was walking its way towards me with a grin on its face. My cabby was waiting around the corner for me.  I knew I could walk it back, once I was well it wouldn’t be the slightest issue but it was still cold out and I just wanted to get back to my 7 train. 

Just like that I was walking back to the cab rolling the bundle between my fingers. I find it funny that until i get these little baggies up my nose I will not relinquish my grip on the bundle, it’s not to leave my hand until I start to open them. I hop back in the car and tell my cabby to take me back to the train. I lay my phone out and immediately start opening and pouring 4 bags out. I move them into 3-4 lines, grab the straw from my pocket never being more careful than I was at that moment not to spill my
Precious cargo laid out on the screen of my phone. Day in and day out bags poured out onto my phone waiting for me to put them up my nose.  

In an instant I feel 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 110, 200% better. as each second passes my body returns to normal. It’s actually kind of sad.  My cabby asks me if I just bought weed as I clean up my supplies in his back seat. I laugh and simply say “No, I wish man I wish.” If only it were as simple as weed. 

We make it back to the subway and I pay my partner in crime who  I volunteered without his knowledge. I thank him for the ride and exit the car.  Gone are the sweats and the muscle cramps and I’m not even cold any more as I have that amazing fire burning on the inside keeping me warm. Just as my other symptoms immediately subsided my appetite quickly returned and i decided to spend my last $2 on 2 shitty McDonald’s cheeseburgers... but alas the 7 train awaited me.  The climb up the stairs this time was effortless I could have taken them 2 at a time if I desired but I decided to walk like a normal person. There would Be no express train on the return trip. As it only runs express towards the city during the morning commute. This time it would be 10 stops back but for all I cared it could have been 100 stops. As the train pulls away I don’t focus on each and every stop like I did on the way here. Now I allow my self to become consumed in my phone and before you know it I’m back where I had met my girl an hour prior... as I boarded the N and headed towards my Final destination 5 stops to go, feeling so much better than I did on my way. i couldn’t help but look across the tracks imagining sick me coming back this way only an hour prior. The difference was astounding. And it Instantly disgusted me. My daily trips on the 7 train. Heading out sick and heading home happy.  I can’t get over that, and  it eats at me, atleast it does for now. Until tomorrow when I head out sick going from the N to the 7 to a taxi and back all over again.  I feel like this is my own personal  groundhogs day. And there seems to be no escape. Until tomorrow 7 train. Until tomorrow

Below you will see the fentanyl warning reports we have received in order from the most recent, to the oldest. All fentanyl warnings are flaired as such and archived, so you can search for them by [clicking here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/search?q=flair%3Afent+warning&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) Make sure to sort by 'new' to see the newest fentanyl warnings.

Here are some things to remember about heroin/fentanyl dope mix:

* You can purchase fentanyl test strips at [this site for $10.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/) They detect the presence of even the smallest amount of fentanyl and they will detect a good number of the fentanyl analogues as well. Is your life worth $10? You can't get high again if you are dead!

* There is no way you can be sure the powder you have been given does not contain fentanyl without testing, and there is no simple, fool proof method for checking it yourself besides the [linked test strips.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)

* Just because it looks, smells, tastes, and is chunky like good clean heroin doesn't mean there is not fentanyl in it and that it's not deadly.

* Be aware of pills that you are buying as well, it is getting more and more common to see numerous imprints of pills that are being counterfeited with an unknown amount of fentanyl in them. There are some very good fakes going around out there that will fool even the most seasoned pill user.

* Just because there is not a warning in your area it does not mean there is not fentanyl tainted dope around. Be safe, start small, use with a friend, have Narcan on hand, and **do test shots!**

* Be safe, be smart, start small, use with a friend, have Narcan on hand, and **do test shots!**

For the past 3 almost 4 years now, I've been able to keep my habit well under control. I only do pills (oxy and tramadol) as heroin is a much more slippery slope. I'm only 20 and as of recently I am now basically the boss at my great paying job meaning I am in charge of guys almost double my age because no one works even close to as hard as I do. I had my first few experiences with PK's when I was a sophomore in highschool. One of the kids in our stoner friend group had some sort of muscular atrophy condition I believe it was so he was always had a ridiculous amount of pills he would hand out to us like candy. The first few times I tried hydro and oxy it was fun but nothing I would go out of my way to get. It wasn't until a few years later that I tried again that my love for opis really started. I used to be a huge stoner because it would work wonders for my anxiety and depression up until I had a full blown nightmare acid trip. Ever since, weed has been ruined and that was about 4 years ago now. I do use them everyday after work. It might sound dumb but I have a personal rule where I won't get high until 5:00 or later if I'm still at work. I never work while high. I redose once at 8:00 or 9:00 and will very rarely redose for a second time. I never go more than a few weeks at a time without taking a tolerance break so that I don't become too physically dependent. I don't enjoy any other drug at all really and I have no intention of stopping anytime soon. I don't see anything wrong with my drug use as it's not hurting anyone else, it doesn't get in the way of my responsibilities. Addiction and health issues aside, I see my drug use no different than someone who get's stoned or has a few drinks every night. The concept is the same. ",1524009452.0

So I am a trained phlebotomist which if you don’t know is somebody that taps veins and draws blood all day long. Below is a list of tips you should ALWAYS follow when shooting to preserve your veins, heart, and avoiding infection. 


CLEANLINESS/ STAYING STERILE:

Before beginning your session, always make sure that your hands are WASHED CLEAN and that the area that you will be having your substances and rigs is clean as well. 
Please I cannot stress this enough, use a brand new needle every time. Do not ever share needles with anybody else as well.  You can purchase them on Amazon as I’ve been told and other places ESPECIALLY veterinarian websites online in bulk for cheap. Some states actually allow you to purchase them for insulin without a prescription. There’s no reason you should be using dull needles.
Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab, rub the swab in a circular motion for 15 seconds. It should be 70% alcohol or higher.

MICRON FILTERS MICRON FILTERS MICRON FILTERS They are very cheap online and they are lifesavers. No excuse to not have them! They will SAVE your limbs and we all like those don’t we? 
THESE ARE ESSENTIAL!!!


 NEEDLES:

Use a new needle every single time if you can as the sharper the needle, the less tissue damage but if you absolutely cannot, then use it only up to 4 to 5 times tops if your budget is tight. This is because the duller the needle gets, the more damage and scarring it will cause to your veins that is irreparable and nobody WANTS track marks. This is KEY to keeping your skin and veins in as good as a condition as you can while shooting. You wouldn’t even know I shot by the looks of my arms. 

If you do reuse a needle rinse it and sterilize it if possible you can boil them in hot water on the stove. If you cannot boil it, make sure you thoroughly rinse it and store it with the cap on in a sterile place. Bleach is just as effective if not more!! May even be as easier option to you depending on your circumstance. 

Use the smallest gauge needle that you possibly can. This will obviously cause the least amount of damage and frankly pain.

And obviously before administration, make sure all air bubbles are removed my tapping the side of the syringe and pushing the remaining air out with the plunger.

FINDING A VEIN:

Stay away from veins in your feet, 

Constantly rotate the sites that you use. It is not smart to keep going up or down a vein a half an inch and shooting multiple times in that area. You should let it rest and use a different spot.

Try to use your ante cubital which is the center vein in the ditch of your arm. If not, use any vein that is large and easily accessible. 

Veins feel like a garden hose. They should be a little bouncy to the touch. You should palpate for a vein with just one finger. Once you have found a good one it’s time to get blood flowing into that arm so you can tourniquet it. 

When tourniquetting, the rule of thumb is *4-6 inches* above the injection site. Make it so that you can remove the tourniquet while injecting. I do this by having the end of it in my mouth or having a belt wrapped around under my thigh and up and over my arm and doing it that way. This is important so that you can relieve pressure before you take the needle out. 

Make sure the bevel of the needle which is the pointed opening is FACING UPWARDS!!
This is proper practice and less damaging to veins. 
In other words when you are putting the needle into your skin, you should be able to see the opening of the needle. It should be facing the sky so that the most pointed part of the needle is inserted first.

If you think you are in a vein and did not register, DO NOT DIG AROUND!!
 Pull the needle completely out, get the air out, and attempt again. I CANNOT stress this enough!! This causes major scarring and damage to your veins and it is called raking. NO GOOD. 
Think of it as taking a knife and cutting up your veins. Don’t do it because you think it will be quicker. Eventually you won’t be able to use that site because of practices like this.

If you are using veins on your forearm that tend to roll you can use your tourniquet above the site as well as one below to keep the vein from rolling or if you have a friend, they may apply pressure to the other side as well with two fingers. 

Drinking water will help keep your veins open and more easily accessible so make sure to drink water and keep hydrated always. This is honestly a huge huge tip especially for people with smaller veins and people that don’t drink enough water. Even after one day you will see a difference. 



SHOOTING:

Once you have registered, pull back slowly (this is important) and inject an amount, register again and pull the plunger back to make sure you are STILL in the vein and finish the injection. This is also a ridiculously important part. You will be able to feel if you are not in the vein. It will have a slight resistance to the injection and tends to burn or hurt. You are highly unlikely to get an abscess if you register a couple times ensuring that you are in the vein as well as following the cleanliness steps. 

As you are pushing the plunger in for the last injection, you should be removing the tourniquet at this point. You MUST leave the needle in before you take the tourniquet off so that pressure is not shooting towards the injection site. This WILL cause bruising and hematomas. 

AFTER THE SHOT:

Once you have removed the tourniquet, slowly remove the needle and have a paper towel or tissue ready to place MODERATE pressure on the site for a least a minute. This will prevent brusing. 

** A COMMON MISCONCEPTION **
DO NOT BEND YOUR ARM IF YOU INJECTED IN THE DITCH RIGHT AFTER. HOLD YOUR ARM STRAIGHT UP WITH APPLIED PRESSURE.
Bending your arm actually opens up the small puncture you made in the vein more as the vein moves. 

Put on a bandaid with a fresh piece of rolled up paper towel under it so it applies pressure for an hour or so and enjoy your high! 

If you experience any bruising after despite these tips and steps you can use an Arnica cream that will overtime reduce the bruises quicker than normal although you shouldn’t have so much as a red dot if you followed these steps! 

SORRY FOR THE LENGTH! But this stuff is all so important guys. You literally cannot even tell I shoot up because of these practices. Enjoy guys! And PLEASE me know if you have any questions. I am more than happy to help you guys out with being safe. Message me anytime.

There will now just be one post stickied to the top of the sub titled 'Fentanyl warnings and information' or something similar to that. Inside this post there will be some information that is common sense to some, and valuable to others; like where to purchase fent test strips, signs of fentanyl dope, and other stuff like that. There will also be all of the fentanyl warnings that have been submitted to us listed from most recent and getting older.

**You guys will still submit the fentanyl warnings the same way that you have been** and we will continue to lock them, but they will be compiled, linked to, and organized inside this one post at the top of the sub. There will also be some additional features added like searchable flair and some other little things.

Within a week the bags were getting slacker, the dope shittier and I'd have to wait upwards of three hours just to score a shit, slack point of bap.

To top it off, this motherfucker wouldn't answer the phone half the time.  I ended up having to buy overpriced blues in the interim and texted him telling him that he had lost a $300 play.

He texted me back with ""money doesn't make me move"".

I broke off all contact with him after that and continued to buy overpriced blues until I got a solid connection that is ALWAYS fat and I come to them, not the other way around.  No waiting or any bullshit.

Used to wake up and when I took my first pills, felt amazing, how most of you feel. Last year found out about kratom. Started a bad habit of taking more oxy some days and supplementing with kratom on low days.

Somehow, early this year, after 4 years of taking opiates, the euphoria went away. Like tolerant 24/7 even though I have that microwithdrawal in the morning before dosing

Often when I get my new batch of oxy I set aside hard work ""treat"" days where I take like up to 50-80mg and borrow from other days (where I just do kratom and 10mg). 2014-2017 those days I'd be drooling in love with myself. Now, when I tried that past couple months, just felt no different than 30mg, but tired, very itchy, bad eyesight. Extra side effects, no bliss. I get a legal perscription 30mg for nerve pain,in my late 20's now so maybe age plays a role.

I got into potentiators from here when I was running low and got desperate to make every bit count. Grapefruit juice, tonic water and DXM at the end of high dosing days, because it's supposed to reset tolerance. 

Maybe it was that, maybe it was sometimes taking kratom on the same day as normal oxy dose, in the afternoon, when in the past only took oxy between 9am-2pm, and toughing through the afternoon crash

Maybe if I figure out what I did wrong, I'll learn something valuable about tolerance and getting the most of your opiates, something I can teach others to avoid so they don't have this happen.",1523996398.0

I just shot up a little while ago, after picking up my 2 month keytag.

I'm finding the same issues I had previously with NA still following me around. Basically, I don't like the culty-ness of it. I do like the comradery, the peer-to-peer support, I think that works amazingly well.


I can't even bring this up to my NA group or sponser because I get the canned response of ""well you're obviously not ready"" or ""you're not trying"" etc. I don't like how they will litterally harp and yell at a newbie if they use the wrong nonmenclature, etc.

edit: of course I'm not ready to get 100% clean, no addict is. See that's the problem, it's an all or nothing kind of thing. There's no middle ground I can shoot for and work my way up.



I don't like the ""obsessing about being clean"" aspect of it. I don't want drugs (or not using drugs) to be the main focus of my life.


I want to be able to use on the occasions I want to, and have the will power to say no when I know I'm encroaching physical addiction.

Basically, getting clean got me to a point where I could finally go to Central America and visit family.  I went, and was offered all the cocaine of  Central America for essentially peanuts.


So I bought the cocaine from some 12 year olds, and tooted my week away. I guess when I came back I wanted to do more of it, but cocaine is so expensive in the states and crap compared to the crap I was buying off the children.


Getting sober is a nice (lofty) goal, and I'd like to attain total sobreity, but not at the cost of my sanity.  IMO, living a life these NA hardcore people live, where it's constantly ""meetings this, sponser that, meeting, meeting...etc"", that's not what I want.


I guess what I'm saying is IDK what to do. should I continue on the NA path? or just give it up entirely? Or somewhere in between?

Non hateful opinions are welcome!

As are hateful ones, just remember you're being mean to someone who loves you.


and I *really* love you.


I don't feel like I failed, I feel like I hiccuped, and need some direction. Is there any way to balance this? Being a junky is no good, but being a NA-addict, is equally as bad imo.",1523980713.0

Also, what are your methods for getting your powder the finest?","Haven’t seen a post like this in a while. Everything is drug porn, candy porn, newb questions, etc. All are fine of course but wanted to change it up a bit. 

My ritual is that I have a box I keep everything in that has a nice smooth side. It’s from a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones and has perfect little compartments inside. I keep everything inside and take out what I need. 

My ROA, contrary to my user name, is to sniff everything. It’s something I started a long time ago and I think I’m more addicted to sniffing sometimes than the drug itself (not!). 

My DOC, which are oxy 30’s (A215 baby) come out, usually 2-3 depending on if first dose or not. I also take out my card, my straw, lighter and my clean (as it can be) dollar bill. 

Turn box over on my lap, so smooth side is on top and put dollar bill on top of pills. Put lighter sideways at first to make the initial crush. Once somewhat crushed I then turn lighter vertical and run everything over with the bottom of the lighter. I feel I get a better connection with the top of the box in order to crush everything finer. 

Once I get it as fine as I can I then scrape the dollar bill off as much as possible.  I know I shouldn’t because money is gross but to make sure nothing goes to waste I wipe the dollar and lick my fingers, then use wet fingers to clean rest of powder off dollar. 

Then use the card to chop away. 

This is where my second question comes in. I feel I can only get the powder so fine, and knowing that the finer the powder, whether it’s pill powder or H powder, I am curious what other methods people use to get the finest of powder. 

Next I line everything up and use the straw to take me to euphoria. I sniff as light as possible so that the powder coats my inner nostrils and does not go to my throat. A drip is inevitable but try to lessen as much as possible. (Btw, I love the way an oxy drip tastes)

I usually do this in my car which is parked in my apartments underground garage, so I feel safest there. I made a post the other day about how I go about doing it at work; which is a whole other ritual in itself. 

So, opi fam, if you’re bored and want to contribute, what is your ritual?? Because let’s face it, it’s all we have to keep us sane...",1523965761.0

Chris believes a percentage of life juice saved from the dying is given to their savior. He first uncovered that truth when he was a senior in high school, he pulled his friend off the road before a truck sped by. His meth addiction is only secondary to his addiction to saving lives. Chris has absorbed enough life juice that he's beyond human, and by all intents and purposes, a god. Or so he says.

I have been a consistent user of oral synthetic opiate painkillers for several years and have developed a pretty massive tolerance. Obviously my standard dose has increased steadily  all while using the same medication and suddenly in the last three weeks or so something really weird has happened.  (and just to clarify yes I have confirmed the meds I have are the same, legit script I've been using, I'm not suddenly taking some fake pills with fent in them or something). 

But suddenly the dose I have been consistently taking, one which I very gradually built up to and have very established, consistent reaction to, was too heavy for me to the point of pretty significantly needing to reduce my dose and now literally only over the course of less than a couple weeks I've had to reduce my dose to what it was almost like a year and a half / two years ago, and it's still feels like it's maybe a bit much. 

Basically it's like I've experienced a sudden and inexplicable tolerance drop without having reduced my dose or frequency of dosing. Has anyone experienced this? Is it possible that there's some kind of latent medication built up in my system over the years that is multiplying my normal dose to be more potent?

I know to some people this must sound like the dream, a sudden tolerance loss without having to take a break but it's also kind of bizarre and frightening as I want to be careful and safe as well (as much as one can be). 

Any similar experiences or insight much appreciated.

I know about that, but I wanted ask how likely is it really, if one was to try some 10mg oxycodone IR, to get addicted.. I am just curious, because every time someone posts about wanting to try oxy, so many people advise against it in a way that reminds me of the horror stories of DARE campaign.. as I said, I understand opiates are a very slippery slope, I just wanted to ask if I'm missing something? 

Thousands of people are given oxy's every year for acute short term pain, yet they don't become addicts.. how much more addicting is this stuff really, compare to say 100mg of tramadol or 150mg of codeine (10mg oxy I mean, as they should not be drastically different in terms of strength..)?? if one is in a good mental state (no trauma, depression, anxiety), is this stuff as addictive as it appears form the comments deterring people from trying it even once?? 

I understand that every addiction started with that first dose and it's always better to deter people in case they would like it too much, instead of glorifying it. But I wonder if the way people respond to first time use questions is not too over the top?? Did your view on life drastically change after the very first dose?? Could you not stop thinking about the feeling for a very long time, until you went for more?? 

I'm just trying to understand, as I have had codeine and tramadol (as well as lot of other non-opiate drugs) and while they were pleasurable and I always felt like having some more for 1-2 days after, that feeling always subsided... Is oxy really that different from both weaker opiates (codeine, tramadol) as well as other dopaminergic drugs (coke, dexies, ritalin, aderall)??

I'm just asking cause this is such a lovely community of supportive people and it kinda struck me how strongly you are trying to deter others from trying from trying opiates in a way that almost seems too over the top (DARE type propaganda).. I'm not saying that you are overstating the risks, that's basically what I'm asking about.. Would you say the replies are 100% accurate (trying it once poses a major risk), or are they perhaps influenced by you guys seeing opiates taking so much away from you and your loved ones (and therefore a bit overstated, due to emotional involvement)??

Sorry for the long set of questions, just wanted to clarify, hear some stories and maybe get a discussion going..

**Via Cliff**
Buy dope on pay day through Cliff, inevitably loan $100-$150 so he can have dope. Thus effectively halving that which is available for my immediate consumption while spending double. Sure, I'll eventually get it back. One time surprisingly mostly in cash but often in pill form which cannot be spent on bills, Amazon or in most retail stores. For returning readers, I need not list the times in which Cliff engaged in shady shenanigans but for the unfamiliar search for posts with the flair ""Cliffpost, and ""Cliff Post!"". Entering the search query as *flair:Cliffpost* and *flair:Cliff Post* in the right side search bar for this subreddit seems to find all of the flared Cliffposts.

&nbsp;

**Via Tim**
Buy through my long time friend Tim. Not an option anymore. After the second time I bought through him, he went to a local hospital that had sort of ""three day detox"" program followed by being inducted into a Suboxone program. I don't know if he fell off the wagon since last week, I hope he is still clean. In his words, ""I spent over forty grand in the past two years."" He told his wife that he went into the program for ""opiates"" because he'd be on the street if his wife knew he was on heroin. I spoke to him briefly today and he said he'll contact me in a couple of days as he has a busy night and day of work ahead of him. I only bought dope through Tim on two occasions but both times everything went smoothly. He took whatever I offered as a middling fee without complaint and even offered subsequent fair trades without making me feel pressured to trade. For example, ""would you like to trade some of your bags for this many subs?"" He was also cool because he fronted the dope for me and based on my good word.

&nbsp;

**Via Derrick**

Derrick is Cliff's primary middle and Cliff often tells stories about him pulling shady shit. I suspect about 50% of the stories are made up shit, some of them are projections of Cliff on fictitious personification of Derrick. Other times Cliff makes up stories about Derrick in order to explain why the current order is a little short. When Cliff first started getting dope, Derrick would give him bags (10 bags to a bun) that were taped shut. Derrick claimed the dealer did this to ensure that any middle wouldn't tamper with them. When Cliff met Derrick's dealer, the guy said he did not put tape on the bags. It turned out that Derrick was taking shit out of the bags then taping them shut to make it appear like he couldn't have.



After Tim went on the wagon, I decided to bypass Cliff and buy directly from Derrick. First order was three buns, I gave Derrick half a bun for middling. I figured if I was generous he would be less likely to scheme. For that and the subsequent order Derrick did state he didn't care about the middling fee, that he was just doing me the favor. Of course I knew he wouldn't middle out of the kindness of his heart. Well, that first order, instead of ten bags to a bun as Cliff normally gets, it was four fatter bags. Since I was to receive 2.5 buns, the first bag represented one full bun. The remaining three were supposedly half a bun each. Derrick emptied one out to show me how it broke up into a number of lines. Then upon departure he said ""check it out, let me know what you think.. if any of the bags appear too small, let me know and I'll tell the dealer so he can include an extra bag on the next order."" Pretty sketchy to me. I have no idea without a scale or a reference that I'm accustomed to such as the buns that are divided into ten bags. In Derrick's words, it was quicker to have the dope ready in this form. The reason Cliff always gets ten bag buns is because ""he's mad stingy.""


&nbsp;

**In Conclusion**

Doing business and getting dope through Cliff is risky and generally sucks. As a fellow opi redditor once said, ""Cliff makes doing dope unfun."" Dealing with Tim was sunshine and roses but it ended too soon and I really can't complain for the sake of his family life and well being. Derrick is shady AF. Nice enough guy, hasn't had an opportunity to screw me over and put me through tribulations like Cliff has. Hell, he gets blamed for some of the shit Cliff has done when it was totally Cliff. Nonetheless, It's not viable to do business with Derrick in lieu of Cliff with the expectation that I'll get a fair shake. With my current options I will not get a fair shake. Thus, I'm better of sticking with subs and keeping my money.

Now about that writer's conundrum. I've been writing a Cliffpost. Wrote it three times, three different ways but it keeps coming out long. My last attempt has good grammar and makes sense to read for the most part but it's just very long and I don't want to post a wall of text even if I keep the paragraphs neat separate. I'm tempted to seek an editor but I don't want to waste someone elses time. 


On another note, someone said ""if only you put such effort elsewhere, you could succeed at anything."" So before I wrote the most recent Cliffpost draft for the third time I spent over two hours working on a book. I always considered writing a book, well two types of books.. One educational and another fictional. I'm glad I spent time on that, I don't actually know how books are written and how people make some books so damn thick but with self publishing being a thing, it's a worth a shot to engage in such an undertaking.

Instead of getting high from benzos they just knocked me the fuck out eventhough I already lowered the dose a little. Had a great nights sleep though.

Then I drank some booze to get rid of the morning shakes, while I was taking a shit I did a shot of heroin. After I was done shitting I played a game ( more like making sure I didn't log out in a shit location the night before..

-crushing the dope (I get rocks a lot) into the FINEST powder I can get it.

-separating the lines so that each one is very narrow and small. I heard this helps it absorb better in the mucous membrane. Fat lines are tempting but it gets me higher to break a fat line into many smaller lines.

-barely snorting (so that it doesn’t go down the throat and cause oral ingestion and a drip). I almost always make sure now when I sniff the dope that I’m not doing it hard enough to make a loud noise with my nose.

-straw farther up the nose.

-I was told to try and putting a few drops of water in each nostril beforehand. This seems to work really well.

Currently, she is taking half of a 10/300 before she goes to bed. If the pain becomes too bad, she will take a second half of the tablet. She is only taking half a tablet because taking a full tablet makes her feel to groggy and spaced out the next morning. (She is a college professor, she needs to be ""on"" by the time she gets to her first class.) 

She also mentioned that the vicodin doesn't seem to be touching the pain. I have urged her to ask the doctor about the possibility of a stronger painkiller such as percocet, but she is hesitant about doing so because she figures that it will make her even more groggy the next morning. 

I figured that this would be a good place to ask for advice. I have two questions: First, in your experience, is percocet likely to be a more effective painkiller than vicodin? Second, do you find that percocet makes you groggier in the morning?

I subtly think my pharmacist may be a user. Maybe switching out legit stuff and keeping them? I don’t know. I’ve been short a pill or two at times, but never bitch cause he has never given me shit for filling a day or two early. These say on the bottle that they are Purdue. But they crumble apart with scissors.

This is a legit script, I just want them instant so I use the coke trick. Cut them up as small as possible. USUALLY they are a fucking pain, hard and gummy at the same time. But these break into tiny pieces. I can post pictures, but figured I’d start here

But these crumble. Like 2 cuts and they are broken up. I put a small piece in my mouth, and it gelled up but barely.

My fear is I take like 160mg at a time. If these weren’t legit, that would be bad.

I know he is on methadone, black, foilies of Coke, and I think that's all. Not completely sure. 
Do I need to be worried,? Because I am. Should I shoot him with the narcam I have, if I do he will get so pissed and maybe beat me up. If he needs an ambulance I would have to figure how to get someone 100+pounds on me whose paraniod from Coke to a car that is three small flights of stairs away plus I have a fake leg that I probably shouldn't add 200+ pounds too. Because I can't call an ambulance to my house especially for him especially for this reason. So I would need to know what to do quickly. 

Also something peculiarly odd is his pain tolerance is very low. I accidentally stepped on his foot. I had shoes he didn't. I didn't stomp or grind it or anything just accidentally stepped on it and now he is in excruciating pain. Keeps groaning and going oh my God grabbing his leg just acting like someone is driving a nail through it and it seems as though that shouldn't cause that much pain. Especially on dope methadone which should control pain and tons of euphoria from Coke and whatever else he may have taken/ the cuts in what he took.

How do you make yourself feel like you’re worth something again?","I’m sorry if this isn’t really allowed. I just don’t know what to do, and this community always seems so tight knit and supportive. 

I’m at the end of my rope. I’ve been a failure all my life, I live in the middle of no where, I have no license so getting a job is nearly impossible. I have no friends in my area, and the one light of my life, my boyfriend, is hundreds of miles away in the US, completely out of my reach. I haven’t seen him in months and it kills me. I don’t feel like I’ll ever see him again, especially my if I continue to be a failure at finding a job. He’s already paid for one plane ticket for me to visit him, I’m not going to ask him to waste his money on me like that again when I can never give him anything proper in return. 

In my depression I’ve turned hella suicidal and spend any moment I can trying to get high off whatever I can find. I’ve been mysteriously sick for years and throw up multiple times every day, I can barely keep any food down, I get malnourished and dehydrated regularly, and unless I have something for my nausea like weed, I just end up throwing up my food hours later. Doctors are incredibly dismissive of me. They all chock it up to anxiety or a pregnancy that simply cannot and does not exist, none ever want to run any real tests. 

I recently got kicked out of my apartment by my incredibly abusive roommates, they had me walking on eggshells 24/7, it destroyed me mentally. When I left I wasn’t able to take my bed home with me, so for months I’ve been stuck on a thin futon mattress that heats up like a furnace underneath me as I sleep, and I wake up every few hours drenched in sweat but freezing cold from the air of the basement. 

Every moment is miserable. I don’t know what to do anymore. If I wasn’t such a coward I’d kill myself, I probably just should. I’ve never done anything of worth in my entire life, the only good to happen to me was posting a single comment in a fan fiction forum that introduced me to my boyfriend and best friend for the better part of a decade, but I don’t think I’ll ever see him again. I know I cause him pain, too. He knows I’m sick and in pain and depressed to the point where he doesn’t know if I’ll be alive when he wakes up, and it causes him so much pain. He can’t sleep, he gets anxiety attacks and even his family’s noticed he’s been off kilter. I just drag everyone around me down. 

Is there any way to get out of a hole like this? Or am I really as fucked as I feel like I am. I just don’t know. Delete this if it’s too much of an off-topic rant, I don’t even know why I bothered typing this whole thing up. Guess I just needed to straighten out my thoughts. Some successful stories of people salvaging the shreds of their lives might help my outlook right now, if anyone has an uplifting tales...

Sorry again if this post isn’t really allowed. I just need someone to talk to ;-;",1523863975.0

Its been a little over a month-ish. (Dont know exactly when I stopped and i hate counting days).

This past week or so has been pretty brutal as far as cravings and anxiety go. It had been beating me down pretty hard and i was starting to begin the process of rationalizing a relapse. 

Tonight I said fuck it and ended up driving to a head shop to see if they sold kratom. I knew the chances of it being any good were slim and already held pessimistic views on its ability to be of any use in preventing a relapse despite all of the testimony to the contrary. But i was gonna give it a shot. So i bought a  bottle of bali capsules. And holy shit did they blow my mind. It was pretty subtle at first but after a while i began to feel like i had popped a couple vicodin. I only had to take 3gs too which was another surprise. I figured after a years long heavy habit such as mine, Id have to take at least 5gs to get any effect.

So definitely will be looking into vendors and buying more. The stuff i got from the head shop...i know its good but fuck its expensive. 15 bucks for 17 grams. Was mostly to find out if it would work and that it did. 

TLDR: skeptic decided to give kratom a shot before relapsing and was overwhelmingly satisfied. ",1523859402.0

(I'm a broke college student Atm) and ended up driving back to my home city over 2.5 hours away at 4 in the morning on Friday off some bars. I come back to reality while on my way to the city and kinda figure out why I was heading there since I had a rig and some other gear next to me. I ended up grabbing just one bag off a cold cop spot while waiting for my main dude to be ready in a few hours (It was 6am). I shot the bag and awake hours later to somebody knocking on my window telling me I need to get the fuck out there and get rid of the shit on my lap (rigs, ect) I then went and met up with my regular guy and decided I'd wait until I got back to college to use again so that wouldn't happen. I made it back safely and continued to use the small amount I had (6 bags) over the weekend. I woke up to the shower running and people knocking on the bathroom door needing to piss and seeming quite worried on I believe Saturday night and was nodding out the entire day for the most part. Today I have no used since I ran out and right away my body is so sore I can barley move and I'm having a real hard time remembering what I did this weekend and putting it into a timeline and just having overall awful depression and negative thoughts.
