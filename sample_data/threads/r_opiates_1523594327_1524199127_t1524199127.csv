Now, this is now a full proof plan, but these are two ways I have been hiding dope from myself that makes it pretty hard to find. 

1: In my house, there is a huge cabinet full of dvd cases. I simply close my eyes, spin a bit to disorient myself. Keep eyes closed. Pick out random case, take out dvd and lay it down so you only see silver. Keep your eyes closed. Then put dope where dvd went, close case, disorient yourself, and place in random spot. Then put the disc in a random spot. Key point, keep eyes closed.

2: Wall full of random books? Close your eyes, take out random thick book. Walk to another room without looking at book, open book without looking at cover. Cut out whole to stash your dope in the paper. Close eyes, close book, go back to bookcase, and put back book in a different spot. ",1524198500.0

So I’m 1200 miles from home until next Tuesday with my boyfriend, right? Well last night he basically called it off. While I’m 1200 miles away from home.

He said he’s not ready for a guy (we’re gay) in his life at this point and he thought he was. I’m glad he’s learning more about himself, but I wished it wouldn’t have been at my expense. I didn’t see this coming a million miles away. I can’t help but laugh because I should be so used to shit like this happening to me, but it always blindsides me.

I got really drunk last night and a friend of his held me while I cried. This is why I don’t drink, I embarrass myself.

Had I not been on the shot, getting high would be the first thing on my mind. And honestly, I’m half tempted to see if I can break through the shot. Yeah I know the risks, but I’m past the point of caring.

I think it might be what’s in the fucking dope out there right now. I don’t know. All I know it’s that not even a week of fucking around, literally not even a full .5 altogether,  I woke up yesterday dope sick. Not shit your brains out, projectile vomit (although I did projectile vomit once, it was weird), knocking on deaths door level. But still. Dope sick enough to make me remember why I never want to be in that cycle again. Fuck that. Anxiety, tired but can’t sleep, hot/cold sweats, restless as fuck but still can’t manage to actually function enough to leave the house. 

Maybe I needed this to remind myself why I cannot “just do a shot once in awhile”. Not worth it. Anyway....what the FUCK though? Is my brain just trained to associate doing dope, then not doing dope with withdrawal symptoms? Making me more sensitive to it ? Or is it my first guess, which is this dealer is a piece of shit and if there is any actual HEROIN in that dope, it’s kinda like a  “can I have some heroin with my fentynal please?” ratio. I know when I was regularly using for a year, Fent was just becoming a thing but I noticed the withdrawals were way worse. Even with no tolerance, I did like maybe half a tenth in the first shot, felt that orgasmic rush, literally woke up 4 hours later, so fucked up it didn’t even feel good, barely able to stand up and walk to get myself a water, nauseous, and it was actually not very pleasant. 

Thing is though, unlike fentynal dope I have ever done in the past (including pharmaceutical grade pure fent administered via IV in hospital), this dope had legs. I always hated Fent dope because it had no legs. This shit is every bit like any Fent dope I have ever fucked with except that it stuck around. 

Well, I’m feeling quite hopeless and grim at the moment but I know it’s temporary. But yeah, I’m getting back on the shot. Already have my appointment. I don’t want to die and that shit will surely kill me.

I’ve been doing drugs since high school and I thought I was invincible, xans, coke, acid, molly, etc.  I thought I couldn’t be addicted, that it was all in the head.  Boyyyy was I wrong.  It started in January 2017, im an 18 year old freshman in college and i was looking to score some oxys since I had done em a couple times before but never frequently, just opportune times.  A boy hooks me up with a dealer who had 20s.  It was awesome, I finally had a way to get oxys since they hd been so rare.  But the biggest problem was the fact that he always hd them, so I didn’t take days off because “who cares?”.  8 months straight of doing hella oxys and I’ve spent so much ducking money.  I can barely even afford them anymore so my plug tells me he can get me this other shit and it’s way cheaper.  That’s when I started with heroin, again it was awesome since it was cheap as hell, but as tolerance built I was in the same situation.

Towards the end of this year I had to face my problem... well that’s a lie, my parents caught me and I had to admit my problem mainly because I was broke and I couldn’t handle withdrawals.  So early this January they put me on subs... but it wasn’t that easy.  I still wanted to get fucked up, so whenever I got money I’d buy heroin and stop taking my subs,  2 months of this and getting caught 2 more times.  We are now in March and it’s time to do it for real.  I’ve been taking a sub a day since then and now I feel great.  I don’t crave opiates anymore, I never thought I would feel this way again.  Not having to worry about getting money to not be sick, just enjoying myself without this shit controlling me.

I know this same story has probably been said about 100 times by 100 different people, but it’s just my story.  My advice to any of you kids around my age that are thinking the same way turn the fuck around. You idiots who post pics of oxys and think it won’t take over your life and everyone else is just a junkie idiot but YOU can’t get addicted because your different.  Well guess what?  You aren’t different and if you keep taking this shit you will ruin your life.  Luckily I didn’t go as far as shooting and I’ve managed to maintain my college grades but who knows where I’d be if I went a couple months longer.

That drugs will make it so the only thing you want is more drugs, at any cost. mom has heroin and you don't? you're going to stabville. yes even pot will evoke matricide. they have been teaching it this way for decades. if you are american, you know all about the ridiculous  drug education programs. guess what adults? the programs  are still mostly the same ridiculous propaganda. well My nephew and his friends, seniors and jocks, were so  astonished people could drive high, i questioned more .( they smelled weed from my friends car). They All were naive enough at 18, to still be  believing, that even with weed you can't control your self while high. i asked and found it's all the same shit still being taught. thus this post   SooooooooooooooO TEENAGERS LISTEN:  No, weed wont ruin your life. lsd doesn't make you jump out of tall buildings, and crack/ heroin are not addictions caused by one time use. You See, foolish as this sounds, we called their bluff on addiction. after being taught the same lies, we tried every drug. interestingly, we had not become addicts. obviously  they lied. They lied about everything except opiates. OPIATES Are not to be Fucked with. You will be dependent! it will control you. even as little as twice or once a week of controlled use can/will have you waking up dopesick, and unsure how weeks have passed since that 'control'. it doesn't take many days to get the ball rolling. IVE SMOKED CRACK/cocaine  scores of times/ Some times 3-4 dayS in a row. PERSONALLY I never had any withdrawal or cravings from coke.(this is just me though). BUT IVE BEEN A physically dependent heroin addict for over a decade! I don't have a problem with any of the other drugs. heroin will own you, it's undefeated. do not start using it.  they were not lying about opiates. now that you have the truth,  live life and find your joy. just do it  any where except in opiates. you're not special and you can't beat heroin  addiction's first enslavement. eventually it will take control of your priorities and strong or weak the end result is the same. YOU will choose heroin over everything when with drawling. no human has won.  you will be sweating, but bone cold. shit while puking from the toilet. the  only break from that is sneezing in fits, and pausing to routinely keep  wiping off the sweat on you. then you will be back to shitting ,while shivering. sound fun?

I’m pretty aware of the main downsides to methadone. It would be annoying to be on a short leash like that, but I can’t afford to travel much anyway. Living at home with my mom, going to school right here soon, and I know there’s a couple clinics to choose from within ~20 mins of me. 

I avoided maintenance for years. I was so good at hiding the worst of my habits from my family. I didn’t want to commit to being opioid dependent forever but I realized I was already there so I got on subs. Please, please don’t say anything about how hard methadone is to get off of. I know. I can handle that side of things.

So I don’t wanna write too much here, happy to answer any questions in the comments. My main problems are depression and cravings. I’m getting really depressed on subs and wasting money trying to use. I haven’t taken methadone in years but it seems like it could be what I need. ",1524164262.0

But last night I smoked a bowl pack after doing my little dose and I was like full on nodding harder than I ever have before and it lasted like 3 hours. It was nuts. 
 
I regularly take benzos that are prescription. Usually 2mg of kpin and 2mg of Xanax at night with a benedryl or a trazadone to sleep so it takes a lot to make me drowsy.

Last night I only took 2 kpins and no Xanax or trazodone. Normally that does nothing with such a small little bump of dope just a good relaxing feeling before bed.  The only difference was this time I smoked a bowl pack of weed and I was nodding so hard I was scared to sleep and stayed up until 4am when it totally wore off.

About noon yesterday I did a full point from the same batch and a full point again around 4 from same batch and it was super mild. That .04 at 11pm knocked me out hard and it was less than half of the earlier doses.

I'm going to make this short
My hamster has
 25 klonopin.
A gram and a half of H

Every time my hamster takes 3mg of klonopin and a decent shot of heroin he blacks out within minutes.

So the question I want to know is..

How much klonopin can I take before I do my dope that will not cause me to black out?

Now you’re in my thoughts 
I get lost I get nauseous  
All these thoughts 
All these thoughts 
So toxic 
So toxic 
That I lost it
That I lost it.
Without you I almost drowned
But I swam through and Now I found 
That I won’t find you in my crowd
And all these shows (?) won’t hold me down
I detach myself
You put me through hell
I knew you too well
You don’t deserve my help.
I don’t know if I will be the same
I know that you’re never gonna change
You told me to find a way to grow
Held your hand and watched you let it go
I’ll never know if we were just dreaming 
I let it go but I still believe in (?)
That this love can take us places
I still love the time we wasted.

Note: God = God, the universe, your respective God by name, or a stand-in for gosh, goodness or golly.. Nonetheless, the three words for OMG are what I naturally blurted out upon hearing that which I shall share exclusively right here right now.

&nbsp;


Earlier today I woke up, communicated with Cliff and upon getting paid, arrangements were made. A week ago I took $100 dope and cash on loan. Why? Well I decided I didn't mind biking to the ATM on his behalf with his card if I was gonna be given dope right after. I did get dope right after and all went according to plan aside from getting home at 6AM but that was because I was playing games on my new-old-new laptop and making plans to see the new Avengers movie. 


Yesterday went extremely well. I didn't feel like anyone acted particularly shady, I got my money's worth every which way. First I got exactly one bun from Cliff minus the middler's fee for our middle. Then later after work I was like ""you know, I want more but I didn't buhy more earlier because I didn't want to expose myself to shenanigans or tempt Cliff or faith."" Yeah, that quote pretty much sums up my thought process.

&nbsp;

Thus I contacted Derrick for a half, then realized he was actually walking to his guy to pick it up and front it so I upgraded to a full bun, I only asked for a half because I thought he was gonna pull from personal stock. He took only one bag and it was all fat and good dope. Shortly after that, which occurred after work.. I ate dinner then paid a visit to Cliffords house.

&nbsp;


Well first to get to the point of this post, something I assure shall amuse you, or anger you, or bubble up some sense of obligation that makes you urge me to contact adult protective services, I must rewind to how things got to the OMG moment.


&nbsp;

Before work I drop by Cliff's hoping the dboy/middle would show up before I had work. He didn't, he showed up 10 minutes after I left for work so I had to bike back on my break. I couldn't wait a minute longer than I did and still be on time so I cut temporal losses.


Upon arriving at Cliff's his TV wasn't in the living room. I thought he was just dope sick and too lazy to move his TV but it turned out that the electrical power was turned off in his and his mom's apartment. To watch TV and to maintain power to the internet modem/router he ran an extension cord from his sister's dwelling. Strangely, he didn't even power the fridge. Just the TV, blu-ray player and modem. The modem became useless too after the cable company turned that off. I guess both of those bills were due today.

&nbsp;

So if not for the fact that I owed Cliff $100 from last week, he would have no way to get dope and when given a choice between electricity and dope he chose dope. Well, can't fault him for that.. I'm sure many of us have done similar lol.


&nbsp;

Okay, well, now that we got the setup out of the way here goes the mess of a punchline!


As some may know, every two weeks Cliff then his mom gets their roxy script. Cliff has to share some with is mom because she shares some with him. It'd be easier for her if she simply said ""I'm keeping mine for me, and you keep yours for you"". Sort of like what I did to bring my costs down so that I could buy electronics and bike parts. I'm not dooing perfect, in that I shouldn't be buying dope for myself at all but if I'm gonna buy dope I want to make sure I take care of Numero Uno first and foremost. 


I mean like, if his mom didn't have to share with him, she'd have more and wouldn't need him to give her any when it was his script day. I would say the inverse applies to Cliff but he doesn't have the discipline to conserve a script without having to tap other sources. I mean yeah, I've seen him go through just 5 roxies 15's in one day but I don't really know if he was that conservative that day when he said he was. It's conceivable... but not the point of this tale.

&nbsp;

His mother has bad knees and she has been prescribed various opioids for over a decade. I remember when she used to get vikes. Sometimes I'll hear Cliff's mom moan and demand or request ""something to take"" from Cliff. If he is honestly at the bottom of the barrel he'll ask me, ""do you have any ibuprofen or Tylenol?"" They've bought bottles of acetaminophen...who cares how it's spelled but they disappear in no time once either one of them runs out of roxies. 


So like, what's worse is... there are times where Cliff will get blues between script days so he'll give some to his mom to take.. but of course she usually takes 15mg roxies so he'll break the blue in half. Then she'll complain she only got half. It's tough. The other day she actually wanted a second goblin and Cliff was like ""you gotta wait for it to take effect"", in fact that was right after he gave his last legit scripted pill to her.

&nbsp;


Finally, this evening Cliff was telling me what he did earlier that day. First the light stuff, at some point days ago he gave his mom 4mg of Suboxone and she slept really well. Sleep is something that comes hard for her, and when she don't get sleep she might be miserable enough to bug Cliff about all manner of bullshit shenanigans. From food to bills. Heck, if Cliff is too lazy to get up and she gets up and falls.. that's a whole operation so a sleepy Cliff's mom usually results in an undisturbed Cliff.


&nbsp;

Oh my gosh, I still didn't get to the point!


Alright here goes.... Cliff told his mom that a bag of Heroin was ""pure oxy"" and told her she could take it one of two ways. She took it and said the oxy was really good, felt good, licked the pain and all. 


ughhh... oh my God, jeeze, fuck.. like really? I'm just flabbergasted here. If flabbergasted could make a sound that sounded like a stuttering platypus, that's sort of me right now while pronouncing the word flabbergasted.

I had the day off so that I could go to therapy and I figured I’d end the latest binge and get back on the right track. Went to therapy sick as fuck and left my phone in my car. When I came back out I had a message from ol’ girl to come through and of course my addict brain said fuck everything lets get well. I picked up a friend and we drove to meet this chick. Long story short, we get to her around 4pm and we didn’t leave until about 7-7:30. Her plug had her driving all over the goddamn place while we waited at her house. I was going fucking nuts because at this point I was more fucking dopesick and losing my patience. This bitch  had us waiting at a gas station for an hour, then we had to drive 20 minutes to her apartment, and then we sat there for another two hours before ol middle girl finally came through. At that point I could’ve just taken the sub and been fucking fine, but noooooooooo I’m a fucking dipshit. And then she comes back with some RP 30s (they’re legit but meh). I had heard that these were being pressed around here so I fucking get out my narcan as my friend fucking chews a whole one and I stay sick for another 15 or so minutes until I realize that she isn’t gonna fall out (I was driving so I didn’t wanna do one of mine and risk ODing). I’m a paranoid motherfucker.

Tl;dr was gonna get back on subs but didn’t and waited three ours to get 30s even though I could’ve technically just taken it and said fuck the waiting game.

-

Maintenance arguably  shouldn't be a first attempt to get clean approach except in severe immediate life-threatening cases, and id agree with that as it IS a huge commitment(although this argument has become weaker with practically every opioid now at risk of containing fent)


-

But anyone considering it. You NEED to realize. Methadone withdrawals are so demonized due to people 1)rushing off of it, it should be SLOWLY tapered at 2mg/week tops, more like 1mg/week once you get below 30mg as that's the hardest part 2) people who could turkey in jail, because that IS the worst withdrawals ever

-

When correctly slowly tapered though, withdrawals ARE NOT BAD WHATSOEVER. Not even 5% as bad as the heroin withdrawals you're trying to evade 

-

It kills cravings better then fuckin anything. There's a reason that NA and inpatient rehab have SUCH a high relapse rate- afaik maintenance has the best clean -off-illicit opioid rate by a LANDSLIDE. Getting kicked off at most clinics is basically like you have to be TRYING to get kicked off(violence at the clinic etc.). As long as you stay away from benzos, most clinics will NOT kick you off for any other drugs, or at the least will let you go years and years before threatening it. This isn't ANYTHING remotely like pain management where one dirty and you're done

-

Think about how often you drive - and WAIT - and someti!we wait only to be ducked or burned by a drug dealer. The clinic WILL be open every mornimg, they won't have a dry spell or even a single day of running out, and most have a very short wait time. It can be annoying going every vday, but he realistic about the alternative. How many times have we sworn, tried, and failed to quit on our own.....

-

 If you've been to inpatient rehab multiple times and relapsed as soon as you got home, be fucking realistic about the odds of it REALLY helping and stickng or being different this time around

-

Fuck the stigma, and talking down about it and BY FAR WORSt of ALL, disuading those who are stuck in addiction and can't get out for the life of them. Your crybaby antics of talking people out of maintenance IS costing people their lives

-

It took me almost 2 decades of use before I finally gave in to get on maintenance. WHhy? Because of people IRL and online talking about it in a way to perpetuate its stigma. THAT is why I take this shit so fucking personal.

-

so if YOU had a bad experience with maintance, I'm not saying that you can never discuss your experience. But be honest about the real reason why it didn't work for you, and if you can't do that or are only doing it to try to make sure no one new gets on it, then maybe you should try shutting the fuck up. You could save a life just by doing so.",1524138428.0

8ddqpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ddqpi/the_subway_station_christ/,3,https://redd.it/8ddqpi,Stadtmitte,The Subway Station Christ,"The first time that I walked through the (name redacted) subway station- back in my undergrad years before I had ever really seen heroin in the flesh, let alone having it become the focal point of my life- I was disgusted, unnerved, and mildly intrigued. The junkies panhandling there sat side by side, arms wrapped around bony knees, murmuring a small thanks anytime a passerby dropped a coin in their cups (always from a distance, as if to avoid catching whatever soul-disease they had). When the crowds were thin, they'd break out the foil and smoke their dope in the open. However, that was rare, and most of the time they would just sit in silent agony, sweating and stinking. When I passed by them on the way to school, I couldn't help but sneak a furtive glance, curious to see something that most people appeared to try not to look at. I vividly remember watching one pick up the stub of a cigarette to find it had some tobacco still packed in it.

How the hell could somebody do that to themselves? I wondered. I was no stranger to masochism, but the level of shamelessness and lack of fucks given by these homeless junkies exceeded anything I had ever seen. Most people ignored them, but there were plenty of dirty looks. Unfazed, the junkies held out their cups. They shot up and smoked up in front of kids, in front of elderly tourists. If the police came, they dragged their ragged asses up and away for about 15 minutes, then settled right back down. For all I know, they even slept there. Sleep, beg, dig through garbage, shoot up, repeat. What a life. Every day I passed by them, I sneaked a peek and imagined what they were thinking. When I became hooked myself, I understood completely. One day you're the master's student, the next you're living out of garbage cans.

Near the end of my study abroad semester, I was walking through the same station to go study for final exams. One of the regular junkies – the one with the filthy long black corpse-hair and roman nose - sat in his usual spot, eating something no doubt dug out of the trash bin next to him. Two companions nodded off next to him, evidently having recently shot up. Above him, the electronic subway sign read in loud words “No stops here today-- train driving through.” Some sort of maintenance on the line. This meant that, as opposed to the usual train rumbling to a slow stop to allow the passengers off, the train would barrel straight through the station onto the next one, fast as hell and loud as you can imagine. I always stood as far back as I could when the trains drove through, just an instinctual human reaction to stay the fuck back from theses steel beasts. You could really feel the power as they clanged and chugged and rumbled through- *don't fuck with me, i'll eat you up, step right up and see if you can stop me*! They flew by so fast you couldn't even make the individual cars up, making it look like one giant single machine. 
	

For the first time, when I was furtively staring at the junkies, he raised his eyes from the floor and met mine. I heard the rumbling from the depths of the tunnels behind me. The junkie's eyes were blue and wide and full of some sort of distant emotion- longing, maybe? Desire for something that doesn't exist, or maybe never did? He stared at me for a full 5 seconds, not blinking, not moving. The rumbling grew louder. Putting his mangy hands on the floor (I noticed he was missing a finger), he pushed, coming to a crouch and an unsteady stand. A rig dropped from his pocket. The rumbling came to a roar and my bones vibrated with the telltale sign of the train about to pass through the station. 

The junkie's expression changed in an instant- his eyes brightened, the ragged folds of his mouth curled to a soft smile, and his posture erect. He lost 10 years of age in a second. His sporadic teeth looked like tombstones in an ancient graveyard, but they accentuated his smile. I found myself unconsciously reaching for my wallet, feeling for some reason that I needed to give him cash, lots of it, maybe everything I had, because I KNEW he would use it to turn his life around, that he would clean up and settle down and come back to life, I could help him, that he would change the world with his greatness. What I felt in him was something so powerful, so compelling, that this one smile would lead to two lives changed- his getting clean, and me finding whatever fulfillment I was seeking and conquering whatever loneliness that filled my life. I felt my life in his smile. 

I opened my mouth to ask him his name when he stepped forward. He walked slowly, erect, Christlike. He brushed me aside, focusing on something behind me. He hadn't even seen me at all. He took another step forward. The train emerged, flying with reckless abandon from the far end of the tunnel. The junkie smile and stepped forward off the edge of the platform as the train barreled through, the smile never leaving his face.

When I first tried heroin, much later, his face came to mind. 4 years later and that junkie is me, and you can be damned sure that this ""opting-out,"" the quickest way out of addiction, just a train-station away, is always and forever at the back of my mind.

What I mean is, for example, if someone does heroin and is overdosing and given Narcan, it will block the opiate receptors in the brain but the heroin would still be detectable in their system for the normal amount of time heroin is detectable, right?

And because this, apparently, is the kind of knowledge I have that I can pass along to the next generation, here I am. At least until they let me give this talk to kindergartners (again) or offer Junkie 101 at the community college.

We're gonna talk about three things: What to Do, How to Do It, and What Not to Do. My goal is to make this as easy as possible and instill a sense of confidence in the people who think copping drugs is too hard or too dangerous. If anyone has anything to add please chime in and I'll add it to post. I'd like this to be a community effort that, in the spirit of harm reduction, can help people stay safe in what is one of the less dangerous, but more nerve-wracking, parts of addiction.

#What to Do

There are a few ways to cop your drug of choice, but they all basically break down to one of two ways: open-air shopping or using a middleman.

Of the two, open-air markets are the logistically easier, but psychologically harder of the two. Most of the time just living in a city will make you familiar with the ""bad part of town."" When it isn't obvious which neighborhoods are shitty just Google for heroin busts, prostitution arrests, violent crime, and the like.

Once you know where you're doing you need to know what to do. For that I invite you to the next section.

The second method - using a middle - is less psychologically taxing than doing the dirt yourself, but presents it's own unique challenges. Of these, the one most posted is, of course, *""How do I find a middle?""* You're obviously looking for an entree into the world of degeneracy, so let me ask - if you're looking for a junkie, where would you find them?

Narcotics Anonymous meetings are a sure-fire way to meet junkies and methadone/Suboxone clinics are, by definition, full of people currently skull fucked on various poppy-related products. The downside here is, obviously, these are places where people go to get help with their addictions and while, yes, you're looking for help too it's kinda in the opposite direction of the help generally offered in these locales. If you can square it with your conscience then these are places full of helpful junkies... *Who you're going to drag back into the gutter, you horrible, horrible human being.* (Kidding... Well, mostly kidding.)

As mentioned by /u/billinsandiego, a good number of people attending AA/NA meetings are there because it's court ordered (Obviously, since each is independent, this depends on the meeting - location, time, etc.) Also, traditionally while you may be called out in the room and asked to leave, it's unlikely that law enforcement would be called for anything short of disrupting the meeting. Law enforcement, in general, leave the rooms alone because it's viewed as a helpful tool in helping people get clean. (In other words don't stand up and say, *""Hi, my name is Needa Hookuplz and I'm looking for a hook-up... Please.""* Try to be a bit smoother than that.) Finally, to increase your odds of finding a middle while expanding your network of fellow addicts it pays to look for meetings with a featured guest speaker as opposed to the normal, more casual meetings. *(Thanks /u/billinsandiego.)*

Aside from a junkie-buddy, your next option is going to be finding a more tertiary introduction. Homeless dudes literally live on the street and they know it better than you know the layout of your living room. Asking one for help finding street-based degeneracy is like asking a fish to find water. Prostitutes are in the same boat, albeit their's is more *Love Boat* and less refugee raft made of old oil drums and desperation. As a bonus, the homeless and the professionals are less likely to try and bleed you slow as a price for middling - but that's discussed below.

Prostitutes bring us to the newest (and most likely filled with bullshit and scams) way to find what you're looking for - the internet. Setting aside Dark Net Markets (which have been written about before by people much, much smarter than me - check out /r/darknetmarketsnoobs as a starting point; thanks to /u/spiritualasf for reminding me about that subreddit) you can use Craigslist, Backpage, and other internet classifies-style sites to find not only professional women but also, using the correct search terms, legit dealers.

*(I'm not 100% sure on what all the common drug-related search terms are, so if anyone would like to help me out with a list, I'd appreciate it. Also maybe a list of the most common drug-scams? This is out of my wheelhouse. Thanks.)*

#What Not to Do

Okay, so you've found a shitty 'hood. You've got money, transportation, and a need that can only to be filled with suspicious powders. So it's time to trade that money for those powders.

A lot of what I'm about to say is a mixture of common sense and street smarts. The next section, What Not to Do, will detail the Don'ts so you can avoid getting robbed, scammed, hurt, or arrested. This section is more the prototypical what I'd tell the nervous hood newbie before sending him out to sink or swim.

First, you need to know your local slang for the drug you want. Asking for *""One heroin please!""* is a good way to get your pockets ran. When I first moved to Chicago I had no idea what the fuck *""blows""* were - I always thought blow equaled coke - and correcting them by saying, *""No, I need a gram of heroin,""* had me turned away a few times before I caught on.

If you're in a car (which I highly recommend until you have more experience with the area) make the block once or twice to, hopefully, catch anything untoward - parked police cruisers, vacant-eyed creepy children, eldritch aliens, whatever. Once you're comfortable, pull up, locked doors, only the driver's window down, and place your order.

Some sets do hand-to-hands - money-to-drugs - some will have you give your cash to one guy and get your dope from another, hell, some might have fucking delivery pigeons. For the most part, however, it will happen in one stop, one transaction. Being asked to hand over the cash, pull away/make the block/part over there, isn't unheard of, but unless I knew that's how the set operated I never let my money walk more than a few feet away. Once that cash is in their hands it's theirs - ain't like you can co complain to a cop. Keep that in mind.

But, more importantly, is to remember that they're running a business. Unhappy customers don't come back, so burning you once for $100 is worth way less than someone coming back regularly. That's not to be said it never happens, so be cognizant of the situation around you. Avoid buying from single individuals - try to buy from a full-on set at a corner or on a stoop; don't fuck with randoms walking around. People alone could be hooked into a crew, or the could be freelancers - or they could be looking for an easy mark - while dudes sitting around in a group are obviously organized and doing more serious dirt then Scruffy Jimmy just ambling around.

Lastly - get a phone number from them. Calling ahead to make sure they're on can save you a ton of bullshit. Bullshit which could lead you to making poor decisions in the name of trying to make something happen. Pro-tip: avoid all possible flavors and varieties of bullshit.

Being on foot has many of the same considerations as copping in a car, just with the tension upped a bit. You'll still need to have your entry and exit planned - including alternate routes. You still need to carry the minimum cash necessary. I'd only take my ID, cash, and burner phone. Keep your cash somewhere secure, but easy to get to. You don't want to fumble around in a wallet while your dealer is looking at you like the world's saddest moron. Like I've said, Street Shit 101.

Exiting the area is the same on foot as it is in a car. Get in, cop, get out. Don't stop a block away to fix in your car or shoot up in an alley. You just open yourself up to getting harassed by the desperate or despicable - homeless and cops, respectively. Get home before you fix, but if you absolutely can't wait, well, sorry, but fixing in public is beyond the scope of this guide.

Lastly, let's talk about getting stopped. While I've seen and used a ton of ways to mitigate this eventuality (because it *will* happen, eventually) and dealing with the police is something every criminal needs to know how to do - and, ideally, do well - the fact is that being in a shitty neighborhood isn't a crime. The easiest way to avoid getting arrested after buying drugs is to not do anything illegal... Well, anything *else,* I suppose.

In other words, keep your papers (license, insurance, registration, and tag) up to date. Have no rigs, straws, cookers, or other paraphernalia in your car. Assume that if it's hidden, no matter how well, it can be found - because it can. And as much as it sucks, at the end of the day, swallowing your drugs is *way* better than catching a charge. *(And yes, CPD, I'm still pissed about needing to swallow that dope on fucking Christmas Eve, you holly, jolly, Christmas-ruining fucks.*) I keep an open 20 oz. bottle of coke exactly for this reason.

*An aside here - I've had the debate of hidden versus trashed way too many times. If you've got faith that your boy-pussy won't be probed, then, by all means store whatever you want in your sin cave. I'd rather just re-buy my dope than risk it, but hey, you do you... And do that boy-pussy goooood.*

Okay, so that's how you conduct yourself in an open-air market, but what are the niceties in dealing with a middle? We've talked about *where* and *how* to find them but what do you do once one if on the hook?

First off - felonies aren't free. It might cost you ten bucks or ten thousand. They might want you to buy them their own bag, or a rock, or a bottle. The point is that be ready to pay them for their help. It might be a tricky issue to breach, but talking upfront about what they're expecting will leave both parties in a better position. Overpay, underpay, haggle - do whatever you want, but be ready to pay *something.*

Buying their connect - outright paying for an introduction - is almost always going to be easier and cheaper in the long run. You'll pay less, over time, but more importantly you'll never be on Middle-man Time. (Just Dealer-Time, but that's something else.) They might balk, but offering more cash or threatening to walk away is an easy way to call the bluff. Damn near every dealer in the world wants more customers. Just taking the number (off their phone or yours if they use it) works but so does tire iron applied to a kneecap - like I've said, you do you.

That being said... 

Never let your money walk. If it's too good to be true it probably is. Never put more money in their hand than you're comfortable losing. Never let them discuss the deal with you able to hear at least their side of the conversation. Never let them handle the dope without you watching. If they're sick don't trust a single word they say. Spend every minute thinking about how they could fuck you - because I guarantee they're thinking of the perfect way to bend you over. As above - Hood Shit 101. I could give you a dissertation on street smarts, but, really, you either get it or you don't. Everyone gets taken a few times at first - they're just expensive lessons.

#What Not to Do

Above all I want to say this - if you're scared to cop because you think you'll ""be robbed"" or ""thrown in jail"" then you should really reevaluate whether or not drugs are a good hobby for you. *(Also it's kinda racist that you think just because you're a honky in the hood you're gonna get mugged or jammed up by 12.)* Ninety-nine times out of a hundred dealers are just dudes trying to make ends meet. In other words, they're people - just like me and thee.

That being said, there are ways to avoid being a victim of that last one percent. Be respectful, direct, and distantly polite. Make eye contact but don't stare. Carry yourself like you have a reason to be there. Don't dress overly flashy or carry expensive shit - purses, jewelry, phones. Don't *ever* talk shit because there is always someone willing to cash that check. Obviously, if you're white, don't say racist shit. *(The number of newbies I've seen that thought they could say ""Nigga"" in a roomfuls of bangers is stupidly high.)* Don't ask questions about their operation, their set, or how they function. Don't use overly precise terminology since it seems cop-ish and makes people nervous. Don't carry a weapon because it escalates the situation, any possible criminal charges, and you're way more likely to get hurt if you have one. *(You are not Rambo or John Wick. You're reading an internet guide about how to buy drugs on the street for Mother Morphine's sake. If anything screams, ""I don't need to a carry a gun"" more than that, I'll be fucked if I know what it is.)*

Just don't act like a tourist and, most likely, you'll be fine.

#Expanded, Additional Points

**- Copping As a Female**

While I'm not a woman, I've had a few junkie lovers and a few platonic female friends so I can draw from their experiences.

Being female changes the situation some, and in some pretty significant ways, but the base calculus mostly remains the same. Some dealers/middles might offer to trade drugs for sexual favors. It's depressingly common, and most prostitutes I've known started out pimped by their significant other or by preforming their first commercial sex acts with their dealers.

Some people might be more protective of females. As the risk of sounding like a racist *(build der wall, ya'll - /s)* Mexicans culture has a ton of extra machismo lying around and I've seen that translated as a degree of extra respect towards and protection for women. Take that statement with a grain of salt.

A female will get a harder look from a cop than a man, but the cop is less likely to push the issue and let you go. Searching/dealing with chicks is different and requires resources which might not be readily available.

The dangers largely remain the same, but with the added danger of sexual violence. The trade-off is that violence against a woman, or scamming a woman, is a bit rarer than against a man. That plus being able to more easily approach other women (minus prostitutes - they're easier to approach as a dude) and the added arsenal of feminine wiles - if one chooses to employ them - would make copping, in my opinion, easier for a chick than a man.

My biggest piece of advice to a female junkie would be this: be leery of accepting favors, freebies, or fronts from a dealer. Maybe he's just a cool dude doing you a solid, or maybe he's looking to get repaid in a way you might not be cool with. Just something to consider.

*(this section was added based on the question and recommendation of /u/ak47revolver9. i should have considered the difference between the sexes in the original post. thank you, ak.)*


**- A Final Note on Middles.**

The chief rule to remember when working with a middle is that, *They are not your friend.* Maybe they will be, one day, but until that chilly day in Hell they are, most likely, just working the calculus on fucking you over. Hell, even if they're a friend they're probably still doing that math.

Remember - you're subsiding for their habit. Would you want to give up working with someone who's paying you to cop dope when you were already going to cop dope? Nope - me either, so they really won't want let you go once you're on the hook. 

Be prepared that if they don't want to play ball and sell you the connect's information or you can't find a way to get the number yourself, then it's time to break out the big boy panties and act like you belong in the hood. Walk up with your middle once the transaction has been talked about on the phone. Refuse to let your money walk even a few feet away. Don't let them discuss the deal outside of earshot and never let the middle handle the drugs. Don't buy into the line, *""My guy don't like meeting new people,""* because I've never seen a dealer who's good with turning away customers. Explain to your middle that things can be done your way, and he can get a little something, or he can try to fuck you around until you tell him to kick rocks and then he gets nothing. There's always another middle.

Like I said - wear them big boy panties and act like you belong on these streets.

*(Thanks to /u/Mu_Kappa_Delta for pointing out that getting the middle out of the picture as fast as possible is almost always the best practice.)*


#Last Words

This isn't meant to be the end-all, be-all, dogmatic how-to guide to buy drugs. These are my personal recommendations based on personal experience, things I've seen, junkie camp-fire stories, and dope-fiend Apocrypha. For every person buying, selling, or middling dope there's a different way to do it. As long as you don't end up hurt, robbed, or arrested you've done it right.

I'm happy to answer any questions, expand on any of this, or incorporate any good points or suggestions into the body of the post. As comments and discussion come in I'l update this post, and thanks to everyone who's helped with comments, suggestions, and critiques.

 Held to the side it's much golder 

Either way I feel less colder 

I see a silver lining 

Life becomes a series of trying

Only living when you stop dying

Only grounded when your up, flying 

Smiling, beaming and shining 

Calling  the broken and beaten 

Who open their hearts when they're speaking 

Awaking the stirring and sleeping 

Untying the past they're entwined in.

Yet we tread, tired; the golden mile 

So each day contains a smile 

And might just be reconciled 

Between familiar  black lining.

I was in a winter storm 
Frozen over
Trying to keep warm

Your rays came down 
They melted my snow
I watched the streams
Frozen, to the ground, flow

They said you were hot
I couldn't see that
I just felt the warmth
And I wouldn't look back

I needed you closer
No more frozen days
I became addicted
To your warm rays

You weren't close enough 
I did all I could do
I left earth
To be closer to you

Yes, it was warm 
They said you would burn
But feeling your heat
Was my only concern

I left the ground
Now flooded with water
Everything was drowned 
I couldn't even bother 

Finally I was close
So close it burned
For you, within my reach
Said I could not learn

My branches caught fire
I screamed in pain
I hated the sun
For ever calling my name",1524093368.0

Back in November I got arrested and charged with forgery (a class C felony in the US) and possession of stolen property (a misdemeanor in the US). I am a first time offender. I have been able to get the misdemeanor charge dropped, but am still facing charges for forgery. 
My lawyer tried to get me diversion through the prosecuting attorneys office but I was rejected from entering the program. 
At this point, there's a possibility I will get the chance to get the opportunity to do drug court. Drug court is a 12-24 month program where you have to submit to weekly monitored UAs, have a nightly curfew, have to live in halfway or sober housing, have a mandatory minimum amount of meetings to attend, have to appear in court weekly, and must be attending treatment (inpatient, intensive outpatient, and then outpatient). During your weekly court date if you have any violations you will face jail time. A lot of people end up spending 24 months in the drug court program and end up serving more time than if they would have just pled guilty. If you don't successfully complete drug court you get the maximum penalty allowed by law for your crime. For me that would be up to 10 years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines. If you do successfully complete drug court, you are not convicted of your crime.
My other option is to see what kind of deal I can get for pleading guilty. I'd have to take the felony  conviction for forgery but I would serve probably 90 days at the most... I could potentially get away with not doing any more jail time at all, and just spend time on probation.

Anyone have any input/feedback for me? ",1524088974.0

I smoked a bit in the morning until I was feeling pretty good then did a tiny little bit bigger shot then I normally do and I immediately felt it. I was struggling to keep my eyes open to rinse my rig out and when I was done and ended up throwing up afterwards and was on the floor of my bathroom nodding out over the toilet bowl for a good 20 minutes or so. Then afterwards I had a gnarly headache and I was puking periodically throughout the day. And this was like a migraine type headache too it was awful.

I usually practice excellent harm reduction techniques and am able to register on the first poke. 
Unfortunately, due to a combination of not being able to make it to the needle exchange last week and missing my shot because I was in a rush to do it in a public bathroom, I ended up with an abscess. 
In the past I've missed a few shots here and there and ended up with a pretty angry feeling lump for a few days that ends up going away on its own. Not this time! I got a lump where I missed my shot and it got more swollen, red, and painful as the days went by until it caught the attention of a medical professional. I  convinced the doctor that it wasn't *that* bad but he told me if it got any worse to get medical attention.
Of course, my abscess continued to get worse until I couldn't take it anymore and went to have it looked at. On Sunday I had to have it ""lanced"" and ""drained"". (By ""lanced"" I mean they used a scalpel to make about a half inch long incision. By ""drained"" I mean the doctor squeezed the abscess with every ounce of strength she had, and then proceeded to use tweezers, the scalpel, and god-knows-what-else to root around under my skin to find more places to squeeze.) Once the doctor was satisfied, the incision was then packed with some gross yellow antibacterial fabric. Finally, I was prescribed a week of antibiotics and advised to have my dressing changed daily at any urgent care or emergency room until further notice. 
""Until further notice""... Hmm... Interesting word choice, right? Let me explain what that apparently meant... ""Until further notice"" meant that even though I think I'm getting my dressing repacked and changed, I am actually probably going to be getting my arm scalpeled open and violently drained until further notice. Yep, I've had the same abscess cut to pieces, squeezed, poked, and prodded for the last 3 days straight. It doesn't get any less painful either. I can't wait until this thing can start healing!

So what's the moral of the story? Don't ever compromise your safety by not practicing excellent harm reduction techniques. 

Anyone else have some abscess stories to share to make me feel less gross right now? ",1524086139.0

It’s been real.","After using since 2008, which started as a once in a while thing, and then getting my first taste of physical withdrawal in 2011, it’s been a long nine-and-a-half years.  I’m tired.  Tired of sitting in cars in bad parts of town (or a major city just north of me) waiting for that immaculate “come thru” text.  Tired of feeling like absolute dog shit half of the time and feeling great about 10% of the time. Tired of needing something to get through a 9-hour shift at whatever restaurant I’m cooking at (and barely keeping my job).  Tired of blowing through a $850 paycheck in four days and having literally NOTHING to eat in my house.  Tired of having to eat where I work just to survive the week.  I’m fucking exhausted, ya’ll.  After going back and forth between subs and boy, and now boy and kratom, I’ve finally found my way out.  Kratom really, really works for me, it knocks out 100% of my withdrawal symptoms and even provides a nice mood and energy lift.  Say what you want about trading one addiction for another, I don’t care.  The only thing I give a red fuck about is my paycheck and how I’m going to fix my car that I’ve neglected for years and currently won’t start.  I got my old job back at the bar/restaurant that’s a 12-minute walk from my house, things are looking up for a change.

I just wanted to say farewell to my favorite community on the entire Internet.  Ya’ll are SO supportive of each other; at times I’ve wanted to reach through my phone screen and hug you motherfuckers.  Please stay safe out there, the opiates memorial subreddit has way too many posts.

Much love to the lurkers, mods, shitposters, dope porn fiends, and to those of you that somehow can still come here even though you’re clean.  I’d like to become one of the latter, focusing on harm reduction if possible, but miraculously I never switched over to the needle.

It’s been a long (almost) decade.  I need to retire before I OD for the first time, which almost happened a few months ago.  Hopefully I can still come here and be a smartass and advise people about when it’s okay to take suboxone after their last shot, or give pointers on kratom.

Now if people are going to continue to use something that they know could be dangerous, they owe it to themselves to be as safe as possible. ODs happen because there are no stardizations in potency, and this is especially true today on the streets. However, risk can be minimized through my friends solutions and dilutions. 

There are right ways to dilute things and wrong ways. The reason so many people die is because of the latter. 

While, as a user, you don't have control over the intelligence of others, you can minimize your risk of OD drastically and systymatically.

Even if the fent cut is applied properly, it is best to always assume it could very well be deadly. That is to say you should assume every powder contains various hotspots and varying potencies.

Now know it or not, it's possible you could already be very familure with dilution processe(s). When people dissolve compounds(solute) in solution(solvent like water) this a dilution. Essentially you are making a more concentrated product into to something more uniform and diluted. This is where the safety, metaphorical, key lies.

Note: this assumes the fent or analogues are in the hydrocloride salt form. It's also important to note that this will not cause you to lose any product or have any negative effects. It is in you best interest.

The thing that people do wrong, when performing their personal dilutions, is that they are diluting with far too little solvent. Safe practices include: 

And btw, preferably you need a couple oral syringes (1ml, 5ml, 10ml) and some marked, sealed containers (like water bottles), but this can be done without precision, because it is a dilution. That's to say you can dilute the water by eye; doubling the water volume each time.

-In order to minimize the variation in dosing, all of your product needs to be applied to a large volume of solvent (water).
-I cannot give you exact amounts because each will have varying strength, in addition to tolerance 
-you could end up with a few very weak solutions, however nothing is lost, water can be evaporated off, and it's better than death.

1. Cover your solute (powder) completely with water (inside container). It is important that you are doing this to the entirety of your purchase. Now shake / wait until complelty disolved. If you don't have precise measuring tools, go with a larger volume over a smaller one. This first container is your ×1 potency baseline.

2. If you have the precision, measure the volume of liquid. (Oral syringes are very precise; the smaller the better, measuring cups are not very precise; but better than nothing). Take 1/4 the liquid out from the first container and add it to the second container. Add the same volume of liquid that was in the first container, to the 2nd container.

3. Repeat step 2 as needed. But step 3 should be within safety margins (tread carefully). If so e correctly this should be 1/16 the potency of the the first bottle. Now test your solutions with an oral syringe. Going by .1 ml incriments, and tolerating up your dose until you find the right active dosage for you as an individual. You can then convert your remaining solutions to the desired potencily.

Went a little overboard this month, and it's guaranteed I am going to run out of opiates about 10-12 days before my next refill...

I REFUSE TO BREAK THE LAW, and I am going to enter WDs in a few days, what steps can I legally take to avoid the WDs? I honestly could care less if I get high, I just need to avoid the WDs until the beginning of May so I can work each day. What are my legally-viable options for completely avoiding the WDs?

- Urgent care? Obviously urgent care wont give me more opiates, nor should urgent care give me more opiates. Would there be any reason to visit an urgent care?

- Emergency room? Several months ago a nurse at my pain clinic told me if I ever lose my opiates while traveling, I should visit the ER. I never did ask the nurse why I would visit the ER first, but that was the recommendation of a nurse at my pain clinic. If I visit an ER while in the middle of WDs what can I expect from the typical ER? What would an ER even do for me? Once again, I am not looking for more opiates. I dont want to get high. I just need to avoid the WDs until the beginning of May so I can work each day.

Contact my pain clinic? If so, what do I tell them? ""Oh by the way, I took more of my meds than I am suppose to, and ran out of my meds too quickly, can you help me with the WDs?"" Such a statement to my pain clinic sounds like a horrible idea. So, if I contacted my pain clinic, what should I tell them? I've been going to the same pain clinic for a couple of years, and I've never made a strange request from them before. I have a good relationship with my pain doctor.

What other suggestions do you have for someone to legally avoid WDs who is going to come up short by about 10 ten days before they get their meds legally filled again?

A few things to note:
- I have an ample supply of klonazapam, ativan and xanax available to me, although I have a high tolerance to all three.

- I have a large supply of lyrica.

Make no mistake though, I am going into WDs in a few days.  The above drugs may help around the edges, but I need to find a legally-viable way to completely avoid the WDs so I dont lose my damn job!  Any and all recommendations will be greatly appreciated.  :)",1524047235.0

Oh, and my 2 class C felony for CPCS (criminal possession of controlled substance) dropped down to Class A misdemeanors and has been put on ACD (adjournment in contemplation of dismissal) so what that means is it's all going to get dismissed in September if I don't get arrested until then. It was for my legal prescription from south korea, but the state troopers couldn't identify that it was mine cause they couldn't read korean and tell that it was a legal prescription, so they charged me with felonies and i had to spend time in jail after that through thanksgiving cause I needed the judge to be present to get bailed out and the bail was posted the day court was closed for thanksgiving. That's just an update since I remember posting about it a few months ago but back then it was still felony charges. How stupid.

So, that's that. I miss my wife a lot. It's been 10 hours since I saw my wife and I'm so devastated. But this is supposed to be an uphill battle, right?",1524043756.0

This is like when i was high and i would force myself to stay up to wait until i was less high to fall asleep. It feels exactly like that. 

I also have mad health anxiety, every little issue i have i find out what the worst csse scenario is. The last few months i have been thinking alot about mortality. I really am coming to grips with what i experienced and who i became while on drugs, i have had clean time before but it never felt like this. It would take a very drastic thing to make me go back to use. I mean, i think about it, i play with the thought, sometimes i get a taste of that desire that used to drive me to use drugs, but it seems gone. Even my serious pain issues, i seem to be able to deal wih better without drugs. 

The upside to the increased anxiousness is i know how to cope with it, and alot of times i just accept this is mostly how life will probably be for awhile.  I cannot stop thinking of death and dying, though. I cant and havent looked at my face in the mirror in a long time. The main thing i think of when im observig people is that one day they and i wont be around like we are anymore. I am obsessed with diseases and cancer, i dont know whats worse, blinding yourself willingly to degeneration, or accepting it and enveloping yourself with it. If someone offered me a bag of dope i would probably take it, but if you offered me 20 dollars or a equivalent dope tokens, id take the money and buy groceries with it, honestly.

This compound was sold under the name of 2-Me-MAF; a close relative of another potent fentanyl analogue which had recently been banned in China, known as methoxyacetylfentanil or MAF. At first the users reported it to be similar to MAF in potency and euphoria, just another of many delicious analogues available to opioid RC enthusiasts. Ten thousand strong doses for less than a hundred dollars.  

A couple more months passed and suddenly there were reports of the new batches of 2-Me-MAF being unlike those previous. Some wouldn't dissolve in water. Some had no effect at all. Many users reported their product did have an effect: a horrific and stimulating psychedelic trip, probably courtesy of kappa receptor agonism. Our beloved mu-opioid receptor mediates euphoria and gives us reason to throw our lives away for heroin, while its sister the kappa-opioid receptor mediates dysphoria. One user had their order of 2-Me-MAF sent off a toxicology lab to be quantified; the result confirmed the sole presence of 2-methyl-methoxyacetylfentanil.  Perhaps the euphoric batches of 2-Me-MAF had in fact been old MAF stock, too valuable to just be thrown away when the government prohibited its manufacture. Who knows.  

Onwards to my question: it's old news that fentanyl analogues can be purchased through Chinese wholesalers. Low-level dealers are aware of this, and I assume 2-Me-MAF has already made its way to the street as an aduterant in heroin, terrorizing everyone it meets.  

Yet I haven't seen any reports on unpleasant psychedelic heroin, so I'm asking here: does anyone know what I'm talking about? Have you taken heroin tainted with this chemical, or heard from somebody who has?",1524037654.0

When I was using heroin I really only used with one person. Me and him were best friends. We hung out, we played games, we smoked weed, and we really just did the kind of dumb shit you'd expect two young dudes to do.
I discovered pain pills, and soon after I was shooting smack. He was curious, so I allowed him to try it. At this point we're doing what we've always done, just taking a lot of breaks to inject a lot of drugs. We even went to college together. Two weeks into college though, I overdosed and almost died, when he found me and did CPR and helped my breathing while he called the paramedics. 
Now we are both (mostly) sober. We still smoke weed and drink occasionally, and we both hang out and drink Kratom sometimes, but my family is NOT comfortable with me being near him. They fear that I will relapse and die. 
I feel like I owe him the respect to not just abandon him. He is my best friend, after all. Is my family right? Would it be healthy to just drop him and stop speaking to him at all?

I meet my girl at the subway transfer from the n to the 7  to pick up money. I had Venmod her money so she could take it out of the bank for Me, long ago my accounts had been charged off after I Over drew them into oblivion.  She wanted to know what it was for...she doesn’t know I use heroin and I came up with a corny excuse I think she bought it but I didn’t care at that moment if she did or didn’t. She didn’t kiss me goodbye when we went our separate ways...I knew she was mad and I don’t blame her. But I can’t even begin to deal with that now...I have one thing on my mind...getting on that 7 train. 

I was lucky enough to catch an express...2 stops instead of 8. I still had a 20 minute walk after I got off and that’s walking at a normal pace which I was not...It was an 8 minute ride from start to finish it felt like a decade but finally my train dropped me off at my desired location. I was so close but still so far away.  A one mile walk sick  I would never make it. My legs were cramping my nose was dripping and I was sweating but freezing all at once.

I begrudgingly walked down the steps of the platform to the street below. Taxis lined the street waiting for a customer. I counted my money and decided fuck it I’m taking a taxi. 35 minutes turned into 4 and all of a sudden sweet relief was walking its way towards me with a grin on its face. My cabby was waiting around the corner for me.  I knew I could walk it back, once I was well it wouldn’t be the slightest issue but it was still cold out and I just wanted to get back to my 7 train. 

Just like that I was walking back to the cab rolling the bundle between my fingers. I find it funny that until i get these little baggies up my nose I will not relinquish my grip on the bundle, it’s not to leave my hand until I start to open them. I hop back in the car and tell my cabby to take me back to the train. I lay my phone out and immediately start opening and pouring 4 bags out. I move them into 3-4 lines, grab the straw from my pocket never being more careful than I was at that moment not to spill my
Precious cargo laid out on the screen of my phone. Day in and day out bags poured out onto my phone waiting for me to put them up my nose.  

In an instant I feel 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 110, 200% better. as each second passes my body returns to normal. It’s actually kind of sad.  My cabby asks me if I just bought weed as I clean up my supplies in his back seat. I laugh and simply say “No, I wish man I wish.” If only it were as simple as weed. 

We make it back to the subway and I pay my partner in crime who  I volunteered without his knowledge. I thank him for the ride and exit the car.  Gone are the sweats and the muscle cramps and I’m not even cold any more as I have that amazing fire burning on the inside keeping me warm. Just as my other symptoms immediately subsided my appetite quickly returned and i decided to spend my last $2 on 2 shitty McDonald’s cheeseburgers... but alas the 7 train awaited me.  The climb up the stairs this time was effortless I could have taken them 2 at a time if I desired but I decided to walk like a normal person. There would Be no express train on the return trip. As it only runs express towards the city during the morning commute. This time it would be 10 stops back but for all I cared it could have been 100 stops. As the train pulls away I don’t focus on each and every stop like I did on the way here. Now I allow my self to become consumed in my phone and before you know it I’m back where I had met my girl an hour prior... as I boarded the N and headed towards my Final destination 5 stops to go, feeling so much better than I did on my way. i couldn’t help but look across the tracks imagining sick me coming back this way only an hour prior. The difference was astounding. And it Instantly disgusted me. My daily trips on the 7 train. Heading out sick and heading home happy.  I can’t get over that, and  it eats at me, atleast it does for now. Until tomorrow when I head out sick going from the N to the 7 to a taxi and back all over again.  I feel like this is my own personal  groundhogs day. And there seems to be no escape. Until tomorrow 7 train. Until tomorrow

Below you will see the fentanyl warning reports we have received in order from the most recent, to the oldest. All fentanyl warnings are flaired as such and archived, so you can search for them by [clicking here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/search?q=flair%3Afent+warning&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) Reddit's search is not that great and it does not list them chronologically either, so the list below is still the best.

Here are some things to remember about heroin/fentanyl dope mix:

* You can purchase fentanyl test strips at [this site for $10.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/) They detect the presence of even the smallest amount of fentanyl and they will detect a good number of the fentanyl analogues as well. Is your life worth $10? You can't get high again if you are dead!

* There is no way you can be sure the powder you have been given does not contain fentanyl without testing, and there is no simple, fool proof method for checking it yourself besides the [linked test strips.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)

* Just because it looks, smells, tastes, and is chunky like good clean heroin doesn't mean there is not fentanyl in it and that it's not deadly.

* Be aware of pills that you are buying as well, it is getting more and more common to see numerous imprints of pills that are being counterfeited with an unknown amount of fentanyl in them. There are some very good fakes going around out there that will fool even the most seasoned pill user.

* Just because there is not a warning in your area it does not mean there is not fentanyl tainted dope around. Be safe, start small, use with a friend, have Narcan on hand, and **do test shots!**

* Be safe, be smart, start small, use with a friend, have Narcan on hand, and **do test shots!**

For the past 3 almost 4 years now, I've been able to keep my habit well under control. I only do pills (oxy and tramadol) as heroin is a much more slippery slope. I'm only 20 and as of recently I am now basically the boss at my great paying job meaning I am in charge of guys almost double my age because no one works even close to as hard as I do. I had my first few experiences with PK's when I was a sophomore in highschool. One of the kids in our stoner friend group had some sort of muscular atrophy condition I believe it was so he was always had a ridiculous amount of pills he would hand out to us like candy. The first few times I tried hydro and oxy it was fun but nothing I would go out of my way to get. It wasn't until a few years later that I tried again that my love for opis really started. I used to be a huge stoner because it would work wonders for my anxiety and depression up until I had a full blown nightmare acid trip. Ever since, weed has been ruined and that was about 4 years ago now. I do use them everyday after work. It might sound dumb but I have a personal rule where I won't get high until 5:00 or later if I'm still at work. I never work while high. I redose once at 8:00 or 9:00 and will very rarely redose for a second time. I never go more than a few weeks at a time without taking a tolerance break so that I don't become too physically dependent. I don't enjoy any other drug at all really and I have no intention of stopping anytime soon. I don't see anything wrong with my drug use as it's not hurting anyone else, it doesn't get in the way of my responsibilities. Addiction and health issues aside, I see my drug use no different than someone who get's stoned or has a few drinks every night. The concept is the same. ",1524009452.0

So I am a trained phlebotomist which if you don’t know is somebody that taps veins and draws blood all day long. Below is a list of tips you should ALWAYS follow when shooting to preserve your veins, heart, and avoiding infection. 


CLEANLINESS/ STAYING STERILE:

Before beginning your session, always make sure that your hands are WASHED CLEAN and that the area that you will be having your substances and rigs is clean as well. 
Please I cannot stress this enough, use a brand new needle every time. Do not ever share needles with anybody else as well.  You can purchase them on Amazon as I’ve been told and other places ESPECIALLY veterinarian websites online in bulk for cheap. Some states actually allow you to purchase them for insulin without a prescription. There’s no reason you should be using dull needles.
Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab, rub the swab in a circular motion for 15 seconds. It should be 70% alcohol or higher.

MICRON FILTERS MICRON FILTERS MICRON FILTERS They are very cheap online and they are lifesavers. No excuse to not have them! They will SAVE your limbs and we all like those don’t we? 
THESE ARE ESSENTIAL!!!


 NEEDLES:

Use a new needle every single time if you can as the sharper the needle, the less tissue damage but if you absolutely cannot, then use it only up to 4 to 5 times tops if your budget is tight. This is because the duller the needle gets, the more damage and scarring it will cause to your veins that is irreparable and nobody WANTS track marks. This is KEY to keeping your skin and veins in as good as a condition as you can while shooting. You wouldn’t even know I shot by the looks of my arms. 

If you do reuse a needle rinse it and sterilize it if possible you can boil them in hot water on the stove. If you cannot boil it, make sure you thoroughly rinse it and store it with the cap on in a sterile place. Bleach is just as effective if not more!! May even be as easier option to you depending on your circumstance. 

Use the smallest gauge needle that you possibly can. This will obviously cause the least amount of damage and frankly pain.

And obviously before administration, make sure all air bubbles are removed my tapping the side of the syringe and pushing the remaining air out with the plunger.

FINDING A VEIN:

Stay away from veins in your feet, 

Constantly rotate the sites that you use. It is not smart to keep going up or down a vein a half an inch and shooting multiple times in that area. You should let it rest and use a different spot.

Try to use your ante cubital which is the center vein in the ditch of your arm. If not, use any vein that is large and easily accessible. 

Veins feel like a garden hose. They should be a little bouncy to the touch. You should palpate for a vein with just one finger. Once you have found a good one it’s time to get blood flowing into that arm so you can tourniquet it. 

When tourniquetting, the rule of thumb is *4-6 inches* above the injection site. Make it so that you can remove the tourniquet while injecting. I do this by having the end of it in my mouth or having a belt wrapped around under my thigh and up and over my arm and doing it that way. This is important so that you can relieve pressure before you take the needle out. 

Make sure the bevel of the needle which is the pointed opening is FACING UPWARDS!!
This is proper practice and less damaging to veins. 
In other words when you are putting the needle into your skin, you should be able to see the opening of the needle. It should be facing the sky so that the most pointed part of the needle is inserted first.

If you think you are in a vein and did not register, DO NOT DIG AROUND!!
 Pull the needle completely out, get the air out, and attempt again. I CANNOT stress this enough!! This causes major scarring and damage to your veins and it is called raking. NO GOOD. 
Think of it as taking a knife and cutting up your veins. Don’t do it because you think it will be quicker. Eventually you won’t be able to use that site because of practices like this.

If you are using veins on your forearm that tend to roll you can use your tourniquet above the site as well as one below to keep the vein from rolling or if you have a friend, they may apply pressure to the other side as well with two fingers. 

Drinking water will help keep your veins open and more easily accessible so make sure to drink water and keep hydrated always. This is honestly a huge huge tip especially for people with smaller veins and people that don’t drink enough water. Even after one day you will see a difference. 



SHOOTING:

Once you have registered, pull back slowly (this is important) and inject an amount, register again and pull the plunger back to make sure you are STILL in the vein and finish the injection. This is also a ridiculously important part. You will be able to feel if you are not in the vein. It will have a slight resistance to the injection and tends to burn or hurt. You are highly unlikely to get an abscess if you register a couple times ensuring that you are in the vein as well as following the cleanliness steps. 

As you are pushing the plunger in for the last injection, you should be removing the tourniquet at this point. You MUST leave the needle in before you take the tourniquet off so that pressure is not shooting towards the injection site. This WILL cause bruising and hematomas. 

AFTER THE SHOT:

Once you have removed the tourniquet, slowly remove the needle and have a paper towel or tissue ready to place MODERATE pressure on the site for a least a minute. This will prevent brusing. 

** A COMMON MISCONCEPTION **
DO NOT BEND YOUR ARM IF YOU INJECTED IN THE DITCH RIGHT AFTER. HOLD YOUR ARM STRAIGHT UP WITH APPLIED PRESSURE.
Bending your arm actually opens up the small puncture you made in the vein more as the vein moves. 

Put on a bandaid with a fresh piece of rolled up paper towel under it so it applies pressure for an hour or so and enjoy your high! 

If you experience any bruising after despite these tips and steps you can use an Arnica cream that will overtime reduce the bruises quicker than normal although you shouldn’t have so much as a red dot if you followed these steps! 

SORRY FOR THE LENGTH! But this stuff is all so important guys. You literally cannot even tell I shoot up because of these practices. Enjoy guys! And PLEASE me know if you have any questions. I am more than happy to help you guys out with being safe. Message me anytime.

This system used to work really well back when the vast majority of heroin was.....HEROIN! and not the other way around, as we can only have 2 things 'stickied' at once and we might have 3-4 warnings in one day.

There will now just be one post stickied to the top of the sub titled 'Fentanyl warnings and information' or something similar to that. Inside this post there will be some information that is common sense to some, and valuable to others; like where to purchase fent test strips, signs of fentanyl dope, and other stuff like that. There will also be all of the fentanyl warnings that have been submitted to us listed from most recent and getting older.

**You guys will still submit the fentanyl warnings the same way that you have been** and we will continue to lock them, but they will be compiled, linked to, and organized inside this one post at the top of the sub. There will also be some additional features added like searchable flair and some other little things.

For the first couple times, I got hooked up straight, I guess now that was to lure me in.  I never had to wait, I never got slacked and the shit was always fire.

Within a week the bags were getting slacker, the dope shittier and I'd have to wait upwards of three hours just to score a shit, slack point of bap.

To top it off, this motherfucker wouldn't answer the phone half the time.  I ended up having to buy overpriced blues in the interim and texted him telling him that he had lost a $300 play.

He texted me back with ""money doesn't make me move"".

I broke off all contact with him after that and continued to buy overpriced blues until I got a solid connection that is ALWAYS fat and I come to them, not the other way around.  No waiting or any bullshit.

Used to wake up and when I took my first pills, felt amazing, how most of you feel. Last year found out about kratom. Started a bad habit of taking more oxy some days and supplementing with kratom on low days.

Somehow, early this year, after 4 years of taking opiates, the euphoria went away. Like tolerant 24/7 even though I have that microwithdrawal in the morning before dosing

Often when I get my new batch of oxy I set aside hard work ""treat"" days where I take like up to 50-80mg and borrow from other days (where I just do kratom and 10mg). 2014-2017 those days I'd be drooling in love with myself. Now, when I tried that past couple months, just felt no different than 30mg, but tired, very itchy, bad eyesight. Extra side effects, no bliss. I get a legal perscription 30mg for nerve pain,in my late 20's now so maybe age plays a role.

I got into potentiators from here when I was running low and got desperate to make every bit count. Grapefruit juice, tonic water and DXM at the end of high dosing days, because it's supposed to reset tolerance. 

Maybe it was that, maybe it was sometimes taking kratom on the same day as normal oxy dose, in the afternoon, when in the past only took oxy between 9am-2pm, and toughing through the afternoon crash

Maybe if I figure out what I did wrong, I'll learn something valuable about tolerance and getting the most of your opiates, something I can teach others to avoid so they don't have this happen.",1523996398.0

I just shot up a little while ago, after picking up my 2 month keytag.

I'm finding the same issues I had previously with NA still following me around. Basically, I don't like the culty-ness of it. I do like the comradery, the peer-to-peer support, I think that works amazingly well.


I can't even bring this up to my NA group or sponser because I get the canned response of ""well you're obviously not ready"" or ""you're not trying"" etc. I don't like how they will litterally harp and yell at a newbie if they use the wrong nonmenclature, etc.

edit: of course I'm not ready to get 100% clean, no addict is. See that's the problem, it's an all or nothing kind of thing. There's no middle ground I can shoot for and work my way up.



I don't like the ""obsessing about being clean"" aspect of it. I don't want drugs (or not using drugs) to be the main focus of my life.


I want to be able to use on the occasions I want to, and have the will power to say no when I know I'm encroaching physical addiction.

Basically, getting clean got me to a point where I could finally go to Central America and visit family.  I went, and was offered all the cocaine of  Central America for essentially peanuts.


So I bought the cocaine from some 12 year olds, and tooted my week away. I guess when I came back I wanted to do more of it, but cocaine is so expensive in the states and crap compared to the crap I was buying off the children.


Getting sober is a nice (lofty) goal, and I'd like to attain total sobreity, but not at the cost of my sanity.  IMO, living a life these NA hardcore people live, where it's constantly ""meetings this, sponser that, meeting, meeting...etc"", that's not what I want.


I guess what I'm saying is IDK what to do. should I continue on the NA path? or just give it up entirely? Or somewhere in between?

Non hateful opinions are welcome!

As are hateful ones, just remember you're being mean to someone who loves you.


and I *really* love you.


I don't feel like I failed, I feel like I hiccuped, and need some direction. Is there any way to balance this? Being a junky is no good, but being a NA-addict, is equally as bad imo.",1523980713.0

Also, what are your methods for getting your powder the finest?","Haven’t seen a post like this in a while. Everything is drug porn, candy porn, newb questions, etc. All are fine of course but wanted to change it up a bit. 

My ritual is that I have a box I keep everything in that has a nice smooth side. It’s from a pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones and has perfect little compartments inside. I keep everything inside and take out what I need. 

My ROA, contrary to my user name, is to sniff everything. It’s something I started a long time ago and I think I’m more addicted to sniffing sometimes than the drug itself (not!). 

My DOC, which are oxy 30’s (A215 baby) come out, usually 2-3 depending on if first dose or not. I also take out my card, my straw, lighter and my clean (as it can be) dollar bill. 

Turn box over on my lap, so smooth side is on top and put dollar bill on top of pills. Put lighter sideways at first to make the initial crush. Once somewhat crushed I then turn lighter vertical and run everything over with the bottom of the lighter. I feel I get a better connection with the top of the box in order to crush everything finer. 

Once I get it as fine as I can I then scrape the dollar bill off as much as possible.  I know I shouldn’t because money is gross but to make sure nothing goes to waste I wipe the dollar and lick my fingers, then use wet fingers to clean rest of powder off dollar. 

Then use the card to chop away. 

This is where my second question comes in. I feel I can only get the powder so fine, and knowing that the finer the powder, whether it’s pill powder or H powder, I am curious what other methods people use to get the finest of powder. 

Next I line everything up and use the straw to take me to euphoria. I sniff as light as possible so that the powder coats my inner nostrils and does not go to my throat. A drip is inevitable but try to lessen as much as possible. (Btw, I love the way an oxy drip tastes)

I usually do this in my car which is parked in my apartments underground garage, so I feel safest there. I made a post the other day about how I go about doing it at work; which is a whole other ritual in itself. 

So, opi fam, if you’re bored and want to contribute, what is your ritual?? Because let’s face it, it’s all we have to keep us sane...",1523965761.0

Chris believes a percentage of life juice saved from the dying is given to their savior. He first uncovered that truth when he was a senior in high school, he pulled his friend off the road before a truck sped by. His meth addiction is only secondary to his addiction to saving lives. Chris has absorbed enough life juice that he's beyond human, and by all intents and purposes, a god. Or so he says.

I have been a consistent user of oral synthetic opiate painkillers for several years and have developed a pretty massive tolerance. Obviously my standard dose has increased steadily  all while using the same medication and suddenly in the last three weeks or so something really weird has happened.  (and just to clarify yes I have confirmed the meds I have are the same, legit script I've been using, I'm not suddenly taking some fake pills with fent in them or something). 

But suddenly the dose I have been consistently taking, one which I very gradually built up to and have very established, consistent reaction to, was too heavy for me to the point of pretty significantly needing to reduce my dose and now literally only over the course of less than a couple weeks I've had to reduce my dose to what it was almost like a year and a half / two years ago, and it's still feels like it's maybe a bit much. 

Basically it's like I've experienced a sudden and inexplicable tolerance drop without having reduced my dose or frequency of dosing. Has anyone experienced this? Is it possible that there's some kind of latent medication built up in my system over the years that is multiplying my normal dose to be more potent?

I know to some people this must sound like the dream, a sudden tolerance loss without having to take a break but it's also kind of bizarre and frightening as I want to be careful and safe as well (as much as one can be). 

Any similar experiences or insight much appreciated.

I know about that, but I wanted ask how likely is it really, if one was to try some 10mg oxycodone IR, to get addicted.. I am just curious, because every time someone posts about wanting to try oxy, so many people advise against it in a way that reminds me of the horror stories of DARE campaign.. as I said, I understand opiates are a very slippery slope, I just wanted to ask if I'm missing something? 

Thousands of people are given oxy's every year for acute short term pain, yet they don't become addicts.. how much more addicting is this stuff really, compare to say 100mg of tramadol or 150mg of codeine (10mg oxy I mean, as they should not be drastically different in terms of strength..)?? if one is in a good mental state (no trauma, depression, anxiety), is this stuff as addictive as it appears form the comments deterring people from trying it even once?? 

I understand that every addiction started with that first dose and it's always better to deter people in case they would like it too much, instead of glorifying it. But I wonder if the way people respond to first time use questions is not too over the top?? Did your view on life drastically change after the very first dose?? Could you not stop thinking about the feeling for a very long time, until you went for more?? 

I'm just trying to understand, as I have had codeine and tramadol (as well as lot of other non-opiate drugs) and while they were pleasurable and I always felt like having some more for 1-2 days after, that feeling always subsided... Is oxy really that different from both weaker opiates (codeine, tramadol) as well as other dopaminergic drugs (coke, dexies, ritalin, aderall)??

I'm just asking cause this is such a lovely community of supportive people and it kinda struck me how strongly you are trying to deter others from trying from trying opiates in a way that almost seems too over the top (DARE type propaganda).. I'm not saying that you are overstating the risks, that's basically what I'm asking about.. Would you say the replies are 100% accurate (trying it once poses a major risk), or are they perhaps influenced by you guys seeing opiates taking so much away from you and your loved ones (and therefore a bit overstated, due to emotional involvement)??

Sorry for the long set of questions, just wanted to clarify, hear some stories and maybe get a discussion going..

**Via Cliff**
Buy dope on pay day through Cliff, inevitably loan $100-$150 so he can have dope. Thus effectively halving that which is available for my immediate consumption while spending double. Sure, I'll eventually get it back. One time surprisingly mostly in cash but often in pill form which cannot be spent on bills, Amazon or in most retail stores. For returning readers, I need not list the times in which Cliff engaged in shady shenanigans but for the unfamiliar search for posts with the flair ""Cliffpost, and ""Cliff Post!"". Entering the search query as *flair:Cliffpost* and *flair:Cliff Post* in the right side search bar for this subreddit seems to find all of the flared Cliffposts.

&nbsp;

**Via Tim**
Buy through my long time friend Tim. Not an option anymore. After the second time I bought through him, he went to a local hospital that had sort of ""three day detox"" program followed by being inducted into a Suboxone program. I don't know if he fell off the wagon since last week, I hope he is still clean. In his words, ""I spent over forty grand in the past two years."" He told his wife that he went into the program for ""opiates"" because he'd be on the street if his wife knew he was on heroin. I spoke to him briefly today and he said he'll contact me in a couple of days as he has a busy night and day of work ahead of him. I only bought dope through Tim on two occasions but both times everything went smoothly. He took whatever I offered as a middling fee without complaint and even offered subsequent fair trades without making me feel pressured to trade. For example, ""would you like to trade some of your bags for this many subs?"" He was also cool because he fronted the dope for me and based on my good word.

&nbsp;

**Via Derrick**

Derrick is Cliff's primary middle and Cliff often tells stories about him pulling shady shit. I suspect about 50% of the stories are made up shit, some of them are projections of Cliff on fictitious personification of Derrick. Other times Cliff makes up stories about Derrick in order to explain why the current order is a little short. When Cliff first started getting dope, Derrick would give him bags (10 bags to a bun) that were taped shut. Derrick claimed the dealer did this to ensure that any middle wouldn't tamper with them. When Cliff met Derrick's dealer, the guy said he did not put tape on the bags. It turned out that Derrick was taking shit out of the bags then taping them shut to make it appear like he couldn't have.



After Tim went on the wagon, I decided to bypass Cliff and buy directly from Derrick. First order was three buns, I gave Derrick half a bun for middling. I figured if I was generous he would be less likely to scheme. For that and the subsequent order Derrick did state he didn't care about the middling fee, that he was just doing me the favor. Of course I knew he wouldn't middle out of the kindness of his heart. Well, that first order, instead of ten bags to a bun as Cliff normally gets, it was four fatter bags. Since I was to receive 2.5 buns, the first bag represented one full bun. The remaining three were supposedly half a bun each. Derrick emptied one out to show me how it broke up into a number of lines. Then upon departure he said ""check it out, let me know what you think.. if any of the bags appear too small, let me know and I'll tell the dealer so he can include an extra bag on the next order."" Pretty sketchy to me. I have no idea without a scale or a reference that I'm accustomed to such as the buns that are divided into ten bags. In Derrick's words, it was quicker to have the dope ready in this form. The reason Cliff always gets ten bag buns is because ""he's mad stingy.""


&nbsp;

**In Conclusion**

Doing business and getting dope through Cliff is risky and generally sucks. As a fellow opi redditor once said, ""Cliff makes doing dope unfun."" Dealing with Tim was sunshine and roses but it ended too soon and I really can't complain for the sake of his family life and well being. Derrick is shady AF. Nice enough guy, hasn't had an opportunity to screw me over and put me through tribulations like Cliff has. Hell, he gets blamed for some of the shit Cliff has done when it was totally Cliff. Nonetheless, It's not viable to do business with Derrick in lieu of Cliff with the expectation that I'll get a fair shake. With my current options I will not get a fair shake. Thus, I'm better of sticking with subs and keeping my money.

Now about that writer's conundrum. I've been writing a Cliffpost. Wrote it three times, three different ways but it keeps coming out long. My last attempt has good grammar and makes sense to read for the most part but it's just very long and I don't want to post a wall of text even if I keep the paragraphs neat separate. I'm tempted to seek an editor but I don't want to waste someone elses time. 


On another note, someone said ""if only you put such effort elsewhere, you could succeed at anything."" So before I wrote the most recent Cliffpost draft for the third time I spent over two hours working on a book. I always considered writing a book, well two types of books.. One educational and another fictional. I'm glad I spent time on that, I don't actually know how books are written and how people make some books so damn thick but with self publishing being a thing, it's a worth a shot to engage in such an undertaking.

Instead of getting high from benzos they just knocked me the fuck out eventhough I already lowered the dose a little. Had a great nights sleep though.

Then I drank some booze to get rid of the morning shakes, while I was taking a shit I did a shot of heroin. After I was done shitting I played a game ( more like making sure I didn't log out in a shit location the night before..

-crushing the dope (I get rocks a lot) into the FINEST powder I can get it.

-separating the lines so that each one is very narrow and small. I heard this helps it absorb better in the mucous membrane. Fat lines are tempting but it gets me higher to break a fat line into many smaller lines.

-barely snorting (so that it doesn’t go down the throat and cause oral ingestion and a drip). I almost always make sure now when I sniff the dope that I’m not doing it hard enough to make a loud noise with my nose.

-straw farther up the nose.

-I was told to try and putting a few drops of water in each nostril beforehand. This seems to work really well.

Currently, she is taking half of a 10/300 before she goes to bed. If the pain becomes too bad, she will take a second half of the tablet. She is only taking half a tablet because taking a full tablet makes her feel to groggy and spaced out the next morning. (She is a college professor, she needs to be ""on"" by the time she gets to her first class.) 

She also mentioned that the vicodin doesn't seem to be touching the pain. I have urged her to ask the doctor about the possibility of a stronger painkiller such as percocet, but she is hesitant about doing so because she figures that it will make her even more groggy the next morning. 

I figured that this would be a good place to ask for advice. I have two questions: First, in your experience, is percocet likely to be a more effective painkiller than vicodin? Second, do you find that percocet makes you groggier in the morning? 

I realize that everyone experiences these drugs in different ways, but it would be nice to have some more data points.

I subtly think my pharmacist may be a user. Maybe switching out legit stuff and keeping them? I don’t know. I’ve been short a pill or two at times, but never bitch cause he has never given me shit for filling a day or two early. These say on the bottle that they are Purdue. But they crumble apart with scissors.

This is a legit script, I just want them instant so I use the coke trick. Cut them up as small as possible. USUALLY they are a fucking pain, hard and gummy at the same time. But these break into tiny pieces. I can post pictures, but figured I’d start here

But these crumble. Like 2 cuts and they are broken up. I put a small piece in my mouth, and it gelled up but barely.

My fear is I take like 160mg at a time. If these weren’t legit, that would be bad.

Do I need to be worried,? Because I am. Should I shoot him with the narcam I have, if I do he will get so pissed and maybe beat me up. If he needs an ambulance I would have to figure how to get someone 100+pounds on me whose paraniod from Coke to a car that is three small flights of stairs away plus I have a fake leg that I probably shouldn't add 200+ pounds too. Because I can't call an ambulance to my house especially for him especially for this reason. So I would need to know what to do quickly. 

Also something peculiarly odd is his pain tolerance is very low. I accidentally stepped on his foot. I had shoes he didn't. I didn't stomp or grind it or anything just accidentally stepped on it and now he is in excruciating pain. Keeps groaning and going oh my God grabbing his leg just acting like someone is driving a nail through it and it seems as though that shouldn't cause that much pain.

How do you make yourself feel like you’re worth something again?","I’m sorry if this isn’t really allowed. I just don’t know what to do, and this community always seems so tight knit and supportive. 

I’m at the end of my rope. I’ve been a failure all my life, I live in the middle of no where, I have no license so getting a job is nearly impossible. I have no friends in my area, and the one light of my life, my boyfriend, is hundreds of miles away in the US, completely out of my reach. I haven’t seen him in months and it kills me. I don’t feel like I’ll ever see him again, especially my if I continue to be a failure at finding a job. He’s already paid for one plane ticket for me to visit him, I’m not going to ask him to waste his money on me like that again when I can never give him anything proper in return. 

In my depression I’ve turned hella suicidal and spend any moment I can trying to get high off whatever I can find. I’ve been mysteriously sick for years and throw up multiple times every day, I can barely keep any food down, I get malnourished and dehydrated regularly, and unless I have something for my nausea like weed, I just end up throwing up my food hours later. Doctors are incredibly dismissive of me. They all chock it up to anxiety or a pregnancy that simply cannot and does not exist, none ever want to run any real tests. 

I recently got kicked out of my apartment by my incredibly abusive roommates, they had me walking on eggshells 24/7, it destroyed me mentally. When I left I wasn’t able to take my bed home with me, so for months I’ve been stuck on a thin futon mattress that heats up like a furnace underneath me as I sleep, and I wake up every few hours drenched in sweat but freezing cold from the air of the basement. 

Every moment is miserable. I don’t know what to do anymore. If I wasn’t such a coward I’d kill myself, I probably just should. I’ve never done anything of worth in my entire life, the only good to happen to me was posting a single comment in a fan fiction forum that introduced me to my boyfriend and best friend for the better part of a decade, but I don’t think I’ll ever see him again. I know I cause him pain, too. He knows I’m sick and in pain and depressed to the point where he doesn’t know if I’ll be alive when he wakes up, and it causes him so much pain. He can’t sleep, he gets anxiety attacks and even his family’s noticed he’s been off kilter. I just drag everyone around me down. 

Is there any way to get out of a hole like this? Or am I really as fucked as I feel like I am. I just don’t know. Delete this if it’s too much of an off-topic rant, I don’t even know why I bothered typing this whole thing up. Guess I just needed to straighten out my thoughts. Some successful stories of people salvaging the shreds of their lives might help my outlook right now, if anyone has an uplifting tales...

Its been a little over a month-ish. (Dont know exactly when I stopped and i hate counting days).

This past week or so has been pretty brutal as far as cravings and anxiety go. It had been beating me down pretty hard and i was starting to begin the process of rationalizing a relapse. 

Tonight I said fuck it and ended up driving to a head shop to see if they sold kratom. I knew the chances of it being any good were slim and already held pessimistic views on its ability to be of any use in preventing a relapse despite all of the testimony to the contrary. But i was gonna give it a shot. So i bought a  bottle of bali capsules. And holy shit did they blow my mind. It was pretty subtle at first but after a while i began to feel like i had popped a couple vicodin. I only had to take 3gs too which was another surprise. I figured after a years long heavy habit such as mine, Id have to take at least 5gs to get any effect.

So definitely will be looking into vendors and buying more. The stuff i got from the head shop...i know its good but fuck its expensive. 15 bucks for 17 grams. Was mostly to find out if it would work and that it did. 

TLDR: skeptic decided to give kratom a shot before relapsing and was overwhelmingly satisfied. ",1523859402.0

I ended up grabbing just one bag off a cold cop spot while waiting for my main dude to be ready in a few hours (It was 6am). I shot the bag and awake hours later to somebody knocking on my window telling me I need to get the fuck out there and get rid of the shit on my lap (rigs, ect) I then went and met up with my regular guy and decided I'd wait until I got back to college to use again so that wouldn't happen.

Thanks to the advice and encouragement of you beautiful people, I got a new plug!

I woke up this morning sick as fuck. None of my people were answering my texts, and they / been since Friday.. so I decided today was the day. Im cutting out the middle man. 
LI drove across town to the plugs house. I was nervous.. what if he didn't remember me.. what if he thinks I'm the cops.. what if he thinks I'm trying to rob him and he shoots me through the door. Between being sick and the numerous ways this could go wrong, my anxiety was through the roof.

I knock... No answer... This is a terrible idea..

I knock again... Still no answer.. he's not going to go for this... Or maybe he didn't hear me.....

I ring the door bell.... His girl opens the door, and walks away.. ""lock that door behind you."" 

I'm in!

I go in and he's sitting on his bed.. scale and bag read and waiting. I explain to him that I was supposed to be meeting the middle, but he's bullshitting, so I figured I'd knock and just go straight to him. And I'll be damned.. ""Cool. Whatcha need?"" 

I left with a gram and his phone number.

An hour later the middle is calling and texting me, threating to kill me and calling me several unimaginative bad words. He says the plug won't fuck with  me anymore. But money talks.. we'll see what he says when I come by and buy my weekly ball. I can't imagine he'll turn that down.

So thank you friends! It worked! I'm plugged in!! X

Ill try making this short. A while ago I (like an idiot) agreed to do this swab test/DNA test to basically get results that would determine based upon my genes, what medications work and don't work.......SUPPOSEDLY) At the time I agreed, I was/still am really depressed all the time. So my thinking at the time was hopefully I can just get the right medication the first time around, as to rather than testing several and seeing which is best) - ***(Worst mistake was taking that swab test***)

FAST FORWARD TO NOW:
I recently seen a spine specialist whom seemed okay at first. (Im 28 and have 2 protruding disc and a narrow spinal canal, on top of that my SI and L5 **(S1 is the Sacrum and the L5 is the lowest vertebrae in our spine)** is sacralized **(fused bones together)**  - Congenital, was probable cause.

So this Dr, he ended up having me do an updated MRI (which sucks fucking assss I hate that machine) and we ended up also getting some new X-Rays on my lumbar. Before any meds, he made me do an epidural in my spine and yes I was asleep! LOL i was not ready for that. Few days later i told him it made it worse (truth), and so long story short he prescribed me x120 10mg Oxy-Hcl because I told him Ive had flare ups in the past and that was my typical prescription from the past- which was completely true.

Week or so later I get the results and went over it with the Psychiatrist - Turns out it says in some for or another for pain pills and medications I has been using for years now, including benzodiazepines, list them as ""Serum level may be decreased, an increased dose would be required) - **In other words theyre saying dont prescribe them this.** BUT anything in the ""stimulant section"" all had green marks, WHICH PISSED ME OFF, I WAS LIKE WOW WORLD I DONT DO STIMS AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DO TO ME?! (Sarcastically yelling lol)

I go in for my follow up appt with my spine doc and what not, and by then he got the test results of course. We do a few routine things and when we get to medications he says he wont prescribe me the same script, BUT he said he'd be willing to give me the same dose in HYDROCODONE (GENERIC OF COURSE). I tried to keep my cool because it made completely no sense. 

His excuse was ""well hydro usually last a bit longer in your system than oxy does"" and I say back something on the llines of ""whats the point of it lasting longer if it's a less efficient pain med and I would end up having to suffice by taking more since it would be less effective"" 

He wouldnt budge, I tried telling him in some form or another that he's incorrect by switching me to hydros but he didn't budge at all. I explicitly told him that I did NOT want OXY as my long term pain management, JUST ONLY for this new disc that is pushing against my nerve canal and is causing sciatica pain and overall discomfort.

I said fuck it, trying to not argue with him so I wouldn't portray addict-like behavior and got the script upstairs at their pharmacy. OBVIOUSLY AS EXPECTED IT WAS SHIT good for pain which caused me to use more way more. (AND I TOLD HIM THIS WOULD HAPPEN SINCE THEY'RE LESS EFFECTIVE......!) I got the Mallincrodt M367 10/325.

I ended up calling him a few weeks later and told him my rant and how they're not effective and its causing problems at work and so on. He said if they werent working than my other options ""per my results"" said I can do either surgery or fentenyl. I couldn't believe he was going to offer me fent, but not oxy... even worse suggesting me to do back surgery. Ive seen so many specialist over the years and they ALL said to NOT do surgery unless i absolutely needed to because of my young age. We argued and went back and fourth so much I had to hang up on him before I snapped on him.

* I'm scheduled for a second opinion Wednesday morning, and since I've scheduled it I'm getting nervous she'll tell me the same thing since the last doctor I seen was the head off the pain management section. I dont know how else to express to them that the oxycodone is so much better for my pain than hydrocodone is, without making it sound like you're a pill seeker. I even have like 30-20 Norcos left and its been way over a month now, that's how much they don't work.

**ANY ADVICE ON HOW TO APPROACH NEW DOC TO GET MY USUAL SCRIPT AGAIN??**

tl;dr - Getting second opinion for my back problems but the ""old"" doctor is the head of the pain mngnmt section. They want to give me hydros rather than oxy",1523838231.0

The other, a gorgeous, thicc black chick who digs my sense of humor, has started to unreliable, and only available at weird times. She has decent stuff for 60/g. But only if you catch her during her weird hours.

Today, hitting my spent foils to keep the vomit down, I found my old black book of numbers I didn't want to lose. Among the entries in that hallowed text, I found one that i remembered being good.

I make contact, place my order, and head to the spot. Dude is late, of course. But he is remorseful, legitimately. He threw in an extra dub and bought me taco bell cause he was late. If I wasn't sober and sick, I would've chalked it up to doap brain.

In short, got a new plug that is around 24/7 who is cool AF. Just jumped to the top of the list. Buying your first time custie taco bell will do that, plus throwing in that extra dub, which he insisted on showing me on the scale.

In some ways the act of being all stealthy in order to get high, particularly with IV usage almost kind of a rush in of itself? 

Just that you know you’re doing something “naughty”, and then getting away with it, and then the physical rush of the actual opiate upon injection. That psychological thrill I get when I have my dope & needle, got it all mixed up in a syringe that’s in a vein, followed by the (second, obviously) BEST part of the process, registering the needle by pulling back on the plunger. As soon as that lovely warm, red blood floods into the syringe I know all that’s left to connect the current psychological high to one of the most satisfactory physical feelings in the world is the simplest action ever, pushing the plunger down. 

I know a lot of people (especially when dopesick) say they wish they could and would if they could, take everything involving heroin or other opiates back. Sometimes when I’m sick too I might slightly agree, but I tend to brush that aside, sorta like how people say they “Will NEVER drink AGAIN!” while hungover as hell, but then inevitably do (usually).

What I've tried so far:

-Plastic drugstore pill crusher (screw round piece into dish). Doesn't work ... beads too small and hard.

-Mortar & pestle. Beads just squash into gummy flat things with no powder (that's if they don't go bouncing off into the abyss).

-After crushing, soaking with vit C and some heat etc. Doesn't dissolve. And when I do shoot the mix (filtered to clear) I get no high.

End up having to dump the mix in my mouth. They work fine orally even after trying to soak out the drug, which suggests that none of the drug is dissolving in the water mix.

I commented that while all healthcare should be accessible/affordable, its pretty uncaring/messed up to say that an addict’s life is somehow less valuable than someone with allergies. 

Now, I know better than to get too political or start fights on social media but I just had to pipe up and try keep this harmful mindset from spreading. The girl never commented back but I looked today and she took down the post! I wasn’t mean, just simply stated that we should fight for everyone to have access to the care they need and no one deserves to die due to a corrupt system. I really hope it made her reflect  a little about these things; and how what may seem like a witty meme can actually be harmful to how we try to view problems in our healthcare system.

So is this correct and is there anyway to scrap the pipe or anything to get a few extra hits when I’m out. Like with H you can wash your cotton, is there anything like that for this? Hey, thank for everyone that answers and is helpful!! You rock!

I am (was) a Registered Nurse. I got addicted to pain pills like 10 years ago after an injury. So, being a nurse, I had super easy access to pills. After a few years, I got caught writing scrpits for myself. Now that is some serious fucking shit. Being as I am a ""good person"" for being a ""nurse"" my employer and the police chose to give me a break. OK, great. Of corse, I was fired from my job, lost my house, my car, my Nursing license and my whole life went to shit. So, rather than killing myself, I got into recovery. I did all the meetings and blah blah blah, got on suboxone (which is another fucking nightmare) and I got through it. Slowly, over the YEARS, I got my shit back together.  I got my nursing license back, I got another RN job and worked and lived like a ""normal person"" for about a year. Seeing as I was doing so good in my life, I figured it would be a GREAT time to relapse. I figured this time, I would be smart enough NOT to get caught. I would be smarter about it this time. Rather than write scripts in my name, I decided to write scripts in someone elses name. It was easy to get the medications delivered to my work and I got away with it for about 6 months....until one day...I got caught again. SHOCKER. Like honestly what the FUCK is wrong with my brain? Again, I was fired, my employer called the police on me and the Department of Health suspended my nursing license. As I sat at the police station with the narcotics detective this time, I was being charged with Medicare Fraud, possession of a controlled substance, misappropriation of property and some other shit I do not even remember. I was like, OK, Ill go to jail. I did not even give a fuck at all about anything and honestly, I felt like I deserved it. I deserved to go to jail. I have never been there before but fuck, if I keep doing this stupid shit, jail might help me to stop. Again though, since I am a ""nurse"" and a supposed ""good person"" no charges were filed, I did not go to court, jail, or anything. I can get my nursing license back again, and I can work as a nurse again but it will take AT LEAST 2 years of monitoring by an MD, weekly urine tests, monthly progress reports about my recovery submitted to the Department of Health, weekly Nursing groups, a fuck load of dedication and not to mention the thousands upon thousands of dollars to pay for this. Is it even worth it anymore? I really do not know. On on hand, I want to be a nurse again because I LOVED my job. It defined me as a person. Without my job, I am really nothing. On the other hand, I really just want to take this opportunity to start using bigger and better things such as heroin. I know how fucking stupid this may sound but I figure, why not? I have already destroyed my life, my family left me, my friends are long gone, I have already lost everything that I cared about so why not just say fuck it? It just takes too fucking long to rebuild life after everything has been lost. I have already done it once, I just do not have the energy to do it again.",1523812283.0

#Living Dead

Like so many before,

And so many to come.

The rest of you,

May think were dumb.

A waste of space,

Of life,

Of air.

Some of us hurry,

But we'll all get there.

Destiny.

Choice.

Maybe just,

Hear my voice?

None of us scared,

Intimidated or dared,

Its just what we want,

Why do you care?

So look to your heart,

And then in our eyes,

Some of us die,

While we're still

I did heroin before fentynyl started coming to the area and when the new white dope came around it quickly became the only shit that could get me high.  Through my travels I've noticed that there is a difference in some users experiences with the drug. While in most people the effects are typical I've noticed an additional effect in a select few. I do not want to come off as insensitive in any way to anyone that experiences these effects that I am about to discuss, I am just curious if anyone else has noticed this definite pattern of behavior from other people or is it just me? 
  To begin I will start with the similarities of what I have seen these people doing. They usually start out with that swaying, dance fighting type moves, a lot of them clap, stomp around like they are a giant, some jump around in one spot. They sometimes do weird things with their fingers like crack them strangely or look like they are trowing up signs. They begin to talk to themselves and then the yelling starts. Every one of them uses multiple voices almost like they are acting out a conversation between multiple people and they use a different voice for each person. For some people you may only see one or two of these behaviors but the majority of them have the voices and/or have a conversation with themselves every time. The voices that are used are those of either a woman or a child, even when the user is male. I have noticed there seems to be a pattern that I am seeing but I do not want to share that at this point until I can get some sort of confirmation with others that may see these behaviors in people that they know.  Ive briefly looked to see if anyone has mentioned these affects anywhere on the internet and it seems as though none of this is being documented or reported.  While it does not affect me in these ways  i feel like its a real problem that needs to be looked into any experiences are appriciated",1523801924.0

And with that comes levels of loneliness never thought attainable. Well. If you're like me and you all are, which is why we get on so seamlessly; so nicely, you make these little-while friends any way you can. And sometimes these friends can't talk back. I'm sure you've all, at some point or another, befriended a stray cat or a homeless guy or a cloud or what the fuckever, just someone whose friendship you hadn't sought out but it fell in your lap, misery loves company and all that rot. And you embraced it because, well, every now and then we get low. So low. Too low. So it's a nice thing to have another to just be there beside you. Even if they're crawling up the wall. 

Well, I've been in one of these funks, in a bad way and even though we know it will pass, in the thick of it, it only feels like the first half of an eternity. Look, I'll admit it. I made friends with a bug. A ladybug, so at least I had some companionship with potential for a relationship but I wasn't so far gone that I didn't think for a second it wasn't a bug. But anyway, this little ladybug would crawl around my wall near my bed every day for the past two weeks. I mean, in a bugs life (our life, not the film) that's close to a Chinese empire's rule. That's forever. 

So, I'd be there, alone, sad, full of heartburn and dwindling booze, escaping warmth that came with the pills and an ever growing high tide of depression and I'd look over and she'd be there. This little tiny bug. A nothing. A hardly noticeable being that would walk and stop and walk and stop and crack open her back and lift her little plastic wings and flutter an inch or two and settle, still in eye-shot. It was company. I know it's insane, I'm not insane. It's insane but I swear I'm not insane. I think. But it was company. It was this thing that I could look at and truly tell myself, without any stretch of technicality or rationalization, that I wasn't alone. I wasn't. I had a pet. A pet I couldn't pet but a pet nonetheless. 

Well, we hung out off and on, playing the office on repeat back to back in a row for the 3rd time in my life, first time for her, I'm sure, I'm assuming but we watched. She really liked Dwight, I could tell. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan, I've grown to love jim and Pam but that's a whole other thing. Being my own therapist, without pay, mind you, I'm sure I'd just like a sweet girl. Obviously Michael is the reason to watch and the true best is David Brent but we can argue that in the comments. 

But we'd watch and Netflix would ask if we were still watching and we'd laugh and say, ""of course"" and hit play and continue on for another 3 half hours until prompted again. I wasn't alone. There was a little friend on the wall above my shoulder like just the angel without a counterpart. And just today, about an hour ago, I looked over and she was done. She quit watching, she quit crawling, she quit climbing the lampshade, no more random (to me) flutters and certainly wasn't venturing over to the pillow like that one time early on. She died. 

Now, she didn't overdose or anything, so I know I can't blame myself. In fact, I know she wished I'd lay off for a bit and maybe we could go out to the other side of the screen at some point. Or at least go down to the kitchen. But she's gone. And now I truly feel alone. I have literally no one near me that I can even look at that has their own agenda. And it sucks. 

Look, the whole point of this rambly, rambling nonsense is that when you feel more alone than you ever have, you aren't. If nothing else, I mean, *we* are here. But I get how that feels like it doesn't count. But don't feel like you're alone. We can all make ourselves get up and go outside and find a friend. Now, we also have to make sure that friend isn't going to hurt us but they are there. 

Okay. I've literally just realized that this is the most insane shit I've ever put to paper but whatever. Even if it's internet paper. Just, you're not alone and if you're unhappy reach out to someone, anyone. It will help. A first step doesn't have to be the destination. /r/Im14andthisdeep 

Okay. That's all. I had a friend. It was a little bug. And she just died. And I realize I need to shower and go try to be around people. We are social and it's really important to embrace that. 

I should truly try to stop. ",1523800984.0

I’m back to doing it every day again. Tomorrow is always the day I’m gonna try to not do any. Then that leads to I’ll just do one hit to get me through the day. To 2 isn’t bad to 3, 4, 5 and so on. 

I have a friend who works in the recovery business and he told me it’s scientifically proven that some people get to the point where they are addicted for life. No matter what they do, they will always go back to it. It’s like a point of no return and they can’t help it. 

The fact that I go to rehab, come out feeling great and can never even wait a day before I get high makes me worry a lot. 

Do I have any hope at all? I have cut back the past couple of weeks and I’ve made my dope last much longer. I’ve actually been proud of myself (which is really sad, I know). But what do y’all think? 

Thanks for all your comments ahead of time. People on Reddit are surpassingly always very supportive in situations like this and it gives me hope. But don’t hold back and just try to make me feel good. 

I plan on buying a bunch of Xanax soon and doing a detox on my own. That’s how I got through the dope sickness they last time I kicked without the help of a medical detox. Y’all have a good night. I’m nodding off.  (This isn’t a laughing matter but sometimes you gotta bring some levity to the situation). ",1523773377.0

Tar compared to fent in my opinion is much safer and has better legs although maybe harder on the veins. In my new town, in southern Ohio, what ive copped on the street is all powder dope. Some pure white, some white with a brownish tinge. Now this stuff in the mouth has an extremely low bitterness, and when snorted the smell reminds me almost of a perc 5 smell. (Yes I snorted those giant things when I was younger it was my intro to opiates.) All the powder dope I'd seen before now was when I lived in Europe and it almost always was very bitter and with a vinegar smell. Is the dope I've been getting fentanyl? It seems to have OK legs but then again its been years since I've done any opiates. What are the best indicators to make an educated guess of what this stuff is? (Some batches ive gotten have a weird coke like numbing in the mouth and throat but no coke flavor.) Thanks guys I'm back in town in 2 days and want to have an idea of what I'm copping.",1523773069.0

ANYWAYS back to my post, I was super sick yesterday all day as I’m not mobile and had to wait for my girlfriends car, I went and bought a 60 of black and cooked up half of it and did the whole thing which is a pretty big shot for me atm since this relapse has only been going on a month or two, I normally go home and do it but he was about 20 minutes away and I was unbelievably sick, so I did it in the car, and boy was I high, I knew I was way too high to drive since I’ve had a DUI as well (on my 18th birthday of all days) and I did not want to hurt anyone, so I just parked down the street and listened to music and texted some old friends for about an hour at least.

They’re able to continue living at home due to our parents fear of them failing if they were removed as well as the assumption that it wouldn't effectively resolve the addiction issue. Steps are taken to discourage their using such as removing access to their car, requesting monthly rent, and no access to internet. This does nothing to stop the usage behind closed doors sadly and he becomes highly aggressive and manipulative when confronted about it. False promises are made and the cycle continues. 

Recently they were given temporary access to the vehicle in order to attend a funeral but ended up using the vehicle to engage in what has been assumed to be stealing packages. They installed a lock on their room door to hide the products without getting permission which sparked action from our father to have him return the vehicle and remove the lock, both demands were brushed off. We forced entry to the room and discovered the many items which he was clearly using to fuel his usage. All items were bagged and removed from the room. Upon the siblings return he lost control and vandalized our fathers room door with a hammer as a petty act of revenge, I intervened and talked him down but he continued to yell incoherently. 

All attempts at reasoning with him resulted in aggressive responses, eventually my brother pushed our father out of rage where they were put in a choke hold by me to stop any further physical aggression, I held on to his neck while everyone was yelling frantically but let go after my father saw that he’d had enough. My brother eventually took a seat and the whole family was screaming at him for lashing out at my father. He finally attempted to have a conversation but it was full of redirection to my father and my faults.

We were considering calling the police when he shoved our father but opted not to after cooling off, it seemed like he was finally going to get kicked out but after making various false promises he is now putting all his stuff back in his room which blows my fucking mind. My family has always had a tendency to enable my brother after so many failed attempts at rehab and self attempts at sobriety, I'm afraid that despite his recently crossed boundaries that he will be allowed to continue his ways.

8ccvg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ccvg6/the_healthiest_addict/,2,https://redd.it/8ccvg6,nassaucoliseum,The Healthiest Addict,"My cousin's memorial service was today. It wasn't a funeral, no church or casket, it was held at an Audubon Society, with far more people than chairs. We were told to dress casually, and not nearly enough people took that seriously. I'm a bit of a hip, preppy sort anyway so I wore a Yankee hat with some skinny pants and a shirt I stole from my brother.

He liked the Yankees a lot. We're from a family almost entirely concentrated in Massachusetts, so he was one of few.

A friend of his spoke, talking about the courage of banality, of waking up every morning and getting shit done, of doing what you need to or feel obligated to, and how much that can wear you down over time. How much sobriety seems pointless and numbing and is just getting up to do the same old shit every day, the kind of capitalist ethics of this bravery in facing what one has committed to and what commitment takes out of you in late capitalist life, talking about the urge to get high and the way that it is, at the very least, something. It feels like something. It *is* something.

I remember his step-father referencing it before the service, and a nod to it in his mother's thoughts: the idea that he was the healthiest addict anyone had met, a nod to the way that he was an avid bike rider for a great portion of his life, even when using. He loved accomplishing and completing not in a sense of mere economic structures but in seeing things through, in creating better means for others to find a proper orientation and ideation of themselves, how he loved getting dirt under his fingernails and loved traveling across the country.

When they invited anyone who felt so compelled to speak, I found myself up there. I've been good at schmoozing, speaking in public and private, and most of all the art of extemporaneous speaking for quite some time. I don't remember that much of my speech apart from how much everyone seemed to like it, and I wish that were from some bars rather than a bout of depression-induced dissociation. 

We know it was heroin, but I still don't know how it happened, and considering some of the ways my dad and his talked about opiate use and how it should be opposed or controlled or dealt with in the panopticon gaze of contemporary law, I think I want to let it be a bit of a mystery. I can imagine it well enough anyway: he relapses enough to feel like he has a tolerance again, draws up a shot or two, is barely feeling the first when the second throws him a hot spot. Or maybe his relapse was just with some real good shit and he should've been sniffing it first. Whatever it was, it's a bit late for harm reduction. 

I feel hurt, empty, but what's worse is that I feel like using. I haven't had heroin in over a year, and I have been sober since I got into some shit back in January, since living at home is a drag. Before that I was showing that banal courage, that ability to drag myself out of bed every day for another shot at sobriety, for a whole year. When I hear all of these people talking about not trying it, about how it ruins people like him, I can't help but feel like I know it too well to ever forget. 

Can't unring that bell. 

I wish my bell were ringing, I wish I had a bundle or a g of some raw, I wish I had some white girl and some bars to go with it, I feel pathetic for being sad I never got to chase the dragon with him. Life is complicated and messy and good lines are neat and long and fat and will leave you on your ass.

I have this one vein that always hurts and stings like hell when I'm pushing in. It feels like I'm completely missing,  but if I try to register I'm still good. Also, I NEVER have any of the signs you see after a miss. It's on my wrist/hand, so you could hide the typical lump you get after a miss. Also, it hits me as quick as a normal hit would. 

I know that you're probably thinking that I hit an artery, but its definitely not an artery. 

1st. It's a very very dark red color. Not the bright red from an artery. 

2nd. It doesn't hurt at all to puncture the vein like a artery does. It's only when I'm pushing the plunger and the quicker I push the more it hurts.

3rd. When I register, the flow is the typical flow. I've always heard that an artery actually will push the plunger back from all the pressure. 

4th. The blood isn't frothy like artery blood is.

5th I can hit this vein in other area with no pain.


My only guess is that the vein is right next to a nerve and when I push in the plunger the vein can't move the dope quick enough and causes the vein to bulge and put pressure on the nerve. The pain feels a lot like nerve pain in that it burns very bad and I feel it up my arm.",1523748316.0

So I was just doing a shot of my regular fenty shit. My bf had to hit me this time. Because it was in a spot where I've never been able to hit it successfully, myself. And I really couldn't/didn't wanna miss the shot trying to do it there myself. The spot is right near the crook of my arm. But more to the left. Id say halfway between there and my elbow. 

Anyways, he ended up hitting me successfully. Easy as pie! And as he was pulling the rig out.. A fucking stream of blood like SHOT straight directly out of the hole. It actually looked just like a chick squirting from her pussy. Except it was only blood that came out. But it shot out.. like wicked far out and straight up in the air. It actually looked kinda cool when it happened lollll Like it reminded me of some alternative or abstract art!😎 Has this happened to any of you? Or have you seen this happen to someone else?



Also- totally random and off topic. BUT... As I was writing this post, my bf was coming out of Walmart and walking back to my car. And when he got there, he showed me what he found on the way that was just blowing in the wind. It was a $10 and a $5!😁 lol Even though it was only a measley $15.. I consider any cash found in a random parking lot, on the ground, to be pretty fucking cool. Have any of you found any money just chillin on the ground before?

I feel something for sure, but I know what oxy feels like, this is not that feeling. It’s more like a head and body lightness than that familiar euphoric warmth.

Although, my pupils are pretty pinned..

So, I’m curious as to what you guys think?

Fakes or are these pills just old or something?

Also, if they’re fakes is there any cause for concern? It’s been almost 3 hrs since my initial dose, would I know by now if I needed to be worried?

Another thing, tbh I’ve never had an oxy 30, I usually get hydrocodone 10’s. Is the experience any different?

I've been using opiates for 5 or so years, heroin for 2, but only started IV-ing a little over a month ago. My heroin use increased a lot since codeine became prescription only on 1 Feb. Before that I was mostly a codeine addict, and would get H when I could afford it. I was also unemployed up until 5 weeks ago so now I can afford all the H I want (except I'm currently in withdrawal because I lost my bitcoin cash deposit to a certain DNM and still haven't got my coins back).

There was no fent or anything in this dope, I just had too much. I got careless. I had too many times where I had too small a dose and had to make another shot, and I only have one vein I can usually get to, and only get 5 needles at once. I should have invested in good quality mg scales or at least used the crappy one I have. Other than that I was careful and sterile with everything.

The amount I dissolved was in one solid rock so it looked like much less than it was and I actually thought it wouldn't be enough.

I hide my usage from my boyfriend and housemates. I like to shoot up in the shower/bath (it's a showerhead over a bathtub). It's a nice place to do it, it's private, and I tend to bleed so being able to rinse it away right away helps. 

I didn't fill up the tub this time, I just turned the shower on so I could feel the warm water running down my back. I was excited that I got a vein so easily and injected it all at once. Usually I would titrate the dose, which means I don't get the same rush I could, but I'm less likely to die. This time I felt it, the rush. But I knew, as soon as I felt it, that I'd had too much. I had that feeling of losing control. I told myself ""it's okay, I'm still conscious, everything is fine"". I managed to take the needle out of my arm but didn't manage to put the needle cap back on. The next thing I remember was hearing my boyfriend calling my name from outside. I didn't know what was going on. I know that for a second I felt annoyed at being woken from such a peaceful slumber, even though I had no idea why I was lying asleep in the bathtub. 

Once I realised where I was and what was happening, I got up as quickly as possible and turned off the shower. I responded to his calls asking what was wrong. He was saying there was water leaking out into the hall. I was so confused because the bath was empty and the bathroom floor was completely dry. But my main concern was getting rid of all the evidence of my shooting up. I found the needle, couldn't find the needle cap so put it in a sharps container, and I quickly shoved everything else into a bag. 

I then got out of the bath and tried to find out what was going on. I was so fucked up, but luckily no one could tell. My housemate came into the bathroom and saw that the bath faucet had completely caved in, leaving a hole in the wall. I must have been lying there unconscious for 1 or 2 hours, after falling backwards and causing the hole in the wall, with the water running, which explains how it leaked into the hall.

At first I didn't even understand that I'd overdosed because of course I couldn't remember being unconscious. And I didn't understand how the faucet had broken because I didn't remember falling (I must have fallen after I became unconscious - which would make sense), and I was still so fucked up I couldn't feel the pain in my back. I remember staring at the broken faucet trying to understand, and I could barely even see because heroin affects my vision so much. 

I was in no state to do anything at that point. I stayed in the bathroom and got dressed but I got back into the bath. I wanted to make sure there was no more evidence. Plus the bath seemed like the safest place to be since I was barely functioning. I still hadn't found the orange needle cap, that last piece of evidence. Then I was pretty sure I saw it go down the drain and for some reason thought it was possible and necessary to get it out of there. I thought the plumber would find it and say ""here's what caused the issue"". At that point I still didn't understand what had happened. And my understanding of basic plumbing was missing because I was looking for the needle cap in the hole in the wall, amongst the broken tiles, after failing to get it out of the drain (it was properly down the drain). There was no way the plumber would come to fix a faucet and replace some tiles and find something that had fallen down the drain, but it took me a while to figure that out.

Eventually I decided sitting in the bath any longer would just seem even more suspicious, so I got out and helped soak up the water in the hall. I said I would get a plumber to fix the faucet. For some reason no one questioned how it broke.

I only pieced it all together later when I saw the bruises (and felt the pain) on my back, remembered the initial rush and feeling like I was losing control, and had vague memories of a peaceful dreamlike state while lying in the bath.",1523713909.0

During that time I learned a few, legal, tricks and loopholes. For those of you who have state funded insurance it’s a little harder to do but still possible. Say you have a prescription that has like a $500 copay because America is fucked. Go on that drugs website and search ‘savings card’. You’ll most likely have to enter an email or a phone number. In doing so you’ll receive some numbers that can be used in place of your state insurance card. They look like this 

ID Number - 123456789 (sometimes up to 3 letters in the beginning)
BIN Number - 123456
Rx Group - ABCDEF
PCN Number - 1234

Now keep in mind, if you have state insurance it will not work in conjunction with that insurance. However, with that being said, nine times out of ten the ‘savings card’ is cheaper than what the state is willing to pay. Sometimes pharmacies will be dicks and if they already have your state insurance on file, they won’t even apply the card for you by itself. Go to a different place and use just the savings card. 

If you have private insurance, you’re in luck. You will be able to use both your insurance as well as the ‘savings card’ to drop your copay even lower. 

I have had copays drop hundreds of dollars by doing this for customers. One time that sticks out is a women coming in just looking completely fucking defeated. Her husband was not taking his psych meds because they could no longer afford the full month, so they’d get as many as the insurance allowed a month. Which was NOT enough. I was able to get her a full months supply with an extremely low copay. Use this advice for your scripts people. I can’t guarantee that it’ll work on opiates, but it does on most (not all) meds, especially name brands. Be good to each other and stay safe.

Whats your thoughts?,"First off I never did this I only remember reading about it a while back so the details are a little fuzzy...

Basically, if I remember correctly it went a little something like this; someone in the US on government-sponsored healthcare goes to a lenient doctor (not pill mill) and is prescribed a prescription for opiates they don't *need* or they are over-prescribed. Then for much much less than street costs or online pharmacy costs which can now exceed $1 a mg... but either part of or the entire months supply from said person. The story I recall, someone purchased the entire prescription, a supply of **120** 30mg Roxycodone, for somewhere between $250-$300.

Like I said, I have never done this and it is unlikely I would ever even have the opportunity to - but shit if I could I would do it in a heart beat. Thats less than 1/10th the street price. This has to be by far the cheapest way to get real pharmacy oxy without getting your name put into the state database avoiding some of the unfortunate consequences that come along with that.

So what are your thoughts? Has anyone ever heard an easier way to get roxy this cheap with as comporable risk or less? Share your story if you'd like.",1523694646.0

- hot compress after each shot, even if it’s not a miss, to allow blood to flow and prevent bruising/swelling.
- shower at least 1x daily to renew and resurface skin. Clean skin is regenerating skin. Tracks seem to appear darker when you haven’t showered for 2 days and they’re purple and scabbed.
- exercise. Obvious one.
- hydration and daily vitamin
- **new works every single time. Knowing the proper way to IV and how to sanitize.**
- Wash your hands. Sanitize the area with an antiseptic foam or spray, alcohol pad. New cotton. Toss stick in sharps.

well my weed dealer is also a guy who is in a lot of pain and shit and he also happens to sell opiates. just tylenol w/ codeine (t3s), hydromorph 30s and dilly 8mgs. sometimes I get a hydro 30 but they cost $50 and make me super irritable and they don't come close to how fun snorting the dillies are. and how nice I fucking feel right now 

I heard pluggings even better. my guy lets me put shit on my ""bill"" and it's already at $200 (these canadian prices) so i told him to stop it at that no more until i pay him on tues.

i can maybe see this kinda getting outta hand because i feel like right now i'm fully appreciating the opiate high that is obtainable from these little pills. and it feels damn good. Methadone was very nice too the one time hehad it. I've tried heroin twice but each time got sicker than fuck so it doesn't really appeal to me (maybe too high of a dose?) but these DIlly 8mgs make me super talkative and give me a very very very nice energy boost and damn. just ndamn.

We sat in my car for a total of almost 2 and a 1/2 hours before I couldn't stand it anymore. His bullshit.  

Worst of all is right after I leave, I text my main connect hoping refill day is Monday as it should be (he had a heart attack last weekend but is OK and home now- they put stents in.) He pretty much eludes to him not getting his monthly Oxy script anymore by texting, ""I'm not planning for anything right now"" and when I ask him to call to explain he refuses, says maybe later and, ""Just not going to stress out because you are I can't do that any more you have to relax."" I asked, ""you can't do what anymore?"" And he said, ""stress"".  I mean, I do stress when refill day is later than it should be but he didn't even tell me a day! Do they not give opiates to people after heart attack?? He's been getting them for a decade! 

I'm terrified he's not going to get his script anymore. And that I am so fucked. I only know him and that asshole BC. My heart is pounding out of my chest. I'm so sick and another fucking blizzard is hitting this weekend and I feel like I can't breathe.  I could barely drive home after he sent those texts to me.  I haven't been in real withdrawal (with NOTHING) for more than a day in many years. I'm terrified. 

Sorry for all the words. Just needed to vent to someone who feels my pain. I literally have nobody in my life who knows I'm addicted. ",1523667971.0

my addiction  began with tramadol, we all know the deal,, strange chemical but can be fun and it’s  all over the UK because all we get is trams and codeine derivatives. Gps here shit their pants even trying to get valium - pussy Nhs dicks

Then i moves to dihydrocodeine and codeine phosphate - DHC was superior, phosphate more pure as it’s straight to morphine - but lasts 3 hours and ceiling seemed to be 450mg or so

DHC, 240mg + was a good dose and redoes no probs, americans arents exp with DHC i know, it feels like heroin but weaker obv, 400mg will nod your balls off. 

1 dhc
2 tramadol 
3 codeine 

lastly, i finally tries oxy, and it was garbage to me.
I would eat 20mg and snort 5mg lines until i got wherever and it was just stimulating and just buzzy and euphoric - it’s for ppl who wanna get shit done on opiates - i want the nod and not move - for the price, suuuuch a let down man

i would progress to eating a full 40mg and snort up to 20mg... nah fuck them
and their price. Oxy for me the most overrated opiate known in this world.

drugs i feel are amazing i’ve never tried (bear in mind i never shoot up so maybe oxy shot is amazing)

- dilaudid 
- oramorph?

I’ve been using ECP heroin for a few years off and on and my ROA has been IV for almost exactly a year now and I’ve never had this happen before. This dope I’ve been getting lately, every time I shoot it during the rush my heart starts POUNDING really hard and really fast, and my hands are uncontrollably shaking. It happens every time and lasts for about a minute or two. Otherwise it feels like regular dope, I’m not really wired or anything like I would be on an upper. I’ve shot meth before and never had my heart beating or the shaking like that either but I’ve never shot any other uppers so can’t really compare it...

And as an aside I did ask my dboy about it but he’s not the one bagging, he said he’s trying to find out what it’s cut with from the dude he gets it from though.

So I guess my questions are: has anyone experienced this before? And does anyone have any idea what it could be cut with? And/or is it a bad idea to keep using this particular batch? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out",1523663307.0

I’m 25, still live at home even though I have a degree, lost two jobs now in a month, have 0 motivation when it comes to job hunting, have no idea what I want to do for work, don’t see the point of waking up in the morning and have nothing to look forward to except for opiates but I have no connects, and I’m going insane with boredom. The only thing I can see myself really enjoying is playing guitar and making music but I have a long way to go in that department cause I suck. I don’t see the point in anything.

A woman walked passed my car and yelled to a gentleman sitting on his steps. This superman of guy was ready and had a narcan kit within reach, being a recovering addict himself. It took all the doses he had due to my size and amount I used. 

Waking up after being dead was such a weird feeling, almost fake. I can't believe I am alive in all seriousness. I owe everything to that man who just happened to be there.

I was taken to the hospital, evaluated and released, all in about 30 minutes. I wasn't arrested, no charges were pressed and they even left my rigs and the rest of my dope in the car. I think I'm still in shock.

Long story short my buddy said he would take me to the spot if I paid the Uber, so we get there and everyone is sold out. Now he is pissed because he has to get back to work, half an hour before I do. He gives me his money and gives me his plugs info. This guy Is my coworkers husband, honestly one of the nicest guys I’ve met in a long time. He’s a decent bit older then her but hey they have a kid and seem really happy so who am I to judge. 

Anyways I made sure it was cool if I hit her up when I wasn’t with him and he said that was fine because he can’t always get stuff for me with his schedule. Dude has never charged me a fee to middle and has fronted his money to pick up from his people and deliver to me at work before. 

So this particular blue plug is this black chick that gets to me at the bp I’m waiting at she honestly was cute as fuck too, but I would have said fuck it and gone back to work since it was getting late but my buddy was covering for me on lunch and my boss wasn’t there. 

She gives me three blues for 85 which was cool, and they were mbox 30mg. They were suuuuper light colored blue like so light they almost looked white. They were a smidgeon scuffed up but I assumed they were handled. 

I went to the bathroom and railed one after my Uber dropped me back at work, crushed up on a bill and to my surprise they were softer then the pink 10 k’s that I had been getting from the pharmacy (which are my personal favorite), they still required some pressure to crush but they crushed easier then any other blues I’ve had. They tasted right lovely drip and provided a nice euphoric oxy buzz. Talkative a little energetic.l, but not as amped as really energizing Kratom can be. 

Now when I get home from work I load up 1 full one and the bigger half from breaking a second and load it up for a shot. There was veeerry little residual left in the spoon and the water was very light blue. And there was a veeery nice rush that I got that I was not expecting, because I have shot a 218s and as that aren’t 30s too, the rush I remembered was not nearly as good.

 I’m not sure if my tolerance was fucked at the time from banging d’s and h and it just didn’t touch it, but I have been doing heroin and d’s and any anything I can get my hands on lately, and I’m pretty much back where I was at back then. 

It was a pretty strong rush that was better then the shitty heroin I got from my other middle on Tuesday. I was mad I wasted my money on that short lasting fenty trash so I decided to get blues because I could afford a few and i knew that the 3 over a couple hours would get me a euphoric high as opposed to getting fent bullshit again. 

Now my question is do the m boxes I got sound like sniffing and shooting experiences you all have had with them as well? The softness and intensity of the rush was indicative of something like fent but the high was all oxy. Very euphoric not sedating. I did nod out a little bit smoking the last half, but it even tasted right. Are the mboxes this magical normally or do you think I got fakes? They didn’t seem to be pressed with fent, unless it was some strange fentalogue. I’m tempted to send a piece of one to a testing lab to see what’s in them, if it’s some type of new research chemical or maybe it’s heroin that’s pressed into blues. But the good heroin I’ve done lately felt different then that rush, I’ve never had anything quite like it. Fuck me I realized I had 92 left in my bank account just now too, but the banks closed and I don’t have my card, should be coming in the mail soon. I want to get three and load them all into the same shot, 45 Mg shot was amazing I think a 90mg shot would be orgasmic. I almost liked it more then diluadid...",1523660486.0

Our thoughts really do seem to create a reality.

I've been living in such a negative frame of mind lately and it seems to just make everything worse! 
(Well I mean I guess duh lol) 

But seriously though, so much of this is mental: 
Like how we will be withdrawing our balls off, in such a shitty head space and yet once we have the relief in our hands it's like the symptoms seemingly disappear.

Or like how when you know you'll get to score soon. Or even worse when you know you can't score again.

For me it's like I never feel the ""last bag"" if I don't know when the next ""fix"" is.

Or how the week prior to rehab I could not feel high for the life of me because I was too damn stressed about the pending mental and physical doom of detox.

So that being said I'm really trying to use this principle to be more positive and make sobriety a tiny teeny bit easier.

Idk it's hard as fuck. Obviously these drugs fuck with our chemical makeup and how we think and react. 
Yet yesterday I had this moment where I just genuinely wanted nothing to do with dope or getting high. I did the bare minimum amount to stay well and usually this is hard af for me because I am so use to obsessing over my use and feeling normal. 

But again yesterday my head was above water all day. I wasn't necessarily positive but I wasn't dwelling in negative either. It was bearable.
I keep busy and just was so turned off by the idea of getting high. It's like my brain finally has made a connection that getting High and continuing to use= pain and misery.

Bleh. 

Just random thoughts from my mind. 

(Side note- yesterday my power got shut off and I have $70 to my name for 4 days..normally I'd be going APE SHIT. my mind would produce nothing but negative thoughts. Thus making it a million times harder to get through a day.
Yet idk, I was ok. I think for the first time in awhile I had a bit of a hold on my mental state.

I ran out early last month and landed myself right in the heat of withdrawal when my dad visited from 18 hours away. He drove 18 hours to spend 3 days with me, drunk and withdrawing, and I completely ruined our visit. 

I had good intentions to do better with this refill. I have a 7 day pill box. I cut them into halves and set out my weeks worth. 

Then that weeks worth ran out and I kept dipping. I'm right back up to a dosage that's triple my prescribed daily amount. The worst part of this refill is my doc cut a pill a day so I am already working with 30 less than normal. 

I still have half my script left but Idk how long that will last. The kicker is I'm not even enjoying them. Usually I'm active and energetic when I take my oxy but I had the flu 2 weeks ago and my body has just changed. I've slept all day every day this week. I feel stupid and sick on them.

I can't let myself sit here and go through wd this weekend cause that would seriously suck for my family, but come Monday, I'll have all day all week to deal with the effects. 

If I can stick to my dosing schedule I'll have at least 40 left on Monday. Even if I go to the excess I'll still have a weeks worth left of my script. I think it will help the wd knowing I'm sitting on pills. I won't feel so desperate. I can start taking then the week before my refill.

And I didn’t want anyone to think I was trashy or untrustworthy or any other stereotype attributed to addicts. 

He said he won’t ever judge me because he knows sometimes people get caught up in shit they never meant to get caught up in. He told me I was strong and smart and that I’ll get through this. 

I feel good on one hand but embarrassed and scared on the other. We aren’t super close, probably why I even admitted it to him— I could never willingly admit this to my close friends/family because I don’t want to hurt them.

Im currently focusing on Oxycodone if that makes any difference.

Firstly, anything that will potentiate Oxycodone so that a lower dose is required.

Secondly, drug combinations (such as benzos) that add to the experience. 

I really value the opinion of this community and the knowledge that lies within. This is why I am asking opinions over just browsing potentiator forums. 

Just as a side note, I am aware of the potential pitfalls (over and above drug use for recreational purposes) so there is no need to be conservative.

Background: we are habitual users with a daily habit of anywhere from a half to a whole G on a typical day (and we snort it). Anything we get we split down the middle. We take turns buying it for the day but it isn't quite 50/50, I buy more than she does, and usually get a greater amount than she does when she's the one purchasing. Because of this I feel that I'm doing more to support our habit than she does. 

But here's the argument: I'm currently (and newly) unemployed but I receive a pretty decent inheritance check every 2 weeks and I'm the sole buyer for us until that money we budgeted for our habit is gone(typically anywhere from 5-8 days), at which point she takes over until the next check comes. 

She is also unemployed but doesn't receive a check like me, so shes always finding new and exciting ways to generate money (and no, she doesn't trick or Rob people for it in any capacity).

Her most recent hustle, and probably the most clever IMO, was approaching people and asking if they can help her with a bachelorette party scavenger hunt that she has until Saturday to complete (today is Thursday). One of the tasks is that she has to get a minimum of $50 in donations from strangers (from any multitude of ppl, she isn't  asking 1 person to donate $50 themselves) . 

To further legitimize her ruse so as not to appear like a scam she tells the ""donator"" that she has to get a pic with them and the $ and have them initial her scavanger hunt paper to ""prove she isn't cheating"" by using her own money to accomplish this task. Pretty scandalous and quite clever right?

Anyway obviously her way takes a lot more effort than simply getting a check, but her way also generates less funds and takes a lot longer than my way. It took about 3-4 hours to come up with $60, which is really the bare minimum amount we need to get enough for us to split and be Ok for the day. 

She says that even though were typically only getting enough to get by  when she's the one buying that her contribution is actually worth more than mine bc of the amount of time/energy, and thought that goes in to her plans. 

I disagree. 

So we are giving the argument to you good people to decide once and for all who's doing more for our habit- my greater amounts with almost no effort, or her smaller but acceptable bags for us to split.

TLDR: I spend more money on H for us to split 50/50 than she does with little to no effort via a bi-weekly inheritance check/ once that $ is gone she takes over and buys smaller bags but with great effort and time consuming plays. Who's making the greater contribution to our needs?


Addt'l info on her scavanger hunt play: to try to encourage people to ""donate"" more $ for the game she says that all the money generated is going towards the honeymoon for the fictitious couple and that whomever comes up with the most money by the hunts and will receive a call bonus and a day spa certificate and whomever had the largest single person donation will also receive a cash prize.


I've included pictures of the pretend scavanger hunt rules and tasks she created at her request to show the people she's asking for donations from so you can see how much effort she put in to this plan.",1523599116.0

I've been snorting pills/heroin for the last 7 years. The past 2 years have been strictly h and between. 5 and a gram a day. I switched to the needle 2 months ago because my breathing had gotten so bad that I couldn't walk up stairs without being out of breath. Also, I got tired of living with the ""death rattle "" at nights for the past year. I used to use a netti pot fairly regular, but was always shocked that NOTHING ever came out.

Fast forward to now...

I have a major sinus infection and I'm blowing ridiculous amounts of stuff out of my nose. However, what has me concerned is seeing a thin rubber like membrane that I'm also blowing out in small pieces. (Since its coming out of my nose, its actually pretty big). They best description would be a rubbery thin film thats the thickness of a condom and you have to actually tear apart to break up.

I'm assuming that what this is, is my sinuses had gotten a coating of drugs that over time had formed a rubbery film? If this is the case, it would explain why A. I never got anything out after using the netti pot... and B. Why my lungs had gotten so bad so quick. My sinuses no longer were absorbing anything because it basically had something similar to a condom that was covering everything that the dope would have normally attached to?

My questions are this...

1st. Has anyone else experienced this?

2nd. Does my theory seem plausible?

3rd. Any idea how to get rid of this? The only time I ever get this stuff out is when I have a sinus infection. The last SI mainly had this film coming out of the right nostril and now, it's the left nostril. (I'm getting regular heavy mucus out of the other nostril).

4th. Can you think of any other possible reason/thing this is?

Anyway, she charged $10 for the 18's which is a great price for oxy  imho. Well when she got upgraded to the 27's she left the price the same - $10 for basically 30mg of oxy. IMHO you gotta be a fucking idiot to turn that down but fuck if I can get anyone interested in them.

I've been on Vivitrol for about 14 days and its pretty terrible stuff IMO. INSANE insomnia and a strange kind of crippling depression and agoraphobia-ish type anxiety i never had before, along with other more minor physical symptoms. (Pain and stomach issues.)

Because I can't handle this shit, I've been trying to research a way to break through that infernal shot, to little avail. Been reading about how Suboxone/bupe can bypass it, so naturally i acquired some and insufflated 4mg.

I was quite underwhelmed, and though i doubt it was placebo for various reasons, I did manage to feel a teeny bit less anhedonic (i can actually talk without a flat affect, and leave my house--seriously.. I wish the psychiatrist would've warned me about these issues (i did ask), but the way he presented it, Vivitrol is as harmless as chamomile tea.)

Digging online reveals that most people who have success breaking through vivitrol do so by IVing the bupe/Suboxone..usually in like 1-2mg amounts.

I only have Suboxone (no subutex) so I'm a little wary of risking putting myself through PWD (considering the naloxone) though is that even really an issue when you get down to the fundamental pharmacokinetics?

Shouldn't the residual naltrexone perhaps block the naloxone? I know for me, bupe itself doesn't block naloxone like it does for many folks who IV Suboxone. (I had a bad experience IVing it some years ago, so first hand experience in that regard.) Really tempted to try it though, as pathetic and desperate as that may sound.

Also I've seen tramadol mentioned but much less info seems available on that. I'd appreciate it if anyone has any information on that, or anything else that would displace the damn naltrexone on my mu-opioid happy spots.

Are there any other methods to screw with the injection itself, apart from cutting oneself open? Like some kind of way to metabolize the gel release thing faster than usual, perhaps some kind of ass cheek exercises combined with grape fruit juice and hydroxycut? (I joke.)

But seriously, is there any way to nullify this thing? You'd think they'd (the drug company) create a way to reverse the shot in case of emergency adverse symptoms.

Please, any tips or anecdotes please! I am desperate .",1523570735.0

We’ve gone hunting a few times together, played pool, he’s chilled at my place and vice versa. He’s on pain management, relative of a really good friend. He likes to play games sometimes.... “I’ll be good at 2pm tomorrow “. You call at 1:00, no answer. 3 days later you get a text... “are you coming to grab these or what?” Than he bitches you out for not being there at 2pm.

Today is day 7 of waiting for what I needed 7 days ago, his uncle has been sick and actually passed yesterday. “He will call me when it’s good, don’t call him”. Sad part is, his uncle really is sick and I assume did pass away. I did the dt’s already, took my normal kratom daily.

I have only tried cold-medicine with codeine before, around 100mg 3 times, and it was fairly enjoyable. I have also been addicted to alcohol for the past 2 years (not very heavy use but still every day).


Therefore, i bought 5 30mg IR oxycodone a couple of months back from a guy with a script, but I have been unsure whether I want to go down this road or not. In my mind I would use occasionally for as long as I could until I ran out of money, in which case I would end it (unless doing opiates changed my outlook on life).


In the best case scenario, I would be able to use opiates for a while, possibly become addicted and maybe have some sort of revelation about life. In this scenario, finding a purpose in life would far outweigh the negative effects of addiction, as I would be alive instead of dead (since most normal people hold life above all others, it wouldnt matter if i were addicted as long as i was alive)


In the worst case scenario, I would use opiates, fall in love with them and become addicted, run out of money, and then still not have the courage to off myself, and I would be stuck in a ""mental prison"" which according to what I've read here for the past 3 years is 1000x worse than regular depression.

So, how can you tell what your current tolerance is and if you can safely redose.

Say for example; I take 40mg of OC at 2pm (crushed/parachuted) Then at 3pm I snort another 20mg. Then 3.30pm, another 20mg dose. 

Say then at 4.30pm I'm feeling high but would like to be higher. How do I know what a safe amount would be to take. I've never had a problem and my doses have probably maxed at 160mg throughout the day. 

The only guide I go by is obviously if I'm feeling good but also measure heart rate. If that drops below 60bpm, I tend to slow it down. Is the dose response curve fairly wide if you are resonably experienced?

Once every few weeks to once every couple months. I decided to buy some kratom from my local head shop. Honestly it's really boring to me. A couple grams gives me a mood boost for the rest of the day. 7-12g very very very slightly relaxes me and makes me kinda talkative. No euphoria though. Feels like it wants to be an opiate but obviously isn't lol. Anyways I noticed something. I took about 3g in the morning (noon is my morning time) and went about my day. Hadn't used opiates in a month or two. I got ahold of a nice 30mg of hydrocodone my usual dose. Ate it with a semifull stomach. It kicked me in my ass something similar to the first time using MDMA euphoria. Used a couple times since and I've gotten nothing like that. I'm going to take a couple weeks break and try it with kratom again. I was just wondering if anybody else has had this experience or can confirm this happens. I thought it would have the opposite effect. Would taking kratom when the highs going away be effective? I'm just really curious as to how it can potentiate euphoria,1523523756.0

My doses are anywhere from 30mg to 60mg depending on if I've been using daily or been taking breaks. Anyways. Even on super heavy doses now and with breaks the euphoria has gotten really weak. Only lasts like an hour and even my nods are getting weak. So I've switched to oxy. While oxy is way better for my money as I'm taking 15mg-20mg for a similar if not cheaper price than the hydrocodone and getting the old euphoria I was missing, I'm getting no nod at all. The nod and euphoria really went amazing together. I don't want to take a whole 30 and get nauseous just to attempt to nod. Is there anything you guys recommend for me to get a nod? Will like .5mg - 1mg of xanax do it for me? I take about 3mg-4mg to get high on xanax and that's a pretty weak one to me. With no tolerance I can't feel a bar so .5mg to 1mg is like nothing to me. My blackout range on xanax is about 6mg. I can take 5mg and remember everything and not be too crazy. I know those doses sound crazy I don't know why I have such a high natural tolerance to xanax but I do. Sorry about explaining my Xanax tolerance here I was hoping it'd help. Is there another opiate you would recommend to achieve the old hydrocodone effects? I don't want to do heroin again I don't really like it. Maybe what we have here is just really shitty.

Can you go ahead and take suboxone the next day and keep on with your maintenance or do you have to wait until withdrawal to start sub again even though you never felt the opiates and they were never able to bind to your receptors? 

I was under the impression suboxone wipes all the opiates out of your system, and unless you wait long enough after your last suboxone (24-72 hours) dose you will not be able to feel anything from opiates.  If that is true then do the opiates that you tried to relapse with even stick to receptors in your body or do they just get flushed out as if you hadn't taken a thing and you ended up just ""wasting"" pain pills?

Lately i made the stupid decision to use again. Thought i could just have a little nostalgic fun with heroin again. I scored 0.1 just for a shot or two, sounded like a good idea at the time. And ive had such great control with my drinking and weed lately i thought id be fine.

Well time flew and 5 days later i was still using, at 0.25g a day.

Swore he wouldn't no matter what i said.
I can cold cop in open air markets here but the gear is usually awful and even in my peak of addiction id avoid it unless i had to.

Dont take your clean time for granted, i did and nearly fucked it all up. The battle isnt over either but im insistent on staying the fuck away from it. I nearly lost my sobriety from heroin, and in doing so risked everything that's important to me.

First regular heroin use: 3 months ago [0.5g snorted 2-4 times a week]).

I had convinced myself I could chip and would be fine. But over the past few weeks ive been withdrawing moderately every single week on off days. So Ive decided to quit and thats where I am now. 48 hours clean and only used once in the last 6 days.

I know I can do this. Im not feeling great but better than day 2 of last weeks withdrawal. Chills, toilet, zero motivation, aches, you know the drill. But given im not feeling horrendous now I know this is physically manageable. **But the psychological element is scaring me.**

I was diagnosed with a dissociative anxiety disorder in Jan 2017 and spent 6 months recovering from a deep hole i didnt ever think anyone could reach (this compared to that is nothing). I discovered opiates late last year and here I am now. Reading about PAWS and depression/anxiety after getting clean is frightening. Feelings of having thrown my hours upon hours of mental health work down the pisser, etc. I know im not in the same place as early 2017. Ive grown and gained immense insight into psychology and proper mental hygiene, things that wont be taken away by my recent use, but I cant help shake the feeling I've really fucked up. My self confidence and image is pretty poor and I feel pretty filthy.

Idk, I guess im looking to share my feelings with you guys who know the context well. Maybe get some reinforcement or encouragement. I know im doing the right thing but its hard not to hate myself for these indulgences and the potential post-acute effect they may have.",1523507393.0

We try our best to source enough free Narcan and other supplies, but more often than not we run out before the shift ends. This sometimes causes our visitors to get pretty irate, as if we are hiding it from you. Trust me, I'd rather you have Narcan than not.

We're always there to help you with anything, even if it's a referral to a medical tent, shelter, Suboxone clinics, etc. Just know that we don't know everything. We don't always know what syringe will be best for what drug, so please don't get upset with us or think we are being judgemental just because we don't  know the best way to IV heroin into your neck or femoral. We love getting suggestions on how we can better serve the community, so please don't be shy :). 

A lot of us have to write down everything we give away, so please also bare with us if you are here for a large pickup and we have to ask you to repeat the list a few times because we can't always understand.

Lastly. If you don't have a job/career, have daily responsibility, no bills or on welfare or any kind of social situation where if u wanted to you could sleep in your living room for weeks at a time doing nothing and nothing will go south in your life, you have NO EXCUSE to not quit if that is what u want to truly do. You KNOW how to do it, but put saftey valves in place to allow urself to give in. Turn your phone off. Keep it off. Deal with the withdrawals , don't check your Facebook, don't allow anyway to contact or someone to contact u regarding using. Give your  laptop to someone or do whatever it takes to separate yourself from the people that will be your rope when your sick as a dog, depressed, and worst of all, beginning to let the user part of your brain plan a justified relapse. If you relapse out of just withdrawl , you need to get some professional help , as you don't want to quit, at least not enough to do it unsupervised.

My post on here helped me realize how much I was enabling him, and shortly after I gave him a 60-day notice to move out. I also did a walk through of the house (with our mom, who had been deep in denial). There were syringes everywhere and it was pretty traumatic to see how bad things were.

Anyway, the move out date (March 30) came and went. I didn't file an eviction because he did open up to our mom about his heroin use and said he wanted to get help. He went in for an evaluation and got state-funded insurance. He supposedly detoxed on his own at home and will be starting outpatient treatment. 

While there has been some progress, I am concerned he is not really serious about treatment and not totally convinced he is clean. He still refuses to respond to my text messages or calls, has not attended any meetings, and declined inpatient treatment even though he is eligible for it. He seems more concerned about people finding out about his addiction than working on his sobriety.
