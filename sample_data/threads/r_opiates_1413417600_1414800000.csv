The problem is, I've been trying to get clean on my own. I bought two 8mg sub strips, and have been taking as little as possible over the last 3 days. With the plans on slowly decreasing my minuscule dose already and then hope to stay clean.
I know I will relapse if I don't get help. Hell, I was planning on offing myself as soon as the moment felt right. 

As for when I will be going to inpatient, I do not know. But it will be within the next few days at the latest.

Any experiences?,"Well, for 2 weeks now, I have a new connect. He is a truly wonderful person, he does not use any kind of opiate or other drug, just sells Heroin. I am an atheist gay greek, and he is a muslim bisexual tunisian. 

Every single time -without exceptions- he makes me exceptional deals. With 5 euros I get 350mg of excellent quality dope. With 10 euros I get 1 gram of the same quality. I have seen with my own eyes the deals he make with other customers of his (because he works from his house) and honey, they are nowhere near the same. Other customers get 50-100mg for 5euros and 150-200mg for 10euros.

Such quality is nowhere to be found in the city. It is a normal occurence, though, for dealers that don't use, to find and manage to sell fire dope responsibly. 

Okay, now, I realised from the beginning that such a good deal doesn't come out of nowhere. His eyes always shine when he meets me, and they are sober eyes; he just drinks a small glass of wine with his meals. Nothing more.

I am not an innocent dove; I escort for a livign -amongst other day-jobs-, but it is not the same. The money I get from escorting do not go all for dope. I give a portion to help my mom, I buy food and groceries, and of course, dope. However, it is not the same thing with straight up having sex with your dealer.

We haven't done any thing of sexual nature yet; just flirting (because I kinda like him). If we do, it is certain that he will shower me with free H. I don't know how to feel about this.

Earlier I was at a loss and ended up coppin' a bag from a random guy in a parking lot somewhere. I started smoking the dope that I got from him, and I thought it was good.

I wasn't even craving bad at all, I just wanted to feel a good opiate high again.

I am wondering if I am in a dangerous zone right now. In my opinion, I don't really regret it and the high was good. However I did notice that the peak didn't last as long as I wanted it to. It was still good though.

Most people freak out when they relapse, but I'm in a better place in life right now than when I was using last year heavily, so I'm not feeling to down about it. To be honest I think the amount of days you've been clean don't really mean shit. It's all about the mentality. 

Are there any successful chippers out there? I've read a few stories here about some rules about doing it well. If you have what you consider to be a good, happy, fulfilling life while chipping on the side please post and please share your techniques so I don't fall back into full blown addiction.

THIS GUIDE IS PURELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.  OPIUM CAN BE HIGHLY ADDICTIVE AND LIFE DESTROYING.  PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.***

To begin, obtain some Poppy Seed Tea (PST).  Many guides can be found on the internet on how to acquire it.  Brewing PST for human consumption is also illegal in most places.  When you do brew your tea, it is optional to use a slight amount of lemon juice to help strip the basic salts off of the seeds.

After the tea has been created, let it set there until the small amount of lemon/large amount of poppy salts settle at the bottom of the container.  *Carefully* decant the clearer liquid floating on top of the settled goods at the bottom.  Poor out very slowly as to not disturb the sediment at the bottom and stop to let the liquid rest if the sediment is about to be poured out.

Repeat this until you can not decant the heterogenous solution any further.  Depending on the weight of seeds that you brewed, you should have a different amount of liquid.  If you brew about a pound of PST, a large plate may suffice to evaporate off the water.  After the liquid has been transferred, you can try to decant some more sediment from the clearer liquid that is remaining, or just drink it!  [This is what the sediment may appear like after being poured onto the plate.](http://i.imgur.com/iQzFMV0.jpg)

Simply waiting for the liquid to evaporate off of your flat container/plate/tupperware which can be scraped/etc containing the liquid can take a long time, but will work.  You could get a large bowl with hot water and place the plate on top of that to heat the plate up without destroying the contents directly on top of the stove or anything like that.  [How it looks when it is about 75% done.](http://i.imgur.com/YF9Pi9y.jpg)

[Roughly about 95% done at this point.  You just have to wait for this to turn a bit less wet, which can take up to an hour.](http://i.imgur.com/y7yhfBx.jpg)

This new fauxpium (lol sorry) will probably burn better with  tobacco or legal marijuana.  I do not condone breaking any laws in places where the smoking of marijuana is illegal.

Also if you have any stories feel free to share. I'll share one.**

Sooo I just had the worst shit of my life. I haven't had a good shit in a while so I knew today I had to force myself to get it out. Well fast forward to me sitting on the shitter for more than a half an hour pushing to no avail except for maybe 1 or 2 deer pellets. I look down and see something in the reflection of the water. My fucking rectum is prolapsing. I quickly work my hand down there to check it out and feel around. Well basically what I found was my rectum with huge hemorrhoids and in the middle were pieces of hard shit stuck to get out. My body was actively trying to pass these shit rocks but they were stuck, picture a pipe and you throw a bunch of rocks down them but the jagged sides catch each other at the bottom and they can't fall through. It was like that. So at this point I'm freaking out because my body is trying to push them out but they ain't going nowhere. What do I do? I start digging them out one by one. I was hoping that when I got one out it would loosen them out so they all came out naturally. Nope. Constipation doesn't give a fuck, I was digging them out, some so stuck in my ass I had to really get a grip on them to the point where shit was digging into my fingernails. Well after I get a couple out, keep in mind there's still a bunch, I look at my hand and it's basically covered to blood. Panic sets in and I go back to digging. I get out as much as I'm comfortable getting out because at one point I thought to myself there's no way I'm fisting myself to get hardened pieces of shit out. Anways, I'm through now and just trying to take it all in because this has never happened to me. I'm thinking if I should go to the hospital or not, when can I actually take my shot, I wonder how much shit is still inside, etc. So I feel down there again and it's closing up but the hemorrhoids are huge. I'm like great now I won't be able to sit down. Well I clean up the toilet, wash my hands 1000 times, then I jump in the shower. While in the shower, I go to clean my ass and to my surprise the hemorrhoids are gone. They went back in my ass or something. So I finish showering and I have vowed to myself that I will never go that long without shitting ever again.

The mere thought of it is probably enough to draw a rare chuckle from the most jaded and depressed of addicts.  All my efforts to conserve have always been in vain, but I have finally done some things that actually worked, even if they weren't entirely intentional at the time.

Since I only have access to BTH, I guess it may not be relevant to everyone here, but, 

1) Don't hit your trails!
- This one definitely takes a lot of willpower, making it a useless tip for many, but it can still work for some. Anytime I pick up more than a gram, after I've finished smoking the main dot/blob/whatever, I've gotten into the habit of just leaving the trail be, folding up the foil, and putting it away for WD-me to find it days later. Especially if you smoke near bedtime, it's way easier to just try falling asleep after smoking and totally forgetting about the trail in the morning if you have a sizeable stash to pick at.

2)Immediately after picking up, put a few small pieces on some foil and just store it away
-Again, if you're picking up decent amounts, doing yourself this favor really pays off once you run out. Once you start working on a gram, you're likely to forget about a few pieces you have left lying around if you have a bigger chunk to work with

Finding these little nuggets when frantically examining foils as you enter WD feels awesome, and it can buy you a day or two of time before having to go out on the hunt again, without actually affecting the quality of your high from the sessions you took them from. These amounts go such a long way in tight spots yet do nothing for you when you're already high, it makes all the sense in the world to just put little bits aside, but rationality tends to be ignored with these drugs.

Anyone care to share other little habits or tips that tend to pay dividends in the long run like this? Fooling yourself into saving tar is a tough task but by no means is it impossible

I am referring to this http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2bhea8/cold_copping_at_4am_crazy_adventure_story_inside/

Since I love stories like this and know everyone else here does, I will do my best to replay the events of that night. 

OK so it was 1AM and I had $7 in my bank account. I knew that in one hour, at 2AM i would be getting $75 direct deposit. I would be able to  withdraw $80, and buy a bundle from my guy who has been awake at this hour every week for the past 3 months. 

So the money comes in I grab the car and as my luck would have it he isn't picking up. Fuck man. I am sick sick sick at this point and as we all know when you have that expectation of getting something, that can sort of power you on, but as soon as that falls through you feel sicker X10000. 

Ok so I start making calls. I finally get in touch with a guy I met off this subreddit in the past who has always been good to me. He says to come on down and he should be able to help me if I throw him 2 bags. No problem! I drive a half hour to his apartment. Call, call call, and of course, same deal. Guess he passed out or something, no dice. 

I have no other numbers, no other connects, it is 3AM I am driving around queens NY and say fuck it. I'm going to the jamaica LIRR station because I have cold copped from there beforehand. Never at fucking 3AM but hey, I am dying at this point. 

I park my car and see a crackhead doing crackhead like things. I walk by him smoking a cigarette, he asks me for one and, well, you know how it goes. We start talking over a smoke, he is going a mile a minute clearly zooted and saying yeah yeah yeah he can get from his man T we just gotta go over there yeah yeah $70 bundle just throw me $10 yeah yeah yeah. Sketch meter is on overload but i am SICK SICK SICK. 

So I say ok let me just go to an atm and get my money. We arrive at one and it isn't reading my card! The magnetic strip got scratched up or something and it just wouldnt read it! I am going crazy at this point just how unlucky can I get! The crackhead is getting pissed off as well thinking that I am just trying to fuck with him so he takes me to this 24 hour deli to try their ATM. 

It was the sort of ghetto ATM that gives out $10 bills and charges you a lot in fees and having like $82 in my account, even if it went through, i wouldn't know if it would give me the $80. So im trying at the ATM and then the crackhead sees some other crackhead he knows and they start GOING AT IT in the fucking DELI! Something about money or some other crackhead stuff and I am this skinny white guy like WTF where am I it is 3:30AM and I'm in Jamaica and holy shit this is wack. 

I somehow get the $80 and the crackheads eyes beam up. We start walking, he takes his phone out to 'call his guy' but clearly the guy isn't picking up. He starts saying how we are going to need to take a cab or walk ten blocks deeper into the hood to his boys house so we can get it. This is where I finally draw the line. 

I say no, I'm not going, peace out bro. You had your chance to make some money, called a bunch of different people, said they were there, lied to me, im not getting into a cab with you to go god knows where. 

It was like I turned a switch on the crackhead or something. While he is a crackhead he is much bigger than me, I am 5""11 quite skinny like 135 he is 6""2 easy and pushing around 200. I turn away and start walking back towards that deli, he turns and starts walking towards me. I pick up the pace, he picks up the pace, I start to run, he starts to run. And at this point, it is nearly 4 in the fucking morning and I am in jamaica queens RUNNING FULL SPEED away from a crackhead!

Luckily his crack lungs couldn't handle more than 1 minute of running on top of which I ran track in college so I got back to the deli where there were other people and cab drivers so this guy wasn't going to attack me in front of other people. (or maybe he would have? i dont know, point being is that I ran after him)

So I am walking back to my car and I turn the corner and I see three people sitting there just waiting and they were at an angle where they can pretty much have seen what just happened. They all say 'man you lucky you didn't go with that guy he wouldve robbed you silly boy'. 

Turns out, all three are methadone maitenece patients waiting for the clinic to open at 630AM so they can be first in line to get their dose! I tell them I am looking for dope and they say hey, just stick around another hour and this guy that come in will have and you can buy some. 

An hour goes by, it is 6AM, some more patients stop by to wait but not this guy. They tell me not to worry and one of them even split a xanax bar from me (that they purchased from one of the patients that just arrived) out of pure kindness to 'hold me over'. That my friends is how sick I was. 

And well, it happened, the guy came, I bout a bundle and gave 3 bags and $10 to split between the three people that were originally there. 

And while the xanax surely played a part in this (it has been many months since i have done a benzo up until that point) that was some of the best dope I have ever gotten. 

Was it worth it to go through all of that? As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, I am clean now, and I do not have an answer to that question. I suppose you can decide for yourself if it was worth it in the end.

Unfortunately my monthly doctor appointment isn't for 6 days and it was a bad month for me pain wise. Im not normally someone who runs out but I have probably 4-5 times in my 6 years of being prescribed opiates for rheumatoid arthritis. In the past though its only been for a couple of days so this will be the longest I've had to deal. Obviously the weekend is ok because the gabapebtin makes me extremely tired and I can sleep a vast majority of the time. But Monday its back to work for me. Thankfully I work from home via telecommute so thats a big plus but I still have a job that requires a lot of mental stuff as well as being alert.  So the rough part is that and I can't take time off because I'm out of vacation days as I use them for various medical appointments throughout the year. 

Bottom line is I'm tapped money wise and have nobody I could borrow from for the 6 days until my doctor and when I get paid. Like I said I do have gabapebtin and a large supply but the tiredness it causes along with the mental part of withdrawals hit me harder than most makes me panic looking forward to this next 6 days. Anything else I can use that might be around the house to help? I have Tylenol and I also have meloxican thats an anti-inflammatory.

I just have very little experience with hallucinations, and I'd love to hear your stories. I mentioned I started seeing things out of the corner of my eyes like, 6 hours or ago. Sometime like that.

Now, I've started seeing this horse face, but only in reflective surfaces. Particularly along the border of the computer screen. There's a lamp almost right behind me that lights it up. When I first saw him, it was out of the corner of my eye, like usual. All the time, I see 2D and 3D pictures and shapes of people, animals, or whatever, made out of whatever stuff is lying around, like in a pile of clothes, or just one crumpled up shirt, or the overlapping of some stuff that's far away and some stuff thats closer (I can't remember what thats called, something-something-perspective). Pretty sure that's normal, I'm assuming you know exactly what I'm talking about.

It happens more often in reflections; like, every once in a while I'll suddenly see something in the corner of my mirror or behind me while I'm doing make up that looks like its real and in my room, and I freak out out for that split second I got surprised, before turning around. 

So when I see a horse head out of the corner of my eye, I turn to look at it, more curious about what combination of shit I'm actually looking at  and just saw wrong for a second, because it always amuses me how silly it looks then. But then there's an actual horse. I'm know that it actually was a trick on the eyes, probably a combination of my reflection and some of the shit behind me, but then my brain let it all go another step further. We had a weird little stare off. I was trying to figure out what the hell his eyes were, because they weren't mine but they were so black and glossy and real. He actually looked more like a very realistic stuffed toy horse that had come to life. If that makes any sense. I mean, you can imagine it, like in Toy Story.

This isn't as ""weird,"" but it's definitely something. I just realized, if I stare intensely at one of the objects on my desk, which are all just 2 feet or less from my face, after a couple seconds it appears to rise up ever so slowly and then stops about an inch or 2 off my desk. As long as I keep staring at it, it just hovers there, kinda wobbling back and forth ever so slightly. This is actually fucking with my head a lot more than the horse head. But it's probably not that it's the fact my head is exhausted and excreting drugs right now.

 Does it count as a hallucination if I can control it, though? 

luckily I finally got with all my work and that ""wave"" of tiredness just washed over, which means I'll be able to fall asleep soon hopefully.

Oh my god, I looked at my door, which I can see from where I am sitting, and I swear to god it looks like someone is turning the handle around. The more I look at it though, the more it just looks like the handle has a life of its own and is twisting and dancing ever so slightly about. While slowly sliding down the door, like its base is melted.

Ok, I officially understand how meth users get paranoia. I never understood it until this second. For a good 5 seconds I 100% thought someone was about to open my door (I have drugs lying out...which is why my door is LOCKED) and then for another 5 seconds I freaked out because I thought they're just fucking with me...or trying to get the door open. idk. That was terrifying though. Shit now I can see everything moving in my peripheral sight. Bed time.

I swear this wasn't going to be a ramble...just a simple open discussion about people's experiences with hallucinating. But then I just legitimately saw that shit and like I said in my second sentence up at the top. agh

I shot a speedball in one of my normal spots and the blood was kinda dark and as soon as I pushed off it felt like there was a flash of boiling water in my hand.  After the flash I could feel my my thumb and pointer finger swelling the fuck up.  UHHGGGG IT FUCKING KILLED AND THE COKE MADE IT CRAZY SHITTY.

I wrapped the injection spot with a warm compress and kept it above my heart. 45 minutes later it just keeps getting better and better. 

BUT THEN 30 MINUTES LATER I DID A SHOT OF JUST DOPE IN MY OTHER ARM NEAR THE ELBOW.  The blood this time was definitely dark and as soon as I pushed off it didn't feel right.  Instead of the extreme flash of heat like like the last time.  The histamine reaction was way more intense than it should have been.  Slowly I could feel fingers swelling up and my arm getting hot and getting those little white bubble deals all over the arm.  My head also started to get a pulsing headache (it could have been way way wayyy worse) unlike when I hit the artery in my left hand before. 

Everything is feeling almost back to normal 2-ish hours later.  After shooting drugs for for about a year now  I have never ever hit an artery.  And then tonight I do it twice in a row while using completely different spots on different arms.  It was fucking intense and terrible.  

So it's definitely getting better for sure BUT does anyone have any advise on how to not let it happen again? Did I hit the artery the second time because of the first time I hit an artery in the other arm?  The second time the blood was very dark.

I am currently prescribed 120mg of oxycodone daily for slipped anterior discs on both sides of my jaw. My dose is broken up into:
40mg OxyNeo (XR 12hrs) in the morning
50 mg short acting oxy for the day
30 mg OxyNeo around 10 pm

Now Im not a fan of the oxyneo because I don't feel it is as effective for managing my pain but I do appreciate how the long term med keeps the dosing much more consistent in my body.

I suffer from severe IBS and and when I have flair ups I need to take laxatives and all that good stuff and what ends up happening is the oxyneo is not absorbed at all and passes right through me (TMI- literally comes out whole)

Because of this I have gone through my short acting medication already and am left with my oxyneos left for the next two weeks.

Because they last 12 hours but only peak around the 5 hour mark I am unsure as to how I should split up my doses throughout the day to ensure I am able to manage my pain and avoid withdrawal.

My question:** In order to take 120 mg a day of my medication does anyone have any suggestions on how I should break up my doses through out the day. I have 10, 20 and 40 mg tablets.

I'm a regular here but using a new username for a bit to try out.

Anyway I'm a regular oxy user for pain management. I live in western PA. I tried H once back in 2006 by nose but was on a lot of coke so never had a pure experience with it. Anyway I know that out here we get number 4 and I know it is fine to use as is. I recently ordered some number 3 Afghani about 4 grams labeled as about 60% pure and 0.5g 94% pure also #3. I heard this type requires either citric acid or vinegar or some kind of acid to be activated for injection. Is this also true for snorting or will I be able to snort as is? Basically how do I prepare it for that type of usage? Also with oxy I 99% of the time just take it by mouth and my tolerance is about 90 MG to be pain free and feel good and it takes probably 120-150 to make me high properly. My question is 1) how much should I take of h #3 and what if I had no tolerance or minimal just for an idea of how it doses? 2) if I took a dose orally would it do anything and is dosing different? What is preferable between oral or nose?

What I *really* need to do, though, is finally post something god dang it!

So, I am officially posting this, so I can stop writing posts and then deleting them. So now I can get off reddit. Here is the tldr right now: I talk myself in circles by rambling about how I ramble, further demonstrating my current state of mind. 

Long story short, I've been up for almost 2 days on a lot of vyvanse, that I finally stopped taking this morning, but I can definitely still feel it. Anyone who knows me at all, knows I love my meth/vyvanse/adderall/whatever rambling rants, because usually one of those drugs is the required ingredient to be in my system for me to even post on here in the first place. Oh jesus, I'm already rambling. I start using just a few more words than necessary in my sentences...and if I was really smart I'd probably start throwing in some big words I definitely kind of know the meanings of, but wouldn't dare say in public. But I'm not that (kind of) smart, however, I am not dumb and when I start rambling like this I feel so intense, so focused, so ridiculously deep in concentration, I sense that the overall average length of the words I start using is higher. I feel the need to write everything out particularly and as detailed as possible because I need somewhere to focus all this focusing energy haha. 

Ok I am seeing shit out of the corner of my eye, a lot more than usual. I could have sworn now twice for 2-3 second it looks like theres a huge bubble on my pinky, like, a really bad burn type of bubble. I also see clothes moving on my floor and something moving in the crack that my clothes drawer is open. Once, after a 2 day only-meth binge I actually saw the shit you usually only see in the corner of your eye in front of my face! Mostly weird faces that reminded me of A Christmas Carol and blended into the background, so not that vivid. And long grass wherever I walked. That was weird. Thats why I don't do meth by itself kids! Always make sure you have some heroin for when you come down :)

Ok I need to get shit done. I can't keep almost finishing posts (and by finishing, I mean both that I am done with them and they are literally full), only to leave for a few minutes or even just change the tab for a 3 seconds, and come back to realize I can't type more once I've started...I just vomited 10000 characters in one sitting, the only parts of my body moving...my fingers and my jaw, as I pull my inner lip through my teeth over and over again. The swelling in the the lower inside corners of mouth has finally gone down from smoking a bunch of g friday and saturday. Of course, if my friend hadn't noticed me chewing without eating anything and gotten me gum late friday, there would be 2 bloody balloons sticking out into my mouth :D. 

O.M.G. do you see what I mean about going off on tangents? I started that paragraph about how I almost got done with my semi-organized rambles, and ended talking about gum and mouth bleeding -_-. That's nothing compared to my earlier posts, you should have SEEN the state they were in! My english professor would have had a heart attack, haha can't even write a topic sentence for every 3 **sentences**! much less a whole paragraph. 

But here is where I truly take the crown for amphetamine-induced rants: rambling about rambling. In one of my earlier posts, multiple ones actually lol, I just talked and talked for paragraph after paragraph about how I can't shut up! Now I'm doing it again! God its like...rambling meth rant inception. GET ME OUT! lol

Ok, here is what I was going to say originally, because, idk if you've figured this out yet, but every post I make has to have some sort of ""point."" Now this point may or may not actually exist. Maybe at one point (lol) it did but I forgot it. It doesn't matter, the important part of the ""point"" is that I always fail to make it. Here I am, failing right now! Something always needs explaining when you're on vyvanse. 

Yeah fuck it, I'm just going to keep rambling. The harder I try not to, the more I do. I feel like in those nightmares (I used to get them, at least) where you can't run. But you just keep trying and trying...and your legs are moving but you're not going anywhere! But you know that you know how to run...you remember doing it a bajillion times before. That's me...but instead of trying to run, I'm trying to shut up. Haha

Now we'll never know, did I ever have a point to make? Did I ever really, if it never got made, even if I thought I did at some point?

If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? If I claim I have a specific point to make, but I never get around to it and you never find out what it is, was there still a point to this post?",1413507793.0

the cop was real good with me. he kept it hidden inside the police van while he sifted through it to make sure i had no heroin in there (a friend was walking me home and i was going to score when i got back.. lucky) and the friend that was with me was asked to leave and didn't hear anything about the foils/bags. 

the police took me in the van to the hospital to speak to the psychiatrist and told me they wouldnt mention it to them. they also called my mom to come and get me from hospital and didn't mention it to her either.

i'm out a couple hours later and have managed to score. started to feel a bit sick towards the end of the hospital visit because we were waiting for hours but luckily just as the WDs were creeping in i had a short meeting with the doctor and was allowed to leave.

basically just wanted to tell a story of cops being bros with me. for the amount of old foils with streaks of heroin on and old bags with heroin residue and a crack pipe full of old ash from crack they could have easily kept me in a police cell for the night and charged me with something.

i am infitely grateful that they didn't and can't believe my luck that i'm free tonight and smoking some sweet brown.

My background: I have been using mainly only kratom. The first half of year of usage was just perfect. 5-6 hours of amazing feeling and productive time with relatively small doses. 

(Definition of a good feeling: something I've never felt before, something that cleared my head for the first time and allowed me to feel how I was meant to feel. I could just go and enjoy studying, improving my life, having conversations that mean something etc.)

Then, after a year (fast forward to now) it turned to a year of daily use where a good feeling, if it comes, last 15 minutes tops. I usually use it just because to feel okay or just because I just do it(?). If I don't use, I lose all my energy, functionality and mental capability to perform for first few days without it. Then I try to convince my self that it is just how 'normal' people feel (i.e. shitty) but after a week of WD's I feel actually ok. Which means I have energy, sort of, but feel ultimately depressed. About 70% of time I just think of just getting more and I idealize the feeling I previously had. I always believe I will feel like the first time but I never do. However, if I have it my system, at least, I can stop thinking of it and continue with my other responsibilities. 

Also, I have tried for few times various dosages of codeine - from 50 mg to 250 mg. No matter what codeine dosage it was, it gave me the same results - it did not provide me any buzz but allowed me to forget 'kratom buzz' for few hours and gave me a little bit of sloppy feeling which is ok. 
Whenever I'm running out of kratom, I try not to order. Then after a week without it, I end up simply ordering it and just waiting my parcel to arrive i.e. checking my email, tracking my parcel every 30 minutes every day since I placed the order. It happened at least 10 times already. 

So, my question is, should I be afraid of this kind of addiction? Because once I have my kratom I'm ok. I don't get high any more. I perform quite well in what I do and I constantly go towards a very well-paid (and most importantly interesting) career. 

Any response is appreciated.

But when I get painkillers for something, I take them til they are gone.  I don't get them anywhere else.  They are just gone, and that's that.

Every now and then I think (twisted, I know), you know, if I went to the ER would they give me dilaudid if I presented with the same symptoms? I know they look for gall stones as well. 

Does this sound ridiculous?  Since I have had it before, and I have NEVER been back to the ER, I can't see them labeling me as a drug seeker.  And I'd get some blood work done to boot, which I would like to have.

I'm not really sure how I feel right now...so I'm not really sure how to describe the dope. Basically, it makes me nod really hard, but at the same time, I don't feel that high. And that's the **tldr** right there, since I ended up posting a long one again lol. Anyways, usually by the time I am nodding so uncontrollably and so hard my heads hitting my desk, I am not in the mental state to even analyze what I'm thinking or how I'm feeling in the first place. The farthest I get is ""dude I'm really high."" 

I kind of want to say this dope is shitty...but it isn't, exactly. At least, when I think of shitty dope I think of dope that I've had to smoke/snort a lot more of than usual to get high. Or dope that gets me ""high,"" technically, but ruins it by making me feel like shit at the same time, usually with a headache, nausea and/or puking, no matter how much I do (I don't normally puke). The latter has only happened with 2 different dopes (what do you call them? strains? types?).

But this falls into neither of those categories. Actually, my guy said it was some fire. He doesn't make that much selling h, he just does it on the side to help out a couple friends, so I don't think he's ""lying."" I know it's unusual, but he only shoots every once and awhile, and I could see it being a lot different shot up. It gives me such an intense nod, I could imagine the bangin rush being very intense.

I really wish I had some g, but I can't find the last shit I got and didn't even touch yet that I swear is somewhere in my room! My room is a mess, but I have no motivation to clean it and find my drugs while I'm nodding like this. One of the many reasons I love to do g with h (;P) is how it can stop my head from hitting my desk every 30 seconds, and I'm very curious how it would interact with the ""high"" this shit is giving me. I really have no idea what would happen.

The last thought I have on this: maybe my state of mind could be affecting how the dope affects me? if you read my post from last night, you know I ended up staying up for over 40 hours, and for the first 38 of those hours I was working/studying for school literally nonstop (not counting breaks to refill my water bottle or pee) and under a ridiculous amount of stress. Like, panicking the entire time. And of course the whole time I was doing a ridiculous amount of stimulants. Anyways, I ended up hallucinating the most vividly I ever have and getting pretty paranoid and freaked out. I did fall asleep finally, thank god, and didn't wake up until 7 in the evening, 10 hours ago. So I don't know if any of that could play a part in this.

So yeah, that's where I'm at right now...and have been at for the past 8 or 9 hours. I'm at...trying to figure out where I'm at. Anyone have any insight? Can relate to anything I just wrote? Ever had dope anything like this? ",1413640819.0

I'm sitting here trying really hard to remember, but I think stimulants reverse the effect. At first I was thinking shooting reverses the effect, but then I realized almost every time almost every single one of my shots has either been a speedball or a goofball (meth and h). I can't remember if I got hiccups the last time I shot straight h, because it was like, a year ago. I was probably too high at the time to even notice if I did. But yeah, I really noticed the hiccuping this summer, when I didn't have any coke or g. I just did h every day, and I ended up hiccuping a lot! I'm also writing this post right now, because I just got the hiccups and I had forgotten about them, as I haven't gotten them in a while...juuust like I haven't done h by its lonesome in a while either! So my bets on stimulants.

One things for sure, though. When I snort or smoke h by itself, I way too often get the hiccups. It's never right away, though, but often after I've been getting high for a couple hours. I started smoking 7 hours ago tonight, for example. 

Sometimes they do come on in the first hour or so, just never right away. I remember this summer I'd get high at home, and then be scared my mom would know just because I had the hiccups. I have no idea if she knew the connection, because it doesn't really make any sense, but I was still worried she'd suspect...no normal person gets the hiccups every fucking day.

Can anyone relate to my plight? I think I might have actually posted about hiccups at some point, but if so, it was probably a while ago and I don't remember. I googled heroin hiccups, though, and the first result was a reddit post so I know I'm not alone. I mean, I didn't *actually* think I was the only one who got the HH (lol), I just wanted to hear your personal experience with them.

If you do, let's all experiment and see if I'm right about the stimulants! Do some meth!...do it for me? Coke'll do too, I *guess*. Maybe the stimulant theory is a known fact; I can't find any scientific explanation online for the heroin hiccups though. Either way...still do meth. 

I'm actually curious, do all opiates cause hiccups? Do some more than others? Does ROA have any effect? Is the first captcha always a lot harder than the second one, or is it just me? DAE consistently fuck up the first time but nail it the second? (I am not even kidding, it just happened again)",1413632795.0

Then snorting began to be less euphoric. My friend who shoots tossed the idea about trying that. It's funny how an idea which what repulsed you can quickly be forgotten once that plunger is pushed all the way down. Euphoria becomes the carrot on the stick. Constantly chasing that which can take everything away becomes rationalized easily. About a month into doing this 4-5 days a week lead to today. 

Friday morning after 10 hours of sleep I woke up more drained than what I thought was possibly. Merely standing, much less working, was agony. I counted the hours till I can go score.

It's probably not exactly what you think.","I'm sure this has been posted a lot, and I would just try to google it, but I'm kind of freaking out. My wife and I have been on suboxone for about 2 years. My wife just had some pelvic surgery and her appendix removed, and it had to be done quickly. So, there was no weening off of suboxone or anything to get ready to take the painkillers. The surgery was last night, and she's been trying to fend off the pain with high-dose IB profen and Teylonal, but it became too much for her and she took 40mgs of oxycodone. Now, we don't even think it will do anything, but the doctor insists. What do you guys think we should do? At this point, she is not worried about relapse. She has had the opportunity a few times and had no problem shaking it off. So, should she try to keep off the suboxone? That could take like 3 days right? And at this point, since she took the oxycodone out of desperation, how long will she have to wait before she can take the suboxone again if she wanted to? Any advice in general would be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry if this has been asked a million times, and if i seem incoherent this has all just been a bit much. *",1413603680.0

When we snort H the normal way,  like Cocaine,  a very big part of it ends up dripping down through our throat and goes right in the stomach.  The problem with that it's efficiency is around 10%.
Now here is the method.  Buy,  or get at food stores the straws that are bendy.  (like this http://www.directimportsuk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/striped-8-inch-bendy-6mm.jpg) 

1. 
    1..  Cut off the long part so the length of it equals about twice the size of the small part. 
    2. . Bend it to make it L shape.  
    3. . place the powder dose in the straw,  it works best if it lands in the middle at bendy part.  Make sure straw is 100% dry every time.  
    4. Now,  inhale some air and hold your breath.  Very important to HOLD YOUR BREATH UNTIL DONE AT THIS POINT. 
    5. Place the long end in your nostril. 
    6. Place the short end in your mouth. 
    7.  Blow into the straw. 
**Now when you will blow into the straw,  your throat /nose connection will Close! Resulting in everything that you just blew up your nose to stay in the right place and not lose ANY OF IT.**
Edit:layout 
By doing that ENTIRE powder ends up in nostrils instead of your stomach!  Also this helps prevent asthma and lung infection,  both of which are too regular of a problem for snorties. 

Hope my explanation was good enough.  If something doesn't make sense comment me.  If it's extremely confusing I'll make a photo or video tutorial. 

Peace,  and now go

it was fuuuuucked up. He's usually super reliable, fast (like 90% of the time I call and he's there literally within 5 minutes) and will deliver reasonable distances on his bike as long as the weather is okay, but today was a joke.

I got to the spot about midday, called and he showed up 5 minutes later saying he was out and had to go reload so I should walk further up in the direction he was headed and wait by the canalside for him, should take 20 mins.

I get there, sit down and figure ""fuck it, I have reading to do for school I'll get on with that as I wait""

hour and ten later (I was so absorbed in the book I didnt realise how late it was) he comes by saying his delivery hadn't shown, was probably gonna be another 30, I can either wait or call back later, so I wait.

half hour goes by, calls to say nothing, I say I'll wait. Happens again. 
Now it's pushing 4 so all told I've sunk like 4 hours into sitting around so I say ""fuck it imma go home, text me when your delivery shows up.""

By 7 I've been home a few hours, ate, done some work, watched some 30 Rock, anything to pass the time and keep me from going crazy, and still nothing so I call and he says ""yeah my man's finally showed up and I'm on my way there, set off and by the time you get here I'll be live.""

So I do.
And I get there in a half hour and call. No answer. Three times.
I'm ust about to call it all off and go to bed and he rides by and goes ""sorted, gotta go home and bag it up, take a slow walk down after me and by the time you get to the spot I'll be ready"".

So I do.
Another 15 minute wait and finally he shows up, just after 8pm (I initially called him at almost bang on midday)

And the thing is, I'm not even particularly pissed off about it. He did come through *eventually*, I had nothing better to do all day, it forced me to do some work I otherwise would probably have procrastinated on and (this is probably the key tbh) he's my only hookup so my options were basically wait or do another shitty codeine CWE that mostly just makes me feel right on the verge of puking all day cause the taste is *so* unbelievably vile.

So, yeah, that happened.

BY EDGAR ALLAN POE

From childhood’s hour I have not been

As others were—I have not seen

As others saw—I could not bring

My passions from a common spring—

From the same source I have not taken

My sorrow—I could not awaken

My heart to joy at the same tone—

And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—

Then—in my childhood—in the dawn

Of a most stormy life—was drawn

From ev’ry depth of good and ill

The mystery which binds me still—

From the torrent, or the fountain—

From the red cliff of the mountain—

From the sun that ’round me roll’d

In its autumn tint of gold—

From the lightning in the sky

As it pass’d me flying by—

From the thunder, and the storm—

And the cloud that took the form

(When the rest of Heaven was blue)

Of a demon in my view—

I don't usually ask for help around here but I was hoping you guys could help me out with maximising the combination of a few pharms that have come across my lap. I've acquired 100mg valium, 80mg nitrazepam, 80mg OP oxycodone, 20mg OG oxycodone and a 25mg seroquel. I've already taken 60mg OP oxy and 10mg valium orally at 10am and im feeling very very chill atm. I love mixing cones with opiates so I've pounded down a few of those bad boys as well. My current tolerance to opiates is pretty low but I've still got that long term tolerance that will probably never go away. Usually if I'm just doing OP oxy, I'll take up to about 100mg orally and that'll keep me high for around 9 hours give or take. 


Anyway, I was wondering what you guys think is the best way to ingest the rest of my stash.  Its currently 1pm so it's been 3 hours since the first doses and I was thinking of ingesting the last 20mg OP oxy and another 5mg valium at about 2pm. While I wait for the oxy/val to kick in  I'll prep up the last 20mg of OG oxy and IV that at about 3pm. This is what the dosages are so far and what I plan to ingest.


> 10am - 40mg oral OP oxy, 5mg oral valium, 1 bong of middies.


> 11am - 20mg oral OP oxy, 5mg oral valium, 2 cones of topshelf.


> 2pm - 20mg oral OP oxy, 5mg valium


> 3pm - 20mg IV oxy


> >3pm - what do you reckon I should take? More valium? Maybe try a few of the nitrazepams? I just want to get as fucked up as possible today as I won't be able to do this again for a while. I want to stay as safe as possible though. I have no intentions of taking the seroquel and I'm going to save that for a time when I need to be knocked the fuck out.



Does anyone have any experience mixing nitrazepam with oxy and valium? Or even just nitrazepam in its own? I know how dangerous it can be to mix opiates and benzos but I have been mixing them the past few days so I've got a bit of a tolerance to them atm. I've also abused the hell out of them in the past so I do have a slight long term tolerance. I'm also not alone so worse case scenerio someone is here to call an ambulance. 



I've never taken nitrazepam before so I rly don't know what to expect from it. Obviously, it will potentiate the oxy and valium but I don't want to take them off they'll just make me drowsy and kill the euphoria. I might just sick with the oxy and valium and maybe pop one later when I'm coming down. So what do you guys think? Should I take 5mg at 2pm instead of another valium or? 



I know it's extremely difficult for you guys to tell me what dosages are safe considering there are so many different variables but I was just looking for some general advice to get the most out of my drugs. For example, if you've tried nitrazepam with oxy before but you found the combo didn't work then I'd love to hear about that. Or if you think it would be better do the IV oxy and oral oxy earlier than what I was planning. Basically, any info you can give about the substances in question. Time is of the essence so fast replies will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.



Tldr need advice about how I should ingest my droogs for the rest of the day. Any info about nitrazepam would be great and bonus points if you've mixed it with oxy and valium. Any advice about how much and when I should dose to maximise efficiency are also welcomed. Have been mixing oxy and valium past couple days albeit not very efficiently. Also have longterm tolerance to both opiates and benzos. 





Edit - well apparently a lot of people got butthurt about me asking for a bit of advice. Those moral crusaders thought it would be better to lecture me rather than adding anything to the convo. I know some people were only looking out for my well being and I do appreciate that very much but I was merely only asking for some info about how well the substances mixed together at which dosages, roughly estimated of course.



I think there were only two people who offered advice which wasn't something along the lines of ""your going to die"" or ""your an idiot"". Again, I'm puzzled as to why you guys are so fearful to the point where you deem it more important above anything else. Yes I can understand that a situation can be interpreted very differently on the Internet but I tried to be as diplomatic as possible and explain the situation to the best of my ability. I also understand that the large stash amounts listed at the beginning may have threw people off but I explained how much I was planning to ingest thoroughly in my original post.



I ended up following through with what I posted and I threw another 20mg oxy in the mix a bit later on. My cns was definitely somewhat depressed but not to the point of concern and I caught a nice nod later on in the evening while watching a doco.



Id sobered up a lot by the time I hit the hay but after I put on a movie I quickly drifted off into a lovely slumber.  Slept for a good 8 hours and woke up with a nice after glow no doubt due to the Valium still lingering in my system. Cooked up a wicked brekky and now I'm currently getting my daily dose of the internet. 



Anyway, enough rambling you guys probably don't give a fuck about how my night went. I guess I should thank you guys for your concern as you were only looking out for my well being but a majority of the replies were merely stating the obvious and werent very helpful at all. Yes I realise that there is a fine line between having a nice nod and falling asleep to never wake up again. I'm fully aware that it can be fatal, I'm not trying to say it's not but the thing is I'm going to do it anyway while trying to reduce the risks as much as possible. I'm not taking heroic doses or even abnormally high doses of either substance and that doesn't mean I automatically have a deathwish.



Yes you may have an argument if I was ingesting double my normal doses but over the course of the day I ingested my normal oxy dose and 20mg Valium. I acknowledge the longevity of both substances but I was with someone the whole day and kept an eye on my breathing. 


Anyway, this thread is probably going to die off but I still have the nitrazepam so if anyone has any experience with it they're welcome to post.",1413689559.0

I remember cutting oxy 80s into quarters and getting so nauseated every time I used. My boyfriend (now ex) introduced me to opiates and mooched off of me for 4 years. It wasn't all bad though; I probably wouldn't have survived without him being there to teach me how to. I switched to heroin as soon as he was ready to and overdid the heroin, puking every time for the first several months. I always tried to keep up with him, but I only succeeded in causing my tolerance to skyrocket. I am surprised that I never overdosed despite how incredibly dumb and ignorant I was (and still am). 

I went back to a methadone clinic a little bit ago hoping to detox. They told me my health insurance will only pay for maintenance and if I actually wanted to detox I would have to pay cash. So I'm stuck on methadone maintenance. I have no idea how much methadone I am taking because it is a guessing game. I take a tiny sip, trying to drink no more than 1/8th of my 30mg dose and then hiding the rest in my mouth to spit out outside.

Anyway, this clinic is really wearing me down. I'm on a low dose of methadone. Is it possible for me to go back to using pills? What kind of pills would work at my tolerance and at what dosage? I don't IV anymore. I'll plug, smoke, or ingest. I would guess that I am taking approximately 5mg of methadone/daily right now.

The 30 milligram ones were a gorgeous plum. I remember using sewing scissors my Grandmother gave me, exclusively to take the top layer of the pill off so it would dissolve faster. 

At the height of my relationship with MS I was easily taking 120 milligrams a day. I was a freshmen/sophomore during that time. That didn't include the fifth of vodka a day, or the few grams of weed a day I smoked. It doesn't include all the other pills I would devour. I didn't eat so the pills would dissolve quickly. My favorite after school snack was an ice cold Coke and 30 milligrams. 

April of my Sophomore year of high school I got completely cut off. I asked my supplier for more and I was handed a hydrocodone 5 milligram and told that was it.  

I'd had a brief four day withdrawal period months before and had done awful things in order not to be dope sick. I didn't even have that option this time. The full horror of it hit me.  

It was months before I felt human. I got a doctor to prescribe the shittiest of opiates for the severe chronic pain I had. If I take four of them with my anxiety medication I guess I feel okay. It's better than nothing.

So the other day I split a 100mg MS Contin. I peel off the coating, crush the whole shit up and give it on a spoon with NaCl.

Shit does not dissolve at all and it all gets a gooey, waxy shit. I took a cigarette filter, dropped it on the spoon, have no idea how to draw it up the syringe properly (Keep in mind, I'm fucking retarded and did no fucking research on this, and have never IV'd before. It was all impulsive). I try to draw the solution with the needle up the syringe. Somehow it does not work very well and there are lots of air bubbles in the syringe.

You know what I did fucking next? 

Just stang the needle in the vein in my left arm and pushed down the plunger, it was all about 3ml. Didn't feel anything. What the fuck, there's no rush, no high... Suddenly it fucking BURNED SO FUCKING BAD OH MY GOD IT BURNED REALLY HORRIBLY FUCKING BAD AND MY ARM WAS SHAKING UNCONTROLLABLY CALLED AN AMBULANCE GOT DELIVERED TO THE HOSPITAL --> Result: Collapsed vein and big fucking abcess. 

You know what I did with the other half the next day. Shoved it up my ass.

After a while though we both began taking pills recreationally (4-5 times a month). Then my GF and I moved to NYC where we both found work and I had forgotten all about pills; until one day when I decided to pick up a few pills to celebrate my brother's birthday. When she found them she at first didnt say anything in fact we had a great weekend together and she seemed to be having fun. Then once we got back to the apartment she asked what I was doing with the pills. I lied, told her I wasn't taking them that I got them for a friend who was trading me for cannabis (which we both partake. I love my girl friend more then anything in the world and I don't want to loose her. I know I fucked up and I would do anything to gain her trust back.

Well, I've been 'clean' for the past few months and doing really well. I was shooting about a gram a day, got on subs for about a month, and now I'm 'clean'. But when I say I'm clean, I mean that I am no longer looking to get high, and nod out. But god, do I fucking miss it. 

I take 2 10mg norco/day due to my Crohns diease. I know my body isn't completely rid of all opiates, but to me, I feel clean. I don't get a buzz from 20mg of hydrocodone, lol. And recently got a blood workup done to see how my Crohns is doing, and how my other medicine is effecting me. I also am I diabetic. I need insulin. 

I went to my local pharmacy the other day, went to the pharm tech, asked him for 100ct of 30g insulin needles. He saw 1 track mark on my left arm, middle of my elbow vein, and I quote 

***""Sorry, here at Walgreens, we don't like to support junkies getting high.""***

What in the **fuck**?

I said I just got blood taken, and I'm a diabetic. I need insulin and just ran out of needles. 

He laughed. Said get out of here kid. 

I'm 27, not really a kid, but not really 'old'.

So I go on over across the street to CVS, and the lady at the pharm stared at my arm, and just walked away. At this point, I am filled with anger. Finally, I put a long sleeve shirt on, and go to Walmart. *I fucking hate WalMart.*

I get my needles. And that is that. 

This entire experience made me realize the ugly stigma against people who use. What makes me even more sad, is that someone wanting to use clean needles, wouldn't be able to access them if this happened to them. 

Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? If you have, fuck, I am sorry. 

And is everyone enjoying their Sunday? I hope so. I miss nodding out on chill ass sundays. :(

Remember when you like to skate? draw? play guitar? sports? that all came second once we start to use, eventually you don't do anything you liked to before you started using you just use. man that is depressing, for those who arent finished please continue to use, because a wise man told me to stop but i am stubborn and have to ""see it to believe it"" so once i got jailed lost 3 good friends and have 3 felnoies, you bet your ass i believe it. for those who are serious about wanting to quit please message me , i might save a life from pain. ill end on this, once you hit termoil is when you change, when the lifestyle of active addiction becomes more great than to just stop using you stop using, why go to the bottom to realize its a one way road, take my story as a means of not wanting this shit. moments of pleasure, for a lifetime of pain. take your pick.

The first time I used, when I was 17, I stole 3 5/500 Vicodins from my parents cabinet. I took one...two.....three. Then I waited. I layed down as I already felt nauseuos (I used to be really bad at taking pills, and I had an empty stomach). I put on Radiohead, the album OK Computer. By the time ""Let Down"" came on, I started to reeeeeallly feel it, coming in waves of euphoria. My nauseua passed in I layed in my bed and just smiled and passed out. I woke up to ""Electroengineering"" and drifted in and out. By the time I was finished ""OK Computer"", I was still really high so I put on Kid A. I had a equally good experience with that. After that came to an end, I got up, still faded and snuck into my moms room and stole another 2.5mg (one was already broken in half). I swallowed it and proceeded to go take a shower and blaze. It took forever to pack that bowl but as soon as I packed it, I hit it up. The weed really put me in a daze. I eventually got out of the shower. It was like 7:45 and the California end of summer sun was setting. I went outside and started to vape and watch the sunset. By the time it was dark, I started to come down. I drifted off to sleep with such ease and woke up still in bliss. I ended up smoking another bowl in the morning. I decided against taking more pills because I couldn't become an addict (lol). I went downstairs, with no one up and then I saw it: codeine w/ promethazine. A bottle nearly full. I proceeded to chug a good mouthful or two and began to feel that warm bliss.

Hope all is well. I just wanna share a story with you guys about something marvelous that has happened. It all starts a little bit ago, when I first started doing H. I live in a relatively small town that actually has quite an abundance of dope, when it's around. When it dries up however, that means that the main people that supply to place are out of town picking up again, or are just plain out. There's only a handful of people that supply this place, I could probably count them all on both hands. My first connect was a small time dealer, who was pretty good business wise but sometimes took forever or just didn't even answer. One day, I'm over at his place and HIS connect finds out I'm an IT Technician, so she asks me to burn her some DVDs and some music CDs. I said no problem, made the CDs and GOT HER NUMBER! Woot. So when I dropped the media off, I casually asked her if she had any black to sell me and of course the answer was yes, so *boom* brand new connect that's an actual connect. Moving on, I end up being the driver for her for awhile, taking her to a certain town in West Texas so she can pick up. Every time we got back to our hometown, she would throw 2.5g on the scale and give it to me as payment for the ride. I was livin' large at that point in time. Fast forward to January of this year, and I end up going to Treatment (rehab) and either lost her number or clean me must have deleted it since I thought not having numbers would keep me clean or something (lol). I relapse after being about 2 1/2 months clean, and end up moving back home. The connect was still doing good, but unfortunately I couldn't get in contact with her to score from her. I was really sad, cause I would take people to her place and ask them to ask her if I could get the greenlight and her new phone number so I could resume business as usual. Lo and behold the people middle-manning for me ""forget"" to ask her for me, so I end up having to go through someone to get to her even though she was once **MY CONNECT**. Today, I take someone over there and we have to take her to her stash spot! So, once we get the stuff I tell her I've been trying to get her new number and all that. She says, ""You know I'll always sell to you opithrowaway666, here's my number."" I was waaay fuckin' excited to have my old connect back! BTH is $20 per point where I live, but this lady always gives about .15 or .20 for $20 cause she fucks with cartel and has it like that. I actually just got back from her house and shiiit I thought I was gonna fall out cause the amount I've been doing has been small, cause people like to bullshit around this place, or simply take some of your order off the top for themselves. I'm so happy I have this connect back in my phonebook, I can rest easy knowing I can take of myself now instead of calling some whack ass middle man.

 Earlier today I saw a picture online from a friend who just bought herself and her little boy a pair of matching shoes. I mentioned how my son loves wearing matching shoes with me too, and told her about how we used to have matching converse. Then I remembered it had been a while since we've done that, he's wearing Walmart shoes for now.

  When I looked at the cash in my hand all I could think about was how I could turn around now and go spend that on some matching shoes to surprise my boy with. But of course, I wouldn't. It's not that he's being denied what he needs, he's got shoes, he's got clothes, he's got food. But things could be brighter and I could do better by him if I didn't have to blow money like this. It made me feel like a piece of fucking trash looking at each of those 20s, each of which my kid would consider a fortune.

They have been going around in Canada. They're a solid dark blue with a slight green tinge. The OC and 80 markings are the same as the original and not off center or uneven in any way as far as I can tell. They're very hard and don't have a coating. They have to be cut before crushing because they're so hard. They retain their color when crushed. My source has them and told me himself they contain fentanyl. I get other stuff from him and it's all great quality. I know a few people who use them regularly (some choose them over other oxys) and think they're great but I couldn't find them online ANYWHERE. Most of the fakes in Canada say CDN instead of OC because our legit script ones do, but these are the American OC on one side and 80 on the other. I couldn't find a single news article, photo, forum post, etc mentioning fakes with OC stamped on them. They ALL say the ones they're referring to are stamped CDN. Because of my source's transparency on them being fake, his record of having good stuff, and other people's opinions, I'm inclined to believe the quality is fairly good, but I'm kind of alarmed by finding no information at all.

I've taken them a few times as a complete naive and gotten a very good high off one quarter of one (I know that much was risky for my first time). Half makes me nod like crazy. I usually swallowed half my dose and snorted half. I know the bioavailability of fentanyl is much higher insufflated than eaten. The times I swallowed them the high was still very good. I didn't notice much difference but I don't think I have enough experience to really know. My questions are, should I be snorting my whole dose? I usually want a longer high so I'm thinking swallowing might be fine. Will the fent make my tolerance to other opiods skyrocket? Am taking a big risk of overdosing by taking these?

The only test's that have shown any abnormalities have been an MRI of my lumbar spine, and another MRI of my thoracic spine. Which showed that I have herniated and torn disc causing sciatica in my lumbar spine, and foraminal stenosis in my thoracic spine along with mild arthritis and a protruding disc. So I've done everything my pain specialist doctor has told me to do, which has included two RFA (rhizotomy) procedures in my thoracic spine area and I'm still in pain.
 


So far I've been on the following medication which has done nothing for me pain wise: 

 - Hydrocodone 5/325 (For about 3 months before the RFA procedure, and a month after the first RFA)

 - OxyCodone 5mg - (For about 2 months after the first RFA procedure where I complained the pain was so bad he bumped me from Hydro to Oxy) I also itch REALLY bad on this and I hate it, but why?

 - Dilaudid 4mg - (had saved from past surgery a year ago, didn't help for pain)

Plugging is my main ROA. I made this little guide to help y'all out!



Step one: Obtain drugs and do happy dance. 

Step two: Poop. If you can't, oh well, but at least try. Use an enema. They work wonders. If you don't have an enema, draw some water into your oral syringe and plug that WITHOUT THE DRUGS. Do this until you have 10-15ml of water inside you. Then do jumping jacks for a minute or so. After that, go to the bathroom and push the water out. This should help clear you out a little bit. 

Step three: Break your drugs down as finely as you can. The finer the better. 

Step four: Mix them with a little water. I'd recommend about 4-5ml. I use a shot glass to mix. With Morphine IR, I just drop it in 1ml of water and it dissolves within a few seconds with a little stirring. With blues, I'll usually break them down most of the way, then drop them and stir. (Unless I have M boxes. They dissolve pretty easily with some stirring. I've found that putting them in the back of the oral syringe and drawing it up half way with water and shaking works best. Make sure that once you have it half full, you draw it back the rest of the way to half it half water and half air. Now just shake it until the blue is all dissolved.)

Step five: Get your oral syringe. Dip it in the drug water and pull the plunger back. I usually bring it back about another mL to get some air in after it's all in there, just so I can shake it up to make sure it has all dissolved well. 

Step six: Apply lube, spit, Vaseline, whatever to your syringe and bootyhole. 

Step seven: Lay on your left side for best absorption. I like to get a few pillows, stack them up, and put them under my ass and lie on my left a little. This way the drugs are guided up and in. 

Step eight: Insert your oral syringe all the way (or at least halfway if it's uncomfortable.), then press down on the plunger. And remove. You can get up immediately or keep lying there for a few minutes to let it absorb better. Doesn't matter all that much. And there you go. 

I usually get another 2ml in my oral syringe and then drip it down the sides of my shot glass to get anything I missed, then plug that.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to comment. This is a great ROA and I hope more people take advantage of that. ",1413940915.0

I'm working on a documentary about heroin in the state of Arizona and how it's a growing epidemic for the community. Heroin use has been growing and growing and it's now reached the level where it's out in the open.  

I'm looking for recovering heroin users, those who survived an overdosed, or family members/partners affected by loved ones who have used or are currently using. 

I figured this forum may help get the word out. If you know anyone in Arizona (not necessarily Phoenix, it could be any city in the state) who have had issues with heroin and would be willing to talk about their journey on camera for a documentary that is airing statewide in January across Arizona, please contact me. We've talked to different local agencies, fire departments, hospitals, etc but what we're missing is the most important voice and that's of the people directly connected to it. 

It's a sensitive issue, but such an important one. Heroin is affecting every corner of this state, and our purpose is to tell these people's stories so that others who are thinking of starting don't. 

Thanks!",1413910134.0

I am currently writing an Epidemic-Addiction series which many of you have visited and a few of you are reading and now following me on Facebook (thank you)

The thing is I need good images for my blog posts. Google images are fake and i really lived this shit and want the images to tell a story and relate to heroin/meth addiction. I don't want butt plungers filled with water in my pics, I want the real fucking deal. I have grabbed some from imgur that are real but they are difficult to find, if any of them belong to people in this sub..thank you..let me know and I will gift you gold.

Also because I have over a year clean now, I don't want to spend hours searching through images, I am strong and they don't trigger me but I just don't want to focus on them as much.

I was a junkie, so I really need good images of needles (rigs), cottons, spoons, track marks ( I am female and have no female images, only guys seem to take pics of banging) I would take those too. Pictures of tar, meth, meth clouds, heroin tracks on foil (I started with smoking heroin so need them for story) A picture of an arm being tied off would be nice. If anyone hits their neck, a pic of that would be appreciated, as that was what I had to resort to when my veins were shot in the end..

I would love images that do not have faces in them and prefer images  that center the tar or rig etc.. in the image. I know I can pay for images but even those look like an after school special and I really need the images to be raw, as my story and the way I am telling it most certainly is.

I am willing to gift Reddit Gold to Redditors who give me great images. I don't know if any of you care about Reddit Gold, I just know that I can at least do that to show appreciation. I am not asking to own the rights to the pics and I realize once they are online it is free game to save images to computer and use them, I would just rather show any of you who's image I use, respect. 

I hate even asking for these pics, as I wish all of you the best on a road to recovery...but I can see by the thread many of you are active users that post pill porn pics...so I thought it couldn't hurt to ask.. Thank you for your attention..send me a message if you can help.",1414061374.0

I shoot out of bed, heart pounding, slightly sweaty ready to fight the wisps of an intruder.. there are none, where have these voices come from?

I have a habit right now of about a bundle a day of decent ecp, I've been snorting pretty much everyday for 9 months and in the last month or so have started IVing in order to conserve, but unfortunately even if I IV I end up using 7-10 bags a day and if I snort I can easily go through two bundles and it's just unsustainable. 

A couple days ago I tried to quit using subs. I waited until I was in withdrawals which usually present in me with extreme restlessness, watery eyes, yawning, depression, and anxiety, I don't get nauseous or any pain or anything but that may be that I just have never let it get that far. But when I tried to quit I started off with like half of an 8mg sub strip and then waited as the restless legs continued to get worse and worse. Honestly the restlessness was so fucking bad that I was in agony. I never realized how fucking awful rls could be, I couldn't sit still, Couldn't get relief, nothing would work, not the sub, not a hot shower, even constantly walking around brought very limited relief, it was honestly TORTURE. I couldn't bear being awake and falling asleep was out of the question. I kept taking more subs every half hour or so desperately trying to get relief. I'd say I ended up taking 20mg of suboxone over maybe three hours and I didn't get relief until probably four straight hours after the last dose. I'm just really confused because before I've used subs for this and I've NEVER gotten withdrawals that bad or that long after taking sub and I've never had to take that much before and I'm really freaked out because if subs aren't going to work for me that well then I really don't know wtf I'm gonna do because I don't have the willpower to quit cold turkey and go through the withdrawals because based on what I felt before the subs finally kicked in I was seriously ready to jump off a fucking roof just to stop feeling like that. 

I have two suboxone strips left and I would really like to quit and use them to taper off through the worst of the withdrawals but if my first dose last time was literally more than I have left idk what I should do. I'm thinking maybe I need to slowly taper down my dose of heroin before getting on subs maybe?  ",1414035800.0

I was in a car accident several years ago, and hit at ~50 MPH. My back has atrophied and my left hand has as well. Went from a very active 19 year old girl to a depressed, nearly suicidal bedridden person.

Despite that, doctors were very stringent on helping me manage my pain... I was cut off from Norco after a few months, and then prescribed a stronger version of Aleve. Suffered from an incredible amount of pain. Was diagnosed with a head injury that began to cause an eye movement disorder from the accident impact.


I've been taking over 10+ Tylenols a day just to get by, as well as insane amounts of Advil, Aleve, and Aspirin. 

So this became my alternative. Someone off of CL today managed to help me more than any of the doctors I went to did. I was super naive and scared to use CL, but somehow, it turned out OK and everything went smoothly. Still counting my lucky stars and keeping my fingers crossed that tomorrow the person I contacted will be able to provide me with a refill.

It all happened I think in 2001, I had been sniffing 30mg oxycodone pills like once a week for a while, then i was doing adderall and long story short, after repairing a motorcycle engine I took it out for a test ride and went full retard and crashed on a dirt road. Completely my fault, whatever. Broke my left fore arm (tib-fib compound fracture), got driven to the ER, left surgery with a massive bottle of 15mg oxy's. After that, I was hooked and have been since.

 I've quit for month long intervals several times in the past few years but keep coming back for more. About a year ago I started using heroin. Always the powder stuff, always snorted. Before the heroin, I would smoke weed whenever I did oxy. After trying heroin I never smoke weed. I have a very good job and am looking towards getting a promotion in the very near future. But, I currently work alone 4p-12a and most of the office is gone by then so nobody walks in on me doing lines of dope on my desk all night long. This is soon to change and I will be doing the 9-5.

I'm currently off heroin since Saturday. I put myself basically into a xanx induced coma for all of Sunday, then monday I took like 1/16th of a suboxone strip. I got away with not doing one Tuesday and was fine, but this morning I couldn't get out of bed and took another 1/16th of suboxone, and that's my last dose of it. I don't have a local connect, I rely on the dark web for my supply so I can't really get anything in short term. 
I have tons of xanax and adderall to help. but neither of these cure my severe anxiety and depression. The suboxone helps but I'm out and I don't want to go back on it. 

Can somebody pleaes point me in the right direction? I can barely think straight right now. When people talk to me I feel like I can't formulate sentences. I need advice on what to do.

I'm on norco's 10/325 but ran out and resorted to vicodin 5/500 or vicodin es 7.5/750 for the last 3-5 days. My usual hydro uptake is around 50mg daily or less. Ive been trying CWE for the APAP because its just to hard on my stomach and makes me feel sick. Im not sure I did the CWE correctly and may have exceeded the APAP max daily amount. 

I've been skipping doses because the CWE is a long process and wasn't on time with my doses. Today I experience WD symptoms to the max even though I was taking hydro and even took 5mg of oxy. I had a bit of a pain in the liver area but then again everything was hurting or uncomfortable including the fucking anxiety.

I've researched a bit into liver failures and such and it looks like I'm probably ok. I don't have yellow eyes, or yellow skin. I did have diarrhea but probably from the WD's of not taking my usual doses for the past few days. I didn't throw up or anything. 

My question is the tenderness part of feeling the liver area. I don't know if I may be overthinking it, but I do feel a little tender but at the same time I'm kind of applying a bit of pressure. Can anyone shed any light of maybe their experiences as far as liver concerns go? I will be going to the MD for a check up just in case bright and early but I just want to hear some first hand experiences. Thanks for reading..",1414138847.0

At this point I had done quite a few different things, with weed being the only constant, but had only tried opiates maybe once or twice, never more than maybe one or two Vicodin.

My brother was dating this girl at the time; we'll call her 'Raving Lunatic' to protect her shithouse-rat-crazy identity. The point is, I was 17 and too fucking stoned to ever care. Needless to say, she convinced me one day to help her go through my parents medicine cabinet and try to find ""something good."" What the two of us actually stumbled upon was the tangible notion of happiness itself distilled into a gigantic bottle of cough syrup - Roxicodone, it said. I'll never forget the light in her eyes as she grabbed that bottle and held it up to my view, with the triumphant look of someone who had just struck a diamond vein inside of a gold mine. At first I didn't understand, and just stared blankly at her. I knew she had found her ""something good,"" but I had no idea what the hell that was. ""Do you have any idea what this IS?!"" ""No."" A brief, ill-informed explanation later, and I was sold; not that it was a very hard sell. ""Whatever, sounds good."" The next thing I remember is being down at the neighborhood pool with my best friend, lurking in the picnic area behind the clubhouse while pulling the bottle out of a backpack. We both took a huge gulp, two dumbass teenagers with zero tolerance, of Oxycodone, and the rest of the day fucking. Swam. By. We spent the next hour and a half standing in the shallow end of the pool, lazily throwing a tennis ball back and forth and giggling at each other like fucking imbeciles. It was the most content I had ever been, like the entire day was floating me around on a bed of warm, roiling clouds while I watched things happen from a distance. I don't remember much of the night after that, or whatever we did over the next few days while we slowly finished the bottle, but I'm sure as hell going to always remember what it's like to be fucking lost in space throwing a tennis ball in a pool.

After my very heavy OD I'm nearly 6 weeks clean of H. Check my post history for more details. I still lurk here and live vicariously through you all. Life is good.

So I'm not NA clean *shrugs* as I have done mescaline twice recently. Therefore I still browse certain shady markets. I'm posting here as I noticed a new RC vendor, based in China. Not only are they selling some Fent analogues but also W-15 and W-18, by the gram. Yes W-18 by the gram. If that is not worrying enough they have a clearnet address (don't PM me) and look legit. I've spent enough time in markets to spot a scam. They have full escrow and ratings are positive so far.

This post is a bit of a warning. I'm not niave enough to think these guys are the only ones making and selling what is basically a weapons grade synthetic opiate but they are certainly the first I have seen. If they are legit and some cunts buy a decent amount with bad intentions its not going to be pretty.

I am of course probably being massivly paranoid and over reacting here but please do test shots!

I recently got some MT-45 from an RC site. I found very little online about it, so I thought I'd throw some info to y'all so anyone getting it in the future has something to reference.

I currently have 0 tollerance (I use only every now and then). With 40 mg, I had a nice opiate buzz going on. There's very little euphoria, mostly just a body high. I'm going to try 50 or 55 mgs tomorrow, but so far I haven't been able to catch a nod off of it. It tastes bitter as shit, worse than Xanax or anything else I've ever tasted. I put what was probably .5 mg on my tounge and could taste it for 20 miutes afterward. gelcaps are a must.

I haven't tried snorting as the taste is so bad, and I've read that it burns like hell. Overall, not a bad high for the price. It really needs a euphoric aspect though, that would help its case enourmously.

He's been whipping up pills a lot longer than me but he never really stole from me or did anything that breached my trust. I always trusted him because I helped him out a lot when he was unemployed or hurting. Anyway I get him and we can't find any so I was like fuck it wanna try making poppy seed tea?

Then he send my friend a text saying he got stabbed and some bullshit. I wait for a minute and realized that I just got fucked over. My friend was acting like he was pissed off and didn't believe the guy he got stabbed. So I didn't want to waste anymore time and drove him back to his place and left. Not even 10 mins later my friend calls me telling me that the guy really got stabbed and he's in the hospital etc. etc. I don't understand why he'd do some stupid shit like that because I'd help him if he ever needed anything.

Feeling pretty low and useless about my habit.,"I've been using opiates for over two years now, started IV'ing regularly in June. I want to stop but I can't seem to gain any control over it. I have a job and am lucky enough to work with friends and have a manager who is understanding. I don't have health insurance so I can't get on subs or go to rehab. I only work a few days a week thinking I could use the time off to get clean but I've just been using the excuse of time off to ""relax"" (aka get extra fucking high).

 My boyfriend and I have been escalating our habit, not helping each other at all (he sometimes made it worse because his habit is larger than mine). Now he's in jail for probation violation and I thought maybe since he's in jail I would be able to stop.  I was wrong, all I've been doing is using the same amount of money we'd use to score and just using it all instead of splitting it and just making shit even worse.

Is there someway I can get clean by myself?
I take loperamide to get unsick but it really seems to only work some of the time and it really makes me nauseous most of the time. I liked Kratom but the withdrawals from that in my opinion are worse than dope (reallllllly bad RLS). I could probably hole myself in my room and cold turkey but I don't have that many days off of work in a row. I was thinking about requesting a week off and trying but I'm nervous about the sickness and pain I don't really know the proper way to go about it.

Also I tried to ween myself off but I have no control so I'll get a bun, tell myself to use only one a day then have it be gone the next day. 

I really need some advice and motivation and I feel like y'all would be the best people to ask. Thanks for listening whoever read this. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm feeling really alone and low right now so just talking to anyone would be nice.",1414180208.0

They contain: 5mg ketobemidone and 25mg Dimethylaminodiphenylbuten a piece. 

* Had a Phenergan (25mg) a half hour before indulging.

* ROA: Swallowed one and a half, and insufflated a half when i felt the effects starting.

* An hour later i snorted an other half.

The warmth was good. Only a slight itch. A little noddy/drowsy.

No real euforia, only a moodlift. But maby i can get there?

* Smoked a half joint of some quality hash, and it got me pretty faded, more nodding and knocking a glass teapot on the floor :) (Didn't give a shit, had to clean it up this morning)

* Smoked the other half of the joint.

For some reason i don't really remember much after this, except it felt good.

* Crashed in bed about two hours later.

Now, i want to get the most out of my remaining 2.5 pills, and was wondering if this is suitable for plugging, since they make a 10mg supository, i kinda think it is. Toughts?

As the cops are at my window one says, ""what's up man?"" All my shit was back in my box being thrown into the glove box and locked.

Ive wanted to talk about this for awhile now and figured this is the place.

Ill start with my background and how I came to find ibogaine. I had what I would consider a pretty rough childhood, I wont get too into it but basically emotional abuse and lack of love would best sum that up. This of course colored the rest of my adult life and caused severe anxiety and depression. I self medicated with alcohol, drugs, dysfunctional relationships, you name it, I was textbook. Of course this all made the depression worse such that by the time I hit my 30s I was a complete wreck.

This is about the time I discovered opium, oh heaven and bliss! I finally found my drug! All the pain disappeared, along with everything else. I dove in full force. I shacked up with the man that introduced me to it and we lived together in an opium haze for the last half of my 30s. It was wonderful for awhile, the perfect medicine. But of course it wasn't to last. It took over my life, I felt nothing, no emotion whatsoever, no pain, no anxiety, no care, but also no love, wonderment, excitement, spirituality or anything for that matter. I was dead inside. We both were.

Eventually I realized I had to let the opium go. I was facing severe withdrawl and depression again, it seemed insurmountable. Looking for answers I went online and started researching opium addiction. That's where I discovered ibogaine. I read everything I could find, I became obsessed with it. I had a very strong feeling that I was supposed to find ibogaine, an 'its meant to be' type feeling. This was quite strange because I have always been terrified of hallucinogens, hated mushrooms, bad trips, never tried acid or anything like that. The fact that I was so drawn to ibogaine was so far out of my comfort zone it wasn't even funny. To this day I still believe my opiate addiction was meant to happen just so I could find ibogaine, or for it to find me.

After months of research I found an online source and ordered the powdered bark. I DO NOT recommend this to anyone, I am just telling my story, whether or not it was the smartest plan is not for me to say. It all worked out in the end but again, I am not suggesting anyone follow my path.

Before I took the ibogaine I made sure my partner was there with me, I had informed him on what to expect, that I wouldn't be able to walk properly, I might throw up, diarrhea, etc. He was convinced I was crazy. I on the other hand had ideas of a wonderful, blissful, spiritual experience, boy was I wrong!!! 

Now for the fun stuff, its always so hard to convey a drug experience in words but ill do my best. I hadn't had opium for 24 hrs as recommended so was starting to feel the WD symptoms by the time I took the root bark capsules. Within 20 mins of taking it the WD symptoms were completely gone, I never felt another WD symptom again from that point on, it was remarkable.

For the purpose of saving time i will just try to encapsulate all six trips into one condensed version. It was hell. To say the least. So much hell that everytime i did it i SWORE i would never ever do it again. But of course i did, the outcome is so magical, so beneficial that i would forget the 8 to 12 hrs of hell and 6 months to a year later want to do it again.

Heres my experience, be aware that there is no way for me to truly convey the intensity in words. First i got visions in a sort of waking dream state, like seeing a story visually in my mind, not full on hallucinations, more like an intense daydream. I saw the Earth from space, beautiful, prehistoric, before man. Then man appeared, a tiny blip in North west Africa, the area where the iboga plant is from. As i watched, man began to spread and grow, migrating across the planet, this all was shown to me very quickly, the entire evolution of mankind across the globe up until modern day. This is the point where it went very bad. I saw modern day man in the western world, somewhere USA, and it was ugly, like a cancer. I found myself in a nightclub, music that sounded dark and hypnotic, the energy was incredibly intense, sexual and aggressive. Everyone looked hungry, needy, dark, dead eyes searching for something, sex, attention, something to fill the emptiness, very, very predatory. The women were hyper sexed, fake breasts, wearing very little, very aggressive and competitive. The men were jacked up on steroids, also extremely aggressive and sexual. It was terrifying. I was in this place, these people could see me and I wanted out of there so badly. Then the scene changed. I was outside in a place that looked like California, there was wealth everywhere, huge boats, mansions, cars, you name it and the same dead eyed, aggressive people. They were driving their boats and toys and shopping for more, constantly more, consuming and consuming in a frenzied state. The scene panned out and i saw the rest of the world, the third world was slowly being sucked dry, literally. the water, plants, trees, everything was being sucked into the vortex of the western world until there was nothing but death. the third world people with their sad eyes, starving, looking in at us as we destroyed everything, asking us why? No one cared, they just kept consuming until they eventually destroyed themselves. The last scene was a huge mountain of things, boats, cars, etc piled up to the sky and the last human beings lying on top of it, starving and dead. And that was the end of mankind. It terrified me. The message was obvious of course.

The next experience was even worse, this is where i had to look at myself, deeply, truly, no denial. The ibogaine took me into different scenes in my life, things i have said and done that were awful. I saw the ugliness in myself, the dysfunction. Not only that but i saw myself as others saw me, that was the worst part. I couldn't hide in denial anymore, it was all laid out raw and ugly, the shame i felt was all consuming. Its hard to even recollect it now without feeling the embarrassment and shame again. This went on for what felt like and eternity, its hard to describe how awful this was. Ibogaine is not a gentle teacher. I saw other things during this time to, realities about the world, things i didn't want to see, dark, evil ugly things, its like the veil of denial was stripped from everything, myself, the world, everything became clear and it wasn't pretty. A harsh wake up call doesn't even touch it.

Next i was taken into my darkest fear, i believe this is where a lot of my dysfunction stemmed from and this was by far the hardest and scariest of all the experiences ive had. I saw my future play out in front of me. I saw myself drugged on opium, dropped out of life, slowly going insane. I was like a parasite, clinging onto my partner demanding he take care of me, supply my drugs, pay the rent, everything, while i slowly went crazy. He finally had enough and wanted me to leave his house but i wouldn't go, he ended up calling my father and having me removed from the house, i had to be institutionalised. I found myself in an insane asylum, i was completely mad, i was stuck in an eternal thought loop pacing the room in circles. I was trapped in this place for the rest of my life. This went on for what felt like hours until i started to believe it was real and i really was insane and trapped in this state. I thought that the only escape was to kill myself but then saw that it wouldn't work, i would be lost in insanity, alone, in the afterlife forever. I saw only darkness around me, i was utterly and completely alone in blackness in an eternal thought loop of insanity. I have never felt such fear in my entire life. I must have sat in this reality for 3 or 4 hours, believing i would be this way forever. i cant describe the fear.

I finally came out of it a bit and went to talk to my partner, afterwards he said the look on my face terrified him, he has never seen someone look so lost and afraid. he tried to calm me down and told me to go have a warm shower. I did, and this is the wonderful part, the part that makes this all worthwhile and more. As i stood in the shower with the warm water flowing over me i started to cry, the sadness for myself, for the world, for all the suffering of all the souls overwhelmed me. I was flooded with a great cosmic sadness and empathy for everything. it was cathartic, the tears just flowed and flowed. i started to pray. (i will say at this point that i was not a religious or spiritual person in anyway. I was very much a pseudo-intellectual, very stuck in my head, arrogant and dismissive of anything to do with the concept of God or a higher power of any kind. I believed when ur dead ur dead, done deal. I mocked the people that had faith, felt they were just weak and ignorant.) So for me to pray at that point was a last resort, a complete surrender, i finally had to admit that i was tiny, weak and powerless and i needed help. i cried and prayed, im not even sure what or whom i prayed to at that point but i surrendered.

I was answered, it was indescribable, i felt a warmth come over me, it started as the warm flow from the water then into my heart and belly, it spread out through my body filling my soul with what i can only describe as complete and utter acceptance and unconditional love. I was so overwhelmed with this feeling of love that i started crying again, but this time tears of joy, that has never happened to me before. I knew in my soul that i would never be alone, that my fear was not real, that i was loved, i belonged, that all i had to do was reach out and ask, from my heart, surrendered, and have faith in what people must mean when they say GOD. Not the God of dogma, religion or anything of this material earth but what is to me an energy, an all powerful, creative, pure LOVE energy. That's all it was, an energy, a consciousness of love. it was beautiful, and the most real thing i have ever felt. I have never doubted my faith in this again, for me i know this is real and i am now a believer. I am not trying to convince anyone of anything, this is my personal experience, my path, so i am not going to debate it in a religious context here. Just take it how you like. It saved my life. Now the fear is gone, it is released forever, i will never fear insanity or isolation again. the depression is gone, it has been years and i have not had an episode and i know i never will again. when i am sad i am just sad and its ok. i have forgiven and accepted the people in my past, i have let go of the resentment and anger that was like a cancer in my heart. Everything is different but by no means perfect. I still have to work everyday to stay healthy and connected to my faith and to grow and become better. I still slide back but its always two steps forward one step back.

This love energy stayed with me for weeks at a time, I was blessed to experience living in absolute bliss, in a state of unconditional love for myself and everyone/everything. Spiritual insights came to me constantly while in this state. I understood that the world was just as it should be just as it was at this time in our spiritual evolution, all the pain, ugliness, beauty and wonder of it was a grand plan, it all made sense. all i needed to do was accept and love, try to be better everyday. We are spiritual children, kindergarten, learning lessons such as dont hurt each other, dont take whats not yours, be kind, live in harmony with nature etc. Very simple lessons but tough all the same and we are all evolving, we are all destined to live in love energy, we are all one, in this together. I saw the pain, the beauty, all of it and it was ok. Everything is evolving toward perfection. The closest doctrines i have found that seem to have coincided with the insights i have received have been the Rosicrucian mysteries, the natural laws. i wont get into it, you can look it up online if you like. I also wont get into a debate on the Rosicrucians, i know nothing of them, i just saw that the natural laws were the same as the information i was getting thru the ibogaine experience. That fascinated me.

For weeks after these experiences i would have no desire whatsoever for opium or alcohol, i did not eat anything but fresh organic food, i had no cravings or desires that were unhealthy. I barely needed sleep, i lived very simply. i lived the way i feel i naturally was meant to live. This was not a magic cure, dont get me wrong, i have smoked opium again a number of times, and used alcohol, but these things no longer have the hold on me they used to, i no longer need them, its more just an escape, every few months or so ill partake. i feel i will eventually give it up forever. I have left my dysfunctional relationship, have a good job, a great social life, i am generally happy. my life is very different. I credit all of this to ibogaine.

tl;dr: I was a depressed opium addict, I did ibogaine 6 times, had a horrific experience but then found love, truth, freedom. Cured my depression and addiction and am now living a happy healthy life.

I thought I'd introduce myself. I'm a long time drugs forum user and a long time /r/opiates stalker. I really love this community. It's incredible to know that I'm not alone in my addiction, and it's bittersweet to have people I can relate to in such crazy ways.

I'm a 20 year old recent college grad/accountant (BBA, going for my MBA soon) in smalltown/oiltycoon, Texas. I was one of those weird homeschool kids growing up, and had the privilege/opportunity to graduate highschool when I was 16 and go straight into college. 

My addiction started when I started breaking bones at the age of 15. Got prescribed tons of lortabs over the years and haven't really looked back since. I still suffer from chronic pain due to several injuries, but due to my age, no one wants to treat me for chronic pain. My father has been addicted his whole life, and I suppose I followed in his footsteps. 

Playing PS4, making music, work, spending time with my lovey girlfriend (*who has no idea about my habit*) and snorting pretty whiteish/yellow powder are what my life is all about.

It is kind of like scratched, but not like creating an indent in the marble... it like scratches the surface and some weird looking dust comes off... that looks like my heroin -.-.... anyways so I'm pretty sure I didn't realize this because the dust looked like the heroin I had and snorted definitely some of that nasty crap... is snorting marble shavings bad for you....? I really didn't mean to do this but I just want to know if I'll be okay... I feel fine right now but wtf... I did not expect shavings to come off from cutting/scraping my dope that looked exactly like my dope... 

After cleaning the table with heavily to make sure it wasn't something else, I then scraped the marble table again and the weird shavings came out again!!! at first I had this crazy thought is my table made of heroin? lol...",1414452708.0

What pain killers will get through the suboxone/subutex opiate blcoking (more details in text)? Need pain relief ASAP,"So I had excruciating tooth pain over the weekend.  I've been on subutex for 5 years since I got clean.  I tried taking extra subutex, and I tried taking Norco (hydrocodone 10mg) over and over all thru the weekend.  I must have downed 60 mgs but to no avail.  The pain was still there.  The dentist prescribed me percocet because I suggested it, but I'm now worried it's not enough.  How much more hardcore do I have to go?  Will the percocet work or will I have to get some straight-up Oxycontin? Fellow suboxone takers, what has helped you with pain management?

Edit: Pain is finally manageable! Yay! Not sure if it's the oxy or the fact that it's been 48 hours.  But even though  the pain is not gone, it is at a level that I can tolerate okay.

Some clarification: I am on a low dose, long term subutex maintenance program.  I call myself sober because I do not take drugs to help me avoid feelings/future/life. I work my 12 steps, I go to meetings, and I do not engage in the bad behavior or avoidance I did before I got sober.  I have never gotten ""high"" off of subutex.  I started taking it in rehab, but at a dose where I still experienced withdrawal effects from oxy/heroin. Maybe at that point if I'd taken a shit ton of it, it would have been possible to have some kind of high, or a euphoric experience.  I have been taking it because a) it's a safety net and b) there have now been several studies showing that it can improve chances at long-term sobriety across a variety of substances (not just opiates). But I don't feel any mental side effects from it at all.  I don't get a buzz.  I don't use it to cope with my life.  I don't even remember to take it every day (my body reminds me a day after I skip a dose, so I dont forget multiple days in a row).  I have no desire to take more than my prescribed dose. So yeah, I consider myself normal and sober.  I am spiritually and mentally healthy,which is what matters to me.

(x-post from /r/Drugs),"I'd like to buy poppy seeds in bulk (ten to fifty pounds) but there are so many seed varieties. I'm not concerned about organic, but they must be unwashed. The main seeds offered in bulk seem to be Tasmanian poppy, spanish blue, Afghani blue, Dutch gray, Indian white, and Tasmanian Giganthium. There are so many cultivars with widely differing alkaloid contents that I'm at a loss. I want something unwashed (organic doesn't concern me), that I can buy in 10, 20, or 50 pound quantities (4.3kg, 9.0kg, and 22.6kg respectively for our non-American friends).
How do I choose? Which one has the highest alkaloid content? Which will make the best and strongest PST? I'm not looking for sources, I'm just looking for recommendations on the best *P. somniferum* seeds for preparing tea and if they are available in bulk. 


While we're here, what's your personal method for preparing PST? I use a one quart glass mason jar, add 200g-400g seeds, juice from one lemon (about 45ml), and 1¾ cups (about 420ml) cool but not cold water. Shake vigorously for fifteen to twenty minutes— remember, the alkaloids are on the outsides of the seeds, you need to scrub them off and into the acidulated water. Strain, add an equal amount of grapefruit juice (grapefruit juice contains a potent cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor, allowing for an increased high. It also masks the bitter taste of PST) Enjoy slowly. 

Thanks, Reddit.

###Research I've Gathered

Because the family *Papaveraceae* has many subspecies, varieties, and cultivars, all with differing alkaloid contents, choice of the proper seed for PST are important to me. Ranges of morphine content are 0% to 30% of dried weight material depending on condition of the sample, cultivar, climate, soil analysis, et cetera... Wouldn't seeds from a high alkaloid *Papaverum somniferum* strain would contain more active alkaloids, and therefore make more potent tea, than seeds from a cultivar that's been selectively bred to reduce alkaloid content? In addition, would one want to avoid cultivars with high contents of papaverine, oleamide, and noscapine, in favor of those with high contents of morphine, codeine, and thebane?

For example, *P. somniferum* var. *Tasmanian purple* (a strain I've not found in seed packs of more than 250, unfortunately) would probably be the most desirable seed for PST, given its ±30% alkaloid content, but it's cost prohibitive. *P. somniferum* var. *India white* boasts a ±25% alkaloid content, and one can get in in bulk. To further illustrate te variance of alkaloid content in *P, somniferum* seeds, one can refer to Jim Hogshire's seminal text *Opium For The Masses*. He assays the alkaloid content of seeds as ranging from 7µg-200µg per seed. Further paraphrasing Mr. Hogshire's, a study featured in *Forensic Sci Int 27* pgs. 111-117 (1985) assessed several different lots and strains of seeds for morphine and found a range of 4mg-200mg. 

My logic and interest behind the ""higher alkaloid strain equals stronger tea"" theory came from reading an article about *P. somniferum spp.* vars. *Norman* and *Przemko*, both of which have been selectively bred for alkaloid contents of less than 1%. My immediate thought was that they would make terrible PST, and bang, I had a brilliant flash about how to make much stronger PST.  To this effect, I'm attempting to compile a list of all commercially available unwashed P. somniferum seeds, and their alkaloid contents. Please contribute or correct if you can.

###***Papaverum somniferum*** Cultivars and Varieties by Alkaloid Content

##Cultivars with known alkaloid contents:

* *P. somniferum* var *Tasmanian Purple* (Alkaloid content ±30%) 
* *P. somniferum* var. *India White* (Alkaloid content ±25%)
* *P. somniferum* var. *Norman* (Alkaloid content <1%)
* *P. somniferum* var. *Przemko* (Alkaloid content <1%)

##Cultivars with estimated alkaloid content:

* *P. somniferum* vars. *Tasmanian poppy* (assumed +20% alkaloid content, the variety is an earlier strain of *P. somniferum* var *Tasmanian Purple* ) 
* *P. somniferum* var *Tasmanian Giganthium* et *White Giant* (assumed +20% alkaloid content, the variety is an earlier strain of *P. somniferum* var *Tasmanian Purple*)

##Cultivars with unknown alkaloid contents *(please contribute if you can)*:

* *P. somniferum* var. *Persian Blue* (Possibly also known as ""afghani blue"", ""afghani blue earth"" or are these different cultivars?)
* P. somniferum* var. *Burma White* (possibly also known as 'China White')
* P. somniferum* var. *Turkish White/Red* (Color of the flowers of poppies vary widely, from my research this has no effect on the alkaloid content so I'm listing these together)
* P. somniferum* var. *Asian Red/Pink/White* (Color of the flowers of poppies vary widely, from my research this has no effect on the alkaloid content so I'm listing these together)
* P. somniferum* var. *Dutch Grey*
* P. somniferum* var. *Amsterdam Blue Glaze*
* P. somniferum* var. *Spanish Blue*
* P. somniferum* var. *Tasmanian Tomniferum*

Really was my own fault, although alarms werent going off immediately. This doesn't have to do with Opiates, besides the fact that my DOC is any opiate/opioid... Anyways, I am good on methadone but sometimes I wanna party and have fun so I seek out 'delics sometimes. Well, I hit up someone I havent talked to in a while. I met him in Drug Court a couple years back. We talked a bit, but I always thought he was kind of dim. He is one of those ADHD tweakers that are all over the place, talk a million miles per minute, think they are really smart but in reality they are dim dim dim. I don't talk to tweakers much, don't really relate and try to avoid them. I just can't really stand them much. 

Anyways, hadn't talked to this dude in a while. Like 7 months, heard he was using again, so figured hey, I could hit him up and maybe he could find something, as everyone I hit up was dry. He said ""yeah bro, hit me up on my phone"", I text im, he calls, says he is on his way to my house. Gets here. He is driving a nice car... But you could tell he was cracked out. Didn't think too much of it cuz he always seemed to be on a perma tweak, but he seemed extra tweaky. I figured I could trust him cuz we used to chill alot. He also didn't mention anything that set off alarms or anything. I am not dumb, I can usually tell when someone is going to rip me off and in the fucking 10 years that I have been using (mainly opiates) I have NEVER been ripped off. Not once. I have aborted deals because they seemed sketch and I could tell that they were going to do it. Nothing set off alarm bells. As he was leaving he mentioned some story about his cat, and that someone mistreated it and that he believes in karma... It wasn't in a way that seemed like he was trying to emphasize that he beleives in karma and wanted to plant it in my head that he would never rip me off. Off he went.

I talked to him via text. He responded each time I texted. Said he was waiting for the guy to come back. I ended up passing out. I woke up two hours later, there was a missed text saying he was still waiting. I text him back, saying sorry, I passed out, whats the story?"" He responds immediately, saying the guy still hasnt come... blah blah fucking blah. No alarms set off in my mind. I figure they are running on tweaker time. 30 minutes later he updates, saying ""sorry, still waiting""... He kept updating me for the next two hours. Nothing but the same story. 

The waiting started at noon. Pretty much, he kept updating all day. Usualy when people rip people off, they stop responding immediately. They sometimes shut their phone off. If they are intelligent they will block your number on their smartphone (if they have it, but this guy is dim. He has a smartphone. In hindsight, he probably wasn't smart enough to block my number). Plus the fact that I knew him, it made me drop my guard. Now, its been 10 fucking hours. He stopped responding 2 hours ago. Pretty much positive he ripped me off. If I hadn't know him, after two hours I would of know. But since I knew him, and he said he had a couple things to do with no set time frame, I would of known two hours into it. 

So now I am left with a dilemma on my hands. How to handle this. I am not a fan of fighting. I will try all means to resolve any situation before I fight. I just don't like it. But I am a big guy and I know how to handle myself. I for one cannot believe he had the balls to rip me off. He knows who I am. He also believes that I am some big guy in Anonymous, that I have connections and that I am capable of things. Again, as I said he is DIM. 

So I am trying to figure out how to handle this. I know where he works. I have his phone number. I can find out all his information online. I know his boss. I know his girlfriend. It is so insane that he thought he could get away with it. 


TL;DR Some tweaker ripped me off. 
So what do?

Also, Moral of the story, never deal with tweakers. I have met some strung out junkies, but every tweaker I know has been ripped off in their dealings. Everytime I have heard of someone getting ripped off, it was always by a tweaker. I have heard of junkies ripping people off, robbing pharmacies, robbing people, but not as much as tweakers.

I don't think I have ever been as battered physically or mentally as last night. I am posting this as an experience and warning, It was one of the most horrible experiences in my life but at the same time enlightening.

I am on 100mg of methadone daily, it has done wonders for my life and well being. I binged a little on the weekend and gobbled up my take away doses for a bit of a nod. Come yesterday I am out but not feeling horrible, however a friend passes me an old box of subutex. I figure well it's been near 40+ hours since my last dose there shouldn't be that high a chance of precipitation.

I mull up 12mg through a micron bang it and suddenly everything starts to sound a bit odd, like as if I was in a tunnel. Things go blurry, at this point I know what I have just done. The fear of all the gods I believe in hit me, I am not naive to precipitated withdrawal however never experienced it truly myself I have just read stories on opiophile or talked to folks who have experienced it. It can't be that bad right? Everyone exaggerates? Those were the last thoughts in my head before it got real.

I fall down on the bathroom floor the wd symptoms are so severe I can only scream. This is nothing like withdrawals I have dealt with in the past, It felt as if I were being flayed inside and out with demons gnawing on my hands and feet. I tell my wife what is happening, tell her if my breathing or heartbeat gets to extreme to call the ambulance. She is fucking furious, but thankfully drags my bulky self to the couch and puts a bucket next to me. The next 6 hours are violent screaming, torrents of sweat everywhere, tears, shit coming out of my nose I didn't even know I had, flailing of arms and legs, Even having clothes on is painful, the bed is painful, the air is painful with sudden normal withdrawal symptoms enhanced by at least 10 times. I continued to throw up for that 6 hours, by the end it was just bile. I shat myself a little on the couch, luckily I had pants on. I was lapsing in and out of consciousness from the pain and nervous system overload. The main symptoms ended after about six hours.

I am thankful I banged it and not put it under my tongue as the precipitation would have lasted quite a bit longer, It is now +19 hours since the shot and I am just feeling the double dose of methadone I took quite early this morning. How I got to the pharmacy was beyond me, they asked me for urinalysis today.. Like fuck. When people tell you to be careful with partial agonists, agonist/antagonist combos don't take the advice lightly. I have come away from this with an utter shock at my stupidity, an enhanced love for my wife who had to deal with me, an understanding now of what agony truly is, and also what my body can cope with.

Had a conversation with her today, was calm and did not attack her or accuse her at all, and she tearfully admitted to smoking hash a time or two a week over the last two months.  I didn't question her about the residue or what I googled it could have been, I just let her tell me what she wanted to tell me and left it at that.  At the end of the day we are breaking up and she will be on her own so she technically owes me no explanation (but I do have a sense of just wanting to make sure she's ok).  Just so we are clear since we are in the opiates sub...hash is not really a big deal to me.  I smoked a lot when I was younger and don't even really consider it a true ""drug"" as the government defines illegal substances.  Her reasons for smoking behind my back were 1) she was stressed out about having doubts about our future and then 2) once she made the decision to move out she got depressed about her future without me in it, which is what she's dealing with now.  Its going to suck, we have a long and awesome relationship all the way up until the last few months.  We agreed there were faults on both our parts that led to where we are.  I appreciate all the comments - both the anecdotal evidence from people who have been through a drug situation with a loved one, as well as the ones telling me I was being WAY controlling/possessive due to the ending of my relationship.  From the looks of it, reality fell somewhere in the middle.  As it stands we are splitting amicably and I have made sure she understands that if she ever gets in a tight spot where she doesn't feel like she has anyone to turn to, she can always count on me as a friend.

Thanks again.

Need some help from what looks like a knowledgeable group.
GF and I have been going through a rough patch (she's actually moving out) and I noticed her mood has been different lately.  Sometimes right when she gets home from work she is energetic and upbeat, other times she will go to bed and sleep for 12 hours straight.

Cut to today, cleaning trash out of her car I found lighters (she doesn't smoke) and an old ID card with brown sweet smelling residue running over it, with a thick black chunk of residue in one corner.  I also found what reminds me of a multi-tool with the pliers only miniature (like a roach clip?) that has the same sticky brown sweet smelling residue on it.

Any ideas what this could be?  Searching the web leads to oxy or H but I never see tin foil.  It looks like the ID card is used to put something on to heat it up (as evidenced by the thick black char in one corner and brown sticky streams running away from it).

Before I confront her - anything else I can keep an eye out for?  Paraphernalia, moods... I don't see any pipes or any powder or baggies laying around to confirm anything.  Am I being paranoid?  She used to hard drugs in the past, before we met, and the reason I worry now is that this residue is on an ID card she got during the course of us being together.

Thanks in advance for any help guys. ",1414541468.0

I'm worried I hit a artery. 
I hit the vein on my inside wrist. I've hit here two times before and this time was different. When I got in the vein the blood was normal colored and came in normal speed but when I pushed It hurt so I pulled the plunger back and blood barely  came back in. Very very slow like I wasn't in but this needle was kinda dull and the shot was thick so I figured it couldn't pull any up. 
Anyways I moved around a little and when I thought I was in I pushed the rest in. It wasn't a intense pain but felt like I was missing a little. But now it's swollen but doesn't feel like a missed shot it's not hard it's soft and squishy.

Recently fell off the wagon, relapsed for a few months. DOC was roxies, anywhere from 90 - 210 mgs a day. I'm on Day 5 of my detox and good lord it was hard. I'm taking naltrexone and getting back on Vivitrol until I can get my damn life back together yet again.

Getting high is not in the cards in my forseeable future as I do not think I could handle another 12 hours of vomiting.  

How long does it generally take / is it even possible - to return to a state of opiate naiveté? Like, if six months from now I picked up a few pills would I experience WD? Does the body remember? Would I have to wait years?

I've never gone more than 2-3 days without anything, and I'm really scared to have to stop taking them. I literally don't even know/can't remember what it's like to be sober. I've passed so many crucial points in my life/growing up on opiates, so I don't even know who/how I am off of them. I don't know how to be a functioning sober adult in society because I've never had to do it before. I don't know how to cope with the struggles of life without opiates. I don't know how to manage my depression and emotions without drugs... I feel like my whole world is starting to collapse in front of me now because my crutch is being taken away from me. 

Has anyone else's doctor stopped prescribing them because of the schedule change? How are you dealing with it? ",1414618757.0

Backstory; I'm a middle class lookin white dude with glasses, I basically look like I can fix your computer. I also live in a city not far from the border of Mexico, so I get really good BTH for good prices. I live near a black hood but I travel about 30 miles to another part of town to score cuz that's where my connect is... The problem is that my car took a shit on me so I've had to take the buses and trains and it takes me like 2 hours to get up there. 4 hour round trip. Suffice it to say, it's a bitch when I know I probably pass a hundred dealers on my way to meet this one. My question, there an apartment complex by my house that always has a couple black guys posted out front and there's shoes on a telephone wire by the complex. Black shoes, idk if that makes a difference. As someone who's never cold copped, what kinda risks am I lookin at approaching these people? I don't look like your typical user. Last thing I wanna do is sketch them out and get shot. I've heard shoes could mean that crack is sold here, no thank you. I've heard they could mean heroin is sold here, YES PLEASE! And I've also heard it could signify that a gang murder has taken place or that this is gang territory or something, which is obvious lol.. Last question, do black gangs usually get their H through the MM too, so is it marked up, should I go straight to the source or can I save time and get same prices in local hood? Any advice is highly appreciated. Forgive my noobiness...

In my experience a lot of those vendors are unreliable and take forever to ship. How do you guys keep from getting sick while you wait? Do you keep a local dopeman around just in case? Do you scam a Dr or ER into hooking you up with painkillers while you wait? Do you just take subs to stave off WD?

I've always been curious about this aspect of being a junkie who cops online.

Also DNM prices tend to be about 2x the price of copping locally, with the price rather mediocre or at least the same I can get locally and I get my shit in hand whenever I want 24/7.

I guess my other question is WHY do you cop on the Darknet instead of getting from the dopeman up the street?

She broke her back and now being unable to work, she's had nearly 12 surgery's over the course of 20+ years! As for me, I used to play football back in High School and one game day I got hit so hard it completely tore the largest muscle in my back...I've been to almost as many doctors and gone under as many surgery's as her in my shorter life time!

Anyway, we've both been on pain meds for years (she used to be prescribed the OC 80s way back in the day but that came to an end as we all know...and I've been on Percocet, Vicodin, Roxi, etc.) Then one day, one of my good friends from high-school comes by and tells me he has something that'll help us way more than what we're using: Heroin. We dabbled in it and eventually got addicted (shocker, right?) It had gotten so bad at one point, we were stealing thousands of dollars a day just to get our fix and not to feel the pain anymore. Finally, my mom came in one day and we talked about it, realizing that this HAD to stop or we were gonna go to jail or end up dead in a gutter. We stopped and went back to using what we were prescribed and all was good. Things had gotten back to their usual selves and we were happy to not be chasing down that high anymore, we were okay with what were given and it helped our pain.

Enter the other day...my friend from before pops back up, usually he comes to talk to me but oddly he goes and talks to my mom and completely ignores me. First red flag, then they go outside and talk so they know I wouldn't follow/hear them. Next thing I know, he's gone and she comes back in and obviously I ask her what it was about and she shrugged it off. Later on that day, my mom heads into the bathroom and is in there for nearly an hour and this is an obvious sign to me so I knock, she answers with a slurred speech. I know for a fact now what's going on, so I jimmy the door open and find her, an entire rig set up and a big bundle, so I did what I had to do...I took them, flushed them down the toilet. I know some of you are probably going to call me an idiot for not re-selling it or something but I just had to stop her from heading down that long, endless road...I found myself kind of surprised by my own actions, I was really swept up in the hold of H when we first did it and here I am taking charge and stopping another bad trip.

I've always been one of those ""chippers"" that manages to hide their use by way of, well, not being a stereotypical junkie scumbag (all my love to the stereotypical junkie scumbags on this forum). I'm educated and employed, except sometimes I'm really sweaty and nauseous and sick looking, and people always ask me why I have a stuffy nose (""Um, allergies?"")

I recently moved to a different country in order to go to graduate school. Dream of a lifetime. But I was also thinking ""Hey, I'm far away from everyone I know who would ever be up my ass, so I can use without consequences, right?"" So I got some #3 (new to me!) and spent an entire four day weekend smoking it on foil. AMAZING. By far my favorite ROA yet (and yes, I have tried shooting up).

Except it made me so sick in the lungs that I *literally* couldn't breathe, couldn't even stand up in the shower, and a result couldn't get out of bed to go to class all week, let alone do the fuckton of reading I'm supposed to do in grad school. Probably a little withdrawal on top of that too. And it's not like I wasn't expecting it, I always get lung problems when I use. 

But I'm not in undergrad anymore, I can't be fucking around like this. Everyone in my course thinks I have bronchitis (which I do?) and they've been giving me nothing but sympathy and letting me borrow their course notes and I just feel *so guilty* about it. If I wasn't a scumbag drug user this wouldn't have had happened. I'm so paranoid that all of these awesome people that I just met are going to ""figure me out"" and hate me for it.

I always told myself that once my use started to interfere with my actual ambition, I would stop. It was easy to get away with this when I worked a bullshit job and didn't have to use my brain, but I took out all these student loans to do WELL, I worked my ass off to get accepted to do WELL, not to be so sick all the time that I can't/won't do my work. 

So I'm done. Might as well quit while I'm ahead...or at least not as behind as I could be. Chamomile tea and valium from here on out. Thanks for listening, bropiates. Happy halloween. ",1414703282.0

Ok. So, I've been buying dope here for not so long, so I'm new too the scene. Well, I buy a bundle yesterday and this is unlike any dope I've ever felt, as in, it probably wasn't dope. I did feel the familiar side-effects, such as, the warmth feeling, the rush, nodding, etc., but along with that, I had this overwhelming feeling of stimulation. If I could compare to anything it'd most likely be MDMA or coke. I've never tried Crack, so I can't if it felt anything like that or not. I would get this, very much, on edge feeling after 4 or 5 hours of use. I'm on my last bag of this bundle and if I didn't get any sleep (I take amphetamines, so it's hard to say whether or not the amphetamines keep me awake or this unknown substance(s)) I would've gone insane. Before I took my nap earlier I literally losing it. Saying and acting like a fucking insane person, lol. Like I knew at the moment I was acting crazy, but didn't care or wasn't able to control myself. I'm pretty much normal now, but this is shit fucking horrible and I can't understand why anyone would cut a downer, such as dope, with s stimulant!?

In comparison to the actual physical dangers of SSRI's, etc...","I have had chronic back pain and depression for awhile now.  A few years ago I was in an accident and had to take Norco for almost two years.  It was amazing....no more back pain, happiness.  Fortunately (or maybe unfortunately), I recovered from my accident and benefitted enough from physical therapy to the point that they took me off the Norco.  Back pain returned as did anxiety and depression.  I discussed this with my doctor, and said I would like to be back on the Norco.  Of course, I got no Norco.  Instead, for the past year and a half, I have been on every drug you can think of, all with their horrible risks and side effects.  SSRI's, tricyclics, NSAIDS, tramadol....risks of bleeding ulcers, seizures, weight gain, stroke, muscle spasms, sleeplessness, sleepiness, etc.  The list goes on.  Most of the time, these drugs have withdrawal symptoms, which they call ""discontinuation syndrome"" when referring to non-narcotic meds with wd symptoms (which is just shady in itself).  

My doctor said narcotics were dangerous, causing addiction and withdrawal.  Seems to me other drugs are more dangerous (do people not become addicted to anti-depressants and suffer wd when ""discontinuing?).  So I'm wondering....are their any other real physical risks to taking opiates long-term? 

I have read that heroin can cause infections, liver disease, heart disease, etc.  From what I can tell, these would be due to impurities or less-than-sterile IV-conditions, or even smoking.  Is that true?  Or does the actual drug cause these conditions?  Do people with access to pharmaceuticals suffer these risks as well?  Or is the risk addiction?  And then the subsequent risk of being cut off from the drug that is working miraculously for you and has changed your life?

I think that most of the side effects from pharmaceutical opiate use can be managed...such as a high-fiber diet or laxatives to combat constipation.  Seems a lot easier than managing bleeding ulcers.  Why do these drugs that can have such a benefit on people lives have such a bad rap?  Is it solely because they are addictive?

Pretty opiate naive, except from when I was prescribed, and just looking for opinions, feelings about this from more experienced users.  I know that addiction can be a horrible thing, but are most of those problems caused by lack of access to the drug and impurities?

tl;dr  Opiates are awesome for depression and other things, why are they so frowned upon and hard to get prescribed when they work so well?  Why are other pills that don't work as well and have more side effects prescribed more frequently?

Compared with PST, I can pick up 10 lbs and it lasts me at least a week and it's less than $30.  I've found my ""methadone"".  Yes there are w/ds with PST but it's not nearly as bad since I don't load up on massive doses of it when I make tea.

2ksrhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2ksrhy/h_and_mdma_mothballing/,22,https://redd.it/2ksrhy,HThrowAwayAccount,H and MDMA (mothballing??),"Gone with mothballing as never heard a name for this combo before?

Anyway, although I'm not a fan of uppers I make an exception for MDMA as other properties of it are ace. I've tried this combo when rolling / just eating the MD and smoking or snorting the H. I've never shot MD before.

As I've not shot MD I'm thinking try it on its own first then another time go for the mothball. So, about 50mg MD and and a nice healthy amount of H.

The MD is very good quality, from DNM's. I've had it before and regent tested very dark. Vendor claims 80 odd% but either way its veryvgood quality. This will hopefully be with #4, not #3. 

Has anyone tried this combo? Reading elsewhere there is an epic rush with just MD, no come up just bang great rush and rolling. Shorter duration too.
