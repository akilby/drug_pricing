  Picked up a gram this morning (2x half gram) for £40 . My dealer has moved to the top flat in the block as she got busted 2 days ago so she's using a friends flat that lives in the same block and she's just put a note on the door to go up stairs . Think she's done this as obviously she needs to keep dealing to support her habit plus the police here tend to do multiple busts if they don't get anything the first time around as the warrent is active for about a week or something like that so they can come back at any time . Plus they would need to get a new warrent for the new address she's punting from . 

  I also picked up 70ml of methadone a m8 owed me when I got of the bus . Think I've got about 200/250 ml for a rainy day . Or when I run out of money !

I am 18 and I got addicted to heroin when I was just about to turn 15. Most of my friends smoked it off foil but I always wanted to take things to the next level so my third or fourth time got my hands on some H I got an older friend of mine(probably about 20) and I convinced him to relapse and buy me some rigs. Things got sour pretty quick, as I always went balls to the wall with anything I tried in my early teen years. I lived in a quiet California beach town that just so happened to have a vicious underbelly of drug addiction(the all too common story). So I carried on with a severe heroin dependence and even did a stint in rehab. But it never worked because I always came back to the same house. My parents are awesome btw, I really didn't have a legitimate reason to be a junkie like most of my friends did. Finally my parents picked up and moved to Bakersfield and put me on suboxone last year when I was 17. I was willing to accept anything as I hit rock bottom when I almost got a wrap for a stolen car that I had because it was given to me as collateral for a 50 bag(it was a Cadillac lol). 

Anyway this is pretty messy but over the last 12 months I've used heroin a few times. Probably 4 times. Twice while on suboxone, twice right after I got off of it(I've been off subs for about 2 months). The first time I visited my hometown after not having the buffer that is subs, I lapsed. The second time was the same but I was much more conscious, and it wasn't even fresh off subs, I was completely lucid and STILL did it. Because I don't live there and I've completely avoided people since my move, I haven't touched it. But is that really abstaining? Or just being too far from it? I can't tell if I'm ready to rejoin society. I absolutely despise myself, and after 12 months of subs, video games and poor habits I've gained 25 pounds on top of my naturally large 200lb/6ft physique. It may not seem like a lot but being a recluse for this long has made my ""sobriety"" seem more like someone just locked me in a closet for a year. I have dreams about heroin every night since I kicked subs. My libido is fucking bananas since my testosterone has come back in droves, but I have absolutely no inclination to socialize and meet people. Which really saddens me, as I thought I would get off suboxone and immediately be ready to get a six pack and pound vag. Anyway, if you managed to read this shit, thanks. My writing skills are sub-par at best, so please lemme know if you have any suggestions for my quasi-dilemma. ",1458123745.0

4ambj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4ambj2/opiates_and_exercise_anyone/,36,https://redd.it/4ambj2,Iwasatgoogies,Opiates and Exercise Anyone?,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub reddit to post this in or if y'all will give a fuck but whatever. I'm gonna preach for a sec.

I've been doing some research on opiate use and exercising, here's a interesting post I found:

""For those who use opiates/opioids physical activity is absolutely necessary. Exercise is the main way one can build endorphins and chemicals similar to opiates. Being on opiates makes your brain deficient in endorphins because it just doesn't have to make them anymore. Exercise forces the body to make its own endorphins therefore you can take less of your drugs and the more of its own endorphins your brain makes the easier it is to w/d from opiates.

The best kind of exercise for endorphin building seems to be vigorous exercise. 

""Some studies have shown that vigorous exercise executed by healthy individuals can effectively increase opioid peptides (aka endorphins, a naturally occurring opiate that in conjunction with other neurotransmitters is responsible for exercise induced euphoria and has been shown to be addictive), positively influence hormone production (i.e., increase testosterone and growth hormone), benefits that are not as fully realized with moderate exercise.""
http://www.vip-home-care.com/builden...naturally.html   ""

I've always had issues with depression, and it's a major reason why opiates have always been so alluring to me. I can take them and immediately feel gratified and that all is well. I also try to stay as healthy as possible, even with my vices(ironic I guess...but I can't seem to find information that opiates are bad for your organs or body otherwise. Correct me if I'm wrong please), so I try to exercise and weightlift a few times a week, it really does drastically benefit my mood, self esteem and my use. I get that feeling that I've accomplished something and that I'm at peace. Plus seeing the results and looking good is always a plus for me. When I have stopped focusing on health, my use got more frequent and intense. Exercise can be impossible to do during withdrawal..but I find it great for PAWS. I also recommend SEX, like a fuck ton of it if you can perform.

Basically, the ""runner's high"" is real af, it's endorphins being released. You can't argue with that. I have been ""addicted"" to working out and hitting the gym, real tawk. I feel like shit if I miss a gym session. But it is a struggle to find a balance where drugs aren't the priority in life. Who says opiate users have to be sick, weak, and lazy? But blowing of the gym to copp or get high has and will happen 8/

Do any of you guys exercise or try and keep up active lifestyles? Even with habits?(tough or near impossible for a heavy habit I'm sure but I've heard of Olympic runners who are alcoholics and chain smoke so anything is possible) I'm curious to hear your thoughts and personal stories on how exercise has played a roll in or benefited your use (also your habits, addictions, withdrawals too) What are your routines with opiates and working out?

It cushioned the sharpness of the world so that I could live comfortably and I started taking it all the time, more than I was supposed to. I quit taking it when my friend (who has so many issues, too) either stole it or ended up with it and my high school's dean of students told me I never should have brought it to school. She obviously didn't get my pain, either, but at least she pretty much made me quit.

Then, this past summer, I was pet-sitting for my grandparents one week and found an old bottle of Tylenol 3 in my grandmother's vanity. I took some and oh my god, it was amazing. I felt bad though and stopped stealing it. Then over Christmas break I stole mom's hydrocodone a few times then felt bad and stopped. 

Now I'm back home and I've learned cold water extraction of hydrocodone so I don't overdose on the tylenol in the tablets so I've been drinking water full of hydrocodone every night, ending up pretty stoned, then going to sleep. I know I need to stop but I feel so trapped and that's the only thing cushioning the blows of life. 

I'm also much more creative on opiates -- I used to be a talented writer then lost all confidence in my ability and stopped, but opiates bring the power of words back to me. They could poison me since I'm also on seroquel, but that almost doesn't even matter to me.

So now I'm 18 and nearly dependent on opiates. I know it's a slippery slope. I'm posting here for that reason: how do I stop before I really get started? I don't want to end up any more dependent than I am now. Is it simple willpower and saying no to myself or do I need to confess and get professional help?",1458093154.0

I do feel better but still have cravings, and skin is hot flashing and I feel like I'm acting how I am when I'm sick, just not much of the sickness.

I think it's because of the Xanax I took, when I take xans I usually can't gauge my wd's well enough to tell how deep in I am. 

My main goal is to get high today off of some h.

I'm thinking around the 6 hour mark that I'm gonna try and shoot half a point to a point to see how it makes me feel.

Only reason I'm doing this is because I've read numerous reports of people with metabolisms like mine, taking 2mg or lower, and it actually potentiating the dope and if not potentiating, still working the same, at the lowest 60% of the high. 

That happens apparently because there isn't enough bupe and binding at 2mg, so the h is either potentiated or still works just a tad bit less, not to the point of others on bupe maintenance and having to wait a day or two to feel anything. I took 2mg one day out of a month shooting habit.

So I'm prescribed Suboxone 8s and every now and then I'll sell one for $12-$15. I don't like to cuz I really need em but I will. So my longtime friend texts me asking if I can front him one. I hate fronting so I told him I will if he gives me $20 for it. I know that's expensive but my insurance stopped paying for the Rx and its really expensive now.

Anyway,  homeboy says he is withdrawing and can't sleep so end up fronting him. This was Saturday.  He says he will ""probably"" have the cash Tue or Wed. I asked him yesterday but he didn't have it. 

Well this morning he tells me he is going to Austin. I ask him if he will have it before he leaves and he says no. Now, if he doesn't have it its fine,  but the next shit he said..


He then texts he wont have it for '""awhile"". And that even if he DID have it he would make me wait because I ""overcharged"" him. I'm trying to stay calm and I tell him that he agreed to the price. He says again he doesn't have it (bullshit). I tell him that doesn't matter bc apparently he wouldn't give it to me anyway. 

THEN, he says that paying me back is at the bottom of his priority list. Like, wtf? This isn't some random dude we have been close friends for 8 or 9 years. Now, he's always had a bit of an attitude but he'd always pay me back around when he said he would. But it just seems like he is going out of his way to disrepect me and make me mad.

He didn't have any problem with the price when he was all sick and in need of my help. He could have said something n I probly would have lowered it. But to wait until the day of and then spring that... AND if he is driving to Austin (from San Antonio) for SXSW he obviously has some money! Damn...I just stopped texting him cause I'm not gonna blow up and get all mad, he seems like he wants that. 

But for real, I kinda feel like I'm just done with being his friend. I certainly wont front him or help him again..and he will be sick again eventually. I can't be cool with someone that would be so disrespectful to me. 

If y'all want I can post the chatlog as kind of a tldr. I really just posted this to vent, but I'm wondering if I should just cut ties with this dude. He has been a good friend for awhile, and I think that's worth more than $20 but damn.

I've got a weird story for you, it's not really opiates related but it happened while I was pretty blasted and the resolution is being celebrated right now with White Russians & fiya ECP >:D 

It's bit of a long rid and I apologize beforehand for my wordiness. Enjoy! 

This happened a month and a half ago. My hubby and I were out near our apartment on a walk & getting some smokes at 5am pretty loaded up. We were on a semi-sketchy street (only at night) in an okay neighborhood in a big city. Never thought there'd be any danger for us though. 

As we were walking home, around the corner comes a random tall Puerto Rican dude with a metal shovel and he seems to be rambling incoherently at us. We thought he was just some drunk ass fool high on PCP or some shit and basically tried to ignore him and walk pass. 

You know where this is going... All of a sudden out of NOWHERE this dude raises his shovel and the next thing I know my guy is on the ground, out cold. Now this dude doesn't even care about me a short skinny ass girl being right next to them, he's yelling some shit at my poor hubs who's trying to get up from the frozen ground about not to fuck with him or whatever. I'm just freaking the fuck out and don't know what just happened in the past 5 seconds which seemed like a fucking eternity :( 

Now this is gonna sound real stupid but my dumbass somehow senses he wasn't gonna do nothing to me and panics, yelled at him wtf is going on?! He's waving this long metal shovel, trying to kick my guy back down but misses a few times probably due to him being inebriated as all hell and goes ""HE TOOK MY FUCKING CRACK!!"" 

Wait what? We don't even smoke crack! 

Finally my guy manages to get up and grabs my frozen dumbass and BOOK IT. While we were running back home we look back and the assailant was just standing at the spot and looking at us, but we didn't and couldn't stop until we got into our apartment behind a big heavy metal front gate. 

Now I started to cry from the relief and scare when I begin to process what just happened and saw blood on my guy's face... By the way, he's not a weak looking dude by any chance, 190lbs hunk of muscle, ex-body builder with an intimidating atmosphere, no person in their right mind would try to fight him. He only got hit b/c the dude came out of nowhere and he would never ever get in a situation that puts me in danger, which is why he grabbed me and ran instead of beating the living shit out of the guy. 

He didn't have any broken tooth, the blood came from cuts inside of his cheek where the shovel hit. I INSISTED on calling the cops b/c 1)there's a crazy motherfucker out there hitting people with a shovel over allegedly stolen crack and 2)it happened less than 10 blocks from our apartment and my school. 

The cops responded rather quickly, and being the absolute finest of law enforcements, proceeded to spend the next 1.5 hour having us recount the incident to 4 (FOUR!) different teams before even attempt to look for anyone matching our description by driving around the scene. Sigh. 

Eventually the case landed in the hands of a detective in our precinct. Even though we have: a victim who can positively ID the attacker, a witness who was right there when it took place, exact location and time, exact description of the dude, security footages of the dude walking towards the location with a shovel, of him walking back and handing the shovel off to a second guy who we know works at a deli on the corner (while we can be seen running across the street in the background), store owners who recognized the guy to be local penisface drug dealer, known spots where he sells drugs etc.... All this motherfuckin info and it still took the PD a month and a half with pretty much no communication to finally call us and say they've arrested the fuckhead. We seriously had given up by then, and had no choice but to avoid the entire street half a block away from our apartment since we kept seeing him chilling at the same spot with his homies only 7 blocks away from where we sleep at night.

My man is going in for lineup tomorrow, hopefully they even have the right jerkface and I sure as hell hope he gets thrown in prison for assault II but chances are he'll plead out for some stupid community service.

On a different note, the day after my incident, I found out that a very dear friend overdosed and died - heroin, possibly fent. She passed away the same day I was in the ER, and based on her locale, it's likely she was brought to the same ER I was within. Such a feckin' bummer.

We knew each other all throughout school. She was only 2-3 weeks younger than I, but being born in Dec. made it so she was a grade lower. However, we didn't start hanging out until we'd both left high school, in 1997. We became fast friends, and were basically joined at the hip for several years .. Partied, experimented (read: went hard) with so many substances, and traveled all over the place while doing so. After those few years, we grew apart - it happens. Here and there, we'd see one another, and catch up.

Some years passed, and she moved to the left coast, but later on, we found one another on FB, and kept in contact. Back in 2012 or 2013, she moved back into the area .. We talked, with passion, about getting back together to chill, as if no time had passed at all .. It just never happened, and I sort of regret that part.

During one of our more recent chats on the phone, I opened up about my addiction and recovery. She was very cool about it, and fully understood what I'd gone through. She, however, didn't mention anything about her own use. Maybe she wasn't using at that point in time? I have no clue. Just wish she'd opened a line of communication when her use came about. I'm really wishing I could have helped. The past week has been pretty rough. 

Other friends have passed from overdoses, but with this one hitting so especially close to home, I'm feeling a greater urge to assist with our local harm reduction / syringe exchange program. I've already gone through a week-long, 40-hour, class with them; I've just been (selfishly) lazy about attending the final two afternoons of shadowing - after that, I'll be able to carry and distribute supplies within my community. Someone, kick my feckin' ass into gear, please.

An app that is on your phone that you have next to you right before you shoot up. You press it and it counts down say 60 seconds and if you don't push stop it calls 911 or you set it up to text someone you confide in with a message ""call 911 I'm at xxx and just fell out.""

So you get everything ready to shoot up, tie off, then push the button shoot up and if you fall out it calls 911 or texts your predetermined person. But if your shots fine you just stop the count down.

Any thoughts?",1458166984.0

Regrets aside, is there any confirmation as to his status? He asked me to post the self-eulogy today but in the interest of privacy etc. I'd rather have a confirmation of his passing before posting potentially sensitive information.

Really slowed down in my 20s since my teenage/college days though, now I only take party drugs at festivals/raves a few times a year and mainly stick to smoking weed and doing dope, while trying to keep the latter in check. Being on suboxone maintenance keeps me a functional addict, for the most part. I'm on the cycle of clean-> chip -> binge -> chip -> clean, but the longest I've been clean from opiates (not including subs and weed) is about 3 weeks during the past 5 years. Part of that is living in a city flooded by dope and having too much access, but there's another side to it that I've never talked about with anybody but my boyfriend and now you guys.

I have some serious mental health issues stemming from severe childhood abandonment (never knew my mom), neglect (was hungry, cold, and unattended a lot as a kid), physical abuse, and sexual abuse (incest from my dad, which has led to serious internalized misogyny issues). I was also not allowed to socialize as a kid and raised in an extremely repressive, strict, sexist environment. Somehow I earned a full ride through college and have a great job now, and I've dealt with all of this the best I could, I go to counseling, etc...but the truth is that I've been dealing with suicidal ideation my entire life (it started as soon as I was old enough to comprehend what death was), and now, homicidal ideation. Honestly I read psychological profiles of serial killers and it scares me because they all fit me to a tee, like 100%, except that most serial killers are male and I am female (although I hate being female and blame it for many of my problems, and like to do things that make me feel powerful and masculine instead of feminine and weak, like fantasizing about killing women). I think I hate being a woman because we are so weak/easily victimized and because I was victimized as a kid, so I have a strong desire to now be a predator myself instead of the prey. I've never truly acted on any of these thoughts, but sometimes they are overwhelming and I really kind of want to. I try really hard to be a good person, I have a split personality-half of me is very generous, kind, give-you-the-shirt-off-my-back type of person who does volunteer work and donates to charities, but I can also be emotionally abusive in my relationships, and a very cruel and sadistic person. When I see other women walking alone at night and they hear me approaching behind them, they all swivel their heads around and look at me with that look of apprehension in their eyes, but the second they see that I am an attractive young woman, they relax and put their guard back down. And I always think, ""I could totally drag her into an alley and do anything I wanted, with the right preparation and tools."" Then I start thinking about what I would need and how I would buy it, but then I snap out of it and go get some dope and it's all good.

I also discovered I can't be on hormonal birth control-last fall I went back on birth control and the hormones drove me into a psychotic break, I started hearing this serpentine voice inside my head that mocked me and insulted me constantly (expression of my self loathing), when she wasn't telling me to kill myself or someone else. The rage and crazy emotions I went through, I can never go through again. It's also when I started binge using again because the homicidal urges/fantasies were so overwhelming I could barely tell the difference between my thoughts and reality anymore. I also love cats and have one of my own that I dote on, but when I was on birth control a few years prior I am very ashamed to say that I started abusing/torturing my neighbor's cat when she wasn't looking...once I started, I couldn't stop, I could not control myself. I would have tears in my eyes while I was doing it but I just...couldn't stop doing it. Eventually the cat stopped coming outside so that ended thankfully before I killed it. Sometimes I am overcome by guilt for what I did, but then it didn't even feel like I was the one doing it, it honestly felt like I was being possessed by blind rage when it happened. I still know logically I am 100% responsible and the passivity is just my mind's way of coping with the awfulness of it. Both times I stopped taking the birth control and slowly I have been regaining my sanity...and now that I have realized what it does to me, I will never take birth control again.

I am not sure I really NEED dope, I think smoking weed is enough to chill me out most days. I will never be dumb enough to admit any of these thoughts to anyone, so please don't tell me to, I have never been in a psych ward and would like to avoid it. I like to think I am a good person, even though internally I struggle with that everyday-I have never even stolen from anyone or ripped anyone off to feed my habit, although I don't judge anyone who does. I live my life by very strict morals and am constantly thinking about morality and ethics because I fear who I would become if I let that slip even a little-like with my neighbor's cat. But here is the thing. Sometimes I think my options in life are not between a great sober life or one as a drug addict. I think my options are between a sober serial killer or as a drug user who manages it the best she can. Using lets me relax, forget about my horrible childhood (I've been told I may have PTSD), and makes everything OK. When I use I don't feel like I am on the verge of becoming a serial killer. I feel like the Other Me, the way I SHOULD feel-like the person who got a full ride through college, graduated with honors in a STEM major, holds down an amazing job and a side job and a 5 year relationship with the love of my life, parties sometimes, and is about to go to grad school.

I am not sure what I expected from this post. But thank you for reading my rant.

tl;dr: I think I may actually be better off using because it keeps me from possibly becoming a serial killer.",1458148883.0

I've been abusing (snorting) oxycodone since September. I do about 100-150mg a day. My boyfriend is also a user and has had problems in the past however, we both started using again at the same time. We both want to quit badly. I recently got health insurance through work. I found a doctor who prescribes suboxone, checked to make sure my insurance covers it, and it does. Everything is starting to go alright. 

My question here is, should I lie about how much I do so he prescribes me a higher dose so I can share with my boyfriend? He can't afford to go to the doctor without insurance right now and i want us to stop using at the same time. We live together so it would be too much for me to be around it. I told him I would share my prescription with him, but I'm worried the doctor light prescribe a low dose because I am pretty small. I'm 5'4"" and 110ish pounds. Not sure if my size makes a difference or not. I would love for him to start me at 16mg, so we can each start at 8mg of suboxone daily. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I could do this? I'm not going to tell my doctor my boyfriend is a user. 

Also, random question about this. My first appointment they will not be prescribing anything at all. My second appointment is when I will get my prescription because they need to get prior authorization from my insurance. When I go in for the first appointment, do I need to be withdrawing? I have to work all week and I wanted to wait until the weekend after I get my prescription so I don't have to withdraw at work for the 12-24 hours. 

Sorry it's so much, but I would appreciate your guys help so much! Thanks. 

Tl;dr - I need to share my script of subs with my boyfriend. How can I be sure to get prescribe 16mg or more? Also, do I need to be in withdrawal for first appointment if he isn't prescribing anything until the 2nd appointment? ",1458291315.0

I just hung out with a close friend and my girlfriend. But I can't connect with other people, even the people who are close to me. I don't understood the social world -- how people go out to drink amongst friends today and laugh. It feels very disingenuous and devoid of meaning. I feel a more appropriate reaction would be to panic. To go meet people for a gathering and be scared together. Discuss anxiety, depression, and the existential angst. Those feelings seem much more pressing to me. How can others not feel this way? Or why can't we discuss trust? How can we trust others? All of us are self-interested, prone to mistakes, irrationality, and cruel behavior and intentions. We all live individual lives which very much resemble a world unto itself. How could I trust you to want to listen to me or to do what is best for or to know what is best for me? You can't approach your own life with any rationality. You will either take advantage of me or hurt me. But if I am to suffer a horrible fate or death, I am the only person who will feel the pain so intimately. To others, my death will be justified, become a part of their narrative. They will find a way to fit my death into their comprehension of the world, their ideology, as I do with the fate and lives of so many others. Even though we are so interconnected, we are world's apart. Forever separate... distant from others and to ourselves.

This, I realize, is self-indulgent, teen-like angst. I thought I was through with my existential fascination. But whenever I feel like I strike something genuine... a genuine description of what existence is for me it resembles this empty vision and the feelings attached to it.

Opiates sooth me. They take away these unwanted feelings and thoughts. They distract me. I need some guidance, I feel way to lost. I can trust heroin.",1458273410.0

The obvious factors include a skyrocketing tolerance leading to people having $300+ a day habits (thanks DEA!), along with the fact that heroin is both significantly cheaper and marginally more potent than many prescription opioids.

In my situation right now, I take between 60-120mg of oxycodone a day usually Roxy 30s, but the dose to get me ""high"" is slowly creeping up and up to the point where I have been adding a few 4mg hydromorphone (Dilaudid) on top of this, and I'll get high for a little while but not really close to what I used to feel. 

I remember the good old days where half a blue (roxicodone 30mg), so 15mg of oxycodone would have me nodding, but now I'll eat 30mg and insufflate 30mg at the same time, and I'll feel great (of course) but there's almost no nod whatsoever. Only from single doses of 90+mg do I actually start to feel the nod.

My questions to you guys on r/opiates are:

1. Did you make the switch to heroin after using prescription opioids? If so, what were your main reasons?

2. What dosage were you on and with what opioid at the point that you decided to switch? And if you have not switched, what is your current daily opioid consumption? If you have, how much H do you use per day and what is your preferred route of administration?

3. Is your addiction to opioids sustainable financially? Are you able to show up for your life while maintaining your habit?

People addicted to pills either now or in the past, have you or are you considering switching to heroin? If so, why or why not?",1458256217.0

4avdto,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4avdto/er_opana/,7,https://redd.it/4avdto,ayyKaraA,ER Opana,"Hi all- 
I normally bang ER opana. It is my DOC. My usual connections have either the 40mg yellow, 30mg red, or 20mg green pans. The yellows being my preference. I normally cut the yellows into quarters and shoot 1/4 of the pill at once. That's my standard dose currently but if I'm looking for an extra rush I'll bang 20mg or half the pill. 
Anyways... Today I came across an old friend with a script of light orange 10mg opana ER's. (The same as the yellows, reds, and greens just 10mg version that is orange in color). I had never come across these before. They are  NOT like the g series pans (Orange in color g74s that are 40mgs and g77s which are 30mg and the same orange color- these are the only gs I've come across I'm sure there's other strengths out there as well). Originally before I saw these pans I thought that's which ones they must be- the g series that you use alcohol extraction to bang. 
To clarify the 10s I have are NOT the g series. They are the same as the ""e"" series. 
Anyways if any of you have dealt with these e series pans often you know that getting more than half of one of these pills to fit into one rig is extremely difficult-especially without the liquid being so thick to clog the rig. It is very unfortunate that they make the 40mg pills the same physical size as the 30,20, and 10mg ones- only altered by adding more filler for the reduction in mgs is my assumption. 
So after this long winded (probably over) explanation if you couldn't guess already my question to all of you is this-
Does anyone have any advice or method for getting an entire ER (or ideally even 2 entire ER pills since I have an entire script to play with) loaded into one rig efficiently? ",1458252277.0

Since I relapsed last September I have legitimately AMA'd from thirteen treatment centers, which seriously has to be some kind of record. After years of forging checks from my parents I suppose they smartened up enough to put a hold on their account. Needless to say, the manager calls my fucking mom and I calmly walk out and got away fine. 
My parents give me the age-old ""go to fucking rehab or we're calling the cops on you"" bullshit. At least this time I get to go to CA, which seems like a pretty sweet state. 
I really hope that I am able to force myself to stay past day one of detox but they really aren't lying when they say it gets harder every time. I've been living in some 50 year old dude's basement since December when I stopped working. (I am a 24 year old female). Luckily he is actually super chill and buys me free dope almost everyday and looks for nothing in return. However, he's been having money troubles recently As well so I'm just stuck in a perpetual circle of dope sickness and shit never working out. 
Even worse, my tolerance is so high that I hardly even feel it, which is seriously the most depressing form of heroin addiction...just using to take away the sickness. 
I recently lost my best dealer in Paterson that had shit seriously twice as strong as everyone else so I guess now is not he worst time to get clean. I need to do it before I commit suicide. I really so not think I have ever been this depressed in my entire life and that is really saying a lot. 
As gift  before rehab my friend gave me three NY bags Along with 7+ Shitty Paterson bags and guess what the outcome was? Not only did I actually feel it, but I nodded out for the first time in probably over six months. I cannot even describe the level of happiness I am feeling right now. What a perfect ending to my last day of freedom. 

 TL;DR: going to rehab in CA tomorrow and spent my last free night nodding out in the shower after not actually being able to get high for months. 

How is that heroin is my beat friend and my worst enemy? cAN'T LIVE WITH IT, CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT IT!

 For some very stupid reason I decided to bail on my methadone maintenance. I've been on 100mg a day for about 6 months now, and decided to just up and leave, and use my old drug of choice (IV H) to cope with the withdrawls.
 Well, my money is gone, the withdrawls are still there. I haven't slept in a week, and I crawled back to the clinic like a fool.
 I've been on 30mg methadone a day for the past two days. Dosing at 5am because I didn't sleep through the night, coming home and finally resting til I wake up around noon, feeling like absolute shit again. I feel like I'm driving everyone around me, and myself, completely insane with this, and I just want to it to go away. 
 I'm considering selling my car just to buy some shit to keep me sane. 

 Restless legs are the worst. I can't seem to take my mind off of it. I walk around, I drive around, I hang out with my girlfriend. Nothing works. All I can think about is the drug, and it's making me feel absolutely psychotic!  

 What helps? What should I do? I can see how this can turn a normal person into a criminal. I feel like I'm losing it. ",1458349140.0

Word is that it can be used to keep down tolerance, quite successfully too...and even potentiate your DOC! Does anyone have any experience using it for these purposes? 
I know it can be somewhat risky, as it throws whatever opiates you are taking off of your brain's receptors. Do folks use it on days they are not using, or take it before their doses? I imagine after you dose, even 10mg will shock your system causing withdrawals, so the key seems like small does and timing. Would it work to use naltrexone during my breaks from opiates to ""clean"" my receptors and bring my tolerance back to base?

Anyhow, It'd be great to work on keeping my tolerance lower, saving bread and perhaps making withdrawals lighter. Really curious about this, thank you guys 8)",1458347538.0

After a short, but successful rehab, Suboxone, doctors, psychologists and counselors, I've been clean for a while.

Really I've been clean 3 months, but not *technically* since I used 3 times in that first month, so I just say 2 months.

I've been doing okay, but every night I just dream about shooting some dope. The Suboxone really helps with my cravings (and eliminating WD's if you're coming off). I take either 16-32mg and my god does the film taste bad.

But yeah, it's working great. I'm going to stay on it for a while. But I know I will use again. I have a feeling next week I'm gonna buy a small amount to last a couple days.

I have a urine test in 40 days, you reckon my piss will be completely free or morphine in 25 days? When I say free, I mean completely free of morphine..like not even a hint of morphine..like 0.00%?

It usually clears in 4 days according to most people and I have a fast metabolism, but once I failed a test after 8 days and it blew my mind!

I don't get into serious trouble, but it might be a conversation to avoid, I have a completely open relationship with my main doctor and psychologist though.

Just had to get that off my chest.

It feels good to be in control though. I don't think rehab helped me at all...like the only thing stopping me from shooting up every day is Suboxone.

I could ride these out standing on my head if I had a few more days off work, but tomorrow I'm going back to my job where I was recently promoted to a very high stress position that is very fast paced. Something like lope: does that only help take bad withdrawal down to mild, or will it be just as effective taking mild down to none?

Small copping story at the end.,"We all know everyone hates the rls /insomnia, the shits, and the sweats the most. But what about the minor symptoms? For me I think it's the fact that I can smell things so much better than if I was on opioids. But the tunnel vision and my reduced ability to focus are also fucking annoying.

When I'm on a really rough binge, I wont get out of bed for two days sometimes and I'll smoke cigarettes like a chimney. I use a mason jar with water in it as an ashtray and I usually stuff it completely full on those two day binges easily. Honestly I can't even smell it while I'm high. But as soon as I start to withdrawal, the smell of that putrid black water makes me want to gag. 

The tunnel vision is probably my only dangerous withdrawal symptom. For example, my best dealer hasn't been feeling good. She turned her phone off to avoid being woken up in the middle of the night by me wanting pills. So I had to wait an extra nine hours to get my fix. Well when she finally hits me up just about 30mins ago and I'm driving to her place all is well until out of nowhere this MASSIVE fucking bird flys up from the road and misses my car by a couple of inches.

But it won't be my last. I'm excited by the prospect of getting to know some of you better! So I've decided to take the plunge into reddit/r/opiates, because reading these threads recently has taught me a hell of a lot. Lately, I haven't even been going to Reddits front page - I come straight here, where I find comfort. Comfort in reading about your stories, your shared experiences. Your trials & tribulations. Even just about your day in general! I suddenly feel like a can relate to many of you, when only 3 months ago - that was not the case. Honestly, 3 months ago I was a different person. You might not know me, but, I want you to know you have helped me. I sincerely want to thank you for that. 

I'm from Melbourne, Australia. I'm 30, single & currently living with my parents - Hmm, not off to a great start here! Hahah, luckily for me - I have a great relationship with my family that comes from love. And, It's a ridiculously large place. A mansion, technically. . So we don't get in each other's way. Like, at all... It's funny, Sometimes, a whole day can go by without ever having seen each other... It's also only 2 blocks from work, which is great. I suppose.. if I had a girlfriend, I'd get my own place. But for now I'm happy right where I am. 

Now, I need to get this off my chest, because the reality is that it's becoming a very serious problem and the main driving force in my life of late. I've never admitted this before to anyone,myself included. But, honestly, I'm terrified. So I'd love a little advice from anyone willing to give it - please. I'm all ears! I know it's a long and somewhat depressing fist post - sorry about that. But to me it doesn't feel that way at all. To me, just writing honestly about myself is helpful and, even though it reads like a damn cleche.. Im still proud of myself for posting this.

It all started with a runny nose. Of course a runny nose is nothing to complain about really.. But... Right away, I knew this was different. The god damn thing was just leaking - like a faucet that was not turned off properly. I was blowing my nose every 3 to 4 seconds.. Frustrating when it's 9 am, and your going over  phone contracts with customers at work. By 9:30 - it's progressed to a real, all-over lethargy, with waves of sheer exhaustion washing over me - and I'm starting to break a sweat. Which of course went straight from 'breaking' a sweat to the most badass fuckin sweat I've ever sweat! Lol, without even moving - just sitting at my computer. I went from dry to soaked - from head to toe, literally. 

Jesus fucken Christ! I thought - I've caught a real motherfucker of a cold here! It's coming on fast. I can feel myself going downhill by the minute! Works gonna suck even harder than usual today.. Great!

As you've already guessed. There was no cold. For the first time in my life, I was about to experience a dope sickness - of sorts. I've never actually tried heroin, so I guess I wasn't DOPE sick. But I was definitely going through opiate withdrawal, and it was brutal. And at this moment in time I honestly had no idea! Hahah, had I known what was coming my way that day (now roughly 2months ago) - well, I guess I'd have called in sick. 

So here it is. I've been abusing fentanyl in a nasal spray prep for roughly 3 months now. Before which, I had never touched an opiate beyond that of OTC codeine before. I'm certainly no stranger to drugs in general though. Love em mostly:) I smoke weed pretty regularly, if not every day. Though never at work. Even though my job sucks balls, I like being sober and switched on a lot more than being high on drugs when I have to communicate with people all day long trying to convince them to sign contracts and spend money. But, when it's party time, often included are the usual suspects; coke, speed, meth, molly, booze etc.. Whatever comes by.. 

But lately, I've been in love with a little nasal spray bottle that contains 4ml of a fentanyl solution inside. Like all my drugs of the last 5 or 6 years - I purchase it from the dark web markets. And each 4ml bottle costs exactly $140 aussie dollars. I always wanted to try opiates. But I'd heard heroin would be largely disappointing an experience unless you were willing to iv. Which I wasn't. In Australia, there weren't very many other opiates for sale on the dark web. There's no listings at all for drugs you guys talk about like hydrocodone, Percocet, Vicodin, morphine etc... Oxycodone must be rare in this country or something? Because the prices are so high, it's insane! Like a 5mg oxy is $30 per tablet. I recall seeing some 80mg time release ones that were over $300 each.. In retrospect, i should have bought the oxy, feeling ripped of right from the start is a great deterrent to keep you from doing it again. Its hard to GET addicted to something that you have no money to buy more of... less danger. But, once you ARE addicted - I'm finding that even though I'm now flat broke. (With ever-rising credit card debt)I'm still getting more. Somehow.. One way or another, good (rarely) or bad, once your hooked - you just find a way. I'm still yet to try oxy too! or any other opiate, besides fentanyl.

Now, When I first started using. One spray would almost floor me - particularly if I had a few beers/joints in me, which there always is once I knock off for the day. I loved how about 3-4 minutes after a single spray - I just oozed into that subtle feeling fucking great all over. I now totally understand why people abuse opiates... It's a straight up love affair. Feeling fucking warm and fuzzy and safe and happy and itchy in a way that weirdly feels so great to scratch. Hopefully I'm under the covers. its raining outside with my favorite movie/TV series  -and some junk food and ahhhhhhhhhhhhahahah. Just doing that now is one of lifes greatest pleasures. Anyways, my point was - to get that feeling, all it took was one spray, and I was off to that land of nod I hear you all talk so fondly of :) Then wake up, off to work. Take care of life n stuff. Rinse and repeat. A bottle has roughly 20 - 25 sprays in it so at this rate one would last at least a week. So my bank account was happy. And obviously so was I..honestly, when I first started taking it, I remember thinking, wow! Is this how other people feel all the time? Maybe I actually should genuinely be prescribed it! I felt more relaxed and mellow, with less anxiety towards people, to even just liking people a bit more in general. So long as I didn't overdo it - I could feel that way and not look drunk or slow/sloppy or on the nod. Totally cool, calm and happy. Haha! Looking back, I was just high... Very naive, and very high. after 2-3 weeks or so one spray was no longer enough to get me where I wanted to be. I now needed two or three sprays. This went on for another month. Up until this point it still kinda felt like I'd only just met the drug. Still in the 'honeymoon' phase. The price was right  - but now, I needed two or three sprays (or doses) not once but two or even three times in a single night. Thus, the bottle is now barely lasting four days, so I decide to give it a rest. I cant justify spending $280 or more a week on drugs on what I earn. 

So, I finish off the bottle that night - with at least 3 or 4 more doses than I usually did - as a kind of farewell, honeymoons over, it was a great ride kind of attitude. Good times. I understood that needing to take more than before, meant that my body was becoming used to having the drug and thus developing tolerance. So giving it up was a good idea. BUT, I just had no idea, the implications of this with regards to opiates... I didn't know what I'd actually done to myself yet!

The day it was work as usual, no problem - came home to No fentanyl for the first time in a couple of months. No problem. feel just fine. I stupidly was expecting a type of hangover or comedown the next day, and I didn't even get that! I feel great really! Few beers and a big spliff and it's off too sleep. Really, I was actually about to enter a World. Of. Shit. I mean, I had only been using for a couple months after all. Sure, it was most, if not all days  - but never ALL day. Like booze & weed - i was using it to relax after a long day of being active and sober. I had had 2 nights of deep, wonderful sleep and felt great since my last dose. But as I said at the start of this rant. The next day was bad. 

My god. I can only imagine what a full blown heroin addict must go through when they stop cold turkey.. In the space of only a few hours, I felt worse than I've ever felt from any cold or flu that's for damn sure! 
Couldn't make it the whole day.. By about 2 o clock I was puking and shitting, at the same time - hahah, man that had to be just horrific for the poor bastard that walked into the cubicle next to me. Despite the sounds of an exorcism coming from my cubicle, I never heard a peep from the poor guy. Luckily in the bathroom at work, the divider goes all the way down, otherwise he might have seen me lying on a piss soaked ground while I kept my head in the toilet, occasionally alternating which end pointed at the bowl... I got the fuck outta there the second I felt able to move. Couldn't even speak to the boss, just ran outta the place & got home as fast as I could. Unfortunately, having to travel 2 blocks without shitting myself could not be done... But I made it home - to a shower. Everything hurts. Right through me - to my very bones. I remember even lightly touching/moving the hairs on my arms caused intense, agonizing pain. After crawling into bed to slowly try and come to terms with the fact that this felt like it was only just beginning. And it was. The next symptom wanted to meet me! Restless leg syndrome... Something I'd never once had before that day. It of course made falling asleep impossible, so the next 3 days wont be anything but excruciating. Because even though I could just order more fentanyl with a few mouse clicks - it would take 3 days to arrive through the post. With that in mind, I still ordered more anyway... Which was a huge mistake, because by the time it arrived - I was actually starting to feel just a bit better! I mean, I still felt fucking awful! - but it was actually starting to feel like the worst part might almost be over. The last few days were pure fucking hell, but another day or two and i might have been free and clear of it completely. But, once that bottle was in my hands - while I still felt just fucking horrible, and had for the last 3 sleepless nights.. Well, I just couldn't resist. Feeling that way, all I could see the situation as was 'I'm sick, and in my hand is the cure'. Plus, I had now taken 3 impromptu sick days off work and taking more wouldn't look good. I remember, It blew me away just how quickly it took me, from that full on sickness, to feeling better - to normal, to just fiiiine! From one end of the spectrum, all the way across to the other - in roughly 3 to 7 minutes. 

Since that day, another month or two has gone by. And I've been doing everything I can think of (besides stopping of course) to make sure I don't go through that pain ever again. Unfortunately, my usage has also skyrocketed since that time. I am now dosing once right as I get to work, once at lunch and sometimes another around 4 o clock... Then once I'm home it's business as usual. Few beers/joints and 3 or 4 sometimes 5 more doses, and with that my bed then magically transforms into a womb. 

I now need a dose every 4 hours or so. It's just to say well. I can no longer do a whole day at work without it - if I try, the sweating starts by lunchtime and it only get worse from there, and quickly. At least being a nasal spray, it's super easy to dose anywhere. I don't have to carry and conceal and constantly worry about crack pipes or needles or whatever... There's no baggies or lighters or spoons and all the other bits and pieces that come with having to facilitate a drug addiction. It's just so easy, so simple.

But, that is really about the only positive I've got left here... I need at least 3 bottles a week now, costing me at least $420. Which on my pay - is unsustainable. I can't keep this up for long at all - and believe me, I don't want to! I know I'm not psychologically hooked. Not yet at least - as much as I enjoy the feeling, if It didn't make me sick the next day - I would flush whatever I've got left right now while crying tears of joy. Now with that in mind - I'd love some advice with regards to stopping. I've studied the withdrawal survival guide offered here and will get some things from that list next week. Once I have what i need, I will start a planned taper down with the drug that I'm thinking should span roughly 3 weeks. By the end of which I hope to be only having one to two doses a day before jumping off the drug completely. This is where I'm really in the dark guys. Do you think it's possible to taper off to a point where once I stop completely, I'll have only a few days of feeling withdrawal symptoms? If I knew roughly how long I'll be wrecked for - I could better time my absence from work.  Take say - 3 days off, with the weekend giving me 5 days to recover - would it be enough? Is tapering off with fentanyl even possible? Or, am I setting myself up for failure. I have no illusions about the fact that even with a perfect plan to ween off the drug - I'm going to feel it. It's coming for me. There's no way around it, and I accept that. I have no one to blame for this situation but myself. And I know the longer I put it off, the harder it will become. Both physically and mentally, and of course financially. 

I've also considered simply going to the doctor and just explaining all this to them. Is that a good idea? Could they assist me in any way? Perhaps help me create a plan. What about suboxone treatment? Am I in deep enough to warrant that? Or, will they just tell me to suck it up? I have no idea here guys. It's all new to me. I do know they could at least provide me with a doctors certificate to buy me another few days off work no questions asked. 

Ok, I guess that about does wraps it up. It's now Sunday arvo, so I'm going to get behind my drum kit - turn up the stereo, and make music till my fingers bleed. Thanks again for reading my rant. If you could offer me your thoughts on my plans to be rid of opiates entirely in a month or so. You'd be helping me immensely & I'd really appreciate it. Seriously guys. If reddit were a bar, I'd buy you all a round :)

I've been addicted to opiate's for 11 years now. Mostly prescription opiates, but started doing heroin recently. I hadn't had an opiate in my system for over a year, but unfortunately I started again. Mostly it was due to incarceration. 

I have been chipping for the last month, only using once a week, twice at most. It seems to be alright (it isn't alright). But it has reached the point where my nose is always running, I'm always yawning, I have that anxious restless feeling.... Keep in mind, I have been chipping, never using more than twice a week, usually only once. But it is driving me nuts. The beast is just sitting there, waiting to rage and get strung out. It is the way it always is.

Luckily, I live out in the country, don't have a car and there is no way to use more than what I am right now. Thank god, I guess.

There is that, and then there is the fact that closest friend is basically a douche bag when she/he is using. Super stingy, super paranoid. No fun basically. She/He has managed to get super strung out. She/he has no problem splitting points with me after I pay for it all, but oh god, the moment that I am the one in need, they freak the fuck out ""dude you are totally being ungrateful for what I do for you""... the typical guilt trip. 

Anyways, been really fucking irritated lately and needed to vent. It doesn't help that the past couple of times I have gotten some dope, I have managed to register, yet still miss. I don't fuckin get it either, I've been shooting for 7 years, yet this keeps happening. I think it has to do with the fact that I am prescribed lithium and I shake. :(

As a fellow lover of opiates, I thought it was only right that my first post be about opiates so I thought I'd share my recent experience with poppy seed tea.

While there are certainly a number of posts regarding poppy seed tea as well as being someone who dislikes beating a dead horse as much as anyone, I thought maybe my recent experience might be helpful to others, or at the very least somethings to give you guys to read for a few minutes.

I'll start by giving you a quick background about myself and career with opiates. I have done oxycodone, OxyContin, Percocet, Diaulid, Morphine, codiene, Tramodol, Suboxone, and east coast US powder heroin with my drug of choice being the heroin or Oxycodone (30s) if I can't find any brown. I've been on 3-4 mg of Suboxone over the last 9 months with occasional heroin use (2-3 times a month) when I can afford and find it.

I would say I have a fairly solid size tolerance right now between the Subs, Dope, and roughly 7 years of use. When I use Oxy, it takes 90-120 mg to get a decent buzz and nod going while .3-.5 f dope to do the same as well. So again, not the craziest habit but a habit none the less.

After much research, reading, and pondering I finally decided to get myself some poppy seeds after a week of trying to obtain some dope from my guy who is currently dry due to some recent arrests with his higher up connects. I'm not going to lie, I was very skeptical going into this experiment with the seeds.

After much research and reading review after review of seeds online, I finally made a move. The seeds I got were from a popular online market whose seed vendor was very Sincere with dealing with me. I ordered 10 pounds (2 bags) of these tiny, black poppy seeds and received them 2 days later via mail. 

I followed the directions provided alone and listened to other's tips on the making of poppy seed tea and was pretty surprised at the level of success I had. My first batch of seeds was about 1.5 pounds shaked over the course of 5 minutes in a 2 liter bottle filled with a combination of seeds, lemonade, and water.

The end result was a murky yellow liquid that tasted absolutely awful. It came out to roughly 12 ounces of this foul tasting substance. It's effects took about 45 minutes to come on for me and seemed to get stronger as time went on. Towards the end of the night (4-5 hours after initial dose), I actually had a decent nod going on. Overall I was quite pleased with its effects and would compare it .2-.3 of brown or roughly 100-120 mg of Oxy. 

The next day, I decided to try again using the same process except I used roughly 3 pounds this time around. I managed about 16 ounces of an even murkier yellow substance that I believed was better prepared and concentrated than my first batch of tea. I drank the liquid over the course of about 75 minutes. Once again, I was left with a pretty impressive high from the tea and would compare it to about .4-.6 of brown or 150 mg of Oxy taken over the course of a evening.

All and all, I was pretty happy with the results and would defiantly recommend everyone to give it a try at least once. My advice would be to anyone interested to do their research on preparation, potential risks involved, and to read through customer reviews of seeds placing an emphasis on the date of the reviews as it seems like the seeds/batches can vary not only between brands but with batches as well. This industry seems to at times have product droughts and inconsistencies in strength.

My understanding is that seeds can vary quite a bit in potency so please be careful with dosing in addition to doing your research into seeds, methods of preparations, companies, and recent trends. I would recommend starting small and working your way up especially if one has little to no tolerance to opiates. 

The most important aspect of making PST is obvisouly the seeds themselves so I cannot stress enough doing your research and reading reviews. You want to make sure you are getting unwashed seeds with little to no chemicals or pesticides added. Many vendors sell seeds labeled unwashed that are weak in potency so this is why research and reviews are so critical.  

My only other warnings are that because the tea and seeds contain opiates such as morphine and codiene within them, it is thus possible to fail a drug test after consuming the seeds just like one would after doing heroin, Oxy, or any other opiate/opiod. Also, the taste of the tea is pretty bad and the process of preparing the tea can get a little messy so make sure you're prepared!

At the end of the day, I would defiantly recommend giving PST a shot, whether it be as a result of curiosity, withdrawal, or simply a good old nod. If anyone else here wants to share their experiences or some tips about PST, I'd love to hear them.

Thanks for having me and listening guys, this sub always seemed like a community of good people with a good sense of humor and big hearts. Take it easy guys and girls, happy nods!

Edit: Apologize for the novel of text guys, I just wanted to give as best of a report as possible for anyone who might be like how I was a few days ago reading post after post about PST so hopefully this post will serve a purpose and answer any questions about PST. ",1458424755.0

My question is, how much, considering my current codeine habit would you recommend dosing?

Hes a great guy and hes not a crook that asks for 280$ per visit like 99% of other doctors, he just charges a 15 co pay. Im grateful he took me back, he said he has never taken a single patient back, but I showed up at his office for a ""check up"" and if he knew it was to try to get back on the program he would of denied me, so I am extremely grateful.

Another thing im grateful for, apparently he worked some magic and Im going to be getting the suboxone strips instead of the shitty nasty ass generic pills that I used to get. So, if all is well, why would i be disappointed?

Well with a mix up with insurance, and since its saturday, he was going to prescribe me 6 subutex's until we could call and figure out what was going on with my insurance on monday, but the stupid fat bitch secretary pops in and says ""hes covered""

So I get the script for suboxone films, and go to the pharmacy, and it needs to get authorized by the doctor and they are closed until monday...

So, even though all is well, and I'll be getting sub films no problem, I'm a tad bit sad because I really wanted to try out subutex, and im without medication until monday.

Sorry for this shitpost, but anyways, all is well, I was just so close to trying out subutex, but instead end up with nothing until monday, however, I could've ended up with nothing ever, so I am extremely grateful for insurance, good doctors, coupons, and a 2nd chance back at a normal life.

For me, if I wake up any time past about 5:30-6:00am, there's just about *no* way my mind will let me go back to sleep, regardless of when I actually have to be up. This is because I know I have a nice chunk of black sitting in the drawer saved from the night before.  I almost always make sure if I'm about to run out of dope, I save the biggest chunk for the next morning dose. My morning shot is always bigger than the one(s) I did the night before. Now, knowing that is waiting for me, I just can't go back to sleep. I really wish I was less antsy and more patient because it really makes a difference on when I start to feel shitty and fiend later in the afternoon/evening.

Anyway, I *fucking love* this morning shot. I keep everything in a drawer right next to my bed with my laptop/desk in reach of my bed as well. So my morning ritual is to make sure I take care of bathroom business, as we all know, ya gotta seize the opportunity to take a nice shit whenever ya can. Which for me is usually only in the morning unless I'm dopesick. Anyway, after that is done, I come back, sit on my bed, flip on the lamp next to me, then reach over and put on Sublime / Bradley and friends acoustic album. Then I *promptly* cook up a beautiful shot right there on my nightstand where I keep my kit. Then I'll do about 20 jumping jacks, sit down and wipe my spot with a prep pad, then tie off.

 As soon as I tie off, I usually put on acoustic ""pool shark"". My favorite song to shoot dope to. I usually have no problems hitting in the morning after the jumping jacks. So I quickly register, untie, then push that plunger down to bring me my happiness. If I'm gonna get a nice rush with my tolerance, it's gonna be from one of these fat morning shots. I clean up, then usually go straight out for a morning smoke. 

Early mornings are so beautiful. I sit out there, freshly loaded with my favorite drug, just thinking to myself how perfect this is, usually knowing in the back of my head that there's a 50/50 chance that I just had my last fix until tonight or maybe not even until the next day. I never really know for sure when I'm gonna have some more dope, which as a physically dependant user can be very stressful. 

So, at that moment, everything is OK. I've just had what I need. I can sit and smoke, looking up at the bright moon and soon-fading stars in the dimly lit early sky at peace knowing I will be feeling nice today. 

*But in the back of my head I know I'm like one of those stars, bright and happy now but slowly fading away into the brightening sky around me, unknowing as to whether or not I will come back bright again that night, or if it will be cloudy and I won't shine at all.*

My friend doesn't Reddit, so I thought that I'd ask you guys a question. It's MESSED UP shit but certainly this has happened before to someone?

My friend got pulled over for speeding. Upon police questioning (who were really nice BTW) he told them that yes, there were drugs in the car (H) and there were also needles (securely locked in a $25 lockbox.)

The cops took him to jail and impounded his car. They are actually keeping this 25-year-old POS Jeep under asset forfeiture laws!

A few weeks before this, he was involved in a DUI (substance was CLAM and that confused the HELL out of the lab!) and I believe that a condition of the DUI bond was to not drink or use drugs--at least until the matter was settled in court.

Anyhow, he spends a night in jail. The day of his release the bond stated that he was NOT to use drugs--specifically opiates. Now, he's a CPP so he just figured why not, I'm gonna finish the 3 bags that I have at home! Since he's a legit CPP, they're gonna find opis (specifically Oxy) in his body anyhow right?

Later on that day I tell him about 6-MAA and that they can, indeed, differentiate H from Oxy as one is made from thebaine and contains no morphine or morphine metabolites like H would.

He used on Monday 7 days ago. He was able to push the whiz quiz until Thursday afternoon and, in that time, he diluted like mad and took b vitamins so the flushing wouldn't be obvious.

He has court this morning. Do you think that he passed and, if not, is he headed off to the pokey?

PS-I think that I know the answer--just asking for him.

Hello, new here, so sorry if this post is stupid. First, a little bit of backstory i guess. I have considerable spine and nerve damage, and for a little over 3 years received regular prescriptions for 5 mg percs, which eventually turned into 15, and then 30, and then dilaudid, 4s, usually coupled with gabapentin (usually helped a bit) or tramadal (never really helped with pain that much, but definitely helped me... relax i suppose enough to fall asleep for an entire night, which has been a very rare occurrence for me for the past 4 or 5 years. anyways, i got picked up on a charge of carrying prescription pills in a non-prescription container (little baggie, which i get is suspicious, but I hated the rattle of the bottles) and then the next time I went to refill my prescription they gave me naproxen, which doesn't do shit obviously, or i'd just take OTC NSAIDS instead. save money, and time. I suppose  my main question is how would i begin looking for something like this? nothing too strong, I don't want anything like H, or even dilaudid (honestly, it made me feel more sick than anything) I've tried kratom to little success. honestly, it helps a bit, but it's so expensive compared to pills, especially when you consider how little of an effect it has compared to actual prescriptions. I've had a lidocaine shot once, which was really helpful, would that be a good idea to try and get more often? I got that from my father, he has a host of things for MS pains, although obviously i'm not going to ask my father for narcotics, as that would be ridiculous. TL:DR got taken off my prescription narcotics against my wishes, what route to take from here? don't want to get high, I'm in legitimate pain most days, and don't sleep worth shit.

Holy shit, i forgot how absolutely fucking miserable that shit is.  Maybe im getting old now? im 25.  Maybe it was the pods?  I had plenty of time to think about it while pissing shit water out my ass, vomiting/dry heaving my guts outs every 30 minutes for 3 days, and leaking urine out of my dick with no sensation whatsoever every time i thought i had to diarrea.  I even shit my bed!  Barely any sleep, no food at all for 3 entire days (the thought of it made me sick), dripping sweat while shivering uncontrollably.  ""he needs more blankets AND less blankets!"" from Tropic Thunder was always on my mind but i failed to see much humor in it at the time.....I lost a good friend to an rc opiate od on January 21st of this year...went pretty hard after that on Fentanyl, oxys, and pod tea....then St.Patricks day, it was the ultimate day of hell for me.  I was pretty good at keeping myself in line before i lost my friend.  After that...the time between dosing got much shorter, until literally all i was doing was nodding and redosing...maybe i intentionally ran out, i've got a good girlfriend, and 3 good dogs counting on me for a good life.  Saving money and maintaining that high did not really go together, and im trying do some traveling before i get any older.  My friend is gone, and there is no amount of opiate in the world that will bring him back.  My monthly oxy re up day is about the 19th, i texted dude and told him not to let me have any.  Another friend chimed in with a bag of pods that he actually owed me, i turned him down.  I made it.  Holy shit, i am so glad that's over.             

 To anybody going through withdrawls, desperate for any relief, these are the things that helped me maintain sanity and hope to see the other side.   If you don't already have substance abuse on your medical record, Go to a fucking walk in clinic and tell them you're sick with the a hardcore flu, they will give you ""Ondansetron ODT 4mg tablets"" (generic, i aint got insurence)  That will keep you from vomiting.  Then beg (or wait, i asked repeatedly) for a Saline drip, this will hydrate you and help with your aches/cramps.  I swear i got a short natural high when that shit finally went into me! It felt soooo good.  After i got home, it all started coming back.  I took 1 advil pill every 5-6 hours with the Ondansetron pills they prescribed and sipping coconut water and gatorade through a pinched straw as much as i could.  What a fucking difference!  Never tell a medical professional you've abused anything, you wont get so lucky.  Hope this helps somebody.

I have mild ocd. It doesnt hinders me that much in my daily life. I have to check water taps, the stove and the door. In normal i can just force myself to check it only once and after some seconds being nervous iam fine but when iam on opiates it really stresses me to not check it over and over again. Sometimes i dont want to go to the bathroom when i have to because i know i will be in there for 10 minutes watching the sink telling myself ""its turned off. it wont turn on by itself. i can go now"". If i just ignore it and go out the nervous feeling wont disappear as usual. All i wanna do is lay in my bed and enjoy being high but i just cant stop thinking about the bathroom being flooded.

Ive already taken it this morning and feel perhaps a bit of more energy. Anyway I noticed my pupils are super dilated. I was reading on a suboxone forum that generally there are no interactions and people generally have positive results from taking these two medications but one post threw me off. Someone claimed that anti-depressants caused them metabolize their subs waaaay faster. Like in 6 hours. I know nothing about pharmacology besides a lay person's understanding of how opiates and subs work. However,  even to my ignorance this sounds impossible. Am I wrong?  I dont feel any withdrawal effects but my eyes look like Im sick....just wondering if someone could comment on these two medication being taken together.

One user trying to change his opinion of subs, another just saying to be careful, as trams can cause seizures. The most helpful was a person saying they use tram to hold off WD between H hits.

My question is if I take a 50 mg tram now, will it help me to not feel like complete shit? I don't want enough to get me high, but if I try this, will it just push my WD back a few hours, causing it to come back just as bad, or would the mild opiate be a minor taper to relieve some pain?

Thank you everyone for the information, huge help. I ended up not taking the trams as I am trying to quit and not just hold off until the next fix. I'm already over 48 hours in and taking the trams now, just to have to experience WD again in a few days doesn't seem worthwhile enough.

I had a hard upbringing, and I've been depressed and socially isolated since childhood. I'm already living like an addict every day with constant porn, games, and web-browsing to feel ""okay"". My social skills and personality are obviously a mess, to the point that every interaction I have I need to use 100% of my brain just to say anything and its always awkward as fuck. As an awkward unattractive mid-twenties guy, catching up to my peers socially at this point seems... unlikely. But still I try because of the emptiness I feel.

I'm considering the opiate route because a few weeks ago I took just a 30mg codeine tablet for sore throat and that tiny taste was enough to realize the potential for so many levels of happiness that I've never unlocked. The weird part is that somehow my imagination was able to extrapolate and identify the good feels to human experiences I've been deprived of. I honestly believe got a taste of what experiencing true friendship would feel like, or being loved, and it was amazing. I got a little paranoid and flushed the pills away, or else I would have taken more. I know that if I took any serious amount of opiates I would be forever hooked.

These feelings of joy though are obviously worth going through a lot of shit for. They evolved to be nature's motivator to get people to run the race of making yourself more physically and socially fit to have as much sex as possible. But it's a sad fact that many people, due to genes or circumstances, will die without ever experiencing joy. Is the shit addiction puts you through really worse than that?",1458514378.0

Hey Crackhead

Yes, you. You sick fucker. On Wednesday morning I emerged from my girlfriend's building by U.N. Plaza to find that you had sawed the tops off both the sparkplugs on my motorcycle. At the time, I had no idea why anyone would do that. Other than the sparkplugs, the bike was untouched. Some kind of bizarre vandalism? A fraternity prank gone awry? I had no idea. All I knew is that I looked like a huge douchebag riding the Muni to work in a padded motorcycle jacket and helmet. 

Because the bike was immobilized I got a $35 street sweeping ticket that night. Thursday I had it towed to the shop ($45) where they replaced the sparkplugs and the boots ($50 including labor). They explained to me that ""people"" - I use the term loosely here - like you break off the tops of spark plugs and use the porcelain tubes to smoke crack. As an engineer and former MacGyver fan, in a way I think this is kind of cool. But then I remember that I just paid $100 for YOUR crackpipes, and I get angry again.

Crackhead, it was really good to have my bike back though. I rode home from the shop with a couple of spare sparkplugs and a smile on my face. I figured the next time I parked at my girlfriend's place overnight I would have to buy some crackpipes and tape them to my bike as a peace offering. Overall, I wasn't that upset. Despite having to ride the bus for three days and dropping a hundred bones at the shop, I had gained some fascinating knowledge, a new set of sparkplugs, and a pretty funny anecdote about how fucked up you are, and how our paths once crossed briefly in the night. 

But you couldn't just let sleeping dogs lie, could you Crackhead. You couldn't just stay in on Friday, watch Letterman through the window of a home electronics store and then call it a night. You couldn't rest on your laurels. Two porcelain sparkplug crackpipes just wasn't enough for you, was it Crackhead? You just had to come back for more. 

This morning, a scant fifteen hours after I rode it out of the shop, I found my motorcycle violated once again. This time you only took the right one - maybe you were having an off night. At least this time I had a spare sparkplug and the tools to fix it - or so I thought - having ordered a 73-piece toolset from SEARS.com last week. But no, the sparkplug socket in my new toolset was for American sparkplugs. So I had to go down to the neighborhood Ace hardware. They had an 18mm socket that would fit over my sparkplug, but it was for a 1/2"" drive ratchet. My toolkit only has 1/4"" and 3/8"" ratchets. So I had to buy a 1/2"" ratchet along with the socket. Even though the clerk took pity on me and gave me the senior citizen discount (I'm 25) it still cost me $22 all told. Now, you might say that I should have just gotten a 3/8""-to-1/2"" drive adaptor instead of springing for the whole ratchet. And to that I say ""Shut the hell up, Crackhead, I'm not finished. And besides, I was eventually going to buy a 1/2"" ratchet anyway so it's probably not worth it to take it back now.""

OK, now I'm rambling. But the point is, Crackhead, that you have done me wrong. Now, I get that you love crack. That is totally understandable. I've heard it is really fun, at first, and quite addictive. What I don't understand is, 

YOU ARE A CRACKHEAD. WHY DON'T YOU OWN A CRACKPIPE? 

I am an engineer. Do you ever see me shaking down bums in the Loin for a calculator and sliderule? No, you don't. Because engineering is the main thing I do, I went and bought myself a calculator. The main thing you do is crack. How do you get by without a crackpipe? The other crackheads must clown on you non-stop. I mean, the fucking saw you used to saw off my sparkplugs is probably worth five or ten bucks. Why not sell or trade it for a crackpipe? You really haven't put much thought into this, have you?

Please, Crackhead, please don't tell me you sold your crackpipe to buy crack. Even a stupid crackhead such as yourself couldn't possibly be that stupid. 

I've decided that taping crackpipes to my motorcycle would be tantamount to appeasement. You have crossed a line, Crackhead - specifically California Street. You have come onto my own street and you have desecrated that which I hold dear. You have stolen from me, and you have caused me to spend the last half hour writing this post instead of engineering shit, and it is concievable, if not likely, that my boss could find out about this and fire me. I am hella pissed at you dude. 

Here are my options as I see them:

1. Write a note saying that I have coated both of my sparkplugs in rat poison and tape it to my bike at night. You can thank Tim for that one, it was his idea. 

2. Don't write a note, but just coat both sparkplugs in rat poison. This is probably closer to a punishment that would fit your despicable crime. I'm sure this is super illegal and shit, but it's not like anyone is going to miss you, Crackhead. Don't fool yourself. 

3. Wait in an alley near my bike armed with my new stainless steel mirror-finish Ace Professional brand 1/2"" drive socket wrench, my 18mm sparkplug socket, and my searing rage. It's pretty heavy and well balanced. I am not a large man, but I am angry.

In conclusion, Crackhead, why don't you just do both of us a favor and buy yourself a crackpipe? It will both enhance your crack smoking experience and save me a lot of time and felony assault charges. Think about it.

Sincerely, 
Matt

They can be combinations you've already tried and enjoy, ones that you haven't yet had the opportunity to try but would like to, or hell even ones that you haven't had any experience with but are pretty sure would mesh well together. Obviously since this is /r/opiates I have a feeling many of these combos will in some way include an opiate (but that's not in any way a requirement). I'll start with a few of mine:

* Heroin+Methaqualone 
* Heroin+Secobarbital
* Heroin+Temazepam
* Heroin+Cocaine
* Heroin+Amphetamine
* Heroin+LSD
* Heroin+Mushrooms
* Heroin+Weed
* Cocaine+MDMA
* Cocaine+Alcohol
* Amphetamine+Alprazolam
* Amphetamine+Weed
* LSD+MDMA
* LSD+Mushrooms
* LSD+DXM
* LSD+2C-B/E/I/P
* LSD+Weed
* MDMA+Mushrooms
* MDMA+2C-B/E/I/P
* MDMA+Sildenafil
* Mushrooms+2C-B/E/I/P
* Basically Any Psychedelic+Alprazolam

Right now however, I'm in a position where I'm required to stay clean from heroin for a while. So the only combo I'll be doing for awhile is Buprenorphine/Methadone+Alprazolam+Cigarettes.

So what combos do you guys personally enjoy most?

**EDIT:** Bonus points if you can come up with a name for the combo! Such as how heroin+cocaine is known as a speedball, or how lsd+mdma is known a candyflip, etc.",1458491254.0
4b82vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4b82vv/i_got_soooo_lucky_and_wanted_to_share_with_my/,42,https://redd.it/4b82vv,gravityxkoala,I got soooo lucky... And wanted to share with my fellow opiate users :),"So yesterday I got arrested along with four other homeless people. We were violating a city ordinance, a petty offense. And I think we all definitely knew it, I certainly did, but normally the cops don't suck so bad. If you see them coming, you just start walking off down the road. Sometimes they'll honk their horn or beep their buzzer as a signal to clear out. More rarely, they'll stop, run your name for warrants, and tell you more harshly to clear out. However they can write you a ticket or arrest you and hold you for 24 hours while writing you a ticket. And of course address whatever warrants you have.

Well I saw the police coming down the road so I started to walk in the other direction. But they turned on their sirens and made me come back. I thought I'd be okay because I know I'm clear for warrantsa, but they immediately handcuffed me, told me I was under arrest, and sat me down. They round up the other four people also, who were in varying degrees down the street, and I realize we are surrounded by cops. And a paddy wagon shows up. And I start really panicking because one, I don't want to do 24 hours in jail; two, I have no way of contacting my boyfriend via phone to let him know what's up; and three and most imprtantly, I have dope hidden in my socks.

I start praying that they won't do more than possibly lightly pat me and the other two women down since all the cops were men. The cops are really rude of course, and the other people with me are varying degrees of upset. It was two couples. One was known to the police. The other had apparently never even been stopped hy the police before. And in fact I have no idea why the second pair were even there, but that's a whole other story. They load us all up and drive us miles south from where we started.

They let us in the police station and there are women police waiting for us. My anxiety escalates and I start cryiny (ugh) and shaking. Others probably thought I was upset about being arrested but I was just terrified I was going to go from petty offense to felony! She has me take off my coat and my hoodie and as I'm getting down to my t-shirt I mention I have an infection on my arm  (cellulitis, already did the antibiotics, but they don't ask me if I got treatment and I don't ever try to volunteer any info to the police...) and also that I'm positive for hep c. This stops the woman in her tracks, who clearly doesn't want to put her hands on me now, and the other police stop touching my belongings as well. They don't know what to do. They know they can't take me to the city jail with an infection unless it's had medical attention. They radio their LT to come look. He does and just says ok and walks off. I start suspecting they aren't going to want to deal with it and I go back to praying we are going to skip the search.

No luck. She has me take my hair down, looks in my mouth, and then wants me to kick my flip flops off and turn my socks inside out. (I know. So cool, flip flops and socks. All I can say for myself right now is that they are the only shoes I have right now.) So I crouch down and slowly peel my sock off and super clumsily transfer the plastic bag with my beans in it to my clenched fist. I mean... So clumsily. So not smooth. I am obviously screwing around with something. Until I can get the whole sandwich bag crammed in my clenched fist, there's plastic out. I have no idea how she didn't see it. She literally must not have even been looking. I yank my sock off so it's inside out. She says great put it back on. So I do and equally clumsily put my dope back in my sock. No word from her. Pull the other sock off only about a million times faster. Put it back on. Then she pats me down and runs her hands down my legs but not as low as the dope was. Pronounces me good and lets me put my hoodie and coat back on.

They lock the two men up in the cell right next to us and put the other two women down the hall in a cell. They leave me out and don't say anything to me for the longest time. I don't say anything either. I have crazy paranoid thoughts that she saw my shit and is waiting to ambush me (although of couse why would they bother). The police don't inventory my stuff or anything.

After twenty minutes of standing around, they get a summons sheet and start filling it out for me and I know I am being cut loose. I am super relieved. I feel terrible for the other four, who are going off to sit for at least 24 hours. At least one of the other women had a warrant, so she's obviously going to get passed around until all her legal is resolved. The cops discuss how they can slip me out without tipping off the women. Of couse they had this conversation in front of the men, so it was a total waste of breath since everyone else was a couple. They put me out the back door, returned my property and I got to leave with my dope and a summons to appear in court.

Tl;dr: got arrested, had dope in my sock, got searched, had a miracle and the police didn't find it. Didn't have to stay arrested because my arm had an infection and the police basically said fuck my medical problems.

Did I have a junkie jesus moment?? I can't keep track of what counts and what doesn't... But it sure felt like it to me yesterday.

Be safe out there guys, and I hope all of you are as lucky as I was yesterday.",1458489969.0

I thought I would share.. 

I first tried prescription drugs when I was 14 years old, with my then 17 year old girlfriend who was a senior in high school. It was a one time use and I really liked it but had no desire to continue using it at that point. She was a pill abuser and is largely the reason I got into drugs in the first place. She had a lot of problems and after things ended, she went with some older guy and got pregnant. As a 14 year old, it fucked me up pretty bad. I was almost certain she cheated on me too, and I went into a horrible depression. 

Fast forward to when I was about 16-17.. I drank with friends and smoked weed very occasionally but pills weren't in my life. Then I got a kidney stone. The pain was awful and they prescribed my hydrocodone and oxycodone multiple times. I remembered using when I was 14 and tried it recreationally again. 

I was in love.

I quickly went through the pills, being careful to space it out and not become physically dependent.. but I became very dependent psychologically. I was using them at school and it was so fun. I felt like I came out of my shell and my social anxiety just melted away. It felt amazing. I started taking old meds from my cabinet and  trying to find them anywhere. I even contacted the girl who I dated freshman year looking for them and she hooked me up lol. It was getting bad. Then I met a girl.

She got me to stop using and I did for her. I loved her so much and I knew it was the right thing to do. Fast forward 6 months through that relationship to now and I haven't used for a little over that time. But we fell out.. largely due to her wanting to control my life so much. I felt trapped and like I wasn't myself. I should have known when she wanted me to change the drug/drinking part of me but I thought she was just looking out. I know she was but the control stemmed into my own life and I had to end things. 

So now here I am. I have no pills or connections but I want to use again so so so bad. I'm on here reading every day and I just miss it.. so yeah lol just a shitpost that I wanted to write down. I think I just feel like a bird thats been in a cage so long and I want to go back to how I felt. ",1458655040.0

4bgbpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4bgbpq/birthday_rollercoaster/,5,https://redd.it/4bgbpq,207JunctioningFunky,Birthday Rollercoaster,"Well, today (Monday) was certainly a bit of a rollercoaster. It was my 22nd birthday, and I woke up broke with a shot just barely big enough to keep me well for a couple hours. 


I called dboy and he told me to come thru, so I stopped in there on the way to work. He said he had a surprise for me, I was hoping for a new batch or something, but instead he had a line of coke laid out for me. Now I'm obviously more of a downer guy, but this was some of the best coke I have ever done.



 The other surprise was that he wasn't going to have any down until late tonight or possibly tomorrow morning. Needless to say, I was a little upset since that meant a sober day at work, which is like saying a  comfortable day in Hell. This dboy is actually a really good guy and friend, he'll almost always spot me something as long as he has it to at least keep me well for the day. 



The bright side was some fuego coco and he told me as soon as his down got there he was gonna break me off something for my birthday. So I went to work high as a kite off a single line and took a handful of gaba just in case I started to feel the WDs from the dope. 8 very long anxious hours later spent worrying and trying to figure out how I was gonna get right before dinner with my family and girlfriend, I got a phone call.



It was from another dboy that owed me a half g from my last pickup from him a couple weeks ago. He was calling to say happy birthday and he was back in town and to come thru when I got out of work. I went over there as soon as I got out and he had a quarter gram for me. Whenever he owes me anything I have him pay me back in dope in multiple small payments since my self control is almost as shitty as my attitude.


 The thing is tho, a quarter of his shit lasts me three times as long as a quarter from the first dboy from this rambling story. As soon as I picked that shit up I went straight to my favorite place to park and shoot and did a solid shot that got me nice and functionally high for dinner. Then I went and picked up my girl, roasted a blunt on the way over to my parents for dinner. 


Had some dank salmon, homemade scalloped potatoes, butternut squash with a fuckton of brown sugar and butter, and some salad. German chocolate cake for dessert. After dinner with the fam I dropped my girl off and went to another friends to burn another blunt. Then dboy 1 called me and offered me a quarter gram of the fuego coco to pick up some food that he ordered and deliver it to him, along with some cigarettes, wraps, and soda. 


I of course jumped at the opportunity as the restaurant and store were literally directly across from each other and less than two miles from his place. He gave me the coco when I stopped in to snag the cash for the food and other stuff, so naturally I found a nice spot to stop and try some of that coke the right way.



 HOLY FUCK. I knew it was really fucking good from that line this morning, but a shot the same size had me fucking geeked. It is by far the best coke I've ever shot, and it is more than likely the best in the state of Maine at this point in time. (Hence this long, rambling, mostly coherent story). When I got back to their crib (it's around 11 or so at this point, I had given up on them getting anything until the morning) I saw their cousins car in the driveway, which meant that they had that sweet, sweet medicine.



 When I got back inside with all the food and stuff, they rolled me a fat birthday blunt, dboy broke me off a .4 of the down for my birthday, and his cousin gave  me almost a gram of that same coke(which I didn't expect at all, since I only do business with dboy 1 aka his cousin). As soon as I got home I prepped a nice fat speedball with a .15 of coke and a .07 of the dope. I'm so glad that I've brought my use down a bit these past couple weeks, between that and the higher quality product, that speedball has me the highest that I've been in at least a year, if not two. So I started my day broke and hoping something would come together at some point, and by some minor miracle things fell into place. I needed today to go well since I haven't been in a very good place lately, it's been a rough 2016 so far. But today gave me a feeling that maybe, just maybe, things might actually be looking up. But maybe it's just the drugs talking.

In short, two weeks ago, I went to an ER, as it was hard to breathe, and breathing was painful / stabby, compounded by a tight feeling in my chest / upper back. The docs weren't able to give me any real diagnosis. Chest film and CT showed nothing wrong, other than some scar tissue in my lower lungs, most likely indicating a previous bout with bronchitis.

Fast forward to today. I woke up, and my lungs have a tickle deep down. Said tickle is causing me to (infrequently, but frequently enough) cough, very hard, for a few seconds at a time. It's not hard to breathe, per se, but but the tickle is making it difficult to take deeper breaths. Some sputum (yellowy-green) is coming up, but not very much. Taking an occasional puff of albuterol helps a little.

Of course, with my recent ER visit, and today's cough, I've decided to diagnose myself with CHF. I'm sure it's not, heh, but my mind still isn't at ease. This past weekend, I exposed myself to two different Walmarts; it's more than likely that I just picked up something from someone who was generous enough to share their grodiness. If things worsen, over night, I'll get myself in to see a doc, pronto.

Growing up, I don't recall ever being diagnosed with bronchitis or the like. I haven't had any recent colds. Does bronchitis have a quick onset? You guys are terribly resourceful, and there are many of you whose opinions I highly value. What are your thoughts?

p.s.- Since my initial ER visit, and the nurses' myriad attempts at drawing blood, my right forearm (very close to a spot where an attempt was made) has been in a nearly-constant spasm. All day long, the top of my arm quivers / moves on its own. Thinking about it gives me anxiety, so I try to ignore it .. but of course, it's not that easy. Should this also be checked out?

p.p.s.- Apparently, I lied: this post is a little longer, and I apologize. Please, don't hate on me for it. ;) I'd just like some ideas, please. Hearts to youz guyz. Thanks.",1458616545.0

I’m clearheaded enough to see myself for what I am, afraid but accepting. I hate what I’ve done, to my friends and family and loved ones. I had to drop out of school because I was underperforming; drugs and depression go hand in hand straight to the cliff. I’ve had a near overdose that landed me in the hospital and I’ve made choices that stuck me scared and alone in a cold, uncaring world.

But for the first time in years, I’m able to stare it down. I can sit by the fireside with two great friends and watch the night sky turn pale approaching dawn. I can turn online and see the love of users, both active and recovering, pouring out to find a missing member of the using family. Heroin isolated me from the people around me, and kept me from myself. I wouldn’t lie and say that wasn’t partially the goal. I never wanted to be near myself. I wanted to get the fuck away, stay somewhere else for a while, forget whatever pain was coursing through my body so I could just breathe.

My breaths were laced with the ashes of a thousand cigarettes.

My blood was dripping languid, dreamy heroin.

My sight was clouded and black at the edges, nodding off to oblivion.

That’s not what I want any more.

A user posted here a little while back, talking about how she found her humanity again after she kicked. Her mother’d told her she always felt too much, too strongly. When she got clean, it all came back. Pain first, as is the custom. Getting clean is like waking up from a nightmare only to realize you’re hanging from a cliff. We all live close to death, either by heart or heroin.

Then, all at once, the rest of her emotion crashed over her like a wave. Everything together, almost too deeply to manage. We lose ourselves in the things we most want, and become addicted to everything. My general social vice is to become a sponge for the pain of those around me. I want to take it all and hold on, just for a minute or an hour or more, so the lives of those around me are, for those moments, manageable.

I love this about myself.

And if I can feel so strongly, I’m not the only one. I’m not scared and alone in a cold, uncaring world. For every second I hurt, I love an hour.

I am very proud of my sadness, because it means that I am more alive.

My friend is semi-homeless, jobless, with no kids. She has back problems from falling off a horse when she was a teenager, which didn't hurt then, but has hurt the last couple of years, and because of it, she can't work and she has gained weight as it hurts to stand for more than 10-15 minutes and walking really hurts it.

She doesn't have insurance, and she has tried to get on Medicare, but the doctor took one look at her and saw that she was overweight, and assumed that that was the issue and told her to lose weight. So she was denied Medicare.

That is the first issue - should she re-apply and ask for another doctor? I was there when they did the ""test"", and the doctor told her to touch her toes, and when she couldn't the doctor said the excess weight was the cause of her problems. The doctor was a massive cunt.

Secondly, her food stamps are going to be cut-off because now in Florida, anybody that is able-bodied and between 18-?49? has to go to job centers for 80 hours a month, which is really difficult because she has no car, and would have to ride the bus and walk around more than is probably good for her because of her back - does anyone have any suggestions on what she should do? If she loses her food stamps, she will probably lose a bunch of weight because she will have no food, but i don't that is the proper way to lose weight.

Edit: Fixed some things.

Edit to clarify:

This is her options when signing up for Medicaid:

*Medical Assistance for Children, their Parents or Caretakers, Pregnant Women and individuals who aged out of Florida Foster Care who are under age 26.* 

Which she is none of these.

*Medical Assistance for Individuals in Nursing Home* 

Which she is not.

*Medical Assistance for Individuals in HCBS/Waivers* 

Which she is not.

*Medical Assistance for Individuals in Hospice* 

Which she is not.

*Medical Assistance For the Aged, Blind or Disabled* 

This is the one she applied for, under disabled, and this is the reason she was denied, because the doctor said she wasn't disabled, just overweight. But when she fell off of her horse, it stunted the growth of one leg, and know she has a leg length discrepancy, which causes back pain.",1458608329.0

I took my script straight to wallgreens and handed the pharmacy tech the paper, went and sat down. Sat there for 30 minutes and went to go check on the progress. The lady tells me they are waiting for my doctor to fax back a prior authorization form and I will have to come back on Saturday. Damn, this sucks.... I have to pick up my kid in 2 hours and I'm hurting. 

I decide ""Fuck It"", I'm not going to let this shit ruin my time with my son. I call up my other guy and explained the situation and got fronted 10 percs to hold me over. I'm down to my last 40 bucks and half is buying us food and the other is paying my copay. 

Saturday morning comes around and nothing new. The doctor is closed and I would have to wait until Monday. God damn, this shit sucks. 

I go to Wallgreens bright and early at 9am, right when they open. Okay, i'm in dire pain, get my shit filled. Still waiting, sir!! I call my doctor to find out whats going on and they explain Blue Cross faxed them a god damn novel to fill out and they just didn't have the time to do it. This doc was lazy as fuck, but the only one to take my insurance. So how much does it cost without insurance? $290. I can't afford that shit. I have $20 dollars on me. I can only buy 1. Gotta figure somthing out. 

So I ended up calling my friend and making a business deal to buy them all, while I only get 10 and he gets 20 to sell, eat, stick up his butt for all I care. I at least have something for the next two weeks. 

However, Fuck you Blue cross. I finally take the leap to get my life straight, and you have to go fuck it all up. You ruined my weekend with my son. You wont cover the medicine I need (and I never go to the doc, I dont ever use my insurance) and the only time i use it you wont fucking cover it. Oh wait, yeah you do, but you make it impossible to obtain. I hate you. Rant over.",1458600796.0

I went to my pain management doctor today and at the end of the appointment she asked me to submit to a drug test.  She said it had something to do with my insurance (which is new as of this year) and they wanted to make sure I was taking my medication and not selling it (I'm not selling it).  As background, I've been going to her for years after re-herniating a disc in my back that was already surgically repaired.  I've gone from a pretty high dose of Percocet down to what I'm now on (at my request) which is the hydrocodone 5's.  


About four weeks ago I had an rx for 120 and I went through those due to high pain in about two weeks.  I then had none for a weekend and they refilled an rx for me last Monday for 60 more.  I finished those on late Friday night / earlier AM Saturday.  I haven't taken any in about 60 hours prior to peeing in the cup.  I'm wondering if I still test positive for my medication when they screen my urine?  I've pretty much been prescribed opiates for the last 8 months with intermittent breaks in use of about 48 when I run out on weekends so I'm definitely a frequent, daily user so I'm not sure if like other drugs that will keep it in my system longer.


I've always been honest with her in the past about how I take more that prescribed and she knows on many occasions they've refilled my rx early because of that. I told her I was taking more than prescribed in a given day these last two refills but I didn't tell her I hadn't taken them in two days because I ran out due to embarrassment.  She thinks I have a few days left and hadn't stopped taking them because I ran out.  I was also honest with her that I occasionally use edible marijuana for the pain and she thanked me for my honesty and said she was totally fine with that.


I'm wondering if I'll still piss hot for my medication?  Looking online says they only stay in the system 1-2 days but I don't know what kind of use that's based off of.  I don't want it to come back clean and have her think I'm selling it and get rid of me as a patient.  What would happen if it did come back negative and how long do those tests typically take?


She also gave me another rx for 120 before I left and my next appointment isn't for another month.",1458599166.0

What are some things you would like to see or feel they should know. This thread is going to be shared directly with NIDA so fire away. These are topics that were discussed this morning.
Topics included:
- more research on cannabis as an alternative to opioids. They say they have money available currently for structured trials
- research on cannabis for withdrawal
- expansion of naloxone
- engaging current users in conversation (reddit Q& A coming soon)
- research on the efficacy of loperamide for withdrawal. 
- patient education on opioids 
- efforts to make naloxone over the counter
- strategic placement of naloxone (similar to AEDs) in public places
- what research is being done on pain and when opioids are necessary. 
- opportunities for former users to speak directly to doctors.

So today I was watching my niece for my sister while my sister was out at work (local grocery store). My sister is an addict also but only to hydroconde also her tolerance is so low any of us in this sub would be jealous.She has been on hydrocodone everyday pretty much for 4 years+ and still only has to take two hydro 10s to get faded and 4 makes her puke.

So today while watching the kid I decided to do a shot in the living room since I out my niece down for a nap and I knew she was sleeping (or so I thought). Also I knew my sister or her boyfriend would not be home for another two hours. I did not think anything bad would happen since I thought I made 110% certain I would be ok to shoot in peace.

I get my rig ready and tie off... I get blood in my rig so I knew i registered (semi proud I did first try). Anyways as soon as I untie while plunging down my niece comes in the living room and sees me finish shooting up. Now I know she has no idea what is up because she is only four but the look in her eye of what the fuck am in doing made my stomach dropped.

My rule when I pick up for myself or helping out friends is never to involved children or any one under the age of 18 so I don't feel like a scumbag. Well today my fear came true.

She won't tell her mom so my cover won't be blown but it still sucks knowing she saw me shoot up. I think this was a good wake up call to see how shitty I have been living my life. I am going to talk it over with my girlfriend (whose addicted to coke) about signing up for a maintainence program.

Is it simply that obtaining Oxy is so difficult that the price is inflated due to huge demand and lack of supply or is there something special about the black market pills that make them especially good to abuse, such as they don't gel up or something similar to that? I would also be interested to know about the different methods of anti-abuse used in pills and how to know whether they're present.

I find it all quite interesting, I would appreciate any other interesting suggestions on this topic (Oxycodone and the like) like documentaries to watch if anybody has any. The more research into this world I can do the better.

So much so that I feel like I have to plan my dosing around my interactions with people.

Does anyone else experience this in an intense way? And more importantly, have any of you figured out how to get over this and be able to be that same person when you aren't high?

And of course he assures me that everything would be copacetic and not to worry as, ""I gots you mane.""

So I let this dboy know that I'll meet up with him around noon and pick up a gram for $100, just to see if this batch lives up to his hype. Once I get in the area, he first has me pick him up a pack of Newports and a 3-pack of vanilla White Owls because like so many other dboys, he doesn't have a damn car. No problem though. Pick up his shit and take it out of the hundo I'm paying him. Get into his neighborhood 5 min later and give him his cigs, cigars, and the remaining money; and he gives me my bag. Of course I looked the bag over before handing him all his shit, but the it looked and felt legit, or at least close to what it should weigh. He then asks if I could buy him a pre-paid Visa/MC gift card and he'd hook me up with another gram for $90. I said I didn't have the time but if this bag was decent, I'd come back later and do that deal.

I get home and through the bag on my bench and it weighs out to 0.85g, so not even a full g. Not a huge issue as long as the product really was flame. Proceed to do a test shot... And nothing. I literally didn't feel a damn thing. Draw up another shot (a size I normally take) and once again nothing. So I then proceed to do the whole fucking ""gram"" within an hour or so, and I literally didn't feel anything let alone get high. So this fucker sold me a gram of straight cut for $100. It actually kind of humored me because I haven't gotten ripped-off this badly in a while. I decided to chalk it up as a loss to the game and didn't even call up this douchebag to bitch.

I know this guy will wind-up calling me within a day or two to try to sell me more, because anytime I've picked something up from him in the past, he'd call every damn day for a week or two trying to sell me more. After about two weeks he'd usually take the hint and realize I'll call him if I want something. I can't wait for the call or text that's inevitably coming tomorrow or the next day just so I can tell him to lose my fucking number and he'll never get a damn dollar from me again, unless he makes this right. And I'm positive this dumb fuck will try to work some kind of deal like he'll give me a gram to make that right, but only if I buy another one from him. And I'll reiterate to this scumbucket that he's not getting any money whatsoever from me until he gives me a legit gram with no strings attached or he can lose my number.

Some dboys are so fucking retarded ripping off potential repeat customers for a relatively small amount of money, when in the long run, they could make much, much more by actually serving legit bags. I really don't understand their line of ""thinking"" especially with dboys like this guy who obviously doesn't have very many customers. It's damn easy to see why he doesn't. Maybe one day he'll learn but I'm not gonna hold my breath (or give him any more of my hard earned money). Sadly, the only ""good"" thing is that I didn't take him up on buying him that gift card and getting ripped-off by another $90. Also, I wound up hitting up my main connect right after and picked up a g of some legit dope that wound up being even better than his normal product. Too bad I didn't just buy 2g's off of him from the giddy-up. If you managed to get through this novel-length shitpost, thanks for reading!

**TLDR; Why do some dboys be so retarded making a small amount of money in the short run by ripping potential repeat customers off, when they could make much, much more cheddar in the long run by just being legit? The world may never know...**",1458713952.0

I have had some experiences with trying to make a nice putty I can just tear a piece off if I need to get a buzz on, without having to gag on the nasty tea. Here is what I plan to do...

Will be using 5lbs of good, unwashed seeds. I have used this source before. Pouring approx. 1lb of the seeds into my 2 liter bottle, I will fill with water until about 1cm above the seeds, or until they start to float. I will shake for 30sec then pour into a measuring cup, then perform a 2nd and 3rd wash using the same water. Once done, I will start filtering the tea using 2 coffee filters together, dampened with water. I will then pour the tea into a casserole dish and do the exact same thing with all my seeds. I like to use a hair dryer to evaporate my tea, as my over only goes down to 170, and it has always worked well, just use heat not cool and on the highest setting. After the water is nearly all gone, ill place under a box fan on high for 12 to 24hrs, then I hope to have a very pure putty, which can hopefully be smoked with little fuss.

Any thoughts, suggestions? And do you think it will be pure enough to smoke/vaporize?",1458696083.0

His first urine test came back very low for marijuana ( he stopped smoking weed also 3 to 4 weeks ago)  and a moderate amount of morphine.

Okay, so at the time my ex and I were living in a hotel, and I was working at the local mall, him at the Lowe's. New Years Eve rolls around, we spend our Time watching street performers, like a crazy dude in a full checkered spandex body suit playing with light up hula hoops and dancing to techno, going inside to watch the countdown with an older couple we'd just met. Life was good.


I was sooo hungover the next morning, but I had work and did not wanna miss it. Well, my ex. Call him K, decided that new year's day was to be the day he got me higher than giraffe snatch on these damn ""Bath Salts"", and mind you this was right after the Zombie Face Munchers from Florida incident, so I was a little wary to try them, to say the least. We amble around town, still half drunk at ten AM, finally finding a head shop that sells em. We buy a couple bags, and my ever charismatic ex somehow breaks the language barrier and gets the shop keeper to let us use his private bathroom together after just purchasing these Bath Salts. We go in, he racks us a line on the back of the toilet, and we pass the straw back and forth, taking it in halves.
I made it out the front door til I projectile vomit all remaining liquid from my body, and next thing I know, I'm fucked UP. tweaking good. My boy had work too, but early, so we parted ways for the day and he left me with the rest of the drugs.


I somehow find some ancient homeless dude with rigs on my way back to get ready for work . this is a couple months after the belt incident and by now I could pretty much shoot myself up without problems, and of course the needle freak in me is champing at the bit to try a new drug IV.

I got back to the hotel, showered. Then fixed the bath salts.... And Holy. shit. It's like peaking on ecstasy and then blowing a line of coke. I do a couple more for good measure then head out to work,. I got there an hour late after I forget about traffic. I'm sure I was a sight, hungover, tired, tweaking balls... Well the manager comes upstairs and I see him watching me.
 I try to look busy and not so spun but he comes up and asks me why I'm so jittery, what's wrong? Fuck, I didn't know I was so shaky. Off the top of my head, I lied that I had low blood sugar and had not eaten that day. His face brightened as he goes. Oh hold on, I'll get you something to eat. While I wait for the manager, I'm noticing, fuck man, my mouth is so dry. Like desert dry. The level of cotton mouth only tweaking can bring. My throat rattled and the walls of my throat stuck together, my tongue was glued to the roof of my mouth. 


Then the manager returns... *ominous music* and walks up to me as I fight to remain calm as I suffocate. He then says sweetly... Here you go. Stretched his hand out...


Oh fuck no. This nigga gave me a nature valley granola bar dude. The driest food known to man. He then sits there smugly watching with what looks like victory on his dumb neck beard face as for ten grueling minutes I choke down this dry, dusty ass granola bar, at moments coughing and tearing up.

I tried to make myself throw up as soon as I got home and I puked a tiny bit, but it's just too gross to continue. I had a large meal around 10-11 and it looked like my brunch more than actual methadone (the methadone I take is pink/red). What the fuck do I do now

I set out to see, using internet references, if I could find a definitive answer for how long the window of detection is for opiates. I couldn't find one. Results for opiates specifically varied from 7-72 hours.

LabCorp, an oral fluid testing company, claims the detection window is from 5-48 hours.

Cliawaived, another drug testing services, claims the window of detection is shorter, from 7-21 hours. (http://www.cliawaived.com/web/items/pdf/I-DOA-76%20iScreen_6_Panel_Drug_Testing~1683file1.pdf)

An NIH study from 2004, provides the same window of detection as LabCorp, 5-48 hours. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15228165)

An additional NIH study on the window of detection specifically for codeine provides a window of 7-21 hours.

A variety of other drug testing companies provided either identical windows as the to NIH studies or windows of 24-48 hours. (https://www.omegalabs.net/oral-fluid-testing/oral-fluid-testing-faqs/hair-testing-faq.cmsx)

I also found less reliable sources providing windows up to 3 days or 72 hours for opiates.

An additional NIH study provided a window of detection of 5-48 hours. Here is an excerpt:

""In general, Verstraete reported that drugs of abuse could be detected in oral fluid for 5 to 48 hours (Verstraete, 2004). Of course, as previously described, cutoff concentrations, collection device specifications, analytes tested and detection methodology will influence detection rates. Furthermore, the dose administered also may influence detection windows""

This story is 100% true and 100% hilarious. 



So I was at the mall, where I was working at the time and I had a using buddy that I had met on the bus. He was around my age, and when I first met him, he said if i trusted him (lol. I didn't I was just desperate) he would bring me back a $5 piece because that's all I had on me at the time and he would bring me a clean. He then gave me his wallet with his ID to hold onto till he got back. Well I never expected them to really come back, But he did! This was thestart of a beautiful friendship. One day he brings me in my stuff to work and as per usual I asked about going for a bathroom break. I met up with him in the food court and then we headed over to the bathrooms - the family ones with the breastfeeding stations in them.


 So my buddy, who we will call Jake , and I go into one of the little stations, close the curtain and got nice and comfy and began preparing my shot. Now at this time I had barely started shooting, and was still mostly having other people do it for me . so Jake was going to do my shot when I noticed the time. I was in a real Crunch and had to get back to work ASAP. We were looking all over but could not find a vein anywhere, so I asked him""Do you know how to hit people in the neck?"", He said 'ive never done it before but I probably could if you let me try.' 


Being a newbie, I asked the completely innocent question ""Do you have to tie off?"" He says "" I don't know but I can't see your vein there. So yeah, why don't we try it? Here use my belt"" haha so ive got this kid sitting between my legs while I sit in this big lazy boy type chair. and he's sitting there holding my shot while I take his belt and loop it around my neck. I pull the belt taut, and pulling it back and up as far as I can, almost choking myself out. All of a sudden some guy blasts through the curtain and Witnesses what probably looks like some kind of kinky sex moves. He is obviously very bugged out and kind of just fumbled with the curtain for a second there goes , oh... oh my God ! Im so sorry"" and smashes the curtains closed. Now I'm like oh shit man I need to get out of here. So I scrambled back to work, put on my ID badge and spend the rest of the day praying that no one comes in and recognizes me . lol!

4bril9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4bril9/450_of_codeine_no_euphoria_and_boring_notes_about/,4,https://redd.it/4bril9,meyoubefriends,"450 of codeine, no euphoria? And boring notes about my CWE.","Hello, I took 450 mg of codeine 2 hours ago, and I'm not feeling any good effects. Only a bit drunk, dizzy, nauseous, sedated. Face and palms feel a bit numb. Feeling some effects of caffeine, also, which is to be expected, since there was ~1700 mg of it in the solution. Why am I not feeling euphoria, or any other good effects? Does this lack of positive response to codeine mean I'm not going to get high from heroin also? It's bit weird, too, that 1.7 g of caffeine is having such a small effect on me. Maybe the manufacturer put less in the pills.

I'll write a bit about my CWE tek. I did a cold water extraction of around 56 pills consisting of paracetamol (500 mg)/codeine (8 mg)/caffeine (30 mg). Beforehand, I had tried 50 mg, then, 200 mg of codeine. After filtering out the paracetamol, I followed [Chromic's](https://www.erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/codeine.chromic.html) caffeine removal guide - added some 500 ml of water to the codeine/caffeine solution, put it on a very very light boil, till the water evaporated to 50 ml, then put in fridge overnight, in the morning I put the solution through a coffee filter. I don't think the Chromic's tek worked, because there was no cotton candy like caffeine stuff in the water, there was barely anything in the filter, in fact. Anyways, I then drank the resulting intensely bitter solution.

Important notes about cold water extraction that I learned. Read if you want to do a CWE:

'1. Doing my second extraction, I made a dangerous mistake. I noticed that after dissolving the crushed pills in water there were a lot of these micro particles, ""rocks"" that did not fully dissolve. So I heated the solution on a stove for a few mins, thinking it would break up these particles and release the codeine inside. That did break up the particles, but when it was time for filtering (after cooling in a freezer), there was almost no paracetamol in the coffee filter! Foolishly, I still drank the solution, and in doing so ingested up to 13 grams of paracetamol (since I used 25 pills). Thank goodness this only resulted in liver pains for the rest of the day and nothing worse.

**Always use cold water** (I use around 10 °C), never hot, to dissolve the crushed pills. If there is nothing in the filter, never drink the water, it can cost you your life! Next time, when I used cold water for dissolving, there was a lump of paracetamol the size of a small plum in the filter and no liver pains at all.

'2. Most people doing a CWE, after they cool the solution, they take it out of the freezer and then filter it. The problem with this is, while the water is filtering in room temp, it can become warm again and allow more paracetamol to dissolve, defeating the whole purpose of a *cold water* extraction. Instead, put it in the fridge while it's filtering. That way even less paracetamol will make it through.

'3. The less water you use to dissolve the pills, the less paracetamol you will ingest. The solubility of paracetamol in 20 °C water is 12.78 mg/ml, and even less in near 0 °C water. If you use 100 ml of water (I recommend 70 ml), you will certainly not ingest more than 1278 mg of paracetamol (which is a small amount), and, in reality, less than that, since you'll use very cold water. The solubility of codeine phosphate (which was in my pills), according to [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20061016033007/http://www.janssen-ortho.com/JOI/pdf_files/tylenol_E.pdf), is 4 g/ml, so, a negligible amount of water can be used.

'4. Always use a good filter, like a coffee filter. I would not risk using a piece of cloth, toilet paper or tissue towels. Wet the filter first to not lose any codeine.

Edit: Forgot to add, I have no tolerance to opiate, only experimented with codeine (200 mg) last week.",1458825758.0

* Are there rooms where you can go and shoot up or smoke your drugs? 

* Has every state an needle exchange? Do your pharmacies sell needles? 

* What kind of needles are you using - are diabetes syringes normal for you guys?

* Do you have vending machines for drug supply, too?

* Is it common to jam your blood before shooting, too? (with a band like this http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51mFWzT456L._SX466_.jpg )

* How do you filter your dope? With cigarette filters or are you using these little things you put on the syringes which are extra made for using? If yes, where do you get them? 

* Are dealers generally working in gangs/groups or on their own? 
* Are some hanging out on a special spot and are kind of obvious or aren't their places with obvious drug dealing going on? 
* What options do you have at an substitution program? Just Methadone and Buprenorphin or also another substance like Morphin?

* Where do you have to go to get substituted and how does it work daily? Can you just go to a doctor? 
* Is there an option of getting your daily dose for at home after proving you'Re not using any other substances anymore? 
* and also a very personal question; Why are you using?

I watched you grow up
 from just a normal kid to a fuck up
I watched you sink deeper in this hole
I watched what your cousin did to you when you were a kid take its toll
I never blamed you
I never wanted to shame you
I only ever cared for you
It was always just me you and the crew
Till substances came along 
Then life went by in a blink of an eye
From the days of getting drunk at the park singing along to the that song the other side
But its not a song anymore
You aren't who you were anymore 
and neither am I 
Thats why no one bates an eye when your on it
And yeah we get it life sucks so you flaunt it
We get it, Nothing is the same without it
that little pill makes the sun come out when its clouded
Them op’s made you not know me
That girl roxy really stole ya
Them poppy really learned how to hold ya
Them oxys really learned how to get to know ya
Drugs were your life, as it was mine
And yes I get it trust me I get it. 
It is so divine when your sadness goes away and the pain stops
But what happens when your heart stops like sadie
and when you turn to needles to get a buzz
and dope to keep you up
and yeah we all get it that aint water in your cup
And yeah we all get it your sad and depressed
The worlds been unkind to you and your under a lot of stress
From your mom leaving you to your dad not caring
To the house foreclosing 
and yeah we get the whole worlds told you your a fuck up
And you are starting to believe
Yeah we all see it you gave up a bit ago
You lost your mind when it came to that sophomore hoe.
And yeah we get it she really fucking hurt you
more than I can even grasp
but was it all really worth it to statutorily rape that ass. 
And yeah i guess I dont get it when it comes to your addiction
I understand the gas but that dopes fucking with your life's ignition
But yeah how'd you not get it
When the heart monitor was on
When the doc said you aint got much time left if you keep it up
You gotta slow down son 
Why you always on the run
Whats chasing you, your demons or your dreams.
You was always about the scheme. money was the motive but now oxy is your dream.
And yeah we get it you dont love yourself
But neither do I
 do we really need help?
What was the problem with your life, I get the odds weren't in your favor
But then again neither were they in mine
You use to clown on me for that twitch I had in grade school
or that stutter when I was growing up
Ive known you for 15 years and thats the saddest part about it
We grew up together
raised each other
Bitch your my fucking brother
I get you wanna die
I get no ones there when you cry
I get when the news comes barely anyone will bat an eye
but I will 
Chuck will, stevie will, nikki will, 
You are more important than you think
Stop belittling yourself 
Stop hating yourself, because I have gone down that path and its a dead end. 
this self pity shit is destructive my friend. 
This addiction shit is hard, I get you withdrawal. 
I know you get sick when you wake up
and it doesn't go away till your putting lines up your nose like a holly wood hoe
but it aint coke your on
just stay strong
cuz if theres a will theres a way
The storm will pass one day
The sun will shine without the find of a couple of little pills
This shit your on wont make you stronger
Heroin wont make your life longer
Oxy wont make you happy
Poppys wont take the pain away
 or the memories
or bring your mom back to your house 
or bring your family back together
All the drugs i did never saved mine
And yeah this is the life that we chose
highland park trash 
living life to fast since you were 13 
I was 14
I guess that made the difference
You did coke when I thought that shit wasn't real
First time I ever met a meth head was with you
first time I ever was introduced to drugs was with you
First time I watched a kid get jumped was with you
First time I stole something was with you
WE WERE BAD
and thats why i am so mad 
GROW THE FUCK UP
I get you think that we will never grow up
we will never get old
live fast die faster is the moto
You get your fucking around with the grime reapers lotto
With each time you do this
I get more distant
With each time you dose yourself
I grow further away
You have been as good as dead to me the day you told me you would quit liquor for downers
You have been dead to me the day you told me you thought you were going crazy and always tweeted about suicide.
And nothing has ever rang so clearly to me than the day you said you always have that feeling you get
when you are going down a rollercoaster. 
That on edge feeling where you can explode on anyone
But you want to know something 
We all feel like that
We all get angry everyday
We all have that chip on our shoulder
you aren't the only one depressed
you aren't the only one addicted
you aren't the only one who needs saving
So please see what I see
do as I do
And please for the love of god get off Heroin 
Cuz I will never give up on you.

I bought a few and tried them out, and they seem to do a good job at filtering out all the unwanted ingredients, but do we have much information on the safety of this chemical for medical use? 

The use of micron wheel filters has become a huge component of harm reduction, but should we really be advocating the use of a chemical not yet deemed safe for injection? In this [safety sheet](http://wcam.engr.wisc.edu/Public/Safety/MSDS/PVDF%20PolyVinylidene%20Fluoride.pdf) for the plastics manufacturer ""Quadrant,"" they state with respect to PVDF:

>IF SWALLOWED: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. GIGE WATER TO DRINK. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY. NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY MOUTH TO AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON. 

>IF INHALED: IF DUST OR VAPORS ARE INHALED, REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT, GIVE OXYGEN AND GET MEDICAL ATTENTION.

This is a bit alarming. They don't mention anything about ""in case of injection,"" as they clearly don't expect that to be a problem in their applications, but should we? I'm quite the lay person, so perhaps I'm misinterpreting this, but it's got me a bit concerned. Maybe the PVDF used at ""Engineering Plastic Products"" (where the above info is from) is different than the PVDF used in the micron filters? I don't know, but I can't seem to find any data on its use in preparing IV solutions. 

Thoughts? If someone out there is more knowledgable about this subject, or PVDF in general, I'd love to hear what you think. Should we reevaluate the use of these PVDF filters with respect to harm reduction? I'd hate to think what this substance could possibly be doing to myself and other users who are trying to *reduce* the harm done to their bodies.

I come to you today for three reasons.

1) Could someone help me by pointing me towards a decent list of different opiates that are in rotation now, and if they have any special effects? I am trying to further educate myself on the subject on opiates and it's different forms, and whatever intel I find ""officially"" feels really speculative and not fully fact checked.

2) Because of your help and kind words, I have helped improve the situation for our users, and will now be instructing a smaller group of guards every 3 months in how to meet and handle users of opiates. Everything from helping with withdrawals to when medical attention is needed.

3) And I want to check in on you all. How are you guys doing? Any new happenings in your life?

I am so grateful for everything you guys have done to help me help others, and I want to pay you guys back somehow but don't know how.

Quick background: I've been on subs since April 2015, with 2 major relapses in between. My current doctor has me on 3mg of subutex a day. He recently pulled some greedy bullshit and wants me to now see him TWICE a month, doubling my already high $160 appt fee + $20 script fee (only thing covered by my insurance, sucks).

His program was an ""extended taper program"", where basically I started at 8mg, and he lowered me down every other month of so.

I just made an appointment with a new doctor for next Thursday (same day as my ""follow up"" with my current doctor would be). This place, its 300$ first appointment, and $100 a month after that (substantially cheaper). My friend saw the doctor here, and I think he was prescribed 16mg from the jump.

I told them I am currently on 3mg, but I felt a lot more comfortable at 8mg. I would REALLY like to get 16mg, so it would cover both me and my girl for the month (she KILLS my fucking stash with 3mg a day, its brutal right now...).

I know that I want to switch from an extended taper to a maintenance (I'm not ready to detox right now in life),

Is there anything I can tell this doctor that will increase my chances of getting prescribed 8mg-16mg/day, even though I'm at 3mg of subutex right now?

Thanks guys and stay safe!",1458791597.0

So after trying for a long time, I will finally be getting a subs script. However, there are obviously some conditions; namely, no other opiates in the system showing up in a urine test. The plan is to piss clean, but also to enjoy the little time I have left before doing so.

So the question is, with a mild-moderate tolerance for a habit of sniffing ecp, how much time would you give yourself before stopping completely in order to safely piss clean? In other words, if the ecp were tapered off and then jumped off roughly a week before the test, would that safely be out of urine by then? Or should the ecp be stopped closer to 2 weeks before to be safe?

I know H has a very short half-life, especially sniffed, but would like to play it on the safer side. If it matters, we're talking roughly a couple bags per day for the last month or so (and a long suboxone stretch before that). This has been a long stretch of everyday use for some sort of opioid, whether it be recreational or maintenance.

Thanks in advance for any advice or guidelines for planning a taper, and trying to enjoy a last run of ecp before committing to subs.",1458770617.0

Quick aside, IMO I actually find that most other drugs in withdrawal make me feel worse. For example people talk about benzos making withdrawal easier, and if I had nothing else and had to fully kick, like in jail, I'd take it, but in general benzos just make me more groggy and aren't enough to actually make me sleep (nothing really can actually make me sleep if I'm in full withdrawal mode), so physically I feel worse, even if they help me mentally. maybe it's because I've always had worse physical symptoms than mental. The one exception, and this is rare, is that if you find JUST the right mix of amphetamines and benzos, that actually DOES help, but again it's so hard to find the right balance.

So yeah, anything psychoactive seems like it effects me way more, to the point if being too much if I'm not careful. Whether it's benzos, diphenhydramine (oh god the restless limbs, so awful) or even just caffeine, it hits me way harder when I'm in opioid withdrawal. First time I learned this was early on in my habit, I had to work but I was sick so had no energy and was obviously feeling Shitty. So I took like half a mg of xanax and drank an energy drink to give me some energy to combat the lethargy. It was horrible, I was out if it and could barely stand up, but was jittery, my heart was racing and my stomach was tied up in knots. I was honestly close to just walking off, but I was still keeping up appearances at that point so somehow I got through it.

tl;dr do you notice that other drugs hit you harder when in opioid withdrawal? it's like kicking makes you more sensitive to virtually EVERYTHING: temperature, light, smells, pain, sexual stimulation, and even seemingly drugs.  What do you guys think?",1458769937.0

So now, I pretty much been using daily for 90 days  and got up to 3 buns/day of NY good shit.
Over the past two weeks, I oscillating between trying to quit, a day or two here, and that lowers my tolerance a bit to the point that I only need about 1 bun a day.

So now I'm on day 3 of withdrawal and it really isn't that bad. It's been so much worse coming off 3bun/cold turkey. As hard as it is, cutting down helps ease the withdrawals sooo much.

For example:

We were talking about xanax bars but this applies to pretty much any pill, narcotic or not. Heres our convo:

http://imgur.com/a/pGNby

It just makes 0 sense to me why someone would think this. In regards to US law, doesn't the active chemical/ingredient/whatever in a generic pill ALWAYS have to match its non-generic counterpart? As if you get a generic ""30mg oxy"" and a brand name 30mg oxy, they both will have 30mg oxy, even if the generic(or the brand name) has more filler in it also?(I only say this because I have noticed some 30mg oxys, while always blue, vary in size very slightly sometimes, and I figured that was just because some companies put more filler in with the 30mg oxy than others?)

 Like it doesn't matter what drug it is, 800mg ibuprofen has to be in a pill thats labeled as 800mg ibuprofen, regardless if its generic or brand name, and regardless of how much other filler shit is in there, correct? 

Or is there something that I don't know about the xanax game where they can only put 1.66mg alpralozam in a generic xanax bar and call it a 2mg one? 

Also, in the first pic he says ""whites are usually 20% filler benzo 80% alpralozam"" idk if he means ""filler benzo"" as in like, some weird fake random ""filler benzo"" or if he means the pill composition is 20% filler and 80% benzo. because from what I remember in pill 101, 2mg of powder is next to nothing in size, so a typical 2mg xanax bar would be like 90% ""fillers"" and 10% ""2mg alpralozam powder"" because just how tiny 2mg of any powder really is.

This kid saying this stuff to me is really cool but he is also kinda crazy/a super stoner so I could see someone who doesn't know their shit on this telling him this BS info and him believing it.

Any confirmation that im right(or wrong...but pretty certain i'm right) would be great!

And I know the focus of this is xanax but I also used 30mg oxys as an example in the lower part of our convo I didn't show.",1458920604.0

When I first came around a couple years ago there was a lot of dropping casual n-bombs as a way of trying to be edgy in this really cheesy kind of Tarantino way.  I mean, we wouldn't jam an adrenalin needle in an ODing persons heart when we could just give them Naloxone, so why talk like assholes when we can just be decent people?  One of the biggest issues with it for me was that however ""ironic"" or ""innocent"" anyone wanted to pretend it was, the way that hate speech was being used so casually and flippantly could make a lot of people feel really unwelcome and then that would restrict access to a lot of really important information and harm reduction resources that should be there for everybody.  Also we face so much discrimination, marginalization and straight up hate speech as opiate users, so why would we do this to anybody else? Anyway when I tried to bring up issues with it back then one of the mods (I'm sure anyone who has been around for a while knows who I'm talking about) got really aggressive and in my face, brought up a bunch of tired first amendment excuses, and inspired a whole chorus of fuckbois to drop a bunch more of the offensive language just to rub it in.  Anyway I haven't been seeing nearly as much of the casual racism in recent times, but when I did tonight and I called it out and challenged it I was really pleasantly surprised to see the moderators supporting my position and stating quite clearly ""this shit isn't cool"" Great job mods for standing up for what's right and great job everyone on here for being decent with your language.

I have to share, if this isn't a Junkie Jesus moment idk wtf is <3 so excited.","Hey y'all a little bit about me...  I have been on the streets almost 3 years now. I Am A Working Girl and have been through Hell & Back through my addiction. Rape, ODS of those close and myself,  got no trustworthy, loyal people in my life, went through a horribly abusive relationship for 3 years, cut ties with family at times... I've lost everything I've ever owned, and then I lost it eight more times on the streets. Well I have a good buddy from high school that has always been very understanding and has been there for me ever since I can remember without judging, even though he's not an addict himself. he and I hadn't talked in about a year-and-a-hal, and last night, I gave him my number,  then we talked a little bit about what was going on with me. I told him how I've been wanting to get clean for over a year, but had no options but - try and get into a residential program by waiting on a waiting list, jumping through numerous hoops all while dodging the cops and homeless on the streets. I've been in and out of jail for these past few years. I've been wanting to get clean for a long time now. Well this morning he surprises me and says he has bought me a Greyhound ticket back to her hometown and he's going to let me live with him and his father while I get back on my feet and help me as best he can detox and transition back into normal life. Needless to say I am terrified and excited at the same time I leave Saturday, and I imagine the hardest thing for me is going to learn how to get back into regular living after being homeless for so long, it's going to be hella hard but so worth it.


For me to finally have my own place again, get my dog training business started back up again, have money in the bank and a car earn back trust n devrlop meaningful relationships, have my family back, meaningful and productive hobbies, gain back my desire/motivation to get back into my music and art, let my poor fucked off body heal back into the vixen I was before the streets... maybe be able to once again have fun having sex instead of feeling like its work, address my personal and mental issues, and the list goes on.





 anyway I just really thought you guys could appreciate something like this and send me some words of encouragement because I'm scared shitless. I'll be bringing some Suboxone, Xanax Bars, Lope, weed, and that's it to last as long as a detox off a two month run of .3-.8 BTH and .2 of meth a day. I feel bad because my buddy is full chub over a strict no weed rule  he wants to implement on me. Well I swear by every other rule to be a perfect angel but weed helps me soooo much with all my mental shit and with my body pains, i would be respectful and snesk my tokes outdoors. and there's no way I'm going to be 100% sober the rest of my life... If I do nothing else but weed n smoke cigs I'll be cherry.

over the past 5 months or so i have spent quite a bit of time here reading your posts, comments, conversations, your ups and your downs, the losses and the gains. i have read so many posts about people losing everything, saying they are going to put it down, just to pick up again. I don't understand why it is so hard to quit this damn drug, to just stop getting high. what is different with our brains? why is it when we put this drug in our system do we have a reaction to it like we do, where we will do anything and everything for the high. 

My life isn't bad, it never really was. I had a great upbringing, i was a tough kid in the sense that i was really hyper, got into a ton of shouting matches with my folks, but i was never violent, never abused. I don't really understand where my depression comes from, i have not suffered any traumatic experiences that were not of my own doing. i tried to take my own life 2 years ago with methadone, somehow i survived. i spent two weeks in the hospital with kidney failure and rhabdomyolosis, but i came back and everything went back to normal. i deserved it, i did it to myself, but now i have to live with that. my folks are embarrased by that, my mom told me right after i got out of the hospital ""how am i supposed to tell people when they ask, you dont deserve the sympathy because this was of your own doing?"" they didn't understand how i could feel so low that i would get to that point. 

I thought after that i would be done, i drew a new breath of life, i felt great and had a good job. finally saved some money and bought a car, got a great new job and have a decent bank account. but it is still not enough. i don't even like the feeling anymore, i feel dirty when im high, but i crave it. Why is it when normal people realize something they are doing is destructive they can stop right away, or just avoid it all together, but yet we run towards the chaos. Addiction is like a burning building, everyone is telling us the fire is all around, and we can feel the heat but we just sit there in our favorite chair and turn on the TV. 

I am going to make one final attempt at this. My world has not crashed down around me again....yet, but i can see the cracks in the foundation. i have been getting high on my lunch breaks at work, *oh it will help me work more efficient, i can focus better when i am high*, i can't keep doing that. i want a better life, i don't want this artificial happiness anymore, and i want to know what feelings are like again. 

I fear everything. i am scared child at heart, i see a lot of weakness in me. why can't i beat this? why can't i just put it down and walk away for good. maybe i am just lazy, i havent wanted to put in the work. i know i am stronger than this, i know i am a good person, and i know i can be better. i just want to be done with the excuses. you would think that being on the brink of death would have been enough for me, enough to put it down and walk away. i escaped one fire, walked away with a mere scratch, but the building is starting to heat up again, and this time i have to put out the fire because i have the feeling in the pit of my stomach that i wont be so lucky again. i am stronger than this, we all are, it is there somewhere i just have to find it. i hope by this time next month i will be able to look back at this post and smile, knowing i am in a better place.

Now, I recently happened to get 100mg of Heroin and was wondering if there is a certain amount of time I have to wait after the methadone to take it? Even with low opiate tolerance?

Is there anyway to judge the purity without testing? 
Does it have a higher bioavailability if it is plugged? I refuse to IV and I feel like smoking takes too much time. I know I can snort it but I never know if I'm snorting something right. 

I know a lot of you are more experienced with this kind of thing. I am looking strictly for harm reduction as I need to be careful. What would be an ok starter dose for a big guy (5""10) 250lbs. 

Thank you!

When I draw in my syringe it is brownish this is how I typically know its dope but today when I added it into my cooker and drew it up it was yellow. From Chicago area (no location so I won't be considered sourcing)

Has anyone else had dope that when drew up looked like piss? I mean it was good shit and had some legs on it. It just made me wonder if the cut could be the reason because it at first scared the piss out of me.

I can typically bang two bags of the normal but today I did a bag and was flying high.

Tomorrow when I grab I will post a picture of the color it is in the syringe.

Tldr; typical dope in syringe is lightish brown, today it was yellow like piss. WhT could this be from?

Any help would be amazing. And stay safe my fellow users new or old you should always follow correct harm reduction (cleaning the area, new needles, new cottons, don't share needles) and do test shots. Can't be having ya fools fall out on us.",1458867945.0

They said they didn't have the full amount so they gave her 100 out of the 190 she was supposed to get and told her that if she came back in a week that they would give her the rest of them when they had enough to fill it 1 week from now. I know of the normal law about losing the rest of the pills if you just get them filled partially with narcotics.

So my question is to any pharmacists or pharmacy techs or anybody who has any experience with this type of stuff, are we going to be out those 80 pills or is does the pharmacist have any discretion in deciding to fill the remainder when they have enough? I am well aware that when it comes to narcotics there are no partial fills usually and that is the law, but the pharmacist said to her that since she's a long time customer and brings all her pills there every month for years that they would give her the rest in a week, this was reaffirmed when we called back later and i think it was the tech that said she could pick them up the same time next week when they get a new shipment in.. I am just worried they are saying this now but then are going to change their tune in a week when she goes to pickup the rest and cite the law saying that if you get a partial fill you forfeit the rest of the pills


TLDR- Can a pharmacist use his/her discretion to forgo the normal rule and decide on an individual basis if they want to partially fill a narcotic script for oxycodone now and then fill the rest later on without losing the rest of the pills if the person  is a long time customer?

Anybodys opinion is helpful

Need Help Please.,"I had a knee injury in 2011 that required surgery. Doc placed me on qty.90 10mg norcos a month. That worked for a few months, but then I found myself running out before my re-fill date. It started out a few days early and then about 1-2 weeks I was done. I had to hit the streets to make up for the 2 weeks I was out. 

About a year ago I lost my job down to re-sizing and thus lost my doctor and insurance. I have been using about 100-120mg of hydrocodone or oxycodone for the last 4 years. I finally said enough is enough. I could not afford them and I did not want to be on opiates any longer. I have someone that I can get a constant supply of Methadones from and while I don't want to get hooked on Methadones I def. want off these Norcos and Oxycodone.

I ran out of Norcos last Wednesday Night. the next morning I took 2 10mg Methadone pills in the morning 3/17/16 at 8am. This lasted all day. I did not feel an urge or w/d at all. 

Friday Morning same time, I took 2 more 10mg methadone pills and again all day no feeling of urges or desires. I also am sleeping fine.

Saturday morning I get up and I think maybe I don't need to take qty.2 10mg methadone pills. so I started taking just 1 methadone pill a day. This has been what I have been doing ever since. So for the last 5 days I am just taking 1 methadone in the morning and not anything else. I also want to add I acquired some 30mg oxy pills that someone owed me. I have had those for 3 days now and I have not touched them. I have not had the desire, so why take it if I don't have the craving. I am trying to get off them anyway. I know it's the methadone why I am not wanting them so that is good.

I don't want to feel any withdraw feelings at all, and I don't want to get hooked on these methadones either because I hear it's worse. Is it pretty good that I am not feeling any feeling of w/d after a solid week of ZERO norcos and only 1 pill a day of dones?

I also am sleeping just fine without taking sleeping aids of any kind. should I wait a week and then maybe take 1/2 pill a day?
and then another week or so and take less? Maybe I wont get hooked on methadones in that short of a time-frame(hoping).

Please someone help me. there is a lot of mis-leading information I am finding when I am doing my research",1458856855.0

I was sick as hell, 2AM, going to meet someone to score. I'm on a highway, getting ready to pull onto the interstate in a few miles. As I approached the stoplights before my on-ramp, I realise that 2 stoplights in a row are not working so I slowed down, hesitated,  and made sure the coast was clear anf drove thru them. Noone has ever told me what to do in that situation before and they still didn't tell me what to do. The cop said to just ignore it but my lawyer said treat it as a yield sign. 

So I pull onto the onramp...feeling like death at this point, and I see the headlights behind me. FUCK. I'm not riding dirty but I must look very suspicious.  2am, alone, sickly, driving 30 mintues away from my town in a not so nice part of town. Cop comes up and asks me why I hesistated at the stoplights. I explain my point of view and he goes back and mustve called for backup. Second cop shows up and asks me to step out of the car. They explain they are suspicious that I'm drunk or on drugs. I pass the breathylizer and it kinda upset the secod cop. He became aggressive and demanded I give him my drugs. I DIDNT HAVE ANY THUS WHY IM IN THIS SITUATION. He explains that I'm being taken to the hostipal for a blood test. Obviously I pop dirty for heroin, benzos and weed. It has since snowballed cuz I couldn't pay the fines and I've ended up with 2 addition driving on a suspended to get to and from work. I've been fired both times as I no called, no showed and don't have reliable transportation.

Fucking bullshit cuz, yes I probably looked sketchy and seemed like I was up to no good BUT I WASNT HIGH, I WAS THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF HIGH! So I spent the night in jail sick, pissed that I didn't get high as fuck and then get pulled over, since it ended the same either way.

I'm not completely sure, but I don't think I'd be so against it. I'm quite liberal, I think people should be able to make their own decisions as to what goes into their body, and yet, I see on this very sub the problems that come with this attitude.

The feelings of nothingness, euphoria, peace and stillness of my mind was unlike anything I've ever experienced. 
I had truly felt the ultimate gift of tranquility and for the first time in my life I wasn't worried about anything.

The shy, anxiety ridden kid who never fit in finally perceived the world in a whole different realm. It was as if I was floating on my back in the middle of the ocean staring up at a moon lit sky with the unknown below me. 

I felt helpless and vulnerable, however, I was completely  at peace with my emotions. I never felt a happiness like it and nothing will ever replace it. It's the main reason I feel like I'll be an addict the rest of my life and the only way I'll ever be happy is if I'm nodding off. 
The world could be in flames and facing imminent death and I would be at peace with myself. I'm 41 and have been in it deep for  around 23 years. I've been through countless rehabs and have tried multiple medications..... subs, methadone but nothing gives me the solitude in which dope grants me. 
I feel myself getting tired of hustling, lying and all around ""shitbagery"" but then, as usual, I find myself back in the same spot I had been the previous day and my thoughts and feelings revert back to the daydream i wish never to end.

Elliot Smith : A fond Farewell 

The Litebrite's now black and white
'Cos you took apart a picture that wasn't right

Pitch burning on a shining sheet
The only maker that you want to meet,
A dying man in a living room
Whose shadow paces the floor

Who'll take you out in the open door
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend

It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
A fond farewell to a friend

He said really I just want to dance
Good and evil match perfect, it's a great romance

And I can deal with some psychic pain
If it'll slow down my higher brain

Veins full of disappearing ink
Vomiting in your kitchen sink

Disconnecting from the missing link

This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
I'ts just a fond farewell to a friend

Who couldn't get things right
A fond farewell to a friend

I see you're leaving me
And taking up with the enemy

The cold comfort of the in-between
A little less than a human being
A little less than a happy high
A little less than a suicide

The only things that you really tried
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend

Who couldn't get things right
A fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend

----------






Hey y'all a little bit about me... I have been on the streets almost 3 years now. I  have lead a prety rough life, even for an addict.  True, 90% of my problems are self inflicted, and i accept that. ... But i know that my being a working girl is at least 80% the fault of my ex, how he did fucked up things to me, systematically destroying my life separating me from family and friends and abusing me...  He robbed me and my family a yr or two ago  and because of that  my family didn't trust me .  Right after that happened , he got me locked up  by snitching on me to the fuzz (2nd time he's done that). I lost my job  and when I got out of jail  I came out with nothing  but the clothes on my back  I had no choice  trick  or starve  being homeless on the streets.  he was gone  of course  and I had nobody to turn to  no money  no possessions  since he stole it all. I also had no job  nowhere to go ... I've already been there  and I told myself back then  I wasn't about to let myself starve or be cold  or sleep out on the sidewalk during winter  if I could ever help it  so I took my ass  to the track and started this career as a prostitute . i have been through Hell & Back through my addiction. Rape, overdoses of those close and myself, got no trustworthy, loyal people in my life, went through a horribly abusive relationship for 3 years, cut ties with family at times... I've lost everything I've ever owned, and then I lost it eight more times on the streets. Well I have a good buddy from high school that has always been very understanding and has been there for me ever since I can remember without judging, even though he's not an addict himself. he and I hadn't talked in about a year-and-a-hal, and last night, I gave him my number, then we talked a little bit about what was going on with me. I told him how I've been wanting to get clean for over a year, but had no options but - try and get into a residential program by waiting on a waiting list, jumping through numerous hoops all while dodging the cops and homeless on the streets. I've been in and out of jail for these past few years. I've been wanting to get clean for a long time now. Well this morning he surprises me and says he has bought me a Greyhound ticket back to her hometown and he's going to let me live with him and his father while I get back on my feet and help me as best he can detox and transition back into normal life. Needless to say I am terrified and excited at the same time I leave Saturday, and I imagine the hardest thing for me is going to learn how to get back into regular living after being homeless for so long, it's going to be hella hard but so worth it.
For me to finally have my own place again, get my dog training business started back up again, have money in the bank and a car earn back trust n develop meaningful relationships, have my family back, meaningful and productive hobbies, gain back my desire/motivation to get back into my music and art, let my poor fucked off body heal back into the vixen I was before the streets... maybe be able to once again have fun having sex instead of feeling like its work, address my personal and mental issues, and the list goes on.
anyway I just really thought you guys could appreciate something like this and send me some words of encouragement because I'm scared shitless. I'll be bringing some Suboxone, Xanax Bars, Lope, weed, and that's it to last as long as a detox off a two month run of .3-.8 BTH and .2 of meth a day. I feel bad because my buddy is full chub over a strict no weed rule he wants to implement on me. Well I swear by every other rule to be a perfect angel but weed helps me soooo much with all my mental shit and with my body pains, i would be respectful and snesk my tokes outdoors. and there's no way I'm going to be 100% sober the rest of my life... If I do nothing else until my dying day but weed n smoke cigs I'll be cherry.

4bznet,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4bznet/is_there_any_practical_difference_between_short/,12,https://redd.it/4bznet,zjciprazz,Is there any practical difference between short and long acting opiates when it comes to how long and intense withdrawal is?,"It seems like people talk about suboxone and methadone withdrawal being worse because of the longer half life, but what I'm curious about is whether or not switching to a shorter acting opiate before stopping would actually make a difference or if it's just pseudoscience that sounds plausible. 



Based on what I know about addiction there would be to things to think about when it comes to this question: 1. Is the half life of the drug you are taking, because the longer it takes to leave your system, the longer it takes you to get to the point where you are in peak withdrawal, which I would imagine doesn't happen until the substance is completely out of your system. 2 would be the actual effect the drug has on dopamine shutdown. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but opiate withdrawal occurs because when you trigger the receptors artificially, with something delivered from outside of the body, the brain stops producing the feel good chemicals that naturally occur. When you stop introducing them via drugs, the brain needs some time to start up production again. This time is what you feel as withdrawal. 



Assuming my knowledge stated above is correct, my assumption would be that if you switch to a shorter acting opiate, your body would enter withdrawal much faster than if you stopped while taking the longer acting one. My question is, although it may allow you to enter withdrawal faster, would the neurotransmitter shutdown be affected, or at that point if you are already shut down, does the brain not know the difference? There may be a difference in withdrawal severity from only using heroin vs only using suboxone, but can this severity change if you go from one to the other. 



My main reason for asking this question is that I'm trying to figure out if there are any good strategies for getting off suboxone, and to understand the withdrawal process better in general. I know switching from suboxone to a shorter acting opiate like hydrocodone or heroin is playing with fire, because you run the risk of slipping back into addictive behaviours and abusing the drug. For the sake of simplicity,  I'd like to operate under the assumption this is a lab study scenario. Whether or not it would work is different than whether or not it's a good idea for most people.

I (honestly) don't have  much experience experience filling narcotic pain medications. I'm on oxycodone 5/325 3x PRN. I.... Use it as prescribed. 

So anyway, I got another script, without even thinking, I dropped it off to be filled. I don't have any left in my existing script, doc knows this, that's why he wrote another script so the pharmacy tech calls me over and she looks confused as fuck (like she's in trouble). It was filled and about to be released to me and they had a little congregation behind the desk. I was told that it would be released after the weekend and that they couldn't give it to me because of the existing meds (that I should have according to old script) and insurance reasons. OK - that sucks - weekend without meds, anyway.

Questions are..

1) did they fill it on accident and go ""oh shit! I fucked up"" when they saw that it was early??

2) am I being flagged at my PCP now as trying to early refill?

3) can I go pick it up and refill it somewhere else with cash and tell the pharmacy that I have no insurance and fill it? (I told them to fill it - just curious for future)

TL,DR:
 I was arrested for NOT illegally disposing of old syringes. They were in proper disposal containers waiting for the day the local exchange was open so I could get rid of them properly. 

 This new, ""going to rid the earth of all the drug scum"" cop sees me outside my house working on my landlords car, and recognizes me from a year or so ago, when he was an explorer (piglet in training). A probation search was done at my house by another officer who is cool enough to understand my intentions of harm reduction. As long as I dont waste his time by lying or generally being an asshole, in return he turns a blind eye to small stuff like syringes, weed, scales, ect. 

Anyways, piglet and cool cop do their search, turn up nothing but syringes that are being disposed of, new ones in bags, and some narcan. Cool cop says ""ok, have a good night"" that's when piglet gets sand in his vagina and begins to protest, ""its people like him who are enabling others(its known that I give away clean supplies to whoever needs), probably kids, to shoot up we need to be after"". Cool cop disagrees and says to me, "" he's new, he doesn't get it yet"". 

Cut to last Wednesday, piglet is now a full on cop, sees me outside and sneaks up on me. I dont know how long he was standing there, I was under the car when he approached but as I get up, he snatches my arm and twists it behind my back to cuff me. Naturally I begin to fight off the surprise attack. That's when I am slammed up against the car and says, ""resisting arrest and assaulting police officer! Your making my job too easy!"" And I am cuffed. 

I ask him, realizing who and what he is, what's the deal and that I wasnt resisting, his sneak attack just caught me off guard and instinct kicked in. I am trying to cooperate as much as possible while holding back the rage building inside me. He sits me down on cement in my garage, right next to a perfectly good chair, and starts asking me stupid ass flat footed, gum shoe questions. All the while searching around looking for his big bust but coming up empty. He threatens to bring a dog in to find what I am hiding and I say go a head there's nothing more than old syringes. (I'm out of new )

The motherfucker tries to get the k9 unit out to my place but I guess the dog has the day off. Instead calls for back up so he can go inside and thrash my place. I breathed a sigh of relief when his back up arrived and it was none other than cool cop. While piglet is upstairs I ask cool cop what the hell is this guys deal? He quietly tells me that ""he's just a dick with a hard on for the badge"" and that he's not liked by the other officers because of his attitude. We both laugh and he asks me genuine questions about how I am, my girlfriend (who's in jail actually), and my fixed gear bike. (That's how we got to know each other, he is a fellow rider and was impressed with my bike )  

After a few minutes of shooting the shit, Piglet comes out with the syringe containers and tells me to stand up,  says to cool cop ""sorry to interrupt your date"" and that he's taking me in. Cool cop asks why and Piglet replies ""all these needles, that's why."" In disbelief Cool cop laughs saying are you really going to arrest him for those? You know your going to have to count everyone of them. And they will just release him once he sees a judge, its barely a V.O.P. at most, but overall its just unnecessary.  

Piglet gets visibly upset that cool cop is questioning his judgment, in front of me no less, and says something like "" you shouldn't baby these scumbags""  He is also convinced of some other motives for having the needles because ""I would/should of just thrown them away"" someone who does drugs doesn't care about things like other peoples safety or the environment. I must be lying and up to something. 

Long story shortened up is in spite of cool cops rational he takes me in, I wait two hours before I am transported to county, 8 hours later finally booked, 12 hours before I get to a bed, see a judge Thursday morning, get the case thrown out because I hadn't done anything illegal. Get processed out Thursday night, but looked over and not released till Friday afternoon. 


 Fuck that cop, I hope he shoots himself in the balls during a gun safety demonstration at a school.  Or his bitch tits get cancer and rot off. There's nothing more infuriating than abuse of power, especially while powerless. 

I respect all cops until they prove themselves unworthy. In my small town they are, for the most part, normal jack offs who will actually cut you loose as long as you don't waste their time, or you're not hurting yourself or others. Its the new cops, who came from out of town, who are giving the cops here a bad wrap. And they are multiplying like rats. 



 can try and jam me up, but they will never stop me from making sure clean rigs and narcan are available to all who need.

Heroin has always been one of those drugs beyond my ""line"" of being comfortable with. I don't plan on trying it, or at the least any time soon.

But I have tried other opiates and opioids. Oxy, Percocet, Vicodin, kratom, and currently poppy seed tea. I really want to enjoy these drugs, but I just don't really get them. 

For example, I'm currently using poppy seed tea (made with 150g of good quality seeds, but probably made shittily as it was my first time). I have a bit of a head high, and I'm a little 'stumbly' and much slower mentally. I'm a little nauseous and a little itchy. My heart rate is also very noticeably lower than usual (usually like mid 80s, now low 70s). I mostly just feel uncomfortable, I don't really enjoy this. The high that opiates are described as seems like something I would really enjoy, but it's just not.

Does this mean I wouldn't enjoy heroin? Again, that's not something I'm going to find out anytime soon or ever. It's just one of those questions I ask myself as a budding drug user. What do you guys think?",1459056981.0

SO now, little man, you're tired of grass,
L.S.D., Acid, Cocaine, and hash. 
When someone pretending to be a true friend, 
Said, I'll introduce you to Miss Heroin. 
Well Honey, before you start fooling with me,
Let me inform you on just how it will be. 
For I will seduce you and make you my slave,
For I've sent stronger men than you straight to their graves.
You'd think you could never be such a disgrace,
Then you'll end up addicted to poppy seed waste.
You'll start by inhaling me one afternoon,
Then you'll take me into your arms very soon. 
Once I've entered deep down in your veins,
The craving inside will drive you INSANE.
You'll need lots of money (haven't you already been told?)
For darling, I am more expensive than gold. 
You'll swindle your mother for less than a buck,
You'll end up an animal, vile and corrupt.
You'll beg and you'll steal for my narcotic charm,
And only feel content when I'm deep in your arm. 
One day you'll realize the monster I've grown,
And solemnly promise to leave me alone. 
If you think you have the magical knack,
Honey, just try getting me off your back.
The vomit, the cramps, your guts in a knot,
The jangling nerves screaming just one more shot. 
The hot chills, the cold sweats, the withdrawal pains,
Can only be eased by my little white China grain.
There is no other way, and no need to look,
For deep down inside you'll know you are hooked.
You'll desperately run to the pusher and then,
You'll welcome me back to your veins once again. 
And when you return, as I have foretold,
You'll ultimately give me your body and soul. 
You'll give up your morale, your conscious, your heart,
And then you'll be mine til death do us part.

Just looking for a fun discussion on times you got lucky you didn't get locked up or funny/crazy experiences with cops,"This will be kind of long but it is one of my lucky/funny cop stories (I have a few, ill tell on request, if not and this is lame ill keep them to myself) 
Anyways this was several years ago and me and my friend were at a party and I was getting pretty hammered (I was under 21 at the time) as was he, but he was legally able to drink. After a while of partying there me and my friend decide we are going to ditch this party and walk about 4 miles down the road to another party we heard about. We got maybe a third of the way before a car stopped because they recognized my friend and asked us if we wanted a ride. We were pretty messed up and had a while left to walk so we agreed.
They took us down the road and dropped us off in front of the house where the party was. We got out of the car, thanked them, and stumbled towards the house.
Before we got there though, a black sedan rolled up and four old guys got out. Our first thought was that they were just some old guys looking for chicks, but one of them asks if we have been drinking. My friend (again of legal age) replies with ""oh I'm hammered drunk!"" The men then pull out their badges, they are of course under cover cops. They then ask for his I'D and one asks me if I've been drinking. Barely able to stand straight I say no so he pulls me aside, checks my ID and upon seeing that I'm not 21 decides to do a sobriety check.
The officer tells me to follow his finger with my eyes and to not turn my head. First attempt: turn my head. He warns me again not to turn my head. Second attempt: turn my head.
""No, don't turn your head"" says the officer. Third attempt: turn my head.
""Ok, you're good"" says the officer.
""Really?"" I say in disbelief, I even knew I failed it. (3 times)
""Ya you're good, you guys going to that party right there?""
""Yeah, I mean should we? Or are you guys going to break it up?"" I ask.
""No its a party go have phone, but if you guys smoke dope or something call us"" the officer says and they get in their car and leave.
The same cops ended up breaking up a party down the road and giving out 40 MIP's. I have no idea why he let me go, but I was extremely lucky, considering I had an 8ball of coke in my pocket.

Ive now been sober 3 months or so, following yet another year long period of living on the street there, this time with no car, after having a bad wreck after my jail stent...
Ive honestly got it made here, got my own house, money, and car when my licence is reinstated next week, and a scooter until then.
Even though im SO fortunate to have all this im still wanting to get high again. I was on the needle for 4 years. 
Im just not happy here...i have no friends and sit in this house all day with no contact with anybody what so ever. Im becoming so depressed all over again, and even though it would be the worst decision i could make i still want to. Im conflicted. the junkie in me tells me the bad/good times with friends and companions were better then this loneliness and boredom and sadness, and even though i know it isnt true, im still driven to want to go back. 
At least a friend would make it better, but im quite shy when i dont have my dope, so its hard...

Sorry if im rambling, whining, or whatever. I know it all sound so stupid and selfish. I just really needed to tell at least somebody...
Any advice from yall?

I'm curious about what have been you guys' experiences giving other people their first shot of heroin or whatever other opiates.

Did it take you some convincing? Any regrets? Experiences that stand out? 

Personally a month ago I fucked up well giving my almost opiate naive ex a shot that almost killed him. We hadn't seen each other for a few months and during that time I'd started mainlining. Now, I came to visit him, and he didn't want me to IV at his place. He insisted that I only smoke with him, and gave me what I considered to be a really shitty ultimatum - if I wanted to IV i'd have to shoot him too. 

I didn't plan on shooting him up, but I hoped that if he saw me cooking the dope, preparing the rigs etc that would put him off. I prepared one that was a third of the other, but really I planned to get both shots into my arm, and then be like ""come on dudee, you really thought I was gonna do it? nope."" Anyways after my first shot the plan went out of the window. He kept presenting me his arm and pushing me to do it, so I thought ""fuck it, I guess you really want it or you wouldn't be insisting like that"", and there it went. Ironically as I was pushing on the plunger he told me that he hoped that he'd overdose, so that I'd learn my lesson - shit was messed up.

He fell out almost instantly. Waiting for the ambulance to arrive was a fucking nightmare; giving him CPR, facing the prospect of having to live with the fact that I literally killed my best friend from childhood, all I could think apart from ""please be ok"" was that if he didn't make it I'd inject the 2 remaining grams and try and off myself too. Paramedics made it on time and he's perfectly fine, pphhew. 

I probably deserve a good fucking slap for endangering someone else's life like that, but trust me I feel terrible enough as it is, no matter how much he did mess with my head, there's no fucking excuse. Not surprisingly he broke up with me a few days later, our relationship had been more than rocky for a very long time but yeah, almost homicide was probably a deal breaker lol. 

So yeah, let's read your shooting other people stories!

Another suggestion would be ""Night of the Gun"" by David Carr about his wild coke and heroin abuse. It takens you for quite the wild ride and is quite entertaining throughout.  This is more respectably written and got better reviews but reviews aren't everything.

The only problem is being sober is just killing me im so fucking depressed and emotional all the time im always crying about something to my parents or im just panicing and over thinking things with friends and when I talk to girls and they end up thinking im such a weirdo/creep. Im sooo so tired of being alone. I feel like I don't have any friends. 

But none of this stuff bothered me when I had my best friend my needle in my hand and my lovely girl dope by my side. When I was high on dope i didn't care about getting laid or having friends I never tried and because I never came off as trying I often did have many friends and I would get laid because I was laid back and seemed chill when really I was too stoned to care. Now I just come off so needy and clingy to everyone and I hate it so much. 

But at the same time I hated myself on dope because I was throwing my life away and wasting all my potiental and all my hard work I did to get my degree and work experience. I also want to get my life together and make my friends and family proud. I want a great job and to settle down one day and have myself a beautiful wife and kids/family of my own and I know that's no possible with dope still in the picture. 

I already lost the love of my life, the best prettiest most caring girl I've ever met because of dope. She gave me so many chances but I kept thinking I could have it all her and dope. I kept sneaking it on the side getting high whenever she wasn't around.  But the fucked up part is I only probably got her to begin with because I was high all those times we first met. I know a girl like that would of never fallen in love with the real me. Opiates made me the best me. When I was high I could be funny and charming and so laid back and cool in front of a girl that would make my heart race a million miles an hour. 

She helped me get off opiates (at that time of my life junior year of college I was only on oxy doing 100mg a day selling weed by the pound to support myself.) she was so happy at first that I kicked pills for her but as time went on and slowly over the next few months she got to see the real me and slowly all the reasons that she feel in love with me dissapeared and she no longer loved me anymore after a few months. 

I later relapsed and started doing dope and I keep realizing the same thing that people only seem to like me when im high, along with myself. Idk what to do. I hate it so much I wish I could be the person I am on opiated but im just not. without opiates I can't find the motivation to do anything and lay around in bed all day. I find myself just counting the days go by hoping this is only a phase and one day I'll be able to be that confident person without opiates. But it's just not helping and the more I think about it the more I realize that person never existed while sober. I only ever was funny outgoing and shit once I started taking painkillers. Opiates make me the best me. And I hate that so so much. It hurts so much inside that now im also coming to that same realization as my ex I also don't love this person that is me not on opiates. I can't see things ever changing either and if they do I don't have the first clue how to go about it. 

 .

Damn sorry for the rant didn't realize it was so long. to sum it all up opiates let me be the person I want to be socially and I hate who I am sober but then I have so much potential in life and on dope im throwing it all away and I hate myself for that. I just hate myself no matter what and can't figure out what to do.

Edit: thank you all so much to everyone that posted. This community is really the best thing I have ever found out about. You all have such huge hearts. I've always said that addicts like us got addicted to painkillers in the first place because we all seem to have such big and soft hearts so it's hard to handle how cruel the world out there can be at times without something to numb the hurt and pain. Your responses have really touched me deeply. I went and had a talk with my parents who are some of my biggest supporters and I went and cried for awhile and cried reading these posts and feel a million times better thanks again to you all. 

Peace love and good vibes to you and all your loved ones. ",1459118036.0

Texted him three times saying dude your shits fake no response but wait there's more.
Next morning this fucker calls me and says that I OWE HIM FUCKING MONEY. He says he can't pawn it and that he wants cash, little did he know I was waiting for that fucker to say some shit like that cause I still have 7 bags left. I was like oh yeah? Well I still got your cinimom or whatever the hell do you can give me my tv and laptops back. He says he doesn't want the bags he wants the money.
At this point I was just thinking he was fucking crazy.  I told him same shit and that I knew they were fake then I told him to come down and bang one of them and see how that goes. He obviously denied and said he still wanted the money WHICH MADE NO FUCKING SENSE.
I was like dude at least you came out on top I'm here with no shit and my nose is practically ruined. He keeps bugging me saying he wants the cash. Just kept saying take your shit back and he said ""it is dope your just a broke faggot I don't want those bags you probably mess with them."" I told him they were still as was when he fucking handed them to me. 
He finally stopped threatening me and stopped texting me all together thank fucking God, I hate that fucker so much. Beats me then tries to threaten me TO GET FREE MONEY AFTER HE TOOK MY ELECTRONICS.

How's everyone this fine and beautiful afternoon hope everyone is well and not suffering through lack of funds which always sucks but there's always ways of making money . If you put your thinking cap on . 

So I picked up a half G and some done but I'll be saving that for next week when the cash flow starts to trickle . I'll have about 300 ml of methadone to fall back on and I can do a reduction over 4/5 days and avoid basically all the physical symtoms . As I've done it many times in the past to have a break . The mental side is still there and you'll be thinking of going for a bit all the time you just need to stay strong . 

  So I did the first half earlier in the morning then did some house work hoovering ,taking the dogs for a walk etc. When I went to do the other half it wasn't box 😬 Or next to my TV . Then I thought about hoovering and I might have lost it and I'd chucked the waste in the wheely bin . After about 10 minutes searching I managed to find it !! It was in the crack between the arm of the couch and the back cushion !! 😄 Thank fuck for that ! So I put the rock on the spoon and cook it up with the little citric I have as all the chemists where shut over Easter . I was going to get some more supplies I even took my sin bin in with me . But as I was going to the chemist at the top of the town the bus came so thought fuck it ! And jumped on the bus . Ill get stuff tomorrow as I need to go into town tomorrow anyway so I'll pick up 20/30 sets and that should keep me going for a while . I've had to use some of my needles 2 or three times and I marked what ones I'd used more than once as the needles have letters and numbers you can easily scratch off to help you identify your works if your in a group of people (As seen in the pic )  . I got my self first time and registered which is alway good I hate when you get blood in the tool and can't get yourself as you start panicking it's going to congeal and waste the hit . Not bad for IVing for 15 years though and remember always rotate your sites !! And minimise the risk of collapsed veins . So I'm going to roll a joint (White Siberian) and maybe down load a film or watch Netflix and chill .

I then thought ""fuck it, if I'm gonna do this I'm gonna DO this"". I bought more high-quality/expensive casual clothes, got myself a suitably-modern-but-still-""appropriate"" business haircut like all the other douche 'young professional's, and started making sure I shaved every day and trimmed up that haircut.

I got in a car today with my middleman and a couple of his friends to do a quick drive-down-the-block deal. I realized just how much I stuck out from them, when just a year ago I would have looked like one of the gang. I'm just this extremely clean-cut, primped-up businesss-looking guy. I look exactly like the type of people I hate.

But you know what? I always get the benefit of the doubt. People see me sketchily waiting around and just assume that my business is legitimate. I've been pulled over twice in the past year and both times the cop was nice, even humorous about my ""straight-edge guy who is so scared he's gonna get a ticket"" routine. None of the ""you don't have any dead bodies in there, do you? haha! Mind if I look?"" line that I've gotten so many times in the past. I fucking love it.

Does anyone else here make an effort to look as blandly ordinary as possible? When I see pictures here, I see a lot of tattoos and crazy hair which I think are fantastic looking 95% of the time, but do not lend themselves to blending in. Granted, I feel like the people who are more likely to get the crazy hair or get obvious tattoos are probably more likely to post pictures showing them off, so I may have a biased sample. 

But yeah, looking like a square: highly recommended. Even if you are just hustling as grimily as you can, a clean oxford with a white tee underneath and some slacks/khakis keep you much safer in terms of nosy normies and the law.",1459223885.0

I know it sounds so weak and pathetic, but I just can't imagine surviving without opiates. Of course, I can't imagine surviving with them, either, but I just feel so emotionally stunted and I can't handle shit like the adult that I am. I'm afraid of everything, and I can't function like a normal human being. It makes me want to jump in front of a damn train; I fantasize about killing myself constantly- have for years- and truly believe that the only way I'll ever be free of this fucking addiction is by dying... It's just a matter of how much I can take before I am too exhausted. 

It's kind of funny because right now I'm using less than ever- my habit is *nothing* compared to what it was this time last year, or even a few months ago, but I'm just getting so *tired*. I isolate, I avoid, and I'm so depressed that I can't even put it into words. I can't articulate the emotional pain I'm struggling with, or the crazy, awful thoughts constantly running through my mind that have been there for as long as I can remember.

I'm being crushed by guilt. 99% of the time my anxiety is crippling. I can't connect with anyone and I'm beyond lonely. I have trouble moving past the abuse and awful shit from my past that has fucked me up in various ways that seem irreparable. And yes I realize this post is pathetic as fuck but I feel compelled to write it because I'm such a loser I have no one in my life that I can talk to honestly, since all I do is lie and hide shit and bottle everything up. 

And yet, day in and day out my ""friends"" (they really are great people but the trust they have in me is a farce on my end) congratulate me on my clean time, ask me where I get my energy and how I'm always so happy? Tell me my happiness and attitude are contagious... And it makes me feel even more suffocated. I don't even know how or why I put that front up. Customers tell me they love that I'm always smiling, my co workers who don't know much at all about me tell me things like ""I wish life hadn't kicked my ass to the point where I can't be that happy anymore, I hope you never lose it"" but little do they know... 

I could go on forever but even writing this is exhausting. Thinking is exhausting. Fuck.",1459220604.0

I recently switched over to dope to save money and try to skimp. I have had dope that was ""weak"" that I needed to do like half the bag to feel anything. Later I realized that maybe this was fire. A different stamp I get has me slightly nodding out after like 2 lines and I can get about 8 lines from a bag. 

Anyway just a few hours ago I got 4 bags of ECP from Popular Philly area and it was not stamped but bagged up normally and from a familiar place. Dudes I copped from were older and sketchy looking but seemed cool enough. The dude that served me was definitely a fiend. The dude that gives it to them to serve leaves shortly after I cop 4 and some other folks get some too. I call dude that is usually there and he says he had day off and I am straight. Long story short I get home and look at it and it looks legit. It's like a light gray powder that kind of sticks together (same as always). I am skeptical and only snort the small amount of powder leftover on my fingertips from cleaning it up and putting back in the bag. Like not even a 20th of a bag.  Usually that spot has a stamp ""walking dead"" but it was bagged up in glassine and plastic baggies like normal. 15 minutes later I get this weird rush like in my belly and seemingly euphoric but it also scares me because all my other dope doesn't do this much rush business. I get in the car quickly and head down the street to 7/11 (short drive) thinking I should be in public instead of alone in this house. I feel sedated and my hearing seems turned down and shit seems more colorful. Like some after school special shit no joke but also my breathing is labored (this also barely happens with other dope). I sit in the parking lot and buy a slurpee later it's hard to keep my balance kind of but I'm not nodding. At no point do I feel an intense desire to nod. I feel just maybe a little nausea. 

I decide to go back home after 20 minutes or so and I get inside and pace around the house. After about an hour my breathing is still labored and I'm sweaty as fuck but I have one of those blood oxygen meter things for your finger and it says my oxygen level is like 96% but heart rate is like 120. It's been about 2 hours now and I feel like I'm coming down oxygen is 96% heart rate down to like 90. My pupils were not super pinned but pinned. 

So was that some fire dope and I had a total panny or maybe it was  a fent cut?  I took so little and it had that effect. I can't imagine doing a line and how that would feel. What do you think?  I've read that fent has no euphoria and no legs and super respiratory depression due to too much used in cut. I am not even chasing the dragon these days. Just use for slight buzz and staying well and planning save money vs pills and taper down also. 

TL;DR - Did I do a lucky test shot of Fent or do I have strong dope? Because I felt euphoria, labored breathing, hard to balance, no nod (but maybe I was fighting it) and seem to be coming down 2-3 hrs later. ",1459201274.0

However, I did a quick scan and didn't see any on the first couple pages AND this is mainly just for me to offer up the best advice I've ever taken in an attempt to help ya'll, just maybe, cast away the many minutes (or hours! ha ha) spent nodding in the bathroom, praying your bladder will finally get to work. :-)

I have tried countless tips and tricks from sitting, to attempting to massage my bladder, to tickling my lower back (really, if you name it, I've probably tried it) with varying degrees of success. Recently I was lurking around different areas of this sub and I stumbled upon a tip that resulted in damn near instant relief. When you read it, some of you will probably just think ""well, duh"" while others will be shocked that they never thought to try it. Also, considering the fact that we're all different, I'm sure some of you will have tried this trick to no avail. But, like I said, it worked so friggin' well for me, I just had to share!

Anyway, this great mystery tip/trick that I have somehow built up over two paragraphs of hype (ha ha, oops) is: PUT YOUR HAND UNDER WARM, RUNNING WATER! That's it! I know, it seems super simple and I had tried multiple little ""hacks"" in a similar vein to it, but this worked INSANELY well for me. 

The other day I could feel that my bladder was full but I could also tell I wasn't anywhere near the point of a successful whizz, regardless, I went and stood in front of the toilet in the hopes of a miracle. I stood there for a few seconds with zero promise of leaving anytime soon and remembered that I had read about putting my hand under warm, running water. I figured it made sense considering the old high school prank where you do something similar to a sleeping friend and make them wet the bed. Now, it did take some slightly creative bending on my part, and my water went from cold to luke warm to scalding hot quicker than the freakin' Flash. So, I had to mess around with sink a bit to get it to the (roughly) correct temperature and within SECONDS I could feel my bladder gears beginning to turn. While this was a success all on its on,  a few moments later I was straight up pissing away as if I had no inhibitions what-so-ever. 

So, that's it! Ha ha. I'm sorry for the hella lengthy post. I definitely could've edited a bunch out (like, this section for example, ha ha) but someone is feeling very wordy today. Ha ha. Anyhoo... has anyone else had AMAZING results from this ""Opiate Pee Hack""? Ha ha. I've used this little trick a few times now and have had a 100% success rate. Perhaps one of the reasons (just one of 'em, ha ha) I'm so chatty is due to the fact that I'm HELLA excited at the prospect of no longer wasting so much time slumped over in front of the toilet! Unless of course I'm using a dreadful public toilet. Ha ha.

Anyway, I surely hope this works as well for the rest of you all as it did for me. Feel free to let me know!

How are things today ? Hope everyone is good and no one is WD through lack of funds . 

So today I get up feeling abit rough as my last hit was 6pm the day before . So start getting ready make a coffee ,quick wash ,hair done etc . Down my coffee and out the door . Go to the post office and withdraw some funds and walk over to the bus stop where the bus comes in about 2 minutes and I've timed it perfectly 😊 

  I go to my usual place where I've been scoring for about 2 months but she's shouting an hour 😐 But I sure as shit can't wait that long . Just as I'm leaving a woman and her son come into the close and I tell her she has nothing and she asks me if I know anyone else close by . I tell her yeah I know a guy just a couple of minutes away from here so I jump into her taxi with her and her son who must only be about 15 😁 Great parenting there ! I also tell her that the guy doesn't do half G only £10 bags but they are pretty decent and she says that's cool . The driver stops at the flat and me and her get out and chap the door . His missus answers and they've got 😊 The woman introduces her self and asks if it's OK to come regularly and I think she gets 3 tenner bags and she leaves . My dealer shouts through asking if I want to sit for abit and have a hit . Which I agree to and get some citric etc and fish out a old tool from my sin bin and have a hit . I sit for a little bit talking about the usual shit and I end up walking over with him as he wants to get a pair of Levi's and a top . I leave him in the centre of town and head to the chemist for fresh supplies . Then as I'm coming out I see my bus leaving the bus garage . So I take a little jog to the high street and the bus comes I a couple of minutes . I get home and cook up a charge and that's been my day so far 😀

What should I know?,"I have decided it's time quit the boy and most likely every other drug. I've tried abstinence on multiple occasions, but even when I am provided professional help, an excellent recovering community, severe consequences, and rigorous structure, I fail to maintain any length of sobriety. I've managed to go a month or two, but ultimately fail. The urge to change my mood is too great. I am severely anxious and depressed. I've tried many SSRIs, off-label use of Gabapentin, and mood stabilizers, all of which have provided limited aid in preventing anxiety and depression. I have tried individual therapy, group therapy, IOP, in-patient, and involving myself in the recovering community. I've done all of these things together, while also taking the recommended medicine and struggled even more so with anxiety and depression than when I was getting high.  My greatest success in life has come while getting high (mainly academic -- high college GPA, admission into a prestigious university, etc.). Drugs have also exacerbated my greatest failures (arrests, tens of thousands of dollars wasted, severe laziness, selfishness, narcissism, continued immaturity, removal of emotions, etc.). 

I understand that Suboxone maintenance does not come without  severe side-effects. I also understand that it may only be a superficial and flawed way of improving his or her quality of life and that a strong argument can be made against all maintenance programs. I will proceed to weigh the benefits and risks of entering into the program. I would greatly appreciate any critiques of my cost / benefit analysis.

**Underlying issues I wish to address**

- Severe diagnosed major depressive disorder
- Diagnosed general anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder 
- Undiagnosed borderline personality disorder (I fit the model incredibly well)

**My plan**

I realize that Suboxone on its own is not the appropriate way of seeking long-term sobriety, nor is it very effective. I realize I need to attack my addiction by using a comprehensive approach, which incorporates Subxone, but is not my only defense against a relapse. 

My plan will be multifaceted:

- Take Suboxone as prescribed for 1-5 years, perhaps longer
- Weekly attendance of AA and serious participation in the program: sponsor, service commitments, working the steps, calling supports, etc.
- Continued visits with a psychiatrist who provides medication (taking an SSRI and off-label Gabapentin for anxiety): take medications as prescribed.
- Exercise: structured running, lifting and basketball
- Individual therapy with a psychologist I am incredibly open with on a weekly or bi-weekly basis: honesty, willingness to listen and take advice.
- Group therapy, such as IOP, followed by CBT and DBT training: honest participation and real effort. 
- Honesty with those I am close with: I have struggled severely with honesty, as I am incredibly paranoid and afraid that people will use the truth against me to try and attack me. This will be very difficult.

*Think about others much more frequently*

- Volunteering: do it with another person to keep me accountable 
- Provide my GF with a day of the week dedicated to her

*The rest of the plan*

- SUGGESTIONS ARE NEEDED
- Rigorous schedule and structure: Clean house, commitments to myself and others
- Personal care: good hygiene, making and keeping medical appointments, taking care of my health, organized routines, etc.
- Goals, lists, ambitions: keep track of progress, make goals, etc.
- Gratitude: believing in something greater than myself, taking stock of how fortunate I am
- Mindfulness / meditation: learn and practice these activities on daily basis
- Continuation of strong college work ethic: take school incredibly seriously, really dig into it before graduation
- Work: take part-time job seriously and ask for many hours
- Develop a hobby: I currently have none

*BUSY, BUSY, BUSY*

Much of my plan is overly ambitious, but I see it as being necessary to take many of the steps I listed in order to maintain sobriety and have a strong sense of well-being, high quality of living.


**Benefits of Suboxone alongside the improvements I've disccued above**

**- Anti-depressant** for my treatment resistant depression: several studies indicate that buprenorphine can serve as an anti-depressant in treating severe depression.

""Low-dose buprenorphine may be a novel-mechanism medication that provides a rapid and sustained improvement for older adults with TRD""

Karp J, Butters M, Reynolds C, et al. Safety, tolerability, and clinical effect of low-dose buprenorphine for treatment-resistant depression in midlife and older adults. Journal Of Clinical Psychiatry [serial online]. August 2014;75(8):e785-e793. Ipswich, MA. 

""We propose that the combination of buprenorphine with naltrexone represents a novel, and potentially a readily translatable approach, to the treatment of depression""

Almatroudi A, Husbands S, Bailey C, Bailey S. Combined administration of buprenorphine and naltrexone produces antidepressant-like effects in mice. Journal Of Psychopharmacology [serial online]. July 2015;29(7):812-821. Ipswich, MA. 

Several other studies can be found on the NIH database that have provided evidence that bupe can successfully treat depression.

**- BPD Treatment?**

Also of interest is the finding that a prevalence of borderline-personality disorder exists among those seeking bupe treatment.

""Among individuals who are addicted to opioids and seeking treatment with buprenorphine, the prevalence of BPD, as mutually confirmed by three self-report measures, is quite high.""

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18724572

**- Anti-anxiety** effects for my severe anxiety.

The center for Study and Control of Alcoholism conducted a study in which anxiety and depression in opiate addicts were treated with Methadone and Suboxone successfully.

**- Stability**

This is huge for me. My life is completely chaotic. I am constantly fretting over getting high. I am OD'ing, blowing all my money on boy, upsetting my GF, and my family. It's an absurd way to live. This may be the biggest reason I want to pursue this path; I want to be able to be satisfied to a point I will not seek out drugs and potentially OD. I don't want my days consumed with cravings. Only Suboxone has provided me this. I speak only from personal experience, but it has successfully removed cravings when I have taken it.

**Draw-backs from entering into maintenance therapy**
  
**- How will I kick Suboxone?**

This is incredibly concerning. Estimates of relapse after discontinuing long-term Suboxone use are over 90%. The withdrawals are said to be more agonizing than heroin withdrawal. They say once you are on it for a long period of time, you will never be able to kick it. This is fucking scary, but I justify perhaps indefinite Suboxone use by comparing it with indefinite use of heroin. Those seem to be my two options.

**- Blocking of emotions**

It is said that you feel even less than you do while on dope. This would indicate that healing isn't occurring in your brain because your opiate receptors are constantly engaged. This also scares me. My brain chemistry will be completely altered it seems.

**- Thyroid disfunction, hair loss, and tooth loss**

This is what I find most problematic. There isn't much research into the long-term physical effects of Subxone, but many people report these issues.

At the end of the day it comes down to this question...
*I have a desire to escape the rat-race of addiction, but fear the slavery of  taking that orange strip until the day I die.* I want out of this fucking mess. I want to just be normal. Any advice or comments would be incredibly helpful

I am a college student, and from what I see, most kids have dabbled in prescription pills. With that being said, the amount of people who actually get addicted does not correlate with the amount of people who have tried it. Is it likely that only a few people do end up being addicted? That the chance for addiction is exaggerated? Can most people recreationally use pills without a fear of addiction?

I'm also aware that the best way to lower tolerance is to stop using completely. Recently I've been up to 6 or 7 bags a day and I need to bring it down as much as possible. I've taken a few days off with some Subs and Kratom, and had some uncomfortable withdrawal and a ton of sweating, which has helped my tolerance a lot. First dose back was today and half a stamp has me happy. But, I'm curious as to what some other options might be. 

When trying to taper for tolerance, let's say with H, do you find it better to do smaller amounts more often a day(3-5) or a slightly larger amount less often a day (1-2)?

My goal in general is to wait as long as possible between each use, not until I want to get high again, but until I start to feel ill. ideally 1-2 doses per day, hoping just one dose and maybe even down to a few doses every other day. I've been taking DXM 30mg before doses and am looking into other supplements that may help keep it low. Also does anyone here use Kratom/Bupe to help lower/maintain tolerance.

I looked inside and got excited because I recognized one of them as a t3. But as I was googling the pills I realized it was way better than that, as well as the one t3 there was 2 30mg morphine pills, about 6 extended release 5mg morphines and a few instant release 5s as well. That night at work (dummy alert) I took a 30mg morphine and because I have no tolerance I got reaaaally fuckin high, and had to drink red bull to stay awake. I only took a few of the pills home so they wouldn't notice but one of them I took home was a green pill that said 80 on one side and CDn on the other. I googled it and they are ""fake"" oxy pills, which actually contain fentanyl. I live in Canada BTW and I think that's the only place that has them. So long story short I probably should have posted this 30 mins ago but I snorted about 1/4 of the pill and Im pretty high, not as high as the morphine though. I'm just wondering how much someone with basically no tolerance, (or do I have a tolerance after doing some?), can snort safely, and how long should I wait before doing more? Maybe later tonight snort another 1/4? Idk any help is welcome, idk why I typed that much.

LSD is my real vice. 

The real problem that I'm facing is that while I know plenty of heroin users, other drug dealers, and overall a wide array of people who I know COULD hook it up but are all refusing because of the drugs addictive nature. It somewhat annoys me that people can't just respect that I want to experiment when they know full well that I have a firm grasp over my addictive personality.

Honestly, I didn't even really enjoy oxy/morphine/Vicodin as much as other people seem to. I felt good, great even, but nowhere close to the mindshattering glory that rampages through my soul and flesh on psychedelics. I'm just rambling at this point.

The 'chef' of my usual dealer called me and said that he fired my dealer and isn't working with him anymore. That's good because he was kind of annoying from time to time, an addict himself and also drank a lot what made him really aggressive sometimes.... The chef told that I can come to him from now on when I need something and this is really a blessing since he's living just a 5minute walk away from me!!!! 
The first thing to do is to test how far you can go with a new dboy + showing him that I'm trustworthy so I asked if he could give me one for a few hours until the evening during the time I'm at work and he said yes sure without any discussion or anything. So I walked to him, got a ball of H, went back home, shot it up (man this was so good after 2 days of just filter cooking!!!!!!!) and went to work. After work I called him to meet and he asked me if i can get him some cigs on the way, what obviously wasn't a problem. I earned 30€ but had also nothing to eat at home and have still 2 days to go so I bought with the cigs food for 2€(toast,milk,farina&pudding) and went to him to ask what he can give me for the money I have left (22+the cigs for 6€). So he said he'll give me 3 balls and will just count the one from earlier as a welcome present!!!! 
So I'm now here having my dope and food and everything just went better than expected! Gonna cook it up and watch a documentary now.

More than 28,000 Americans accidentally overdosed on opioids in 2014, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. About half of those were prescription painkiller overdoses, officials said at the summit.


“When you look at the staggering statistics in terms of lives lost, productivity impacted, cost to communities, costs to families, it has to be something that has to be right up there at the top of our radar screen,” Obama told a town hall meeting at the National Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit.

More people now die of narcotic drug overdoses than die in car accidents each year, Obama said.

Roughly 8 million Americans over the age of 12 need treatment for illicit drug use, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

Meanwhile, 4 out of 5 addicts, 80%, can’t get treatment, even if they want it. That’s because there aren’t enough doctors who know how to treat substance abuse. The treatment programs that do exist have long waiting lists, according to speakers at the summit.

Along with the president’s appearance Tuesday, the White House announced a package of initiatives aimed at turning the tide on opioid addiction in the U.S.


Those included a new proposed rule from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that would raise the cap on the number of patients doctors can treat with buprenorphine, a controlled substance that helps wean addicts off the more potent drugs they’re abusing. That will allow more people to get this medication, which has been shown to help people recover from addiction.

There’s also more money -- $94 million -- coming for community health centers, and $11 million in new grants for communities that want to expand medication-assisted treatment programs.

That’s just a drop in the bucket compared to the $1.1 billion Obama has proposed “to help every American with an opioid-use disorder who wants treatment get the help they need,” according to a White House press release. Congress still has to approve that money.

Leana Wen, MD, Baltimore’s commissioner of health, drew cheers from the crowd of 2,000 people gathered to hear Obama speak.

She recounted a personal experience with a patient she'd gotten to know when she was working in a hospital ER. The woman, she said, was a competitive swimmer in her twenties. She’d started taking opioid pain medications to treat a back injury, became addicted to them, and switched to heroin. She came to the ER about once a week, Wen said.

“It’s one of the worst realizations for a doctor, it’s one of the most humbling things, is to know that you can’t help them,” Wen said.

The doctors would resuscitate the woman, and she would ask for treatment for her addiction. But they couldn’t get her into a treatment program. Her patient, she said, eventually overdosed and died.

“We would never say to someone who’s had a heart attack, ‘Go home. If you’re still alive in 3 months, come back, and we’ll get you treatment,’” she said, to enthusiastic applause. “We’re treating addiction different than any other disease.”

Wen issued a standing order in Baltimore so that anyone who takes a short amount of training can get a prescription for naloxone, or Narcan, a drug that can reverse an overdose.

Tl;dr White House seeks tougher limits on sub 

“That’s what a solution looks like,” said the town hall moderator, CNN's Sanjay Gupta, MD.

A culture of overprescribing and overmedicating is at the heart of the opioid epidemic, both Obama and Wen said.

“We live in a society where we medicate a lot of problems and where we self-medicate a lot of problems,” the president said.

Gupta told the audience that Americans take 80% of the world’s pain medications. “We don’t have 80% of the world’s pain, I think,” he said.

Wen said she knows doctors aren’t trying to harm their patients when they prescribe pain medications.

“I know that doctors are trying to do the right thing. We’re not trying to get our patients addicted to medications,” she said.

But she said doctors are writing 30-day prescriptions for pain that may last a few days.

“This is the culture of excess that has to change,” she said.

So I started recreational use of opiates at 17. At first it was just occasional pill popping. At 18 I had a girlfriend who I lived with. She had been using for years, her mother and grandmother had chronic pain and multiple scripts. Between both of them we had a decent and steady supply. The first time I went into withdrawal it hit me randomly at a restaurant and I ran outside to puke. Restless legs, shivers, general depression and discomfort. I didn't know what it was at first. I figured it out pretty quickly. She introduced me to heroin, and you know how the progression goes. Few months after my tolerance rose, so I decided to learn how to shoot up. The high was more intense but so was the withdrawal. Now I would wake up sick and shot up almost every day. Usually multiple times. I was 19.

Broke up, went to rehab, moved to a new city, spent serious time away from any opiates. Around half a year. For the year after I did H maybe a dozen times. Hadn't been sick since the daily use phase. 

Now I am 22. In the past year I started using more frequently, weekend type use. As we are prone to do, I have noticed myself using more often though. A pattern roughly consists of 2 days of use, 3 days off in the past 4 months. Only shooting. I still haven't gotten any noticeable withdrawal symptoms. Sure, when I'm not on it I wish I was, but that's it. I just remember how much I hated getting sick so I wait a few days. 

Is this sustainable? Is it possible to successfully chip after having previously had a physical addiction? Everybody has a different experience, what is yours?

&nbsp;

Where does it land? I'll give you one guess...

&nbsp;

Right between my breasts. Being the DDs that they are, fucking thing gets stuck there for what felt like an hour (yeah, I know, probably just a couple of seconds at most). But, fucking OUCH, man. Fuck. 

&nbsp;

Hands down, second worst nod burn I've ever had. The worst one I've given myself.

Number 1 of all time was when my ex nodded while I was asleep--i wasn't even high...dropped his Newport on the blankets I was wrapped in...goddam blanket melted to my arm. I woke up screaming in pain. That was fun. I have a scar the size of a quarter about two inches below my elbow, on the top of my arm. The arm hair doesn't grow in that spot and it's a weird silvery, shiney color with an almost lacy texture. I hate when people ask how I got it. Because of the blankets melting onto my skin resulting in the size and texture, not to mention the location, it doesn't resemble a typical cigarette burn in the slightest.

4coxng,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4coxng/what_i_call_allergy_veins/,3,https://redd.it/4coxng,Laced_Decal,"What I call ""allergy veins""","So I've been wanting to come ask this question to a community of other users for a while. 

A strange thing has been happening occasionally when I inject in my legs.  It doesn't happen every time, but when it does, it feels like I'm hitting an artery sorta with the hot sting pain rolling away from the injection site down the rest of my leg.

Let me be clear though--I know what hitting an artery is, and this isn't it.  First of all, the veins are all shallow.  Second, it's not as painful--if I go real slow I can usually get the shot in, what I'm saying is the pain is similar to the artery pain.  Third, the blood isn't super bright red, and doesn't pulsate in.

No, this is something different.  For shorthand between my gf and I, I call them allergy veins.  But what's weird is certain veins will be just fine, and then randomly on the 3rd, 5th, 13th (I'm rarely that lucky but it's happened), a good vein will suddenly become an allergy vein.

When that happens, it's almost like the vein burst inside, because I've noticed when it happens, I can suddenly move the point around much more without losing the register.  

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I live in LA so it's black tar.  I've been using for like 8 years, and until 2 years ago this never happened. It may be in my head, but it feels like it's been happening on a lesser intermittent basis lately too.  ",1459407397.0

(it was hard on him having to deal with everything left behind by his wife so it was easier that I/others got rid of her things.)

I've dabbled with opiates only with hydrocodone/tranadol/codeine.
A lot of people says to just rid of the patch for its not worth the trouble. I wanted to give it a try because curiosity got ahold of me. It is transdermal 25/mcg. I have cut it 1/9th in 1/2. Which is 1/18 of the whole patch. 1.3mcg according to my calculator. I just put it on my right shoulder as of 10 minutes ago. Will update how I feel.

I went home and packed a bowl complete with cigarette ash on the bottom, and sprinkled the DMT on top. It was this really odd crystalline shape.

I put the lighter to the bowl and torched the shit out of it. After 30 seconds my vision went black and I started to see some geometric shapes. They went back and forth, creating amazing visuals.

But I got an odd feeling, I felt as if I was in an art gallery, with my life painted on ancient canvas, I did not see any of the art, but I felt it.

It made me feel good. I felt at peace, I felt okay.

It seemed like a door opened, as I went through the geometric patterns persisted, but I felt voices calling to me. Saying ""It will be  okay"" in a language I have never heard, but I understood it none the less.

As I returned to my body, after what felt like many days, I noticed that only 30ish minutes have passed. But I felt amazing, clear headed, and okay.

I don't think shes comfortable going any higher though, and nothing has really changed for me. The pain is still intense, and these generic pills have almost zero effect. Is this a problem with me? Is there a history of generics not working properly? Is the pharmacy ripping me off and giving me fakes? What is going on here? Is there any way insurance can be forced to pay for name brand drugs if generic pills do nothing? Anyway, these are just some of the questions/problems I'm going through right now.

Judge my supply list,"I'm tired of trying over and over and failing, so I went so far as to delete my entire mobile phone account for a new (cheaper! Yay!) one so I can't go into the online history of to see what numbers I've been calling regularly for dope and my dboy doesn't have my new number (in fact no one does outside family and sober friends). I just took my final hit of some super high-grade shit, so it should keep me going until about 2-3 tomorrow afternoon. I am not unprepared though. I've been planning for this moment so I'd have all four prescriptions to help me all at the same time.    
I have 30ct 1mg klonopins; 20ct 30mg temazepams; 20ct 5mg cyclobenzaprine, and an old, but not expired bottle of motion sickness pills, and a bottle of DPH. On top of that I have 2 8mg suboxone sublingual strips and a pretty steady supply of weed.
I'm looking to make this as painless as possible. I know it's a bitch no matter what but I think I've got enough of the right supplies that I don't have to be in **absolutely unbearable** pain and anxiety.    
    
I also have bananas, peanut butter, and multi-vitamins. And of course a faucet to get water from. I've heard from a lot of people who've kicked that's a key most people neglect: drinking a shitload of water. It's good for you anyway, but when your body is trying to spaz out it's even better for you.    
    
I'm really fucking serious about it this time. I cannot keep going on like this and for the first time in a long time I can see myself living past 30 and I don't want to fuck that prophecy up by being weak at this critical stage in my recovery. If anyone has any suggestions, I am quite open to hearing them. I know I have to stay away from the rat bastards I once called ""friends"" and be rid of my dealer's number, which has been deleted from my phone, and my account history.    
    
So if there's anything I've missed do please let me know so I can see what I can do about plugging any holes in my plan. I'm getting everything important to do with my job (I work out of the house) out of the way so I'm not just putting it off because life sucks at that moment.    
    
I *am* going to make it this time. I refuse any other option. So, yeah, any tips would be fantastical, and I'll probably do a log every few hours and post it at the end of the day so I can track my progress. If anyone feels like helping, please do! If you don't feel like helping, just move on.    
    
Look forward to hearing any advice anyone has. Thank you all in advance for being here for me. Luckily I have some days off and a Netflix subscription so I'll be sorted while I have to stay in bed hating life. :)    
    
Let the games begin!

And if you're in the same boat: Good luck to you. I really mean it. This is going to be the hardest thing I've ever done in my life and I'm not taking it lightly.

Also a question about delayed high/rush when shooting.,"I mean like sometimes it's up to a minute - maybe 3 minutes until the full high envelopes me. 



I just started doing dope again after nearly two years of not. 


Kinda wondering if I'm alone in this or if my circulatory system is fucked or something.



But now for the junky story.



So I got impatient today and picked up through this guy I know. We stop to get rigs and he comes out chugging a Red Bull. I think that's funny but whatever. Then before even getting into the car he starts breaking the can down and I'm like ""ohhhh fuck no."" 



He's dead set on shooting before he got back to work and my pleading to not do so in my car, much less while driving apparently fell on deaf ears. 


Call me a pussy or whatever, I'm in WDs, stressed the fuck out about a million other things already, just trying to get him back to work so I can beat traffic, get home, and get high. He also just hooked me up with his dude. So I relent...


I tell him I have no water in the car. He points to a glass with less than an inch of old backwashy, dusty, with some tiny bits of cigarette ash water in it. I tell him this is from over 3 days ago, consolidated from multiple cups that I had nearly finished, dirty, and was not fucking safe at all. He doesn't care.



So he pours WAY more than the ""half bag"" he claimed he would need into the bottom of this red bull can. Puts some dirty trash water in there, and FUCKING HEATS IT. This motherfucker starts COOKING ECP IN MY CAR. I was just too dumbfounded to even say anything. Never thought I'd see the day.


We're moving at this point, so not many chances to be seen. But I notice some dirty looks from other drivers and want to just disappear.

Wants to use the seatbelt to tie off but fuck that I can't have an EXTRA risk on top of somebody already not listening to me at all. So I let him try my phone charger. 





He starts trying to tie off in the middle of the nice financial/business district of my city. We're stopping at multiple intersections now. With traffic on all sides, people on sidewalks, workers unloading trucks, people just fucking staring and him not being able to get it around his arm. So he uses my auxiliary cable. He's flicking his arm, not even trying to hide anything. Waving the syringe around, all kinds of shit.



I'm beginning to think I should've just let him use the seatbelt... 



Anyway, he finally just bites of a cigarette filter, puts it in the shitty fucking mixture, and stabs the syringe straight down into it. No technique... Then, does essentially the same thing with his arm. Never seen somebody just go straight down into their arm before. He's struggling, bleeding a fair amount, and wearing short sleeves on his way back to work. Again, we're stopping and starting at lights all through this ordeal. I'm terrified of getting fucked by cops, but have resigned myself to fate at this point.



I'm amazed. He somehow registers and bangs half of it home to save the rest. Tucks it into his sock and inspects his arm. 



""I really do appreciate the caution man. Most people just don't care about anything but copping. But I mean I do other shit than this, ya know? I have a life and shit. But anyway, sorry. I can just do it really quick and have been shooting in moving cars for a while now.""



I don't really know what to say to this. I drop him off, we thank each other, and I make it home. My bag is small, the dope ain't that great, and I swear I taste/smell red bull after my shot.

It's a lonely existence. My entire life revolves around something that I can't talk to anyone about. It hurts so fucking much to hear one of the few people who knew about your prior use congratulating you on staying clean when you were high as fuck the previous night, when you know you're copping as soon as you leave.

It's shit being 'ill' all the time. It's shit being around people who make jokes about 'junkies' and smackheads. Mocking the lifestyle they don't even know you're living.

I know it's not any easier being an open user, but there's some serious isolation going on in my life. I've never felt so lonely around people who care for me.

The initial buzz and rush of energy when oxy kicks in is unparalleled for me. Hydrocodone is alright but it lacks a certain magic. Interested in how oxymorphone and heroin compare, along with ER oxy vs IR oxy in terms of rush, euphoria, and sedation.",1459366154.0

Found a spent needle outside on the property grounds. No know diabetics on the property (plus they tend to be respectful in regards to throwing their used hypos away.) Upon observation, the syringe seemed to have some black residue in the chamber and some blood within the plastic tip.  

Now, I'd be lying to say I didn't have my suspicions nor motives against some people here but I'd like to have some sort of evidence prior to going to the house manager. 

If you are going to call me a rat, all I can say is that ""there is no honor among thieves.""

It's beautiful, and fenced in, and about half of the flowers had bloomed and half were still in pods 

That ratio leads me to believe that they truly were for decoration/beauty, as anyone who would let that many bloom past usable pods would be a fool lmao

Anyway; does anyone know if he was into poppies? This documentary is fascinating in a terrifying way; the truths about some of this stuff is crazy! But L. Ron was definitely more secretive than anyone and it would not surprise me if some sort of substance use issue could be part of the reason for him searching so hard his whole life for his own ""cure"" to the human condition?

I know this is random and dumb, and probably a waste of most of yalls time. But, that dude was weeeeeeird and who knows what he coulda been into. Also, the documentary is awesome in its own right to get stoned and watch ",1459363282.0
