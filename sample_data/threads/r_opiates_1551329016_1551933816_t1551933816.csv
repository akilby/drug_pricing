Not for the squeamish a long orange spike 25gx1'  0.5mmx35mm  being used with 2ml barrel  JJ find !! NSFW https://imgur.com/a/qhAqS8B  though s bit graphic I feel it's apart of harm reduction as if your having to go into your groin then you may need to start thinking of another way of taking your drugs or getting on a methadone script or subutex etc like I've done . As although if done properly/sterile injecting in your groin it's slightly more Risker than injecting any where else complications can include Deep vein thrombosis, blood clots , lung problems , infection , possible leg loss , operation to fix the vein if badly damaged after years of use . Main danger is hitting the artery and splitting the artery wall and bleeding to death internally as a thicker & longer needle is used as scar tissue builds up . Though if your just starting a 1ml should be used and will cause less damage if you accidently pierce the artery . You will experience extream pain if s single unit is pushed into you . Also do not inject cocaine/crack until you are confident you can hit the vein every time !! As the crack may numb the injection site and you inject the entire contents into the artery ! 

TLDR: Me rambling(high as fuck)  on about finding a bag earlier that I lost a few days ago full of valium and didn't know I had lost it . Plus me getting prescribed methadone on the 20th 

  So I scored this morning from a new guy that's basically just at the top of my street . Pretty convenient but the stuff was pretty average . I only do a bag a day and try to stick to this and manage it for the most part .

 I had my dinner but don't eat most of it as I felt a little rough but not full blown WD . So I phoned this guy but he wasn't in bit said he'd be only 20 minutes . So I waited a bit and continued watching The Umbrella Academy I quite enjoy it and my fav character just happens to be the junkie that uses drugs to numb/block out his abilities which is seeing dead people and just saw two seconds ago he can give the ghosts the ability to interact with the living world . 

Anyway I'm going off track about 40 minutes later I go to his place  and his friend is there that I've never met . This guy tells me he has just picked up some new stuff . So he makes me up my bag and the other guys and puts s bit in the foil for us all to try . Me and his mate basically smoke it all and I have to run it for him or my dealer as he's only been taking it for 3 weeks ! Makes me kinda feel bad helping him take it as I've been in this road and been down ALL it's dark roads . I try and tell him to get off this ride while he still can !! Turns out it's his girl friend who got him to try it as apparently they where arguing to much when they where smoking cannabis so some how thought taking heroin would help!!! PMSL they don't have any idea the Pandora's box they are currently opening !!

I Tell him about the insane amount of times I've been in jail (27) which includes alot of remands which they would crazily let me out after 3 weeks remand at one point I was out on 11 bails !!! When I finally did get the jail for TWAC Taking With Out Consent (mother car) the judge ask my lawyer . "" I'm not trying to say Mr ****** is a criminal master mind but how the hell! Is this man still at liberty !! "" To which the court room burst out laughing ! and I got remanded in the end up they completely fucked up my case as I had 12 seperate summery charges which each could have got me 12 months 8 months for pleading early . 

The ""problem"" was thete was just so much paper work the judge couldn't deal with it and he gave me 140 days !!!! PMSL and a 5 year driving ban ! Which I thought was a little excessive !! But I was basically doing cart wheels back down the stairs to the holding cells . My lawyer came straight down to the cells just as ecstatic and told me as long as I managed to get on the bus to the jail which wasn't my local jail but HMP  Barlinnie which is a violent Victorian shit hole but I didn't care !! Plus my co-pilot (cell mate) was fully committed which is a 140 day remand for serious crimes he chased two police officers around with a hand gun didn't tire it or anything but he said they absolutely shit themselves !! And tried to hide under the patrol car ! Lol He got a visit practically everyday from his cousin or GF and they brought up 1/3 bags every time ! A day didn't go by that full sentance we weren't high !! Plus when I got convicted they didn't move me which they should have as your not allowed remand and sentanced in the same cell but because of my short sentance they didn't bother üòÅ 

Anyway at court  I was one of the last ones up so in about 30/40 minutes I was on the bus ! (Thank fuck !!!!)  As happy as Larry !! Plus they back dated the sentance so my remand counted as time served as well !! Hahaha ! 

 Damn I'm high as fuck !! And writting a bloody novel !! I get back to mine and do the bag and this stuff is a bit better and feel great . So I get a treat for the dog and she's a tiny little Lapso Apso only 5 months old and she was the runt and had to be bottle feed si she small even for her breed . So I had chopped up the treat and went up stairs to give her it and dropped a couple of bits besides the bed as I picked it up I noticed a cigarette paper wrapped up in cling film and knee right away it was a bag of heroin !! üòé Last week I got mad with valium and yes I know that it's very dangerous to mix both drugs !! I thought I'd be ok only taking two !! That I got from a friend and didn't get my own batch as if I did that I'd normally get ma with it and end up eating the lot which is normally 16 tablets for a tenner . So I went home which I can remember with two bags I put one away and did the other one . Shortly after I have zero memory woke up the next morning and my mum told me I was absolutely out my nut and filmed me which she showed me . My mum keeps my money so I can budget better and not spend it all at once . I wanted ¬£10 to go into town and get another bag which I didn't really understand until tonight but mystery solved!! Wish I had found it an hour before I got another bag but hey what ever. It's been s good night ! Plus I'm quite enjoying The Umbrella Academy . 

  Oh I almost forgot I had my referral today at my local Health centre/GP which was pretty handy and didn't have to travel to the local hospital /mental health facility which would have been a pain to get to as I'd need to get two buses and would most likely cost over ten pounds to get there and back so they came to me and was only a  5 minute walk . There was two of them one I think was in training as she was quite young and a woman in her early 30s . Since I've been on methadone before they didn't really need to explain much and they where still giving out the same booklets they where 10 plus years ago . I just went over my drug history when I started what drugs I was currently taking and what I wanted out the program which is basically stability and to get some money behind me and get my house decorated and get cooking facilities that I don't have at the moment . As just now every penny goes on heroin . So I have no disposable income . Plus the council is unwilling to help . A few weeks ago I got notified ""someone"" my old bat of a neighbour who I fucking cut her grass for her !! Lifted the phone and told the council I wasn't living in the house . I really don't get why someone would try and grass someone in off their own back !! But it kinda back fired as I was upfront and told the guy who came out to the house the truth that I wasn't staying there full time as I had no cooking facilities and not even a fridge or microwave at the time (got both now) and he understood and referred to to a couple of organisations that are going to help me . Though I just got word I got rejected by the council again . But I'm going to appeal it . 

   When I applied for a council house I had no idea that I'd get offered a house if 4 WEEKS !!!  First place they offered might have well been in Syria !! First it was 30 miles from where I grew up or know any one !! Plus the flats looked like they had been built by communist Russians !! Lol a horrible concrete grey area of the town and a 5 minute Google search of it told me to avoid it like the plage .

About  2 weeks later I got another offer in my town in a really rough area filled with drug dealers ,muggings ,assaults and a few stabbings and slashings . Plus it was a poxy bedsit basically what you guys call a studio flat I think a largish one room property living room and kitchen combined with a broom closet for a bedroom . I even knew the guy that last stayed in it and had been in it a few times so that was a no !! .

 Next place was only a mile and a half away from me in the next village over a nice little bungalow üòÅ it was just about perfect in a good quiet area though even further from town . But the bungalow was just recently out fitted for a disabled person !! Like all brand new stuff almost all the banisters, a slight run way into the front door, a new wet room etc . Why the hell they where offering it to me I had no idea as apart from addiction I'm perfectly healthy and able bodied . So out of respect I turned it down and this time went in to their offices myself and asked them what they where playing at !!?? The woman looked/treated me like I was crazy at first and couldn't understand why I was turning down a good property but soon realised my objections and I made them promise/try to give it to someone that actually reality needed it !! My friend lives just a hundred or so meters  away and has told me someone in s wheel chair moved in . I also didn't want to move there as there's a bit of bad blood as my brother killed someone in that village by total accident (crash) and his wife just won't let it go !! Plus he got screwed over at court/police he shouldn't have even been charged as it was a complete accident . My Auntie works for the Met down in England and she has reduced duties due to her back and it's basically her job to decide if there's enough evidence or its in the public's interest to charge someone and she said if it came across her desk he wouldn't have been charged with what he was charged with . The police didn't even interview him FFS !!! Months later he just got a letter through the door he was being charged and would need to get a lawyer and go to court . 

The guy that got killed had a son in the local police and I think some of the family had some well to do folk in local government as well . So he was rail roaded they tried to say he was a bit racer etc even though he was going the speed limit and made a simple over taking mistake . Plus he had the car two days and it was proven the back end was faulty and it wasn't properly checked they are ment to do like a 100 odd point check but this wasn't done . Plus on the guys small van you could turn off the driver airbags for some insane reason and he did this for some reason !! And it was the steering column that killed him by crushing his chest. 

All this and other things where completely ignored plus the cop son some how managed to sneak into court even though he knew he wasn't allowed into court . I wasn't allowed to go as I can some times have a mouth on me and I'm no stranger to courts and have no problem speaking my mind I've had to defend myself a couple of times when my lawyer or underling  has failed to turn up . I've told the judge to go fuck themselves etc a couple if times . One judge I knew have me  two weeks in  prison just to be a cunt as he knew me and this was at the district court where NO ONE GETE THE JAIL ! Or very rarely !  So I started giving him abuse so I was in contempt of court . Plus I used to work for the fucking stuck up cunt !! As he owned a restaurant which was very posh and expensive though the food was 5 üåü and I learned alot ! As everything was made from scratch ! And there was a shit tonne of prep work . I was at college training to be a chef at the time (16 years old)  so I was basically the KP kitchen porter/bus boy and every other kitchen position when needed valuable training yes but of course this was abused !! But me being me I didn't put up with that shit ! Kinda got on trouble but the head chef understood where I was coming from and they treated me a bit different from my friend who got me the job there and was also in my class . He was a really mellow dude and constantly smoke hash !! He had a joint in his mouth when ever he could !! . 

  When you worked there you got absolutely nothing to eat !! And got in serious trouble if you did ! Plus that arsehole would come in every so often and try and lord it up all over us . Normally banging on about his stupid rules etc Never worked in a kitchen like it ! Food and the odd coca cola or even a sneeky beer or alchopop which is easier to hide are normally a perk of the job as long as your not taking the piss and making yourself fillet steak every day once a week maybe !! Lol In other places if the bar staff etc  ordered something I'd go out my way to give them extra as they where still paying a bit of money to it . I'd make awesome huge burgers or if they orders a cheap steak I'd give them s better one or make them a huge mixed grill etc . They in return would do you drinks when you wanted them and not the concentrated orange juice or blackcurrant you were supposed to get . Though a Smirnoff ice and blackcurrant was one of my favs !! The amount of alchoholic chefs is quite surprising !! And drinking at work was very common or drug taking . 

  End up my brother got 6 fucking years !!! Bit he appealed it and he got 4 years but they kept it over 3yrs 8 months so he wouldn't get half remission and become licence when he got out . He got to an open prison pretty fast though and did 3 weeks in one week out . But the idiot got caught with a soda can pie and tiny bit if legal high and got sent back to normal  jail but managed to get back to an open after a few months of keeping his nose clean . 

   My bro is really into his football and likes to go to the Rangers home matches when they are on . There's a club bus that departs from that village and is organised from there and that fucking cow found out and got him fucking batted from the bus !!! She wrote a letter to the chairman and they got another couple of anon letters about him and they asked him not to come back !! THIS REALLY PISSED ME OFF !! If it where up to me I would have done something in retaliation yes it's petty and most likely criminal but I would have felt better about it . But I need to respect my bros wishes so I didn't do anything. Also not that money matters and certainly can't bring back a lived one  but the guy was also insured up to the max and she got ALOT of money from the accident and I mean serious üí∞üí∞üí∞ she also places flowers at the crash site constantly !! And it's been nearly 10 years !! Fresh ones are there all year round and we travel this road most days . I know it sounds really bad but come to fuck !! How long are you going to greave for until you start moving on !! If anything it's just not healthy !! The fields where it happened are up for sale so I think she has been told to stop putting them there as it'll obviously affect potential customers . The small streach of road is an accident black spot and people crash there ALL THE TIME . When my bro crashed about a week and a half later they resurfaced the road and put down road markings not to over take . Something that wasn't there when my bro crashed but they said was there when he did crash that was a complete lie !! You could have easily have used Google maps to disprove this deception but I'm not even sure his lawyers did . Like I said the whole court case was a sham !! When he got found guilty/sentenced the wife had an out hurts of ""We did it"" that when I heard if this I found highly suspicious !!! DID WHAT ?? They should have had no hand in court proceedings !! 

  Anyway that's all in the past and my bro has moved on well apart from the recent football bus petty shit !! I'm just looking forward to the 20th and I can get my script !! Apparently I'll get it that day and they now set up the chemist for you as back in the day you had to find one yourself and had to go from chemist to chemist with the actual script and try and get into one relatively close to where you lived . I just have to repeat what I said to the nurses and give a piss test probably to prove you have opiates in your system had have some what of a tolerance and your not going to get 30 ml and OD an hour or so later ! You used to have to go to the hospital in withdrawal and they would give you 10ml and hour or so and see what amount stabilised you and constantly take your vitals but they don't do it that way any more thankfully we it could take hours . Now it just a quick chat tell you what's expected of you like turning up to appointments , if you want a weekly worker and apparently there are workers now that actually have experience !!! And have either been clean for years or are on a maintance program . I think this is a brilliant idea !! As being told some bullshit about addiction from some drug worker in their early 20s that's never even had a cigarette in their mouth used to annoy me to no end !!!  Like the nurse today telling me how all the heroin going about just now is crap ! I'm like how do you know that ?? Have you tried loads of different bags from local dealers ? Her:umm no obviously not . Me: Ao you've had lots of recent batches tested or got information from police raids on confiscated heroin ? Her: ehhh no. So why say something like that if you don't actually know ?? She then quickly change the subject !! 

  Hope everyone is doing well and your not in WD through lack of funds or much  worse you can't score any where !! All  best from bonnie Scotland !!

I have forgiven them and check up with them every once in a while. 

I go meet up with them every once in a while and the itching and small pupils give it away when this person has relapsed. Sometimes they tell me they're clean other times they tell me they've struggled in the past and had a relapse but never when the relapse happens. The conversations are short and I just listen and tell them that relapse is normal. This person does not go into detail about their substance use so I try to respect that. I know a lot more about their past substance use through others than they think I do but I never bring it up. 

I understand why they would not go into detail or bring it up and I dont want to pry. I dont want to judge or stigmatize this person or even tell them to stop using if they are. I just want to have a conversation about naloxone, clean needles, not using alone and make sure that they're using harm reduction services. Should I bring up this conversation with them? I dont want this person to think I'm judging them especially because theres a lot of stigma, history between us and they only briefly mention relapse after they're clean again.

He often, but not always, uses any day he can afford to, and when he does, it's multiple times per day. I even used to sell him acetyl- and butyl-fentanyl, and his purchase pattern was the familiar one we all know well.

*However*, he says that when he can't score D, he gets at the absolute most extremely mild WD symptoms, a bit of a runny nose and some yawning. And in the time that I've known him, used with him, sold to and bought from him, he has never been visibly sick.

I've tried to Google it and also run searches through academic journals, but I've not found anything about immunity to opioid withdrawals.  

Any of you experience this personally or know someone with a similar claim? He does go through alcohol withdrawals when he drinks like that, so it's just like that with opies. It is the kind of flex that someone might make up, but I really doubt it with this guy. He knows that a lie like that is a great way to not get help if you're legit sick.

I've told him that if it's true, he needs to put his body and brain into the hands of science when he dies. At the very least, it would be extremely interesting, but it could likely also pave the way for novel, highly effective treatments for recovery/detox and rewrite the book on the neurology/physiology of opioid addiction.

I'm not super into heroin anymore anyway, even though I've been doing it all day every day for over a year. Mostly because it doesn't make me feel high anymore, just normal. I've heard people that have been addicts for 5+ years have this problem along with a huge tolerance but I don't even have a tolerance like that. 15mg of oxy still puts me on my ass, but doesn't make me feel high. Just dopey. So the fact that my once favorite euphoric as hell drug ever, no longer does anything for me, is pretty depressing. Blessing in disguise? Bah. 

Anyway...

My question is, when I stop taking these other opioids, will I withdraw as bad as I would if I had stopped while taking only heroin? 

I've heard people switch to methadone to then quit more easily, same thing with Kratom. So if I'm not actually doing heroin, am I just postponing my sickness or am I really getting clean and on the right track? I'm worried I'm just replacing one addiction with another.

&#x200B;

I started using a couple years ago, I smoked H on and off for a while (an average of twice a month). When I felt distressed, up to twice a week. I never became a heavy user (well, not yet), and I have not smoked since December. I maintained a very average life, getting C's at University, working a minimum wage job etc. Most people I know, including many cokeheads (along with some ketheads and the odd crack user), alienated me once they found out. Maybe I shouldn't blame them (not sure I do) but my heroin use didn't affect anyone. The experience blew my mind, more than smoking heroin did. I study Human Geography and I have decided to undertake a dissertation that focuses on the stigmatisation of heroin. I will be looking into various outbreaks, treatment programs etc. Where I live, there is an extremely strong correlation assumed between poverty and heroin use (not in the sense that heroin makes you poor but in the sense that only the poor, in every sense of the word, will consider taking heroin). I want to investigate this narrative in depth. It would be great to hear your thoughts, but I am not necessarily looking for a specific explanation in response to a specific question. I would love to hear absolutely any experience or thoughts you have personally had, it terms of being ousted from society. My study will have a spatial element so any thoughts on how you experience certain space. Spaces you feel excluded by versus spaces, or moments, where you feel secure. This can also be discussed in terms of actually being high. Absolutely anything you can think of.

&#x200B;

I want to remind everyone: I am not trying to romanticise heroin or advocate its use. I am also not, in the slightest, trying to claim that I am immune to addiction, who knows what will happen in the future. I simply want to learn about people's experience of either, being alienated or alienating themselves. I just want to hear your feelings.

As the title says I was getting clean. After days of essentially having the flu and wanting to die I said fuck it I‚Äôll got to the movies tomorrow by myself. What I didn‚Äôt expect was I was at the really sensitive and easy to cry part of the quitting process. Idk if it‚Äôs like this for many other theatres but out the one right near me you get really comfy lounge type seats where u push a button and a guy comes to take your order. They have a lot of good meals on their menu which is great. 

Trailers start. I see the trailer for ‚Äúdogs journey‚Äù I think it was called. Cried during that. I was really quiet and there were barely any people so no one could ever tell. Towards the end of the movie I was emotional again. When it was over and I headed out to my car it was snowing beautifully. I didn‚Äôt even know it was supposed to snow. Driving back was so beautiful and coupling that with me thinking back on the movie and here come the emotions. 

The thing about that whole experience was that it actually felt amazing. As someone who has been emotionally blunted for a long time it was so foreign to me when I actually got emotional. It felt great to actually get some tears out. Tbh I wish I could play that all out again. What‚Äôs the reason for writing all this nonsense that no one cares about? This was a really nice experience that I only got when I decided to quit using opioids. If this little story helps even just one person to think about quitting then I‚Äôll have done my duty.

If so how did it start and when? How do you feel opiates have changed your high school life as opposed to the rest of the kids in your school? 

I‚Äôll start. I sold a lot of weed sophomore year. I started selling a lotta coke junior year (and doing a lot too lol). But in the middle of my junior year I started sellin dope, mostly to older people cuz nobody my age did it. But of course I started to it but I thought it was okay because I had money. I got addicted late junior year. But I feel opiates took a lot from how high school was supposed to be for me. I would miss school a lot or dismiss myself from school because I was sick. I would skip lunch and sit in the bathroom sometimes because I didn‚Äôt wanna eat or was depressed from being dopesick. I didn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúschool spirit‚Äù compared to all of my friends, and I even remember skipping big pep rallies and assemblies to leave school early without getting caught to get well. Needless to say my grades suffered and so did my attendance. I feel if I wasn‚Äôt on opiates, or at least didn‚Äôt get physically addicted to them, I would‚Äôve had a much better high school career with better memories. It affected a lot of my friendships in school too. 

In my school we would have a week of shop or vocations and then a week of academics. There was 12 of us in shop. Only 1-2 of kids in my shop knew what I was sniffing all the time in school because they were close to me. But others started to get suspicious and think it wasn‚Äôt coke that I was sniffing in shop because I‚Äôd fall asleep right after lol and I‚Äôm positive my shop teacher knew I was an addict, yet for some reason he chose me out of everyone in the shop to work for his company after we graduated. Anyway I‚Äôm rambling here. I guess what I wanna say is that being addicted to opiates took a lot of my teen and high school life from me. High school should be fun for kids. Nobody that age should be at school worrying about being dopesick. If I could go back and do it all over again, I would. But I can‚Äôt take back what I‚Äôve done and I‚Äôve gotta try to do right for right now and the future and let the past be the past. Let me know your experiences with opiates and high school below.

I‚Äôve been on suboxone for about a year now. I researched Tia and decided to give it a go. Ordered 15 grams of the sodium and did all 15g over a 5 day span.  The high was great but nothing to write home about.  Waited about 28 hours after my last sub to dose the tia. Felt great for the first 2 days but just felt like I was getting well for the remaining 3 days. I think coming off the subs affected the outcome of it. 

After those 5 days I waited 24 hours to go back on the suboxone to prevent and pwds that may occur even though tia is a TCA, it still an agonist on the Mu receptors. 

Dosed 2mg of Subs to be safe and after an hour I didn‚Äôt get any adverse effects so I continued to dose my normal 8mg. I still got no relief from withdrawals so I did another 8mg. Still nothing...
I ended up doing a total of 32mg of buprenorphine to try and saturate my receptors and it still barely touched the WDs.  Was able to sleep last night but not comfortably. 

I‚Äôm closer to 48 hours without tia now and still get hold/cold sweats and mild WDs even on suboxone.  Just stick to normal drugs if you can kiddos and take my word for it that Tianeptine ain‚Äôt worth it.

https://i.redd.it/ood46ec7wik21.jpg

Long story, short.. I began using and abusing hydrocodone off and on around 2008/2009. I‚Äôve also been around the block more than I can count with morphine sulfate, oxymorphone (OPANA, mmmm‚Ä¶), hydromorphone, fentanyl, etc. Around the time my mother became terminally with cancer in mid-2012, I began using #4 heroin (insufflated only) and A LOT of it. A best friend ‚Äúgifted‚Äù me with around $1.2M cash after she passed away (\*an entirely other story, in and of itself!\*) and things began to get out of hand. With the help of my wife, who I met while trying to self detox in the summer of July 2013 and with the help of Suboxone, I eventually got clean (other than Kratom) in late 2017. However, also in late 2017; my health problems came to a crescendo and I essentially was diagnosed with spondylosis arthritis in my neck, three extruding discs (one in my neck, other two in lower back), scoliosis of the spine, degenerative disc disease and also.. Cubital, Guyon‚Äôs and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in both hands/wrists. My PCP started treating me with steroids and tramadol. The pain was so intense and persistent, he eventually had me taking 10mg of hydrocodone, x4 day. 

&#x200B;

Eventually it was obvious my pain levels and quality of life was so unmanageable, he referred me to a pain management doctor. He‚Äôs been a WONDERFULLY attentive and empathic physician so far. He started me off with Percocet, 10mg, x4 day. The APAP was horrible on my stomach and liver, so he eventually switched me to Oxycodone, 10mg, x4 day. It helped a bit, but not quite enough to get me through a full work day on my feet. So, as of today, I‚Äôm prescribed Oxycodone, 15mg, x3 day.. however, I usually take x4 day and take the weekend off. During my last visit this past Monday, he offered to also write my a script for medical marijuana; because of the synergy between the two, many patients end up having to take less of the opiates.

&#x200B;

My wife is understandably wary, but I have a daily pill container and a chart to keep track of my usage and allow her to count the pills at the end of each day. I admittedly will usually take 1.5 orally and insufflate the other 1.5 - but it usually just depends on whether I need help with ‚Äúbreak through pain‚Äù or longer lasting relief. Sorry to ramble.. but I always see other people posting pics of their stash and after receiving my script for the month this morning, I became elated and wanted to share - it does indeed feel like my birthday! ..although it technically falls on the 19th. Cheers to all my fellow Pisces, March Birthday‚Äôers, chronic pain suffers and opiate aficionados. Good day, everyone! ",1551888704.0

This week I've been recovering from tramadol W/Ds because I feel like a cunt and would like to start doing sex something opiates have never made me keen on and if I see her again or any chick again I'd like to fuck them somewhat adequately. 

I'm 24 so this is giving me anxiety because everyone knows about it but they don't know it was my first time and they've all been fucking since like 16 (my circle of friends and there GFs friends etc) but my first go went south pretty quickly (if I hadn't of busted 2 weeks of nut in her raw I'd of gone south too return the favour but yeah nah)

I'm on day 4 of quitting tram after a month of constant (400mg) dosages daily and a few kpins have helped today but last 3 days were so sad and scary.

Anyway does anyone think if I take some Cialis this weekend (I got a decent member but my boners are like a third of what they are capable of), have a FEW drinks then pop 150mg tramadol (I heard it makes you last longer) and wear a rubber I might have a shot at redemption?

I was addicted to OxyContin and Codeine heavily as a teen (Use both at most once a month as a treat now I'm older) but only started doing tramadol this year because I got a bunch dumped on me super cheap leading to abuse for several weeks .

Anyway if anyone has any advice on how I can not cum so early (which happens usually as I'm not accustomed to sex) I'd really appreciate it. 

I lurk here a lot otherwise I'd go to r/sex but idk if they would understand me as well.

TL;DR will Tramadol 150mg max w/ Cialis and a thick rubber help me fuck adequately?

It‚Äôs all about getting sweaty‚Ä¶,"A huge topic around here is how to get through withdrawal, both acute and post acute varieties. Having gone through my own ct wd not that long ago and still being slightly sketchy, this is a subject of huge interest to me. Plus I am a bit of a science nerd so I like this stuff.

There have been a multiplicity of recommendations regarding the best way to hack your withdrawal. Supplements, comfort drugs, and so forth. But the one method to rule them all is exercise. Probably something like 90% of people here recommend it.

I am all about sweating. It has been a huge help to me and improves my shitty mood, especially in the morning. But what if there was a way to speed up your withdrawal and not even have to go out in the cold to run?

Saunas have been around for a long time. They generate intense heat, which allows you to sweat without having to run anywhere.

These days, people like to study and will study virtually anything. One studious person is Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Phd. She is a researcher, public speaker and pretty damn good looking too.

She has a bs in biochem and her doctorate is in biomedical science. So not a lightweight.

It turns out that a 20 minute sauna bath can raise endorphin levels in your brain, plus do many other amazing things like:

Helps grow new brain cells.

Helps your brain function faster.

Improves memory, attention and focus.

My take, if you just too freakin sick to run anywhere, find a sauna. You will feel at least a little better, and maybe a lot better.

I‚Äôm fucking scared.,"Sorry for getting all up in your guys‚Äô corner of the world. I‚Äôve never posted cause I want you all to have a safe spot. Just don‚Äôt know where else to run. Had to call 911 tonight. First time I‚Äôve ever done that. First time I‚Äôve ever seen a person‚Äôs face that color. I thought I lost him, I really did. I looked back at my phone log and I was shocked to see the 911 call was only 3 minutes. It felt like a lifetime. 

Idk, in some way I feel like I really fucked up. Maybe I should have given him more time to get out of the nod. By time the cops came knocking on the bathroom door he was semi-alert again to the point that he was eventually able to get himself out of the bathroom to get his vitals taken. They didn‚Äôt narcan him and let him sign AMA and not get checked out at the hospital. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have gotten outside parties involved. I didn‚Äôt even think about cops coming. He‚Äôs never gonna forgive me for this when he finally sobers up tomorrow and realizes the jeopardy we may potentially be in. But I‚Äôve never seen anyone turn that color before. It will haunt me for life.

Paramedics even pointed out that all our neighbors were outside staring. Our landlord lives just a couple apartments over. I had just had a discussion with her hours before about us needing to sign a new lease. I fear now we may get evicted. I am beginning to regret all this. But I will never be able to unsee his face. 

I‚Äôm not gonna lecture anyone, I know it‚Äôs not easy and no one really asks for or wants this life. But if there‚Äôs anything I can say, is that there‚Äôs gotta be at least one person in your life that wants you to stick around. Even if it‚Äôs a fellow bropiate. People care. People don‚Äôt want to ever see you turn that color. 

if you think you‚Äôve overcome your addiction and that‚Äôs in your past, with all due respect don‚Äôt get too full of yourself. he was sober over 2 years other than methadone. he tapered from 100mg down to 11 over the course of the last 2 years. it just got too hard and he reached his breaking point. and i let him. i fucking let him. at worst i thought he was relapsing. it never even occurred to me that i would see his face then that color. 

usually i‚Äôm emotional and screaming and crying, but I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve shed a single tear through this whole ordeal tonight. I feel numb and sick and regretful. I feel angry and confused and anxious. The negative feelings will hopefully go away with time. But I  never forget the color his face turned tonight. 
  
stay safe. i love you. 

edit: thanks for the kind words. sorry for invading your guys‚Äô safe space. i‚Äôve been lurking here for years but i never comment cause i don‚Äôt want to be the ‚Äòoutsider‚Äô making anyone uncomfortable or feeling judged. 

hopefully he‚Äôs out of the woods. he‚Äôs been up on and off, he‚Äôs apologized a million times and said this is the wake up call he needed. he goes to the clinic on thursday to get his bottles so he‚Äôs going to try to go up a bit until he gets acclimated. i think we were both so excited and hopeful that he was getting so close to getting off methadone, he pushed himself too hard. 

im grateful he‚Äôs alive. i‚Äôm grateful to be alive. im grateful that everyone reading this is alive. my inbox is always open if anyone ever needs an open ear. thanks again all for allowing me to get this out. no one in my life (other than his family) knows about his addiction so it‚Äôs really lonely and scary sometimes. 

double edit: i sincerely can‚Äôt thank you all enough for your kind replies. thanks so much for making me feel just as safe as i want all you to feel. take care out there, because there are strangers like me that care about you all! thanks again for letting me ramble away and not putting me down like other subs might :) ",1551853194.0

I've been shooting for probably 4 of those years. It's been 2 and a half years since I did the 38 days in jail, so I've been daily since then. I have a 2 year prison sentence on the shelf while on probation for the 2 years as long as I don't fuck up. It's going to be at least 2 or 3 months until I'm sentenced probably and start the probation.

Also, going from hydros to sub, how long of a wait? I'm reading as little as 6 hours, I would wait at least 24+ hours just wondering if anyone has experience.

Ideally I would like to start snorting the H(whatever it is), go to pills and taper off that. Eating the pills not snorting. Although whether I can get 5s or 10s is a hard question and how much it would cost. If I went to pills, then to subs, how hard would that taper be?

I'm new, so please feel free to crucify my ass if I missed something in the rules/common threads that I should have referred to.

My tolerance is insane. It's been this way since 6 months after my first heroin use. I don't remember if my doses of other opiates (hydromorph, oxycontin, oxycodone) were higher than others. I have never overdosed (no ego shit) despite using much more of the same dope than others (with similar use patterns) who overdosed.

I'm on methadone- 80mg. I was stable on 55mg but had to go up again a few times because I used (no more than 2 days of use) and my methadone wouldn't work properly. So up I'd go just to almost-stabilize. 80mg and clonidine kept withdrawal about 95% at bay- and then I used again. This time for 3 days. And wow. Even with my methadone, I have cold sweats, anxiety, yawning and sniffles, achiness. So then it becomes hard to get through that for ~4 days to the other side. So I use, and back to square one again.

Not one substitute user I know relates to this experience (shit-cycle?) when I ask about it. My doctor gives me absolutely no answer as to whether this is normal.

TLDR: My tolerance seems to have absolutely no fucking ceiling, my methadone doesn't work after I use (even briefly) and I can use an ignorant amount of heavy dope without getting a rush, let alone ODing.

I sniffed some, realized about a half hour later my pupils were still huge and I didn‚Äôt feel it so I sniffed some more and then felt this weird anxious/depressed feeling. Then I felt a panic attack coming on and I felt like I was stoned but at the same time it was nothing like being stoned.

I ended up vomiting and then falling asleep (thank god) for a few hours and now I feel almost back to normal. Still sick, but normal. I‚Äôd rather be sick than deal with that again.

(I'm not trying to get banned from my favorite sub. Just want to help promote safe drug use and awareness to those who may not know about the benefits or are too nervous to try a consumption room.)

I've been using for 7 years, 2 of those I have been using a consumption room often . It has so many great benefits and it's nice to be in a non judgmental environment around other addicts. It also helps users get the support and information they might need for rehab, homeless shelters, school, and work. Believe it or not, you can test your drugs for free , endless syringes and drug supplies, and free food. Need a nap or to get out of the cold... They'll give you a mat to nap on and at least 2 hours to rest if staffing is available. The staff are nurses and alike and they have had zero 0000 overdoses since opening. 

It is located across the street from the police station and people use in front of the building if the rooms are not available or there is a wait. There is an agreement that the police can't arrest anyone within 2 city blocks for possession or use UNLESS they are dealing or are a threat to the community... And of course, doing something illegal other than drugs. So feel free to hit your crap pipe in from of 5-0, cus they don't give a shit.... Alright alright I digress, got to keep it relevant and appropriate. 

These 2 consumption rooms were created for users and the community. The reason for users is listed above, but the community was upset at the image some drug users were giving the city. Syringes laying around on the sidewalks, people sleeping in apartment stair wells, and people using out in the open. What really sparked this idea and set things into motion, was a homeless drug user had nodded out in an apartment complex stair well and was set on fire by  teenagers. He lived

I really want to inform people about consumption rooms and hope that they begin to grow in popularity. They really are great and I can see how much they have benefited everyone in the community.

axpsos,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/axpsos/good_guy_pharmacist/,30,https://redd.it/axpsos,pack3t,Good guy pharmacist,"I've developed a pretty good relationship with one of the pharmacists at the pharmacy I go to (big W).  Every month, about a week before my fill date, I call him and have him order the Impax brand oxymorphone ER that I am prescribed (as well as oxycodone but they always have that in stock).  Last week I called him as usual and he happily said he'd order it for me and it would definitely be there by my fill date.

Well, I went to get my scripts filled and whaddya know, they don't have enough pandas to cover my script.  I am prescribed 60x20mg pandas every month but they only had 10x20mg pandas in stock.  I know they don't just ""split up"" scripts so I'm pretty frustrated but what can ya do?  I told them to fill the oxycodone and I'll wait to see what the deal is with the oxymorphone.

As I was about to leave, my friendly pharmacist was walking in and said hello to me by name (I didn't even see him, good thing he said hello!).  I told him about my troubles with the oxymorphone and he knew immediately that something was wrong because he said he ordered the bottle for me as soon as I called him last week and I'm the only patient there that is prescribed that medication.

After double checking the safe and spending a few minutes on the computer, he realized that it was his mistake.  He openly admitted that when the order came in he was extremely busy and tired (he's a new parent) and he glossed over the fact that the oxymorphone was *not* present in the order.  He ordered it immediately and said it should be there tomorrow 2-3 days.  He could see I was worried and frustrated as I told him I only had one dose left.  I asked him if I would possibly have withdrawal symptoms and also informed him that I've never been in withdrawal and I'm terrified of it after reading so many horror stories.

Then, the unexpected happened.  He ""split"" my script (which most of you probably know does *not* happen very often...like...never) and gave me the remaining 10 pandas he had in stock and said that I could get the other 50 when they came in.  He even rang it up as if I received the full 60 so that my oxycodone and oxymorphone refill dates remain on the same day and don't fall out of sync.

Sorry for the wall of text.  I just wanted to share my lucky experience (would this be considered JJ luck lol?).  Also, this shows that there are still good, compassionate pharmacists out there.  I'm a late 20's male with an ""invisible illness"" (you wouldn't know how much pain I'm in just by looking at me, but boy it's there, hence the prescriptions I get).  He's never judged me or held his power over me by making me wait or fucking around with other hoops he can make me jump through (which I've experienced with other pharmacists in the past).

**TLDR;** He made a mistake, owned the mistake, and took action to correct that mistake even though it wasn't technically ""by the book"".  No judgment or blame was passed onto me.  Shout out to my boy T for actually caring about me and having the integrity and the balls to make things right.",1551817719.0

It was much harder than it had been the first time, in ""06. Probably because of the fentdope. It's weird shit. I'm really glad I stopped before it killed me or ruined my career or relationships. Consequences could have been much worse, just some debt and a sense of failure and shame to show for my troubles. And marked up arms. But the debt will get paid, and both the tracks and the shame will fade with time.

I've been blessed with a batch of 7 Pitt bull puppies, and even more blessed with the option to take a short leave of absence from work to help Mamma Dog raise them. It's weird not going to work. It reminds me of my old life, sort of. Except for I have puppies instead of petty theft, tricks, and drugs. Puppies are WAY better!

I can't remember who it was but they told me to get ready that the police will more than likely be knocking at my door, well they didn't not it was an old friend of mine that graduated with that now is a county narcotic officer messaged me. He told me I need to come to the station to answer some question and to prove I don't have nothing to hide and I am not a drug dealer. I'm pretty fucking scared about it though because all I can think of them doing is trying to get me to incriminate myself. Because on Saturday another guy in our town OD and died so they even get the slighted Idea they could possibly charge me with his death then attempted murder I guess oh my buddy?

 I know I'm probably just thinking too much or I may not be but I know I'm scared as fuck. I asked him if I have a warrant out for my arrest or are they pressing charges and he says no, that they just want to hear my side of the story and thats it. 

I tell him im not coming up there to just get cuffs put on me.  If yall wanna do that just come by the house you know where I live. He says no I promise you you're not going to be putting in cuff and you are not going to be arrested all we want to do is talk that's it. Then I asked him do I need to bring the lawyer is it that serious he says it's serious but it's not bring a lawyer serious... 

I dont know what to do guys and girls. A part of me wants me to go prove myself and that im not a drug dealer but the other part is telling me to stay the fuck away and keep my mouth shut. Because of right now they aint got shit on me but what was said by the dad and mom. They got no text messages or anything Supposably. So why go and say something that might get me charged with something ya know. 

Please any advice will be helpful. Drop some knowledge on me please. Im stressed to the max. Im nervous as fuck. Im scared. Im upset. Its all starting to become a lil bit more than i can handle. ",1551798836.0

YES, I have read the recent posts about the analogues of fentanyl being widespread in everything from pressies to h. 

Last night my best friend was found unconscious, blue, and not breathing with a bundle in his pocket - all of which tested positive for fent. The paramedics, nurses, and doctors were all very skeptical he would make it at all, let alone without brain damage due to how long he was unconscious (20 mins). Fortunately, he pulled through and is functioning...and on his way to appear in court (which is complete bullshit - but that's for a different post).

My boyfriend is in rehab right now. Heroin/methamphetamine. He decided he wanted to do this, he was sick and tired of being sick and tired. I dropped him off on Friday, still having doubts about whether he could handle it (he's run away before, and I've had to go looking for him for days at a time, usually finding him curled up in an abandoned basement or truck, too ashamed to come home and face me). I got a phone call today from the detox center and, fearing the worst, answered it with a shaky hello. You have no idea the pride and gratitude I felt when I heard his voice on the other end. He's got a few more days of detox left, and then two weeks of inpatient, followed by two months of intensive outpatient. He's on the suboxone treatment, he says, and it's helping him feel like a normal human being again. I can't help but sob heavily, I truly believe he wants to get clean for good this time. I know we're not out of the woods yet, and in fact won't be for a while, but I am a man of God and so is he, and I believe that God is working in us right now. I just have a couple of questions for you fine folks over here, as a person who has never done anything stronger than an annual line of coke:

What can I expect from him when he gets out of inpatient, i.e. What kind of withdrawal symptoms will he still be experiencing, and what red flags do I need to watch out for that indicate he's sliding again? 

Perhaps more importantly, what can I do to support him when he comes home? I don't want to smother him and make him feel like I'm breathing down his neck 24/7, but I want to be there for him in every way possible.

Let me know if you guys have any questions so I can clarify the situation. I love him a lot and I just want him to lead a happy, healthy life, hopefully with me. ",1551773597.0

Your ridiculous superpowers.,"There is a lot of talk nowadays about neuroplasticity, how your brain can adapt to new challenges. This is vital for us addicts, because we spend a lot of time cooking our brains with nuclear option chemicals of insane potency.

Yup, that's right. Jack that speedball. Not like you are doing any damage or anything. Break on through to the other side.

Why am I talking about this?

Well, it turns out that your brain is amazing. In spite of the the ethical equivalent of child abuse that we put our brains through, they seem to have an amazing ability to morph themselves into something new. 

There was a kid that had a tumor in his brain. He was having seizures almost everyday. So doctors cut out a huge chunk of his right brain. There were fears that, of course, he would now become a drooling trainwreck of a kid and be disabled for life.

But it turns out that he is fine. The left side of his brain took over and rewired everything. Now he plays chess, goes to school and does normal kid stuff.

I am right handed. But I had an experience where I took some damage and was forced to start using my left hand. Now I am sort of ambidextrous. It is very strange.

So if you are like me and think maybe you fucked up your brain beyond all recognition, and there is nothing left for you but doom and gloom, maybe not. It may take some time and hard work, but maybe you can fix it.

I am going to sound like a terrible person and get a lot of hate. But, I DID NOT PLAN ON THIS! Found out I was pregnant in Dec. (was on BC, IT FAILED!) Dependent on Subutex, gabapentin and xanax (all legally prescribed) at the time. The DAY I found out I checked into the hospital for detox from everything. That didn't happen!
 Left me on Subutex, reduced but didnt DC my gabapentin, but did take me off the xanax. I was under the impression when they released me they would finish tapering at least the gabapentin but here I am months later and still on 300 mg 3xday. I've tried EVERYTHING I know to do to help enough with the withdrawal to quit and just cant get below that. Ive BEGGED to be put back in the hospital for them to taper the rest and they refuse. NOT  because it could be dangerous for the baby or even me, technically, but my doctor is afraid my pain will be too bad and I will relapse. I have SEVERE chronic pain and nerve damage from a car accident that broke my back in 2 places. He also worries about my mental state because I also have severe PTSD from an event I'd prefer not discussing. I keep saying, At least give me a chance! He said NOT to cold turkey, that could be dangerous but tapering as long as I can handle it will be fine. I have to take a drug test every week but honestly it would be VERY easy to sneak in clean if need be. I wont get into all of it bc this is already long but basically I would have a 4 week window to either use something else and either get it outta my system or I can check back into the hospital if I go a  route which I'll get into here... I still have PLENTY of xanax from years of saving up. I know for a fact the xanax will not hurt the baby or cause NAS as long as I only take it that 4 weeks and they will readmit me to taper me off of it in the end. (Yes, they will admit me for xanax but NOT gabapentin.) I feel like I am backed into a corner! I have a friend in the same program and her son was born on gabapentin and subutex. They detoxed her son from subutex in around 2 weeks and it was a breeze but she said the gabapentin is Hell. I DON'T WANT THAT FOR MY SON! If I could just stop it all this second I would but the doctors have scared me about stopping too much in fear of miscarriage. Also, if I am only on Subutex I can breastfeed, both I cant. I just want him to go through as little as possible. I feel so guilty! This is NOT what I planned! I also have read CBD oil will help but again I have 4 weeks before I have a blood test I cant fake so I gotta do whatever I am gonna do in that amount of time. (If it's just THC in my system they wont readmit but give me a warning and levels will have to start decreasing.) I just DONT want to go back on xanax if it wont help the gabapentin withdrawal. That's not solving anything. Same with CBD. I've tried magnesium but to no avail. Kratom was suggested but I am too leery of the side effects since it's unregulated and unlike CBD doesnt even have test results and can cause it's own withdrawal and I cant be admitted for that either. I know plenty of people that smoked pot while pregnant and their babies are perfect and even my own doctor admitted it wasnt too harmful, just illegal. (I dont plan on using pot, just CBD but just saying.) I've tried broad spectrum and it didn't help at all. Used full spectrum a couple of days before I realized it could end up showing on a test and it helped some but not enough. I am sorry for the long post, I am just so upset, ashamed, scared, and frustrated. 

Long question short, how much will xanax and CBD oil help with gabapentin withdrawal and are there any other natural things that would be safe? I also have cyclobenzaprine, clonodine, vistiril, and reglan all approved from doctor and I believe he has said topomax is safe but Id have to double check. Again, the xanax is only dangerous at this point if I didnt go in within the month to get back off. 

Please keep the judging at a minimum, I didnt plan for this and I am doing the absolute best I can with what I was handed! Thank you for any help! ",1551747364.0

I've been a regular IV user of (almost solely) oxymorphone for going on 8 years with no known ""blood disorders"" and it would be surprising if this community didn't know the tricks.

Edit: for clarification, I'm referring only to the crushable IR and generic ER versions. The name brand ""plastic"" ER pills can cause endocarditis more easily than other injectable pills, but they can be shot. Prep is relatively easy and quick, actually.

Also, I'd be more than happy to explain the process for those interested - just let me know.

I've been a long time lurker (this is a throw away account) and I've been off blues and on Suboxone since the first of the year. This subreddit has helped me so much! I got to the point where the real pharma 30's did nothing for me, even if I took 10 throughout the day, and I was taking around 5 presses a day and having to track them down every other day and I was just miserable. 

&#x200B;

I'm taking 8mg of Suboxone daily and no one in my life knows (that I'm aware of) that I'm an addict besides my dealers and my Suboxone doctor, not even my husband. I need to have a myomectomy next month and I'm afraid to tell my gynecologist that I'm on Suboxone. I talked to my Suboxone doctor and he said that if I don't want to tell her I should just tell the anesthesiologist right before they put me under. He said if I don't want to admit to being an addict that I can say I take it for Fibromyalgia. I feel like if i tell the anesthesiologist I might as well just woman up and tell my gynecologist. won't both doctors talk to each other? I think my real fear is that if I tell them, it will come up several times during my stay at the hospital and my family might find out. 

&#x200B;

Is my pain med tolerance going to be through the roof? This surgery is pretty routine but they will be cutting my lower stomach open similar to a c-section and I know that recovery can be painful. What should I do? Is this the part of my recovery where I come clean to everyone? I'm not ready for that. BTW, I'm not so worried about relapsing or taking pain meds during my hospital stay. I feel like my tolerance is so high it won't even be fun. I just don't want to be in extreme pain. ",1551742459.0

Not what I expected,"So this was about 3 years ago, I had smoked and sniffed heroin a bunch of times before I Ivd and never really understood the fuss. So I'm with this junky mf'er who used to he a heroin addict but was currently slamming shittons of meth to deal with quitting H. After a while of chilling and smoking my weed ( dude would smoke a bowl of my shit everytime I went to the bathroom lol) a homeless dude comes over that I had fought before. Junky #1 says ""bro let's get some H! 50 a point!"". I'd never purchased heroin before for myself so I said fuck it okay. Hand him a 50 and homeless guy and junky #1 go into kitchen to weigh it out. Naturally Im Curious about what is going on so I step into the kitchen and Junky#1 steps in front of homeless guy with the scale and says ""you gotta stay in the living room K"". I thought this was just because homeless dude was a sketched out tweaker or was still afraid of me. So homeless dude leaves and junky #1 brings bag into bathroom and says ""I'll get you a shot ready"". I'm like ""okay how many shots you think I can get out of a point after sharing some with you?"" ""Probably 2 or 3 bro"". 
     So I took 3 shots which I'm guessing were really small cuz no pin pricks or rush to be found. Then I smoke a blunt and am immediately stoned af, I was thinking damn must have smoked a super nug or something cuz I'd kind of pushed the H out of my mind disappointed in the experience. So Junky keeps going into the bathroom like 5 or 6 times and I'm starting to get suspicious that a point is 50 bucks cuz I'm the only one who bought H from the homeless dude. Jimmy is shooting in bathroom and I go into his bedroom and there is a ball of BTH the size of time. I'm fucking pissed because there is two things I hate and it's ""friends"" who lie and steal.
     Junky comes out of bathroom and sits on couch I say""can I get another shot bro"" ""nah man it's gone""
At this point I start fucking with him cuz I was still in football and basketball I'm like 6'2 205lbs and this guy is scrawny and a bitch. I pull ball of bth out of where I set it in my backpack and don't say anything. Junky doesn't even notice I pulled it out so I clear my throat and stand up and just sucker punch this dude while he's nodding on the couch then grab my shit and leave. 
    At this point in driving home and all of the sudden I can't keep my eyes open and I start to get scared because it's dark and I have about a ten minute drive to get home and I can't keep my fucking eyes open. I hold one open with my fingers while I'm driving. I make it home fine and immediately go downstairs to my room and pass out. Over the next week I finished what turned out to be .4 of the bth by smoking it. Haven't touched H since then. So I thought you were supposed to get a rush from H all I got was super sleepy after about a whole hour? Overall I used to get more euphoria from Kratom when I first started.

Even though I am excited about trying new pharmaceuticals, to be added to my list; I am kinda worried about the synergy of brotizolam and opioids. I am prescribed 30mg ms-contin (morphine sulfate extended release) for pains daily, and added clonazepam(0,5-1mg if needed) or bromazepam (3-6mg if needed) (prescribed too) for extra sedation (to go sleep, or to relieve stress.)

Should i be worried about combining the brotizolam with my daily prescribed morphine? I am not the type to overdo things, so if I get my hands on the brotizolam tablets, i'm not gonna do more than 1 per night. I would also choose to use 15mg of morphine instead of 30mg. From what I've read is that brotizolam 0,25mg is close to a 1mg rohypnol tablet etc.

I never do experience bad breathing or respiratory depression, so should I be worried? I'm getting a tripsitter during the tryout of brotizolam.

I thought I'd previously read that Clonidine and Neuroton (sp?) are 2, but I'm not sure what symptoms they help with.  Is there anything else crucial to enduring the process?  Not really looking forward to night sweats or stomach issues.  

&#x200B;

I've been thinking about quitting for a while now, but a recent development has kind of forced my hand.  I'm in pain management for legit back issues and have been prescribed oxycodone in various doses for about 15 years.  The highest dose was around 205mg per day.  I was on that for 10 years, but with all the new FDA rules and such, I have been drastically cut to around 75mg per day for the last year or so; which sucks but I've adjusted as best as I can.  I just considered myself lucky to still have a doctor willing to prescribe opiates for pain. 

&#x200B;

 All that changed a couple of days after my last appointment when the DEA raided her office.  According to her, they're investigating whether she's assisting patients with 'diverting' pain pills to the streets, which is ludicrous.  This woman is the strictest, most by the book doctor I've ever been to.  She performs random drug tests, and not just urinalysis. She's also conducted blood draws, hair follicle, and saliva tests in case patients are some how circumventing the piss tests and she's immediately discharged those that have street drugs in their system or those with none of the prescribed meds.  She also calls people in for pill counts, which I've never had to do with any doc before, and she's cut down patients (like me) with what the FDA now considers high doses.

&#x200B;

Bottom line is, she knows her shit and she complies with all federal regulations and guidelines.  According to her, she was not arrested and the DEA did not suspend/revoke her license to prescribe, but they did ask her to not to write any more until their investigation concludes.  That was nearly a month ago.  It seems to me like they've already investigated her and couldn't find anything on her, so this is the tactic they use to either intimidate legit doctors or force them to close, since technically, they can keep an investigation open for years.  

&#x200B;

As such, its probably better if I just quit and suffer rather than trying to find another doctor since they're almost extinct anyway.  I don't want to trade one dependency for another, so Suboxone is out and I can't really afford to be away from work and family to go to rehab, so I'll just try to quit cold turkey.  I know there are medical concerns with this method and it's easier said than done, but I'm going to try it.

ax19sd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ax19sd/question_about_visiting_a_specialist_that/,9,https://redd.it/ax19sd,swanzy1,Question about visiting a specialist that prescribes Suboxone,"So I‚Äôm ready to just be off this wild ride already. My relationship with dope is love hate just like anybody else‚Äôs. When I actually have money and have dope I‚Äôm on top of the world. My mood is great and I‚Äôm an overall very enjoyable person. 

More often than not though, I‚Äôm short on cash, bills pile up, making small amounts of dope stretch because I‚Äôm terrified of withdrawals. 

I don‚Äôt own a laptop of any kind and have never set up the dark net, so I‚Äôm always making 1 hour round trips to the city to pay 100+ dollars for ‚Äúdimes‚Äù and can never get my plug to actually hook me up with solid weight despite how much money I always spend. 

I‚Äôm terrified of withdrawals because I like to think I live a somewhat normal life that an entire week of being out of commission would ruin it all and give everything away completely. 

I went through it once about a month and a half ago and had to take like 6 days off from work, actually had to visit my family doctor (which costed more money) and provide doctors notes and the whole nine yards. My girl and my fam just chalked it up as me being super fucking sick with the flu until I scored more powder and leveled myself out .

So my plan is to score just like, a weeks worth of subs to get myself through the ugly part of the withdrawals and I know I‚Äôll be in so much better shape than the other times I tried quitting. I can never find anybody selling subs on the street though, and I‚Äôm just curious how these visits go with the ‚Äúsuboxone doctors‚Äù 

I saw a post about a week or two ago of a user who was pretty confident in the method of going into withdrawals on day one, and then visiting the methadone clinic for only like 3 days or something and then letting the long half-life of the methadone ride you out for the last 3-4 days of W/D‚Äôs - if you‚Äôre that user, please tell me more.

But anywhoo, I wanna try the suboxone route first. I‚Äôve used subs recreationally before and I just know they‚Äôd get me off of being sick just enough for me to function throughout the week or two it would take to set me free. I understand after that it‚Äôs all willpower and I‚Äôm confident in the fact that I hate what dope has done to me to the point that I‚Äôll be able to stay away once the physical pull is gone. 

So when you visit these doctors, do they like, have to prescribe me suboxone as an addiction remedy? I have a cousin that receives 90 8mg strips a month and he made it sound like he literally went in there and admitted his addiction to opiate pain pills, complained of a bad back and boom, he was instantly receiving scripts of this shit. 

The couple of places I‚Äôve called to attempt to set up an appointment though made it very clear that the initial doctors visit is paid for up front out of pocket, no insurance involved. 

I‚Äôm not sure if my insurance covers the actual suboxone, my luck is it does NOT, but I‚Äôve heard from this same cousin of mine that you can purchase subs from the pharmacy (with a script of course) by the single digits for like, 10 bucks a pop or something. 

I just don‚Äôt have the extra money to waste on a doctors visit that‚Äôs not going to get me anything out of it. This wild ride with this wicked drug has taken so much out of me the past 3 months and literally feel like I‚Äôm at my breaking point. 

Any advice at all would be amazing. I‚Äôm down to my last (5) dimes that I have to make stretch the next couple of days until I can sell some shit of mine to scrape up another $60-$100 and hopefully score some 4mg subs from a lady my tweaker middle man set me up with....

... what I life I‚Äôve found myself in. 


TL;DR - I‚Äôm sick of relying on dope to function, curious about what a doctors visit for some good ol suboxone entails. 


Thanks for listening y‚Äôall. Felt pretty good to just type all of this bullshit out. Sorry if it‚Äôs just adding another pity post to the sub. I know a lot of ppl on here are quite understanding and supportive though.

That's why I'm asking. When you overdose, for a while before losing consciousness, would you be at least somewhat aware of what's going on around you, despite being unable to respond? Or once you've reached near total unresponsivity, have you also lost your ability to take in anything from your senses?

So I'm on my way to get it and he says gotta be here before 11:45A.M before my mom gets here. I said I can do. I was there by 11:15A.M. we exchange and I tell him, i gotta go to work for 2 or 3 hours. I gotta clear coat 1 kitchen counter top and a bathroom sink counter and go to the unit below that one and flake those counters and ill be done then ima come back over and kick it and get high. 

I get to the apartment complex im working at for the day around 1:45P.M. I get a call no later than 2:15P.M, my sister, she says, brother, what the fuck did you give him. I said wat the fuck are you talking about. She said you know exactly what i mean. Hmm no I don't I said. She said, brother, he OD, he is not breathing and isnt showing any signs of life. Said he locked his self in a room and done it. And to add to it. His girl was with him. Shes in the other room in the same condition. I begin to scream and freak out. Balling me eyes out. Im so scared at this point. About 20 mins goes by and I get another text saying, they pronounced him dead. And his girl friend is unstable. I just know im about to catch 2 account of man slaughter. 

About 5 more mins pass and I get another text, he just woke up outta no where, they are checking him out to make sure everything is okay. Basically it's a fucking miracle tbh. He shouldn't be here. When i say so much weight was lifted off of me. I was literally already starting to go crazy about thinking i killed my friend. I mean im not the drug, i didnt sell them to him I was just the car ride he didnt have. But I still felt as if it was my fault.

So his parents are beyond pissed off at me. They never wanna see me again. They told the cops I was the heroin dealer supposedly. Getting threats like how his dad is gonna try and kill me for what i done. Im just so lost.
 Right now. Evem though he made it along with his girl friend I still feel like a total piece of shit. I'm just not sure why im even here anymore. I just wanna go. 

But all this has opened my eyes big time. Even though i dont wanna live. Im still going to the methadone clinic bright and early Monday morning when the doors open at 5:00A.M. I cant keep doing this to my self. I need a change before i really end up doing some shit i cant take back. But yeah scared straight for sure!!!

awr853,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/awr853/sooooo_heroin/,14,https://redd.it/awr853,FendA1,sooooo.... heroin.,"Hey everyone, im not too sure what im doing here but i thought this might be a good place to just tell my story. I'm not exactly sure why I'm doing this, but fuck it im going to do it anyway. I attempted to post to r/drugs but got a ton of hate so maybe this community might be a bit more understanding about my situation. I'm not too sure what I'm trying to get out of this, Advice? Guidance? Maybe just someone to acknowledge my existence but here goes.

So, the first time I tried heroin was when I was still a teenager (19 to be exact and 22 atm), prior to this opiates weren't exactly new to me. I had a ton of experience with oxy after my grandfather passed away and me being the sick depressed anxious person I am decided that I would steal his entire stash. Was it morally wrong? Maybe. Not really mine to say, I just remember me and my family cleaning out his house and 17 yo me finding a shoe box under his bed filled to the brim with oxy. I'm not too sure what prompted me too take them, was kind of like I was looking at myself from above, something inside me just decided to take them. I looked around the room, looked at the box, looked around the room again and shoved the box in my backpack and didn't really give it a second thought.

As you can probably guess I indulged heavily and my massive supply allowed me to maintain a steady habit. Before trying oxy i had some experience with lean but found it to be quite overrated, but good enough when combined with some good weed and Valium or Xanax, anyways im getting off topic. I remember the first night i attempted to snort 4 5mg oxys, it was futile as the amount of powder to get up my nose was enormous so the whole experience was stunted to say the least. I felt slightly giddy, sleepy and went to bed thinking that oxy was a massive letdown. The next night however i decided to just eat them instead, within half an hour i was in bliss, floating on a silk cloud, i realized how fucked up i was when i noticed that i had been simply staring at my blank laptop for over an hour, just basking in the beautiful opiate-induced sun. Needless to say, i began to take them heavily and regularly. I look back on those days with nostalgia.

I began to take them before school and soon realized that if i didn't over indulge i could quite effectively spend the entire day in the clouds and no one knew. i kept up a constant habit for 3 straight months and no one noticed, not one fucking person. I guess looking back on it now it was perfect for my personality, i was extremely introverted, shy and socially anxious so no one really could tell i was on something. i didn't have a heap of friends anyway so i'd just go to all my classes with my headphones in high as fuck, although most of my time I didn't even attend class. Preferring to isolate myself in the music storeroom playing guitar or going to the park to smoke cigarettes and read. I don't what it is but something about being surrounded by old cello's, violins, piano's and sheet music comforted me more than any other place. After school I'd typically go home and smoke weed, take more oxy and then when wait until my girlfriend at the time finished work. I'd go to hers, drop a couple more oxy, we'd fuck or just talk and then she would fall asleep while i spent the night staring at the ceiling while she slept next to me until she woke up the next morning while i had not slept and we went to school, rinse, repeat for about 3 months.

All good things must come to an end however and i had to eventually kick the habit after my supply ran out. I simply told my mother i had food poisoning and spent 2 weeks shitting and puking. However, unfortunately this was not my last contact with opiates. Fast forward to me being 19, I was still a heavy drug user but more of a poly substance abuser rather than one particular chemical. I simply took any or all opiates, benzo's, barbs and weed that i could find. For some reason, i had no interest at all in amphetamines.

Anyhow, one night, and i remember this incredibly vividly, it was dark, stormy and windy. Me and my drug buddy were spending the night getting fucked up and playing video games, waiting for our plug to arrive with some klonopin and lean. He knocked on the door and my heart rate skyrocketed as my body primed to induce kpins and sip some lean with some nice indica. He came in, we had some cones together and he gave us the shit. He was just about to walk out the door when he spun around and said 'Hey, I'm not sure if you guys are interested but i got some new shit. Managed to score some pure china white heroin.'. The mention of the H word at the time sent me for a spin and i looked at my friend. It was that look were you don't need to say anything however we both knew exactly what was about to happen.

After he left I stared at the small white rocks he had given us and both decided that i would be the one to first do it. I took a single rock out of the bag and placed it on the foil. Chasing the dragon wasn't completely foreign to me as i had done it a few times with oxy. As soon as the flame hit the foil a thick line of smoke began to rise and I attempted to inhale as much of it as i could. It tasted slightly sour, almost like vinegar. As I inhaled as much smoke as i could i held it in for as long as i could, a feeling swept over me. It felt like someone has poured a warm bucket of water over my head and as the water began to trickle down my neck all my worries, anxieties and problems simply dissipated with it. This wasn't like benzo's, barbs, alcohol or cannabis where my problems were simply numbed. With heroin, they just dissipated as easily as the smoke did when i exhaled. I let out a long sigh as i exhaled and fell back into the couch, the experience felt almost spiritual, something entirely different from anything i had done prior.

However, my plug went off to rehab for a benzo addiction the following week, so my dance with the devil was only for a night. Until recently. Through a variety of circumstances I met up with a friend I had not seen for a long time, this particular person, while incredibly down to earth and friendly had chosen a dark path in life and had started to hang out with some particular people that aren't exactly sanitary. He had started to smoke a lot of meth and began to rob people and shops and went to jail for it. One insanely bizarre experience happened when it was very late at night and i was walking home from a party or something. All of a sudden 3 people jump out of a car with t-shirt's wrapped around their faces demand my phone and wallet, when one of the boys unwrapped the shirt around his face and its my fucking friend, he turned from his drug-induced haze into the friendliest guy, asked what i had been up to, how I was doing and gave me a hug. He then apologized for the misunderstanding and they drove off, my valuables still in my pockets as i stood still thinking what the fuck just happened.

I distanced myself from him as while I wasn't exactly straight either, the shit he was doing and the person he was becoming was not something i enjoyed being around and methamphetamine was something that i neither enjoyed and also had seen a lot of my old friends fall victim too. While talking and reminiscing about the wack shit we used to get up too being young teenagers he asked if he could tell that he was on heroin, like the night i first did it the mention of the word sent my heart rate skyrocketing, i hadn't danced with the devil for 2 years but i cant say it wasn't on my mind, although buried deep in it. I asked him for his plug, knowing it was a bad decision to make but doing it anyway just like when i stole my grandfathers oxys all those years ago. He gave it to me no problems, we said our goodbyes and parted ways.

For 2 weeks i stared at the number in my phone, debating whether i should call or not. Compared to the vast majority of my friends I was doing okay in life. I had a steady job as a bartender, attended university despairingly and tried my best to indulge in music and reading while still maintaining my massive hedonistic substance abuse. Despite this my mental and physical health was horrible. I had a horrific sleep schedule, would rarely eat and then get stoned and take Xanax and eat massive amounts of fast food that would make me horribly sick. I was depressed, spending days in bed, incredibly anxious and i had practically isolated myself from everyone after high school. I had not had a intimate relationship for almost 4 years and I was lonely as fuck, finding solitude and release in pornography.

One day, after a particularly terrible day i decided fuck it, ill call. To my surprise a quiet girl answered, she asked my name and how i got this number. I mentioned my friends name, i asked for what i wanted and she texted me the address and asked that i text her when i was 5 minutes or so away. Also surprisingly was that the address she had given was only about a 10 minute drive from my home. Fuck.

I arrive and in 30 seconds a rather cute girl jumps into my passenger seat. For a moment she seems surprised, i guess i didn't look like her normal clientele, I drive a car on the nicer end of things for my age and (not to be narcissistic) I've been told that I am quite good looking and I like to keep myself relatively well kept. She looks at me and then looks at her feet, I notice the self harm marks on her arms and the tracks marks that are scattered along her armpits and legs like craters on the moon. She's about my age and despite her physically concerning attributes i found myself kinda attracted to her, i don't know if that sounds fucked up but its nice to know that other people are struggling like me ya know? She drops a small bag in the cup holder of my car, I give her the money and she mumbles something and gets out. To be honest, it was the easiest drug transaction I had ever done. No waiting around for bud and benzo dealers. The interaction was over in 30 seconds.

I drive the 10 minutes home, my heart practically in my throat, i feel sick with excitement and anticipation. I recede to the comfort of my room and look at the package. 100$ Australian Dollars for 3 small white rocks in a small plastic bag, 2 points of pure(ish) china white heroin. Again I reconsider my life leading up to this point, reconsider my decision purchasing this harmful drug but as soon as i do the inner demon comes out and like a puppet I crush the powder of 1 rock and snort and the bucket of blissful, clean, pure, holy water was once again poured over my head and down my shoulders.

That was 2 months ago, I have managed to purchase it only once a week but even this habit is expensive. I don't know where to go, i dont fit in with the junkies and i dont fit in with normal people either. Do I abandon my habit or let it consume me. I often think, maybe if i tried, that things could get better. A nice wife and some kids sounds good. Maybe i can teach them piano scales like my grandfather had done for me when i was young, the same grandfather who i stole all his pain medication from his cancer treatment after he had died. but hey, heroin sounds nice aswell ya know. The comforting spiritual bliss is a 5 minute drive away, shes always around and it has not once been a fuckaround to get.

 It's always in my mind and sometimes i swear i smell it randomly, to distance myself from this insanity i'm working 7 days a week 10 hours a day just so i have no energy to go anywhere except to go home, injest a fuckton of valium and xanax until i pass out and drag myself out of bed to do it all again. Although theres a part of me thats just thinking you're only working heaps so you can rationalize buying more H. It's amazing how quick this drug has got a hold of me. It's almost like a girlfriend, shes sweet and beautiful and makes me happy. But she doesnt love me back and when i wake up in the morning shes not they're next to me. But im still there, just a little poorer, a little weaker and wishing she'd come back with just an empty plastic bag to remind me of her.

Sorry this is so long and if you have read this far i thank you, whoever you are. I didn't intend for it to be this long but once i started typing i couldn't really stop. I kinda guess that everyone is going to tell me to stop using, I know that. I'm not sure why im writing this, just to get it out i guess even if no one reads it at all.

Anyways thankyou again, i hope you are all well, and if you're not I hope you are soon. :)",1551593008.0

One night I stole seven Ativan out of the bottle in Larry‚Äôs coat pocket while he slept in a pile of trash in the corner. It had been a hard night for me, because I was sick and mostly unable to sleep from a lack of heroin. He sat up and patted his chest to feel for the bottles when he woke up at around 10 and pulled the bottles out. Eleven pills had turned into four while he slept. He looked at me angry and desperate. I said, 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù

I made empty promises to repay him, but when he demanded proof, I ripped the microwave out of the wall and stuffed it into the red roll-around suitcase. It still had a laminated card from my grandmother‚Äôs travel agency and my own information from my flight to New Mexico. 

‚ÄúCall Luna! Tell him to bring a dub!‚Äù A dub is a twenty-dollar bag. 

‚ÄúWhat? You think he is going to want that nasty little thing? You‚Äôve lost it.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust call him! I‚Äôll deal with him when he gets here!‚Äù

Larry called our dealer, and I could tell Luna was trying to confirm that we had money over the phone, but Larry danced around it until Luna agreed to come anyway. I slid my arms into the sleeves of my NASCAR racing jacket and headed across the parking lot with Larry hobbling on crutches. It was a no. 24 Jeff Gordon racing jacket, bright red with blue flames up the sleeves and a bright blue DUPONT logo on the front. My mom had ordered it for me brand-new, to replace the old dirty one she made me throw away in California. Larry‚Äôs crutches creaked in the cold across the asphalt. The suitcase rolled behind me and half of the microwave stuck out. The power cord dragged behind.

awpubg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/awpubg/post_from_a_retired_chipper/,22,https://redd.it/awpubg,staysafenodout,Post from a retired chipper,"Hey I just figured out my old password to this account, so that's why it's been six years without posting. Just wanted to share a little bit and open up a dialogue about chipping.

I wanted so badly to be able to get high on opioids and particularly heroin as a recreational substance like I did with cannabis. Oxycodone was awesome but expensive. I compare it to a completely lucid drunkish high which also gave me the feeling like I was loved and accepted. 

Getting the first needle high was the point of no return, though. I absolutely disagree with some people saying it's only about the rush for shooting up. It's free from any nausea and it felt like an even cleaner high to me. Feel free to convince me otherwise though. 

Anyway I had always promised myself that if I did 3 days on and 1 day or more off I would not get withdrawal, and if I ever broke the rule then I had to quit. This went well for about 6 months, but eventually I did a 4th day. I quit, and only relapsed a few times as a one-time thing over the next few months. I kicked for real with the support of friends and other loved ones though.

The only way I could keep it together was to smoke weed every night and focus on school. Then I graduated and had to quit that for employment drug tests. The cravings came back hard...

The best way I've found to manage without popping for a drug test is to use kratom. It barely curbs the cravings, but it works enough that besides checking this sub as a lurker daily, I don't feel tempted to cold cop in the city or anything. Luckily I seem to be completely immune to any withdrawal symptoms from kratom, perhaps it's because I only use a few grams at a time and never once experienced opiate/opioid withdrawal. Must be the partial antagonist acting like an uldn-opioid combination? I'd love to discuss this further with anyone.

The point of this post though is to show young chippers that it's not worth it. You end up thinking about dope everyday even if you quit. If you're dead set on chipping, my suggestion is to wait until you're older. if you ignore this advice it's very possible you'll end up focused on dope instead of life, and you'll be addicted and without any skills or education and no money to fall back on. Safe your money, invest it wisely, and go to the dnm once you have several million in the bank or something. Make sure you can afford a gram a day for the rest of your days as an old ass William Burroughs motherfucker, it is not a good idea to roll the dice with opiate/opioid addiction early in life.

I brought enough perks (or so I thought) to last me the trip. Well by the time I was 3/4 of the way there I had 2 left and I knew I was going to be sick if I didn‚Äôt get something. So what do I do? Cold cop!!

So I head into the heart of the biggest city on the way when I‚Äôm almost to The deep south and I figure find some homeless dude, they will know where to score! So I take my opportunity when a homeless man asks me for chips. I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy you chips if you can tell me where the boys at‚Äù he eyed me up and told me. I went in and got him chips. 

On my way out I decided I just wanted his help. I rolled down my window and said I‚Äôll pay him if he will just come with me. He agreed and hops in my car. We go to where his people normally are. Nobody there. So we go to his backup. It‚Äôs this drunk black dude standing outside a gas station. I immediately don‚Äôt like this anymore but god damnit did I need something to hold me over til I got home. 

The dude jumps in my back seat and we go to where I thought his boy was. Turns out I was picking his girlfriend up. Whatever. We get her and finally go to the dope house. He goes in and cops me 2 10 sacks and we are outtie. I drop his girl off and I go to drop him off. He starts asking me for money. I have him 5 bucks and said bye. He got this blank stare in his eye and I started to reach for my concealed carry. He snaps back and says some dumb shit and hops out. I drop off the 1st homeless person and I finally make my way out of town

I get to a good spot and go to bust it up. It looked kinda grey. I wasn‚Äôt sure and I didn‚Äôt care but I go to smell it and what is it?! FUCKING COCAINE! I was sososo mad!

This past November marked 4 years opiate free and I had an interesting method to obtain this goal that I figured I would share.

I was a functioning heroin addict working 5 days a week doing $100 bags a day. Always sniffing, never got to the needle. Anyways I had tried 100s of times to quit before but nothing ever worked and the withdrawals were too much and I would always cave. I believed that if I could somehow get past the withdrawal symptoms then I would be golden- so here is how I was able to do that. 

*It is important to note that I very badly wanted to get clean and if this method did not work I was going to seek serious help and quit my job*

This is a three week ‚Äúdetox‚Äù that allows you to live a normal life, sleep, work, etc. This may not work for everyone but it did for me so I hope it can for you too. The three things you will need to complete this detox are adderall, neurontin(gabapentin, ‚Äújohnnies‚Äù), and klonopin.

The first week I would take a combination of adderal(15mg) and neurontin(900mg) when I woke up to get me through the day. Early afternoon I would take a klonopin(.5-1mg) to take the edge off. This combination of drugs is extremely euphoric(would compare it to a small roll of ecstasy) and completely took my mind off of the opiates leaving my body. I would then take another klonopin in the evening so I could sleep, rinse repeat.

The second week the opiates are completely out of my system and the worst part of the withdrawals are already over with. This week I eliminated the johnnies as to not become dependent on them, and moved my kpin usage to once a day. So adderall in the morning and kpins at night to sleep.

The third week I eliminated the kpins, but continued with the adderal in lower doses. The toughest part of this is being able to sleep, so I substituted the kpins for an OTC sleep aid (NyQuil Zzzs for instance). 

If you can successfully get through these 3 weeks you will have *hopefully* avoided dependence on the three crutches and completely avoided withdrawal symptoms altogether. Anyway it worked for me so I believe if done correctly it can work for you too.

Good luck fellow users. I have been to the depths of addiction and back and believe it has made me incredibly stronger in the long run. I hope you can all find inner peace (when you are ready of course üòâ)",1551550294.0

Now I'm freaking out.,"Hey my fellow bropiates, I've got a question for y'all. So, I just cooked up a shot of BTH same as I do multiple times a day. This time, however, I actually hit a vein immediately. That doesn't really happen anymore, so you can imagine both my surprise and excitement. So I took my shot. However, something that hadn't occurred to me before is that the time it takes me to hit a vein, is also the time my shot has to cool down. Tonight, when I hit so quickly, I took advantage of that shit. So I pushed the whole shot in. When unwrapped the belt from around my arm, immediately my thumb and the heel of my hand started BURNING like I had dunked it into boiling water. My hand IMMEDIATELY swelled up a lot. Like, so much that my thumb literally felt like the skin was going to split down the side, the skin was so tight. My skin also appeared to be burned, woth raised white and red splotches from the spot on my forearm where I hit the vein all the way down to my fingertips. The splotches have gone away, but my hand is still discolored and whiter than it should be, as well as being still swollen, though I have gotten more used it. Also, my hand went numb for about 20/30 minutes, as well. I started writing this post then, but then my asshole brother started yelling at me about how much of a piece of shit I am, and I had to put this aside for a moment. 

So, as of now, my hand is still really swollen. My thumb feels fucking huge and the pressure in it when I bend it to do fucking anything at all is awful. The spot where I initially hit and did my shot is still stinging as well. I guess my question is: has anyone had this experience before? Have I done irreversible damage? Will my thumb ever go back to normal? Is that vein still usable at all? I'm getting back on my suboxone in like 2 days, so it would really be poetic justice that the last bag of dope I bought to finish off this relapse and get back on my subs would be the bag that fucks me up for good. Lowkey freaked out, although not nearly as bad as when it first happened. ",1551530171.0

Why am I feeling this way right now? My parents picked me up off the streets from a different state about two weeks ago. I was homeless and just panhandling for crack and ice. (ironically moved to this state to get clean from H, but found out the whole place is a fucking DOPE HOLE and lost every single possession I had. From my car to my apartment with ALL of my clothes in it). 


I would get ten bucks together, get a shot or a hit, and rinse and repeat. Was the same routine every fucking day. But it's not the drugs I'm missing. I can get those here. 




I miss the street life. I really don't know what it is. I loved seeing and recognizing fellow homeless people/addicts on the street, as well as being recognized by them, feeling belonged, and welcomed in a way? The conversation would always be the same every single time. Usually it'd start out with ""how much you got??"" and if we had enough we'd go half on a dime. 




I miss the drug dealers. I miss walking into the trap house or motel room to be served and feeling welcomed and belonged. I miss hitting my stem in his tents in his back yard, even though immediately after I'd  ALWAYS feel like I was being set up, by the fellow crack heads, or the dealer himself, to be arrested. 


Not one person knew my name out there. Yet I've never felt more belonged. I've never felt more like I've fit in somewhere except the streets. I also know that not a single one of those people gave a FUCK about me. They only cared if I had something they could use me for. Be it money, drugs or a connect. My head made me feel like they were 'friends', knowing full well they were the furthest thing from that. 


What is wrong with my head right now? I have no body else to vent about this to. I am posting here because I feel at least one person here has to feel the same way. I know it is not a rational feeling *at all*. 

Why would I want to go back to sleeping at Waffle Houses? Or behind abandoned buildings? Why would I want to go back to having paranoid episodes, literally so in fear of the law, that I'd throw all of my belongings, like my backpack, or my phone away to avoid possible incriminating evidence, even though I knew there was nothing in there to begin with?? 


Why would I want to go back to going WEEKS without a shower? 

Why would I want to go back to BEGGING for money? 

What the fuck is wrong with me? I'm home right now in my warm bed with my lovely dog, safe, with free food in the fridge, yet I feel home sick. Please. Somebody tell me they have felt the same.

I turn my hand over to see the faded but still prominent H burned into my hand.


‚ÄúThis one?‚Äù I say pointing to it, while I remember every ‚Äúlast‚Äù cigarette that led to my personal brand.


‚ÄúNot that one, the H is for our family. These lines here‚Äù pointing to a large, dark, carving on my forearm.


I am glad that Ty can't yet read the ‚ÄúI AM DEATH‚Äù that the lines spell out. But nevertheless I know he will press for an answer. 


I struggle in a fit of ‚Äúummm and well you see‚Äù until my wife takes notice. 


Dark curled hair frames her face, as her mahogany eyes read my silent plea for help.


Calmly she says ‚ÄúTy some things don't need an explanation‚Äù, picking him up to play with our other two boys. I mouth ‚Äòthank you‚Äô to her as she subtly smiles.


It is only the second talk during church and I'm already seeing patterns in the stucco. Staring at the words suddenly and intensely took me straight to the moment I made them. 



In a blink, I'm 21, living at my parents, driving my shitty 2001 Altima, and losing my mind again‚Ä¶



I was losing a battle with an unknown neurological disorder, or that's what the doctors thought. For a while I was prescribed various antidepressants and antipsychotics. But I was blessed with the occasional script of oxy and a monthly supply of Klonopin, but those had run out a week ago.


The grips of withdrawal had consumed me, the stabbing pain, vomiting, and constant the nausea and flu, of opiate withdrawal showed my mask dying. I had never been in benzodiazepine withdrawal before but, the mix of oxy, klonopin, and a few drinks was blissful. Alone or not I didn't care, the months supply was gone within 10 days, and then madness set in. I saw walls melt, carpets turn to water, cars change color, and voices came to whisper indistinguishable noises in my ear. After two weeks of this my sanity hung by a thread.


My ‚Äúbest‚Äù friend at the time asked me to be his best man that night, and normally I would have been excited, but in withdrawal it put a wrench in my plan to end it all. Isopropyl alcohol induced liver failure was my plan, but now I had an obligation.


Instead I decided on a new plan and began meticulously carving into my epidermis. The words ‚ÄúI AM DEATH‚Äù bled into my Meeseeks robe, followed by a baking soda chemical burn. 


Words now there forever as a reminder of the inevitable price to be paid. 


With my gaze fixed, my wife senses I'm lost again. She places her hand on my scars, she knows of the demons within. Knowing the secret habits, tastes, and slip ups, that I kept hidden. Slowly she brings my eyes up to hers and I emerged from the icy depths of my past, gasping for breath. 


After a few dirty looks I knew where I was. I tried my best to forget the words, with my wife's hand as my only anchor to this world...

Hit one today.

When you first start going to that spot, it's one of many. over time, you favor it more and more over the others. During this time, it gains your trust and you can rely on it. You like it. it becomes your go-to site. Eventually you start to go there exclusively. it's everything you want and need.

 Its gets you through tough times. its been there through good times. it was there when your family member died,  when you got sick, when you celebrated that one holiday, when you graduated, when it was sunny, when it was rainy. it was just there for you. You loved it.

you keeping smashing it till one time it doesn't respond out of no where. Meh, it happens. So you go somewhere else for now. It was just a fluke you think, that's all. You go back to it and try again and it's ok again. But then after that, it's not. Then its ok again. Jeez you think, this motherfucker is bipolar. You keep trying and nothing seems to help it be 100% loyal.

You look for another spot that takes care of your needs. You experiment with others And then remember this one spot that you thought was promising before you went exclusive.  its still there, waiting for you to make a move. its young, fresh and you just click with it. you start going back and forth. the new spot is different, and the old spot was always there for you. You are torn.

you want to make it work. You keep trying. you are hoping it'll just do what it had been doing like before. But it just won't connect with you anymore, no matter what you do. All you do is hurt it. Nothing good happens when you go to it.

You know you should leave it alone. Everytime you go to it, you just cause damage and unrealistic expectations. You know you should stop trying. You know its toxic for you. the best thing to do for both of you is to just not go there anymore. you should let it heal and move on. you are sad but have no choice but to avoid it.

a period of time passes, and you decide to visit it. You check it out. its changed and is different. its hardened. it got a new color to it. It's skinnier. you think and hope itll be like old times. you think you can just go back to it and pretend like the bad times never happened. So you try. You do everything like before, desperately hoping you both will connect again. 

but its harder to connect with than even before. It changed and worked on itself but you didn't. That's it you think to yourself. You have to accept it. times changed. you miss the good old days. You can't do anything but think about the times you had when it was all good.",1551466887.0

When wendy wont answer I got this other middle named bobby. Bobby's shit is usually bunk and he makes me wait at least 2 days for it. He texts me every 15 minutes saying be there in 5. Idk how but it's every 15 minutes on the dot. I think it's a computer program. He also sells random ""hotshot"" bags, an idea he got from a TV show that convinced him that ppl will think his dopes fire if ppl die from it regularly. He also killed my entire family and set fire to our house with me taped to a couch. Also he leaves what he calls ""Bobby's boobytraps"" everywhere that are just used needles full of aids blood and poison rigged to inject when someone sits on one. Also he robbed me the last 27 times I went through him. 

If he doesnt answer theres always belial. Belial is a little creepy and has a wolf head instead of a human head and lives in this cave full of red light that's super annoying to get to. His dope is fire but he always makes me bring him children and the first time I went to him I had to give him my soul. Also he makes me cut a little piece off of myself and throw it into his fire as a ""offering"". Doesnt have to be that big ya know, just a digit of a finger or earlobe. He likes me so he'll just settle for a tooth sometimes which is nice. Also I have to let him possess me sometimes and I always wake up naked covered in blood with no clue where I've been. But his shits straight lava though. Beats being dopesick.

In Georgia, the go to anti drug squad was called the Red Dogs. They were a group of special forces wannabees that were roided up with huge muscles and carried assault weapons.

They would come in with a van and usually 3 undercover cars. They would just grab people randomly, beat them and bust them. Not even close to being legal. They absolutely did not give a shit.

They worked with a supposedly undercover narcotics detective that everyone called Chinaman. He was called that because he was Chinese, maybe. No one really knew. But he sounded Chinese if you were unfortunate enough to hear his voice.

If he was talking to you,  you had a problem. Unless you thought fast, you were going to jail.

Of course, he couldn‚Äôt really be undercover because of the fact that he was Chinese and we didn‚Äôt have any Chinese junkies where I am from. Just a shitload of redneck white kids, a few black guys and me and T. And a few other characters that wandered around doing crazy shit.

But he could have been Japanese, because he sure did enough ninja stuff. He loved to hide in the bushes and see where the dope guys hid their stashes. People sold in the streets, so obviously the dope needed to be close.

T was a 100 pound redhead, and she rocked that Scottish temper. She liked to run around with her .44 magnum, which she had a permit for because her dad was the mayor of a local town.

There was a local caf√©, which was the only place for a few miles that was a retail establishment, if you don‚Äôt count liquor stores. People used to hang out there and eat, shoot the breeze, sell dope, etc.

A guy named Greg and his family owned the caf√©. He hated the police because they interfered with his business. One day, we were discussing this problem with him. He proposed a novel solution, which we thought would be kind of fun.

So what happened was that we sat in front of the caf√© in my white Acura, waiting for Chinaman to pull up. We knew it wouldn‚Äôt take long because someone would definitely snitch about the 2 white kids. The cops were not going to allow us to sit there, whether we were breaking the law or not.

Sure enough, it wasn‚Äôt 10 minutes before we saw a couple of ford sedans coming up behind us. Nobody in the hood drove a ford sedan, needless to say, because they would have looked like cops.

Now, there was a notorious ripoff artist and snitch that hung out at the cafe. People called him Cat. I don't know why. Just a stupid street name, I guess.

The general opinion was that no one would miss him when he inevitably went to prison. People were sick of his shit. The dealers hated him, the customers hated him, even the little kids on the block knew he was bad news.

Between Greg, myself and T, we thought we could probably kill two birds with one stone. The ideal situation would be to do everybody a favor and get rid of Cat, make Chinaman look like an idiot and get away ourselves, so we could do our dope in peace.

We just sat there, waiting for the cars to pull up.  A minute later, here they are.

Everybody starts to get out of their cars.

T takes a paper bag she had prepared and threw it toward Cat. He caught it. I drop a doritos bag out of my window, just for added effect.

In this particular place, any sort of handoff, any bag of any type on the street, was presumed to contain dope. Anybody in the vicinity was guilty. They were going to be roughed up, cuffed and arrested.

It was actually a true fact that just being in the area was considered to be a crime. It was called DC Six if I remember correctly. The cops would arrest you just for being alive. That's how they roll in the deep south.

Sure enough, the cops went straight for Cat, who was totally innocent but had it coming.

We pulled off laughing, leaving Chinaman in our dust and lived to fight another day.

This is, by the way, an entirely true story and actually happened.",1551458654.0

I‚Äôve been a user for 4 years and in my 4 years of opiated bliss, I can‚Äôt wrap my head around why oxy is everyones go to when compared to other opis it feels like a stimulant. Opioids are my favorite class of drugs, but oxycodone just doesn‚Äôt feel right compared to morphine based opioids. 

When I take oxycodone I take anywhere from 50-75% of my dose intranasal and the remainder orally. Nothing abnormal other than smoking the occasional mbox 30 on some foil. I find myself having opi rage more often when I dose oxy and bupe than any other opioids . What I also find strange about oxy is the warm fuzzy feeling isn‚Äôt as noticeable anymore[possibly due to tolerance being high it takes at least 45mg of oxy to get me itchy‚Ä¶ not high just itchy] I always get a similar feeling to the one when you overdo it with cocaine. It‚Äôs still enjoyable compared to other drugs but it seems to lack the most enjoyable parts of getting high on opiates. Since the 3rd or 4th time with oxy I‚Äôm unable to catch a nod. I just get hyper and a decent mood lift until something grinds my gears and opi rage takes over. I just don‚Äôt understand why it does me like that even in higher doses around 80-120 mg it still doesn‚Äôt work it‚Äôs magic like other common opioids a good example is hydrocodone other than the slower onset of taking a dose hydro orally (around 45-100mg depending on how I space my doses)it seems to get me higher than oxy.

So the pills I tried this on are 12.8mg codine to 300mg ibeprofen. The steps I follow were:

1. Left the pills whole and gently stirred them Into room temperature water

2. Poured through a coffee filter into a second cup

Now, the problem I had was while allot of the gunk did fall off, the liquid itself stayed pretty much the same colour. From the videos I've seen the liquid should be a clear almost water like consistency.

I tried refiltering and it didn't help at all.

I run out of the packs, didn't think it would be an issue like I say I run out all the time no issue. Overall I've been using for about a year maybe a couple of times a week on a lower dose of codeine.

Obviously typical opiate tolerance will play apart but aside from that one of my friends with (for now) a near non-existent opiate tolerance will snort for example 1/8 of a sub the first day, the next day when he‚Äôs coming down he‚Äôd do a 1/4 and feel it the same but stopping for a week or so ‚Äúresets‚Äù it. He also says that once you ‚Äúget to a certain level‚Äù you don‚Äôt get much higher at all and I feel that‚Äôs my experience as well

Others say tolerance doesn‚Äôt go up much unless you‚Äôre doing it for an extended period and raising your doses 

Any thoughts or comments or general knowledge on the topic? I wanna get the most out of subs in the future lol

Love, pained killers love ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Also (others online experience this as well but I‚Äôve yet to meet someone irl that relates) suboxone is the most ‚Äústimulating‚Äù of the opioids or whatevs to me, all opiates  are stimulating in their own way for me more so Han others (my first time doing heroin I didn‚Äôt quite do enough, was still pretty dang high tho in comparison to other opiates, and I was kinda edgy at certain points even drank some wine to take the edge off lol)

So does anyone else get stimulating effects from opiates and specifically suboxone? Lol I literally stayed up around 36 hours last time I did em Bc of the minor stim effects, also does anyone know why it‚Äôs more stimulating? I know it works differently in the brain but dunno specifics

It was Day 6 off fent a dope (or whatever is going around like hot cakes in my area) 

I went to the hospital last thursday to stay just long enough to induce subs. I was there like 36 hours total... anyways, i did my lost shot of dope in my car right before they called me back in the ER, had one prepped so when they called me back i slipped out to my car to grab ""my things"" and did a big ole shot and walked back to check in to ER. 

They gave me a pee test to see what all was in my system, and all i failed for was cannabis. I had taken pharmaceutical Xanax (from my friends script, as well as roxicodone and norcos late sunday, and thursday evening was when i admitted myself).

I wasnt shocked that those pharmaceuticals didnt show up because i do clear out rather quickly, but the shot of powder i was doing all week did not provide a positive for opiates. This is pretty scary because i know a lot of people who buy from this guy/girl daily, and have seen 2 people go blue doing this dope. There are even times he/she wont sell to any one because the ""testers"" said it was too strong and fell out testing, and he has to cut it more.

Well i did 16mg of bupe on day 1
Day 2 i jumped all the way down to 1, 1mg - 2mg dose. I took xanax the following day and made it 48 hours before taking another 1, 1mg dose. I did the same thing for the next 48 hours.

Now, my dumbass was dumb enough to to leave a good chunk of a bag at home before the hospital, and its been sitting here next to my supply of M30s. So i woke up today extremely depressed and decided to do a shot after 6 days off and going 48 hours on a very low dose of sub. 

I got the rush that all junkies desire, pupils pinned, and the small withdrawal symptoms (runny nose, achy legs, low back pain, depression) all disappeared. Catching even slight nod 30 minutes later. Did a pretty small shot. 
Less than (.03)

I know im an idiot for todays experiment, feel free to tell me how dumb i am for using. But what could the plug possibly be sending out to every one that isnt showing up on a UA?? 

How can i find out what this stuff actually is? A lot of people are using it. Been with this plug for 4months, never had problems with product or anything like that. Aside from track marks, i look really healthy. A lot people like this stuff because it feels really clean, but what do we know?? Just trying to figure out what is being passed around on the streets, the people i know have no plan of coming off and have all told me they got the same ""good"" shit since i last copped a week ago.

Any insight appreciated. Again i know it was dumb using again, wont hurt my feelings if you tell me so.

!!!! JUST A RANT. AM HIGH SO JUST READ WHEN YOU ARE BORED SO WHEN YOU REPLY I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN TRU THE WHOLE TEXT HERE LOL !!! THIS IS NOTHING SERIOUS ;) !!!

On a fentanyl high atm by smoking fent-mix on foil. I am thinking aka just also my fantasy/my imagination is going now :

............................................................................................................................

What if there was a compound/analoge of something or etc that was invented that when you take it it fixes your receptors and dopamine in your brain. Something an opi addicted person takes before going to sleep and then have ton put earbuds in and let an audio file play while you sleep. The audiofile is just sound or a voice or pfff, just let your imagination work on this very moment when you read this.

&#x200B;

Then when you wake up everything in your brain and body is fixed and it's again to the state from before you ever took the first opiate in your life OR even better any sort of drugs including cigs,coffee,etc.. No wd's and you feel great + thanks to that audiofile you DONT EVEN KNOW HOW AN OPIATE FEELS SO YOU CANT MISS IT OR CRAVE IT.

&#x200B;

Audiofile would be like a sort of hypno type thing shit. But the 1 thing you will know and remember is that you once were an opi or any sort of form addict. THAT you will remeber and know it's bad but you can't remember the feel of the high or the taste or the smell so you don't miss it. So when you have an operation or accident and have to take a painkiller so only as a last RESORT...and you are healed and dont need the painkiller(s) again after days or weeks you just repeat the procces with taking it so you are again fixed (opi receptors in the brain).

&#x200B;

I am just a little bored and high so just a little rant and my imagination i have atm. This i want to share lol. I know i haven't thought this thru and there will be many negatives. Just something i was and am now thinking about.

&#x200B;

Happy nods !!

Mind, I got a skin condition called neurodermatitis which causes itchy skin patches. Basically I was wondering if taking opioids in this situation would bring a relief to it, make it even worse as I heard of them causing an itching sensation or if it would just not interfere at all.

So I did some reading on the Opioid Induced Itch also called [Pruritus](https://www.opiates.com/opioid-induced-itch-pruritus/). The itching ‚Äúunder the skin‚Äù is said to mimic similar environmental allergic reactions as opiate drugs release histamine triggering the body's inflammatory response. This didn't give me an answer to my initial question, but got me thinking about the correlation to preexisting allergies. 

As allergies are also caused by histamine release, it seems intuitive that opioids make an allergy worse by releasing even more histamine in the body. But, upon a [bluelight thread](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-639968.html) I found, they can do the opposite and reduce allergy symptoms, e.g. clear up runny noses. I believe this is rather due to masking the symptoms and other effects, but one user also said they had horrible allergies that only got better after they stopped the drugs.

It basically got me wondering about some scenarios and the effect of opiate or opioid consumption in these cases.

1. How would or could opioids influence preexisting itchy skin patches?
2. How would or could opioids influence a preexisting allergy? Also not limited to like hay fever but also food allergies etc.
3. Would the allergy get better or worse after being on opioids for a long time and then stopping them?

I'm interested in your experiences and thoughts on these issues! Allergies are so common, I bet some of you guys have experience here. I'm curious.

*Disclaimer: I still can't really figure where to say opiates and where opioids, so please don't get mad if I mixed them up. What I read, opiates refers to natural (opium-) substances and opioids to semi-/synthetic ones, but I'm interested in the reaction to both.*

*Also: I kinda try to stay away from opiates/opioids (for reasons), so no, I couldn't figure the answer buy just self-experimenting.*",1551366876.0

These phones will look sort of normal, but will fold out into android tablets. Current info places the screen sizes between 7 and 8 inches. When folded, the screens will be like 5 -6"".

Samsung and Huawei have phones coming out right now, but Motorola, and several unnamed chinese companies will also have folding phones soon.

Initial pricing looks like around 2000 per phone. I know damn well you guys are not going to use your hard earned or stolen dope money for these guys, but eventually the price will drop.

Your regular new android phones for 2019 will be bigger, faster, smarter and have more memory. They will also cost more but, don't worry, you can get ripped off by the major phone companies for as little as 25.00 per month.

As an aside, a few years ago it was almost impossible to find a cell phone that cost more than 500.00. 

Now 1000 is not that uncommon. Are they just that much better?

No. They are not.

Sometimes when Im high on opiates I drink a lot, and my body just keeps craving more liquids, so much to where after a while I end up vomiting, and drink more. This has only happened a few times, but I'm guessing it has to do with being dehydrated. Anybody els crave a lot of fluids while on opiates? Is this normal. ",1551341231.0

I've gotten myself a great doctor, been seeing them for about a year now after 4 years of buying my subs myself from local connects.

**Current situation:** 

&#x200B;

I'm prescribed 2 8mg strips a day. I generally dont take anything til i'm getting up and moving for the day , or as i'm about to walk into work, etc.

When i first get my script filled I will find myself taking 3-4 throughout my day. They actually do make me feel better and more motivated getting through the busy night shift . 

I usually run out about half way through my monthly and have to buy what i need til i get to my next appointment which is just frustrating, and I know each time that i did it to myself.      ~~i'm a piece of shit~~

I really need to find a regimen and stick to it., I've thought of only taking one with me to work, i recently cut a day from my shift that links up with the one day off a week i get to give my self a 2 day break and let some of the sub run out of my system a bit. 

I also tried to set up my appointments to the ""every two weeks""  and that got me pushed to monthly appointments which screwed me even further. 

I'm worried that if I speak to my Dr. or my therapist that they will kick me out for abusing my prescription and that would really screw me right now. 

anyway thanks for reading and if you have any advice i'd really love the input ! 

**<3**

**TL;DR I basically abuse my suboxone script and i'm looking for ways to help control my usage before I get caught up with no meds or less than i should have. thanks:)**

It's been several years since I've used any opiates.

I just listened to a song that seemed to describe my relationship with opiates really well. And despite the fact that several loved ones of mine have died because of heroin, my first reaction was to want to use heroin.

I remember, years ago, hearing people say that chipping long term just isn't possible. And they're right - there's a reason I stopped, and it's because I started trying to rationalize using on Wednesdays plus weekends to use more but still avoid physical dependence. I recognized that that was addict thinking.

But when I think of heroin the thing I think about is the first time, that feeling of a warm security blanket and heroin telling me I'm safe. It makes me sad that I'll never feel that again, that feeling of perfection never comes back once it's gone.",1551328124.0

Have you ever noticed how people drive with their windows closed, even when it is 70 degrees? That is so weird.

I had an interesting experience today. I had to go to a dentist.

He fixes my tooth and tells me to take some advil, which I am fine with. Then he gives me a script for vicodin.

I tell him thanks, but I do not take opiates.

And he says, well, they are pain pills. If you are in pain, you may need them.

I say, thanks again, but it would be a waste.

That is that, but as I am driving away, I start thinking.

If you are in pain, you need pain meds.

And I am remembering the countless times I self medicated with iv heroin. I guess I was in pain. So I start wondering exactly what my pain was. Trying to pin it down exactly. Not a generalized, I didn‚Äôt feel right kind of deal.

In my case, I think it involved feeling different. From the time I was a little kid, if I didn‚Äôt know you, I saw you as a potential threat. Even if I did know you, I kept an eye on you.

To me, people were unpredictable. I would say the wrong thing and suddenly I was not cool. Oops.

As I got older, I learned how to better handle people, but I never really understood how to be social. I was still a bit hyper alert, and watched people closely to make sure I didn‚Äôt say or do anything that freaked them out.

This was exhausting. 

I suppose this must have been painful, because the minute I was exposed to heroin, I was all over it. It felt great and it insulated me from my own inability to connect.

I was cool.

Years later, I somehow figured out that heroin was like a magic trick. It sort of looked like real life, but you could tell something shifty was going on.

Heroin was a permanent barrier between me and the people that I wanted to love. I simply could not feel them while I was high.

I was out of tune. Like a human guitar. I was on a different frequency. The wrong harmonic.

This was ok when I was a kid, but eventually it got kind of bleak.

At some point, I wanted to hang out with regular humans. The internet was just not enough. My junkie friends were not enough. Life just kept rolling by.

Whatever happiness was, I definitely did not have it.

Just as bad, I was literally chained up to the dope and I could do nothing without making the required arrangements.

This all really sucked, once I thought about it. It became intolerable.

But looking at it now, I understand the truth of what this dentist said to me. Pain meds for pain. It doesn‚Äôt get any more simple than that.",1551321975.0

I call 15 min before the office closes and they tell me everyone is gone.  Tomorrow is fine. Its day 30. So it wouldnt be early nor am i trying to cheat to get it early.

I left a nice long message from there website explainijg there mistake and hopefully hear from them tomorrow morning.

Before you ask. The script is for 120. 15mg oxy hcl.

The idea of me getting it tomorrow per my orginal appointment was making me happy.

I dont abuse them. Just the anxiousness of being out and getting sick has made my stomach in nots.

Since this is clearly an administrative mistake they should take care of it right? I told them if i had the meds id still come in on the 1st for there documentation of me being there.


Edit: So i just spoke to the same man I spoke to yesterday, and he was very apologetic and kind of even started crying. He told me he saw my record and i never missed an appointment, never late, always nice. So there wouldnt be a problem.  He says the doc should have no issue filling it as long as I promise ill be there tomorrow for documentation the doc saw me since its a c2 medication. ( been going there over a year)

 I have been on 80mg/day, well, I was truly a speedball addict, all my shots for the final 2 yrs had coke.

I had an OD, and all my family discovered, sad been the junkie of the family, I got a ride to hospital and them they fucked me givin 10mg 4x/day ORALLY, so obviously the wds starts, been on hell, they tappered 800mg/day IV, with 40mg to 10mg and then put me on methadone, 10mg got to 60mg. Why they dont just detoxed morph, I was having hard wds anyway, that dose is ridicuously. 

My psichyatrist after that put me on 100mg of methadone/day, oh, I was a benzo abuser too, tappering  now with 5mg of kpins/day (didnt botthered me because in rehab they are giving me kpins).

In rehab I was tooking daily:
- 5mg kpins
- 20mg lexapro
- 450mg pregabalin
- 100mg dones 
- 300mg seroquel

Seroquel makes me sleepy all day, I hate quetiapine.

After rehab I cut off seroquel, and stop taking, my psichy put me on trazadone 50mg/day for sleep, didnt do much for me. I have no money after, loose my job, and was living with my mom, but I relapsed on coke, and crack trying a coke IV rush, but it is nothing compared. 3 days binge, I am supervised closed now because mom got me snorting coke with a rock behind. Fuck, they think I was using for months, but it was a relapse, I am supervised 24/7 today, it sucks too.

Too explain everything, I am a borderline, I cut myself often, border type depressive one, to explain my meds, today I am on psych, and psicoterapy trying to have some reason to live.

Lost my girl, and my family, I am really depressed, got one more med, 300mg bupropion/day.

And now they will tapper me from meth and kpins, some tips for me? I am really messed up, and my anxiety got to the top, how bad is the tappering?

Basically we have glial cells that sort of insulate the cells of our nervous system. It seems they also have receptors, kind of like the opiate receptors we have all heard of, except they are for the immune system. They help recognize foreign stuff in your body and get antibodies and such to attack.

It turns out that these inflammation receptors play a part in opiate dependence.

I had never heard of this before. All I knew was about the mu opioid receptors and how dopamine plays a part in drug craving and possibly paws.

Apparently that is not the whole story and more will be revealed. Here is the relevant info from r/drugnerds, contributed by

[https://www.reddit.com/user/selfless\_self](https://www.reddit.com/user/selfless_self)

The studies suggest *in addition to*  the role played by Œº-opioid receptor, TLR4 mediated inflammation is  also implicated in dependence and withdrawal, borne out by animal  studies. Ibudilast might not be a good drug to mitigate withdrawal since  it's broad spectrum but TLR4 specific drugs may also not work well  since other receptors like TLR2 might be involved. See the excerpts from  three studies below.

>Drugs  such as ibudilast and propentofylline have both neuronal and glial  effects, and it is clear that they have multiple effects. This suggests  that (+)-naloxone analogs should be considered that specifically target  TLR4 rather than having broad effects as do propentofylline and  ibudilast. (10.1016/j.tips.2009.08.002)  
>  
>Interestingly,  morphine reward and dependence/withdrawal may differ regarding TLR4  involvement. Despite broad-spectrum glial attenuators reducing  proinflammation-linked opioid dependence/withdrawal (Hutchinson et al.,  2008a; Hutchinson et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011), **TLR4 ‚àí/‚àí mice are not protected against opioid withdrawal, suggestive of a TLR4-independent mechanism** (Liu et al., 2011). (10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0684-12.2012)  
>  
>Based  on findings from a previous study that blocking TLR4 receptor by  (+)-naloxone attenuated precipitated withdrawal in rats (Hutchinson et  al., 2010), we would expect that knockout TLR4 and MyD88 would protect  mice from withdrawal. However, this was not the case, as both TLR4 KO  and MyD88 KO mice displayed similar degrees of withdrawal behavior as  their wild-type equivalent Balb/c mice. This suggests that: **firstly,  there is no question that the Œº-opioid receptor plays a critical role  in opioid dependence; secondly, in addition to TLR4, other neuroimmune  pathways are likely to contribute to opioid withdrawal.** One of  the possible candidates is the TLR2 pathway, as (+)-naloxone may block  both TLR4 and TLR2 receptors, and recent evidence suggests that morphine  can also mediate neuronal cell function through TLR2 (Li et al., 2010).

2) I went immediately from inpatient to a 90 day program which consisted of housing, a 30 day partial hospitalization program with daily group counseling and weekly individual counseling along with seeing a psychiatrist and addressing my mental health (anxiety and depression) and being prescribed proper medications (currently on wellbutrin, Zoloft, and mirtazapine for sleep) and daily AA/NA meetings... after this 30 day period the last 60 days were intensive out patient which consisted of group counseling 4 days a week, daily AA/NA meetings, and the freedom to get a job

3) after the 90 day program, I had a job, a network of people in AA/NA from attending meetings daily, a sponsor, and proper medications, so I went straight to a sober living house where we still have to go to meetings everyday and have a job to pay rent and supply ourown food... I plan on staying here somewhere between 6-12 months

I love my life so much now, and hope this can serve as a helpful aid for anyone seeking sobriety but clueless as to go about achieving that goal

Somehow I have managed to never exceed a 30mg/day (7.5ish mg per dose spread over the day and night) oxy habit for almost five years years and I can safely say my current addiction severity is exponentially worse than when I was on 30mg/day in 2015. A few factors have contributed to the anomaly of my habit, like a natural low tolerance, a lot of responsibilities, financial constraints, as well as maintaining goals, hobbies, relationships with family/friends, and hope for the future. Additionally, I actually don't find the euphoria in high doses that great as I really only feel good during the come up, as soon as I peak I just feel lethargic and look forward to coming down and resetting, so I am basically living for that 15 minute window of time. That window of time used to be many hours and I was guaranteed to have a great evening and night if I popped something as early as 4 or 5 PM, but, as the return to withdrawl has gotten faster over time, the window of euphoria has gotten smaller and smaller to the point of being a very small fraction of what it used to be.

 I have never experienced hardcore Heroin withdrawl, but the level of discomfort I am at from this mild amount of oxy is scary to me, especially when I wake up every morning in hell and can't do anything until my morning cocktail of oxy and caffeine or vyvanse depending on what I have, is in me. I can no longer get a good sleep as the withdrawl seems to wake me up earlier. So that's just what I wanted to share to maybe give a warning to people like me who thought if they didn't allow their tolerance to rise they would be able to keep the addiction at bay, sorry to say it doesn't work. Luckily I might have a real chance at getting off soon as after being broke for over a year I have spent the last 6 months building a business that I can run online from anywhere, so soon I may be able to afford to take off somewhere for a few weeks and slay the dragon.

Both were extremely underwhelming experienced and I am wondering how to achieve the best effects as not to waste my limited supply.

I was diagnosed with Sarcoidosis almost exactly a year ago and had terrible swelling and joint pain in ankles, knees, fingers, elbows, and wrists.  I was prescribed methotrexate, prednisone, and tramadol and from taking the tramadol for so long until I got my condition under control I became addicted to it. I have taken a range of 6-10 50 mg tablets of tramadol almost daily for almost a year now. I got it from alternative sources for the last 9-10 months. I managed to never take anything stronger during that time even though I had pretty easy access to it.

Things came to a head yesterday and I was confronted by by loved ones and absolutely have to stop cold turkey in order to keep my job and my family.  I rationalized my use as me needing it for my condition but fully understand and realize now I was/am addicted. I took 300 mgs about 26 hours ago and already feel absolutely terrible. Aches, sweats, chills, nausea, diarrhea, depression. 

What can I expect and how long should I expect all of this to go on as far as withdrawing? I am terrified that I almost lost my job and want more than anything to stop as I almost saw my world burn come crashing down before my eyes.

The doctor gave me nothing for my pain. So since I got currently a very low tolerance to dope I snorted about .2 and popped over the course of 2 hours 8x10mg Valium (Diazepam) and half a bar. So thats 100mg of Diazepam if you calvulate the Xanax bar into Diazepam. Feeling much better but am still in pain. So I feel good and relaxed now but my pulse is 180 to 100 and thats very high. Could that come from the benzos and dope? Feeling good is necessary right now since I was detoxing 5 days without any comfort meds. Just received 1.5gs on monday and now I still got about .7-.9 left. Received 3 samples. 1 normal dope, 1 so called OD H which is super potent and rare dark heroin. Its all super fire dope and the benzos will help me now. I can go without anything for 12 hours and still dont feel any wds. And I want it to stay like this. I will receive tomorrow 5more gs of some fire dope. I got about 20 Diazepam left so I will just consume them rather than do dope so I wont get addicted again. Also I will get some more benzos. So I for sure wont have to go through wds again and if I have tonI will at least have some comfort meds. My only problem is that I will need a driver and currently only my mom can drive me. So I have to find an excuse to go to my drop to which I can walk. But I need to find a good excuse why I am leaving again. So this wont be easy but I can do it. Wish me luck. This post got no real meaning I am just a bit pissed off that the doctor dont gave me any pain meds. So I need to find a good excuse to get out of the house again tomorrow.

This is just great. Several companies are bringing out really big screen phones this year.  The cool factor is that these guys fold in half. So you have the best of both worlds. Regular size phones for walking around, or tablet size phones when you can sit down and do your reddit.

Samsung has been leaking press releases about this concept for years. I guess they finally pulled it off.

There is the Samsung Galaxy fold. It has a 4.6 inch screen or a 7.3‚Äù display in tablet form. It will cost just under 2000.00.

You have the Huawei Mate X, which is a 6.6‚Äù phone or an 8‚Äù tablet and will sell for about 1980.00.

Yes, you heard that right. About two grand for a fucking phone.

Both phones have latest super fast processors, too much memory that you do not need and awesome cameras to take even better selfies so you can show the world your enlarged pores. They will also have 5g advanced and faster internet so you can see websites even faster than the 2 seconds it takes now. Yawn.

I am not that excited over these phones. I would love to have a 7‚Äù display, but 2 grand?

Nah.

How is it that these devices cost 400% more than a regular decent android tablet?

But you are not taking into account R & D costs, realcat.

Sure. I know. Cause Samsung execs are sooo underpaid.

Eventually prices will drop and maybe I will be able to actually see text on my goddam mobile apps. Or, I could drop dead of a heart attack first. Either way,Samsung? 2 grand?

I have to do a whole point to even feel a little high! Lame! Also, it doesn't have that good of a high, nor does it have any legs (2-4) hours tops. The ECP has 6+ hour legs.

(Suboxone advice needed),"Hello opifam, I have a somewhat rare reason for needing a sub script. I have snowballed my street suboxone use into a  serious dependency both physical and mental. While normally I would be buying oxy, codeine, and hydros to get my fix here and there all my plugs now are incredibly pricey, dodgy, inconsistent and honestly seem like narcs sometimes. So over time I've been accepting subs as payment for my goods. It was only occasional at first but somehow it ended up being something I wanted instead of my everyday meds. So I've gotten to the point to where I've paid 35 per sub tablet many times. Sometimes if I'm sick I'll offer like 15 of my 30mg addys(usually 8+a pop) for ONE single sub. 

What I'm trying to convey is that i can't afford to spend all my money on subs that hardly last me a few days. Maybe I could have had I still had my old plug whod do them for 10 sometimes less(ended up robbing me for 200 in subs) but 35? Can't do it.

I want to ask your opinion because I cant live like this anymore. The insanely high prices, the constant blowing off or getting spun for days just to get my 40 dollar sub. It's just not worth it and I cqnt keep letting these scumbags take advantage of my desperation.

The only thing that is scaring me from trying to get a script is that 1. My mom and sister work at my GP office and they can see my ORS if they want. 2. I'm currently on Gabapentin and Adderall daily as prescribed and I'd be kinda devastated to lose either one of them. 
3. I'm on Medicaid and I'm very broke at the moment so I don't know if there's any place that can take my insurance for a visit and script. 

The final question is; Given those three possible hindrances to my process of getting stable and taking my life back, what would any of you do if you were me and needed a sub script asap in order to not be fucked and have to jump from 8+mg a day to nothing but CT? Any advice is welcomed and appreciated. I don't like to cry out for help but I have half a zubsolv left and after that I have nothing. The withdrawals I've gone through(all of em many times) don't even come close to the long agonizing withdrawal I keep going into with these subs. Thanks guys.

BUT you can catch a slight buzz, a sense of wellbeing above ""normal mood"" if dosed low enough. Personally i've done this with doses around 0.25-4mg/day, but i felt the ""ceiling""/antagonistic effects starting to take over at 2mg+/day for me.

&#x200B;

I want to share my experiences and i'm curious about what experiences YOU've had. Below i'll share what i've found out by searching and testing myself (testing still ongoing and everything medically related is very individual. So your optimal dose would also have to be tested out by yourself if you're interested.). I succeeded quite well with 0.5mg/day but i was too curious how bigger doses compare so currently i find myself above the ceiling effect. Been experimenting for about a year now with the last few months on way too high doses. First 6 months was quite successful with doses below 2mg/day.

&#x200B;

\- I read about someone who experienced maximum ""buzz"" at 0.5mg/day for daily use. This person claimed he had been using this dose successfully for \~6 months with steady effect. And using the drug for a total of \~2 years.

\- I read about another person who experienced his/her optimal dose to be 1mg/day after 10 years of experience & testing.

\- Personally i managed to get nice effects between 0.25-2mg (sometimes even 4mg, but that's way too much you're just pulling the roof/ceiling-effect on you). This worked well for about 6 months, then i started trying higher doses, i felt the raise from 2mg/day to 4mg/day giving me even more of a buzz, but the ceiling-effect also came closer eventually blocking the effect. Nowadays i'm routinely using big doses just to feel well. But soon enough i'll start tapering down again and find my own sweetspot. I believe it's somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5mg for me. Splitting 4mg into 2x2mg doses each day does sometime give me a slight buzz from one of the halves. I'm sure it has to do with the fluctuation in the blood levels and the pieces not being exactly 50/50 in size resulting in one of the giving a slight buzz for a couple hours.

\- Another option of course is to use a couple days, have a break for a couple of days and it'll always work.  


EDIT: Adding what type of ""buzz"" i'm talking about, what i've managed to feel longterm using low-doses buprenorphine. It's a slight buzz similar to 30-50mg codeine/50mg tramadol (w/o tolerance). It's not much, you barely feel it. But it sure is nice!",1551214762.0

So it‚Äôs been 30 minute each way trips down to the city, to scoop this tweaker and use him for his connects for the dope boys that hangout inside this big ass corner liquor store. (Sounds corny & cliche but this liquor store is actually sweet as fuck and I know the owner is cool and lets dudes trap out of it, so more power to em) 

Obviously, when this all started out it was gravy. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. I‚Äôm copping $70-$100 worth, I‚Äôll throw him $10-$25 for some dimes or a couple stones or whatever his little heart may desire...

Over time though, the service from said middle man has declined. Steadily. More demanding, more begging, more excuses when my bags are looking short. I get it, he‚Äôs an addict too and this is what you sign up for when you go through a middle man. 

Dudes phone was shut off last week so he had to call the dope boy off of my phone and place the order that way :) 

For a whole week I‚Äôm pondering the idea of just contacting this dude on my own, completely going over the MM‚Äôs head, who in all reality is still a decent dude. 

So today was the day, after getting all my bills paid I had a nice chunk of change left to play around with and didn‚Äôt want it to go to waste, or go towards a shitty amount of dope that I‚Äôd be regretting buying 2 days later. So as I‚Äôm driving by the MM‚Äôs house, I say fuck it and call the dope boy myself. To my surprise, he‚Äôs super fucking cool about it! 

I couldn‚Äôt believe it at first, he definitely didn‚Äôt recognize my voice, and it threw him off to where I feel like he was ABOUT to hang up on me, but once I described who I normally show up with and what I drive (I‚Äôm at the spot 1-3 times weekly) he knew exactly who I was. 

Picked him up straight from his home, which we normally never do, whipped him to the corner store for a beer and a shot and got served right there in my car. Took him back to the house and we must have sat outside and bullshitted for a solid 15 minutes. Super fucking nice guy. Wasn‚Äôt even mad that I called him myself or anything. He even threw me a couple extra packs for spending what I spent today! Double score! 

So instead of blowing a lot of money and receiving half the worth of dope, on top of throwing the MM a finders fee, I‚Äôm just now arriving home with more dope than I‚Äôve ever carried on me, for what I‚Äôm considering an awesome price :D 

All because I manned up and said fuck it.

Wether that‚Äôs JJ coming through or just plain fate, I‚Äôm thankful and hoping y‚Äôall have some good news to speak of yourselves! 

Stay safe y‚Äôall, much love. 

TL;DR: normally I get raped by my MM for plugging me, decided to call the plug myself and ended up getting hooked tf up, dude was super nice and chill. Score.

av2t2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/av2t2d/precipitated_withdrawal_experiences/,6,https://redd.it/av2t2d,tylsergic,Precipitated withdrawal experiences.,"I've tried again and again to look up experiences on this and I've always failed to find people describing the moment where every bit of the opiate is stripped from the receptor by Naloxone, buprenorphine, or any other antagonists/mixed agonist-antagonist. I'll share my experiences with using buprenorphine after morphine. If anybody else has any experiences they would like to share let me know.

I've had kidney stones, I've gone through multiple drug withdrawals at the same time, and I've been morbidly depressed for a majority of my life among other things. Nothing compares to the pain of PWs. Although it may be brief I'd rather detox for days than ever go though that bullshit again. 

The first time I experienced them I was using 300-600mg of morphine IV for 3 weeks. Well the morphine was running low but I had Suboxone. So I planned to transition like I had done a million times before. Before I had always snorted my sub in small doses way after in order to avoid PWs. I never had them as long as I waited at least 12-16 hours and used small amounts of sub at a time.

I had woken up after using about 300mgs+ of IV morphine the day before. All of the fresh shots done before 7 p.m. However I had the last week's worth of cottons that I had eaten at about 9 p.m which obviously had plenty of morphine left in them because it made me pass out around 11. I slept as long as I possibly could and ended up sleeping till 4 because the withdrawals were absolutely killing me. I was sweating, vertigo, chills, aches and pains, etc.

I felt so bad I just threw 2mg in a spoon drew it up and injected in my bathroom. I never felt anything from IV sub it would just kick in sooner. I was weirded out first by and intense smell of burning hair mixed with the orange. I will remember that God awful smell the rest of my life. Then I proceeded to feel intense vertigo and dizziness that made me want to sit down. As soon as I sat down I felt a rush that was everything an opiate rush wasn't. Pure hell. Goosebumps enveloped my skin and my hair was standing straight up. The most intense chills would start at the top of my spine and roll down to the bottom bringing my arms chills with it. It felt like I was sorrounded by ice. As soon as the chills went away I would get an intense hotflash that acted in the same way as the chills. Both would interchange between chills and hot flashes. As this is going on my arms and legs feel like are being ripped apart and flailing them is the only natural reaction I can do. My head has very painful pins and needles but instead of them feeling very little and all over the place I feel like hellraisor. They just stay in the same place going in and out. A fetal position is all I can muster while swaying back and forth. These were just the physical symptoms but the mental side was just as bad if not worse.

My anxieties were racing. I felt like I was on 1g of meth and a pot of coffee while going through benzo withdrawal. My first thought was will it go away or will there be irreparable damage. This faded as everything and everyone I saw on TV I hated with a passion. My self perspective was the worst. I hated my self and started thinking of every mistake or slightly embarrassing moment with complete shame and disgust. My mind started to cycle through all these moments. Every fraction of a second something would come up. It didn't matter what time it occurred. I actually felt shame because of embarrassing things that happened when I was 8 up until the age I was of 22. They would just pop up one after another every half second like your life flashing before your eyes. It was like a day of the worst withdrawals imaginable packed into 15 minutes. The 15 minutes feels like a 2 hours. When it was over I swear I would still feel like complete and utter shit for a full 24 hours. I normally don't get the best relief from sub for the first couple of days. After PWs I would get zero relief. Idk if it's possible that this reaction can damage the receptors or what but I would feel off for 1-2 days.

I had one more experience where I was adding crystal into an Adderall reshot that had units in them while having done morphine 3 hours before. I had forgotten there was also half of a 4mg Subutex shot in it. I felt the speed then complete disaster as all that started but the mental anguish was further exasperated by the amphetamines. Needless to say I spent 20 minutes crying in a fetal position.

I've learned my lesson after these couple of times and I'll only snort buprenorphine afterwards in tiny amounts with a lot of time in between. It feels like the most unnatural thing ever. Nobodies brain chemistry is ever supposed to be that messed up. I definitely think I received trauma to a degree from it. If I smell burning hair it instantly makes me nervous. To even look at Suboxone while I'm on morphine makes me sick.
