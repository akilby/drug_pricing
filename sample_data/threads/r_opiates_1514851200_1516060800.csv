It's like once I got the first one (which was from a missed shot) my body is just prone to getting them all the time. So in the past couple of months I have had 2 from missed shots, and I've noticed something bizarre I'm wondering if anyone else has had this experience. K so of course I miss a shot and it's like sore and infected and building up for a week or two until it is 'ready'. Finally when it is I open it up and drain it (all new, sterile tools of course) and proceed to drain it every night for a couple days. On like the third day I see something black like clogging up the hole... I press and press but it is stuck it's backing things up so I end up having to grab with my other hand and pull. And out comes this black, gelatinous, substance almost like a worm, and of course the remaining infection just oozes out behind it. Once the wormy thing comes out the infection seems to come out really quickly and easily, and it seems to clear up and start to heal right after that. This has happened twice now. I'm pretty sure that the black stuff was the actual missed shot of BTH but I don't know, has this happened to anyone else?

i read up on plugging and unerstand that so all good there. just not sure about the prep of the pill. its a maroon or purple looking bad boy with 30 on one side and m in a box on the other. 

i am also curious how it will feel for me. my usual dose of oxy is 30mgs and that feels very nice three times a day. sometimes i might double the dose and that has me very very noddy like its almost too much. sometimes makes me sick to my stomach. i would probably try to ween down for a day or two to get my oxy dose down and lowered so i could enjoy the morhphine better.

When used to potentiate benzos or DXM advice varies between having it 2 hours before, to between T-0:30 and dosing, to however long before while continuing to drink it during the experience. But I can't find any conclusive information on how long this effect actually lasts, or even which chemical(s) contribute to it (naringin, naringenin, furanocoumarin... research basically says it's something to do with them but not the mechanism or how long it lasts)

7nkbpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7nkbpc/my_story/,5,https://redd.it/7nkbpc,pillsonpillsonpills,My Story,"Bored outta my mind, figured it couldn’t hurt to write something down. The following is my story with opiates. Fast forward to my senior year of high school, my best friend introduces me to roxy 30s, this is 6 years ago. I pop one, we chill at his place, didn’t feel nothing and thought it was the biggest waste of $25 and would of much rather a “dub” (this is when I was starting to get big into maryjane). My background is white upper middle class I would suggest and my friends family had a lot more money. I get my wisdom teeth out, I get a script of Perc 5s. Same day I got them out my mom gave me 3 of the perc 5s and a xanax. That was the first time I ever got high off percs and right away could tell why people got addicted and liked them. Thinking about it, my mom easily finished half the script. That was my first ever taste, I wouldn’t do oxy again until my third year in college. I had a party  for my high school graduation and that same best friend before asked if I wanted to get some roxys for my grad party And i said sure. Gave him the money, never saw him again. Was only ($50) but he just kinda threw away our 6 year friendship over some stupid petty shit. As you might be able to tell, he was in the deeper stages of addiction. Third year of college comes and one of my coworkers brings up roxy, talks about how he has a connect and he loves them. I threw college parties often and he was kinda nerdy so I would always invite him to them, he would always ask if I wanted to get roxy with him and I said yes. This is where my first ever trips to go to a dealer would begin. They’re $$30 a piece..fuckk but ok buying 2 cya later. This small but consistent dosage of 2 a week would just increase maybe to 4 a week. Idk how but I told my mom I had this roxy connect( I didn’t have him directly I had to hit up my coworker who always made me front him) I didn’t mind fronting him, I liked him, he helped me out, and he always paid back on time. This connect had roxy all the time, and I have no idea how but I never had to worry about fakes with him either. He was 24 white male. I started picking up more like 15, most were for my mom who at the time had “back pain” and back surgery so I felt like I was helping her out. And she loved me!! Of course she did right. My coworker one night gets arrested for possession of heroin. What I think he was doing was getting me to front him, he would get me pills and use his money on dope. Anyway, he gave me the connects number and the connect saw me enough to the point he was cool meeting me alone. I started slowly spending every dollar ever on them, and my mom too. My mom has a very upstanding career as well as my dad, but we were quickly spending a combined $1000 a pickup. When I started running out of money my mom would say you going to see him? “No I don’t have money for them, but if you get me 2 I’ll go” (I said 2 because this was kind of a hassle, the guy lived like 45mins-1hr away depending on traffic. My mom gave me 2 every time and that year I got the best grades I ever got. Going into ever night class every day of the week, snorted 60mg of roxy before every class and got As and Bs, first time ever in college(before I partied hard and smoked weed all the time and never went to class) but I somehow learned like a champ bc I was totally ok getting high at school and learning. Whatever it worked. I get a gf, and she’s so straight edge, never seen pot before yada yada does good in school nerd type girl. I really loved her, but kept my love for roxy a secret. Only my friends knew but all of us hanging out she started to hear stories of me snorting pills and crazy shit happening. One dAy she wanted to try some. She was TINY. 5 foot, maybe 90 pounds. I was hesitant on letting her try it  bc I was starting to learn the bad path it could lead you on. I let her know that these aren’t a joke and they’re dangerous, like probably all of us, she took on the challenge. Oh yes, the beautiful drug relationship requiem of a dream shit began. As any normal human she loved it. Started buying some with me, she would stay a lot lower in dosage tho, maybe 15mg for her when at this point I was idling around 45-60mg. The good thing about pills is that they’re so expensive it kinda limits you out. My dosage never really went beyond 60mg bc they were so expensive and couldn’t afford a more expensive habit. My gf, my mom, and I are buying pills people. I’m keeping this dealer dude in fucking business. Paying across the board $30 a pill...

One day, hm dude doesn’t answer me. Again no answer later on in the day, next thing you know, I am experiencing withdraw for the first time. Wow this is actually ass haha. Come to find out dude got arrested, and the guy who he was with narc’d on him. He gets out like in 7 days, hits me up immediately. I’m his money maker yanno. Boom, like clockwork we get this train rolling again. Maybe a few months go buy, life’s great, my mom, gf, and I are all high and happy, we’re both getting good grades, working making money...the good life. 

Again, one day no answer from dudey. Immediately I’m like ugh not again, and yes it was again. He gets arrested and I would never talk to him again even still. I only found out bc I searched and found him in the jails database. I am curious whatever happened to him and where he’s at. I no longer have a connect, withdrawals again, lil rough patch no big deal.

How fast did you guys break your new years resolution haha 

So last night a couple close friends and I had a get to gether to end the year off with good times.
Having a few beers, plenty of whiskey sours and enough bud to go around, we had a blast. Singing punk and folk songs around the camp fire, conversation filling the air. 

Starting to get a bit drunk, I decited to ask my friend if she could get me a 100mg Morphine. 
She hosted the party, and I know her mom has the motherload of medicine cabinets. 
Iv barked up this tree for years and its almost a joke now. As usual she doent comply lol

Being a bit drunk and confident, i took it upon my self to ask her mom. 
Im really close to the family and felt i could do it with out much repercussions. 

At first she was a bit shocked I even knew she had any opiates to begin with. But after a bit of sweet talking a making a shit load of popcorn she said ""ill see you inna sec"" and sent me on my way.

Out side for about 5 minutes, her mom comes out and stands away from everyone by the table. I get up and proceed to throw away my beer. 
""Come inside"" she whispered. 
I followed her into the kitchen and she explained ""I dont want to give you a 100mg because they are too strong, but I have this 30mg roxi and 30mg ir morph"" I couldint thank her enough. I offerd to pay, but she laughed and said to just wash her car...Fuckin DEAL! 

I get home and the drunk is wearing off as im preping both the roxi and morphine for IV. 
Iv never iv'd morphine but always wanted to. (I always plug) and dont think oxycodone is all that great iv unless you have alot imho. 

I figured this combo would be great since I love it so much with other ROAs
As soon as im swabbing my injection site my roomate comes home. 
Hes a opiphile aswell but doesnt iv, soo im lowkey about it. 
He brings home a half grizzy of blow. So i hold off on the nodd to enjoy some slopes with him;)

Today i wake up with a preloaded rigg 30mg of oxy and 30mg of morph. :):):)
I wake up with a ear to ear grin. 
Make coffe, take shower, play some vidya and call family. Now im ready...

Swabb site. And were off to the races. 
I push slow and steady and by time im half way through i start to feel eye pressure.
Befor i pull out the needle the pins and needles flood the lower half of my body and my legs are melting. 
Wow..... Just.. Wow
Iv never experienced a sensation like this. 
I have iv'd dilaudid and that was all a head rush with no legs. 

This, this was a new beast. 
Slowly the oxy began to take effect giving a pleasent euphoria to add but the morphine really stole the show. Great combo i might add. 

I melt in my seat, take a rip out the bole, spark a cigg and feel the eye pressure take over to a semi nodd state. 
Im in heaven. But do not take it for granted, i bask in the opiate soaked blanket that was once my skin.... Beautiful just beautiful. 

Though my tolerance was super low, and i could have enjoyed a bit stronger of a dose. All in all I enjoyed the hell out of it. Probably exactly the dose i needed since i had family dinner a few hours after and didint want to be all doped out...



Thanking the opiate gods for blessing me with this gift. These only come around so often... So thank you. 

Peace...

I really do want to quit. I know that I won't be able to until I start school tho because I just get so fucking bored when I'm sober it's miserable. I do love heroin tho, but I am just ready to make something of myself. 

I do tell myself that once I'm older, have money stacked, and kids are gone I will probably start using drugs regularly again. I mean I do really like drugs. At this point they're getting in the way of me becoming a better person, but when I die I'ma die happy and doing WTF I want lol.

I told this guy Fent was cheap. He proceeded to tell me he pays $1500 for 20 grams; this seems a bit high to me. Anyhow, dude offers me a free bag whenever I want it. I told him I’m not in the market for anything beyond my best abilities to get diacetylmorphine. Moreover, I mentioned where he might find his Fent cheaper; he explained he is delving into getting a sprayer and putting the Fent in the soluble solution (like people do with benzo powders). 
Clearly, people aren’t even bothering to make Fent scramble anymore, they are just selling it as is. It’s good because at least people don’t try to pass this shit off as #4.

I got clean one year and two months ago. I was laying on a mattress in my living room, just staring at the wall and fucking hating myself. I did a massive line of dope and realized that self-loathing never went away...it was just was hiding under an opiate haze. I had an absolute moment of clarity and realized that I was going to die if I kept going--I checked myself into rehab the next day and never looked back.

My only real point is this: Being clean actually stops fucking sucking. It was really hard for the first few months...if for no other reason than having to re-remember how to be person and talk to people about things that weren't horror stories and really fucked up drug jokes. Having feelings again was super awkward; I honestly stumbled through a period of time where I felt like a robot learning to act human. I met some great people and some terrible ones. *But* my brain settled down and it didn't feel so weird anymore. I don't think about wanting heroin at all. I have a great job, an apartment, a boyfriend and I can actually afford nice things when I want them.

I'm not here to brag, or to tell you you should get clean--do your drugs if that's what you want to do--but if you want to quit and feel like you can't, I'm here to tell you that it's totally possible. It's a new year, people are making some bullshit resolutions...but it wouldn't be the worst to follow through with getting off your DOC this year, if you feel like it's eating away at you.

And if you're going to keep getting high, FFS get some Narcan and be smart about it. I've lost *so* many good people over the past few years and this subreddit has lost even more. Nod as safely as you can and stay on this Earth longer.

So basically I'm an IV heroin and coke addict who's been in and out of recovery for the last few years. I recently got kicked out of a halfway house and cut off from my Suboxone doctor, so I thought hey I'll just take bottles of immodium until I can get back on subs in my new area to stave off my withdrawals. Well, I basically became addicted to loperomide, and I was taking about 150 of them a day, constantly fucked up from them, never got back on my sub dose, and eventually started using heroin heroin again on top of the lope. So all of this has been going on in the last few months, and between the anxiety, the lope, and heroin and cocaine I realized that I hadn't shit in AT LEAST 10 days. I couldn't even remember when the last time I shit was, but normally I'd give myself  enough time each morning to shit  before I took all my drugs for the the day but with a lot on my mind recently it  just slipped from my thoughts. Well I realized this and freaked out, started reading about bowel compaction and getting even more scared. So I told myself I wouldn't take any opiates until I got this shit out, waited a day, nothing, day 2 nothing and the anxiety is really getting up there, plus I can't eat or drink anything without throwing it back up almost immediately. Day three which was yesterday, I spent literally the whole day sitting on the toilet trying to force myself to go, and nothing. I drank a whole damn bottle of milk of magnesia, and even gave myself a fucking enema with no luck. So basically last night I said if I couldn't shit by the morning I was gonna get gloves and pull that shit out with my hand, and by this time I was three days into full blow withdrawals with piles of opiates sitting in my drawer calling my name, but I stuck to my word, and FINALLY early this morning after three entire sleepless days of withdrawals, and spending my whole New Years completely alone and freaking out I got up and sat on my toilette and over the course of an hour and a half gave birth to what had to be at least 6 pounds of shit. It was one of the most painful experiences of my life, that even dopesickness couldn't chock itself up to, but I didn't care because the amount of relief I felt after that was practically enlightening. And on top of that I had myself a nice little 3 day tolerance break, and you can bet your ass that I ran straight to my stash and banged, sniffed and smoked everything I could immediately after I took that shit, and cried from the euphoria of it all. Anyway this was my first post and I read through the rules but let me know if I did anything wrong.

Raids and heavy crackdowns in the area have made getting our usual favorite dope a pretty big hassle. Yesterday we ended up with shit that was half assed packaged and wasn't up to the normal standard. Today we hit up his makn dude and he had us come a bit further than where we usually go to him. We also had to wait a bit in a shit part of the city. He had the same stuff as yesterday which at first was disappointing but then he surprised us by handing over not 5 but 16 bundles. He explained this is what's currently going around and while he'd normally not hook us up to that extent, we'd now be getting more for our money as these bundles are less potent and have less in them than the standard. So even with that in mind , him giving us 16 instead of 5 more than made up for the drop in quality and quantity.

I got 10 more grams because I love the stuff and used to use it maybe every other night for a few hours before bed to have some fun and it stayed a non-addiction the majority of the time.

Now, after getting my hands on it after wanting it for so long, I ended up taking a small dose to feel chill at first and then every hour I kept dosing and dosing and dosing and loving how careless, social, and euphoric I was. I was eating lunch in a coffee shop with my two close friends and I was so fucked by that point one ofnthe was talking straight to me and I was looking back at them not realizing I was being talked to. 

I'm on it currently to sleep because I actually have transient pain and don't have a script for real pain meds, but I already crave more and more and know how good it feels and how amazingly it cures life's ails but I don't want to get addicted and no offense to those who use dope but I'd rather keep my use to Tianeptine and keep it recreational but I fear that I won't be able to.

I held my boyfriends glock while he was at work. I googled & found how to aim for your brain stem. Then I suddenly decided to take a nap.,"I searched and found that like idk something like 5% end up mentally retarded and vegetative instead of dead. So I made sure I knew where to aim and where to put the gun in your mouth to hit your brain stem. I fixed a noose again that I had made earlier this summer after I got out of rehab, out of an exercise band. I tied it around my neck and figured if I shot myself and didn’t die, I’d at least be unconscious enough to still hang myself. I had the gun cocked and in my mouth. 

Then I suddenly got really tired. I had spent the last 7 or so months with no job after a shitty experience making me hate what I love best. I felt like a waste of heroin money sucking life. I figured I was better off dead to everyone than the burden I can be on and finding drugs. I thought it would make my boyfriend of 5 years less stressed. He calls me from work to make sure I’m not dead, a lot of times. 

I woke up to a phone call from a man I’ve been stopping in to see since April. I went to him for a job. He came looking for me... physically drove to my boyfriends workplace to ask if I’d work for him... bc I was so depressed I wouldn’t answer my phone. I ended up going away to a 40 day rehab and missing my opportunity. I felt worthless, coming home sober and jobless. I relapsed a few weeks later. So I get this call, it’s John. He needs someone to fill in tomorrow. Can I come? It was seriously like one of those moments where you don’t know what to do but just sob.

I got on methadone the following week. I haven’t held a gun or exercise band in my hand since. My boyfriend hasn’t found paintings of nooses in my sketchbook. I hope 2018 can look 2017 in the eye and say “fuck you”.

I am coming up on a BENZO ONLY induced euphoria.,"I know this isnt the benzo sub but im active here and know many of you dabble.

So I used the last of my opiates last night, and given my abundance of benzos (no massive tolerance but been using them the last 10 days or so), I thought I would give a bit of a cocktail a go.


T - 2 hours: 20mg omeprazole (inhibits CYP3A4, enzyme that breaks down many benzos, and also great with morphine, tramadol and codeine)


T - 1 hour: 200mg cimetidine (another CYP3A4 inhibitor but also inhibits CYP2D6 so dont use this one with your opiates)


T - 30 minutes: Two double expressos.


T = 0: 200mg Tetrazepam (a rarer, weakish benzo lacking hypnotic properties but has some anxiolytic and significant muscle relaxant action)


T + 10 minutes: 0.5mg alprazolam (xanax)


T + 15 minutes: 6mg Bromazepam (The god benzo) **and** 1.25mg lorazepam.


T + 30 Minutes: Climbing body warmth and everything feels cozy, significant anxiolysis, **cognitive euphoria** (that fuzzy, penetrating euphoria you get in like the basal center of your head, which I associate strongly with opiates, not quite as wholesome but its there).

Will be sublingualling 3mg bromazepam at the predicted peak and sipping on a half shot of rum+ iced tea. Will update.

*EDIT: T + 1 hour: 3mg Bromazepam + 0.5mg alprazolam sublingual.*

*T + 1.5 hours: wow I'm feeling as good if not better than 40mg of plugged morphine (low/mild tolerance).*",1514926865.0

I'm in Day 3 (more like 3.5) of withdrawal, and I'm hurting. Mentally a wreck. In 10 days I have a refill. And I'm debating going on this week and asking for an increase in dose, potentially fucking the whole thing up.

Do I risk it? Or just suffer through. 10 days seems like a fucking eternity. I'll get a bunch then.

I know the answer. Kratom is helping. Kpins too. Sleep is easy. Xanax is great for that.

When will the withdrawals stop so I can just be ok waiting a few days?

Also, question 2. I've gone to same doctor for 2 years. Never asked for an increase. Always same dose. I am on these meds long term. Could I have an honest talk and ask for a small increase? Explain that tolerance after 2 years has taken a toll and the pain is building. I take 3x10 a day. Would asking for 4, after never asking, never missing a pee test etc, set off any red flags?

Thanks community. Just need a little help. Had to step out to my car, had a little emotional breakdown. 

TLDR - just tell me that time is gonna go quick. And is asking for a small bump in dosage after 2 years a bad thing?

So I have been using off and on for about 8 or 9 years. I have gotten clean several times, the longest being a 2-3 year stretch. This last go round I had been using opium for about 2 years before switching back to H (my DOC). I have been on the H again since September, so about 3 months now.




Here's the odd bit. I've been going through 1 g of pretty decent #4 H every 2-3 days. I have been trying to cut back so I have been doing *slighhhtttly*, and I mean just slightly smaller shots. When I do these shots I will get the rush and the nods, but the euphoria is lacking and immediatly following the rush I get a wave a of anxiety and depression that lasts about 15 min. After it fades it's business as usual. It doesn't happen when I take a proper sized shot.  This kind of thing has never happened and seems quite odd. Anyone else have experience with this?

I still look forward to sharing past tales about Cliff but I do not want to forge any new experiences. Last year I learned how is easy it was to get burned. I've come out of this year having better protected my interests but there is folly in hanging out someone like Cliff. I shouldn't have to always be on high alert when doing business with a ""friend"" in order to ensure he doesn't get one-up on me. I'd be so much better off if I just cut Cliff out of my life like so many suggest upon reading my tales.

&nbsp;

On odd weeks Cliff gets a benzo script. His hustle is to trade them up for dope. It seldom works out and in the past I used to pick up his benzo script from the pharmacy. One time he said ""would you pick it up if there was a good chance you'd have something before work?"" At the time I was nearly dope-sick so I was like hell yeah... Instead in that scenario Cliff consumed a bunch of benzos, was in and out of consciousness and mumbled through any conversations.


Most recently, I covered my ass. Bought subs and did not go through Cliff to get them because he's super unreliable for that. He did offer to get subs and I told him that's great, and that I would be happy to give him the money the minute I saw those subs in front of my face. He stopped mentining that sub connect a day later and re-focused on his hustle to get dope.

&nbsp;

Yesterday I was off from work but told Cliff I was working because I didn't want him calling my house phone or kocking on my door. He eventually texted ""text me back asap"" but none of his messages indicated why he was messaging me. Maybe I'd jump if there was a guarantee that he would give me some money he owes me but in all likelyhood he'd ask me to bike to the ATM to get his money because he's fat and lazy. 


Bottom line, I'm to run errands for him when it's 15 degrees outside. Plus there is a codependency thing going on here and it needs to be broken. I've taken steps in the right direction because I was sick of going into withdrawal. We all know that counting on Cliff's word to stay well often ends in me writing sad tales.

&nbsp;

Can I just keep avoiding him? Probably not and will have to confront him soon. I left an old MacBook at his house, I'd like to maintain pretenses long enough to get that back so for these days where I avoid him... perhaps I'll just make up a story like he usually does. ""I was sick"" or ""some bullshit came up""... 


I dunno.. I'm just glad I took steps to keep myself well and held on to my cash for my own purposes as it should be. Worst case hte old.

oral bioavailability of morphine is around 25-30% (as i know) so hwow much i need to take to feel.. you know, great?
i could sniff that, but not sure if it's possible with these pills, and IV isnt for me, yet.  
so questions are:
- is it worth the price compared to 3$ for 150mg of codeine?
- how to dose it with my low tolerance, to get this opiate happiness that a lot of people are talking abouut?
- oral or sniff?

We’ve been together since I was 16, I constantly scheme and plan and try to do everything I can to save money and get her the help she needs but to no avail.  Every night I think about her out there in the cold selling herself for a bag or a fucking rock. It makes me physically sick to think about. More than anything I just want my beautiful girl back. Everyone tells me I need to let go... everyone... they say that she’s gone, she’s a different person now, but no one ever knew her like I did. I always saw such beauty in her and now she looks like a corpse. I don’t sleep anymore because day and night I dread the phone call that I will eventually get asking me to identify her body. I refuse to give on somebody that everyone else has turned their back on, even though I often relapse when I see her. Nobody cares about her. I think I’m going to die trying to save this girl, assuming she doesn’t die first and I commit suicide because of it. ",1515079297.0

I did binge on a bunch of hydro I managed to snag for a few days a couple weeks ago and I used kratom to deal with withdrawals from that but again, it was a couple of weeks ago. My question is basically what do y’all think I should do to improve the high? Take more? Try a different ritual to avoid learned tolerance? Take a long break? I already potentiate my opes with hydroxizine, Benadryl, Tagamet, tums and sometimes grapefruit juice/tonic water with quinine, but if y’all have any other suggestions on that front I’m all ears.

rules:
1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.

no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.

no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.

no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)

For whatever reason (I guess I get sloppy sometimes no matter how careful I try to be), I've got a bunch of very small puddles and chunks of black that have melted from being small and subjected to room temperatures. It looks like I could probably salvage a shot out of it, which I'm *well aware* is desperate, ""carpet crawling"" level junkiedom, but what can I say? I'm a frugal junkie, and sometimes you find yourself in desperate times with no dope. 

So, my question to you, dear reader, is if anyone has any ideas on how I can possibly put together a shot from these disparate little bits of dope on the top of a table, I'd be much obliged (and no, scraping them off the table isn't an option, they're like little dried droplets or melted microchunks of tar). 

I've had a similar quandary with bags of tar in powder form where the sticky powder has dried all over the inside of the bag, and Im sure there's a decent little shot there somewhere, but collecting it all together into a shot has proven difficult to engineer. 

Help from any of you crafty junkies out there would be greatly appreciated.

I'm posting here because I really don't know who to talk to or where else to turn. I'm a heroin addict and have been for a few years now, I went in and out of rehab a few times and the last time I got clean I was living in a sober house. Long story short I ended up getting kicked out, and I had to move back to my old city. As this happened I also got cut off by my Suboxone doctor. I started getting sick and I remember hearing about how loperomide helped with withdrawals so I started taking it. My plan was to just take it until I could get set up with a new Suboxone doctor but I basically ended up getting addicted to immodium. I'm really scared honestly, because I don't want to be on it at all, and I know about the damage that it can do to the heart, the stomach and the body. I've been living in constant fear and anxiety because no matter what I do I can't seem to wean myself off of it. I have a few Suboxone strips but they don't seem to fully suppress the withdrawal from immodium so I always end up going back to it. I'm not getting high on it at all, I'm purely doing it to keep myself from being sick. It's been about a month since I started using it daily in large doses. I can't do this anymore. I did not come this far to die from a heart attack from fucking loperomide. I don't know what my options are, I don't know who to turn to. I have a doctor and insurance but I haven't gone to them yet because I thought maybe I could wean myself off alone. Please if anyone has any advice or has been through something similar, I need help. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to die. I just want to be clean and living my life and I'm terrified. Any help or advice at all would be helpful.  And again I'm aware of the effects this stuff will have on the body, so I'm not really looking to be scolded or made more scared than I already am. Just please help me figure out how I can get off this shit ",1515032404.0

Plan was he'd cash the check Monday and we'd square up. Well, he gets pulled over a few blocks from my house and gets taken in on a warrant from a few counties over.

Calls me again at about 3. I'm thinking, ""Jesus dude, you know what's up."" I answer anyway and he said ""get your ass outside.""

But the Oxys are just there. I regret buying them but I can't bring myself to flush them. I'm leaving the country in a few days and won't be back for a couple of months at least and will have no access while I'm away. Guess that helps me justify using them.

I did feel a little bit high after about an hour, but no come up what so ever. I know the pills weren't bunk (they're prescription) so what could it have been? Here are some variables... 

- I took them at 7pm, and I did eat something small at about 4pm... Is it possible I ate too soon? 

- I did do Kratom that day, about 9 hours before, and it was a longer lasting Kratom than usual... Could that have affected it? 

- My lowest dose IS 22.5mg, and I started with 20mg and added 5mg about 15 minutes later... Could the staggering of the dose be why I didn't feel a come up or rush? 

I'm going to try again tonight. What do you suggest? Not eating for 4 hours beforehand? Waiting longer than 9 hours after Kratom? (It would be 11 hours by the time I'm planning) Would taking the whole dose at once help?

Its okay to fail a few times, if you're failing you're trying. Just be careful with the dose when relapsing because your tolerance will be lower and shit can get dangerous.

It's been awhile since I've posted here, but since a redditor on another sub wanted to call out my post/comments about my stuggles with heroin and addiction I decided I'd check in with the people who were there for me in my time of need, who never passed judgment and who were always around to offer words of encouragement. I've been clean from heroin with the help of methadone for nearly a year now! I never thought I'd be able to say those words or even want to say them. I feel good, I'm in school full time, and I have began mending the relationships I damaged while using. That's not to say I don't ever think about it because it's a thought that creeps in daily. I just don't think it's worth it anymore. I want to start tapering off the methadone soon but I'm worried about how bad the WD is gonna be.. anyone have any experiences they'd like to share?

7nvneg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7nvneg/what_ive_learned/,29,https://redd.it/7nvneg,ClariceStarr,What I've learned,"I used to hang out on various drug related online forums that aren't around anymore. Years ago when the company I worked for changed health insurance, we were stuck with an HMO that seemed to be against young-ish patients treating chronicle pain with narcotics, so I was cut off cold turkey. I panicked, had no clue what to do. I grovelled at the feet of my doctors, begged, then got pissed and decided to figure out how to treat my own pain. I had heard about online pharmacies so I just started scouring the internet and eventually found the forums. Anyhow, that was my start of online drug communities.

So anyhow, how I came to find this place was just me missing my online friends and the comradery of the old forums. 

I quickly realized this place was different than what I was used to in an online forum geared around pharms. Here folks are doing heroin and talking about it openly. I hate to say this but being honest I had a preconceived notions about heroin addicts because I had never been around it. Society had me scared of heroin addicts and homeless people. I was even freaked out about giving folks flying signs any money because they'd have to come near me. That was before RO 

Y'all, let me tell you how being here (mostly reading, commenting occasionally and posting a couple times when I needed your insight) has done for me as a person...

I see you and by that I mean I understand you. My struggles may not be anywhere close to what you have to go thru but I get it now. I'm no longer afraid. I no longer see homelessness and/or people holding signs as something to be afraid of. Being here has truly opened my eyes and heart in such a good way 💛

I've seen so much compassion flowing around here and a general caring for each other that I've not seen before. Sure there's the occasional burst of troublemakers (trolls) but I've seen folks try to give even the most belligerent/rude folks benefit of the doubt and a chance to change their behavior. But for the most part the level of caring and helpfulness overrides the negetive that creeps in occasionally. 

Just wanted to share how being part of this community has enriched my soul.

Stay safe 💛💛

At this time i have never really done any ""hard drugs"" besides tripping on acid/ shrooms a few times. of course, i smoke weed every single day. 
So i tried this per 10 and had a good experience, i really enjoyed the high it gave me but i didn't really have a desire to do it again. 
months later, the same friend who introduced me to the perc 10, offered me to split the price with him on a blue 30mg roxy. I was nervous about trying it because its basically medical grade heroin but we still got a hold of it.
We split it in half and i broke a tiny chunk off of my half and crushed it up and snorted it. WOW. AMAZING. I LOVE THIS.
The high i got from sniffing an very small chunk of a 30mg roxy was one of the best feelings I've ever had, up there with sex, and tripping on acid/shrooms, except this shit is addicting.
fast forward a few months and here i am buying my own roxys. i went from doing a quarter of a quarter of the pill to sniffing half of it, to sniffing the whole thing, to sniffing 5 in one day, (5 was the most i did in one day) 
HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART
i have been doing at least one blue a day since august, maybe only a few sober days here and there but for the most part i have been addicted to roxys since the summer and i want to stop.
I am expecting withdrawal symptoms of course but i was wondering if anyone can predict how bad they are going to be/ how long they will last if i quit cold turkey. I spent at least $3000 on these pills and i just want to be done with them. I told myself that i would quit on jan 1st but that went out the window. I still have 4 blues left to try to taper myself off of them. anyone got any advice for me?
I cannot let my parents know about this, they are extremely closed minded and strict about me even smoking weed, so they would have a meltdown if they found out i am addicted to Roxy
I just don't want anything bad to happen to me. Thanks for reading this ramble jamble of words that describes my down falling life.i just wanna be happy without using hard drugs !

I have been taking 10mg norco for a while now. Norco is 10mg hydrocodone and 325mg acetaminophen. I take 3 to 4 per day. I know it's an issue, not here for it.

Anyway, sometimes when I can't get Norco, I will buy Oxycodone 30mg. I'll take a 4th of the pill at a time: 7.5mg oxycodone. I do get happy and high when I take them, but I notice I am not as carefree as I am with Norco. I almost WANT to be mad. I almost WANT to complain, I WANT to find things about people that are wrong in my eyes and then berate them about them. Of course, I don't do this. But this is no where near the kind of person I am. 

Sometimes when I take too much Norco, if I take one then forget and take another, taking double my dose (20mg), I do get a little irritated because I feel like I am overwhelmed with the high and I can't focus on what's going on around me, so I get flustered. This is much different than the irritability that oxycodone makes me feel. 


TLDR; Hydrocodone makes me happy while Oxycodone makes me angry. 10mg Hydro, and 7.5mg Oxy taken at a time. Anyone else experience this?

Size of problem - up to 3-400 mg per day

Duration - ~16 months

More context - on SSRIs for anxiety and depression already, so I know where I’m about to get kicked. 

Prior to quitting, I was able to switch to kratom for a month or two (or three, who knows), which is every bit as addictive. I think it should remain legal, since it’s pretty much impossible to OD on it and I’m more of a choose-your-own-adventure kinda guy, but the K advocates arguing it’s not addictive should tell that to my toilet.  Kratom is extremely addictive and withdrawals will be hell, kid (I’m talking to a kid now). 

Nonetheless, I tapered for about two weeks prior to quitting.  I officially logged Dec. 28 as Day 1 & I’m going to be clean for 2018. 

Day 1 & 2 weren’t bad, with the help of some pregbalin.

Day 3 is when shit hit the fan (& everywhere else). Despite flying myself to a beach before doing this, I didn’t crawl out of my room starting here until Day 6 (even then it’s hard). RLS was the worst and most persistent symptom. Tylenol, Xanax, and loperamide helped with the rest. 

Day 4 & 5 were the peak but same symptoms as Day 3.   Yes, I wanted to die. But you’ll get through it. My advice is to take what you need, within reason, to get past this point.  2 dose of NyQuil, OR Lyrica, OR benzos.  Just don’t mix meds that do the same thing in the same day.   I wish i had clonodine, too. Just be careful- that shit affects your heart rate and you don’t realize how much you’ve had until your hands are cold. 

Day 6 was my first day where my head almost felt normal but I was overwhelmed by the butterflies seeming to start at my belly and taking over the rest of me. Pregbalin helped a lot with this (& this is the first day where I imagined how easy it would be to have a Lyrica problem). 

Day 7 I was able to stay off the benzos & I went for a full body massage. The RLS lessened But was still bad enough to keep me up at night, to an extent.  This was the first day that beta blockers were enough to help with my anxiety. Before, they couldn’t cut through at all. 

Day 8 was more of the same but the butterflies have reduced each morning since Day 5. I went almost the entire day with nothing but knew I’d need the pregbalin to sleep. Reduced my dosage to 75 mg from a peak of ~6-900 mg. 

Day 9 was almost almost close to normal outside of the sometimes bad anxiety but I popped a 150 mg pregbalin anyway. I shouldn’t have. Not taking this shit tomorrow (it’s now Day 9).  I don’t want to trade addictions. 

The amount of crying I’ve done over television story arcs today is a testament to the amount of suppressed emotion I’ve had over the past year and change. It’s not the worst thing, by any stretch. Legs are still kicking but it’s manageable. 

I’ve worked out most days, somehow. It hasn’t helped give me any kind of relief yet but a lot of others have found it useful. It does keep my mind occupied for an hour though. 

I have not had any problems eating. I have, however, had problems keeping it in me. 


Updates::

Day 10 - So far so good. I have more moments of clarity and less anxiety. I know I’m passed the worst of it. Popped some loperamide but nothing else, so far. That may change tonight if I have trouble sleeping. I need to get off the Lyrica. It’s already stopped being effective, which I can recognize intellectually, but i can see a future where I’m popping it anyway. Besides, it’d be nice to preserve these for episodes, etc.  I have to go to a giant social thing in New Orleans, of all places, for a few days next week and even the thought of it gives me anxiety. Going to head to the beach and try to focus on the now for a bit. Main symptoms are moderate anxiety, bathroom stuff, and a lot of random emotional bursts, which have only really served to get my gf to stop returning my texts. 

Day 11 - up for two hours and haven’t eaten. Did not sleep well after my first long period of no Lyrica. RLS was moderate and more intermittent last night. Also on my first day after feeling the rush of initial moments of clarity, where the boredom of sobriety serves as an effective counterweight. Whether it’s Tylenol, or Aleve, or whatever, I just constantly want to take something to help any errant symptom. Going to go force myself to eat something small and then try to take a nap. That should help. 



Postscript From Original::

I also have zero support system. One person knows what I’m doing and she doesn’t seem much interested in the process. Hoping this writing helps myself, at the least. When I get back from the beach in a few days, I’m going to look up meetings or something. 

Happy to post updates or answer any Qs if anyone is interested. 

Answering my main question prior to starting — Day 6 was the first day I could see a light at the end of the tunnel. 

My second question was when I’d feel “normal” again. My hope is it’s Day 10. Wish me luck :)

I'm looking to start my detox from oxycodone either today or tomorrow. I've been on and off oxycodone for about a year, so I've done this a few times- not proud.

Anyway I have 1.5 Subs (the pill form). I also have xanax and kpins to help- I never take either really, just not for me.  Anyone have the best way to go about this?  My main concern is possibly having seizure and possibly ending up in the hospital. I am definitely scared about this possibility. Should I stay away from the xanax and hope I'm good with just a sub? I usually prefer the sub strips as I think the pill form sucks. Will the xanax put me at  risk?

I was thinking about most likely starting Saturday morning. Waking up, taking a quarter xanax, and see how long I could make it without a sub. Is this a bad idea? I am aware of taking subs too soon about precipitated WD but intend  to only need 12 hours for subs. Seriously just want to do this safely and ensure I don't end up having a seizure or end up in the hospital, or worse case dead.


I'm taking anywhere between 180-240mg a day to give you an idea. In the past, once I make it to day 3 I usually turn the corner and feel much much better.

I was wondering whether anyone actually ""delivers"" anymore - as in your contact will drive out to meet you (for a fee). I remember this being extremely common a decade or so ago when I was living in [major East Coast city], and although a lot of people who did this would only do it for weed and maybe ""study aids"" and things like that, I did know several folks whose boy-friend would meet them where they were as long as they got paid a little extra. I cold-copped for myself for the longest time, but a couple months ago I decided not to renew my lease (I was in the downtown [other smaller East Coast area with a huge dope market] area) and so now I've been staying further out in the suburbs and just have NO way of making it out there. I would think that there would be *some*one with a car and a bunch of free time who would be down to make a quick Ben Franklin for a 60 minute gig (it's like a 35 minute drive from the major cop spots).

Is this too late to push down? Or if you push down should you still be fine?  I almost feel like in my experience it's a 50/50 chance.  Normally if I'm willing to push it down in that scenario I am already high, so I barely notice if I register it or miss, sadly. 

I realize you've already gone through both sides of the vein. But if the syringe fills with blood as you pull out, and you push down, is there a chance it'll work? Or is it destined to fail at that point no matter what since you already poked a hole in the other side of the vein?

They said I had pnumonia and that I should come back if I didn't feel better after the antibiotics. 

I opened my eyes today and I was shivering under 6 blankets with a hoodie on. I went back in and they said I had the flue this time :(. I got prescribed some prometh/codiene tho! I started feeling better as soon as the hot little Indian doctor slid the words out of her mouth. I filled the script immediately and picked up some Sprite bottles at a gas station and some snacks.

I can't do any other drugs because I have a drug test on Tuesday for a really good job so this was a blessing. I just finished watching the new season of black mirror and I'm about to start watching planet Earth 2.

hello everyone first post been lurking daily for a few months and love the discussion/content. anyway i created this account to ask this question. i have the typical story took percs here and there from a teenager til about a year ago when my son was born. that makes me sound like a scumbag i know and i kinda am but ive been an alcoholic daily drinker since 16 and knew i couldn’t be drunk all the time with a newborn (im late 20s now btw). So I drank rarely but started taking percs more often at first, justifying that i didnt like to nod and i only like the energetic euphoric side to opiates and i wasnt addicted to them because my problem was alcohol. i still didnt think i was “fully” addicted until i tried to quit on January 1st for 30 days (no alcohol included) and only take kratom, after 2 months of both opiates everyday and alcohol almost everyday. on the 2nd (about 36 hours in) i woke up in a pool of sweat after a rough nights sleep.  yesterday was the same and i realized i was in withdrawal. today i woke up about the same but not quite as bad and was feeling optimistic. i hung out with my son and started making breakfast for my wife who was out getting groceries and felt ok, and just feeling ok made me feel happy. then she came home and freaked on me a little bit because i left her credit card in my wallet and she couldn’t pay for the groceries at checkout, which she was justified in doing but it triggered this insane manic episode in me. i turned off the eye of stove i was heating up, put the eggs and shit back in the fridge and said i was sorry and started heading upstairs and she got a little more pissed because she thought i was being a dick. i collapsed on our bed and started crying, then sobbing. i started hyperventilating and shaking and thinking about how much of a worthless pile of shit i was. what a weak pussy i was, how i couldn’t do anything right, how she didnt want to fuck me anymore and why would she im disgusting (we have sex everyday) how my son didn’t need me no one did and i should kill myself. how i never tried to accomplish any of my dreams and how i never would, and just let everyone down. how i secretly did heroin on christmas while hanging out with them, on my baby’s first christmas. and if i hadn’t i wouldn’t have enjoyed it. how the only reason i enjoyed watching a Charlie Brown christmas with my little baby and my wife was cuz i was high and that made the memory worthless anyway. i punched myself repeatedly in the head and face telling myself i wasn’t strong enough to leave a mark or protect my family (Now face covered in bruises). she tried to come upstairs and apologize even though it really had nothing to do with her or what she said. i called my guy and got him to front me five 20mg percs. 85 dollars gone before pay day. she picked them up for me, i told her she didnt have to and i could call him back and cancel. she said she was over it/me and got them. 

we talked for awhile and we’re good again. she’s asleep on the couch, baby’s asleep upstairs. i am scared for my future and don’t want to be this person, i wasn’t like this before. my baby deserves a good dad. i dont want my wife to tell them someday i killed myself or overdosed. i have now almost fully come down from the hundred millis and don’t ever wanna be in that mental state again. I need to be happy for my family, and not a fucking junkie or an alcoholic. 

For those that have stopped and powered through that depression from such, how did you do it? what did you change? or do u just have to be insanely sad for awhile and hope it goes away? maybe if i had kratom that morning it wouldnt have happened, but that would have just prolonged the inevitable right? im sorry for rambling and if this doesn’t even make sense. Im mentally exhausted and feel pathetic for making it not even 4 days in. and just to clarify I don’t think I would ever really hurt myself intentionally besides the punching thing I did today.",1515125957.0

Well, my psychiatrist has also been prescribing me TEN 5mg tablets of Diazepam every 30 days. Just to help with sleepless nights as my body rests it's pain scores in the next 30-40 days. I don't & haven't been taking it daily but today I needed it and was out of it and due for a refill.

So, my Dr called it in and I picked it up. I got home and took what I thought was a 5mg tablet because I had been having muscle spasms and needed a little sleep. However, I slept for 5hours so when I woke up I grabbed the script and checked it out. 

Turns out the pharmacy prescribed me WAYYYY more than they should have. They did THIRTY 10mg diazepam tablets!!! I was shocked. It's like Junkie Jesus is trying to drag me back into hell.

So, I called my doctor and was like, ""uhhhh yah I have way more pills than I should"" He advised I take 5 out for the month, and give the rest to my parents to give me 5 tablets every 30 days for the next 6 months. Since I now basically have a 6 month supply of it. 

The instruction now is to break them in half to make them 5mg tablets. Knowing me I'll probably make 2.5mg tablets by breaking them into 4ths.

Anyway, my dilemma now is that even though I've been honest about it with my doctor IDK if I really want my parents holding onto them. In the past, they've denied me access to medications (opiates) that I've needed and its always a fight. I don't want to get back into counting pills with them either. So, dunno.

I remember there was one guy on here from Ireland who found a bag with like 3 ounces in it.

I ordered 14g of gunpowder on the DNMs last week for $800, and when the vendor didn't ship it out before the weekend, I opened a dispute, because the world revolves around me and I found it wholly unacceptable for him not to structure his life around feeding my drug habit.

I wasn't even looking to get a refund, I was just pitching an e-tantrum because I am a dopesick brat, but a day or two after I had opened the dispute the vendor sends a message to the effect of ""I can't find your tracking number, so here's your money back.""  My dope arrived today, and it is fire.  So I got half an ounce for free by being a spoiled cunt.

Other than that, the best I can think of was when I ordered a ball of ECP from a vendor and he accidentally shipped me the same order twice.  I actually handled this one in an honorable fashion and told the vendor what happened, and I was getting ready to send him $300 for the extra dope, but before I could do it he got banned for scamming people.  So I don't feel bad about that one.

**Entry 28** - Friday, 4:58 PM

Relieved to say we survived the storage closet. Chloe, Ben, Spooner, and I made it to the nurse’s office in the detox ward. I really thought we were goners there for a minute. I was actually praying, which is not something I do. It sounded like the people were piling up outside the door, finally about to break through. Out of nowhere, we hear a lot of commotion, things breaking, lots of grunting. Slowly the noise volume got lower and lower, until all that remained was a fragile silence. 

We cracked the door open as quietly as possible. There was Ben, in all his glory, standing in the middle of the hallway. He looked at us excitedly through his messy hair. Bruised and bloodied, he fell to his knees with a metal pipe in his right hand and Spooner, unmoving, slumped over his left shoulder. 

He had seen us go into the storage closet but was busy trying to wake up the unconscious Spooner so they could come rescue us. Spooner wouldn't wake up so he just bludgeoned his way to us on his own, with Spooner in one arm and a 3ft. cast-iron pipe in the other. 

After the rescue, we began to hear more bodies coming from the stairwell so we quickly darted past the double doors into the detox ward only to find about 30 of them in the next hallway. They all stopped and slowly turned to look at us in unison. We made a dash for the first door which happened to be the nurse’s office, which is where we are now.


**Entry 29** - Friday, 5:37 PM

It feels like we will be safe for the time being. We have in front of us the strongest door in the building with double deadbolt locks and a steel reinforced window. The walls are made of cinderblocks, with tile flooring all around. So, the entry point is heavily secured and is the only way in. But, it’s also the only way out. There is no food in here, and the only water is a nearly empty water dispenser used when people take their meds.

Ben hung up a cloth behind the windows to prevent the things out there from looking in. They seem to get more agitated when they can see us. The doctor and one of the orderlies that had harassed Chloe were out there, along with Joey and a few other familiar faces. It's a mix of residents and staff, and couple people I have never seen before.

Chloe is working on getting Spooner to come to. He is hardly breathing and his lips are turning blue. We are pretty sure he overdosed.


**Entry 30** - Friday, 6:16 PM

Still in the nurse’s room. We splashed the rest of the water on Spooner’s face to try and get him to wake up, but it did nothing. We will keep trying anything we can.

It’s probably starting to get dark outside, and the emergency lights in here are beginning to dim. We have been discussing whether or not what’s going on in here is also going on out in the city.

Before he rescued us, Ben was in a room that had a window facing across the street. He said it looked like a hurricane had come through the town. Windows busted out, debris all over the street, no cars driving in the street, and no people walking around. 

What Ben had seen plus all the eerie signs in the previous few days--police/ambulance sirens, tense staff, mom not answering phone, no visitors--leads me to believe this may be going out there as well. 


**Entry 31** - Friday, 7:02 PM

Spooner is finally awake. Ben broke through the lock on the med cabinet and Chloe found narcan within it. She must not have ever had to administer narcan before because she did it Pulp Fiction style. She jabbed that damn needle in his neck and he rocketed upright, eyes wide. I told her if she ever needs to do that to me, if she’d politely stick it in my thy instead.

Once Spooner got his bearings, he started freaking out once he realized where we are. He claims the “junkies” are attracted to the opiates. That’s why they are accumulating outside, from all the opiate medication in here. He says that even if it’s in your system, they can smell it.

I write this as the bitter orange taste of the suboxone still lingers under my tongue. I couldn’t help myself after Ben opened up the med cabinet and I saw boxes upon boxes of 8mg strips. I also threw a few bottles of 1mg alprazolam in my backpack for good measure. In the midst of the situation, I didn't think this was timely to be coming off meds completely. Although, if Spooner is correct, I will come to regret that decision while the suboxone remains in my system.

Oh, and Spooner *did* overdose--on carfentanil that he had snuck in on the back of postage stamps. Which, apparently, means that it was not the Narcan that brought him out of his OD because, “Naloxone isn’t strong enough to push carfent off the receptors you idiot.”

So I guess it was just the lucky neck punch chloe delivered that shook him out of it.


**Entry 32** - Friday,  8:40 PM

From what I can see by peeking through the makeshift curtains, there are more of them amassing outside the door. It’s hard to say for sure, because the smoke doesn’t allow me to see very far, but I would guess that there are at least 40 out there. It’s clear they know we are in here. 

They all seem have similar attributes: enormously dilated pupils, rough skin covered in goosebumps, stiffly raised body hair, plenty of sweat, and an awkward  gait.

Chloe's is calling them zombies.

Spooner has dubbed them either simply “Junkies,” or, my favorite, “Stringers,” because that’s what he calls people who don't care about looking strung out.

Ben just calls them crackheads.


**Entry 33** - Friday, 10:04 PM

We are preparing to leave the room, we’ve been trapped in here for about 5 hours and the crowd outside is only getting bigger. The smoke is in the room with us now. It must be a large fire but no one has seen any flames yet. Ben is removing the tiles to the roof so we can escape that way. A few days ago, I had stolen a diagram of the building layout from Doug’s office to aid my escape. So, if we get up above the ceiling I believe I can lead us out.

I’ve packed everything that could be of use to us--a few first aid kits, some sharp tools, all kinds of meds, and a couple of granola bars. Our goal right now is to make our way to the dinning hall, so we can have food and water if we need to wait this out. Or, at worst, we can steal some car keys from one of the offices over there and get off the property all together. We are just going to have to play it by ear once we get out there and asses the situation. That is, if we make it that far.

During those 5 years I did a lot of drinking, a lot of molly, and a looot of psychedelics. I could eat a tenstrip and people would barely even be aware that I was tripping face.

Once I got back into doing blow and opiates on the regular though, I noticed that I couldn’t trip like I used to at all, and could barely even handle two tabs without taking at least a klonopin before and after. I had a series of really bad trips and only drop L a couple times a year these days.

I stopped doing blow regularly too in the past year or so cause my comedowns were getting way too harsh. I also see shadow people and get really bad brain zaps whenever I do more than like 1 cap of molly so I only do that on special occasions as well.

I know for sure that my issues with blow are a result of my lacking dopamine, but could that also be the reason why I can’t trip like I used to? I never reach that place of euphoric understanding and connection to the universe anymore. Even with benzos I still feel anxious while tripping when I do.

Update from yesterday,"A sincere thank you to everybody who offered assistance or kind words to me yesterday, it really meant a lot to me after not having anyone answer a call or text all day to have complete strangers offer to get me there by any means. Seriously, thank you.

 IM SO FED UP WITH THIS SYSTEM! So after freezing my ass off and a two and a half hour journey with no money, in 12 degree weather, i arrived at the assessment center. Ostensibly, to sign the one release THEY FORGOT TO HAVE ME SIGN DAYS AGO when i got the assessment done. Simple right? nah of course not, r/opiates knows how its goes!! Anything that can go wrong will.

 To give a little backround to set the stage, Im 24. been doing heroin since 16 but didnt get really bad until my mom died at 20. I've been through the wringer with this addiction. Rehabs,halfway houses, recovery houses, outpatients,cold turkey in jail, you know how it goes. I'm on probation right now. Anyway, I've been home from jail and living with my dad since July, got a new PO who is honestly pretty great (as far as cops go) she seems to be sympathetic to the cause and wants to help me and not lock me up. Great! The day after Xmas she calls me in. FUCK! hot urine for sure. i was high when she called me, BUT I decided to go against ALL my junkie instincts this time. i didnt run, or lie, or fake the piss test. I walked into her office and admitted that I was using and I needed help. Was expecting to go right to jail, she says you need to go get an assessment and be in rehab tomorrow.(Last wednesday)So that's what i do (prolly the 5th time ive been through the process at this assessment center) they say we will call you when we get a bed for you. Normal stuff so far. HERES WHERE THE FUCKERY BEGINS.

Last friday my dad comes in snapping ""why arent you in rehab yet"" ""youre lying"" ""you prolly never got the assessment"". So i called my insurance company to see when I would have a bed. they said ""We're just waiting on your paperwork to get faxed over from the assessment center SHOULD BE LESS THAN AN HOUR"". Well, the never sent it over and left for the weekend. My PO and My dad are flipping out thinking I'm playing games and stalling for time (not true but I understand their POV) Monday comes and they call me and tell me they messed up and forgot to have me sign some bullshit release form and to come in wednesday(yesterday) and they're very sorry for the mistake but its just as simple as I sign the paper, and the rehab would pick me up......Obviously you guys know what i went through yesterday to get there. I WAS SO HAPPY TO MAKE IT THERE against all my junkie thoughts, and shitty weather and logistical problems. I was proud. Anyway, I ask to see the woman who did my assessment but she refused to see me and had me sign the paper at the front desk. Weird but w.e. I sign the paper and ask when i can expect the rehab to pick me up. She gives me a side eyed look and closes the partition in my face and eventually sends out some other lady who said ""we're sorry but they no longer have a bed for you BECAUSE YOU TOOK TO LONG!!!"" (I'm mildly dopesick at this point and exhausted) I kinda snapped a little and asked for the supervisor or whoever was in charge and sat my ass down, explained the situation and told him I wasn't going to leave unless it was to the rehab lol Had him call My PO and my Dad and explain that I'm doing everything humanly possible to do the right thing and THEY were the ones causing the delays and bullshit. and that if they did what they were supposed to, that i would have gotten into rehab a week ago....Eventually They tell me to go home and they'll call me when the next bed opens up..... So I went home, now fully dopesick... AND WAKE UP THIS MORNING TO SIX INCHES OF SNOW AND NO UPDATE ABOUT REHAB. This got way longer than i wanted it to be but i just had to get it off my chest. IM SO FUCKING FRUSTRATED IVE BEEN FUCKING BEGGING FOR HELP, DOING WHATEVER THE FUCK IT TAKES. they've wasted a fucking week of my life, almost my freedom, a full fucking trek through the artic blast. AND treated me like someone who doesnt matter, who doesn't deserve respect. IM SICK OF GETTING JERKED AROUND BY THESE PEOPLE.

 ""(hEy KeNZo MaYbE YOu ShOULdnT bE A DoPEfIEnD tHeN YoU DoNT hAVe To DeaL WiTH tHIs) ""... Fair point. This situation is 100% my fault, I relapsed, THAT is the root cause of all of this bullshit. I take full responsibility for that. Accepted the consequences, and made the effort to get help. My point is, WHEN SOMEONE BEGS FOR HELP, WHEN ITS FUCKING LIFE OR DEATH. and I PROMISE you it is very much life or death for me right now, the system NEEDS to be better than this. I feel like im in the twilight zone! My dboy never gave me the run around for 8 fucking days, but my county did. I know i sound like a whiny bitch and that this is an absurdly long rant at this point, but this is my life. And if i fucking die before I get help, nobody will lose their job or even bat an eye, or remember my fucking name. WE DESERVE BETTER. I love you guys, thanks for the support.

The events I'm about to describe happened several days ago now, but the effects still have me in a much worse position than before. How I lost my cash and product is going to sound pretty fucking insane and astronomical in its occurance, but that's only because it is. Still 100% bitter, still no chance of getting any of it back from that tweaker ass hoe.

So basically I was runnin around in the skanky city just over the highway doin my thing. At this point I have a horrible predisposition to this city, definitely experienced more trauma than wonder here. It's notorious for immense trap houses and car thievery. Like everyone there is a car thief and there was this big multi-car-jacking case like 9-10 months ago that my homies were involved with and it was fucking nuts, so I'm considering telling that one from for the most part an outside perspective, we'll see. Anyway. I was just going to trap houses, going to people's houses, meeting at 7/11, selling meth, making calls, getting people in touch so I didn't have to do the work, making trades, etc etc. It was very busy at this point, and I was powering through with no sleep on the past 60 hours and maybe 700 calories. I was very light headed, my lips and hands kept going kinda numb, and at one point I thought it safe to assume I was going to pass out. Before going into a trap house I made the connection that these people don't give a singular fuck about me, just my drugs. That's fine by me, but if I do have the misfortune of passing out then these goons are going to run my pockets and throw me out the door. So I stuff my cash and my product in my sock. I've never done this before in my life, but I've seen plenty of people do it. So I go about my excursions and don't pass out. 

After a couple hours I get a text and am being invited to dinner by this family I know. I mainly know the daughter and her cousin who's in town for holiday, her cousin and I go way back and she's leaving town tomorrow. I would like to see her and a change of environment is always nice. So here's the thing about this family... they're like a house whose frame is rotted. Looks great when you're walking up to the door step, step inside still wonderful, but so much as dig a measly fingerpoke in the wall and you see the rot and smell the stench of what it really is. At first glance they look drug free, middle class and happy, but look longer than a first glance can hold and their facade crumbles, and they get angry about it. It's kind of heart breaking honestly. The reality and truth of it is that they all do hella meth, their actions and reactions are entirely based on off the wall, unstable emotions and a construed sense of instinct. They are entirely unstable and unpredictable which can often lead to pointless arguments getting physical. There are two boys who the youngest, the rest are girls. With that context laid out, naturally it's one of those houses where you have to take your shoes off and shit, even though they have hard wood floors so wtf? Not gonna get into that. 

I walk in, hug people, talk loudly to greet whoever isn't in the entry way, and take my shoes off. Well oh fuck wait there's a wad of cash and a bunch of fucking meth sticking out of my sock like the best tumor you could ask for. I have one arm that I can use efficiently and people looking at me, so as subtly as I could I slip those valuable into my shoe while I'm bent down taking them off and moving them, my pocket would have been much too obvious. So we get to the table, eating and bullshitting, mom is runnin around being a Flail-Bot 3000, she's fuckin everywhere clearly gacked out of her mind. Whatever though it's dinner, what do you expect? She leaves the dining room a few times, her constant changing of locations and tasks to not fully complete are beginning to be a background focus to the rest of us. About 45 minutes we hear her call to us from the entry way, she informs she has to go to a bumfuck city in a different county and it's a little over an hour away. It's about 10 at night and she suddenly needs to go this fucking instant. Before anyone even has a chance to respond we hear the door shut and she's in her car. Uuuuuhhhhh. Okay. Right. Sure. What the fuck? 

Now I know this is a fatty wall of text, and I promise I'm sober as I'm writing this, but up in the beginning I used the phrase, ""astromical in occurance."" This is what I mean. The rest of us begin brainstorming/joking about why she would have to leave so suddenly and to that place. The daughter I know best says, ""maybe she found a spider when she was doing her shaking and didn't want to walk past it, so she turned around and went out the door."" I don't know what the hell that means so I ask for elaboration. It turns out when momma gets gacked she starts shaking people's jackets and shoes for fucking spiders. Not even kidding. She doesn't want any in the house and goes to extreme efforts to make sure it is that way. She shakes people's shoes for spiders. I fucking repeat, SHE SHAKES PEOPLE'S SHOES FOR SPIDERS. THAT'S WHERE MY GOD DAMN MONEY AND METH IS. My cash and my Meth is quite literally my lifeline, you can't fuck with that, but she took it all and dipped. I don't even know if I believe what I was told, maybe she knew I had something in my shoe, I don't know, but my god what an unlikely misfortune. Like are you fucking kidding me with that. Yes, it all should have been on my person, that's on me, but this consequence is just overkill. Lesson learned I suppose. She actually has yet to come back to town is what I've been told. I've driven by a few times and her car is never there. 

So yeah there's the spider story. For those who were present for the conversation in which this story was requested, I'm happy to share that my Favorite Lesbian Tweaker Duo is in fact together again, they just needed an adjustment of living arrangement. Which they got. 3 times in one day actually, I didn't help unpack at the new living quarters at the end of the day because at that point it was just excessive.",1515092742.0

These aren't days in a row, but just different days.) 

Day 1: Take Kratom at 9am, wait 8 hours, take five 5mg Hydro. Feel nothing. I assume I didn't wait long enough. 

Day 2 AND 3: Take Kratom at 9am, but instead wait 10 hours. Take five 5mg hydro's. Works perfectly. 

Day 4: Take Kratom at 9am, wait 9 hours, take two and a half 10mg hydro's, feel nothing.

Day 5: Same thing as Day 4. 

So clearly there is SOME antagonist effect of Kratom, but what exactly can I do tonight if I am planning on using the same dose of Hydrocodone, but I took Kratom this morning? Should I wait longer? Is there anything I can do to clear out the antagonists and lower my tolerance? (Magnesium, tumeric, tagament, etc.) 

Should I add a potentiater to the hydrocodone? Should I try crushing up the 10mg hydro's? Should I try fasting before taking the hydro? 

I realize Kratom has antagonists, but as you can see on Day 2 and 3 the hydro worked fine and I took the kratom in the morning, but I took 5mg tablets instead of 10mg ones. So could that have something to do with it? 

Is there ANYTHING I can do to get rid of the Kratom in my system for when I plan to take my hydro tonight?

I went on this big oxy binge last year in like october-november, for like almost 30 days i bought at least one Roxi 30 and just straight ate it no snorting no bullshit. but towards the end i’d buy like 2 cause one was still getting me high but not high enough. and towards the very very end i’d buy half an OP 80 just to not be sick for the whole day which would also somehow get me high. at this point i had final projects and shit so i wasn’t too worried about catching big nods and stuff like that cause i had shit to do also. 

But at the end the roxi man ran out and i literally had to stop cold turkey against my will. So for like 4 days i kept throwing up bile (i’m assuming it’s bile or stomach acid it was yellow) and i was dry heaving like a motherfucker nonstop. Also i felt like it would never stop. I had cold sweats and I would be hot and cold at the same time.

Thankfully my girl took care of me or i might have tried to jump out my window but this shit was so fucking painful. There was like a long rectangle down the front of my stomach that also would not stop hurting and i could barely stop breathing fast and shallow the whole time, it felt like i could never catch my breath. When i went to take a shit it was damn near liquid each time. I couldn’t even keep down water and I didn’t feel like eating shit. but the MOST confusing part is that I didn’t think eating a roxi would fix anything, if anything i thought i’d probably yak that up too. 

So my question to you fellas is, how the fuck do i know this was withdrawals or not? Was that just some fucking Flu? Have I still not experienced withdrawals? What the fuck could possibly be worse than that? Just give it to me straight , doc.. 

Naw fr tho that was fucking tough but I can rest 100x easier knowing that that’s what withdrawals are and that I’ve already experienced them. Cause i’m the type of dude who if he does it once, he can do it again and if that’s all they are then might as well go OD as fuck on the oxy’s next semester lol. ",1515090053.0

I know over the past year I’ve been on and off posting harm reduction questions that concerned a lot of you. I just wanted to start this by saying I’m tapering down on Bupe to hopefully leave me 4 year stint of On and off opioid abuse behind me.

THAT BEING SAID (here comes the concerning question) I’ve been in Italy with my family for the past few weeks visiting extended family. About a week into the trip my anxiety can back in full swing and began spiraling out of control. So basically I’ve been taking low dose (.1-.5) of benzo (lorazepam). 


[skip to here]
Today I found a small piece of a quarter bar and took it with my subutex. That was about 3 hours ago. Now I’m in a van with my family and I’m feeling like I’m hyperventilating, getting light headed, my breaths are shorter, and of course, panic attacks. Is it possibly with someone with a high tolerance to subs (10mg for 4 months, 8mg for 6 month’s daily) could get respiratory depression from adding that low of a dose of Xanax? I also did smoke a few cigarettes before getting in the van so that might have something to do with it. 

Basically I’m wondering if there’s a good way to monitor my respiration. I don’t want to make my family pull off and go to a hospital if it isn’t 100% necessary. Thank you guys, hope everything’s well.

Fucked off and got a felony, along with losing my license, and now I'm 37, nothing to my name, living with my homie and his mama, in life stasis.  This life is typical Norman Rockwell routine and it drives me fn nuts!

I do roofing, but work is slow and oxy is above $1mg, so I never get to satisfy my drug urges.  I see this whole fentanyl issue and know that even if i found dope, I'd be scared to try it, plus I hope I wouldn't put my family thru dope issues.

7ogvkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7ogvkc/yifu_by_nodding_out_way_too_hard/,9,https://redd.it/7ogvkc,DTTOH,YIFU by nodding out way too hard :(,"I haven't been frequenting this sub very much lately, but I just had to share this awful story. 

So I was feeling especially self-destructive and decided that it would be a good idea to do a whole gram of decent ECP in an evening. I insufflate, so it was spread out over a couple of hours as that is quite a lot of powder to get up in me. My tolerance is pretty shot, so it takes me quite a lot to feel anything beyond getting well, and it's a delicate thing where it's hard for me to not overshoot the sweet spot of euphoria and just nod the fuck out. Needless to say, I did just that this evening. 

For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea to do the dishes. I start running the water, waiting for it to heat up before I fill the sink, and that's when I nod into total oblivion. Unfortunately, there was a cereal bowl in the sink completely covering the drain. I'm sure you can see where this is going. 

I have no idea how long I was out, but I wake up (still standing right in front of the sink like a fucking retard) to a sink full of water running like a waterfall off the countertop. As I start to come to, I realize that there's about a half inch of water on the kitchen floor. I live in a one bedroom apartment, so I realize that I have flooded almost the whole living area too. 

I freak. the. fuck. out. 

Start running around grabbing every towel in the house. I get down on the floor using towels like squeegees, just trying to corral all the water into the kitchen, where it's tiled instead of the parquet flooring in the living area. I line up towels like dykes at the two doors of the kitchen. As I start getting the water off the floor and wringing towels out into the sink, I realize that all the cutlery and kitchen tool drawers have filled up with water completely. I'm absolutely hysterical at this point. I have to empty the drawers of their contents, bail some water out so I can get them off their tracks without dumping litres more water on the floor. I think I dropped a bunch of cutlery, which woke up my (sober) girlfriend. She was not impressed. I told her I started filling the sink and then fell asleep on the toilet. She would kill me if she knew I was standing right there the whole time nodded out. 

It took me over an hour to get all the water off the floor. Then I had to wash everything that was in all the drawers, hang up all the towels, and run them through the laundry the next day. The wooden drawers have swollen considerably, so they're insanely stiff now. I feel like such a fucking pathetic piece of shit, I swear I almost jumped off my balcony when I realized what I had done. 

The one silver lining, that I honestly can not fucking believe, is that it seems that I didn't flood my downstairs neighbour's apartment. I simply do not understand how that didn't happen. There was water running for at least an hour (no idea how long exactly, this happened in the middle of the night too) on the tile and parquet floor, I thought FOR SURE I was going to be completely fucked when my neighbour / management realized what happened. I guess it's possible that they are away for the holidays and I'm going to get a rude awakening in a few days when they get back, but so far so good. It would have been hard to deny any wrongdoing if maintenance knocked on my door at 8am the next morning to see a thousand soaked towels hanging to dry all over the apartment. Now the only evidence is my stiff, swollen drawers. 

Holy shit, do I ever feel fucking terrible. I've fucked up a lot in the last 3-4 years that I've been an addict, but this is big. I'm barely affording life right now (not just due to use, getting fucked over for hours at my work since it's the winter), so if I were to get slapped with a few grand of damages to the apartment building I'd probably just off myself.

Since I started using Kratom twice a day, I have found that whenever I use hydrocodone, I can not feel the hyrocodone. 

I assumed this was because Kratom obviously raises tolerance with an agonist effect, but further reading came across a big debate on whether or not it also had an antagonist effect. This intrigued me, so I did a test... Well, a few. Here they are! These are not consecutive days, and I hope someone finds this info useful.

Please note: in all these days I drank a lot of water with the Kratom and Opiates, ALWAYS do this. Never forget to drink water. I also drank a coke with the DOC on Day 2 and 5, so that may have something to do with it! 

Day 1: I took 4 grams of Red Bali at 10am and waited until 7pm that day, and took 25mg of Hydrocodone. I felt NOTHING. I still assumed it was my tolerance. 

Day 2: I took 4 grams of Red Bali at this time 8am and waited until 7pm again, this time, not eating after 3 oclock until 7pm, and taking magnesium oxide twice that day, as long as vitamin C. I took 25mg of hydrocodone, and BOOM! IT WORKED! Not very much, but it worked. 

Day 3: I woke up late this day, so I had to take Kratom at 11am. 6 grams this time due to a very bad headache. I took magnesium, did not eat after 3, and also took vitamin C, but strangely enough I did not feel a thing... 

Day 4: It was about the same thing as Day 3. Except this time, I added 2 grams of maeng da, and I took the Kratom at 10am thinking if I left at least 9 hours, it should have an effect. I took the magnesium, vitamin C, but again felt absolutely nothing. 

Day 5: This time I decided to push the Kratom earlier, and took Kratom at 7am. I took magnesium, vitamin C, and didn't eat after 3. At 7pm (well, actually, this is tonight!) I took, again, 25 mg of hydrocodone, and felt it perfectly!!!

These weren't consecutive days, and I'm sure the kratom and hydrocodone would work TOGETHER, but if this is useful to anyone, I definitely found that once the Kratom (Red Bali) wears off, there is still a bit of an antagonist effect until around 10-12 hours after you take it. I am not sure what causes this, and am not sure if it is like this for everyone... 

So what is your experience? I know there is a lot out there, but it's hard to find multiple days testing like this. So if you are wondering why you can't feel your DOC after 9 hours, try waiting 2 more hours!! That might help :) 

Peace and be safe

I wanted to find out what it feels like to be a *real* junkie.  Being a long time denizen of this sub, I think I know how to do it, in theory.  

Anyway, I microwaved 1 mL of water to boiling and dissolved half a strip of suboxone in 0.4 mL.  After everything dissolved, I slapped my arm until the vein (cephalic vein?) popped up.  Stab one: damn it hurts!  Pushed and pulled the needle but couldn't register no matter what.  A tiny drop of blood appeared after I withdrew.  After waiting for the bleeding to stop, stab two.  Ouch.  But this time, I felt a 'pop' after pushing the needle in about 1/4 of an inch, and bingo!  I pulled back and blood filled the barrel and mixed with the orangey color of the suboxone.  I pushed the plunger down -- no resistance.  I withdrew the needle and blood immediately started gushing out.  Made a mess on my pants, oh well.

I started feeling lightheaded and opiatey pretty fast (within a minute), but it was underwhelming.  Totally not worth stabbing myself twice for.  I now have more respect for nurses who do without making it hurt so much.  Does it ever get better with time/experience?

Been in treatment for 10+ years, but nothing ever really worked. I grew tired of it and wanted ti end it.

I never had any opiate before 2017 except for one time trying smoking opium in Laos (that was the 2nd best sleep I ever got). I did an extensive research about commiting suicide that wouldn't cripple you if you fucked it up (thus no guns or jumping under a train). My final options were: fentanyl, propofol, pentobarbital, sodium thiopental or asphyxiation in atmosphere of nitrogen/helium/argon/carbon monoxide (anything but carbod dioxide - it's painful).

In April 2017 I ordered 2g furanylfentanyl from darknetmarkets. I received 2g of furanylfentanyl and 2g of 1:10 furanylfentanyl:manitol  (not sure why the vendor added the diluted furanylfentanyl).

I had a two suicide attempts, which made me black out for 3-4 hours, but breathing didn't stop.  But I knew I needed to push myself more to get it done. So I decided to myself addicted to ""corner myself"" so that suicide was only option.

I got addicted after 18 days starting in October (at first I used just once a day, then twice...peaking maybe at 8 times a day). After those 18 days I woke up with first major withdrawal, all burning up and feeling thousands of needles pinching everywhere. Tried to OD several times, with largest dose of >= 500 mg furanylfentanyl orally (estimated 10-30x fatal dose based on LD_50 of chimpanzes) + I snorted bunch to go with that. Every time I OD'd I blacked out for 3-4 hours, but breathing never stopped.

The only really unexpected thing was something I experienced in the major withdrawals twice - I'd call it **""god's light""** (I'm not religious by the way, but I had ""god delusions"" before because of my paranoid schizphrenia + bipolar disorder). First it appeared after those 18 days when first major withdrawal appeared. It ""told"" me that the suicide won't work. By ""told"" I mean a thought appeared in mind that I knew it was true. But I thought that those were just those god delusions (not sure what it actually was but fact is that I couldn't die).

Second time it appeared when I started the get-clean withdrawal. It lasted maybe for 8 hours. Everything was immensely white and colorful and beautiful, I could hear every molecule of water boiling in kettle...all while in staggering pain and feeling that holes were forming in my bones.

I've had all kinds of psychedelics many times before (LSD, MDMA, psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ...) but I never before saw anything like that. It was like really strong really painful trip. It was actually kind of fun while it lasted despite the pain. After the ""god's light"" subsided, it was just pain (+ all the other symptoms like diarrhea, throwing up/dry heaving until I couldn't breathe, sweating...). I tried to sleep which was a mistake because instead of sleep my thoughts got twisted and lost. I tried to fight it for several hours, but it broke me.

Then I sent a friend to a doctor with whom I made an arrangement before that he'd prescribe suboxone. It took 3 hours for him to get there and back, which was like half an eternity. Then, as I said, it took the 8 mg suboxone 12 hours to work. After 3 hours I was at least in a little bit less pain. But before that if I had any opiate (even heroin) I'd do it just to stop the pain.

After another 8 hours the suboxone slowly wore off and I was again in full withdrawal. This time I noticed that if I was talking or doing anything and was fully focused on it, the pain was brutal, but I could hold it on a level that was manageable. So for the next 30 hours I was doing anything to keep occupied (reading, writing journal, watching videos, sorting old memories). I was astonished how many things from over 20 years ago I could remember.

That was the worst phase, then it took a few more days of shitting water and some vertigo (but the world was spinning so fast...). At least I lost some weight :)",1515196324.0

Shit went south when I overcame my needle phobia and I OD'd twice on dope/benzos in 2016 as well as a coke overdose-almost-stroke type deal in early 2017.

Well I reached my breaking point this summer. I went to detox and inpatient rehab later. I'm currently in a sober living facility which is going pretty well, I've also found a satisfactory career. It gives me something to which I can work towards.

As of today, I've been completely sober for six months (not counting detox because I was on a taper). I wish y'all the best of luck. I don't wanna sound like a hallmark card but it doesn't have to be like this, this strung out shit is for the birds. Sober live has a lot to offer once you brave the first few weeks and even after the pink cloud comes crashing down.

For example I got money for random stuff now! I splurged on PC parts and I'm currently saving up for a flight to the US to visit my friends over there. It feels good to be independent, I no longer am at my dealer's mercy nor do I have to panhandle/shoplift/resort to other grimy shit.

Anyone looking to get clean, here's what I've observed:

- Don't overwhelm yourself. There's no need to become swole, fuck Emma Roberts, read Joyce and Pynchon and Heidegger, found your own religion, or do any other outrageous stuff within one week of achieving sobriety. Set small, attainable goals and work towards them. This is easier said than done and if you feel depression is encroaching upon your problem-solving abilities, see a psychiatrist.

- Reward yourself. Shooting dope is Russian Roulette, especially nowadays, and you made it out! So do stuff that is fun to you and feel out different hobbies.

- Surround yourself with others willing to stay sober or normoids. This is essential, because loneliness often leads to boredom which leads to intrusive thoughts which leads to relapse. That was my experience during previous attempts at sobriety. I use every chance I get to socialize, support groups, therapists, work outings, etc. If you have to force yourself to do that stuff, DO IT!

I didn't want to sound like a Hallmark Card, but at the end sobriety is all about having some greater goal that you value more than Heroin. So stumble through the world wide-eyed like a kid, find your calling and put the plan in motion. If I can get sober, literally everyone can.

Best of luck to y'all, sober or not!",1515194717.0

So I’ve always been a lurker since I discovered this community of people supporting each other. So I had been smoking weed for ibs for a long time pretty much all day. When I don’t smoke I throw up and have cramps. One day I found kratom and it was like I didn’t have ibs anymore. It allowed me to take a t break for a drug test which would have been impossible without it. But I never stopped taking it when I started smoking again. Now I’m just spending too much money and kratom is potentially going to become a banned substance while weed is on its way legal in my state so I’m quitting. I was dosing WAY too often. Pretty much every two hours. I want to say I hope you guys don’t think I think this is as severe as withdrawing  from a serious opiate habit but combined with the return of my ibs and general anxiety (I have general anxiety disorder) symptoms I think it’s gonna be bad. If I don’t dose after 2 hours I get cravings and start to get cramps and anxiety. 

I haven’t taken it for 6 hours now and I can feel diarrhea happening and I’m getting really annoying restless legs. I’m basically just smoking a ton of weed but I also have gabapentin prescribed (for the anxiety disorder). Does anyone know how much of this I can safely take in a night? I’m not trying to get high but I want to hit the restless legs if I can. Any help is appreciated sorry if this is a mess. I have a very frantic feeling haha 

I respect all of you so much and I always have but I now even more so. I can’t imagine what really bad withdrawals feel like. I know mine will get worse but even so I can’t imagine this is all people who have bad opiate habits feel.

Luckily came across a friend who’s gonna sell each of his for a low price.

Today is day 1 & I KNOW that’s not really shit but I genuinely feel like for the first time in years I am thinking more clearly. I showered, I swept, I did my laundry. All without a drug.

Long story short, I stole a pricey tablet convertible from work. It was actually a defective unit that is supposed to be sent back to the manufacturer but I thought what a shame if it's easily repairable at home, which it is.

The first day I felt a little paranoid but day two my heart was racing before bed.

&nbsp;

Now I don't even need the deice. I don't plan on selling it. Perhaps I'd buy something just like it if I didn't have so little excess cash to be spent on such things. Hard to save money when getting material for Cliffposts :p

&nbsp;

So I took it home because other people disappear with shit like this, why can't I? Aside from paranoia from repercussions of my actions if caught there is one more concern.

My immediate supervisors put up with my shit because I'm a good worker who comes in for my scheduled shifts. They mainly tolerate my frequent late arrivals for my shifts.

&nbsp;

My logic is that if my supervisors put up with me and haven't fired me yet.. I shouldn't pay them back by creating issues for them. Once this device is noticed to be missing it's a $900+ hit for the department. 

It could jeopardize my supervisor's job or advancement. They don't deserve that... **I think I've made my decision while writing this. I'm bringing it back once and for all tonight.**

*nbsp;

At the beginning of the post I wasn't certain and was fishing for advice and recommendations. Maybe looking for someone to compel me to just keep it. One person might say ""you already have it in your home"" but that fact does not mean that my supervisors wont get hell for it.

Is it possible that I for some reason have a crazy high tolerance for a starter? I mean, I did just sniff 8mg when I read that 2mg and 4mg is recommended as a starter dose! My friend just eats them (even though it's only 35% bioavailibility when eaten, just following doctor's orders) and he says he gets a pretty nice high from it.

Anyway, as all shitty stories start out “...so I met this guy....” and it’s true. Started talking to someone on here and fell for him like I’ve never experienced before... through an (old) marriage and plenty of other stuff... never has been like this. He claimed the same on his end. 

Anyway, as of a few months ago I was a half intelligent person working and finishing my training in medicine and parenting my kids and just living. Then I started having trouble with an infection in the hardware in my leg from an old injury. Got seriously ill and septic and ended up hospitalized a bunch. Odd being constantly on the other end of treatment . Here’s where the story goes bad...

I left the hospital against medical advice because I had to move... was going to return to the hospital that night but I just had some stuff to take care of that couldn’t wait. Good plan and all but like 2 hrs after leaving the hospital I got arrested on a bench warrant for missing court (for being in the hospital and they didn’t send the notice until after I was already hospitalized so I don’t know). Anyway long story short the judge was a dick and decided to make an example of me and threw me in jail. I remained there for two months trying to straighten it all out. While there I had no way to contact ANYONE except my ex husband since I had to know peoples numbers by memory and I don’t memorize anyone’s numbers anymore. So I had literally no way to contact him. 

I spent the entire 64 days freaking out because I know he was assuming I was dead since the last I spoke to him I was sooo sick. If there would have been any way to get a message to him I would have. I don’t know if all jails are like my county but there were zero options. I was beyond sad, worried, anxious... there isn’t even a word to describe it. Longest 64 days of my life... not because I was in jail but because I couldn’t contact him. 

Upon release literally the first thing I did... before I even had a chance to talk to my kids, etc, I reached out to him. Explained (or attempted to) the situation.  No response for a few days. Made me feel like an ass since those few days were torture and I know I put him thru that for two months. Finally he responded and basically told me to fuck off because I put him through hell in the time I was gone and I should have contacted him. Ouch, but I get it I guess. Several days later we talked and it was actually pretty good again, and then he just stopped responding. Clearly making a point, I get that. 

So here I am, like a dick head, still wishing every time I get a text that it will be him. It never is. Obviously he’s telling me he’s moved on and so should I but ITS NOT THAT EASY! I understand that I hurt him but I feel like I deserve maybe a little understanding that there was NOTHING I could do and that I’m equally as hurt. 

I guess I need to just forget about the time we had that was perfect, but it’s difficult considering I wasn’t looking for a relationship (nor was he) but we kind of just ended up that way. I would do virtually anything (beyond stupid stuff like harming my kids) for him. Ugh. Help, someone say something to make me feel better (but nothing anti-him because a) he doesn’t deserve it; b) he will possibly read this at some point.)

I don't use anything anymore, but I've wondered if anyone has been in this weird mindframe before. It's like a bad joke that you'd never do. Let me set the scene.

You're in full blown withdrawal.  You have very little money. Finally, you can go get something and you're sweating and tense trying to get to the place. You walk by a food place, lets say a Mexican restaurant. You smell those pungent fumes through your withdrawal and it's nauseating at best.

My question is, have any of you ever had that weird idea, imaging that you go in and sit down and have a big meal, leaving you with no money and the inability to get something for a high? And now you're withdrawing while full on greasy food.

I mean not actually doing it, but just like one of those self destructive split second thoughts. Like jumping from a high place etc. You definitely would never actually do it, but just the thought of how terrible that would be.

I used to have that thought because it was a compulsive ""what if? How stupid would that be?"" thought. Sound familiar to anyone?",1515335175.0

I was snorting for a year before that. I'm not an every day user, and sometimes I will go months without using (by choice). I don't even think about it every day. I would say my use has increased very slowly until the last few months, where I would binge once a fortnight at most. 

As much as I love getting high, I just can't deal with withdrawal. From what I understand I only go through very light withdrawals no hurting bones, no RLS, very little sickness, but BAD depression with suicidal thoughts to the point where I isolate myself for days and stop all communication with anyone I know or care about. The solution would be to just stay high, but I refuse to become a full time every day user. That is definitely not what I want.

I don't even really know where I am going with this post, but I guess this is me admitting I have a bit of a problem. If I can't stop those impulses, that is a problem. Isolating myself from loved ones for days every couple of weeks is a problem. Having suicidal thoughts is a problem.

I've been using heroin for 7 years now. Switching between suboxone for a majority of time time, and only being being sober for about six months max a couple time before eventually relapsing.

I've been using for a while again now and after taking my last dose I got bored and decided to clean up some videos on my phone that were taking up storage space. I came across something I hadn't known existed. It was video I had made of myself, to myself. I must have made it while at the end of a bad binge. I was telling myself to not continue this lifestyle, while seeing a sadness I've never seen in myself before, about how this just wasn't worth it. I didn't watch more than 15 seconds into it before I stopped it. I sat and thought about things for awhile. 

For the first time I think I am starting to grasp onto the fact that it's not worth the binges anymore. I know the pain at the end but I seem to block it out before starting another. I obviously knew they were bad, but now I feel as though I need to take a more serious approach. I know I can do it. I've never doubted I was an addict and that I will always be one whether I'm using or clean. I just want to change my ways with a little help from people like myself. I know I can do it on my own, as in without rehab, and by talking to people on here. 

I have suboxone and xanax to help me get through this like usual, which is why I seem to repress the negative outcomes of prior binges, but depression plays a major role into my relapses. I just get bored I guess. What makes it hard for me to understand is that I had a normal childhood and I am in a good situation right now, have a good job, and a loving and supportive family. This just makes it harder for me to understand where my negative thoughts come from. I feel as though it makes it harder for me to grasp onto. Knowing that there is no obvious reason for the way I feel. 

Kratom isn't something I'm interested because I can and have detoxed myself many times to complete sobriety by tapering so the getting clean part isn't an issue for me. The issue is staying clean and refrain from taking that wrong step that eventually leads another relapse. 

You know how you can't help someone unless they are ready to be helped? Well I feel now is a time for me to take a shot at it. I am very independent so meetings and stuff like that are not for me. So while appreciated please don't suggest that. I am only looking for answers to my question. I'm just giving a bit of background for those who care to read, and can relate.

I know replacing one thing for another isn't a good idea, but I've got nothing to lose. No matter how many times it takes I'll eventually find a way out. I am just looking for some experiences and suggestions from others who may have been helped by my questions below, or have some insight on what may have helped them. 

****NO SOURCING****

*So here is my question*

I've heard ketamine and other disassociatevs have helpes others with withdrawal and depression or similar symptoms. I know there are different types or chemicals similar to them so I am curious which ones should I look into? I do not know a whole lot about them other than what I've read about positive experiences from people who are in similar situations as myself. If there are other recommendations of drugs that are different from the ones mentioned above that help in the same way I'd love to take a look into those as well. I'm not going into this blindly, as you can see by my post I've had some time to think about this, and I will do my research so don't feel the need to worry. 

I need a crutch so here's where I'm hoping to find my answer. If I wanted to go back to my old lifestyle I would so don't feel as if your suggestions will have any negative impact on what I chose to do.

She got no job and this dude is supporting her and I know it get's to the point she has to pan handle to shut the dude up for a day or two. 

I know she ain't fucking dude cause he anti-depressants totally killed her libido along with the 130mg methadone, plus she is 40+.  I feel like that guy is going to want he to open her legs soon because she is already pan handling to shut him up.  Anyway. This is out of my hands and just got MY gears turning as to how many people have flew under the radar as murderers and killed people with overdoses.  

Ok, I call her my girl as we are recently split and I kind of fucked things up by being a baby and shit accusing her of shit she ain't doing and going from living with someone 24/7 to nothing now and coming back to r/opiates cause of my ever growing loneliness.  Anyway, the question remains what is the likelyhood of some reported accidental overdoses actually be murders? and as always love you all, take care and be safe.",1515297758.0

I can’t even begin to tell you how many times I’ve called my boyfriend on my break to tell him how one of my patients is up to leave and we need to take them into our home because they were homeless and returning back to the streets in the freezing cold weather.  Working with patients who suffer from addiction has changed me so much. I feel honored that these patients are willing to open up to me and tell me the hardest truths of their lives. There are days that I literally fight tooth and nail with doctors/nurses/other counselors over who gets placement in the next unit because I feel so passionate about the fact that everyone who is seeking help deserves a fair shot. This job is nothing what I expected it to be like and I never in a million years expected it to shape me in the ways that it has. I guess this is a message to people who do want help, there are counselors out there who truly from the bottom of their hearts care about you, would fight tooth and nail for you and want to see you succeed.

I was wondering what's the lethal dose of tramadol (I know it's different for everyone but let's say for a lambda person )?
I actually have tramadol 50.mg/paracetamol 500mg. The highest dose I've ever took was  700mg of tramadol (taken during a night between 10pm and 4am) but I've read that the maximum dose anyone can prescribe you is 400mg per day because otherwise it's very dangerous, is it because of the paracetamol ? Is it only dangerous in the long term ?
And one last question, well... 2 last questions, I'm almost sure snorting tramadol is useless but is it morphine ? If you put tramadol powder in a cigarette paper ( for rolling, sorry for my bad English) and just swallow It, does it works? And with morphine?

I have been a opiate user since I was 17, my first opiate experience was snorting an og oc60 back in 2007, it resulted in me puking my brains out and feeling better than any human should feel followed by a heavy nod, I was immediately in love. My father is a cpp, and taught me about snorting those little red beauties as well as giving me my first pill. I wasn't a full blown addict until I was around 22 years old and shortly after OPs came out. I then told my dad about opana (the stop signs at the time) so he switched to them from the shitty OPs. I am and always have been a very high functioning addict working for one of the largest retail auto parts stores in the United states my entire adult life. Fast forward to 2018 and I'm still working in the retail auto parts business in the geographic center of the United States. I started dabbling in BTH roughly 6 months ago which scares me but what can you do, it's the progression of this disease most of us share in this community. I did start MMT 3 days ago as I am trying to better myself and get somewhat of a grip on my addiction. Worst case scenario it merely gives me a nice tolerance break.

It seems like on every single post where someone is expressing their woes over being broke and in crippling withdrawal, someone will chirp up with ""get some kratom brah.""

For all you people, I would like to tell you that kratom is not a wonder-cure for anyone and everyone who has an opiate addiction.  Putting aside the fact that many of the people I have seen who talk about what a miracle drug kratom is are either addicted to hydros or oxy (no hate for non-dope users, but fact is it's a much weaker substance), for some people, myself being one of them, kratom does precisely fuck-all.

I have tried 4 or 5 different strains of kratom, so all you people who are thinking of piping up and telling me that I ""just need to find the right strain"" can settle down.  Putting aside the fact that it's kinda ridiculous to expect people to buy and try 5 or 6 different strains if kratom searching for the right one, it just does nothing for some people.  Last time I had gone 24 hours without using, I parachuted 3g, 2g, 3g, and 2g of kratom in 15 minute intervals.  I experienced literally zero relief from my withdrawal symptoms.  I don't know how some of you people actually manage to take an ounce of this shit every day, but even tabling that issue, all the people talking about the wonders of kratom need to understand there are some people for whom it provides zero relief.  I see people recommending that guys in withdrawal spend the last of their cash on a couple ounces of kratom, and this is a terrible idea.

For all you people who can experience relief from ingesting an ounce of that vile plant, I congratulate you.  For me, it's plain gross and it doesn't do anything.  Period.",1515268852.0

There's no such thing as careful.,"She's got 3 boys and she was all they had. Their Dad wasn't any help, not lately anyway. He relapsed hardcore after he had to bury his oldest son a few months back. He's been numbing the pain with heroin. Not working, not even leaving the house. Not caring about anything but 'getting well'. 

See, most of the young people around here overdose and die. His son's death was the other side of the coin. He was shot and killed, they took his money and dope. He was 25. 

So she fought everyday to stay clean. Because the boys needed her and she needed them. I was so proud of her. She was doing so good. Sure, she was overwhelmed and needed a break, a buzz. I begged her not to. I OD'd in July so I know first hand how easy it is...to die. To underestimate the drug, overestimate your tolerance. To think you're being careful as you beat on deaths door. I've never been so grateful for modern medicine. BC of Narcan, I'm still here to tell my story. And the stories of those that aren't so fortunate. I hope that one day her boys realize how strong their mom was. 

That's how the story could've gone. It could have easily been the end of hers. Thank God they didn't have any rigs. Or her 6th month old would've cried out to deaf and dead ears. Like a surprising number of infants have done. 

There's a reason she didn't have a rig. There's a reason that the baby cried and somehow her BF came to.

Of course I couldn't wait until I got there. So I went to a restaurant a asked if I could use the restroom. It wasn't a minute since I locked the door when it knocked the first time. At first I played dead, took a shit and started prepping my shot. 



Then it knocked again. I yelled that I had cramps and needed another minute. Still, there was a woman outside rambling that one shouldn't block the restroom for that long. Luckily there were a huge party of girls, celebrating a birthday or something that argued in my favor.




I was so afraid that an employee would show up to open the door forcibly. Already my mind played out how they would open the door to me sitting on the capper, pants down, actually crapping and a needle in my bruised and swollen arm. It would've been the end of me.




When the lady resorted to knocking and lamenting even harder, I finished up whilst assuring I was coming out as loudly as possible. End of story was that she found it too smelly anyways and left. Imagine it hadn't been smelling legit like shit! The girls were super nice and do you know that, when someone gives you attention and you're stressed out you just start crying? When they assured me that she was the crazy one and that it was perfectly okay to take your time to poop, I was just done. Damn, that was close. What if those girls hadn't been there and that crazy bitch would've had the door opened? My heart is still beating like a mf... (could be the coke tho).

3. How's the experience? I could buy weed, easy in the greater philly area, but too lazy to figure out how to make the shit. Do they actually work?

This relapse lasted about 5 months. Just enough time that a full 8mg of suboxone strip isnt enough to feel normal.

Now, I had this international flight booked and I figured I'd induct onto suboxone during the flight because although subs dont make you feel 100%, the state they put you in isnt too horrible. Being on an airplane with no access to my dealer will force me to commit to the induction.

Also, I had read about this method of inducting where you take suboxone and then you use your DOC, and 24 hrs later you take more subs and do more of your DOC as needed until you gradually build up bupe in your receptors. This being the case, I took 4mg of suboxone, smoked some tar on top, and hopped on the plane.

While i was in the air, i started to feel antsy. It had been about 12 hours since my last sesh and I already had a bunch of bupe in me already, so i dosed 1mg of suboxone.

Fatal mistake. I suddenly started to feel a cold sweat and my heart started to pound. Ive felt this feeling before. This is precipitated withdrawal onset. The last time i felt this, i woke up my friend early on the AM and gunned past red lights to borrow some tar from him to get well. PSA: This actually works. They say nothing can take you out of precipitated withdrawals, but doing your DOC actually takes you out. Although, I hadnt taken a large dose. I never take more than 1-2mg of suboxone at a time for just that reason.

Anyway, so im in the air, and the withdrawal symptoms start kicking in, and theres still 2 hours left in my flight. And then a 1 hour layover. And then another 6 hour fucking flight.

Theres actually not much to say about what happened next, because i was just in excruciating withdrawal for 8 hours, while in a cramped seated position, on a latin american airplane. Just kicked like a fish nonstop. Nausea but no vomitting, so i wasnt as bad as i could have been. Extreme thirst, but every sip of water made me nauseous. Bowels fuckin throbbing. Cant fuckin get comfortable. Wanted to lay down so bad but had to remain in a seated position. Every second of every minute went by so slowly. I thought I would never fuckin end. I was praying for the plane to crash. Wanted to stand up and shout ""does anyone have any fucking opiate on them please god?""

It was such a desperate helpless position to be in. Took so much out of me.

Waited as long as i could and continued taking more and more .5-1mg doses of sub but the sickness wouldnt go away. Pure torture.

I cant believe some of you go full blown cold turkey like that or kick in prison... infinite respect. I 1000% would have called my dealer and hooked if i could have. Fuck that shit.",1515392060.0

I was wondering if anyone has info or experience with this? I am on Suboxone and I know I am not supposed to be chasing a high but I have been clean besides sub for about 3 months. The only reason I haven't taken anything is because I know the bupe will block it. I found some oxys in an old jacket and I didn't take them but I didn't get rid of them either. I find myself thinking about that opiate feeling a lot and how I wish I could feel it again. I don't think I'll be going back to it, Im much stronger now but the bupe only once in a great while makes me feel good. If there was an effective way to make the bupe feel better sometimes it would be huge in this mental battle I am waging, I know I could switch to methadone but I don't want to be fucked up I just want to feel a little bit of something. Idk I know it's stupid, but if anyone has info or experience with St John's wort and bupe please share.",1515389300.0

He told me they got wet. I know they weren’t fake - he’s solid and don’t play games etc..
I still didn’t want the puffy and swoll up k9s tho
I just feel like they probably lose potency after being wet and then dried out
I have no scientific or anecdotal evidence of that I just basically made it up and it sounded good enuf

What do u guys think?
Some of the ones he gave me were just a litttle puffy some of them had puffed up 50%..

I didn’t call him for a few days after that 
 I usually drop 4-500$ a day w him so he hit me w the ‘if u take the wet ones I’ll do them for 50% off price’ 
I haven’t replied yet..

On one hand it’s annoying having them like fall apart and shit

Other hand maybe that’s a deal?

Press Release

China announces scheduling controls on two fentanyl precursor chemicals
 

WASHINGTON – China’s Ministry of Public Security last week announced scheduling controls on two fentanyl precursor chemicals – NPP and 4ANPP, substances that can be used to make illicit drugs. The scheduling controls will take effect on February 1, 2018 and is the result of the ongoing collaboration between the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Government of China and their shared commitment to countering illicit fentanyl-class substances.

“Fentanyl compounds significantly contribute to the current opioid crisis in the United States.  By stemming the chemicals used to make these substances, this latest Chinese scheduling action will help save lives,” said DEA Acting Administrator Robert W. Patterson. “This scheduling action is an important step and a testament to the progress our countries are making together in addressing this epidemic.”

DEA and Chinese officials maintain frequent contact to collaborate and share data on the threat from fentanyl-class substances and their impact on the United States.  Information-sharing includes scientific data, trafficking trends, and sample exchanges. This dialogue has resulted in improved methods for identifying and submitting deadly substances for government control.

The Chinese Government previously controlled four fentanyl-class substances – carfentanil, furanyl fentanyl, valeryl fentanyl, and acryl fentanyl – which took effect on March 1, 2017, and another four new psychoactive substances/fentanyl-class substances - U-47700, MT-45, PMMA, and 4,4’ DMAR – which took effect on July 1, 2017.",1515367924.0

So the past two days have been kinda dry for me. Haven’t been able to come up on anything for a few days or get any cash for dope, up until last night. Last night out of the blue someone who owed me some cash paid me back and so I went and hit up my middle and told him I wanted to get a G. While on the way to meet the dboy with my middle, my middle calls him to make sure he’s got the same old fire dope he usually has and he confirms he does. After the wait of what seemed like forever, middle comes back and give me .8 of my g and he keeps the .2 for the meet. Well, at this point I’m pretty happy I’m gonna be well for a few days. So I decided I’d do just a little bigger shot than usual. I normally do a .1 shot, but last night I decided to do a .15-.2 shot to celebrate. After taking forever to hit like usual, I push down on old faithful and blast off to nodsville. I could tell instantly that I had done to much. At this point I was almost out of fuel so right after the shot I pulled from the parking lot I was in, to the gas station next to me. While driving over I told my middle I didn’t feel well and that I think I did to much. After parking at the gas pump I don’t remember a thing. My next memory is waking up in the back of an ambulance with an EMT telling me that he gave me narcan. I was so freaked out, this wasn’t supposed to happen to me right? This is shit only those crazy mofos on r/opiates post about right? Well I guessed wrong. When I get to the Er they start doing blood tests and shit, and next thing I know there is a state trooper beside me. He tells me that they charged me with a dui of drugs takes me to county after they release me from Er. Well I posted bond this morning from county and I’m still in shock about everything. I’m just not sure where I stand about it really. Part of me is telling me fuck heroin it almost killed me! But the other part wants to go right back and get more.

I always snorted my dope, and I remember there being SO many times where I was so physically sick that I would just set up shop and do a line in my car immediately after picking up. I had my own routine of doing my lines, and doing them in the car was never as good and easy as when I would do it at home; however, there were many times that it was totally necessary to do a line and get well before driving the 30 minute trek home. 

Now, my question for the shooters (and I’ve thought about this *so* many times but never knew anyone who did it to ask) - do you/have you ever done shots in the car immediately after picking up? It seems like there are so many steps and equipment involved to shoot in a car, but I understand the need to get well right away. I’m so curious. ",1515358186.0

Before switching to Vivitrol I was on sub matinence for about a year. 

My last relapse was about 6 months ago, luckily it only lasted a couple weeks and I promptly got back on the shot. Long story short I’m currently at a crossroads. I really feel like the Vivitrol isn’t working for me. It’s not curbing my cravings and is also causing my depression and anxiety to worsen.

I’ve been thinking about asking my doctor to take me off of Vivitrol and to put me back on suboxone. Have any of you ever done this? While it seems like an ass-backwards decision, as most people would transition from subs to Vivitrol, I think i would be better off.

The question is would he will be willing to do this? While I feel like it’s totally my choice, the fact I’m opiate free might mean I can’t just go back on suboxone. I guess all I can do is ask but sadly I feel like the only way to switch would be to skip my apt, relapse then go back and ask for a sub induction.

I guess what I'm getting at here is that even the same person, me, can have different timelines when it comes to sub induction. if i waited to follow the timelines exactly I'd probably not be feeling as close to normal as I feel now. 


I just wonder how long I can keep going back and forth between dope and subs before something stops working. I think my dope didn't work as great last time as i didn't wait long enough to dose after taking the subs. Part of me is scared that I like this bullshit back and forth, it's like I found a way to skirt the system and i wonder when i will be getting my comeuppance.. Nothing can work like this forever.

I took 10mg this morning so I am now left with 5mg which I plan to take in the AM tmrw.

The WD isn't that bad as I've only started using recently and I know what opiate (opium) withdrawal feels like. However, I have this very extreme feeling of depression, unlike on any other WD I've been through. I haven't felt depressed like this even during the worst of my opium WD. Like.. I just feel so gloomy, so dead, everything is just pointless and I can't even shower. I feel like this is gonna last forever.

To make it worse I got into a pretty bad car accident on the highway today where my car literally spun across the entire expressway at nearly 60mph (not my fault, but the guy who caused it ran), car repairs are so expensive, the fucking tow truck cost $500, and my insurance will skyrocket. It's not that terrible as I am holding a good job but I'd rather have spent that on heroin. I have a bunch of bumps and scrapes that are painful and fuck I just want my dope already.

I'm so pissed off at myself for trying this shit. Snorting heroin isn't even that profound and I got stronger effects from oxy, but it's so much more... tantilizing. I can't explain it but I'm sure you know what I mean. Ever since my first dose, my every second thought has been about heroin. I'm worried I'm wasting a lot by snorting. 

Sorry, this is just turning into a rant in order to take my mind off the gloomy feelings of shit.

**TL;DR:** Is there anything that get rid of this feeling? I have Kratom and have been taking it all day but my opiate tolerance has made Kratom to be either I don't feel it or I vomit for 24 hours. Will high doses of lope work? I'm so desperate. I'm far too unmotivated to get up and go to the gym. Fuuuuck",1515482166.0

Then you get you a nice fat sack, sucked nasty old dick for that $20 sack, or stole some shit in the mall and damn near g yo ass busted, or stole a couple bills from yo grandmas purse....but you got it. 

Can’t wait make up your shot fast as fuck, hands all shaking and shit, almost spill the cap of dope but catch it. This is gonna be the best fucking moment in my life in a minute....this is gonna be so good, mane.

I’m gonna hit myself just fine cause I did earlier so I’m out that dope shooting funk.

Everybody is going to tell me it won’t work. Well I’m going to try my damndest. I’ve been on a binge for about 3 weeks. I’ve gotten back to my old gram a day of tar smoked on foil. So here’s what I have to work with:
I have about 0.35 left of a bag I bought last night to last me until Thursday (the next 2 days.) I know for certain that this will be enough to hold me over until then. I won’t really be high at all, but I certainly won’t be sick.
On Thursday I get my check. I am going to buy a gram (the last one) and continue to only smoke when I feel the withdrawal creeping in, and only smoking a very small amount to keep me well enough to function/work and sleep. 
After I run out of that gram, I’ll have two options (considering I haven’t given into temptation and I’ve been following the taper.) I can buy another gram and extend the taper, using even less over time, or I can drop off at that point and call it quits. I have an unlimited supply of loperamide and clonidine for free, so that’s what I’ll use for a bit when all is said and done to make the end as comfortable as possible. 
So what do you suggest? Do you think the taper will even work? Do you think I should taper with one gram, or go for a longer taper with 2? I need to be as comfortable as possible throughout this process, because I have to work in public (as a customer service manager) through the process. Help me with this situation if you have any input. Thanks.",1515478334.0

Bruising without even pushing plunger down.,"Hey all so this is a first for me... I having trouble finding a spot to shoot on my left arm. I looked in the mirror and could see my veins easier so I outlined/circled a few spots that I couldn't see just looking down on my arm. It's on my bicept.  I am all out of 31 guage needles so I bust out my clean new 29 guage ones. Stuck in wayy easier than re using the same 31 guages. 

So I pulled back on the plunger after poking it in and didn't register so I pulled the needle out of my arm. And immediately blood did come out(normally only happens after I get a shot in the vein) and that spot on my arm bruised and theres a lump like I missed a shot.  But I didn't injext into that spot at all.  I ended up only getting a partial in the end...  My left arm really needs a break but I never saw these veins on my bicept before looked clean and fresh until this bruise... I think it's weird how there's a lump and a bruise and I didn't inject anything.  Is this a sign of something worse? 

Thanks ahead of time. 

Also I did the same things in my hand where I didn't register but when I pulled out blood would come out like I did register. Like I said I never see blood come out unless it's a hit. ",1515474091.0

But no, she basically gave me the same thing as my pcp.  Well, she dropped the mgs down from 20s to 10s.  The main reason I was getting 20s was cause I pay out of pocket and the lower the pill count, the cheaper the script. My pcp gives my half the number of pills at twice the mgs, so it's a lot cheaper.  I was so happy that I was getting something that I totally forgot to mention it, so my script was almost 70 bucks.  And she still wants the old MRI and a new one and an x-ray.  But I'm happy as hell that it went as smoothly as it did.

I'm more costly than diamonds, more costly than gold - the sorrow I bring is a sight to behold.
And if you need me, remember I'm easily found.
I live all around you, in schools and in town.
I live with the rich, I live with the poor, I live down the street, and maybe next door.
My power is awesome - try me you'll see.
But if you do, you may never break free.
Just try me once and I might let you go, but try me twice, and I'll own your soul.
When I possess you, you'll steal and you'll lie.
You'll do what you have to just to get high.
The crimes you'll commit, for my narcotic charms, will be worth the pleasure you'll feel in your arms.
You'll lie to your mother; you'll steal from your dad.
When you see their tears, you should feel sad.
But you'll forget your morals and how you were raised.
I'll be your conscience, I'll teach you my ways.
I take kids from parents, and parents from kids, I turn people from God, and separate from friends.
I'll take everything from you, your looks and your pride, I'll be with you always, right by your side.
You'll give up everything - your family, your home, your friends, your money, then you'll be alone.
I'll take and I'll take, till you have nothing more to give.
When I'm finished with you you'll be lucky to live.
If you try me be warned this is no game. 
If given the chance, I'll drive you insane.
I'll ravish your body, I'll control your mind.
I'll own you completely; your soul will be mine.
The nightmares I'll give you while lying in bed.
The voices you'll hear from inside your head.
The sweats, the shakes, the visions you'll see.
I want you to know, these are all gifts from me.
But then it's too late, and you'll know in your heart, that you are mine, and we shall not part.
You'll regret that you tried me, they always do.
But you came to me, not I to you.
You knew this would happen. 
Many times you were told, but you challenged my power, and chose to be bold.
You could have said no, and just walked away.
If you could live that day over, now what would you say?
I'll be your master; you will be my slave.
I'll even go with you, when you go to your grave.
Now that you have met me, what will you do?
Will you try me or not? 
Its all up to you.
I can bring you more misery than words can tell.
Come take my hand, let me lead you to hell.""

I wanted to binge during the holidays, wanted to get a clear head for a week and start working again tmrw. But I binged until now. Yesterday I stayed awake forever, shooting speedballs and overslept until 4pm today. I overslept a date that should've brought in 300 bucks, that guy won't meet me again I guess. That's shitty. Since a new law came last year, I can't use online platforms to look for customers without running the danger to pay at least a fine and be registered as a prostitute. So I've been meeting only guys I know and like which are exactly 2. One of those 2 doesn't live in Germany and only comes around every other month for business trips. I mean, I study, my career is a thing that could happen. I did everything right until now and never slipped up so bad that my addiction was suspected. But limits are being pushed I think. 




 I'm as broke as I can get right now. Can't draw money with any of my cards and now I'm sitting here, waiting for the man, hoping he'll front me enough to get through the day. 




I overslept my maintenance doc, too, didn't pick up my script for tomorrow and now I don't have money, don't have drugs and have a miserable coke hangover. I hate myself. How am I supposed to get through work? How am I going to get through that oral exam on the 23rd? Haven't studied enough by far. How can I be so stupid? I wish I would die before I gamble away everything... When I think about getting clean, I just don't see it. Of course atm I'm not in the best mood, but if today wasn't my last free day I would've missed work without calling in sick. It. Wouldn't have been the first time and excuses last only so long. Hope you guys are having a better day. 




PS: I got my dope, managed to not fiend for coke and hope that I can get home and fall asleep in time to get up punctual tomorrow.

They threw everything they could at it, Torodol, Ativan, Zofran, Reglan, Benadryl, Bentyl, Zanaflex, Pepsid, and so forth before finally having to give me a 1mg dose of Dilaudid by IV. 

I felt and still do feel like I've been defeated. However, I had the following text conversation with my mom:

>Me: They're gonna try reglan and benadryl and call [pain doctor]

>Mom: Okay sweetheart I am hoping that works!!! 💖🙏

>Me: It didn't work they called [pain doctor]. They're gonna do a one time dose of Diluadid. They made the decision for me. Then they're gonna discharge me. I see [pain doctor] tomorrow and [GI Doctor] tuesday.  ... I think it'll prevent an admission at least.

>Mom: Oh wow sorry it didn't work

>Me: ***I'm not going to reset my sobriety counter either. Cause this is legitimate I tried so hard to avoid it. too.***

>Mom: you worked hard and ***this is not recreational. I agree.***

>Me: Thanks ya. Definitely not recreational. Thank you. That alone means a lot. I'm so bummed to be in this situation. I was just hoping it would improve ya know?

I'm also on a cellphone, so please excuse any formatting issues. FTP, LTL 

I normally take 120 mg OxyContin once a day and they usually last anywhere between 20-24 hours before I start to feel any of the withdrawal symptoms. On Monday morning at 8am, I took my usual 120 mgs (three 40 mg ER pills cut in half) and later on in the evening I started to feel a sinus headache coming on so I took 50 mg of Benadryl and fell asleep. I woke up at 9:30 and felt fine, which took me by surprise. I was able to make it until 1pm before the whole runny nose, yawning and cold chills started. My question is, has anyone else experienced anything like this and can I start taking Benadryl on days where I know that I won't be able to score on time? Or was this just a one time thing? 
Thanks for reading! Have a great day!

TL:DR- when I took some Benadryl, I noticed that I went longer without feeling any withdrawal symptoms. Anyone else experience this too?",1515586391.0

But, I think it's good to acknowledge the silver linings in life, even for the ugliest things... so, please share one good thing that has come from your opiate addiction. (Or just your opiate use, if you think you're not to that point yet)

For me, it's made me a more compassionate person, simply because I realize now that it's easy to be strong and friendly when you feel well, and hard when you don't. I mean, I knew that before, but going through that cycle over and over has really hammered it home to where I really *feel* it now. Now when I encounter someone who is acting weak or mean, my first impulse is to wonder if they are not feeling well... and I also refrain from judging them. How *can* I judge? When I have no idea what burden they carry inside?

Another good thing is that I'm pretty sure it has permanently improved my social anxiety. It's something I would notice when I was high, but the benefits have stuck around even after weeks or months of abstaining. I think it has a therapeutic effect that gave me the space to change the negative thinking that was causing my social anxiety.",1515583557.0

Yes we're losers but only in the eyes of something we really shouldn't be judged/identified by. Any self identification as a loser is a different problem I'm not going to address, but it likely stems from an unrealistic standard determined by society of what you're supposed to be.We have some wiggle room use it to not beat on yourself a little bit. 

Also remember the more effort you put into name calling contests over reddit, the more it will hurt your self esteem when you're done with it.

Can you shorten the withdrawal and if so how long should I use the short acting opiates before I go cold turkey?","TLDR: If you become dependent on long acting opiates (methadone/suboxone) is it possible to switch and become dependent on short acting opiates so that the withdrawal is shorter when you go cold turkey or just to kratom?

I have always noticed that an opiate/oid with a long half life has comparatively longer withdrawals when you you stop taking them.

I been taking unprescribed black market methadone at about the same dose abour ~95% of the days since october 1st 2017. The other 5% I was using ecp heroin.

Before October I was using a combination of raw opium that I used oral and heroin every day since around the beginning of June. Prior to that I had been clean for several months. Obviously because I have as much methadone as I want and the only limiting factor is money I have cheat days but I generally stick to a fairly rigid routine because in order to feel any kind of high from methadone I have to use absurd amounts and the high is also not as quality as some other types of drugs.

I have heard withdrawal from methadone and suboxone can last months and is generally horrific and should be avoided at all costs unless you do a long long taper.

My question is if switch to back to a short acting opiate/oid such as oxycodone or morphine or even heroin for long enough, could I shorten the length of the withdrawal? How long do you think I would have to be on the short acting opiate to make a difference.

Ok so long story short I’ve been taking oxycodone / hydrocodone pretty much every day for the past month. Before that it was just occasionally, got a wisdom tooth pulled + a prescription... and that was that. 

Anyways here I am. I need about 20-25mg of oxycodone or 30ish of hydro to feel anything. I never dose more than 2 times a day, sometimes only at night. 

I can definitely go 24 hours without experiencing any withdrawals, but then I always take a dose so I really haven’t gone long enough to truly know. 

I feel like I’m doing a pretty small amount... I had a heroin problem 6 years ago and this just seems like a totally different (and way less dangerous / addicting) problem. 

I get another wisdom tooth out Thursday, so I’ll get a script. Planning on taking those and then quitting when they’re gone. Last tooth they gave me 20 5mg Perc and 20 Vic

Idk. Any opinions on if I’m just overthinking it? Will I even go through real withdrawals? Thanks guys. ",1515544506.0

Help,"Hey Fam❤Not sure if I would be better off posting this in r/kratom.. But I don't know those people in there lol And I love you guys and trust your judgement. So here's my question..

I've been an opiate addict for 10 years now. And doing fent for most of this past year. Between a G and a G and a half a day. Well, the time has come to kick. I've gotten mixed answers regarding using kratom to come off of fent. Some have said, it won't touch me because it's not dope. Others have said the opposite. Let me specify, I'm not sure if what I've been using is actually fent or an analog. My guess would be an analog because it lasts a long time, and has legs for days. 

I know I'm going to taper down as low as possible before kicking. But would Kratom help with fent wds? Or is fent too strong. And if it will help, which strain do I go with? I've heard Red Bali. But I'm open to other suggestions. Need to figure this out and soon! Thank you for reading this and trying to help me😀😊

Edit- Forgot to mention, I've kicked before using suboxone. Subutex, and methadone. I've only taken kratom in wds a couple times but it was only for 1 day at a time. And I was using dope at the time. So thats why I wanted to try Kratom to detox this time, if it will actually help. I fucking hope so!",1515535060.0

However, I am desperately searching for something that offers some glimpse of a more ""progressive,"" approach. Anyone have a suggestion that I should check out?","I have gotten to the point where I am beaten down and ready to commit. I have finally gotten to a point in my addiction where the idea that this disease will kill me has become very real. Before it was just a concept. It didn't feel as if the way I used, or what I was doing could ever end up with me accidentally killing myself. However, this run that I am currently on has just been unbelievably desperate and straight up reckless. I remember having to buy some new stuff from a guy I had never bought from before. I had never tried anything he was selling, and normally I would take the necessary precautions to make sure I wasn't loading up an insanely powerful shot. For some reason I just went ahead and loaded up a full shot, and when I was about to be done injecting it I remember saying to myself ""well there's no going back now. Let's hope for the best here."" Next thing I know I am waking up two hours later extremely disoriented, and not knowing what had happened. As soon as I had figured out what had just happened I just got on my knees and began thanking some God I don't even believe in really. Since then it has just become very real that it is only a matter of time before I end up kill myself. Given all that I am ready to go to treatment for what will be like the 13,14,or 15th time. I have no idea at this point. I am also someone that just doesn't believe in the way a traditional rehab is set up and run. I don't think that telling everyone there is only a single way that this thing can be achieved is healthy, or even true. So when I get to these places I just keep to myself. I don't talk. I don't voice those opinions. I just stay quiet, and develop my own routine that I believe is beneficial to me, and I don't tell anyone else how they should be spending their time there. I am specifically talking about developing a regular routine that involves, meditation, yoga, reading, some form of creativity, and a healthy diet. None of this is very ""out there."" It is just stuff that isn't necessarily taught at your traditional rehab, and I am just so tired of going to these same places, reading the same info packets, watching the same movies, listening to the same speakers. It just doesn't fucking work for me, and if you want to tell me I am arrogant, and self centered, and not as unique as I think I am go right ahead. I don't see it that way. I see the way this epidemic has spread, and the way these treatment centers pack them in, and spit them out, and I don't think it is that far fetched to say something is wrong. Anyways I am beginning to rant now, and I was only coming here to ask if someone has gone anywhere on the east coast and would recommend it to me based on everything I have said here. I have very good insurance until that ends at the end of Feb. so it is time for me to capitalize on that privilege for the last bit of time that is available to me. Also please do not assume that I am asking for the nicest facilities that offer a hot tub, a sauna, massages every morning, a personal trainer every afternoon... etc.. I am just looking for a place that wont immediately tell me that I am essentially dumb for thinking that MAYBE, JUST MAYBE smoking weed every once in awhile isn't going to immediately bring the house down and kill everything I hold dear.

So then I smoked a few bits off the foil, then loaded up another 2 shots, 1 with about 100mg in and one with about 50 / 60mg in case I needed to top-up.

So I slammed the 100mg, gave it 10 minutes (Just to be sure) and, while I did feel alright, I could've felt a lot better, so I slammed the 50mg as well.

I don't remember much after that, but I awoke with my head resting on the closed toilet seat, I had the worlds most excruciating headache, felt deathly sick and was spewing up for a good couple of hours, my body was covered in cold sweat, and movement was laboured.

7pmifx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7pmifx/the_relapse_carousel/,9,https://redd.it/7pmifx,JrSmith82,The Relapse Carousel,"8 months ago, with my life going nowhere (slamming goof/speedballs for 3 years) and an inability to find veins without a mighty struggle, I thought I’d give rehab a shot, at least long enough for my veins to heal up and resurface. So I’m doing some 90 day program in a county facility but clashing heads with counselors and staff members over misinformation regarding addiction, & AA.NA fellowship book thumpers who, quite frankly, don’t know a goddamn thing about the most effective approach to helping addict populations at large & seem to think that the anecdotal evidence they use to validate their approaches to “recovery” carry the weight of some statistically significant findings published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. 

None of these people actually bothered me though, and in fact, I stuck around long enough to realize that 1)I’d completely forgotten what it was like to be sober & 2)I think I may prefer this sobriety thing to withdrawing my balls off each morning before hustling up a shot. Unfortunately, I was one of the younger 20-somethings in this facility, and the younger dudes tend to stick together, so when heroin and rigs both found their way into the facility, I VERY reluctantly shot up for a couple of days & got kicked out. 
To sum up the last five months, I was homeless for about a week, during which I managed to OD on a glorious speedball before quickly checking into another program, with much more motivation than simply “making shooting up easier.” I still relapsed inside this place—again with considerable reluctance, indicating to me that I’m much closer to sobriety than I’ve ever been—but the difference this time being that I was allowed to finish the program & hooked up with 3 months of sober living.
 
I was fucking determined to slam the door shut this time around so I took the Vivitrol route and things were splendid for months, right up until they weren’t. This has been my first week under a reduced level of care(weekly outpatient) and while making a pit stop at 7/11 before seeing my Vivitrol doc last Friday(30+ days since last shot, tolerance low), I run into an old rehab friend who tells me he has some china in his pocket. Now, china on the west coast is like spotting a Yeti riding a fucking unicorn, so china usually signals “fent” for me, but instead of having a healthy fear and respect for fucking dying, I couldn’t bring myself to turn it down. 

So 120+ days of sobriety and cool new job be damned, I did a “baby” shot that knocked me on my ass hard enough to nod out on the 7/11 counter trying to pick out a pack of cigarettes. 

Of all the relapses, this last one hurt the most. I’d like to make this abundantly clear—I REALLY want to stop, but thus far that shot has not taken anything away from me except a clean date. I always told myself, “if circumstances XYZ hold in my life, I won’t feel like shooting dope.” Now, all the shit leading up to this relapse felt like a perfect storm of terrible luck and timing, but I can’t stop telling myself “hey, you didn’t die, maybe you can chip a couple times a month and just stop obsessing over it between uses,” but I know exactly where that will lead, so I just wanna know 

**TL;DR Does the relapse carousel ever fucking stop??**

Specifically, I take 500/50mg of caffeine/ephedrine 3x daily for weight loss/control and for energy. Would the increased norepinephrine from this stack be inhibited in its re uptake because of the tramadol and result in far to much norepinephrine in the cns? Or is norepinephrine not really affected by this stack? Or, since I know caffeine acts on the adrenal glands, is there a difference in norepinephrine as a systemic adrenal hormone versus as a CNS neurotransmitter? I’m also admittedly not sure how the ephedrine works in this stack; I used to know but it’s been so long and the stack was successful so guess I just let myself forget and just went with what worked lol. Does the ephedrine work in the CNS? Or can it not cross over into it and that’s why people monkey with and create meth? 

Anyways, I already take an SSRI for depression so any venture into tramadol will be very slow and measured as is, I just wanted to know if any of y’all knew how it would interact with this stimulant stack I take. I appreciate the input,

I have been reading and posting in r/opiates for a long time (this is a different account than my normal). As we all know fentanyl has been showing up in a TON of heroin lately on the streets, really it seems like a majority of it (depending on where you are) has at least some fent in it. It's also been showing up elsewhere too, in counterfit oxies and other opiate/opioid pills, and even xanax or other things. 


I think we can agree this is all disgusting and the dealers who do this are scumbags. Most of them are idiots and hand mix it too, resulting in hotspots, and that kills many people. Also the counterfit pills are even more awful since people doing oxy or vicodin have much lower tolerances than people using heroin. It's terrible either way to sell fentanyl as anything else than fentanyl.


With all of that being said, if you have any questions about fentanyl or any of its analogues, feel free to come over to r/fentanyl or r/carfentanil. We are trying to do good work there with harm reduction and trying to inform people about the dangers of fentanyl without demonizing it like the media has. When it is used correctly, fentanyl and its analogues can be very useful medicine. When used incorrectly, it can used to murder (and I use that word on purpose) many. 


I hope this is okay to post about another subreddit here. I don't want to take traffic away from r/opiates, but rather allow people to use both subs appropriately and inform people that there is a place to discuss fentanyl and its analogues specifically.

Yeah there is somekind of warm but that doesn't feel like everyone describes it, it just feels like your body temperature went up, like walking into more heated room, or going outside in the winter and then you feel less cold than you would doing this sober. Other than that, it increases social skills and make you want to talk, in bigger doses you just talk stupid things and may do some stupid things + forget things.

Besides that I can't see any other profits of taking morphine, you just fell like your legs get weak/soft, slight euphoria-rush (but it's nothing compare to pure MDMA) in your body and head. It last only 1-2 minutes and then slowly coming down to what I wrote above. Is this everything, whole peak? nothing more? [I knew that opioids always worked differently for me](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7ktqhi/opioids_doesnt_give_me_any_euphoria/), but really? 

It doesn't even make eating more pleasurable, oxycodone did.

And it's very addicting, very fucking addicting 5 minutes. I just went clean from oxycodone binge (- my first one ever to be accurate), (like 80-100mg at the worst daily, 15-20 on the first days and this took 3 maybe 4 mouths - fuck and costed me shit load of money) this 60-some days (or even less) clean were so miserable, even on benzos, even with friend (singular intentionally, have no more friends beside a few in the internet), complete apathy, I didn't wanted to do anything, play games, go out with my friend, go anywhere. Tramadol (that slow release thing 100mg) that helped me to feel a bit normal lately, like before I started my first binge, but still miserable.

**TLDR;** - Does morphine peak + euphoria last only 5 first minutes and then only leave you with increased social skill + feeling of warm (but kinda like you when you wear more clothes or go to more heated room)?

I'm currently in a tough spot :(  the county i live in I'm south Florida makes it practically impossible to get your hands on clean pins. So needless to say I'm mutilating myself with the last two i have. It's honestly terrible. Has anyone ever overcame this situation? Do you have any tips on how i can get a fresh pack? This is the shittiest set of laws in this county and it can't be good for me and the thousands of other addicts here. Is there a trick to getting them from a pharmacy or somegthing!

edit: almost forgot: this room and its moderators are not affiliated with the subreddit and it has its own rules, regulations, and etiquette. should an issue arise do not take it up with the moderators of r/opiates as they have no say and nothing to do with the operation thereof.

so basically i've figured out what went wrong with tinychat. now, only the creators of the original room can have full moderator powers. i'm considering moving things back there because it supports connecting with phones (albeit crappy) and suchlike. as for tonight, i'll be chilling in both rooms and letting people choose. the tinychat room that i'm temporarily using is https://tinychat.com/room/everythingisstil. I'm not choosing that out of any sort of self-promotional bullshit, it's just that it's the only one that it lets me fully moderate in, which basically means that I can use the youtube player. The other room, located in the sidebar, is at https://www.ezcapechat.com/rooms/whereisopiatechat, which does not easily work with phones but is more stable and allows anyone to add to the youtube queue. i'd prefer to use the one in the sidebar which is the ezcapechat room but if too many people have to connect with phone apps, i'll talk to the mods about moving things back to tinychat somehow. please come by, however, and gaze upon me as i exhaust my supply of speedball materials in one fell swoop. below are the rules and i hope to see you there. and with that, here's the usual copy and paste job.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

01/10/18

The lethal, apparently fentanyl-laced contaminated materials are coming from Henderson, NC (a notorious hub for the flow of H into the other major cities of NC) and I have seen them pop up in Raleigh, NC, but I don't know where else they are. As Henderson is the source of so much of the state's narcotics, they could be anywhere from Charlotte and Asheville throughout the Triangle (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill) to the eastern coastal areas (such as Wilmington). But Henderson and Raleigh are 100% verified.

The bags are coming as stamps labeled ""Beat Street"" in blue and the material appears as a slightly fluffy white powder with no rocks in it, which dissolves to a mildly tan solution, much like good ECP should. I do not have access to reagents, but the friend who they came from tested his urine after consuming them numerous times, and every time has consistently come up strongly positive for both fentanyl and heroin. Based on the string of overdoses (and even deaths) associated with them, my friend's drug test results, as well as the extreme potency and powdery white consistency (and tendency to dissolve quickly and transparently), I think it's very definitely fentanyl-laced. On top of being extremely potent, these bags are quite a bit heavier than the average legitimate stamp bag in this area (which tend very often to be only about 25-35mg), which only adds to the danger.",1515637157.0

I couldn’t for the life of me fall asleep, and today all throughout the day I just felt horrible. I have a tendency to become addicted to substances based on past benzo use, and I am not really sure when I should start to be concerned about being a heavy user, like what is that considered?

Found a nice ad for ""party favors"" and messaged with the guy back and forth. I asked if he had ""H"" and he immediately hit me with the ""are you a cop?"". Nope, just a junkie bro. I asked him if he had anything other than what he offered and after a little bit he shot back with roxies. I thought, why the fuck not, right? 

So he says he has 10 on him and then-- wait for it this is the kicker--

he says he wants $170 for them. Of course, I'm thinking this is all wayyy to good to be true right? Of course it is. But I'm dumb. And I'm desperate. 10 roxies are any where from $200 to $300 for me, normally. I'm thinking, Theyre pressed. They're fake.

I show up at the spot we agree on and I see some sketchy young kid in a beanie. I'm immediately like, you gotta be fucking me. I hear sirens and shit and the kid looks like he's packing. I know this is how I'm fucking going down. Over some roxies in WD. Only, he hears the sirens and gets sketched the fuck out and darts into the store we're close to, which isn't weird because it's a liquor store. I'm like, sure, okay. Maybe he's not undercover, then. I light up a cigarette and look like I'm waiting. On the inside, I'm shaking in my fucking boots dudes. I am sweating, my hands are shaking, I think I'm gonna puke. I just want to fucking get high and take the edge off the shitty feeling.

""Yeah, theyre gone.""

I'm being paranoid, but I have this awful feeling that travel card wallet with my train tickets and photo ID may have fallen out of my pocket next to my desk at work. It has a small, burnt, folded up square of foil and foil tube tucked behind the photocard.

I'm 99.9% sure it's actually safely in my work drawer with the lighter I used to have a cigarette at lunchtime - but it got me thinking/worrying anyway. 

Even if found, its likely they'll just put it on my desk. However, if someone pokes through it - even still, most people won't know what the hell it is - **but** just in case! Has anyone ever had to make a decent excuse about paraphernalia that paid off? Any suggestions?

A few years ago I had driven over to a customer for my PC repair job I was working at the time. I'd been there a good few hours and I had *really* begun to sweat. I had dope in my car, but no foil to smoke it. The nearest place to buy any was likely close to an hour away. 

So, I finished the job and I straight up said to the woman I'd been working for;

""Hey, my car is having troubles with its radiator, its not cooling - I don't suppose you have something flexible and waterproof I could wrap round the coolant pipe to keep it from leaking until I get to a garage""

I'm fucking struggling br/opiates...Really struggling and I know only you guys will understand just how bad I feel. 

It's foggy, frozen, and wet where it isn't *ice-y*. And I walked through it to get my fix. Enveloped in the fog I just disappear and it's a comfort knowing I can't be seen. Knowing I'm a few minutes away from disappearing emotionally. But then the thoughts come rushing in like a giant wave. One after another and I realize I'm terrified. Of what? *what happens after today? When they drug test me? All you had to do... Just don't put a fucking needle in your arm Admiral.* But I know I will. I know I just have to turn around and go home and the sickness will come but it will also pass, I just have to be strong for few days..Just a few days.

I can't confront life on life's terms, I'm either too weak or just lack the fiber to stand up to it. 

(*Probation, yadayada, used, yadayada..*)

It's just been a roller-coaster of emotions. I've been dosing myself with kratom all day to get this obsession off my mind, Because it really is that... Obsession. But when I spike up and relief washes over me and the thoughts stop, for a moment then I think to myself *dammit you've done it again, why cant you just fucking stop*. 

That thought is immediately followed by *oh, this feeling is why* 

I hope you all stay safe, and I hope if you want to use, you can score. IF you are clean, I hope you stay clean and live a happy fulfilling life. 

I love you all. I hope you find happiness somewhere else besides the needle. Just because I am weak now, I know I will overcome this...

The British used this on the Turks while they were trying to take Jerusalem in WWI. They dropped a sack with fake plans to attack Gaza so the Turks would move their forces away from the actual attack point of Beersheba. But here's where opiates come into play..

Lost my phone, $400 taser (not just your gay ass stun gun, it fires electrical hooks into you, not fun) and my 3rd juul (more annoying than valuable). Not gonna go into details but yeah I got shot over weed.

Figured I'd share it with that cancerous board known as r/trees just to remind them that shit happens. 

Within minutes some very serious prick comments that I was reported to law enforcement and that it would be easy to trace my city based on comment history (true) and that I was promoting violence and thug culture with my story. WTF!? 

Nah bro, anything but. You think I thought it was cool to take a shot to the leg so close to my dick that of my dick was swinging the wrong way itd be gone? Not at all. It was a reminder to be careful out there and even with legal weed people will still shoot you over less than a pound.

Since I have recently found out that we are allowed to link people openly where to buy syringes online (and other harm reduction equipment apparently). Look no further! FREE SHIPPING ON ALL ORDERS! BEST QUALITY!

This is the Easy Touch website where you can buy insulin syringes in all different sizes viable for IV use. Free shipping available on all orders! Says the free shipping option takes 5-6 days, but it took 3 days from shipped to my mail box. Shipped from Texas to east coast US. 

Easy Touch is (IMO) the best syringe brand. Actually, they are tied for #1 with BD, except BD syringes are usually a lot more expensive. These cost the exact same amount as buying in person at a pharmacy (at least a box of 100 is, 10 packs cheaper in stores)

Return address on package does say something about medical (I can look up exact return address name tomorrow if anyone cares to know (I think it is Prime Medical Store)), but does not reference syringes or needles at all. Packaging is discreet except for that one fact.

If you can't order to your home, get a PO Box if you really need to. They aren't that expensive for the smallest box (if your package doesn't fit in the box they either leave a slip to pick it up at the counter or leave a key for a bigger box that your package is in) and you could use it to get other harm reduction items online also (fent test strips, micron filters, bacteriostatic water, micron filters and many more!).

Don't reuse needles just because all the dumb pharmacies around you won't sell them and you have no needle exchanges around you! Practice safe injection techniques always! Clean syringes are so cheap there is no excuse not to always use one!

I hope this helps someone out there. Stay safe my junkie brothers and sisters!",1515732833.0

So I was the cause of my own misery like all of us junkies tend to be; only this time it stemmed from an attempt at kindness. (Aforementioned misery was having to wait until 11am the next day to pick up instead of 8pm the night before as was planned )

My main dude is a massive pot head. Like,  him and I would’ve been mad tight back in the day based on our outrageous tolerances and love for any and all things weed. Now being a junkie I ain’t got time or money for weed anymore but I do happen across some concentrates and edibles occasionally. This time I got my hands in some homemade red velvet weed cupcakes. Tasted like bud more than red velvet. But they knocked you on your ass regardless of tolerance. So when I picked up from him a few days ago I gave him one. 

A couple nights later he decides to eat it and forgot to tell me so I could clock how long until it hit him and how hard. So at 8pm I ask to meet. 8:05 he’s like yeah gimme fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes go by I text. THen call, no answer. I call and text two more times each and say fuck it and leave him a message saying let’s do this in the AM like we often do. He finally calls me back at 1030 apologizing sounding fucking gobsmacked pleading to meet in the AM instead of now cause he forgot he ate that cupcake and needs to stay laying down. We agree on 6am. 

I call him at 6 and nothing. Crazy call this mofo until seven and then go back to bed. He hits me up at around 9 something, just waking up and frantic cause it was his turn to drive the kids to school. Then from 9-11 we stay in contact while he drops the kids off then doubled back to get my shit to meet me. I’m texting him laughing at him and busting his balls about his pot tolerance until we meet at Arby’s and I finally get my shit. 

But yeah. That’s the last fucking time I ever give him an edible. ",1515727546.0

The ingredients in one tab are: Codeine - 8mg. Paracetamol - 500mg. Caffeine - 30mg. Sodium - 427mg. Sorbitol - ???mg.

I've been pretty pissed off that I couldn't really use them since I was under the impression you couldn't CWE effervescent tabs and it's not like I could use them for pain or anything since I have a decently high opioid tolerance.

I did some more research and I've seen a bunch of conflicting info on here and other places about whether you could actually do a CWE with these, so I thought fuck it and I've just given it a try myself.

The method I used was this:

1: Got 20 tabs (160mg codeine / 10g Paracetamol / 600mg Caffeine total) and broke each one in two, placing them in an empty plastic water bottle.

2: Heated some water (not boiling, but would hurt slightly to touch) and gradually added it to the bottle with the tabs until there was just enough so they had all desolved.

3: Put the lid on the bottle and shook the fuck out of it for about 2 minutes.

4: Left it in room temp for about 2 hours. (After this I was already seeing some separation, thick white powder at bottom with clearish liquid on top)

5: Put it in the freezer for 30 mins.

6: Filtered through a wet thick tissue paper.

After all that, it seemed to have gone pretty much the same as any other CWE I've done (I usually use Tylex 30/500 when I have them).

There was a very clear liquid left in the cup I filtered into, with a thick gloopy white substance left on the filter. It didn't look like 10g but it was more than I've ever seen before.

Other than that, the only weird thing was that the liquid that I drank tasted...kind of good? Usually when I drink CWE'd codeine it tastes horrible and I need a chaser immediately, but this had an almost sweet chocolatey aftertaste. It's not something I would choose to drink if it didn't have codeine in it, but it wasn't exactly bad.

I reckon the taste was either due to the Caffeine or Sodium that was left after the CWE, both of which idk if you can even remove.

Anyway, I drank it about 30 mins ago and I'm starting to feel a bit of a feeling creeping up on me, so I guess I'll update this if anything interesting happens. Hope I don't die!",1515724126.0

Mom basically called to say she wants nothing to do with me anymore, of course this was 5 minutes after my session with my therapist. Shortly after, my fiancé who'd I'd been having a lot of problems with..well we broke up. I made the call but she all but forced my hand.

I just chip so it's rare for me to cop two days in a row, and if all goes to plan I'll be getting a stick/log(10 bundles) tomorrow too. I went till ny partner in crimes place, told him about my shit day and asked if he wanted to try to get something. He was up for it but we had no plans worked out and we recently hit one of our go to stores yesterday so that was definitely out. Didn't leave us with a lot of options. I don't like to come out for less than 2 bundles as that's barely enough to get me high for a day.(even though I chip I've always had an unnaturally natural? High tolerance to opiates. 

Anyway, things weren't looking good and I was going to be very surprised if we each went home with the two bundles. I'm not gonna list criminal activity on here but we had a stroke of brilliance hit and we both went home with 4 which is great enough on its own for one day, we could have gotten more but certain places were closing. To put it simply , we don't have to conserve those 4 bundles very much as tomorrow we have enough to split 20 more! And also have money left over for gas and some sorely needed new box of needles(I think I've been reusing the same 50 or so for about 2 months.(yes I know, horrible practice of harm reduction but you do what you gotta when you're poor). So as long as something doesn't get flagged and locked, I can drown myself in 14 bundles over the next few days and have some subs left over for when the shit hits the fan later.

I know this doesn't solve my problems except for a few days but at least I can say fuck off mom and fuck you now ex fiancé for the moment, all the while feeling amazing because we're also lucky enough to have some of the best shit that's been around in months available to us.

How many consecutive days of heroin use til you began to feel withdrawals? if you can remember. By withdrawals, I guess I'm referring to withdrawals that are noticeable, not the symptoms that can be confused with placebo.

2. What dose were you doing when you first started, and what dose when you first felt withdrawal? What was your ROA?

3. I've been using heroin 7 days in a row (a dose of only 15-25mg snorted, gives me strong effects), then I do Kratom for 7 days in a row, and so on. Personally do you think this plan will keep me out of physical dependency (only asking about dependency, not addiction)? I only feel mild depression after the 7 days of dope. And will it keep my tolerance down at 15-25mg? So far I haven't felt the need to increase my dose. I'm not worried about Kratom dependency, I've already been doing it daily for years.

4. What are some signs that you did way too much and need to stop right away so you don't OD?

P.S. I've been through opium withdrawal. I'm quite experienced w/opiates, just not so much with heroin. please don't try and tell me to run from heroin, I'm 1000% aware of how addictive this substance is and that I'm probably spiralling into addiction and that my plan will not work. However, on the very off chance that it might, it would really help if these questions were answered :) thanks! ",1515717316.0

Is it possible to try it once, without using other opiates afterwards or before? Kratom alternative?","So I have around 100mg of heroin from darknet. Before taking it I will have it tested for cuts because it's free to do so where I live and takes about a month.

I have a lot of free prescription concerta (ritalin XR) available but don't use it because I think it has negative health consequences and is habit forming. I could be smoking weed all the time but I smoke only maybe once a month. I don't smoke cigarettes and alcohol is not that interesting to me. I have tried many common stimulants (except cocaine) and psychedelics (except ketamine) and find them interesting them, but don't use them often because of negative health effects and habit formation. You could say I'm a bit on the psychonaut side.

I have never tried any opiates before so my plan was to: 
1. try smoking some heroin, 
2. IV heroin to get the full experience some days/weeks after smoking
3. trow away any heroin left

Negative side effects usually keep me away from doing drugs frequently or at all (MDMA only 4 times a year, don't like the smell of cigarette smoke on me). Do you think I could get away with trying it twice? I've been experimenting with drugs for about 4 years now, I'm 21 and think that I could manage just trying it, but I do like to binge eat sometimes. I already have the H and I've read about opiates online and watched some movies, now I would like to experience the feeling. 

A lot of online posts are about trying H once but then doing other opiates, I would not like to use any other opiates/drugs after this and I am in a fairy stable period in my life. My biggest fear is that I would long for the opiate high for the rest of my life but I doubt that this is reasonable after the first try. Do I long for MDMA? Kinda. Will I do it every few weeks because I could afford to? No, because it has negative consistences (I have MDMA at home as proof of my self control). 

What do you think? Any tips for a newbie? Could I just try kratom instead? I will have someone with me that has tried snorting it but it was a long time ago for her, and she would like to try to IV it in the future. I am in no hurry to try it but I do have it at home, along with a scale with a 1 mg precision and the intention to practice harm reduction. 

Sorry for such a long post but I wanted to be specific. Thank you in advance.

EDIT: I know of SpontaneousH from reddit who wanted to try it once and got addicted ",1515714658.0

Tiny backstory:   Esentially, I was on opiates out of pain necessity since the very young age of 11, stopped after about 10 years, took a one/two year break (due to the issue at hand) and began very recently on suboxone.  

After about 5 or 6 years into my appreciation for ops (oxycodone mainly) I began to have issues going pee on days that I would dose.   This was first heavily noticed on 100mg+ doses of oc, however it is recurrent now on EXTREMELY low doses of Suboxone.   (This info will make more sense later)


THE ISSUE:

I knew i had to go pee as I felt it there/ and i was drinking a normal amount of water, naturally I should have to go.  But I couldn't.  It kinda feels like one of the tubes inside my pecker are being ""choked"" in a sense.  It is mildly comparable to the anxiety of being at a public urinal - however it feels more like an unsucessful mechanical action within my dumb body.     It is not painful really, but it is uncomfortable, generally confusing and makes me very angry.  To add to the strangeness, at times when i smoke weed it feels a tiny amount similar to this, but that feels more like anxiety.   

There is a copious amount of general anxiety within my own body/alienation of my body versus mind - but that's a different story.   Happy to expand if you'd like.

 ....
Part of the strangeness is that today i am taking such a low dose of opiate in comparison to what I used to (when the pee issue was heavy) and it feels very similiar to how it did back then.   I feel a lot of this issue is connected with my rare medical situation/mental health, however the opiate relationship is extreme.    


Does anyone else have any experience at all with issues peeing when dosing?   Any thoughts at all are hugely appreciated.  Thank you so so so so much for your time.  Hugs and happy safe nods.  I love you All.",1515713977.0

Trying to figure out where to go from here...,"I'm only doing this bc I got interventioned so now my whole family knows, and I care enough about them to do this. There's no fuckin' way I'm staying away from opis entirely, though. I've been using opioids on and off for 13 years; I was 13 when I chewed up a handful of hydros, 14 buying morphine 200's off homeless vets, smoking OC80s and BTH and sniffing pharm fent solution at 16. Still never had a problem. Habit got a little worse, still just rare binges, in my early 20's. Then I overdosed and ""quit"". Got back in slowly thru hydros and oxy. Somehow convinced my then-gf who liked to pop pills with me that U-4 was okay, even though heroin was the big no-no. She cried the one time she saw me smoke tar and crack. But she'd do U-4 with me. I did it more, though. Nearly every night for a year. Withdrew every night, and managed to keep my tolerance stable and never got sick on days off. It was almost perfect, except it was destroying my body and I kept turning blue and stopping breathing. I once overdosed on NYE 2015 on U-4 and clonazolam and fell out down a flight of stairs in an old warehouse building. It was a problem so I stopped. Secretly chipped for a few more weeks/months and let my tolerance get out of hand during binges. Stopped again. ""Took a break"" w/ gf eventually bc she couldn't handle my multitude of mental illnesses. Can I really blame her? I had a G of tar in my pocket within 30 minutes of her bringing up the idea, and after a few months of me living in another city smoking heroin alone in the cold and working long shifts we broke up. So I went even harder. Went through a phase where I was living w/ another girl and ended up having to pay for her whole habit for the last couple weeks, shooting goofballs all day every day. 

She left, and I got more U-4. By the end of all this I'd gone through a half ounce of the shit, raw, by myself. My tolerance went through the roof, fast, as I had no one to tell me not to. Eventually, one night, my sinuses were so scabbed and clogged and bloody I couldn't get anymore of the poison into my face. Of course I could have found a way, but I had a moment of clarity, blood pouring out of my face, and I kicked again (that's an interesting story itself).

I've also been addicted to benzos since about 19. I can sort of get by with one or the other daily but not without either. I can get through the sickness. I could tough it out for weeks, months, years maybe even. But I will relapse. And I won't be functional until I do. I know myself, I know my depression and anxiety are too much for me to handle and it's worth dying 50 years early to enjoy 5 more years with the drugs. I've been depressed since I was 6 years old; it's not going away. 

Right now I'm sitting, waiting for my next trip to the bathroom. I took some klonopin, might take some clonidine, been taking some ULDN too to try it out. I can get through these WD's, but it's gonna be hell. I just do not trust myself to make it afterward.

I've decided I want to do maintenance. I guess I could go to the methadone clinic myself tomorrow. My insurance/provider is super tight about bupe, and tbh I'd rather be on 'done than bupe. Everyone tells me getting on methadone would be the worst mistake of my life, but my brain is already fully hooked. I think it was the U-4 that rewired my brain so heavily. I *never* really craved opioids before, beyond a casual enthusiasm for them. After the U-4, it was like I'd never be happy again without the opioids. And I haven't been.

That said, it *does* scare me to commit to a serious sedative like methadone for the foreseeable future/for life. At the same time, it would change everything for me. I know it would allow me to build my life the way I really need to. It would allow me to be optimistic. Nobody will hire me because I ooze depression and anxiety, but on methadone I could really function, I could really become someone.

It's scary, and I don't want to go through another WD if I'm just going to get on maintenance, so I feel like rushed to make the decision. I guess the best course for now is to just endure the WD's and see if by some miracle I can feel semi-ok without any opioids in my system.

Sorry for writing so much, thanks for reading if you did. I'm just really torn atm.

tldr; I've been using for ~13 yrs, 26 now, supposed to be kicking rn and somewhat worried about jumping on maintenance meds but I know I'll relapse if I don't so I probably should huh? I'm also fairly confident about getting off one day if things change.",1515707251.0

I mean, u are physical addict to the specific substance that u use or when you are addicted every opiates is fine (obvirously in a stronger or weaker way) for ""help"" you whit your addiction? Im asking that because my doc said that if i swap my prescribed opiates and dont take always the same one i will problably dont get addicted like i could be if i get only 1 opiates everytime. Is that true? Obviously that whit a regular use but not daily, like 1 or 2 times a week, more frequently i think i will for sure get addicted so i wil not get them more than 2 times a week max(usually less, other days if im in pain i use pregabalin).

This is complete bullshit for several reasons. 

1. Drug use is a choice - all of us chose to take those pills regardless of whether or not we ended up addicted. The consequences are our fault and many people do not get addicted anyways. The media meme of everybody who tries opiates getting addicted is some Nancy Reagan bullshit. 

2. Opiates work wonders for pain that Tylenol and chiropractors do not. It may seem obvious to those on this sub but i see more normies advocating various bullshit treatments like acupuncture to replace opiates. Making it harder to get pills only hurts people who are suffering, whereas degenerate recreational users like myself will get high anyways off something else or obtain the pills anyways. 

3. Opiates are good for the economy - pharmaceutical companies make lots of money, much of which goes to rich ass executives yes... but a lot also goes to taxes that help us all in small but not insignificant ways. Plus pharmaceutical companies create many good jobs not only for scientists but also janitors who clean the offices and truck drivers who deliver the goods. 

4. Painkillers are fucking awesome, so I personally don’t give 2 fucks if some old white dude gets rich off peoples suffering, what do you guys think of the tobacco and gun industries? Alcohol companies? Defense contractors that make drones and missiles that blow up innocent kids in Syria? While pharmaceutical companies are not totally devoid of blame (such as lobbying against weed), they are only doing what they can to protect their business which every company does. 

5. Pills are much safer than heroin. With oxy I know exactly what I’m getting as fake presses are almost always easily identifiable. Making it harder to get scripts only pushes people to heroin which is far more dangerous and unpredictable as far as fent ODs and other bullshit. The heroin business also directly feeds the cartels waging violence on their own people across Latin America. 

 At the end of the day humans consume products for which there is demand, and somebody’s gonna profit off it. So I just want to say thank you science and pharmacologists for inventing pure fun & relaxation, and also pain relief for the suffering in the form of readily consumable pills. Oxy, dilaudid, and opana in particular are some of the greatest innovations in human history. Up there with the telescope and internet in my humble opinion. 

So there you have it people, instead of bitching in lockstep with media hacks and corrupt politicians we should instead be thanking the opioid producing pharma companies for curing our grandmas pain and getting us high.

If yes, any tips on how you managed to do that?

I've always struggled with a gradual increase. I'm trying to fight it by trying to take larger doses but fewer doses, spending more hours each day mildly sick between doses, and only having enough in my system at bedtime to barely be able to sleep through the night without the withdrawal getting intense enough to wake me up too early. Might experiment with adding small amounts of tramadol at times to push the time between doses further.  I made big mistakes before with a lot of redosing, and accidentally taking fentdope for a while which had no legs causing constant redosing.

Also heard dxm might help so I'm trying 5-10mg of that daily. Any thoughts on that? And uldn naltrexone ultra low dose, 20mcg per day. 

And I'm snorting now instead of IV. Theorizing that it has a longer duration so less redosing and thus less tolerance buildup, as well as the lower peak plasma level for a given intensity of high also lessening tolerance development. Budget is a big weapon against further tolerance increase and snorting is more expensive so I'll only be able to afford a smaller tolerance snorting.

I used to inject to save money but then I pushed my tolerance up to my budget limits anyway. Having a psychological barrier against taking out more cash after already doing my monthly drug budget bank withdraw is helpful.

I heard of people having timed safes for dosing, and also not having a debit card , as other ideas.

I hope to taper and quit, but some weeks lately I haven't felt like tapering, after tapering down a bit last month. Just want to try to limit the tolerance damage I'm doing while I'm not tapering.",1515686579.0

Then I started puking and there didn’t seem to be any blood in the puke but whenever I spit up a loogie it was full of blood. This morning I woke up and coughed up another loogie and this time it had a little blood in it still but much less than before and the blood was much darker than yesterday. Now only like 20% if the loogies have a little bit of blood in them so it seems to be going away. 

Does anyone know what may have happened??

Not to mention the SSRI withdrawals are somewhat similar to opiate withdrawals (shakey legs, feeling like shit, flu symptoms etcetc)

I need to know the difference between the two drugs on a SEROTONIN level.

What I currently think I know, Heroin also impacts serotonin, A LOT more then lets say meth or coke, and it also makes you feel more relaxed because of the opiod recepors in the body and whatnot.. 

An SSRI acts much slower and takes weeks and makes you feel like shit for whatever reason and possibly gives zero euphoria etc

Can anybody tell me the difference besides the fast acting effects of heroin on serotonin, and how SSRI's impact serotonin and why people who might take ans SSRI might get depressed, whereas a heroin high will give you a rush?

I'd use at the max a point and probably .2ish of some very decent dope to sleep. Thoughts? Not trying to waste either one and I don't really like just doing speedballs by themselves. I like to nod from H which I have trouble doing with coke in me but if I'm just going to sleep idc about nodding.

For about 16 of those years it was painkillers. Percs, Oxys, whatever I could get my hands on. 
About two years ago I started making real adult money. Expendable income where I could afford to indulge regularly and still put money away and cover all my costs of living. So I was dropping about $100-$200 a week on painkillers. Started off eating 40mg would have me fucking lifted. Like a warm and fuzzy bowl of jello. But, that was a recreational, special occasion habit still at that point. I’d take them only on days off when I had nothing I had to do, and hours to kill watching movies or playing video games. I lived alone so I could get ripped and just float all day long. I’d usually pair up with a bottle of scotch and be swell. After about a year of progression and an increase in frequency, I was usually taking about 15-20mg a day, after I’d get done work, then on days off, I was eating a total of 80-100mg spread throughout the day. Usually take a handful every 4-6 hours.
Then I got “sober”. Stopped drinking. So, I lost that whiskey that would help kick a few pills up a notch so that I’d be straight. That’s when it switched to eating 80-100mg in one sitting to even feel anything. Otherwise, anything less and I’d feel like I wasted my money. I wouldn’t feel high, and I’d just get that like pressure headache. 
Fast forward to about 6 months ago, my financial situation changed and I didn’t have the same kind of expendable income. At that point I was spending about $100-$400 a week on painkillers. I met a connect on the street that was reliable and good to me. I started mixing it up with Xanax and that helped for a while to feel something again. I’d get the nods, but I missed that warm, fuzzy, itchy feeling. 
So, low and behold, going to meet my guy for painkillers, I would always pass the dopeboys peddling their goods. So on a whim one time, I picked up 3 bags. I didn’t know prices, how it was sold, anything. So when my man told me it would be $15, I was pleasantly surprised. I knew dope was cheap, I just didn’t know it was that cheap. So I got it home, and I decided snorting would be my way to go. I definitely wasn’t going to shoot it, and at the time I didn’t know how to go about smoking it or that you even could if it was in powder form and not hard, so I dumped out half a nick bag and snorted it. I waited and waited. Didn’t feel anything. I didn’t know how strong it was at the time so I was being cautious. 
Fast forward to now when I’m much more knowledgeable. I still have never smoked it nor shot it, I still only snort it. However, on a day off when I’m just relaxing and doing my own thing, I’m on par to go through about two bundles a day (28 nick bags), snorting about 2-3 bags at a time. But I don’t even really get that high, that’s just to take the edge off and mellow out a little at this point. If I’m gonna go for a nod, my limit now, just because it’s the furthest I’ve pushed it, is snorting 6 nick bags. 
Now as far as I know, the dope I’m getting are the best bags available on the street, which isn’t necessarily saying much. It’s clean white, and it does the trick, but I’ve still only ever snorted it. 
I’m just getting frustrated because I don’t even feel high anymore, this is just to level off. If I stop snorting, I get super depressed, and usually will feel a little sick on the second and third day, but I’m usually pretty good after that. 

So what I’m asking, is there any hope for me for getting high? Is smoking it worth a shot? If so, ...how? I know the foil method in theory but have never actually done it. Or is there a better method to smoke it? And is it even worth it at this point?
I refuse to shoot it still, so that option is out. I won’t buy pills anymore because they’re just an expensive waste of money, I don’t feel anything. 
Xanax is still ok from time to time, but I usually just nod off on it, whereas I’m trying to get to that warm euphoria where I’m awake and enjoy it. Should I just stop all together and dry out for a while until my tolerance drops and start again down the line? 
Any advice?

**tl;dr** I have a two bundle (28 nick bags) a day dope habit where I’m snorting 2-3 bags at a time and that’s only to get well, not high. The most I’ve snorted at once is 6 nicks. I’ve never smoked it but I’m open to trying. I’ll never shoot it so that’s out of the question. Painkillers do nothing anymore. Do I have any hope of getting high at this rate or should I just quit and start over once I dry out?




Sidenote and funny story, I got in to some trouble and had to go and take a forced drug test. I was doing about a bundle a day at this point. I had actually snorted 3 bags about 5 hours prior to the drug test and was shitting bricks and sweating bullets. Took the test and it came back negative. I have no idea how, but I picked up the bundle I had hidden immediately afterward and snorted 5 bags to celebrate and all was good. Any ideas how that might’ve even happened? I mean it’s definitely dope I’m getting, no question about that. So...?",1515834217.0

Oxy use is out of control. 200mg plus a day. Go through script in a week, then another I acquire, then withdrawals, then wait and repeat.

2 year mark next month. Started with a 7.5 or two after some dental work, then shingles.

Haven't hit rock bottom, I just don't feel good any more but I'm fucking hooked. I have a great family, successful career, great life otherwise. 

I do have a legit pain issue. That's where I'm hitting my head on a wall trying to figure this out. Nerve pain is real and pretty awful, so I have a legit script every month. Lyrica made me hallucinate and gabapentin doesn't do shit. I also overuse Kratom like crazy during withdrawals, then I withdrawal off that and keep using it. Cycle kratom and oxy. Kratom like 30-40g a day when on it.

How the fuck do I stop this? Feb 1 is my goal. I'm gonna be done my script this weekend. With access like I have, how the fuck do I get out? Can't fuck my job up. It's a great 6 figure career that provides for my family and I can't get time off and miss any work right now.

I know some of the answers. But how do I deal with the very real pain? And the constant access? Even if I stop my script, my wife is weaning down after major surgery and will have pain meds around for at least 3 more months. 

I feel very defeated. Went through 500 mg in 2 days, I should be high right now but I can't get there any more. Won't switch to H or anything harder. Refuse to even think of it. I've taken up some new hobbies to try and help.

I'll try tl:dr. Wanna be done, tolerance is fucked, but will be around pain meds for a while and have a legit pain issue. Won't go to anything harder.

For me, being ""clean"" means you're not taking/doing any drugs. You're not drinking, smoking weed, or on a replacement medication.

Not abusing drugs is what I, personally, call ""sober."" For a few months - I want to say five, but it might be closer to six - I haven't abused opiods at all. Before that date there was a few months where I still shot up or whatever, but it was rare - less than once a week.

So these days I strictly take my prescriptions as indicated. I might drink a few times a month, smoke weed even less, and I'll never turn down some pretty white girl. So, obviously, I'm not ""clean,"" but I consider myself ""sober."" To be honest, I'll never be ""clean"" - I'm going to be taking pain killers the rest of my life. Or at least if I want to be able to function. I suppose if I'm okay with never getting out of bed and shitting into a bedpan I could stop taking opiods, but, well - fuck that.

So I'm not abusing any drugs - I'm not getting in the least bit high. I'm not sniffing crushed roxies, I'm not playing with pointy rigs, and I'm not taking more than directed. Hell, I'm not even skipping a dose today so I can take extra tomorrow.

But I still don't want to say I'm ""clean,"" so I say ""sober"" instead.

Does this make sense to anyone else or is it just a stupid linguistic cop-out and I'm still up to old tricks and just lying to myself?",1515806279.0

I’m not passing any judgment on active users. I was pretty deep into my own heroin addiction for a long time, and even though I’m clean now, it hasn’t been for long at all. When I was active in my addiction, it was incredibly dark. Anyway, I posted this over in r/OpiatesRecovery, but I wanted to share it with you guys because I just really like a lot of the people here. I don’t get to talk about my addiction/sobriety with a lot of people. I live far away from my family and friends (and they weren’t truly aware of what was going on!), and didn’t use with anyone other than my husband. It’s really been so refreshing to communicate with people in this sub. I’m really grateful that I discovered this community. Anyway, on to the post:


**54 days clean of heroin, and I just have to say...**

That I don’t miss the game that goes along with it. At ALL. 

I don’t miss being so physically sick. Not being able to get out of bed, vomiting 20 times/day (and pissing myself while vomiting, because of the intensity), not having the energy to clean myself and change clothes (even after said vomiting and pissing myself). 

I don’t miss the severe depression. Waking up every morning and just wanting to die. Wanting to die not just because I didn’t have drugs, but because I was so tired of the drug life and what problems came along with it. The strained relationships with family, friends and my husband. The impact on my self-esteem. The guilt. 

I don’t miss having NO money. I don’t miss having to do dirty things just to get my hands on a couple of bucks. I don’t miss not being able to afford food and pay my bills. 

I don’t miss the dealers. 
“I’ll be there in five minutes.”
45 minutes go by, I’m vomiting in my car, sweating and hurting and crying. The dealer is nowhere to be found. Either he would finally come around, or I would go home empty-handed, sick and even more depressed. Then, later on that night or on the next morning, dboy would *finally* be ready to see me. No matter what time it was or how I was feeling, I was ready to go when he was ready to see me. Like a hopeless little puppy, I succumbed to his bullshit and did what he said - because I needed my drugs. 

I don’t even miss the “high.” Or, should I say, the “feeling of getting somewhat well after withdrawing.” My situation was so hellish that I was using heroin to escape, to temporarily forget about my problems; however, the heroin I was using to forget my problems was just creating even bigger ones and making the old ones even worse. Now that I’m living without heroin in my life, I have fewer problems, and they are more manageable.

For me, the cons of heroin addiction *heavily* outweigh the pros. Even though I have the occasional rough day, and I still deal with depression/bipolar disorder, I know that the life I’m living now is the one I want to continue living. I didn’t have a life when I was using heroin. All I had was heroin, and I’m over that bitch. 

Just some thoughts that popped into my head as I’m going through my day today. As I think about where I’ve been and where I am now, I look forward to my life now. I’m excited for the future. I didn’t want a future when I was using heroin, and I definitely don’t miss that.

Thanks for reading, and I hope everyone is having good days! ",1515800515.0

It bubbles a little on the foil and then runs into the brown colour before going black when it's done, it's supposed to be pure stuff and has the nice vinegar smell, It smokes quite a lot and is a little bit harsh and doesn't really taste like the stuff I've had before, it has a nice effect but just a bit skeptical about it.

Also i know the OP 80’s are fucking horrible for your tolerance and i’m gonna try and stay away from them altogether. If you guys know how to keep your T down when you’re taking just roxies then please let me know. 

anyway if you guys have any tips at all on reducing tolerance rapidly (i can wait to do the oxy if it means i’ll get higher) that would be amazing. i’ll check the sidebar anyway but i just wanted to hear your guys’ opinions and what has worked for you in the past.

I get as high as I did off the first one, every single day. I also have not experienced any signs of physical dependency. Mental dependency is another story, obviously, or I probably wouldn’t do it almost every day. I don’t do any bupe the day I get my vivatrol injection, but later that day or the next day, I’m right back to it. 

Ya ya, I know, why  go on vivatrol if you’re going to keep shooting opiates? Well, it wasn’t my intention. I would hope that just about everyone in this sub can at least understand how these things have a way of just... happening. 
Also, I got off dope to appease my girl. Subs don’t show on the home drug tests she gives me.

I spilled the beans to my family about my problem (which has gotten out of control) and have been given an ultimatum; detox/rehab, or cut out of their life.

I'm all set to enter the county's only free detox/rehab center (for broke people like me) as soon as a bed is available. I know nothing about the place, reviews are scarce though I take it doesn't have a sterling reputation compared to luxury rehab centers. 

I have never done anything like this before, and have no idea what to expect. The literature they gave me makes it sound like a prison. I can't bring anything to read that isn't ""spiritual"" to take my mind off my situation(and my feelings) when I'm bored, but my main worry is what's going to happen when I start to hurt.

For anyone who's done detox before, do you have any advice? What can I expect? How sympathetic are they to the pain and withdrawal symptoms? Will they give me something for the pain and to sedate me and help me sleep? What about for the anxiety? Do I have to request/demand/fight for it? Will I be treated like a prisoner? And assuming I'm not court ordered to be there, can I leave on my own volition? 

Any advice, answers or anything useful at all would be greatly appreciated.

I had a fever for two or three days and my teeth were chattering and my entire body hurt. I went home on my lunch break from work yesterday and randomly decided to take my temperature.

I had a fever of 101.8 so I went to the doctor. I wasn’t positive it was an abcess cause the skin was hard but it wasn’t that warm. I was actually convinced that I had the flu but the doctor told me I didn’t!!

So anyways.. fast forward to 1230 pm and I can’t even bend my god damned arm. I go to the hospital and was just discharged an hour ago. I was there for 8 hours. 

I guess the whole point of this is if you think you could even possibly have an abcess then GO TO THE ER!!! They numbed the area then stuck a needle deep into my arm. They said there was no head on the abcess but I was persistent and they ended up draining about a dime sized hole filled w blood and yellow pus.

I say this cause MANY times I have thought I was abcessed and would go to the ER just to get a stern talking to and sent on my way.. but apparently this time I could have easily went into sepsis. Practice self care!!!",1515939694.0

One time I went on a benzo binge and was blacked out for a week. Completely delusional , fighting with everybody , contemplating suicide. This was way before I found reddit and this sub. I end up calling cops on self and ambulance tell them I want to kill myself ( worst fucking mistake of my life ) but they just did their job and were obligated to take me. I’m over here thinking they are going to help. WRONG !!!! end up going to a hospital two to three towns away about 30 miles from where I live. When there is a hospital only 7 miles away. I’m way passed pissed at this point I understand no one wants to deal with an addict but fuck EMS in my area treat you like the scum of the earth. I had obvious injuries , broken eye socket , swollen ass face , bruises everywhere. I end up at the hospital refuse any treatment not sure why but I was pretty livid. I was high out of my mind why did they let me leave ? Anyways the discharge me and I stay in lobby trying to get people to let me use their phone. No one wanted to fucking help. Finally someone told me if I asked nicely at the desk I would get a bus token. I appreciate this info but I was fucking 30 minutes away from home and no bus will drive that far. I still have this token haha. Someone eventually told security and the escorted me out. I refused to leave so they called the cops. I’m not sure what they were going to do so I just walk opposite direction. Eventually I just stop and talk to them I was nice to them because I was pretty beat up already and I didn’t want to have to fight two cops. They ask if they can search me and they find a rig on me , no black because it had fallen out of a hole in my pocket thank god , two grams of wax and some loose bills because earlier that day I had scammmed my uncle out of $200 and asked boss for $200 in advance. It all went to xanax and BTH. I gave $50 to friend for keeping his mouth shut to help me scam unk he ended up snitching me out. We are not friends anymore but my uncle understood and didn’t ask me to pay him back. But anyways the cops find this I’m not sure why they detained me but they did and I ended up saying “ if you arrest me I will kill myself “ again do not say this to a cop !!! He immediately said “ are you sure you want to say this “ being dumb as I am I said yes. I get handcuffed and try to convince the officer not to take me to jail. He was silent the whole time. That fucker drove me even farther to a psych ward and by this point I was super fucking livid blood boiling !!! The xan rage hit so hard I was a xan hulk. Fighting cops , security, and nurses. They ended up tranquilizing me. Strap me to my bed I don’t think it was strong enough I woke up a few times and thought I was at home. When I wake up I find out I’m on 51/50 watch , not knowing where I am , felt like I died and got stuck in purgatory. I was there for about a week and I’m lucky I got out. I had to call a lawyer. They were trying to keep me in their for a month. I met some cool people. A professor, couple veterans , and some people who admitted themselves for detox. All I did was watch TV all day. All you could do. You could only talk the doc once a day she came in at 8 am everyday. She ended up giving me klonipin and I ended up snorting it with a buddy I had in there. My roommate layed in bed all day he was recovering from a meth binge. Everyone had to wear green scrubs and these socks with grip at the bottom. They tired to get me on depression meds but I never took them. I felt like they forced me to be happy. I felt like whatever I said didn’t matter because I was labeled crazy. Fuck those places and fuck shitty nurses. Like I said no one wants to deal with an addict but for fuck sake have some compassion. ",1515926511.0

(X-post /r/suicidewatch)","As in, they're so obvious about it that they'll ignore every message asking to hang out but freak out if I'm a bit late to get their weed. Most of them just want weed, although one of them I think enjoys straight up psychologically fucking people, and she's great at it. She at one point got a group of 3 people to gang up on me because her girlfriend had suggested we go to a bar and I said ""as long as (X) is ok with that). Which is what I would have done to a hetero/non-trans couple, but apparently it was a HUGE misstep because she still doesn't talk to me the same. I should stress that she was watching the conversation unfold and we were literally just saying ""Val speak up would it be OK you can end this now"" -_- she must get off on it.

I don't know what to do. I know they're just using me and they know it too, but as they've even mentioned before, I have nowhere else to turn to. Even my parents have flat out told me they don't love me.

So. In a world where my ""friends"" leverage that ""friendship"" over me for whatever they please, how am I meant to escape that clearly toxic situation? It's not like I can just go to the friend shop and pick up the new manipulation-free model.

I guess my question would be, where do you find quality friends? People who see you as someone to help instead of an asset? I've never been suicidal when I had an SO because I knew I was brightening someone's life, now... I'm basically just an emotional plaything.

I've tried church (although I'm not religious and their dedication to converting me definitely showed), smoking outside concerts and raves (I don't smoke and am aware of the health risks but I'm desperate, until my ""friends"" find me and drown me out of the conversation this has been the most effective), and just meeting people from the internet and making sure no one knows.

I'm sure one of you must have been in this situation before. Where can I find a legitimate, non-sociopathic human being? I just want one friend that's all, even if it's just someone here I can talk to on Skype. Just something yknow?

I bought dope with Cliff this week and it went well. I wasn't notaicably scammed or robbed. 


Yesterday was interesting, I was at the end of my supply but confident I wouldn't get sick. While still under the influence of dope, I started feeling stranger to the negative end of the spectrum. WHen I'm high doses of dope for an exctended period of time, I get weird dream flashes. Well apparently, these happen stronger and earlier in the evening when coupled with more sleep depredation.

Just dark flash-backs and daydreams in the middle of doing the usual goofing around, movies, talking about movies, and the sciences. Especially when engaged in the sciences. Fit for a more detailed post of it's own.

&nbsp;

All of the previously mentioned aside, I've answered cliff minimally. He texted like four times practically begging for a phone call in one. I was thinking, thinking and asked about him getting subs from his boy as planned and stated by him days earlier. Upon asking about such things.. he did text once about ""good news"" but now he's not saying in text form what the good news is. Nothing of what I asked him just more requests for my ear. 


He finally texted that he didn't care if I answered, ""can you stop off on your way home, PLEASE. **This will help you as well!** 

&nbsp;?


Oh why, oh why? Why can't I just be told what scheme is being cooked up. There is obviously some bullshit available to be had if I were to **go out of my way** and stop by his house to have a conversation + waste time doing nothing watching movies or tv. Doing nothing is fine if that's what I want to do but I reserve the right to do nothing anywhere else that I see fit.

Why can't he just tell me why he needs to talk so urgently. If it was so urgent it would involve answers to my questions and some informative details. 


Usually when someone wants you to answer the phone without saying why, it is because they want to ask you to do something. In this case to do or to sacrifice something. 


That sacrafice is time, effort and money or a combination of the three. Time equates to reduced relaxation or less ""me"" time. Typically coupled with a task.

&nbsp;

If I had 0 subs right now sas opposed to a few days supply l, then I'd be down. I'd jump at the opportunity to go to the atm on Cliff's behalf so he'd have money for dope and would throw me a couple of bags. Before he knew me he'd have to find an addict who drives or take a cab, or take a walk to use his atm card.

I'm guessing he wants me to take his card to the atm to help him pull out the last of his dope money, get scraps and maybe part with my last $50 to $80. If I came to ""talk"" I could easily avoid losing my own money but by showing up I'd increase the likelyhood of being duped into running a physical errand.
?.
Just say no? If he think's I'm not home he can't show up at my house to break my peace nor can he if I'm not home and not at his home, elsewhere. How can I say now on the texter now without knowing to what I'm saying no.


&nbsp;

I started writing this on and off over an hour ago. He just sent me a text over an hour after his last. He reiterated his previous text more succinctly. ""is that ok ? u can stop in when you get back to home street?""


Then another follow-up message more recently, an hour after the prior (had this post drafted and waited to post0:

""very important.."" A longer message, well two more messages but all emphasizing how important it is we speak and that it'll only bee 1-2 minutes. Before he said 2-3 minutes. Even if it was 2-3 minutes, it would end up being 10-20 minutes in real life.

Oh I still wonder what it could be so important and beneficial for me.

**Update:**

Cliff promised via his last text, or at least said: 

**""It's about buns/blue/subs. I'm sure you're near empty, I can help you if you ever answer""**

I wanna just answer, I'm good but I also prefer he don't know I'm sitting on any amount of subs. 

If I was without subs maybe I'd be more attentive. Nonetheless, I already texted indicating my interest in subs. I don't care about those other things at this point and they're probably empty promises involving a who lot of work from me.

&nbsp;


#short version

My presence is being requested, I'm practically getting texted in a desperate manner. My most recent text was ""I'm sure you are home by now""

Basically even tho the sale pitch says the outcome of talking to him would be good for me, I have a feeling he's gonna push some kind of sales pitch and give me a hard time taking no an for answer just as he is persistent right now in texting me.

**Follow up:**
He creepily texted me late last night, ""you must be home by now"" then in the morning texted me to ""text me when you wake up"". 


In the past, or if I was dry I'd be willing to bike to the ATM in sub-freezing weather to help get money off of Cliff's ATM card so he could get dope and throw me a small reward. 

He really thinks he can ask me to hustle to the ATM (his card) before work because it worked in the past. This is probably one of the reasons he always lies about getting subs, he knows if I actually had a meaningful amount of subs it would prove difficult to get me to run errands for him.

I was thinking sublingual would be a decent route but the bioavailability via that route is pretty low 30% via that route. I looked on Bluelight and people have talked about extracting the buprenorphine from the patches by cutting them up into pieces and soaking them in water or alcohol for a few hours or days to get all the buprenorphine out and use the solution for IV use although the monkey water method should also work in theory if one doesn't like needles, does anyone have experience with those extraction techniques?

Once we got to the train, the cartel boyz told us which ally was our turn. Once we got to the front, Mohammad jumps out of the front seat to go cop his tasty treats. Little did I know, that this pile of shit, Mohammad, had only half of the amount that they expected. So I’m sitting in the driver seat minding my own business when I see him start taking off this watch and then they pulled him into the Durango. As this is going down I’m freaked out because I didn’t fuck with these guys and another car pulls up behind me but just sat there staring at my car. It was another set of Mexicans so I thought for sure I was about to get robbed, kidnapped or killed. After 5 minuets goes by Mohammad jumps out of the Durango with a FAT ASS BLACK EYE and a bloody nose & no watch. He jumps into my car freaked out obviously, we sat there until the lead whip pulled out.
As we get onto the highway, I freaked out on him for pulling shady ass shit and asked for my $20 for gas. He’s silent most of the way home and never told me what they said to him but once we got back he tossed me a ballon!!! He said they gave him 3 total which woulda been a 1.5 
So Mohammad got beat up, yet he managed to still get the good stuff. Mohammad never got a ride again.... I still look back at this and wonder why I didn’t ask for the gas before going but I wonder even more about why they still gave him anything? Maybe because they are good dudes or just know he’d keep coming back no matter what?

so I have a opiate dependency, my favoured ROA is snorting H. But I've injected it a few times before tho and I have some questions about doing it correctly for harm reduction.
I know the best thing would be not do it, but I don't need to hear that. I'm doing it anyway and just want some info so I don't fuck it up completely. Thanks.

So I've taught it all to myself as good as I could with online information. Stupid, I know, but I don't really care and yea it's been a lot trial and error.

So I take the heroin powder and put it on a spoon with some water and some like, citric acid (not sure what's it called in English). Well anyway some kind of acid bc apparently you need that bc the Heroin is not completely water solulable, but idk, I've heard different things online.
But the stuff around here (brown rocks/powder) definitely needs acid, favourable ascorbic acid, that's what I've read everywhere. I don't have any ascorbic acid unfortunately but the stuff I have is supposed to work too and it's not like I'm shooting up several times a day so it would become really dangerous with the stuff I put in there but just like, once in a while when I have so little left it wouldn't do anything when I sniffed it or whatever.
Like, over the time I've used it (p much 1 year now) I maybe injected maybe 8 times in total.

Then I stir and heat it up and it turns into a brown/golden liquid with some solid part that floats on the top.
Since you're supposed to suck it up through a filter the solids obviously don't go up the syringe. The liquid in the syringe is sort of a golden/brown colour and when I inject it it definitely has an effect. But I do wonder about all the stuff that's been left behind.

Is that just trash that the heroin has been cut with and goes into the bin?
Or didn't all the heroin dissolve in water bc I didn't use enough acid or didn't heat it up long enough idk?

Would appreciate some advice.
Thanks!!

I’m gonna know most everyone there, I work with them and all, though there will be a few significant others there I don’t know but my problem is fourfold: 1- this will be a social event/environment, not a work one so it’s not the same as usual. 2- there will be a few people there I don’t know. 3- there’s gonna be ALOT of people there and that’s gonna be overwhelming. 4- the woman I’m in love with is gonna be there presumably with her husband and that’s the biggest single trigger. I do know him but it’s always nerve wracking when I meet him. I bring all this up cause last year I took a pill to calm down but it didn’t help that much; this year I intend to take two 10mg hydros and 1mg xanax to deal with it. My question is if y’all think this will do the trick. My tolerance is 50mg to get high and that’s with proper potentiation (but not with Xanax). I’m just looking to feel comfortable around all these people, not get high af. Just relaxed and easy going. Do you think combined with the Xanax I’ll be good? 1mg xanax usually calms me down pretty well but I want to enjoy the evening too so I’m taking the hydro, otherwise I would be calm but miserable. I know this isn’t the best way to deal with anxiety long term and honestly if He wasn’t gonna be there I would probably just take the Xanax but you know. Anyways, any help would be appreciated, thx. 

Update: well the party was a success lol. Managed to have fun, mostly avoided Him and Her but not awkwardly, we just were hanging out with different groups really. Took .5mg/30mg xanax/hydro plus a few beers and felt very relaxed and easy going. Could have probably hung with the two of them but it just happened out differently. Just a little bit of a downer seeing them kiss at one point but that’s just the hand I’ve been dealt. Took 50mg of hydro with potentiation when I got home and am chilling hard. Gonna go to bed and try and be productive tomorrow. I’m gonna put serious effort into finding a new job over the next few weeks; I talked to a guy who got me interested in trying out security work. It might be right up my alley, at least for now. Thx for the responses and everything. ",1515882754.0

STORY!!‼️
(I ramble quite a bit when I’m high PLUS I have ZERO friends who use. Thus, my fam here are the only peeps I have to share such shit with.) 😬😬


Hello, my fellow dope f(r)iends! I hope everyone is happy and safe and high tonight/today! 😎 To start this post off, I’m gonna give ya’ll a little bit of back story on myself. (I do apologize if a “little” turns into “a lot” as I tend to ramble when I’m rocked, as I’ve already mentioned. Haha.) 😁

Anyway, so I’ve been trying my “best” to live clean and sober over the past 4-5 months. But as yinz guys know (haha... 😉).... shit’s fuckin’ tough. In an attempt to keep me clean, my parents have revoked my driving privileges.  I’m an adult, however I currently live under their roof. Also, not having a vehicle is a HUGE deterrent for me when it comes to using. So, I’m not completely opposed to it as I’m truly trying to get clean. (Not that I haven’t found a couple ways around it though, buuuuut they’re both very risky and I sincerely try not to use them much at all.) I suppose that I should also let you guys know that I’m not ALWAYS this lucky with the law (which I’ll get into shortly) and I do have a couple pending drug charges. 😕 I think that’s all the background really needed (aaaand probably then some... hey... I warned you... hahaha.) so I’ll begin my story now about my brush with the ol’ 5-OH.

Okay, so this happened to me about a week or so ago. As I already stated, I don’t currently have a vehicle. But I was feeling especially desperate for a bit of a fix AND I didn’t have enough money to get my d-boy to make the two hour round-trip for him to come to me. (Plus the last time he made a delivery to me it was a smallish “order” AND I accidentally shorted him about $15, which was never even spoken of. Yeah... he’s pretty fuckin’ rad.) SO, this left me with my only other option, which was jacking one of my folk’s cars in the middle of the night. (Yeah, I fucking suck as a human, I know.) Which is NOT an easy task and is also quite risky for me. (God forbid anything happen to the vehicle while I had it because I would be grade-A fucked in that case. Same goes for getting a ticket.)

Soooo, as you can imagine, I was trying to make the (2 hour round-) trip as speedy as possible, while also trying my best to be quite careful. Fortunately, the trip to meet my mans went off without a hitch and I actually made it to him in 45 minutes, as opposed to the nmvg, AND had zero issues. My d-boy was quite prompt (per usual), and after stopping to get some gas, I was on my way home! Aaaand this is where I fucked up. 

After my extremely successful trip to meet my mans n’at, I got cocky. I was also still in a rush to get home so that neither of my folks would be any the wiser that I’d made a break for it in the middle of the night. So, as I’m going about 80 in a 55, I decided that THAT would be the perfect time to send my d-boy a giant, heartfelt, “thank you for being the fucking MAN” text. (DON’T TEXT AND DRIVE, KIDS! It’s dangerous and straight-up moronic.) So as I’m pulling this brilliant fucking move, BAM! Berries and cherries. Mother. Fucker.

Sooo, I’m going 78 (as it turns out) in a 55, I’m texting, I apparently crossed over into the passing lane and then back into mine, AND in my cup holder I have, roughly, 2.5 buns and 6 or 7 empty stamp bags. I. Am. Fucked. As I’m being pulled over, I grab the dope and the empties and shove them in my sweater pocket. All I can think is that I am SO fucking fucked. Fuck. 

- [ ] Anyway, the officer comes up to my window, asks for my paperwork and what-not, informs me of why he and his partner pulled me over, and then asks where I was headed and if I had anything to drink. Trying my best to seem like a good person, I told him that I hadn’t been drinking (true) and that I’d run into the city to pick my drunk friends up from the bar and deliver them safely home, which I had just done, and was now on MY way home (lie. lie. fucking lie.). At this point, due to my erratic driving, he decides to check my eyes with his flashlight. Fuck. Upon seeing that SOMETHING was up, he asked me again if I was sure that I hadn’t had anything to drink at all. So, then I thought, well, shit, if I say “no” again he’s gonna start suspecting that I’m up to something else. So I said “Oh, actually officer, I forgot that I did have 1 drink after I got off of work and before I came down to get my friends. Then he, politely, asked me to step out of the car. Fucking fuck.

At this point I’m thinking, okay, what if he decides to pat me down and I have this dope in my pocket? No bueno. So, even though it may look weird, I need to take my sweater off. (Now, it’s been -7 To about 5 degrees here most days, especially at night. However, thank the LORD this happened to be a very random evening where it was unseasonably warm.) So even though it still may have looked odd, I had to ditch that pocket full of sunshine. Aaaaand, as I slipped my sweater off, sat it on the seat beside me, and got out of my car... he thought nothing of it. Thank you, Jesus.

Sooo, at this point, as his partner finished up running all of my info, he administers a field sobriety test on me. And then, since I “lied to him/forgot” about having a drink earlier, he gave me a breathalyzer as well. Now, obviously, I blew a 0.00. But at this point I’m still thinking that there are many ways that this could go AND that I’m probably still fucked. HARD.

And then the most magical words in all the land escaped his mouth... “Okay, bud. Slow it down, stay off your phone, and please be careful on your way home.” And that was it! No ticket, no warning, no nothing. If he would’ve let me, I would have dropped to my knees right then and there (on the side of a 4 lane highway at 1:00 am, in the dead of winter) and given him and his partner the best head either one of them has ever had. (I hate to toot my own horn. But I don’t have a lot going for me aside from the fact that I’m fairly cute and that I give truly incredible BJs. Especially to good looking, honest to God straight [just very horny] dudes. Many a straight bro has truly had his mind blown, amongst other things, during the process of me doin’ my thing down there. Haha. Sorry. That was a hella random tangent on how awesome I am at fellatio. LOL. My B, yo! I told yinz guys that I’m a rambler. Hahahaha.)

Okay. WOW. That was fucking LONG. So, to the one or two of you who actually read through all of this (For whatever reason. Perhaps you’re a patron saint? Haha.) Thank you SO much! I apologize AGAIN for the MONSTER LENGTH. (That’s what he said? LOL.) And I hope you at least somewhat enjoyed my story/storytelling technique. 🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂

ANYWAY, what about you guys? What magical experiences of running into the po-po, where you definitely should’ve been busted for at least paraphernalia, did you miraculously escape? Feel free to be better at condensing than I. Or ramble on like an asshole motherfucker in the same vein as my gay ass. Hahaha. Either way, I’d love to hear some of ya’lls experiences!!! 😘😍

TLDR: I got pulled over for driving erratically after doing some dope-ski AND while having the remaining dope-ski on my person/in the car. So I lied and said I had had 1 alcoholic beverage earlier and had just DDed my drunk friends home. I was then administered a field sobriety test and a breathalyzer and was then sent on my merry way with a smile and a “drive safe”. How’s about you’se guys? I’m sure ya’ll have some gooooood ones! Haha. 😍

❤️ BE SAFE OUT THERE AND MUCH LOVE TO YA’LL, FAM!! ❤️

literally a nightmare, if i wasnt for kratom i would have jumped off a bridge. i SHOULD be getting my pay check tomorrow and copping like 3 buns and if i dont im going to have a full on freak out.

i cant believe i went on an 8 hour adventure and lost 80 bux for nothing, it was a serious learning lesson that im never letting happen ever again. every single time you meet new people you HAVE to try before you buy. if they say no dont buy it.

I've noticed that for me, and the consensus among others in my circle, that only a fraction of our normal daily habit is required to keep from being in bad withdrawals. Compared to many, my dope habit is not that bad, but I want to try to slowly taper downwardss. Currently I am doing about 2 or 3 points (two to three x 0.1g of black tar) a day. 

I actually have prescriptions to clonidine, gabapentin, klonopin, seroquel and doxepin for horrible insomnia as well as Tourettes and anxiety/panic attacks, and all these are helpful in fighting WDs. 

I used to have access to suboxone films, but am not sure if I will be able to get more. Last year I was able to successfully quit with just 5 suboxone, starting at 1/3 of a strip and tapering down over a two week period. Surprisingly it was relatively painless. Needless to say I relapsed, but had a couple bottles of liquid hydrocodone that I used to taper, again successfully (started at 10 mg 2 or 3 times a day and lowered every two or three days). I relapsed again but don't have access to any of the above.

I have noticed that if I turn the tar into powder to snort, I can make it through a whole 24 hours without doing as much as my normal daily habit, and without the 100% IV bioavailability.

I'm considering giving it a shot to actually attempt to use heroin to taper off of heroin, but have no delusions that it will be easy. But if 10 mg two or three times a day got me to the point where I wasn't 100% yet wasn't in full blown withdrawals (I could get 6 hours of sleep still) then smaller doses of H snorted during the day should work as well I believe.

I'm just wondering, for you guys what percentage or fraction of your normal doses is required to keep the WDs manageable? My buddies all agree that sometimes even 1/5 or less will do the trick. Just looking for some other input. Thanks in advance!! ",1515997411.0

**So you want to snort heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* a clean surface

* a card, razor or other cutting device

* optional: scale

* optional: water, preferably sterile

**Dose**

With little to no tolerance, start with a match head sized bump. Redose every 10-15mins until you're at a level comfortable for you. If you click better with numbers, 2mg is a good place to start, too. Keep adding 1.5-2mg every 10 minutes until you get to a level you like.

**How to**

* Put a small amount of dope on your clean surface

* Cut it into a small bump, or a measured bump

* Blow all of the air out of your chest

* Gently sniff one bump into your nostril, don't sneeze, you're going to want to

* Pour a tiny bit of water in you hand or in the bottom of a bottle cap

* Tilt your head and drip the water down your nose. Sniff until you can taste the drip a little. You don't want a TON. Just a little. Pretty much only do this if your nose is dry or nothing has hit you after 10-15mins.

* Repeat until high

---

**So you want to shoot heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* a metal spoon/ladle/can bottom

* sterile/cool boiled water

* cotton

* cutting device

* a 28-31g needle (higher the better)

* 1cc syringe

* tourniquet (shoelace, latex, phone cord)

* lighter**

* citric acid**

* optional: scale

* optional: alcohol wipe


**Dose**

With little to no tolerance, I'd advise that you do NOT start here. However, make sure your dope isn't cut with fent first and foremost. Start with 3mg. This isn't going to be amazing, it's to be safe. If you can't spare two shots, you shouldn't be shooting. You can always add. If you only have one rig: 8mg max no tolerance.

**How to**

* Cut how much and put it in your spoon

* Mix with water and wait for mixture to blend, stir a little

* If you have heroin #3 (Afghan, brown), you need citric acid and a flame to make a solution. Add citric to your spoon and heat it up. Stir.**

* Put cotton in spoon

* Look for the hole in the needle. Point it down toward the bottom of the spoon, place it on top of your cotton and draw. (This filters your solution)

* Wash those hands and your arm, or try to sanitize the best you can

* Tie off your arm -- don't knot it, wrap it around and hold it in place with your teeth

* Feel for a good vein, always closest to the crook of your arm. Look for ones you can see through the skin clearly.

* Enter the vein, hole facing up, needle pointing towards your shoulder, almost parallel to the arm, you'll know when you're in

* Register: pull back and watch the little bit of blood enter the barrel 

* Note: if there's PAIN at any point or no blood registering, pull out and try again with a different needle. NEVER REUSE A NEEDLE.

* Slam that shit (gently and slowly press the plunger down). With the needle still in your arm, let go of your tourniquet

* Pull out, gently and slowly. It will sting. Wipe your arm, cap your needle.

Good information right here: http://harmreduction.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/getting-off-right.pdf

So you want to ~~boof~~ put heroin in your ass? 

**You will need**

* heroin

* an ass

* oral syringe 

* sterile water

* cotton

* lighter**

* citric acid**

* optional: lube

* optional: scale

**Dose**

Fair warning that boofing is actually strong as fuck. With no tolerance, I would start at 40mg. Not entirely sure on this number as it's a little on the safe side.

**How to**

* Follow previous shooting steps. Mix your solution, filter it and draw it up.

* Without an oral syringe, you can use a regular needle syringe. Break the tip off.

* Lube up the tip

* Slide it in your bung hole and press the plunger down

* Pull out and lay on your side or stomach for half an hour

---

**So you want to smoke heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* a short straw

* foil

* lighter

**Dose**

You can't smoke ECP (well, you can, but it's a waste). Only tar and gunpowder. You also need to breathe on gunpowder to make it tar, so you can really only smoke tar. No tolerance, half a pea size ball.

**How to**

* Tear a strip of foil and fold it in half, tear it in half

* Take one half and make v shape boat thing

* Heat the sides of the foil with your lighter

* Put BTH in the foil, farthest from the corner you're holding it with and closest to your mouth

* Position lighter several inches under foil, away from the dope. You don't want them to touch, you don't want to ignite the dope. Keep your straw close to ball but don't suck it up

* Inch closer to the dope while heating it, it will liquefy and become smoke. Suck that smoke down, don't make the dope too hot and move the lighter away when the flame dies

This shit takes practice, not gonna lie. I've seen it smoked a ton but never done it, mostly because I suck at it!

Some lingo and wise words.

Afghan, #3, brown - all the same shit. Powdery heroin that's beige.

ECP, #4 - whitish powder not cut with fent. Can be grayish and sometimes even a very very light brown depending on where it's from. Almost never pure white, don't trust that shit.

BTH - black tar, it's, well, black. 

China white - don't fucking buy this if you're a newb. 90% of the time it's got fent. Which will kill you.

Always practice harm reduction. Never use needles twice. Never share. Use the guides and the health information. Always have Narcan on hand. If your state has a needle exchange, use it. If your state doesn't have a needle law, use the pharmacy. If not, go to the exchange. Ask on reddit, there's tons of us that have spares. Buy them on the dark net. Ask your dboy. Anything. Just stay safe, and don't be stupid, especially with this shit.

And please, if you're starstruck with the glitz and glamor of us heroin addicts, enjoy it from afar. It's hell.

Never told me about the repercussions of long term use. 

I have been on subs for 3 years now for a ""security blanket"". It was nice knowing that if i found any pills they wouldn't work, besides H that is. 

I was never told how bad long term sub use was, how long it takes to get off it, how it increases depression, makes you moody as fuck, kills your energy and drive, screws with social skills, and kills sex drive. I literally replaced one addiction with another. I always thought that's just the person ive become and didn't think my sub use had anything to do with it

Even though i used sub as a security blanket i still relapsed, went a year and a half before the first relapse, binged for 4 months and got sober for some time (6+ months, stopped keeping track after 6). Then low and behold i recently relapsed again for a week or 2. Now sober again and back on sub, 

I recently learned how bad it was that i was on sub for so long, now I'm tapering down very slowly, I'm a complete bitch when it comes to WDs so I'm tapering with extreme caution.

To give an idea i was on 4-6 mgs for 3+ years, sometimes going down to 2-4mg but mainly i would lower my dose for a week so i would get a small buzz from it, for lack of better words i was sober but not sober. Yea i wasn't doing dope anymore but still trying to abuse subs, wasn't fully committed to being and staying sober.

After this recent relapse i told myself enough is enough and truly want to be clean from it all, this time I'm doing it for myself, not for family or friends (never works). So now I'm starting my extremly slow taper to get off sub and live the sober life, the ""security blanket"" never worked because i had no will power. If i had the chance to get high id take it. 

For me i need to strengthen my will power, i still have my dealers #s, its to show that i can get high whenever i want to. And that i can't run away from my addiction, i need to face it straight on. Its the only way i can beat this i think. I started making a lot of changes in my life since that last relapse, re evaluating what my triggers/cravings are or come from, what makes me depressed and what triggers my anxiety attacks. I'm trying to become the master of my emotions and self, finding who i am and working on becoming the person ive always wanted to be. I know its going to be very hard. But I'm tired of letting addiction control my life in one way or another. I want to be free.

If you took the time to read this i just want to say thankyou for reading, i really needed somewhere to vent.

And if you are in a long term sub use program i highly recommend tapering off it. It did nothing good for me, but if it works for you then keep doing what works, but it never worked for me and other people. 

Anyways you guys are amazing and i hope you all have a wonderful rest of the day! 

Ill update when I'm fully off the subs, wish me luck! 

Take care everyone!

I can't stay clean to save my motherfuckin life. I've had 2 back surgeries and I'm 23. I'm lucky to have had the resources and doctors I have had, but there is no completely undoing this injury.

Maybe my parents are right and I'm pure bullshit. But everything in this world is some flavor of bullshit or another. 

They think 12 step meetings and getting a sponsor will solve all my problems. I know they'll help, but talking to somebody about my pain doesn't make me feel a damn bit better. Opiates do that for me. Which is why I'm useless at staying clean.

It's like this injury was the random chance event that led me to get in bed with opiates. It's like an abusive, hellish ex. Now that we're apart I have nothing without opiates. And all I want to do is to go back.

I'm in the UK and found a reputable online pharmacy / doctor service that offers a ""Low Testosterone Test"" for £30. If others would be interested in getting bloods done, I'd be up for it. I might get mine checked regardless but it would be good to have others take part.",1515947586.0
