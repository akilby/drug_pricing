I've been doing the same batch for about a week or so and it's really good dope. I know for sure that it's not bunk or trash because, well, it gets me high as hell haha. 

Sometimes it doesn't pin my pupils, though. Or it will make them smaller, but not pinned. That's usually how I determine if a new batch is good or not. But this is weird because I'll get high as hell but my pupils won't be pinned. 

Are pinned pupils always a thing , or can you still have good dope without having pinned pupils ? I know the high isn't placebo because I nod out if I do enough. Can the lighting affect it? like I had just done a few bags and 20 min later went into a McDonald's which is really bright then went back into my car which was really dark and noticed my pupils were pretty big. Maybe I'm overthinking it? I'm just curious because this has happened with other batches too... Fire dope but my pupils wouldn't be tiny. Other times they would. But I've noticed lately that my buddy's eyes will get super pinned off of the same batch and we have the same tolerance. He has light eyes and I have darker brown eyes. 

Anyone have any input?  ",1531884819.0

is it in my head or am i very dependant on the small amounts? i looked at a opiod equivalency chart and 0.1mg of subutex= 8mg morphine

Sorry if this is formatted weird I am on mobile. 

1: if I pull back and there is no blood, that means I am not in a vein and need to try again correct? And if I pull back and blood comes that means I’m in a vein and good to plunge, correct? Someone told me if I pull it back and there’s dark blood I missed and need light blood but every time my buddy did it it was dark and it worked every time. 

2: roughly how many ML of water should I use per small $5 bag? Say I just want to do one, how much water would I put in?

3: I hit myself earlier with some coke and was told my ears were gonna be ringing and everything else and I pulled back and there was blood and plunged and didn’t feel anything close to what they said. Did I do something wrong?

4: I’ve hit myself with dope 2 times now and both times never felt anything close to like when my buddy did it but blood came out both times. The shit isn’t as good as when my buddy did it but I still at least thought I would feel something.

The plunger wasn't even completely pushed in and I looked at my friend and said ""I already feel this"". She knew something was wrong. She watched me for mere seconds before I fell out. I convulsed and she heard the death rattle. Then there was nothing. She had the Narcan in her hand administering it and hoping it would work. Hoping she could bring me back. I didn't come back. I turned blue as she checked for a pulse, for a breath, for anything. She started screaming as she reached for the second narcan. Shoving it in my nose as tears ran down her face. She thought she heard a breath so she ran to wake my bf up. The opened the door to me dead on the floor. An image my bf will never shake from his memories. He began compressions while calling 911. The police and emt's arrived and began trying desperately to save my life. To bring me back from the empty void. Suddenly I sat up. I looked at the faces of my bf, my best friend, a cop, and two emts. They had a look of utter shock and confusion on their faces. Not one person in the room thought I was coming back. In the ambulance my blood pressure had sky rocketed to 262/160, so they began spraying nitro spray into my mouth. Once...twice...three times. My head felt like someone had used a sledgehammer to break through my skull to my brain. It's the Narcan and the nitro they said. ""We have to bring your blood pressure down before you have a heart attack"" the soft faced emt said. The realization that I had died had not hit me yet. That was due to the pounding in my head that was unlike anything I've ever felt. As they wheeled me into the e.r., drs and nurses surrounded me. Shoving needles into my arm and barking orders. A c.t. of my brain, a chest xray, a heart monitor, blood work stat. I was ok. I survived. I came back. For days afterwards I was sore from the compressions and manhandling done by my bf as tears streamed down his face and he begged ""please don't leave me...please come back...I love you...please fight this"". I don't remember the time I was gone. It was just black and empty. The people who saved my life are left traumatized by what the witnessed. My bf won't step foot into the room where it all happened. He may never forget opening that door and seeing me dead on the floor. My best friend may never forget frantically administering Narcan to me twice and begging for it to work. 3 lives changed forever in the matter of minutes. I will never do this again. I will never hurt people I love like this again. I will never risk my children having to walk this earth saying ""my mother overdosed on Fent/heroin"". I'm just so sorry. I'm so sorry for anyone who has ever been in any of these situations. I'm sorry for the friend/relative/sig.other who has had to beg and plead for someone they love to just breathe. Nobody deserves to have to go through this. Nobody deserves to feel guilty when they can't bring them back. Nobody deserves to watch you die over one push of the plunger. This was my second time.

I really can't see any reason to *not* pursue this, except of course my deep hatred of the pharma-insurance racket and eventual hassle kicking if I abuse em.

Anybody have experience with any version of subs for chronic pain and or depression? From what I can glean, possibly 0.5 to 2mg might work really well.

I am now reading people recommend using less water and not too much water, they suggest anywhere from 75ml to 150ml. They say the more water the more paracetamol will dissolve in it. Already fucked it up.

So I put it in the freezer for about 30min and then the fridge for about 35-40min. It was quite cold and I saw a good deal of kinda mushy/sorta marshmellow-y white stuff crystallized on the bottom. I had it cooling for a little over an hour in the freezer/fridge because I was aware I used too much water and I heard you should let it sit longer then - just nobody said how much longer. During my first filter I saw a healthy amount caught in the filter. Me, being concerned, decide to filter it again.

I put the filtered solution into the freezer for about 15min, the solution was about 120ml (much less) so I figured a healthy time in the freezer would crystallize the remaining APAP if there was any. Took it out, it was quite cold, but no crystallization. Either good sign or bad. I filter it again and have drank the final solution. I estimate I have consumed 160-180mg out of the original 243mg of codeine. Now...I figure I got most of the APAP out which is great, but I am concerned about how much gets dissolved and if that dissolved APAP remains there if I didn't leave it sitting in the freezer long enough...

TL;DR - I used too much water in my CWE and wondering how that may affect the amount of harmful APAP is in it! Thanks!

My fears are relieved, my heart is glowing. I am satisfied and the world takes on a different hue. I know, I absolutely feel, everything is going to be alright. Money is perfectly synonymous with heroin to me, and heroin to life. To living, to happiness, to being who I truly am. Now I just need to get to the dope spot. I don’t know where it is or how to get there, but I’ll find it. I continue on my path with sublime elation.

I am excited and profoundly happy for a moment. I'm wrapped in the warm comfort of knowing I have money for heroin. That there will be no pain today.

And then my heart breaks. 

I don’t have a wad of money. I don’t have any money. I’m waking up. Why can’t I stay in this dream? God I hate this world. My bodily temperature is wrong. My skin is slithering, and my mind is racing with anxiety and fear. I feel disgusting - a feeling I know all too well. Last night I prayed that I wouldn't wake up today, as I pray every night.

I wish I was dead. 

What am I going to do today? How am I going to do it? Even in the best case scenario, it’s going to be many hours of hell before any relief is possible. I will need whatever energy I can get for this journey. I go for my bag with all my heroin garbage in it. I take out my cooker, my cotton from last night, and two older cottons that I’m not sure if I already cooked up. I know this is barely going to do anything, but it might help a little. God I hope it does. 

I put the cottons in the cooker, add water, heat it, and smush the cottons around. I take them out and squeeze the remaining water back into the cooker. I cook the solution again, because I believe that will help kill the bacteria and prevent cotton fever. But I am not absolutely sure about that. I notice the solution is clear, as I knew it would be, but I am sad and disappointed nonetheless. I suck the solution up, and squirt a little into my mouth to ascertain its potency. I can tell by taste if it will be any good. It tastes like cotton water, with none of the heroin bitterness I was praying for. I despair, and the future pain of the day flashes before my eyes. I know it is worthless, but I shot it anyway. I actually have two working veins, the main one in my hand, and a backup one in my foot for lesser shots, which I know have no chance of giving a rush. Had I only one vein, I would just bubble the shot into my thigh, but I use the foot vein this time anyways. My body responds to the needle and the fluid entering it, and gives me a second of relief. I feel my sickness recede for a moment, but my body realizes there is nothing in that fluid that it wants, and returns to its original, partially sick state.

I have $3.50 in change. I know there is nothing to sell in this house. My parents removed all of their valuables a long time ago. They are letting me stay here for the moment, thinking I have a chance again. But I am constantly going back and forth between staying at their house and living on the street, when they catch me using and kick me out. Then eventually they see me again, and I’m scraped up from a fight, or dirty and looking like I’m about to die, and they take me back in. The cycle never ends.

I think back to the days when I had a condo downtown, money to buy anything I wanted, a high powered job, and the right to be prideful over other people. A tiny part of me cares, but the rest of me is happy to be on heroin instead. I was an asshole back then anyways, and for some reason I hated life even more than I do now.

A plan formulates. I put on good clothes, as the plan will require me to look “normal” for it to succeed. I head to the train station. I hate this part the most. The train comes, and I board. Already the sickness is starting to intensify. I sit there in extreme anxiety for the upcoming scene, which has always ended well so far, but one day could end horribly. I pray the conductor hasn’t seen me before. He comes, and thank god he is someone different. He asks for my ticket. I tell him the machine ate my $20. He gives me shit, but lets me ride. I am so relieved.

The sickness gets worse. My legs are constantly jittering. I am so uncomfortable, and the aches start coming on. I am hot and cold. My mouth and nose are running, and every couple seconds I have to lean to the side of the seat and spit down the crack. I am squirming in my seat because my whole body hurts and I can’t settle into one spot.

Forty minutes later we arrive in downtown Chicago. I am so weak. I am hunched over and it takes every ounce of my strength to move around. This is going to be torture. I exert all of my effort and move to the entrance of the train station, and to look like a normal human being. I hold a couple dollars in my hand, to show I have some money. This is where the nice clothes come in.

“Excuse me sir, I lost my wallet and need to get home. Do you have anything you could spare?”

I am so embarrassed, but it is better than panhandling. I can only do that if I’m high – you have no emotions, no shame when you are high. It almost never happens though; if I’m high I won’t bother to panhandle for more money because I’m set for the moment, my mind doesn’t make connections to the future anymore.

The man gives me a dollar, and I move to a different location in the station. After a half hour I make my $10. A little bit of relief washes over me, the hard part is over. I go to the bank, and convert the change into a $10 bill.

I make my way to the “L,” the elevated train. This part isn’t difficult at least. I wait at the bottom of the stairs for the train to come. I know the timing by heart, and right before the doors close I run up, jump the turnstile, and slip into the train. Nobody cares anyways. 

By now I’m really sick. My legs are constantly moving, my eyes, nose and mouth are watering, and I’m gagging. I am writhing around in the seat, with horrible aches and pains. I start gagging, and I throw up into the crack of the seat along the wall. I don’t care who sees me, and nobody looks at me. 

The train gets closer and closer to the ghetto. All the white people get off. The black people who are still on know who and what I am. Finally I get to the stop. I walk up the street. I am not scared, I’ve done this a million times. Nothing could stop me from this anyways, I have no fear, because nothing is as important as what I need to do. A cop drives down the street. I am the only white person around, but I don’t care. He doesn’t care either. He knows I’m just another junkie, and there is no point in arresting me because it won’t accomplish anything. 

I recognize the faces of the homeless and ghetto people I see around. Someone asks me for a cigarette. Normally I will share one, but I don’t have enough today. Sorry. I am still walking up the street. Oh good, the guys with the good dope are out. I don’t need to walk further up to the crappy spot. I know the eye contact routine perfectly. We both look at each other out of the corner of our eyes. There is a specific way you have to look at them for them to deal to you, that makes you look legit. I cross the street. I walk up to him.

“Blows.”

“How many?”

“One.”

We do the casual slip, my bill goes in his hand as the little foil roll goes in mine. Sometimes they are little rolled up foils, sometimes bags. My mind has foils linked to better dope from years of random experience, so that makes me a little happier. 

I’m beaming. I’m so relieved. But the sickness increases. My body is so excited. I am walking fast down the street, constantly gagging and throwing up and spitting. I have a spot along the highway, in the underbrush, where there are bushes and small trees hide me. I call it my “nest.” I look around to see if anyone is looking, and hop the fence. I have a little area set up between the bushes. A sign I put there to sit on, that covers the dirt. I look at all the heroin garbage, and think of the times when I was there before. 

I empty the bag into the cooker, add water, and heat. Fucking wind keeps blowing out the lighter. This is going so slow, I can hardly stand it. So fucking slow I am going out of my mind. I can’t wait to get this shit in me. I’m still gagging and throwing up and spitting, trying to avoid spilling the dope as I retch. I drop the cotton in. I draw it in the needle and note the color. Thank god it has some brownish color. This could be good. Unfortunately I only have the crappy needles from the needle exchange. They are large gauge and I don’t have any large gauge veins anymore. Being able to buy a bag of 31 gauge from the pharmacy is a major luxury. So close to this happening, so close.

I slide the needle in my vein. It is on my hand, in my finger. It is a tiny blue line, as wide as the needle. I am an expert at shooting up after all this time, I’ve never met anyone who could shoot veins as small as I can. I take pride in the fact for a moment. 

I get a draw. The blood swirls into the needle, and makes a spiral that I find incredibly beautiful. Yes! This is it! I have to push the plunger in very slowly, since the vein is so small and I don’t want to blow it. 

It’s in. The wait for the rush is heaven in itself. I’m happy for the sickness, for the pain I’m in. I’m so happy that I went through hell today, grateful for the torture, because it will make this so much better. For a moment I’m still sick, but it doesn’t matter because that moment is filled with peace and solace, in anticipation of the coming sensation. 

The rush hits. “Euphoria” is but a sliver of the entirety of the experience. A black and white description for a rainbow of vibrant colors. A divine sensation of peace and happiness and pleasure and joy and comfort and appreciation and love and dreams washes over me. The most profound change occurs instantly. I feel clean. Clean. Clean in mind and body. In a split second, the physical and mental anguish I was in has completely disappeared. My body and mind are normal and healthy. I am so clean. 

My life, truly, exists in two timelines. One is the disgusting, horror filled, agonizing, indescribably horrible living hell between shots. The other is the heaven of the rush. As the rush hits, the consciousness of myself which lives only in the rush timeline awakens. It remembers the points in time of every rush it ever had as a continuing stream of consciousness. The interim periods are like a hazy dream. This is me. The real me. 

A tiny voice echoes in the back of my head. It reminds me of the pain that will occur later tonight. The hell I will soon be experiencing again. I have no plan, no way to get money tonight. I could go beg or scam again, but I won’t. I don’t know why, I just won’t. I will spend the night in withdrawals, unable to sleep. Writhing and moaning and wishing I were dead. Watching the clock tick minutes, which feel like hours. I have no idea how I will get money the next day either, I will have to steal or beg or borrow or scam. Maybe one of my dope buddies will help me. No. They never do. I’m always scared that someday I won’t be able to get money for two days straight, and then I’ll be too sick to be able to move to scrounge something up, and I will be stuck in cold turkey. Well, not that scared. I can make something happen. I always do.

I shut myself up. Shut up. Who cares about this shit. I am sitting here in my real consciousness. I’m alive for real, the rest is just a bad dream. I’m going to enjoy this time. This time of life. I am an expert in living in the moment.

My life is nothing but moments.",1531864966.0
8zpj0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8zpj0w/a_story_about_your_average_day_at_rock_bottom/,3,https://redd.it/8zpj0w,jarr1k,A story about your average day at rock bottom,"This is a story from a friend of mine I thought I'd share:


I'm so tired.

Sooo tired.

I am sick and in pain all the time, and I can no longer go through life like this. I don't have money for heroin anymore. Pain, horrible physical and mental pain all the time. That's what bi-polar is; that is, at least my bi-polar. The inability to feel pleasure, and the amplification of pain, melancholy, and basically every negative emotion know to man. Over 10 years of doctors, and not an iota of help. The fact of the matter is that there is no solution. I am nothing but a burden on everyone. I do nothing but hurt those I love. There is no legal cure for me, and I cannot afford to fix myself.

Even though my tolerance is miniscule, maybe 1-1.5 bags a day, I have been an IV addict for so long that the withdrawals are excruciating. As I mentioned, I am bi-polar, and I finally get just the right insane episode I had been waiting for. Finally, it is time. I pop bunch a of benzos, to take my fear away. Benzos have always made me feel suicidal, reckless, and fearless, so this will help take the final step for certain.

I steal a ...lethal object. Insurance policy.

A number of public transportation switches later, I finally make it to the hood, and call my guy. I am very sick at this point, and so eager for the relief of death. My dealer has been 100% reliable and sold me excellent quality dope for over 6 months now. I buy 12 bags. I notice he is gray and strange looking, but I dismiss that. 

I walk a couple blocks to my ""nest"" - the bushes alongside the I-90 highway where I can hide and do my dope. It is littered with scores of needles, and I survey the scene and smile, thinking of each moment of pleasure, or rather, each moment free of pain, that each of those needles represent. It is a peaceful area. It seems like a nice place to die, and with little chance of anyone finding me and resuscitating me.

I already took a large number of benzos, and I take some more. I make two shots, out of the 12 bags, one 8 bag shot, and one 4 bag shot. I assume the benzos, combined with my ~1 bag a day tolerance means that death and final peace will be certain.

I always thought, those people who write suicideletters don't really want to die. Or who make a big fuss and long standing threats about it. They do those things because they want something, perhaps something they can't have, or perhaps something they can, such as revenge. But a tired soul wants nothing but peace. When animals sense their mortality, they go under the porch, or find some other comfortable spot, and stay there until it is over. Same with humans who really want to die. 

No note, no phone calls, no threats, and no warnings - just a lone young man sitting on the ground, ecstatic for the final release of pain.

First the 8 bag shot into the arm, followed quickly by the 4 bag shot IMed into the thigh. 

I am so happy. Happier than I've ever been in my life (without heroin that is). I'm so eager, I'm so excited. This is a dream come true. 

I sit there.

I wait.

I wait.

I wait.

Nothing. 

Try to imagine that. To be certain of death. To anticipate a sensation that will take the pain away and end the nightmare of life. To wait. To wait. Where is it? WHERE IS IT?

As it turns out, my gray, 6 month-reliable dealer turned into a junkie himself, and ripped me off. 

I go insane. More insane than I've been in my entire life. I am going to kill a man.

I grab my ... lethal object.

I walk back to where he usually is, looking for him, and certain to end his existence and my own, for stealing my dream of a peaceful death from me. 

I ask around. Where the fuck is he. He's dead.

I meet someone ... long story short we are able to get some money.

The rest of the story would be too self incriminating, but I spent 2 weeks in a crack house is basically the end.",1531864636.0

Coming off an opiate and trying a new one from the pain clinic. Also Benzos are involved with the process.,"I have been on Hydrocodone for about 3 years now. I take two 7.25s a day. One when I wake up and one when I go to bed. I went to a new pain clinic the past week because mine closed down. I am only 25 years old and the doctor there does not want me to stay on Hydrocodone because of my young age. She said to me what will I do when I am 55 if I keep taking the hydrocodone. 

So the doctor wants me to taper myself off hydrocodone and completely be off of it before I start the new Opiate. The new opiate is a patch called Butrans and you put it on once a week and wear it. My concern comes in here, I am also on Clonazepam and I have been on it for 7 years. I only take a half of a 0.5 every morning and every night. My concerns are is the Butrans patch going to be life threatening to take with the Clonazepam? The nurse practitioner and the Doctor there both approved it but I am also highly sensitive to medications. I still get really big buzzes off of the 7.25 hydrocodone I have been taking for 3 years.  


Also I am mainly wondering how hard will it be for me to taper off the Hydrocodone? I am not experienced in opiates whatsoever so any advice and input would be so greatly appreciated. Also I have no clue why she took this route to take me off what I am on now and put me on another opiate. I have no clue of her reasons and things like that so please don't tell me I am stupid and stuff over it. General help would really be appreciated. Thank you all so much for you time. ",1531861946.0

We were dopesick. Our two connects were not picking up. I was furiously sucking down my cigarette as I paced back and forth. ""Come on, there HAS to be someone"" I said as we both scrolled through our phones. 

""Yes! Finally I got a fucking reply."" Christian said. ""If we pick up Kay and Story at her house, we can go down to his guy and we can all get a dub."" 

Kay was gorgeous.. I had known of her in high school. She was two grades ahead of me. I remember she was extremely popular back on MySpace and people always used her pictures for fake profiles. She had dirty blonde hair, porcelain skin and tattoos. The complete opposite of me. 

Story was a drug buddy of hers. He always sounded fucked up and talked in a raspy monotone voice. Kay and Story climbed in the backseat of the car. I couldn't keep my eyes off of Kay. ""You look so familiar.."" I turned to her. 

""Woah, so do you!"" she replied, her eyes widening. 

""Didn't you use to hang out at the skatepark with Ron, Kyle, and Izzy?"" I asked. 

""Yes!"" she said. ""I knew I've seen you somewhere before."" 

We were on our way to a specific area in a large
southeast city, infamous for its availability of drugs - heroin in particular. 

Kay and I kicked it off immediately. It was nothing I've ever felt before.. like we had known each other our whole lives. We were kindred spirits. You could say it was love at first sight. 

""Almost there."" Kay told us. I was looking out my window. It looked as if a hurricare had come though. Every house appeared to abandoned, boarded up, or destroyed. ""I'll be right back"" Story mumbled. He got out of the car and headed to a sketchy apartment building that seemed to be vacant. I bummed a cigarette off Kay. It was a Newport Menthol 100. After what seemed like an eternity, Story returned. ""Let's get the fuck out of here."" 


♡ ♡ ♡ 


Kay had added me on Facebook. She didn't have a phone, so that was our main basis of communication. We talked almost everyday. Kay and I had hinted feelings to each other for a while. When we weren't together, we were usually scheming a way to get dope and hang out. 

One night I was nodding with my phone in my hand. ""I wish you were here. You're the only girl I like."" I sent her. ""I am so flattered by that! You're seriously the only girl I ever want to hang out with."" she responded. 

I got butterflies in my stomach every time I saw her. Little did I know she'd be giving me literal butterflies in a few years.. 


♡ ♡ ♡ 


*Late 2013* 

""I'm done."" I muttered, in between vomiting bright yellow bile. ""I can't keep fucking doing this."" I told Christian. I was fed up with the cycle. Getting fucked up, running out, getting sick, having to drive to the city just to restart it all over again. So I kicked. 

I quit heroin and I cut off everyone in the process. I couldn't talk or hang out with my current friend group, because they were all still using. I couldn't risk the temptation. I deleted all contacts and social media, including my Facebook. 


♡ ♡ ♡ 


*Mid 2018* 

Kay crossed my mind many times. I often wondered how she was doing. I eventually got back into opiates again, this time prescription pills. I wondered if I should try to get back in contact with her. I knew she had been in recovery and was sober as of 2014. But I resisted the urge to reach out. She seemed to be happy without me. What would she want to do with me? I'd only ruin her chance of living a clean life. 

The days turned into years. I was always with other people, but I found myself thinking about her. I medicated myself in a perpetuated daze to suppress my true feelings. 

One afternoon, I felt what I could only describe as an ominous feeling in my gut.. even though it was a beautiful day in May. 

Christian walked into the room I was sitting in. He stared at me with a stunned look upon his face ""What?!"" I asked. He took a pause. 

""Kay is dead."" 

My heart dropped into my stomach. There was a lump in my throat. Tears welled up in my eyes. I couldn't speak. I ran to my bathroom and turned on the shower. I sat down in the bathtub and wept where no one could see me. 

I would never have the opportunity to tell her how I really feel. She was gone. And I didn't even get to say goodbye. 

Kay died from sepsis on May 26. ",1531859717.0

However, I somehow misplaced it. Not sure if I deliberately placed it in a place I normally don't or if it's lost as opposed to misplaced. 

&nbsp;

Two days ago I went to take count of what I currently had. After dosing 2mg, I had just three days worth left if I stayed on that dose. After looking around on the floor and surrounding areas I did manage to find two more 2mg pieces so I added those to the daily pill case.


So now I had five days worth at 2mg. It appeared a rapid taper would likely be in order. 


&nbsp; 

Options, options, options... hrmm well Tim did hit me up late in the weekend asking if I had subs, I told him I'd check but that even in the best case I apportion my dosages days in advanced. Any deviation any loan that isn't paid back in time really fucks my shit up. Hence my reluctance to loan out a couple of subs. Two subs for this friend would literally last two days. Maybe one. He is very unlikely to cut them in half. 

Those same two subs would last me eight whole days with n doubts as long as I don't misplace them, which I actually did misplace. I couldn't guarantee being able to help Tim but I surely would look and that's roughly when I discovered that I had no fucking idea where I put the three subs I just bought days earlier.

&nbsp;

The silver lining; my sub connect says they're available later or tomorrow. I thought she ran out of subs because she only sold me three instead of four when I last saw her but she also seems to restock on unpredictable intervals. She says she gets a script but I think at least half the time she's buying them elsewhere and flipping them. I don't really care if she pays five bux and charges me ten. As long as I'm getting the going rate and not getting beat over the head I'm a happy camper.

&nbsp;

I really hope I find those misplaced subs so that I don't have to go trekking across town to get two more. So far I feel fine with just 1mg in me, but most people who quit subs don't feel symptoms until day three. So it's conceivable that I won't feel any strong negative effects of lowing my dose until day three. From what I've read, if you cut your dose of subs you'll still get relief from WD symptoms when you take your dose but instead of feeling 100% for 12 hours you might feel 100% for 8 hours.

Knowing that I can see my sub connect by tomorrow makes me want to take the other half of the 2mg piece that I cut in half today. Still, if I don't need it might as well see how many hours I can go through on that 1mg. Surely it can't be so easy to jump down 50%.. I'm assuming there's a delay in feeling the drop because of the fact that I've got multiple days of half-life built up.

&nbsp;

I wonder though, if someone is on 2mg of subs and they just drop to 1mg.. like I said I'm assuming the person might not feel it on the first day and when they start feeling symptoms, they won't feel them for at least a few hours after dosing. 

**If someone was to drop from 2mg to  1mg... how long til they feel it? Can that person just keep taking 1mg until their body adjusts to that lower dose?**

I'm very curious to hear from anyone who has experience with any similar usage scenario. ",1531857717.0

8zoe0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8zoe0h/sex_pill_samuraix/,7,https://redd.it/8zoe0h,sloan_fitch,Sex Pill: Samurai-X,"#This is a review of Samurai-X, the sexual performance enhancing supplement.

It's so beautiful outside. The wind was ferociously shaking the vegitation up until a few minutes ago. Still got some trees swaying and the passing rumble of light thunder. The sky has that magnificent dark blue - greyish monotones.


I'm glad it's like this outside, the rain is inconsistent but I don't see any signs that the sky will clear up just yeat. Perfect excuse for me not to get off my ass and ride my bike. This is not to say the weather stops me if I want to get going. If I had work right now and there was a torrential downpour, I'd suit-up and get on my awesomely outfitted bike. 

&nbsp;

I kinda tried out a dick pill the other day, Samurai-X. Not to be mistaken with the Japanese anime OVA that chronicles how Kenshin got his name among many other things including his cross-shaped scar.

So anyway, what makes these pills unique is they have all the usual ingredients - it's more like a supplement capsule. Anyway, contains nitric oxide/l-arginine, horny goat weed and other stuff I can't remember. The product I bought was Samurai-X ""special edition"", I think 8250 and the packaging says it'll work for five days.

&nbsp;

One more thing about Samurai-X. The FDA posted a warning about it, they said that there's one ingredient that's in the product that isn't listed on the box. Sildenafil - the active ingredient in Viagra. Well shit, sounds good to me. The only reason I'd say it's trouble is for the same reason the FDA says it's trouble, because it's not written on the box. Secondly, you really don't want to drink alcohol on Viagra or it's generic conterparts. So not knowing a product has the stuff in it could be treacherous considering alcohol often accompanies opportunities for sex. Thankfully it's not a pre-requisite, unless you're really ugly or your partner is. 

&nbsp;


I'm not gonna get into the ""why"" at this instant but I will report my findings. Yeah, the morning wood was more rigid at unexpected intervals for the three days after I took the suppliment. The bottle said it would take at least 3-4 hours for it to begin taking effect and I'd say that's true. This stuff might be a good over the counter alternative to Viagra if your local sex shops and delis sell it ""under the counter"". 


Good if you're in a bind or have a girl in a bind but can't get wind behind your sails. Just be sure to hydrate well and maybe don't get the 5-day variant unless you want to experience what I just did. I don't know if it's true or how it's possible to have the Sildenafil last multiple days from one capsule, this calls a lot of shit into question. Questions that are not answered thoroughly by the label or search engine queries. 


&nbsp;


The adverse effects didn't occur until night 2 or 3. During the day at work I was smoking the shit out of my vaporizer pen. Hell, I been vaping the various hash oils since I got it on Saturday. I thought my headache at work yesterday was directly related to the hash oil extracts. 

You see, the first cartridge of hash oil was pretty decent stuff. It tasted like weed but was labeled ""Tangy Mango"" or something like that. The second and third cartridges I purchased, I got from a someone else. They seemed good, the packaging looked okay and all. The main difference between the first one and these two is that these two has a lower viscosity liquid within. 


The bubbles in thick hash oil barely move wheras this thinner stuff was more like liquid or a thin syrup.

&nbps;

A coworker told me that the person who sells the two more recent hash oils I bought gets stuff that's not super great. That as you get to the bottom of the cartridge the stuff turns brown - not necessarily bad but he claims this doesn't happen on the better cartridges he's been buying.


The first day I had that hash oil at work I had to smoke it at work - such fun. I scaled back my consumption after the first day, but yesterday I was using one of the newer ""lower quality"" cartridges. I noticed that no matter how long I hit it, that I didn't get the compulsion to cough my lungs out as I did with the higher quality hash oil.


Are there any useless fillers in this hash oil? Is it just less potent? Maybe a combination of the two - hence why I initially assumed that my increasingly pounding headache was related to this.

&nbsp;

As the pounding headache got worse, I ate a meal then sat down to watch som SciFi. After over an hour it didn't get better. When I finally went to bed I had a pounding headache -- the pounding of whihc matched my pulse. From 2-6am I barely slept if at all. From 6-9am I may have slept a tiny bit but I remember being awake. Unable to get comfortable, if I didn't know any better I'd wonder if I was experiencing a withdrawal symptom.


Sore muscles everywhere, but for some reason if I slept on my side, a position that has proven it's worth on days when I couldn't sleep - my arm would fucking hurt. Like a string of muscle would just cry out ""I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.. just reminding you that you do have an arm and this arm is going to keep signaling."" Lay down flat, put that arm in a particular position and the sensation is masked but the cold air is not. 

&nbsp;


I don't know what it was but the tossing, turning, hot, cold and sore muscles were accompanied by more erections that I'm accustomed to when I'm feeling sickly. So then I made the connection and said to myself, ""maybe it was that Samurai-X suppliment and not my weed vape."" Maybe there was an interraction between the two but who knows.
Sex pill (supplement) review 
&nbsp;

Bottom line, although Samurai-X does not state that it has Sildenafil in it's ingredients it may still prove useful to some who don't have the time of ability to get a Viagra script. Prescribed or not the active ingredient does not mesh well with alcohol at all, in fact doing so would give one the same symptoms I encountered plus some stomach sensations that I was fortunate enough not to experience. Kinda hard to have sex when you're feeling dizzy and have pounding headache.



One more thing, taking something that has Sildenafil in it while also having a heart condition can be super hazardous. A doctor knowing this would probably avoid prescribing it to someone who carried a high risk factor. Considering you can get Samurai-X at many bodegas, I think this post could be of benefit to some of you since I couldn't find a solid detailed review on the product elsewhere.

&nbsp; 

Days one and two it did not interfere with my sexual function but if I were to get laid yesterday the headache most certainly would have. I'm really glad I did not have any further sexual rendezvous after the weekend ended.

Oh and finally, I did manage to get rid of the pounding headache when I finally copped three hours of sleep after 9am. Not 100% but enough that I could get up, drink my coffee, hydrate with some water and pull it together. I feel much better now, still some lingering effect but nowhere near as bad as last night. I am currently refraining from smoking my vape pen and if I do it'll be used sparingly today. On future days when I have no weird supplements in my system, perhaps then I can binge vape to determine if that was the cause of my headache but I'm already pretty confident it was the sex pill.

8zo5v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8zo5v5/chemical_peace/,3,https://redd.it/8zo5v5,FilmCroissant,Chemical Peace,"Fuck, yet another day of hanging on by a thread. I wake up begrudgingly, unwilling to move or exist, yet shocked into motion by the first portents of sickness. My skin feels icky as though it were trying to peel off but is forced to remain stuck to my body. The first stomach cramps are manifesting and in order to prevent any worse symptoms, I collect all the cash I can find in my junked-out abode. Yawning and teary-eyed, I pick up the wallet off the nightstand which is littered with syringes, cookers, lighters, and red and brown drops; a shrine to the urban alchemy that is cooking #3 heroin.


I stumble out the door, forgoing basic hygiene and wearing a shirt that needed ironing yesterday. Day five of my binge. It is summer and the sky is clear and blue, as though the ocean had been inverted and suspended above the earth in a great dome. My dealer is still asleep as it is 8 AM and he is himself binging on crystal and benzos. My only chance to score H is The Park, a square of disheveled greenery and  wooden benches sprinkled with bird shit, as well as the obligatory rickety playground. It seems the denizens of this center of my city’s drug mythology never sleep, which means they're perfect for early morning emergencies. On the downside, they're exactly the types you’d expect to stay in parks all day, forcing down canned swill and selling stuff.

&nbsp;

I get off at the adjacent bus station and enter the park, the trees closing above to cause a pleasant shade and agreeably chilly air. The roads are covered with tiny pebble stones which make crunching sounds as I walk towards the spot through the alley. The actual drug spot is near a park bench and a kiosk, a low wall affords an opportunity to sit. Cliques of derelicts are shored up on the road, sidling towards hopeful customers and cooing promises of chemical dreams; shifty-eyed and sallow-skinned, peddlers and patrons alike. I approach my usual guy, a white guy with dreads and decent enough product.


With three bubbles, roughly 200mg each, in my pocket, I enter the nearby toilet. My works are in my backpack and I put the cooker on the shiny metal sink. Now comes the ritual, a process I enjoy at least as much as actually shooting up. I concoct a nasty sludge, dark brown with floating specks of cut, in awe of the mental gymnastics that enable me to inject this foul soup in my veins. With growing despair, I poke around for a vein. After a while, I register - dark blood shoots forth into the syringe, much in the form of a mushroom cloud rising from the smoldering ruins of your bombarded dreams and ambitions.

&nbsp;

I open the door, transformed. Normal people cannot appreciate how magical a place a public restroom can be. In my desperate sickness I didn't appreciate the quaintness and harmony of the park. The gentle trees joining limbs to shield the sun; the birds twittering in synchronicity with the plodding chatter of the people; a scene that lends credence to the Buddhist teaching that all is one. And in the middle of it all - a soul in search, though arrived at a treacherous chemical peace.

This weekend I purchased 0.4 of some fire tar from a good buddy of mine and 2 hours later when I was about to prep some for nasal administration it was nowhere to be found. It was his last shit from that fire batch too and what sucks is that this was 3 hours away from where I live at currently. I had asked him to save that amount for me the day before so I could pick up right before driving back home. After I made my purchase I stuffed it in my pants pocket, (the little pocket sometimes used for coins). I’ve always stored my stuff there and it is mostly always a reliable storage place. Then I went to my parents house to say bye and  ran some errands, put gas on car etc. As I was getting ready for the 3 hour drive back home I realized the stuff dreams are made of was no longer in my pocket. I spent another 3 hours looking for this shit, went back to gas station looked on the ground, went back to my parents looked all over, asked my buddy if I’d drop it outside his house, looked through my dirty ass car for what seemed like eternity and nope, nada, zip. It was such a disappointing feeling. I drove the 3 hours back home nonstop thinking where the fuck could I have dropped it. This was Sunday and I’ve spent a big chunck of yesterday and today looking through my car, and clothes. So much so that my car is now sparkling clean. I secretly hope someone found my shit and it didn’t just melt to waste out on the ground.

She had beautiful, dark brown skin. She had a hard and pretty face, predatory cheekbones that intimidated and attracted me in a way I wasn’t used to. You know what I mean? Like sometimes the weirdest things about a woman can be so attractive.  For me it was that Gabriella looked so primitive and mean. I loved her cheekbones and those black eyes looking through me, but when we got back on the dope, everything softened. She was still pretty, don’t get me wrong. It just wasn’t the same as before. 

She had been smoking it before I found out and finally gave in that morning she threw my typewriter out of the window. Now, she was back on the needle and had nothing to hide, because I was using too. It was the fabled and elusive China White that people did in this part of the country. From what I could tell though is that just like the inconsistent quality of black heroin on the west coast, so is white powder on the east side of the Mississippi. That first morning we got six bags for the hundred dollars I slapped on the table.  I did one and flopped out. My lips turned blue. It had been several months since I’d done any drugs, much less a potent shot of heroin. And that’s kind of how that goes. 

When I woke up, Gabriella had done the other five bags.  She told me she thought I was dead, which made me wonder why she never called the paramedics. Calling 911 and dealing with that would have messed with her high and interfered with her shooting up the other five bags I bought.  That was obvious. To be honest, I wasn’t even irritated about her thinking I was dead that whole time while she kept getting high and letting lit cigarettes fall out of her mouth. It looked like a whole pack had been lit one by one and set on the carpet by her feet. I wasn’t mad that she had almost burned the house down, but I did want to do another bag. I was mad that they were all gone. I was mad she hadn’t saved at least one more for me, and right then, I realized I was right during those first 42 hours when I kept thinking to myself that such a beautiful woman falling in love with me so quickly was too good to be true. It was, and this was the proof. 

Somehow, her doing the rest of the heroin and letting my cold corpse rot on the floor for all she knew and the mess of emotions and lies she’d brought into my life, somehow, she made it my fault. I let her. I mean how could I say that my being involved to this degree with someone so crazy wasn’t a reflection of my own insanity and unhealthiness. It was. It didn’t mean I was happy about it, and since I was resigned to the fact that I was crazy too, I stayed with her.",1531842040.0

I came out of treatment about 2 weeks ago after completing my 3 month program and I’m not the same person. I over think things now, I don’t confidently approach situations like I always used to, I feel like anxious now and with a low self esteem, it sucks, I know after an 11 year heroin addiction this can be expected, but it’s actually having a negative impact on my quality of life. 

One of the biggest reasons, as shallow as it sounds but I must be honest, is due to the fact that I’ve gained so much weight. I’ve always been in good shape. I swam competitively in High school and after that I just had a good frame, I really used to like the way I looked, I was very confident in that aspect of myself. I’ve started to gym now and I know that eventually I’ll feel better about this, but it’s just crazy how being heavier has effected me.. 

There’s so much I’m gonna have to get used to, but it’s just fucked up having a more positive body image when you think of yourself as an active addict than as a recovering one. Now it’s just one of the many things I miss about drugs. ",1531835642.0

I went from poppy pods to pharms (mainly oxy, but really anything I could get my hands on) to heroin. Then I realized about 3 years ago that it was becoming impossible to maintain a normal life (job, wife, etc) and constantly use. So I tried cutting my heroin use down to chipping (on 3 weeks, off 3 weeks), but that also didn't work because I was good for 3 weeks then in withdrawal for a week, and it interfered with daily life. So I eventually quit all together, and soon thereafter entered a state of depression. Using made life miserable, but not using also made it miserable. I started using hydrocodone maybe twice per month just to quell the boredom, but even 50mg created zero euphoria and really just made me feel weird.

Enter DHC. I was recently offered 60 pills of 60mg dihydrocodeine, which is quite rare in the US. I decided fuck it - it's known as a weak opiate and whats the worst that could happen? I read up on it and a lot of people said that it's so weak, they took 400mg and it barely did anything. I was not expecting much. So when I got it, I immediately took 3 (180mg) and was very surprised that I was high as fuck. It was WAY more euphoric than hydrocondone, and I nodded right the fuck out. For me, it sits somewhere between hydrocodone an oxycodone on the euphoria scale. I then discovered that I could take only 60mg of this stuff in the morning and another 60mg later and I would have a nice euphoric glow all day with good energy. Fucking awesome. Strange, because others seem to not have the same reaction, but awesome none the less. So I went on like this for a month, knowing that I was probably going to feel like shit when I ran out. Well, that day came and I was amazed again - I barely have any withdrawal whatsoever. A tiny bit of extra body pain that is easily managed with tylenol, and that's about it. If I were to use anything else daily for a month, I would be feeling like crap for at least 3 days.

I must have some strange brain chemistry. Maybe this stuff hits a different opioid receptor besides the Mu (perhaps delta?), but it's pretty much the ideal opiate for me. It's got low enough affinity that tolerance seems to build very slowly, it's inexpensive, it feels good and it seems like it doesn't have much withdrawal.

BTW, for anyone who might be inclined to think that these are pressed, they aren't. I received them from overseas, and they were sealed in blister packs in the original box from the manufacturer. They're the real deal.",1531833984.0

The only thing is, he doesn’t upcharge me. I pay what he pays. He’s always been really cool and always real with me. If something’s up he’d tell me. We’ve known each other for a few months.
Well last night he picks me up around 11. We park in a parking lot and finally get ahold of his dboy at around 12. By this point I’m sick as fuck. I hadn’t had a shot all day. I am broke as fuck and only had $40 to throw down anyways. 
We start heading to his dboy who is about 30 minutes away. We are two streets from the dboy when my guy says “Sorry dude, you’re gonna have to get out while I go get it two streets down. He doesn’t want me bringing anyone to his mom’s place. It’ll take two minutes” 
I agree and get out, chilling on the side of the road for a minute. Now my phone can’t make calls or texts, but it can receive texts. He knows that. He texts me about 20 minutes later saying “I have to take Dboy to Walgreens really quick. It’ll take 10 minutes and it will be worth it.” 
I can’t respond so I just sit and wait, time inching because of how sick I am. At this point we are extremely far from my apartment walking-wise and this crosses my mind. 
Long story short, I wait 45 minutes before deciding he isn’t coming back. I was stunned, pissed, sick, and confused. I start walking the hours-long walk home. I’d be lucky if I get there by sunrise. 
After about 20 minutes of walking, I get that magical call from dude. I answer almost in tears of happiness. “Bro what the fuck happened?” “Dude I’m so sorry, he had to go to Walmart because the Walgreens was closed and it took longer. I don’t see you wya?” “I started walking home. I thought you weren’t coming back!” “Bro you know I’d never do that to you. Wya I got the stuff and can come get you.”

Right on the other side of the tress where I came out there was a fence that was behind a dumpster, so I sat behind the fence for what felt like 5 minutes but could have been more or less, I really don’t know. Once I decide to get up I step from behind the fence and walk into the parking lot to see where I am and of course all of the sudden two fucking cops pull into the parking lot and I’m standing there, a 16 year old fucked up kid with there lights bright as fuck in my eyes. They both get out and ask me the general questions, did you come from that party, did you drink, I told him I did and that I only had a couple beers. Then they pat me down and me “not having anything on me” ( you’ll find out later on) they call my mom and tell her to meet one of them at this academy sports that was near by. Luckily my mom answered bc they would’ve had to take me in the for the night probably if none of my parents would have been able to answer. But yeah back to the part in () once I got home I got undressed and while doing that I found that I had a Concerta pill in my pocket which the cop went right over while patting me down.

* **Clonazepam** (Ravotril, k-pin): Strong node for like 1-2 hours. Once I woke up with my head over the keyboard and the square pattern marked on my forehead LOL. More psychological than bodily high.
* **Diazepam** (Valium): I'm on it right know, milder nod with an amazing body high, long lasting, hard to keep your eyes straight for hours, people will definitely realize you are ""on something"". Totally recommended.
* **Midazolam** (No idea about brand name outside Chile): Very short half life benzo, and very strong. Immediate extreme nod (quasi blackout I'll say). Very euphoric if you fight to stay awake. Be specially careful with this combo. Midazolam can be shot, I call the mix ***slowball***. Almost fell to the ground with the needle in my arm.

I'll just take it out myself.","An old, orange lady who I called Garfield and a young African immigrant took care of my meds, and I kept them under my tongue until I got back to my room, where I administered them to myself through my PICC line. Whenever I took a shower I used a plastic card to try scraping the crocodile skin on the bottoms of my feet from the pair of shoes that made them smell so bad at the detox. At night I snuck out of my window and walked down to a trailer park to buy meth or heroin.

My nurses all knew I was high but couldn’t figure out how I got it, and the administrators gave me a drug test when the maid found blackened spoons in my bathroom. When they gave me the cup, I used the old urine I saved from before. One of the administrators came to see me the next day.

“So, Mr. Chapman, when those results come back from the lab, you’ll be out of here.” Her tone conveyed disgust and rejoicing at the prospect of my expulsion. I was on my second round of antibiotics after the first ones didn’t work.

“Okay. Well, aren’t you sending the urine to a lab?”

“Yes.”

“So, you’ll know what’s in my system, right? You’ll be able to know if it was heroin or morphine, right?”

“Exactly. We’ll know you were doing heroin and you’ll be gone.”

“No. I won’t.”

“Yes, you will, and then you’ll probably die of the infection. Do you have anything to say for yourself, after throwing away your life like this?”

“Yeah, I do. Get the f\*ck out of my room and leave me the f\*ck alone until you have those results! I’m trying to watch my cartoons!”

She didn’t have a response, but she left. I got caught smoking cigarettes in my room at night by one of the nursing assistants, but got away with it. Joints were harder to smoke, but I smoked them in the room too. They knew I used my PICC line to inject my painkillers, because it ballooned out where I clogged it and had to be replaced. All but one of the nurses hated my guts and wanted to get rid of me. The one who didn’t hate me spent extra time in my room watching Comedy Central and went to the store to buy me every flavor of Laffy Taffy. She talked to me about sex with her boyfriend and how he didn’t love her like she loved him. When she lingered awkwardly to talk to me other nurses would make up reasons to come into the room and check my charts or IV pump.

Back home my family expected me to die, so my father visited to boost my spirits and maybe spend some of our last time together. I didn’t know that’s what they thought, but my father had concluded from everything he heard that I would be lucky to live. He brought a carnival king cake from Louisiana to the nurses. At Buffalo Wild Wings we split a six-piece of wings and an appetizer of spinach dip, which was different. I always ate a lot of food and quickly, but the regimen of dilaudid and morphine and the hospital bed suppressed my appetite. My stomach had shrunk so that I could barely eat, and my dad attributed my lethargy and lightheadedness to anemia. He made me get my hair cut and beard shaved off. When I got back to the home, an older nurse said, “Boy! You got me all turned on, and I’m black!”

Once he got back home, he told me over the phone what tests to make the doctors run and what numbers were good or acceptable and what was bad. We paid close attention to my erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which detects inflamation and felt relieved when it went down. My father saved my life for the umpteenth time, and after three months they let me go with an envelope of 12 dilaudid and a few prescriptions to be filled back home.

I gave the nurses one last headache when I snuck out of the facility with my PICC line in. One nurse wanted to take it out, but I told her the next nurse on shift would. When the next nurse came on I told her the one before had already taken it out, and I left in a hurry. The muscles burned in my atrophied body, and I wheezed all the way to the bus stop. If there was ever an appropriate time to refrain from smoking cigarettes this was it, but I smoked at least three Camel 99s before I made it four blocks to the bus stop. In the airport bathroom, I mixed up 24 milligrams of dilaudid and pushed it down my PICC line, but my body only tingled for a second. Then I felt nothing but sober.

Between flights my dad called me.

“Seems they have a big brouhaha over at the old folks’ home you were living in.”

“Really? How do you know that?”

“Well, they called us, pretty frantic. Did you get out of there with your PICC line in?”

“Yeah. I still have it in.”

“Sh\*t! Riley!”

“It’s okay. I’ll take it out myself.”

“I don’t know about that. I think that’s dangerous. Let’s figure it out when you get here.”

“Okay. Sounds good. We’re about to take off.” I walked to the aircraft’s bathroom, and it moved in my heart and through my chest as I pulled two feet of thin tubing out of my arm. It was probably a biohazard, and I thought about that before disposing of it in the waste bin.",1531796360.0

For now ill just summarize.

I tried evading the police the other day.  They weren't after me, but were scoping me out suspiciously.  I hit the pedal hard when I was out of their sight, and pulled into the first lot and building to hide.

It was a nunnery. Damnit. Smooth. Cops creep past scanning for my car. Pull in to far side of lot.

Of course they would. I don't belong here, 99% of males don't.

I burst into a desperate impromptu acting performance to save my freedom.  It just so happens nuns outside knew and were awaiting a delivery.  What are the chances I might sell the same product they need? Cop conversation occurs. Not what they expected. Im sure they drove away confused.

Need cops to leave and not question you? Stay quiet, smile while nuns handle the words for the most. 

I take the products into lobby, pretend I'm checking order.  Enough time for cops to be far enough away. I apologize, say I grabbed the wrong order. Ill be right back after I go to my trunk.

I met my love the next day, in the pharmacy waiting room. I was in so much pain that I just tore the bottle open and took 2 of them, Vicodin. I could barely choke them down, but I managed. The car ride home was sullen and painful.

I slowly ascended the stairs to my room, on the side of the house facing the sunrise. I figured I would try to make the best of my day off school and maybe see if I could figure out a few of the more confusing console commands for Half-Life 2. I sat in my chair, cross-legged, and spun into place.

And in that moment, I was filled with a love I had never known before and have only tried to find since, in the side alleys of cities under the purest blue skies with clouds stretching for a million miles, on a thousand plateaus. I met the friend who would never leave me, if only I could keep pace; if only I could grab his hand, just inches out of reach. I chased Him, down the nights and down the days, I chased Him, down the arches of the years; I chased Him, down the labyrinthine ways of my own mind; and in the mist of tears. And it was all worth it, I knew, and do. My manna from heaven, my light in the dark, my best friend home for Christmas, my warmest blanket on their coldest days. My friend who never leaves me, just ahead.

normally I can take a half a sub and still get high right after, not 100%, but maybe 60% which is good enough for me. 

maybe it's because i've been doing way more dope than sub recently, but when me and partner in crime decided to head to the city around 7am, I did 6 nics and felt pretty much nothing. It sucked. I actually thought I kept missing, but I think the sub really was blocking it. Just so surprising because I can ALWAYS get high after subs. I thought I was some kind of special fluke or something. But like I said I've barely been taking subs at all lately, so maybe that has something to do with it.

So this evening I go back, get 12 more nics to split. Do one, nothing. Mix up two, kinda feel it but barely and it lasts only a couple minutes.

I don't know why but it makes me so depressed to spend the money and not get high. Buying dope to begin with might as well be lighting your money on fire, but when I spend the money and miss or for whatever other reason don't get high, I just feel like such a sack of shit.

I have 3 nics left. I'm trying to get drunk and forget I have them until the sub wears off more, but I might end up just telling partner in crime to take them, because I'm probably gonna try to do them and get nothing out of them and he'd appreciate them way more.



blah.

to top it off i just realized i fucked up my chances of getting PTI because you need to apply within 28 days, and I waited too long. go back to court the 25th I think. which is also my mom's birthday. fuck me. i hate feeling like such a piece of garbage.

update: of the three nics I had left, only two still had shit in them. not sure if one spilled or partner in crime stole one, but idgaf he paid for it anyway. did the two that were left, felt it a little better, but still nothing intense and it'll probably wear off within 10 minutes. still hate myself. gave him all my empties/crumbs. who cares. might as well have just wiped my ass with that money and flushed it down the toilet for all the good it did us anyway.

The doctor said that, in his experience, people basically mature out of addiction by chance.  If that is true, we should reduce harm, and prescribe heroin.  That apparently lowers users because it cripples the market, as well as saves lives of the users, and allows them to live normal lives.

How do you think your life would be different if you had access to essentially free heroin?  I wonder about the emotional cost the most personally.  If you can get an steady, free supply of heroin, how much a reduction in stress that would be.

Another question I have.  If you could get a steady, good supply like that, would you be less inclined to quit?

Last year, I discovered my uncle was a heroin addict, and ever since my world turned upside down. I still remember those days when I was a little kid and he never had money but still managed to buy me a T-shirt or give me something that really had an emotional value. 

I always knew something was wrong, the way my grandparents and my mother treated him never seemed to make sense, they would always hide money and jewelry, or lock it up in our rooms, he would come back home late and act crazy but innocent as I was, I never thought about it. 

Now it makes sense, but in some way, I really understand him like no one else does. I’ve seen him steal my money while he thought I was asleep, I’ve seen him ruin others life’s with his selfishness, I’ve seen him not giving a fuck about his 14 years old son just because of heroin. But I know that deep inside there, is the man that has been showing me true love ever since I was a little baby, and in some crazy way there is a insane bond between us that nothing could break. 

I just want to thank him for showing me how to learn from his mistakes, and never end up like him. While he was nodding right now, he told me that if I had a gun I could kill him right away and end everything right now, and I saw the crazy emptiness in his soul, fuck. 

As much as I wish there is some hope for him, I know there isn’t. He is never coming back and there isn’t anything anyone could do, especially me. I’m sorry if this was to depressing but I couldn’t keep this inside me, I just hope you guys do fine.

Jesus Christ - I was floating in outer space! If I wanted to be functional, .05 was my single shot limit. This quarter lasted me like 3 weeks - I usually bought two per week!

Well we got our results and it looks like I'm the problem in the situation and not my girlfriend, and its highly likely that its because of my major drug use since i was around 17 years old. So I've made the decision to get sober from all substances. 

I used to be a heavy alcoholic, drinking around a litre of vodka per day and hiding it from my girlfriend until she obviously found out, Started going to AA meetings and i quit for a long while but slowly came back into drinking all the time again as well as using oxy, coke, MDMA, ketamine and occasionally heroin for the last few years. I thought i had it under control but if i have oxy (or any drug really) I'm going to do it regardless of what i tell myself. If i can't get oxy ill just get a bottle and a bag of blow instead.

The usual sperm count for acitive sperm is 4&#37; and mine was a little bit under 1&#37;. So thats the main reason i can't get my girl pregnant. So i have a few 40mg oxy pills left, and once I'm done with those, I'm done. Done drinking and done snorting coke every god damn weekend and blacking out on liquor all the time. I just went 5 days without oxy and had some minor withdrawals so I'm not worried about that, more so of the mental cravings I'm sure i will have.   


Hopefully with all the money ill be saving from all the drugs i won't be buying now ill finally be able to propose to my girlfriend who stuck by me with my addictions. Honestly if she didn't stick by me i don't know where the fuck i would be today. We own a house, have a dog and want to start a family and its all because of her. She never gave up on me in my worst times, Stuck by me and looked after me like a child when i was going through major alcohol withdrawals. She even took off fucking work for a week so she could be there for me because she was scared i was going to have seizures.  I owe my life to this girl and its time for me to grow the fuck up and give back to her what she has always wanted. A child.   


I have a long, long road ahead of me, but i am determined this time to get sober. Wish me luck. :)",1531770229.0

I used to be a heavy oxy/hydro user, but got clean a few months ago. I've been using morphine this time around, mostly just because I can get it super cheap and frequently. My question is: how do you guys deal with nausea on morphine? I'm assuming I'm not alone in this problem, a few pals of mine confirmed they experience it as well. I had some ondansteron which helped a little but I don't have anymore. I really enjoy the sedating effects, it helps with my horrible insomnia, but even if I can sleep through the stomach issues, I wake up feeling EXTREMELY nauseous. I don't use everyday, and take about a week break off and then a week on. Someone told me that the nausea would disappear with continuous use, but I don't want to use everyday. Do i just have to accept nausea as a constant side effect?

(Followed by some present day shit from real life at the bottom that's not orphan related),"


I don't know why I feel such a strong emotional connection to this story, but every time I've read it or played back the audio version of this book it pulls on my heart strings. The admiral and his space fleet of destroyers arrive in an Alliance controlled star system that is connected by a jump point to a former enemy star system. 


Ships full of refugees are floating all over the place. The local space and ground forces have been getting scaled back thereby making it impossible for them to solve the situation. It's hot mess but at least it's not a war zone. On the main inhabited planet is a military academy full of orphaned children. The president of the planet invited the admiral to visit the academy beceause one of the orphans is a descendant from a ship the admiral served on over a hundred years ago. Admiral John ""Black Jack"" Geary has only lived for over a century because he spent a long period of time in an escape pod in a state of technologically induced ""survival sleep"". 


&nbsp;


During the time in the star system the admiral has to find a peaceful solution to the refuge problem. Upon approaching a couple of the ships it is disovered that the life support systems were over-taxed. The fleet had to immediately get to task on hooking up fresh air chutes to the ships while also sucking away the putrid carbon-dioxide laden air. It's so sad thinking of those people all cooped up on an already crowded ship. As the air supply became limited, the operational crew members had to wear emergency breathing gear. It's shitty they can't share the emergency air supply but if the crew passes out everyone is definitely screwed.


&nbsp;

All this sad shit going on but there is a silver lining - the sadness and despair is countered by the acts of humanitarian kindness that Admiral Geary's fleet immediately engage in. Geary prefers to avoid parades and public appearances but of course he had to make an exception and visit the orphans - victims of a century long war where so many parents were inducted into the alliance space and ground forces never to come back home after perishing in battle. 


&nbsp;

What you just read is a synopsis of a portion of **The Lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier - Steadfast** by Jack Campbell. The audiobook narrator does an excellent job. This genre of military science fiction was written by a guy who knows he can make money if by writing a multi-part series. When he couldn't go any longer he wrote a few side stories including the revolution which occured in the Midway star system. 


&nbsp;

In this book series doctors can prescribe medication on an electronic device which prints out medicated patches on demand. Don't we all wish? I sometimes think about how the hypo-spray (needles in Star Trek) can be programmed on demand to administer just about any medication. Just imagine a junky with that.

&nbsp;

**It just occured to me** that I misplaced the three Suboxone pills that I bought the other day. So while looking around I found 2 more 2mg pieces. After my morning dose I had only three days left at 2mg. **Now I have five days of subs left at 4mg.** I'll most likely watch a bunch of hypnosis videos tonight to help me search my memory. 

&nbsp;

Not yet sure if I'll just aggressively taper down, buy more or get lucky and find that which I've misplaced.

Maybe 1.75mg tomorrow, down to 1.5 the following day. I know going from 2mg to 1mg might be too rapid, but I *believe* it should be sufficient. I don't know if I have the will power to just put myself down to 1mg in two days time. 

Sure hope I find that shit I misplaced. Should've secured it with certainty when I got home with it.",1531768343.0

I would just like something to watch and nod out to. 

Preferably nothing zombie related as I am not interested in shows about that. 

I’ve tried stranger things, wentworth, and breaking bad,  which people said were good but I couldn’t get into it... after watching 3 episodes (which I believe is enough to give a show time to catch my attention) 

I also have Hulu, but I can only watch that from my phone which I’m currently working on the handsmaids tale (I do not have cable so I watch that while I’m in bed) so preferably would like it on Netflix since I can stream that from my blu ray player. I can with Hulu also, but it only supports Hulu plus, & I have to wait for my free month trail to run out before I can upgrade to the plus version.

List of full rules and a short explanation of why they are in place.,"This sticky is in place because we are seeing an ever increasing number of members on mobile, who have never seen the rules, that are clearly visible on a computer and to explain why they are in place and clarify some things. If you have questions to ask feel free to ask them here or if you would like to privately discuss them with us hit [modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FOpiatesMods)
----

**1) This subreddit is 18+ only.**

> This rule is in place to ensure the longevity of this subreddit and prevent unwanted media attention if an unfortunate event were to occur involving a minor and this subreddit.

**2) NO SOURCING! Sourcing is any post regarding the acquisition of drugs, including legal substances, from a specific person or place, including other subreddit members, online markets, and/or vendors. Specific DNMs and/or vendors cannot be discussed.**

> This one should be pretty obvious and self explanatory, but we often see people who could not care less whether or not this place continues to exist to spread harm reduction, support, and continue to save lives for years to come. Reddit has banned many dozens of subreddits for allowing, promoting, or facilitating the trading or sale of even *legal* goods. This is the number one way to lose our beloved home.

**3) NO LOCATION-SPECIFIC POSTS! Posts about finding people in your city/state will be deleted and a ban may be issued. Anything that identifies a specific location will be removed-- this includes neighborhoods AND cities. States can not be mentioned when posting dope porn or when talking about not having any sources.**

>This rule is kind of an extension of the above sourcing rule, because when a location is named it inevitably leads to people from there talking about meeting up and doing things that are not permissible. There is often a lot of mod discretion used in regard to this rule due to harm reduction awareness, recovery resources, and other helpful things as such.

**4) GEO-TAGGED POSTS ARE NOT ALLOWED and will be removed regardless of context.**

>See above location rule for explanation. People try to use the geo tag feature on the app to subvert this rule and it is ultimately a slap in the face to the mod team and the people who care about this place.

**5) MEET-UPS ARE NOT ALLOWED for ANY reason! Any posts discussing, offering, or requesting meet-ups will be removed. We are not responsible for anything that happens outside of this subreddit.** 

>This goes hand in hand with the sourcing rule mentioned above and is against reddit TOS as well, it has also brought unwanted *major* media attention to this subreddit that ultimately reached literally *millions* of readers outside of the internet, we do not need a repeat.

**6) We are not doctors! Take any advice you are given at your own risk. If you believe it may be serious it is always better to be safe, than sorry. Go to a real doctor!** 

>If you are having a major medical problem **get off reddit and go to a doctor!** We cannot assume liability for misdiagnosing you which could ultimately lead to your death.


**7) No advertisements of any kind. This means no peddling products, treatment centers, or substances.**

>Plain and simple, we will not tolerate any advertisements at all, as many have ulterior motives behind them, such as the rehab/insurance fraud ones and so fourth.

**8) Absolutely NO begging, asking for money, or assistance of ANY kind other than advice. Any sub that claims to be affiliated with us, and is not in our sidebar, is a scam. Your post will be removed and you WILL be banned.** 

>There are places on reddit that offer assistance that will help you, this is not the place for this behavior. 

**9) Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others. Personal attacks or comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed and regular or egregious violations will result in bans. This means no trolling, bullying, hate speech, or personal attacks. Any hateful speech that is directed at a person will be removed.** 

>This is the longest written rule for a reason, *clarity!* Tl;dr: remember the human on the other end of the conversation and be civil. It is okay to disagree and civilly discuss things, but do not let it devolve into name calling and hateful attacks. 



**10) Protect your personal information, and that of other subreddit members! Posts that contain personal or identifying information will be removed and a ban may be issued.** 

>People have taken a tiny amount of info in the past and used it to harm individuals very badly on here, watch every little thing you post. There has been attempted extortion, people getting fired, police called, probations violated, and so much more done from one slip up and one asshole.



**11) Any post or comment that creates, or perpetuates, drama will be removed AND A BAN WILL BE ISSUED.** 

>Keep it civil, let it go.

**12) Journalists and/or Media personnel: Please PM the mods if you'd like your credentials to be verified. Otherwise, please do not solicit interviews or information from our members.**

>This is to keep everyone safe from any person posing as someone they really aren't and obtaining information about you or using it in a way which you did not intend.

#NEW/PREVIOUSLY UNWRITTEN RULES

**A) Posts requesting pill ID or press inquiries are not permitted.**

>As much as we wish we could tell you for sure that your pill is legit or not, there is no way to tell from some pictures on the internet. [Check out this post about all of the moulds available and info about pressed pills.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ky6ey/this_is_just_a_few_of_the_moulds_that_they_make/) What if a ton of people told someone their roxy was legit and it actually contained a large quantity of fentanyl and they died and their post was found? MEDIA BLAST! DEAD SUB!

**B) Basic questions answered by our sidebar, FAQ, or easily by google/searching the sub will be removed.**

> [See full explanation here. It contains tips on how to search more effectively and find the answer you are looking for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8kll5b/introducing_the_you_should_probably_just_google/) Knowledge is LIFE in this game we play! Do some research and educate yourself! If you truly can't find it, or can't understand the answer you did find, then post it with a link asking for an ELI5.



**C) Off-topic posting and discussion is permitted if it produces discussion, but is subject to removal at mod-discretion.**

> EXAMPLE OF WHAT WOULD BE REMOVED:
 
> *POST TITLE:* Ayyyyy yeeet!

> *CONTENT: *high af* 



**D) Memes posted in the last 30 days, or top 100 all-time may not be reposted and will be removed.**

**E) NSFW porn without drugs pictured is not permitted and should be shared on r/opiates_gonewild instead.**

> If it does contain nudity and drugs, please tag as NSFW.



**F) Candy posts without drugs pictured are not permitted.**

> It used to be a running joke when this sub was smaller about the candy we eat and Sour Patch Kids, but there was always actual content or a story behind it, now people just go to the candy aisle and take pictures of sour candy and post them. ",1531727421.0

I had a V today which smacked me in the face with a near instant high in 5 mins max compared to these E8s I’ve been getting that seem to take a minute. What do you guys think?

Favs in order

For smoking: Ms, E8, K9

Snorting: 54199 (God Tier Roxys, name brand Roxicodone all other brands are generics) 

A215\K9 as they seem to be near identical in size & taste. If I was blindfolded I could tell you the name of damn near every blue after crushing and railing but I’d never be able to tell the difference between A215/K9, the feel of the crush, taste of the drip, and amount of powder is nearly identical.

V’s I used to hate on these when I first started because they were harder to crush than others but I just got better at crushing em.. They seem to pack a punch and the drip taste great.

Spent 5 hours clutching my guts while hunched over a toilet puking and in pain so bad my vision was going blurry. Texted my wife to say I love her in case this is the day I finally die.

Then when the vomiting finally stopped I took a 20mg Oxycontin (I have no tolerance just prescribed to take as necessary). 1 hour later all my pain is completely dulled. It's there but it's kind of just a whisper in the background. I actually cried a little bit in relief. I can't believe how much the state of my reality has turned around.

I'm so thankful for the fact that this medication exists. It's the only thing that can take the pain away. I use it responsibility, as the doctor instructs, and I'm not physically addicted. It scares me to read stuff about how they want to make this harder to access. I don't know how I could survive if I didn't have a way to stop the pain.

I just don't understand how people in the old days survived without this stuff? What did you do if you got cancer? Stabbed or shot? Had a brain aneurysm?

I never ever use with random people. I am much older and should have known better. I was just on subs for a long time and forgot how the streets were therefore allowing me to get robbed and taken advantage of. 

We were both in detox and from out of state. She was 21 (F) and I am a very much older (F). When I got discharged she asked to come with me because her boyfriend she came down here with was extremely abusive. Something about her made me think of myself at that age. Innocent (HA!) and in an abusive relationship. So I said she could come hang with me. It was 4th of July and we rented a room until a sober house could become available after the holiday. (Great idea) it wasn’t too long before we were off to the races. I kept noticing my stuff being moved and I just thought she was stealing my cottons. Finally I flipped out and she swore she didn’t have anything she’s just airheaded. She said she had been to jail and they test you while you are in there. I knew nothing about this so I trusted her. Plus who would do such a thing?!! I never ever have shared a needle and I get tested religiously even after having sex with someone. After yelling at her for mixing up the needles a business card fell out of her purse for an infectious disease doctor. When I confronted her she locked herself in the bathroom and she was crying and screaming on the phone that she was scared and needed help. Meanwhile I was very calm and was just like why didn’t you tell me you have Hep C? Anyways I leave and call her “abusive ex” turns out not one thing she told me was true. She’s known she’s had Hep C for years and that he’s almost positive she’s positive for hiv as well. 

I feel so dumb. I am far too trusting. This was just supposed to be a fun, quick little relapse and now my life is changed and possibly ruined forever. 

EDIT: Anyone who has either or both please please please feel free to message me. I am freaking out. I am an alcoholic also so I have no clue how healthy I am. I have no idea what to expect. 

Imagine.... I spent all of my 20’s and half my 30’s shooting dope in a dark room alone. I decided to make a new friend and this happens. 

EDIT:  Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment, reach out or even read. Writing this all out gave me extreme anxiety attacks. If I haven’t replied to you please know I’m not ignoring you. I just need time to process it and come back. Thanks for letting me get this out. They said it usually takes 6 weeks to show up on a test so I’ll be tested then. ",1531714131.0

You see, Heroin to them is like vitamin C to us and they hailed Enterprise with their emergency beacon when they got low on rations after hundreds of years of drifting through space and began having to shoot up rinses and used cottons.

Were they opiates or other drugs?,"Just curious because I've been browsing around and reading up on withdrawals from various drugs. I binged OC 80's over the past year but never more than 1-2 weeks, and I personally feel pretty horrible withdrawals (obviously relative as heavier users will face much worse withdrawals). My withdrawals from opioids mainly consist of pain in my stomach, loss of appetite, insomnia, night sweats, RLS and diarrhea. However, this is how I would rank my worst withdrawals:

1) Getting off a 2 year habit of daily Clonazepam (Klonopin)/Lorazepam (Ativan)/Xanax (Alprazolam) habit. Obviously I started off at 0.5mg, then 1mg, then 3mg, 6mg. By the end of it I was doing 8-10mg usually half Clonazepam as soon as I woke up and then the rest Xanax throughout the day. I quit cold turkey because tapering never worked for me.

BY FAR the worst type of withdrawals I've ever experienced. The rebound anxiety was like no other. I had one of the worst panic attacks I've ever experienced. Ended up in the hospital because my parents thought I was dying. Luckily no seizures and the worst was over about 2 weeks after I quit.

2) Gabapentin/Pregabalin (Neurontin/Pregabalin): I'm mentioning this not only because of how bad the withdrawals were, but because many people think that these two drugs are relatively harmless and non-addictive. Well, I was doing anywhere from 900mg-1200mg of Pregablin some days, and 4500mg-5000mg of Gabapentin other days. The Gabapentin I would space out in 30 minute intervals throughout the entire day. I know this is A LOT more than most people take, but they gave me euphoria unlike any other (not as good as opiates though). At first, I didn't realize my withdrawal symptoms were caused by these gaba drugs. I suffered for several weeks with EXTREME pain in my stomach. I often resorted to Hydrocodone/Oxycodone to numb the pain. This accompanied severe cramps in my stomache and not eating at all. Overall, this wasn't as bad as getting off the Benzo's but it was much worse than any opioid withdrawals I've had.

3) Oxy/Hydrocodone: Now these two, I would only binge 1-2 weeks at a time and then taking another 3 weeks off usually. However, I was taking pretty high doses compared to my tolerance since it would somewhat reset every 3 weeks but I'd continue with the same dose I left off. Some of you may have seen my posts regarding tapering these last couple of days. I get similar withdrawals to gabapentin in that I have severe pain in my stomach, but it doesn't match the pain caused by the gaba drugs. Also, this time I am tapering off rather than quitting cold turkey so it's been a much better experience.

So that's my experience. How about yours?",1531705910.0

I've never had or seen the 214 before but they had a consistent color, held their shape when split in half except they didn't taste bitter like oxy which was my first red flag. I was sick when I got them so I took half and had a massive headache most of the day about 4 hours later I started feeling sick again. I couldn't sleep either, usually oxy at night before beds puts me out. So now I'm sketched out. Tried sucking one again, no bitter. Spit it out and dropped it in some water, didn't dissolve quickly like I read presses do. Anyway I was so skittish I made 8 pills last me 3 days and now I have my refill and the mbox 15s have that oxy taste and no headache. My usual feelings.  What test kits do you all recommend?

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4006196/#!po=40.8333

They examined the behaviour of crushed OxyContin (OC) pills in terms of bioavailability and max concentration.

What shocks me is they found an intranasal B.A. of about 77%, which largely exceeds the one found in previous studies (47%).

*Intranasal bioavailability of crushed OxyContin tablets in this study (~77%) exceeds its oral bioavailability estimated at approximately 60%. [ … ] However, the present bioavailability results exceed a previous report of 47% IN bioavailability of oxycodone solution administered by nasal spray, perhaps the only other study to date to examine the bioavailability of IN oxycodone.* ***The lower bioavailability in that study may be attributable to solution volumes exceeding the 0.3- to 0.4-mL nasal mucosa limit for absorption.*** *Thus, excess solution likely entered the nasopharynx and esophagus, becoming subjected to GI absorption and metabolism.*

If I’m not mistaken, this would contradict the popular claim that oral Oxy is better than snorted, at least when it comes to bioavailability.

EDIT2-- This isnt’t an **observation**, this is an experiment that was done by selecting people who weren’t dependant on any substance at the time. They were placed in a facility for two weeks prior to the study and tested everyday. The adults in question were recreational users of oxy who weren’t addicted, therefore the sample size is small. Statistical ignificance is still there in the test.

EDIT-- Just to clarify, the oral BA still can go upwards to 85% depending on individual metabolism but averages at around 60%, and it should take longer to wear off (lower peak concentration too)ct",1531697628.0

Show I went to a spine specialist and was told I had kyphosis a  curvature of the spine, the percentage it was curves was too far along for a brace and they said the only option was surgery( was having trouble breathing as my lungs were being crushed in my rib cage by how curved my spine was) so I got my first agonizing painful surgery long story short I left with 180 Roxy's and about a hundred and fifty 10s and a long skinny bottle of morphine that had refills it was the only thing that made me feel better enough to get up and walk around and do my physical therapy but my pain never truly went away 

about a year-and-a-half later I was getting fevers very sick vomiting overall s***** feeling found out I had an infection in my blood and in my bone partially where Hardware was attached to my spine causing the bone to die and Hardware to move around which caused unbelievable amounts of pain so I had to go in to get that taken care of not as bad as the first surgery as only the top of my spine with operated on but there is nothing like going through such an operation.. my surgeon was a dick and accused me of being a drug seeker even though I was only 14 years old and didn't know what these drugs actually were because when he asked how I was feeling I told him the only thing that makes me feel okay where the blue pills... little did I know

 so years later battling pain i strted going to a pain management doctor that I was prescribed 320 mg oxycontin a day my dumbass got addicted to cocaine and was using large amounts daily and for the first time in 6 years my doctor drug tested me I failed and lost 30 pills a month that I needed so looking for some sort of relief a friend offered me some heroin and that was my crutch just helping me pass the day by. Little did I know 2 months later I would get drug tested again and the morphine and codeine in my piss resulted in me losing my script no weaning off just dropped me I started using heroin daily at that point 

I stopped using heroin when my best friend overdosed and took his last breath in front of me I swore I wouldn't use it again but after spending roughly $30,000 of my savings(all I had) I had no choice but to go back to heroin as 35 a bundle is better than 30 a pill I've been trying to find a doctor for 4 years to no avail I go stick with them for a couple of months and they won't budge off of 10mg I use other people's urine just to get the clean pass or have low levels of Oxycodone in them- this year I was told that my pain is due to my bones never healing properly and the pain is worse than ever I'm losing feeling in my legs and tingling all over and they want to give me another operation which I flat-out refuse I can't go through such pain again all those little feelings that I remember are coming back to haunt me causing me not to sleep and getting so nauseous and turned off by the world I can't eat.  

I am currently on heroin and my small online business that is kept me a float for years is not bringing enough of income to pay for my habit and have money for anything else so I pretty much spend everything I have on dope and at the end of the day the pain is always there I just feel like my life can't go on much longer like this even though the same feelings years ago have brought me to where I am now I just wish a doctor would see me but there's no way I'm going to get 9 Roxy's a day plus breakthrough medication from any doctor here in the big city I've been to doctors all over and no one is willing to help me I even flat out told one doctor that I had to go to heroin after I lost my script and I know it's a liability but I am just trying to get my life back together back on my pills 

I don't know what to do anymore I'm in constant pain and severely depressed and have no money to do anything I have no room to grow in my industry with no seed money and I am trying to save but every time I have a little bit of savings it ends up going to dope because I can't work if I'm in pain and or sick I really don't know what to do I've tried so many doctors so many months wasted just trying to get me back to where I was with all of these indictments and things I see why they are scared to prescribe opioids but there are people in pain in need

I am scared to get this operation for many reasons one of the biggest being how could I deal with such pain on such low doses of opioids I'm scared waking up out of surgery and only having 30 mg to make me feel better is impossible and I would have to be doing dope in the hospital in recovery and they're on just making the cycle never ending I don't want to quit as opioids are the only thing since I was 12 years old that got me out of bed I'm scared to lose my life to this street cut bullshit and I just feel like at 23 years old my life is at a standstill my surgeon told me there are a couple of more operations I will have to endure to become completely better Spine and Neck and pelvis which is no question not going to happen I guess I rather just deal with the pain and scrounge together money to pay for this fuck in bullshit.. 

I have friends that are addicts and I wish that's all I was just an addict but in this scenario I am both an addict and a pain patient I was always functioning very well on my medicine making good money for my age and I have a good head on my shoulders I know I'm not like most people and I can get places in the world this s*** is just ruining me and I don't know why I can't find a doctor to help me in any way shape or form someone recommended me going to a doctor that is about a 30-hour drive which I laughed at because going across the country for a script just seems unreasonable to somebody who isn't faking an injury but maybe that's the only option I have it's not even like I have the money to go somewhere and sit around waiting to know if they will serve me or not..  

I don't do anything all day I sleep in depression eat and go back to laying down I am in pain that I can't describe in words and I am sick of feeling this way I know an operation isn't going to help cuz it was supposed to help the first and second time I just don't know what to think is my life over at this point sometimes I feel like I should just kill myself but my mom and grandma are the only things keeping me here I don't know how they would live without me as we are all we have

I will be next to my buddy and see him do a .3 shot and feel it after like 12 seconds or less, but when i do it I just sit there waiting for a good 3 miutes before I feel good. Could it be my circulation? I have a 110 resting bpm (no idea why, ive always been an anxious person), but I have very low blood pressure. Like so low that sometimes I will see flashing lights like im gonna pass out even just walking around, and if I sit up too fast i get tunnel vision or pass out. Are either of these a factor in how fast I feel IV heroin? Or is it something to do with my metabolism (low to medium low)?

The old man had bad luck.,"Before my hand came off the horn, an old man busted through the screen door with a bob and swing in his walk, an exaggerated limp. The racket of the door creaking open and clacking shut mixed into his belligerent squawking. There was no one except us, but he made accusations. He muttered curse words under his breath like he was spitting in disgust and climbed into the passenger seat. Travis squeezed between us.

“F\*cking imbeciles! I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. Just a pile of horse sh\*t!” Over time, I would learn that this was his default. Ninety-five percent of the time, he was this way, unless you had some coke or heroin.

“I know. I know,” Travis replied. “I talked to Zeke about it. He said he didn’t know anything about it and blamed it on Christine. I don’t believe it, though.”

Some drama I wasn’t privy to, but I found out later that Tom’s dog was missing. It was one of two times Zeke and his girlfriend, Justine, had stolen and traded the old man’s pure-bred Pekinese for a bag of cocaine to Freddy, a diabetic drug dealer in a dirty double-wide on the south side of town. He was unusually sweaty. His face looked like he was sucking a lemon, and the only hair he had was a werewolf patch on his right shoulder. Deep-pitted boils of brown covered his skin from his bald head to the stained waistband of his shorts. His shirt was always off. His health was always terrible, and he was always sweating.

(Once after Freddy moved to the north side of town, I saw him getting wheeled into the emergency room. I spent a lot of time at the hospital back then, and since I knew he was going to be checked in for a while, my friend and I burglarized his house. It was blatant and my S10 ran out of gas a quarter mile down the highway. Besides the safe, with some silver dollars and a couple of ounces of high-grade weed in it, the only thing I got was rinses out of his dirty heroin cookers. That was the main reason I broke in. We walked up to the Conoco and put gas with the silver dollars into a milk jug. His neighbors saw us do it, but New Mexico is a land of outlaws, and cops are rarely called.

Eventually the old man’s dog got eaten by coyotes in the sage brush behind my house after he moved in with me. The old man had bad luck.)

“Tom, this is Riley. Riley, this is Tom.”

“The indomitable Turtle, they can’t keep me down! Turtle Tom Stone! Pleased to meet you!” His tone and attitude completely changed. It was a show he put on; after all he was an entertainer in Woodstock, where he lived before and used to do drugs with the bass player of The Band. He stood in for Levon Helm when he was sick, because they were both singers/drummers. Levon couldn’t stand Turtle, though. He thought Tom was a piece of garbage.

We passed a pipe full of green hash and coughed, crammed in the tiny cab. Tom coughed hardest. He was 73 after all, but when he coughed a weird sound came out of his chest, like a marble rattling in a can of soup, probably from the wreck in the ravine. Travis looked at me horrified. Tom acted like he didn’t hear it and took every hit he could. On his move to out west, he had stayed in a hotel in Iowa where the toilet broke in half while he sat on it. The water damage was so severe that they wanted him to go to jail. Somehow, he lost his U-haul trailer with everything he owned because of it.

As we finally got out of town, whatever heroin Travis and Tom did before they found me mixed with the hash to soften the lines in their faces. Their mouths hung open and their chins were on their chests. The silence of sublime sleep filled the cab, but for the hum of fifth gear. To the left a vast expanse of desert territory summoned my imagination. They said it was still the wild, wild West out here, so I listened for the busting caps of antique six shooters and the thud of arrows through the necks of cowboys, shot from the bare backs of painted horses. Somewhere in the distant dust was the war cry of dark men with long hair and a caravan of covered wagons burning. It was faint, but I could hear it before the road dropped and rose back up toward Colorado.",1531669797.0

To answer some of the questions in that thread, I've always done binges of 1-2 weeks at a time, followed by decent to severe withdrawals depending on how severe my binge was. I always used OC 80s throughout this binge, chewed up and potentiated with grapefruit juice and tums. This latest binge was the longest/hardest and went something like this: 80mg, 80mg, 100mg, 80mg, 160mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 160mg (5 days ago). Followed by: 40mg, 40mg, 20mg (I didn't end up redosing that night), 10mg (yesterday, held down the withdrawal symtpoms). Today I decided to break the 80 into 5mg pieces. First I split 80 into 40, 40 into 20, here's where it got tricky. I broke the 20 into 4 pieces but they weren't really that even and really small pieces. I don't know if the 5mg will take care of withdrawals but I'm carrying another 5mg piece in case it doesn't take care of them. 

My withdrawals include night sweats, insomnia but worse of all: Pain in my stomach, loss of apetite followed by even greater pain in my stomach.

I know the suggestions offered a slower taper schedule than what I'm doing but it seems each successive day, half the previous dose takes care of the withdrawal symptoms. Since I dropped to 20mg and then 10mg, the withdrawals do return by night time but they aren't as severe and I manage to fight through the night. I will update in a bit to see if the 5mg took care of withdrawals or not. 

If it does take care of the withdrawals, you think a couple more days on 5mg and I can stop at that point? If the 5mg doesn't take care of withdrawals, how many days should I stay at 10mg before attempting to go back down to 5mg?

Instead I immediately proceeded to order a bunch of shit for my bike and turtles. Not a single regret or ounce of buyer's remorse as a result. 


&nbsp;


Finally spoke to my buddy Tim. He is still commited to staying clean as he was last week, I'm really glad that he meant it when he said he was planning to do this. He goes to N.A. meetings and gets his subs from a special program at the hospital where they don't give you a full month's supply which is really good for him. Tim has trouble taking his prescribed dose, by getting a specific amount administered to him, it prevents him from running out of subs early which has become a main reason for him to buy dope. 


He said some really positive shit when I texted him that makes me feel really good about him being okay. 


&nbsp;

I've considered going to N.A. meetings and as I taper down my subs maybe I should before seeking alternatives, such as buying dope. I was thinking about lying to Cliff and telling him that I'm going to N.A., but then I realized maybe I should actually go. Cliff still texts me every other day despite my being cold. He has asked why I never hang out anymore. This being a question that I answered succinctly.


Bottom line, I'm not doing dope and can't be near the temptation. If that's not enough of an explanation for Cliff, then I guess he can keep texting me until he gets the hint. 


&nbsp;


Some of his texts during the week said he ""didn't need anything"" from me but then on two of those days he texted me early-ish. Asked me to text him when I'm up or when I'm  having my ""morning java"". I didn't answer or pretended to be at work (unless I was at work). On one of those mornings he said ""I need to use your internet until I get paid tomorrow"", so there it was. He did need something from me after all. It won't cost me more to share my internet, unless we count the bed bugs.


&nbsp;

So what if I simply said to Cliff, ""my N.A. counselor says I shouldn't tempt myself, I'd like to hang out with you after I get some clean time."" Then I can guilt trip him if he tries to convince me otherwise and accuse him of getting in the way of my recovery. But alas, it's just easier and more courteous to keep it simple and maybe even honest.

Plus, I'd hate for Cliff to have nothing better to do than to spread the word that ""Sloan is attending N.A. meetings.""

I don't want his immediate family to know anymore than they do, especially his younger brother who has suspected that I'm an addict. Then we have Derrick the middle. I could totally see Cliff bringing me attending N.A. up to Derrick and Derrick deciding to run with it. He might forget or not care that I am trying keep a secret. His secret is out, and sense of honor cares not of keeping from exposing my secret.

Derrick's younger brother is successful, clean and judgemental. He may be a sex addict (literally) but he's above the addict's lifestyle when it comes to chemical dependence.

&nbsp;

Derrick's younger brother is so judgmental and would rat me out if he was a 100% sure I was an addict, might've ratted me out once already but without adequate proof the attempted intervention caught nothing. So there's no point in me telling Cliff I'm going to N.A., more bad can come of it.. but if I was to tell that to Cliff, I think I'd at least like to really be going to N.A.

&nbsp;


If I were to go to NA, I wouldn't want to talk about how I get my subs on the street, but don't they say honesty is really important? Can I show up and omit part of the truth? Then I think, how anonymous is N.A.? As a retail worker in a medium sized community there is a chance that... well, is that an issue? 


&nbsp;


I'm working on a story right now. It involves, a Mars colonist, his ex-wife acting strangely after doing business with a certain Clifford because her doctor stopped prescribing her pain meds. In this story it will be established and explained how Cliff became a giant mass of bed bugs. Like a shape shifter comprised from a colony of bugs that form the shape of a human body. 

Just not sure how they ""think"" but I'm thinking they (the bed bugs) gotta copy his memories somehow if the mass of bugs are to occasionally speak to people while convincing them that they are the original Cliff. I believe a doctor will discover that the bed bugs use a hive mind and chemical signals to replicate the operation of Cliff's brain. 

I'm thinking host body and parasites like Go'uld from Stargate but combined with Changeling characteristics and with the gawdyness of a 'Men in Black' alien posing as a human hidden beneath a clever facade.


&nbsp;

The alien mass of bugs that jacked Cliff's body don't have a car, a ship of their own or a means to top off the ship's deuterium reserves. This is not to say that deuterium is not super common. Heck, the aliens of this autonomous hive mind have the means to turn hydrogen into deuterium but they're too lazy to transport the water and they can't travel too close to the Sun either.

As it would turn out, the alien Bed Bugs sought out a mind that was compatible with their own. This particular sub-hive had borrowed the spacecraft from their collective because they claimed it was a need and an ""emergency"". The collective provided a worn down ship because this particular sub-hive had the tendency to borrow things and not return them in their original condition. 

&nbsp;

As it stood, they owed 30,000 space-bed-bug credits as a result of past unpaid loans. The one thing about running debts with a collective of bed bugs is that it's like a blockchain. As long as more than 50% of the collective retains the memories of a debt it'll remain ""on file"" in a sense. Copies are transmitted via unfalsifiable chemical signals.

The result, the collective didn't refuse to help, they didn't even bother transmitting their response. 

&nbsp;

Without a response from the collective, the mass of bed bugs that comprises what appears to be Cliff's body had to make preparations to get off this rock themselves. Since there's too many bed bugs to fit in a single body, they can't form up to replace an astronaut to get into space and even if they did - the mission would get scrubbed if a single bed bug was caught running around the ship. Unless the Russians don't care about that kind of thing since we are hitching rides on their launch vehicles.

&nbsp;

Speaking of ship, our ship technology would not get them into the higher orbit that would be needed. The alien ship, more like a shuttle.. is in a higher orbit just waiting to be refueled. If the bugs are able to deliver deuterium to the alien bed bug ship, they can report back to their planet with their findings. A whole planet full of potential human host bodies would at least cause their governing authority to expunge the sub-hive's many debts. 

Since this sub-hive plans on earning so much money from discovering the humans on Earth, they decided to take after the mind of their host's body and buy some heroin. The sub-hive of bed bugs can share the dopamine signals by using their own chemical signals and antennae to emulate synaptic connections.


&nbsp;

So that's the rough version of how a mass of Bed Bugs replaced most of Cliff''s body and why he is an alien who might someday warrant a visit from the MIB.",1531663264.0

Now i have no criminal record and have a lot of responsibilities in my life, so i cant afford to get busted or get my ass whooped.

One dude replies. Asks me if im mobile. I reply and say that i am and that i would like to try before buying. He says okay and tells me to meet at a close by shopping center, like a 5 minute drive. 

Theres a starbucks in the shopping center, i say lets meet inside there, hand me a piece, ill smoke it in the bathroom, and if its legit, ill give you the cash and we can execute the transaction. He says ok.

So the positive signs are that 1) public place, 2) i get to try it first, 3) guy is italian. My gut tells me it looks good.

I go to the starbucks and im standing outside. The dude is running a little late, bad sign. I call him, he says hes parked far and that hes walking to me. I thought that was kind of odd. I describe what im wearing. So im standing there and crossing my fingers. 

Dude walks up, gives me the ""are you him?"" look/body language. I nod. Right off the bat, he looks really non threatening. Hes wearing shorts and a t shirt n slippers, so he cant possibly have a weapon. We walk to the back of the starbucks. He shoots me a piece from the bag hes about to sell me. I go in the bathroom. That piece makes me well. I have a little mini celebration in front of the bathroom mirror. You did it you fuckin junkie, good job. I exit the bathroom, swap cash for roofing material, and say thanks. Dude says to save his number n he says can get me virtually anything i need.

Good shit. So i got a new hook who so far has been very puntual. His shit is decent and the price okay, but he came thru when i was desperate. Crisis averted.

I recently acquired these from a friend who's relative passed away after a years-long battle with cancer.  They left behind 9 patches.  Having never tried fentanyl before, I was pretty wary to mess with these.  I've experience with every other opiate under the sun besides RC's, even heroin, but these patches have a **72 HOUR** time release, and a total of 5.50mg of fentanyl each.  Everything I read about using these recreationally gave the same advice -- DON'T 

However, I decided to tread lightly and smoke/vape some.  I started with a tiny sliver off the corner, which I felt nothing from.  Then after 20 mins or so, I cut a small square, smaller than a standard tab of acid, and vaporized that.  I felt a slight body high come on over the next 10 mins or so, but no rush as I would expect from smoking something stronger than heroin, so next I cut a slice off long-ways, about the same width as the square I cut, and rolled this into a spliff, so that the center of the joint contained the long slice of fentanyl patch, evenly distributed across the length of the spliff.  I figured this way, when I felt it hitting me, I could put it out, never getting more at once than I had initially tested.  (Important I also had a sitter present)  Half way through the joint I did catch a strong buzz, and I chose not to finish it, though I could have smoked the rest and been fine, as I found out in my later experiments.  

It works quite well!  Probably not great for the lungs, but it takes such a small amount, it's not so bad.  The flavor is masked by the weed/tobacco unless it's vaporized straight.  Nice novelty opiate smoking experience.  I give it a 7/10, would/will probably do again until I run out of patches lol",1531649753.0

I need insane amounts of opiates/opioids to get high. Enough that would OD the opiate naieve.,"My body has a permanent naturally high baseline tolerance to opiates/opioids. I could go months to years without taking opiates and still need like 60 mgs of hydrocodone to get high. Never have gotten high from codeine. I need like 50 or so mgs of oxycodone and at least 4 mgs of Dilaudid IV to get a decent rush. I need at least 8 mgs of Dilaudid IV to pin my pupils and get a badass/good rush. Because of this I've always feared not getting enough pain meds prescribed if I needed them for pain. Especially in today's circumstances where they're scared to prescribe Tylenol 3s. You've gotta be lucky to get Vicodin or better. In most situations you're going home with 15-30 tramadol tablets or 10-20 Tylenol 3s. My aunt is in chronic pain management for Crohn's disease and she gets like 90 Vicodin 10/325s a month and has been for like 8 months. She keeps asking for more or something stronger but her doctor just says that he's not going to throw pills at her and also says to just trudge through the pain.

tl;dr I need these dosages to get high with a baseline tolerance

Codeine (Tylenol 3/4)  - Doesn't get me high

Hydrocodone (Vicodin) - 60 mgs+ IR (oral)

Oxycodone (Percocet, Oxycontin) - 50 mgs+ IR (oral)

Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) - 4-8mgs+ (IV) (preferably 8mgs, 4 will give me a rush but I need 8 to pin my pupils)",1531649396.0

Was thinking of just doing 30mg and seeing what happens and if worse comes to worse I will catheter myself because I cannot go to the hospital due to other scripts I have. Any suggestions on how to prevent it, or is this just a bad side effect i have to deal with? ",1531618382.0

He left his plugs number in my phone. In reality he’s screwed himself, but I’m not sure what I’m gonna do about it.","So I’ve been getting some things from this dude who’s homeless and his phone shit the bed a few weeks ago. I gave him some money to cop for me and he called his dude from my phone and didn’t delete the number. I let him hold the $80 and came back 30 mins later to a note at his camp saying he got robbed. I was genuinely concerned for he and his GF so I waited at the bus stop nearby to wait and see if he comes back and make sure he was ok. 

10 mins later a dude rolls up and passes by me 3 times, finally he stops and asks me “hey do you know Alen and Kristen?” I say “yeah, I’m waiting on them. apparently they got robbed, I’m supposed to get some methadone from their dude.” 

He says hop in, we go up the street and I get some more cash, make a deal w him and he tells me to call him anytime. We hit it off great, we’re from the same hood and he’s pumped to have met me. Turns out he’s got blues, boy, girl, hard and methadone on deck all day. Good prices and great quality too.

Typically I stay away from doing frequent biz w folks that are so deep into their addiction, but he’s had a tough time and has really helped me out in the past quite a few times. I always gave him and his girlfriend some extra money, food, clothes, shoes, supplies etc. I gave him a pair of Nikes and a North Face back pack. I even told them I was gonna give them an old iPhone and always told them if they’re sick and short on cash to hit me up and I can kick em $5 from time to time to help out. I was gonna hook him up w my buddy whose always looking for helpers in the job site too, even knowing full well he’s an addict and a liability he’s been there and is willing to give ppl a chance. 

Unfortunately the temptation of $80 got the better of him and he took off w my cash and spent it on dope and coke. I know this for a fact bc his dealer told me so. He gave them a rash of shit for doing it too and told them if he ever does some shit like that again he’ll cut them off.

He panhandles up the street from my house, I see him all the time but he doesn’t see me or know where I live. I’m not even gonna bother confronting him. I know exactly what he did, so hearing him lie and watching him squirm isn’t even worth it. 10 years ago I would have knee capped him and taken everything he had, as you get older you start to see the other side of the coin a lot more. It was my dumbass fault for letting him hold $80 to go cop for me, and in the long run he’s screwed himself more than anything. He woulda made way more off me as a middle than keeping that $ and I woulda really helped him out too. 

Am I pissed about the money? You fucking bet, and I’m still not gonna let it fly, but I haven’t made up my mind on what I wanna do. I’m willing to bet he actually feels bad about it, but there’s no way on gods green earth he can pay me back. It’d be one thing if I were serving him but I don’t hustle so there’s no reason for him to pay me back. It’s been four days since that happened and I still don’t know what I’m gonna do about it.

8ywusy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ywusy/dentist_prescribed_too_much/,24,https://redd.it/8ywusy,Jumpman-x,Dentist Prescribed Too Much.,"Good Evening, everyone. Didn't know where to post this... seems like the right sub.

About 6 days ago, I had half my wisdom teeth extracted. Some deep-rooted teeth and it wasn't as simple as some people's teeth (needed a lot of drilling, etc.) And I obviously plan on going back to take care of the other half, just don't know when. I don't have insurance so just two teeth cost me about $900.

The Dentist or assistant, whatever, said they're going to give me double the pain meds for this post-op and to have the rest for my next extraction ( I even said mid-surgery ((No Twilight, too much $$, went with Novocaine)) that I didn't have another appointment yet).

So I get to the pharmacy and they give me 24 Oxy/Tylenol pills. Now, I haven't taken this stuff since I was a derelict in HS. So one makes my face feel better, two gets me sick if it's taken too soon, and so on. So now, 6 days later after taken about 3-4 for the first few days and now one at night to help me stay focused on course-work and bed, I'm down to about 9 left. 

This worries me for two reasons: 1) I really do not want to become dependent on this stuff. Seen it happen to a lot of friends, besides it would soon run out and then I'd have withdrawal issues. And more importantly 2) When I go back I wouldn't have any more to ease the large amount of pain I'd be dealing with all over again.

I'm pretty pissed at the dentist office for thinking this is okay. Like honestly, who the hell would give a 22yr old 24 Oxys for what should only be a 4-5 days of recovery? And I don't even have another appointment set up, because I simply cannot afford it right now. 

So I guess I'm looking for advice. I really just want to get rid of these things, flush em' down the toilet and call the office on Monday and tell that it was too much of a liability to have these lurking around. And next time when I go back, to only prescribe... I don't know... maybe 8? But how can they even be sure I'm telling the truth? This is a stupid situation. How did they think most people have the willpower to take pain meds for days in a row then just put em' in a drawer for two months? Ridiculous.

Thanks for any wise-words in advance. Kinda baffled right now. Have a good day/night everyone!",1531605812.0

Was feeling pretty good, and once those wore off decided to do more because why not, it was a Friday night after all. I was at a very comfortable level, everything was warm and fuzzy and I had lit some candles...a good atmosphere right? So why not do just a little bit more?  Why not finish off the bag? Only I didn't wait until the last dose had worn off before I took a line because for some reason I thought I could handle it. I couldn't. About 10 minutes in I started to feel a little delirious and my pulse was weird. I also had to think about breathing which....is not normal. I had turned all the lights off and was listening to music when things started to sound a little warped and a voice in one side of my head said ""Drink"". It was odd because it sounded like a voice outside of my head even though no one was there. That's when I realized I might be overdosing. So I spent the next hour or two trying stay awake, drinking water, eating blueberries, trying to make myself puke, and even putting salt under my tongue. At the end of it my pulse felt normal again, my breathing was okay, and despite the fact my eyes kept rolling around I decided to call it a night. Woke up this morning and felt like shit, but that was to be expected. 

So was it a near OD? I have no idea. Might be due to the fact I did coke and molly the night before, might be due to the fact I did too much in one go. All I know is I'm laying off it for the next week or so. ",1531602554.0

I've been saving as much cash as I can and using littler amounts than usual in order to try and get my tolerance down. My plan was to procure some Suboxones and then use those to get through until I got paid at my new job, that way I could save my cash i currently have for food and gas during those few weeks.

Well finding subs has been extremely difficult, as everyone who says they can get them has flaked out or some other bullshit.

Earlier today I decided I’d use the rest of my heroin to kill myself. I used 60mg of some strong China white that I assume was cut with some fent, as it felt a little like fent from the times that I used it. 

After loading up my rig (and putting on a nice song to die to), I found a nice big vein in my elbow-pit. I thought about my girlfriend and started to cry, but not for long as I was shaking too much to stab into the vein. I wiped my tears, and slipped the spike into my vein. I pushed down the plunger. 

I could taste it. 
I felt extremely dizzy and nauseas, so I decided to lay down. My vision was very wonky, and I thought to myself briefly that maybe I was just going to nod out real hard...

I open my eyes. There’s unfamiliar faces looking down at me. I don’t understand what they’re saying to me, but their mouths keep moving.
I feel disoriented. 
After I come to, I realise they are paramedics. They tell me that I’ve overdosed on heroin, and that they are going to take me to the hospital. Fuck. 
Fucking christ. I almost died, I was so close. I should have waited until nighttime when nobody was home. 

Oh well, at least my family is happy I’m alive. And my girlfriend. This was my big chance for an easy way out, and I blew it. I’m too poor to buy more dope. Oh fucking well, I guess. ",1531594170.0

Everywhere we went, our environments changed to match the death inside of us, but we lied about it to ourselves and to everyone else.  None of us believed it, but we lied about that too and pretended this was what we wanted.

We did meth and heroin and smoked cigarettes in his room, dubbed the shooting gallery.  Tom needed a medical detox, but he had a habit of saying he was going in and not doing it.  I dropped him off before a six-hour shift at Ogelvie’s one morning.  When I came back to the house, I went into his room to find information on how to visit him at the facility, but he was sitting in his bed smoking a cigarette.

“How’d you get out of detox? Or did you ever go?”

“They kicked me out.”  

“They kicked you out?  Why?”

“Too much trouble.  They said they weren’t prepared for me.  Too much sh\*tting.  Too much runny nose.  Said they didn’t expect me to be sh\*tting all over the place like that.”

On another morning I opened my eyes to see him sliding his thermal underwear over his foot.  It was the first thing I saw, and the fabric got caught on his big toe nail.

“Come on, you f\*cking b\*tch!”  He screamed at his underwear and pulled harder.  He ripped the big toe nail out of his foot.",1531581972.0

I have been on methadone for a few weeks after being on a opiate habit with a tolerance for at least 200mg of oxy at a time. I am slowly going up in dose on methadone, currently at 35mg. I notice if I take it on an empty stomach, within an hour I start feeling warm, euphoric and content, which lasts for several more hours.

I understand methadone is a strong opiate and full mu agonist, thus the effects, but how common is this? Will it keep on happening as my dose is increased by 5mg every 3-5 days?

Kick? maybe that is the best option but the withdrawals which I luckily haven't felt for months (thanks to the aforementioned amazing dealer, dope and supply of money) is scaring me.

Kratom might be something I could try for WDs. 

Moving sucks, especially when everyone is happy you have to fake being happy too while desperately trying to stay sane and not go crazy. Oh did I mention the 2 day long journey (with overnight breaks?) 😓

At least there might be one good thing if the ""Rat Park"" experiment was true than the change of scene and getting myself to go out and do things will help me not feel so terrible.

Here's an update, big things happened today.","I posted last night about me telling my GF about my addiction problems in the past and how the last few months I relapsed. She didn't take it so well at first, but by the end of he night she was supportive. Of course she has every right to be upset with all the lies I've told her and all the money of hers I've spent on my habit instead of bills. I know I'm the problem and I deserve any anger she has. I also came clean to my parents yesterday. I had come clean to my dad a couple months ago, but not the full truth. As of yesterday they both knew the full truth. I asked them for help to pay my rent since I was way short on it. They told me they would help, but they wanted me to come down and visit them next week. I was completely planning on coming down to see them. I'm fully committed to staying clean this time. I wouldn't have spilled my guts to them and my girl if I wasn't. 

Here's where things take a turn. Wake up to a phone call this morning from them. They spent the day yesterday researching and talking to an addiction counselor and they want me to talk to him. I get a call from him and talk. It was a nice conversation until he tells me my parents aren't going to help me out with my rent unless I go to rehab. I don't want to leave. I feel like since I told my girl I have all the support I need. That may just be me trying to bargain. But honestly there have been many times during my addiction that I would have loved to go to rehab, but this is not one of those times. My wds aren't even that bad. I could definitely get clean with my girls support. I don't want to leave her. I don't want to lose this great new job I was going to start in 2 weeks. But ultimately I know having treatment can only benefit me. It's going to put a strain on my relationship with me being gone for 2 to 3 months. I'm hoping we can pick up where we left off, only I'll be a better person and partner. 

Today did not go the way I expected it to go. I leave tomorrow for rehab in another state in a different time zone. My first rehab and hopefully last. It's not the rehab that I don't want to do. It's that I don't want to leave my girl all by herself. She has bad anxiety and panic attacks that sometimes turn into self harm. I hate to leave her all alone. She has her parents right down the road, but I'm her rock. That's what's got me shook up the most, is leaving her. It's my problem and I should have to pay for it, not her. 

 If you read this and/or my other post, thank you. I'm just rambling really, this whole thing is so surreal right now. Less than 24 hours ago I told my girl about my problem, and in about 12hrs I'm getting on a plane to rehab. This shit is crazy.",1531532800.0

I called my surgeon for a refill and was denied...I live in * redacted* and they don’t fuck around with opiates. You get one shot before they call it and don’t want any more blood on their hands. 
I got my boss (I am a dental assistant) to write me an RX for Tylenol 3...which sucks, but is better than nothing if you take them 2 at a time and have a low tolerance like I do...low-ish. It’s getting higher, as my highs still happen, but don’t seem to last as long which is bumming me out. 
I went back to my surgeon today and he wrote me a script for Gaba. I didn’t know you could get high off this, but after some digging, I figured it out. 
My problem is I am running out of options, and I am too in love with this feeling. 6 weeks post op means no one believes you are in that much pain anymore. 
I am breaking my Tylenol 3 in half to mix with the Gabs to try and stretch it for 2 weeks until my 8 week apt where I can hopefully get 1 more script for something.

8yob8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8yob8m/remember_the_numbers_on_the_fridge/,25,https://redd.it/8yob8m,ASavageLost,"""Remember, the number's on the fridge.""","The light changed from black to early morning blue to winter white and back to black through the bedroom windows three or four times. I didn’t know. I only knew that a long time had passed while I lay goose fleshed and slimy under the covers. There had been sounds of water running through the pipes in the wall as I struggled to sleep, doors opening, doors closing, my aunt getting my three-year-old cousin ready for school and clanging pots and pans to cook for the family. I listened through the closed door. My uncle cleared his throat from time to time in the hallway as if making angry slights at me and my detoxing presence on his mattress in his house. He didn’t speak much.

Terrifying visions of Jeff being scraped off the road into a shoebox or a demoniac version of my friend Rufus or my father snapping my mother’s neck until she flopped strangely and heavily in his hands interrupted every five-minute bout of sleep in the dark.

I woke up after those nightmares with my feet on the headboard or walking up the wall and wrapped up miserably in the sheets. Tingly warm sweats turned into horrifying chills. The taste and smell of soggy cigarette butts emanated from what I imagined to be a gelatinous black mold cultured in the recesses of my lungs. Sometimes it was old blood or burnt match sticks I smelled and tasted, and the raw pink flesh of my sinus cavities seemed dried and stuck to the back of my tongue. I yawned. Droplets of water ran from each nostril. My guts had no ammunition as I had not eaten, but I could hear the pans again and my aunt cooking breakfast for her small family. However strange and alien the concept seemed to me and however much my new uncle probably hated me, this was my family. The door opened. My aunt whispered,

“Clyde. Clyde. Are you awake, honey?” I moved slowly in the bed and moaned acting like I was asleep. It was something I had done my whole life when people woke me up, some sort of attempt at making them feel guilty for interrupting my rest. “Honey, we’re having breakfast. You need to eat.”

I rolled off the bed. I spoke no words to her, but she waited with a smile. My left leg gave out under me putting me on my butt. She stood leaning into the room through the door and the yellow hallway light pouring over the back of her shoulders and head like some angelic vision, gentle and beautiful and full of maternal compassion. I fell onto my side and moaned, wallowing in burning muscle misery, fluid running from my face. Finally, I got up and snuck past her into the bathroom across the hall to wash my eyes out.

My aunt knocked on the door saying, “Clyde. There’s a new toothbrush in the drawer for you. You can use some toothpaste. Hurry up, though, breakfast is getting cold.”

I had pupils the size of someone who had eaten acid. The mirror was not my friend. Cold water helped rub the film of filth from my skin, and it burned when I urinated, probably just from getting everything up and working again versus venereal disease. Orange pee sunk directly to the bottom of the toilet bowl, instead of dispersing throughout the clear water and smelled like sugar smacks.

Walking into the smoky kitchen, my uncle looked up from feeding and talking sweetly to my little cousin and scowled at me. My cousin threw her hands up towards me. She was excited. She said,

“Hi, Cwyde! I’m Bonnie. I’m your widdle cousin, Cwyde!”

I smiled, which hurt my face and head to do.  My uncle avoided looking at me any more than he had to by insisting Bonnie eat some more and focusing on feeding her. My aunt put a pancake on a plate and a piece of bacon with a fork and handed it to me.

“There’s a glass in the cupboard there. Help yourself. Milk’s on the table.” She turned towards the faucet running water over a mixing bowl and the pan which sizzled in the sink.

“Cwyde. I’m going to school today. My mommy’s going to work.”

“That’s cool.” I said trying to sincerely engage the child in front of her parents, wondering if I was doing it correctly.  They didn’t say I wasn’t. It seemed okay.

“Yeah! Are you going to work like big people do? My daddy’s a grown up. He says that’s why he has to go to work.” She asked. I had put the first sticky piece of pancake into my mouth and was pouring a glass of milk while I chewed. The question embarrassed me.

“No, sweetie. He’s not going to work today. Your cousin Clyde is sick, baby.” My aunt interrupted.

“Sick? Why’s he sick?”

“He’s just not feeling well honey. He’ll go when he get’s better, baby.” My aunt turned to me. “Steve’s got a friend named Darryl who manages a warehouse. He said it’s really hard work, but the pay is good. It’ll be a good job.”

“Thanks. I’m not sure when I’ll be ready to work. I don’t know when. Just not yet.”

My uncle Steve, who I preferred to think of as my aunt’s new husband putting distance between us and removing his position in my life as someone I needed to respect or care about, spoke the first words he ever spoke to me. “Not ready, huh?” He clutched the pink, plastic fork he was using to feed little Bonnie in a fist pointing it at the ceiling. “I’m not ready to go to work today, myself. Jolene, you think I could just stay in? I’m not ready for it?”

My aunt rolled her eyes at him. “Steve, you knew good and well this was how it would be. Be patient. Clyde’s going to get to work with Darryl soon enough.”

“Darryl needs someone who can actually work. I’m not sure we know anyone who fits that description here.” He looked right at me. I took another bite of pancake. I took a bite of bacon. “Jolene, I’m taking off. Do you have Bonnie?”

“Yeah, Steve. I’ve got her.”

“Give daddy a kiss, baby.” He leaned into his daughter’s face.

She gave him a kiss. “I wuv you, daddy. Have a good day.”

“I wuv you, too, little one. I love you so much.” He picked her up in his arms and squeezed her tight. I watched, angry at him and jealous of the love he showed my little cousin as her father. He set her down, gave my aunt a peck on the cheek and walked out through the front door.

Before the engine turned over in the driveway, my aunt turned to look at me and said,

“Sorry, Clyde. It’s kind of how he is. He doesn’t understand.”

“I get it.” It was a hard reality to swallow sitting at the kitchen table, my cousin looking up at me and having been humiliated by my uncle. I lost it all. Everything I had on the streets, the respect, the power to hurt people, the drugs and the freedom, it was all gone. Coming here had emasculated me in a way I had not been since before I left.  I had been castrated.

My aunt walked over to me and put a hand on my shoulder. “It’s going to be okay.” She sat down next to me. “Do you remember your mother?” Of course, I remembered my mother. “You remember when you used to make all those potions?” I had gone through a period in my childhood of mixing up random liquids in cups and jars and calling them potions. “Yeah. You had quite the imagination then, Clyde. One time you froze one of those potions in a mason jar, but you were so little, you didn’t get it into the freezer well enough and when your mom came to open the freezer that night with no shoes on, your potion had turned into a ten-pound rock of ice and it fell on her middle toe. You remember that?”

“I do.” It had been completely absent from my mind, like it was part of another person’s life and memory. Now I remembered it. It was a hidden parcel part of a life I had forgotten existed, life as a child with my mother and sister, when things were bad, but I was too little to know just how bad.

My mother’s soft pale skin and the smell of the cream she rubbed on her sun spotted chest at night before we slept and the nightgown she used to wear. There were freckles on the backs of her hands and shoulders. When that frozen mason jar fell out of the freezer and broke her toe, it ballooned and turned ugly blue and purple and green. Eventually, the black toenail fell off. She was sweet and soft when she spoke to me about how there would be no more potion making, and she laughed when she recounted the story to people. There was the time we spent months in the battered woman’s shelter, and the night my sister wet her bed there.

My aunt continued. “She would be proud to see you trying like this. She would be proud to see you giving it your best shot and sticking it out. Don’t worry about Steve. He’ll come around, if you give it your best. He’s not a bad guy. He just doesn’t understand.” She looked at me. I looked at her. Little Bonnie stood by the couch in the living room and played with a plastic dinosaur and barbie doll. My aunt was younger, as I had known her. Now her voice had changed. It was deeper. Her neck was thicker and skin looser. The creased wrinkles in her lips showed gave witness to her cigarette smoking. Her make up and lipstick seemed to cover up flaws, rather than augment her beauty to perfection like it did when I was a kid. “Anyway, I’ve got to get to work and drop Bonnie off at daycare. Your sister wants you to call her.”

“Tammy? She wants me to call?”

“Yeah. Her husband’s home from work for the week. They had a baby a month ago, but it was almost five weeks premature. She just got home from the hospital and wants to see you. They said they’ll come visit with the baby, whenever you’re ready.”

“I don’t know.” I hadn’t known she was married or pregnant. 

“It’s your sister, Clyde. When’s the last time you talked to her? Before you left?”

“Something like that. I think I talked to her on the phone when I was in that rehab in Nevada.”

“Okay. Well, I’ll leave the number on the refrigerator. You can use the landline. Bonnie, let’s go baby. It’s time to leave. Clyde, eat whatever you want. I’ll be back before Steve, probably before three.”

“Thank you, for everything. I mean it.”

“I love you, Clyde. You’re my sister’s only son.  Before Bonnie, you and Tammy were the only kids I had. Remember, the number’s on the fridge.”",1531520076.0

From a [scientific article](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/34/3/355/388050) on the subject:

>Because enteric pathogens are killed within seconds by boiling water and are killed rapidly at temperatures >60°C [or >140°F], the traditional advice to boil water for 10 min to ensure potability is excessive. Because the time required to heat water from a temperature of 55°C [or 131°F] to a boil works toward disinfection, any water that is brought to a boil should be adequately disinfected. Boiling water for 1 min or keeping water covered and then allowing it to cool slowly after boiling can add an extra margin of safety. 

I hope that clears things up. At that temperature it doesn't matter how long because it's already more than high enough to kill the bacteria instantly. It's only for an ""extra margin of safety"" that they recommend boiling it for longer. 


Now I have heard the legitimate idea that you should not boil *the dope and the water together* because it can increase the dissolution of cuts. This is fair, but at the same time, you can get around this by heating the water and dope separately before mixing them (you could easily do this by dipping the closed bag of dope in the water as it's boiling), which gives you the best of both worlds. 


You will not lose any dope heating to 100 degrees C, the boiling point of diamorphine HCl is 273°C, way above that.

I've read the research papers etc. that pretty much explain tapentadol is more potent and doesn't carry as much of a risk for serotonin syndrome, but other than that I can't seem to find any anecdotal evidence on what the actual effects feel like.

So my question to any of you who have tried both - which do you prefer and why? For both pain relief AND recreational value.

Also please refrain from the ""don't get muddled up with opiates"" line, I appreciate what you're doing but I've had plenty of long conversations with other opiate users and I'm fully aware of what I'm doing :)

OK when u walk up and ask the person whether tthe same rules always apply. If its a middle first off make it clear that youre going to hook them up and with exactly what theyll be getting  and that u u only want to buy a dub or a 30(important)also before they even call their dude  tell them right away ur not new to the game an have been bopped before  so your money doesnt walk,  and u need to be able to peep the dope real quick while the dealer is still in the immediate vicinity otherwise u will walk away from the deal even if the dealers already there. now barking out all these demands makes u come off like a prick kinda and while it makes it more likely youll get jacked heres the kicker,  on the way to meet the dboy casually bring up to the middle that ur only connect got popped and u haven been able to find a steady source and are sick constantly, **  and be very convincing that u have another 200-300 bucks at the house ur tryin spend so youll be ok for a few days and  if the dope u guys are about to get is good and the deal goes good  youll be comin right back, u just have to test the waters first( then ask for their phone number or where u can find em  when u go grab ur money) ** if the middle has been plotting on u the whole time, after hearing ur story almost all junkies will choose to hook u up right then with the 20 or 30 instead of jacking u cause theyre getting a get well out of it anyway and thinking theyre setting u up to jack u for the 200 when u come back..

Now I am actually very excited about this because I will be out of that area and be able to maintain my sobriety. We are planning on moving out there mid September so I have some time to get clean. 

I recently completed a 30 day inpatient rehab but unfortunately I relapsed and have been using every day for about a month now. I'm thinking I will do an 8-10 day rapid sub taper during the move and completing it once I am in Ohio so I don't have the option to get high. I feel like if I try to get clean before the move I will ultimately end up using again, this is why I want to begin the taper a few days before the move and finish it once we are in Ohio. 

I know there is plenty of dope in Ohio but I will not be actively searching for it. The problem with Philly is that it's an open air market so I can't just delete phone numbers. 

I'm wondering what you guys think about my rapid sub taper and if there is anything else I could consider. I will also be using some type of benzo to help with the detox. 

I'm open to any suggestions and they would be much appreciated. ",1531504931.0

He is depressed. Dissociated from reality. Merging with the greater consciousness we still cant be so sure of. 

When i close my eyes i can see glimmers of the ghosts of old souls before me. I sing in the shower to them. They sing with me. 

The drugs dont work anymore. Everything just feels fuzzy, sickly cold and grey. I hate waking each morning in a panic state due to a self-inflicted wound. A chemical imbalance off the scales created by my own doing. Opiates. Coke. Amphetamines and all other flavors of downers too. Who would've thought gaba agonists would turn out to be my downfall? Someone with severe anxiety gravitating towards relief, over and over. Never would've seen that coming...

It feels as if im running headfirst into an invisible brick wall forever. I have this obsession with violence in this state. I wanna hurt someone or myself. My heartbeat rises just writing this, just imagining scenarios in which i lose control finally and do something i deeply regret. Or who knows? Maybe that is what i need. 

""Youre standing on the ledge, why don't you jump you fucking pussy?!"" 

I ask God to bail me out of this somehow. Give me a sign to work with. Mostly i ask him to help my love (just answer her please?) and my family. Ive already moved from my own existence.  I dont need nor want help. However i seem to be chosen for something. I cant die. Ive tried. Crashing cars while high never work. We just got unstuck and kept on going. 

Chasing another high until i end up meeting the man in the sky. Then i still fail. So why even try?

After an 11 year heroin habit I was put on methadone about a year ago and was on 120-150mg daily.. I also took about 60mg diazepam a day (and continued to use heroin) 

I entered treatment on the 14/04/2018 and I came out last week Friday so it was 12 weeks in the institution. This place was a gnarly low cost Christian place, they cold turkey’d me off methadone and heroin (fuck) and did a rapid 3 week taper for benzos. Words can’t describe the pain I felt. It was so bad I was passing out while standing, I got lockjaw, I shat myself at random and amongst other things I even would cum in my pants out of nowhere. My body was in fucking chaos. But about a month after that I was fine physically. Sometimes you just gotta take the pain man, I regret getting on methadone so fucking badly, detoxing off only heroin is so much easier than the combo. 

I thought I was a hopeless case, been using too long and too much, I thought full recovery was off the table for me, but I’m here now and feel somewhat normal. But as it’s known when the pain ends the real battles begins. 

Coming out of rehab I have moved back in with my parents which is quite depressing, all my money must be accounted for and there is a tracker on my phone. I have signed a legally binding contract which states I will be tested at random days 2 times a week and if positive for anything I will go back to live in the sober house for 2 years, this will go on for 6 more months. Kinda sucks cos I wish I could smoke weed(never given me any problems). 

Finally after so long I am free from the physical binding I had with heroin, it’s what I’ve always wanted, I never ever thought I could be 90 days clean. But now that I am, I have to be honest, I fucking miss it. I miss my old friends, the old spots, the missions, the scurry to get money, the appreciation of the dope when it was good and the disappointments of it being bad. I miss the thrill, and of course the effects. I was putting together a salad last night and the fucking smell of vinegar gave me such anxiety I thought I was going to vomit. I had to change a tire on my car and I found a rig and spoon and ear buds in a sun glasses case in the spare wheel. 

Basically, I’m fucking struggling. My recovery is motivated by fear and I’d rather die than be institutionalized for 2 years in that bible bashing fucking hell hole scrubbing walls, doing dishes and garden work all fucking day, so I won’t relapse. Not yet at least, but to be 100% honest, the only thing keeping me from sane is that in 6 months times I can, if I want, use heroin again. With a proper virgin tolerance as well.

There's no funny business, it's skied up face to face, since the first time I copped he's always blessed me with a extra point or 2 and even the one time I only had 200, he said he'd bless me and another generous g.

I wasn't aware just how similar the two compounds are;

Oxycodone's chemical name is derived from codeine. The chemical structures are very similar, differing only in that

Oxycodone has a hydroxy group at carbon-14 (codeine has just a hydrogen in its place)

Oxycodone has a 7,8-dihydro feature. Codeine has a double bond between those two carbons; and

Oxycodone has a carbonyl group (as in ketones) in place of the hydroxyl group of codeine.

I guess the short story is basically two of my coworkers were having an argument over something to do with work and completely out of nowehere dude brings up the fact that this girl USED TO do dope. He said to her face basically that he doesn't care what her opinion is because she used to ""shoot heroin into her arm and is addicted to drugs right now (suboxone that she is on)"".

This girl is over a year sober, has kids, doing pretty well it would appear to me. And I talk to her a lot and she has shared a lot of that side of her life with me being that I'm a user too. I mean im not too deep I guess but ive been around and ive seen enough of it to respect what she's done at least. 

But anyways, I said to dude that he should probably shut up because A. He has no idea what he's talking about and he sounds ignorant, and B. That hes gonna get fired if he keeps talking like that so at least keep his mouth shut for his own benefit. His response was more ignorant shit that I dont even want to talk about. 

I'm sorry to rant and post bullshit but that just really made me mad. Like where do you get off just tearing down another person like that? I swear nothing I said to this dude got through to him either. ",1531466638.0

(Also, mildly interesting chart inside)","On the Side: For fun, I've been keeping track of what I've been taking for a couple of months and I figure someone might find it interesting, and it also ties in to what I'm about to elaborate on. Here's a pic of the Excel sheet: https://imgur.com/a/gPzUiMQ

So I try to keep my opiate consumption down to weekends (may start early Thursday, usually nothing Sunday), or to weekday events like a show/event etc. I do this mainly to keep tolerance's low across the board so I can keep enjoying 5-10mg of hydrocodone (in a day), as well as any dose of pregabalin.

The thing is, I feel like I'm thinking/worrying about it too much, as I'd rather just enjoy the drugs instead of creating this idea in my head of how amazing it's going to be after a weeks+ wait. I say all this primarily because I did just that, waiting it out for a pretty good show (TBS, TSSF, C&C).

So I take a break for about 13 days, the day of the show comes, and I go through my ""Make the best of it"" ritual; 30mg DXM, 400mg Magnesium, 20mg Zinc, 600mg Agmatine. Wait 30 minutes, drink some WGFJ, wait a little, take a tums or two, pop 2 Percs (since it was a special event), and finish by drinking a bit more WGFJ. I get to the show an hour later, take a 300mg Pregabalin, and end up meeting some people and chillin with them for most of the show. After 3-4 hours, I never really felt the usual effects, given everything I did and the combo on top of it. This may have had something to do with a bit of anxiety hanging out with new people I just met (but I'm usually a social butterfly on anything, and I'd taken a 1mg clonazepam earlier that day), or the fact that I had half a gin and tonic (though I drank water the rest of the time). Towards the end, I pop another 300mg pregabalin, a 7.5mg hydro, and a .25mg alprazolam just because ""fuck it, I don't do these types of things enough, not feeling too great, and It's a Friday"".

The next morning, I felt like I'd literally wasted all those drugs. Yeah, I probably shouldn't have done the last couple of them, but regardless I felt like I got very little out of each drug when usually, I feel great doing any one of these on my own.

So this is my question. Should I be a bit more indulgent then keeping to waiting a week+? Do any of you have a similar style, and keep things fun doing stuff a bit more frequently? These are all pretty much replacements to drinking, and being stone cold sober for the week is screwing with my head. I have hobbies, and keep busy so It's not like I'm always thinking about getting high, but the idea of creating the perfect time is what I think is the problem. I'd love to pop something now since I'm winding down the week, but there's another event going on tomorrow so I'd rather just wait it out another day for the tolerance etc. (and that in turn just makes me more antsy about it all).

I know most of you are into harder things and this may all just sound like whining from someone doing amateur hour stuff, but It's just been on my mind for a while and I wanted to write it out and get some peoples thoughts on just lifestyle around doing your drugs in general. Thanks for reading.

P.S I've done harder stuff in the past back in college (oxy, dillies, opana on the daily etc.) and the fact that I'm even able to enjoy a 5mg hydro for a couple of hours these days is mainly why I've tried to keep to this regiment. Granted, I'd love to start upping my clonazepam (or anything I have) every now and then to enjoy the day a bit more, but I'm terrified of fucking up my tolerance, and I don't know how to space any of it out to keep it enjoyable/therapeutic.

They said you could prepare your heroin in 1 spoon and coke in another then draw up your dope and draw up a tiny drop of vegetable oil and then draw up your coke. This should keep the boy and girl separated in the rig with the girl below the boy so it hits you first. I imagine it would give you a crazy coke rush followed by boy to mellow it out. Would this be good though? In a speedball the rushes come together to make a perfect rush (like that movie the perfect storm except rushes). It sounds like a neat idea nevertheless. Like a roller coaster going way up then plunging down.

What do all of you think about this? I always mix my boy with girl anyway. I'm 1 of those addicts that would be so very disappointed to go try to get dope but not also get coke with it. Its like what's the point? I used to have drug dreams about trying to find boy for a super long time and then finally getting it only to wake up right before I do it. Now I dream I have boy but am on a lord of the rings scale journey to find girl to mix in so I can be satisfied. ",1531429765.0

I know I could just use foil but I kind of suck at that. For those that don't know, pinners are where you take about a matchead's size piece of black tar heroin (or can you do it with any other types? It doesn't seem like it would work bc it needs to be sticky to stick to your poker) and stick it to something pointy (I'll call it your poker I guess) like the end of an unfolded paperclip. Then you heat something up like a knife or I heat up a glass stick  I found in a head shop (one end has a little glass sphere at the end, the other is a thinner glass flat circle, both ends work for this method) with a butane torch until it's red hot and then you bring the heroin on your poker to the heated area of whatever other tool you chose to heat up as fast as possible moving it all around, back and forth, doesn't matter, just making sure to heat the heroin by putting it against the hot surface, while inhaling through a tooter (a straw, hollow tube, or broken pen (the hollow tube part) work fine), hold it in as long as possible, exhale and then enjoy the feeling... :)

Since I can get afghan heroin so much cheaper (it's like 1/5 the price of bth) do you have any ideas on how to make afghan heroin stick to the poker to make this all work or is there any way I could do something like add vinegar etc. to just change it to black tar heroin (bc I heard it's the acid in bth that makes it bth?)?

Just seems the slower, smoother music compliments the high better. However, one my of my favorite rappers, Earl Swearshirt, always fits perfect with some oxy’s.

I was against myself. The odds were irrelevant.","We lived together at Becky’s until she kicked him out for accidentally giving her 3-year-old daughter a burnt crack spoon to eat her Fruit Loops.  Not to mention his first week of living there, when he and I took Becky’s newest boy toy out on an all-night coke binge and left her with the kids at the house.  Doh-Doh missed a vein that night and got an abscess, which he drained a few days later with a knife that he bought at Walmart, after drinking a fifth of tequila.  Three of her kids watched him cut it open and squeeze the puss into the kitchen sink before he fell on his mattress in the living room.  He cried and punched the wall.

When she kicked him out I left, too.  We moved to the Hacienda Inn a few doors down from where I detoxed before.  We worked every day doing construction and shot up lots of cocaine every night in our room.  

On several occasions our own bad choices reduced us to eating packets of powdered creamer and sugar.  We licked the granules from our greasy palms and smacked our tongues to the roofs of our mouths, desperate for sustenance.  Doh-Doh had a good point when he said they tasted better together.  On the job site another worker got mad at me for eating a loaf of soggy bread he had left there a week before.  Our clothes were less like fabric and more like some strange moss that grew on our bodies always damp and cold.  When I smoked I tapped cigarette ashes onto my pants and rubbed them in.  

Doh-Doh did big shots of cocaine and stared at the curtains and held the syringe in his hand, cupping both of his ears.  Blood ran down his arms.  His dentures hung halfway out of his mouth.  There was no response to anything I said.  When I would hallucinate hearing the boots of the SWAT team running up the old iron stairs to bust us, I flushed our stash, and another time I keistered it and walked miles to Becky’s house at 3 a.m. to watch “Forrest Gump” until I came down.  Doh-Doh said it was a very rude thing to do.

I told you before that the owner of the Hacienda Inn wasn’t kind to me and Doh-Doh, and while that may be true, we were not innocent in our dealings with him.  For a month or more, we flushed syringe after syringe down the toilet, until it finally backed up.  Water leaked through the ceiling into the room below us, and the owner kicked us out the next day.  He tried to keep our stuff, but the disgruntled employees let us grab what we could.  It wasn’t like we had anything valuable.  

Carlos had just purchased a 1994 blue Chevy S10 for me with money my parents sent him.  We put the truck in my name, and Doh-Doh found me the next day.  It was around Thanksgiving, and our friends, a lesbian couple with a baby, let us stay at their place for the week while they visited family.  We did big shots of cocaine like always, and I almost burned the building down, afraid of the shadow people. 

Doh-Doh talked me into jumping through the neighbor’s window and borrowing the DVD player and flat screen without ever talking to the guy.  Doh-Doh said it was cool, because he had done a mutual friend’s taxes once.  I don’t think we ever watched a movie, but when the neighbor, his girlfriend and the landlord busted through the door, we had rags over our mouths and the room smelled like paint thinner.  I can’t remember what we said, but it’s hard to imagine our words were any consolation to the incensed trio.  The girl accused me of being a peeping tom.  It was not clear how she got that idea, but the stolen electronics in our possession and the solvent-soaked rag in my hand made me feel like I wasn’t credible.  I kept quiet.

8yba36,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8yba36/common_ropiates_misconceptions_thread/,67,https://redd.it/8yba36,diacetylhydroxymorph,Common r/opiates Misconceptions Thread,"There has been a lot of talk lately (and always) about cutting down on the frequently asked and easily googled questions here. In that spirit, I thought we could get a thread going to talk about some of the common misconceptions and incorrect information that comes up all the time in posts and comments here, and we could all share a little knowledge with one another.

For instance...

1. It’s not the naloxone in Suboxone that blocks opiates and causes PWD, it’s the buprenorphine. In the case of blocking, this partial agonist binds too tightly to the receptors to allow regular doses of opiates/opioids to saturate the already saturated receptors. On the flip side, the bupe has a higher affinity for the receptors, so when you injest bupe wen there is already a full agonist on your receptors, it “knocks off” the agonist and throws you into instant PWD. The amount of Naloxone is negligible (and poorly absorbed when taken orally or sublingually), so the Naloxone couldn’t be causing either of these effects anyway - hence why you can IV Suboxone.

2. Oral BA of Oxycodone is much higher than intranasal BA. While we are at it, the same goes for Alprazolam (and sublingual is even higher than oral, and peaks almost as quickly as intranasal dosing.)

3. Types of dope. No.3 Heroin is Heroin base, it is primarily found in Europe, it is not water soluble (must be broken down with an acid), and it is far more smokable than No.4. Fully refined No.4 Heroin (hcl) is primarily found in the eastern US - hence EastCoastPowder - and is easily soluble in water (please god, don’t heat it up), and smoking it is an awful waste (if you are going to do it at least add some caffeine to slow down the “burn.”) BlackTarHeroin is also No.4, but is not fully refined to powder form, and is water soluble (again, without heat. It is sometimes a pain in the ass to break down without heat, but you save precious product and you avoid dissolving any less soluble cuts) and easily  smoked. As an aside, saying “I have China White” nowadays is like saying “I have Orange Sunshine LSD.” 9/10 times it will be fent, and the chance of an average user or even a mid level dealer EVER seeing anything near 80% purity is slim to none.

4. Boiling your shots is a good way to lose product, not kill bacteria. The shot would have to be boiled for several minutes at a high temperature to kill anything, at which point your dope would be gone.

5. Cotton fever’s name refers to fever caused by injecting bacteria that was growing in your cotton and carries into your shot. But “cotton safety” isn’t a guarantee of prevention. There is some debate about the bacterial angle, but  VERY often it’s bacteria from your works, your spoon, your dope, or some foreign particle slipping into your solution and then into your blood stream. It can come from anywhere so sterilize EVERYTHING including your hands and your injection site. It sucks, and I wouldn’t wish it on (almost) anyone.

I've had an on-again-off-again habit for 8 years. I always end up relapsing in the summer when the busy season hits at work (pathetic maybe but, I can't seem to cope with working more than 45ish hours a week without drugs...)

I always loathed the thought of getting on methadone. I like to go on backpacking trips and similar adventures and didn't want to be tied down to a pharmacy. And I'm scared of methadone wds.

Now I'm thinking fuck it, better than being tied down to an unreliable dealer right? And I can't go on any adventures when all of my money is going to him.

My first question to y'all: Do you think it's worth it in my situation? My habit is small relative to many of you I'm sure -- about a quarter gram a day of potent stuff (probably laced with fent). For this relapse daily use began about 2 months ago. At that level, would it be easier to just tough out the wds do you guys think? 

Though another prob with cold turkeying it is obviously the fiending and cravings. Is methadone *actually* effective at eliminating (or significantly reducing) cravings?

These ones will probably vary between regions and possibly even between clinics, but any anecdotal answers are appreciated anyway:

Will I need to take a piss test on my first visit to the clinic? And do they watch you? (I get stage fright...just wondering so I can drink a bunch of coffee beforehand to help with that)

How long does it generally take between your first appointment and actually getting (and being able to use) your script?

The color of the coating was orange, and looks exactly like the shade it is supposed to be (I live in Europe). Put it in my mouth for a bit so I can peel it off and tastes exactly like it’s supposed to as well.

I’ve never seen unmarked pills and am a bit worried, maybe it’s nothing but I still want to ask for a second opinion. Let me know if you guys think they’re alright and if you’ve encountered these before.

Ive met men who were unrivaled in their wisdom and kindness; Extending help to any friend and foe. Never failing to genuinely want to understand a persons predicament. From that same man I learned that underneath that kind, joyful personality was the complete oppsite. A war vet, ruthless, borderline sadistic, wicked dark sense of humor. A trained killer in his youth, molded by a life of hardship and struggle.

 This old man, the same one that is always seen smiling and never failing to brighten others day with the light he straight the fuck up radiates, has a side dark enough to blot out the sun.
Now if you got chance to read the other shit i wrote you have an idea of how I write and talk; below casual, maybe even improper at times. But when I describe this man and tell his story, it is with the upmost reverance and respect. My words fail to do justice to the love and gratitude I have for this man.

Mr Dennis, I met him through work while I was a turbine technician. I was the youngest technician at 18, to work for this multimillion dollar company, at an gas turbine overhaul facility. Having a position created specifically to allow one as young as me to work. But I got that way because Mr Dennis took me under his wing, he never failed to teach me multiple ways to do things, and explaining why not just the how. (This honestly made me love teaching and helping others, if they are willing to learn. ) 
This was not exclusive to just work though, I always had traits of a sociopath, such as feeling little or no emotions such as guilt, regret, or empathy. I dont laugh much or  joke, My demeanor is always serious, my voice never changing tones, But with Mr Dennis, I would laugh and smile, with my own attempts of humor after realizing we share that much. I felt a bond form I never had come close to forming with any human being. I learned we're alot more alike than I thought. Like tf, how could such a good person be anything like me? 

I was always receptive to anything Mr Dennis would teach me, telling learning different shit is never a bad thing. Another thing I embedded into the way I think. A year or so went by, and we grew close, never having grandparents, I called him my gramps. He had no say in the matter. He was thrown off by the change in character, cos i rarely show affection or any sort of admiration to any coworkers, but to me thats the last thing he was.

I excelled in my field, At 20, I understood and could balance rotating masses, assemble each and every variant of turbine we worked on enough so to begin writing procedures. I truly blossomed , having used my full potential for once in my life. But I never stopped learning as long as he didnt stop teaching. Every lesson I instilled in every ounce of my being, to show that the same time and effort he put in, id return ten fold. 

With this he knew I would be susceptible to, as he puts it "" Gettin too big for your britches"" not wanting me to "" get caught with your pants down and Johnson floppin"" In other words, to be humble. To know there is always someone better always one who knows more than you. Ill be damned, because I was just bout to have my Johnson flop out. I did get cocky, In my eyes I did earn it, and no longer needed help from other technicians, but since Gramps said , "" theres no harm in hearing something you already know, who knows it might be the same lesson with a new perspective kiddo"" 
That shit blew my mind. I was like fuck u right gramps. I learned to be understanding, or try to, for the sole purpose of a new perspective. Never realising that its akin to,  two people viewing the same mountain, from different angles. Its essentially the same mountain, and one man sees a path the other would never have known existed.

I absolutely love the sense of community on this sub.  Anyways, I’m a pain patient that has been getting prescribed 100 norcos (10/325) per month for the past 6 years and then purchases more of the same medication elsewhere when that script runs out mid month. I know Hydrocodone is weak in comparison to many of the ops I see here but I love it and am grateful for what I get (especially these days).  I’m ashamed to admit that during these last 6 years, I have always just eaten every pill as is and never bothered to remove the Tylenol. I understand that it’s horrible for my liver, and while I never ingest more than 4 grams of APAP a day and yearly physicals have shown normal liver function, you fine people have encouraged me to take the time to do CWEs. While I fully understand how to actually do the extraction, good ol’ Google couldn’t answer the following questions for me: How long is the filtered solution good for after the extraction is complete? For example, if I do a CWE on 20 pills tonight, will my solution be good all day tomorrow? If so, should I refrigerate it or keep it at room temperature? Also, would you say that the Hydrocodone is evenly dispersed throughout the liquid? For example, would drinking half of my solution be equivalent to 100 mgs or is it impossible to know how much active medicine is in a poured dose?

I was mistaken.,"Well you guys were right. Certainly I was totally depressed, Moody, and feeling like crying on my birthday when I finally felt bad enough for myself to fly a sign and pan handle $10. The moment I made that petty amount of cash, I dragged my sick ass self across the metro lines and boarded two trains to some project buildings in NY that will remain unnamed. 

Well, I copped a single bag, spun around, and came back the way I came. The whole time I was thinking to myself ""at least my day can't get any worse."" That's when I noticed the two cops that had jumped out of their suv about a hundred feet ahead of me as they doubled back to my location. ""Someone's about to get fucked, lol."" I thought as I chuckled to myself. ""Hey buddy, just going for a quick one minute sprint through some of the most dangerous projects in the city?"" Well fuck. That someone is me.

""N-no, it's my birthday and-""

I didn't even know where I was going with this. The cops already had me cuffed and were already going through my back pockets. My single pathetic bday bag was in my front jeans pocket. Seriously they must have been watching me the entire minute I was there because they found it in <30 seconds. 

Needless to say, I went to jail and was booked on a misdemeanor possession of heroin. I was released at which point I, while  sick as fuck, took the half of a suboxone they found but neglected to discard or charge me with.

She really wanted me to go. It would be a good place to bum cigarettes. Besides, getting out of the house was nice, and I liked talking to the other addicts. Alcoholics were nice too but seemed antiquated and out of touch with the chemical realities facing meth, heroin and cocaine addicts. Meetings are meetings, and they said the same things there that they say across the country. It works if you work it. One day at a time. Just let go and let God. One man stood up and said something like,

“I know that I judge myself worse than anyone else. Do you guys know what I’m saying? We are always our own worst critics.” That was false. He’d obviously never heard me criticize another human being.

A small blond girl with a crooked face stamped onto the bottom of pale and lumpy head smiled at me. She followed me to and around every meeting I attended and maintained a certain air of morbidity when we talked. I liked another girl though, a black-eyed Apache princess, who had a soft spot for green eyes like mine. Her name was Gabriella.

Gabriella took me home on a Wednesday night after a meeting. We sat on her couch. We locked eyes. We kissed, and in the morning, she walked around the living room on thoroughbred thighs and cooked breakfast. Her eyes opened wide when we talked. She told me that she liked everything I liked. We were the same person, soul mates, and fate had brought us together. I told her stupid things. I told her I wanted to be a writer. I told her that I loved her. She took me to the store and bought me a Smith-Corona Coronet 12 Electric Typewriter because she loved me too.

Gabriella took me back to my aunt’s house to pick up my stuff, which was nothing but a toothbrush and a few pairs of boxers. I let my aunt know that I was moving into Gabriella’s house. She asked me not to. I told her it was better for her and Steve. She said I needed stability. I told her Gabriella would provide it. She thought it was a terrible idea, and she was right.

Gabriella was sobbing at the door when we got back. Black eyeliner tears ran down her face. She fumbled in her bag for the key. I quietly clutched my toothbrush and boxers because it was obvious something serious had just changed. Inside, she walked directly back to the bedroom and flung herself on the bed. I sat behind her and kept calm. She cried until I fell asleep. She got up to start cooking a pot of meatballs at four in the morning, and when I woke up, I found an untouched bottle of lithium, a month’s supply, in the bathroom with her name on it. It was eight months old.

Things disintegrated after that. We talked about her taking her meds, and she always promised to start. She never did.She was supposed to start seeing a therapist. She never did. I worked three days a week at a local Vietnamese restaurant. When I came home, she’d either jump into my arms and kiss me and tell me she missed me so much or she would be in bed crying or cleaning the house with chemicals and cooking large vats of food neither of us ever ate or sometimes she broke glass figurines and cups at my feet for no reason. However perfect we were together and in love and happy during her manic upswings was equally how disgusting and emotionally abusive I was and miserable she was when depression came on and things plummeted. I never knew what I was going to get.

We went to meetings. There were signs that she had started using again and was lying about it. I hoped for the best. I tried with all I had to believe she was still sober, but at a meeting one night, she began opening a bag of Sour Patch kids during the preamble and still hadn’t opened it when the meeting ended. She kept dropping it and getting stuck when she leaned over to pick it up.

I had unintentionally acquired a white-haired sponsor named Dave. He was an ex-firefighter. Dave came to visit me where I worked, when it was slow. He offered a lot of advice. He liked to share his opinions, and one of my last days at the restaurant, one of the last days of sobriety and pretending life was actually going to work out for me, he asked,

“So, Clyde, did you ever talk to your boss about what I said? I really think the place would feel more authentic if he had an Asian girl working the front instead of you.”

“I told him, and he said he didn’t care what you thought. I think that’s about as authentic as it gets.” I laughed. He laughed, and in one second, I went from liking Dave to hating him. Something about his white hair and being retired from firefighting grossed me out and pissed me off, and I knew that our friendship was over. I hated him for being an alcoholic. He was divorced from an ex-wife who hated him. Now I hated him the same way she did.

Back at the house with Gabriella, I hid from her. On a Friday morning before I left, she admitted to using heroin and benzos. We made an agreement that she would stop the next morning after enjoying one last day with the drugs. When I got home from work she was sleeping it off, and I went to the back room to sit at the typewriter. The stress of everything with her and Dave and not shooting up anymore or being violent stifled me. It didn’t seem like it could work. As I sat with my hands and fingers poised over the keys, I imagined a large and ever expanding latex balloon inside of me. It held all my heartbreak, my love, my hatred, my violent proclivities, my weaknesses, my memories, my creative potential, my failures and marred images of myself. These things mixed to create caustic gasses and pressure in the balloon. I knew it needed to be let off, and I knew that this thing inside of me would explode and kill me and everything around me if I didn’t. I knew writing was the outlet. I just didn’t know how to open the valve. Before I went to sleep, I banged out the only words I ever wrote on that typewriter.

“Write it, Clyde. It will kill you if you don’t. This is your only chance. It’s over after this. You’ve got to get it out.

Sincerely,

Clyde.”

Before my eyes opened it had already begun. Gabriella chucked the typewriter through the bedroom window to wake me up. It was freezing outside. She was screaming. There was black blood running down her wrists and arms flinging droplets from her fingers as she wailed and foamed at the mouth. There was no way I would be able to focus on her keeping her promise to get sober that morning, while she was breaking down like that. It took an hour to disarm the situation. I bandaged her arms. I pulled the hundred-dollar bill from my wallet, laid it on the kitchen table and asked her,

“What can you get for this?”",1531340070.0

I’ve had a solid 6 years using, followed up by being sober three years. I was heavy into oxy, like 3-500 mg daily at my worst.  On my 1096th day sober (3 years exactly) I treated myself to 60mg and was absolutely floored... overdid it a little prolly but I didn’t vomit so I couldn’t care less. Anyways fast forward 3 months and I’m currently shooting 1-2g of some of the finest ecp the Midwest has to offer.  Things started falling apart, as my girlfriend and I live and use together.  Basically I’m paying for two drug habits at once because I love my girlfriend, but her disease had progressed far beyond mine before we met, and it gets to life and death with her.. narcaned her twice in the past month. Deep down I know that she understands the consequences of what will happen if we continue to use, but cannot testify for her (or any addict) that she will hold the value of our relationship above all else.. lol.  So here’s the deal: been on vacation for the past week, flew cross country to an island without any fucking dope, (dopesick in airport security? fucking sucks) actually forgot I had a loaded 9mm clip in my backpack and got held up for a bit lmfao but got thru security none the less. did a sub taper from 8-1mg and staying at 1mg daily.. we’re going to be home by this time tomorrow and despite feeling back to normal, I can’t resist the temptation of picking up for one more night... since we would both prolly end up using, the chances of a single use turning full on relapse are greater.  I just want to hear what it’s like from y’all experience in these situations.. typically my first use after a break is overwhelming and I won’t wanna do it again the next day.. but I’m worried my tolerance won’t be as low as it was “those other times” and that I’ll slip right back into oblivion..also heroin.  

Will post dope porn if I follow through.. probably won’t post sub porn if I don’t.

TLDR:  Clean for a week, really want to get a few hits for my first night back.  How hot is the fire I’m playing with?",1531339724.0

In all the years I've smoked weed and done other recreational drugs(heroin, fent, carfent) and nothing even close to this has ever happened. Shit, of the 7 years I was doing HEROIN, I haven't ever overdosed or had ajy scares. But this... Some 'friends' showed up to smoke a blunt & chill, whatever. So after we smoke, I get out of the car to say my goodbyes & whatever, right? I make it about 7, 8, maybe 9 complete steps before I completely lose my head. Like, it feels like my head detatches from my body. I fall face first into the ground, kapow. My head tries to come back for a minute, I sit up, rub my head and tell these people to help me to my apartment. They set me against the corner of the building, where I immediately lose my head again. It was the strangest feeling, like getting lightheaded, but everything just floated away. I cannot explain the feeling exactly... In short, they just sat me down there, essentially overdosed(this blunt must have been laced, had to be! Right?) and was about to just leave me. Thank GOD that my dude Gwee was outside on the phone, he was the first one really there. Then Bleu, she said she had a gut feeling to go out & get some fresh air & saw our neighbor down there, so she runs on out. Then comes Link  followed by Tweety and they all bring me inside. I was blue, white, whatever- pissed myself, talking nonsense and just completely out of it. All I remember is coming to sitting on the toilet, holding my head. But I came back and I'm fine. Moral of the story is, don't smoke blunts with strangers.

Then the media would talk about how all the “insulin addicts” are a victim of this evil drug insulin, that has the power to turn people into homeless prostitutes, and that there is an “insulin epidemic” and that all the “insulin addicts” need “treatment” for their “insulin use disorder”, “for their own good” of course.

They would further blame the insulin itself, not the prohibition of insulin, for all the problems caused by the prohibition of insulin, which would lead to an even harder crackdown on insulin, which would make things even worse, so they would crackdown on insulin even harder, and things would get even worse, so they’d crackdown on insulin again even harder, and things would continue to get worse and worse.

And this cycle would continue and continue and continue, all because the effects of the prohibition of insulin are being blamed on insulin itself.

This is EXACTLY what has happened with opiates.

When opiates were completely legal and over the counter like insulin - which they were for thousands of years since the beginning of time up until March 1, 1915 when the 1914 Harrison Narcotics Act went into effect - people who took opiates lived completely normal lives just like people who take insulin today.

It is time to end the prohibition of opiates and restore our right as individuals to choose our own medicine.

Ive been writing down daily about my experiences documenting both high and low, and posted key events as a way to vent. Although private, I wanted to share my troubles in hopes thatll itll help others in their own troubles.

This is a continuation from where I left off. 

This isnt a story with characters based on true events, or one bigger than life tale where the main character does all sorts of cool shit  bendin the fuckin heavens. These are real experiences that brought a whole lot of real pain, misery, and sorrows. Im not a scholar, but Im not completely stupid. Im a 22 year old, who made the wrong choices, pushin weight, and puttin love and trust in the wrong people.  Ive lost my home, expensive cars, a lot of family and friends. All because two people tried to be together even when it felt like the world, like shit even the universe, did everything in its power to stop it. This aint a tale bagging on a woman who ""wronged"" me or meant to make yall feel resentment towards any one that has. I ask that you try to be understanding because no one is perfect, were all human, we fuck up , we do bad shit , we love, we hurt. 

Sry if im ramblin I just want it to be known, there aint no hero, no villians, just regular people experiencing life and all its challenges

Im sitting there more upset about losing the only two things ive had strong emotions for.  Im in the back of the car just feelin a mix of emotions like anger, neglect, and just straight up hurting. The ride to the first holdin cell went by fast, and once I laid down it started. All these negative thoughts eating at me, like what is she doin? Who is she with? Why arent I good enough to be with ? Why cant she want me like she does the drugs? 

Just a bunch of shit like that, it was torment man but in retrospect; feeling all those emotions and thoughts with no drugs to supress them, made me deal with them head on. I felt it, I couldn't ignore it any more. At the time It honestly felt like it was tearing at my spirit, but I know now it was just strengthening it.

I eventually fall asleep, and get awoken by some dude with a tiny penis and herded onto a bus to go downtown. Honestly nothing interesting happens i just go to county , get a PR bond and get out.  But the like 2 days in there just let me think and this moment was a key moment because I began to detach myself from her. I pretty much was in denial about our relationship, I couldnt accept it falling apart until I was forced to reflect.  Even though my life was slowly falling apart , at the time I felt there is no life without her. I made one person my reason for purpose and being.   

  ( There aint nothin wrong with love, but once your life is dependant on another you done fucked up. Experience yalls lives together. Itll save u some ache)

I get released at like 3am, straight up looking like a vato. No cash no phone nothing. I bum a cigg and start walkin, kind of mindless and this dude comes up to me showing me his knife. Im already in the worst of moods and tell this dude i dont want to buy his knife and just push him aside.  I didnt know he was trying to rob me till later and i felt really bad because of how rude i was. 

What carried on the next few months was basically like we were bleeding out. She actually found my dog and returned him and ill forever be grateful. But id message her always hoping for a reply and when i would get one, itd be short. It hurt. So bad. On top of having to go to probation and out patient rehab 2x a week it crushed me slowly. She had already been seeing other people, and entertaining( if you can call it that) me occasionally.  Ima leave it at that.

My father let me move in to get on my feet. I never thought a person could constantly think about someone every hour of the day. Wondering if shes okay, if shes thinking of me when songs we listened to came on, or if when a beatle drove by, shed fight the instict to turn and punch me. I picked up drinking because of drug tests, and sleeping pills/ prescription meds. My schedule before i got a job would be to wake up popp some meds to pass back out. Repeat. I couldnt physically or mentally do it. When i got a job, i was on autopilot. 

I dont remember much of the months after, I wasnt really living, just existing. I wouldn't talk to any females or barely hang with friends.  Except one, now im hesitating to even mention her or our relationship but she was a good friend.

A 

Strictly platonic, shed send me pictures tagg me in shit, like any one of my brothers would. To be honest im really bad at flirting or knowing when to pick up on social cues ( ex. Guy tryna rob me) 
I enjoyed her company, but B was always on my mind and my heart never stopped loving her. 

( oh btw my ex was in jail for 4 months n i didnt know. Id send her messages every now and then telling her i loved her andhope shes okay) 

I grew close to A, but i was kinda a mess and was in no position to even get into a relationship. I realized the moment A and I are driving just gettin chickfila. I did something selfish, I held her hand. But I never onced looked over, cos in my mind, for a split second, i had my partner in crime, my best friend, my angel kitty, right back by my side. 

I wouldnt really show much affection after that. I couldnt use her as a replacement. She meant alot to me and helped me deal with each day a bit better. The feelings did grow but I never asked her to be more than friends. We were essentially a couple but i was just to scared shitless to start again.  

Around January of this year, we were doin what we usually do chillin, killin, bein villians n my homie invites us to her crib. Now at this point probation has me pretty much clean. I would just take adderall. I was given more freedom and would only have to come to probation 1x a week giving me thursdays go fuck off wifh A. So i ask slam to get us "" w h i t e "" because i haven't shot up anything in a while and didnt really have an urger to dl anything else. Quick high and A could snort ( didnt like me shooting too) i arrive at slams and i pay her 20 and she hands me a bag of white powder. I thought shit this is ""skimpy but fuck it""  i make a shot put as much as I normally do for a shot of C O K E. So the second i shoot it up i dont hear no bells no sound nothing i just get warm and im like ""T h i s i s n t c o-""  and i really dont understand whats going on im just not cognitive. Im like wtf is happening lol. And trying to come to but i cant. I cant see or interact with thd world around me and i just feel my face vibrating. I eventually come to and im like"" slam i meant coke my b""  n theyre lookin at me like im crazy cos A is slapping me trying to keep me from noddin cos i wasnt respondin and just am okay the next few minutes. 

So i shouldve been careful and told A it fr fr wasnt coke but i forgot. Were chillin im nodding hardcore like i sit in couch and hug A being like a pet. She asks for a line I pull out the bag of coke and tell her hurry. Being in my state of mind I didnt even realize what I did.

She comes back normal, and I just lift her arm up to hug me n shit. But i notice she isnt doing it as hard as she was. I was like ""k"" and kept readjusting her arm for her. I get frustrated and finally look up bout to literally throw a fit and deck this bitch. Jk but i look up and its like pulp fiction.

The look in her face is one im very familiar with. Im looking up and her green eyes are focused on me, and my probably over exagerrated expression. It felt like we were starin at each other like retards for a good minute, but the instant her eyes lost focus, I felt mine widen up and my jaw slightly drop kinda like when youre bout to say
 "" o h sh i t n o ""   

I felt my blood rush, and my mind snap back to reality, like straight up on an instinctual level. I was fuckin nodded like Icouldn't move not even 30 seconds ago, like legit paralyzed. But the seriousness of the situation triggered an adrenaline rush or some shit.  Without a thought ,i went from having my head on her lap with her arm over me, to moving my arm around her back to support her as she became jelly and sliding my feet off the couch for better support n shit.  

So like this literally happened in a 10 second time frame. Like my friend hasnt noticed what even was beginning to happen. She was barely speaking or breathing and each second that passed  just increased my anxiety. Because each second brought me closer to the realization that she wasnt going to make it.

I was panicking internally, trying to plan what to do, where the nearezt hospital was, where my keys are , how many compressions for CPR , how many breaths.  My mind was all fucked, man the life was fading from her and I tried everything to grab on to just a lil bit of it.
I was dead ass crying fr fr. I picked her up, as slam opened the door , and car door.  All i could fuckin say was 
"" please dont leave me too.""

I've always known the good stuff is around but hard to find since its not the national DOCs of ice and K. I'm not a fan of either. 

The last few months have been hard and I've increasingly craved the sweet release of a fat shot. So going through a heavy bout of depression I drive by this seedy 'under the bridge' Park area that has always stuck out to me. Shady guys walking around obviously doing something they aren't supposed to. Went back to American assumptions and thought ""ah, these are definitely junkies or tweakers or something of the sort. I'll go check it out."" 

Being non-asian I immediately get attention of everyone I cross paths with. ""Not so weird,"" I think, as I'm used to stares being a foreigner. So I just walk around trying to think of the right slang to use in Chinese etc. I get to an elevated path leading to a dark isolated pavilion. I pass a dude that I almost ask but instead just say hello. I get to the pavilion and start rethinking all this. Then I turn around to see dude I just said hi to heading my way. Oh he's getting close. What should I say...hmm...ok, he's standing very close to me..weird. ""How's it going?"" I say....BAM aaaaand he's grabbing my dick and trying to kiss me. I jump back nearly over the railing in terror. ""Whoa guy, I'm not gay."" He starts apologizing. Then asks wtf am I doing here in the gay hookup area. Ohhhhhhh. I tell him why and he schools me on the fact that this isn't the west. There are no places you can just go score at here. You have to know someone who knows someone etc. Says he knows nobody who's into the good stuff but lots of gays like to get tweaked out or do some k before doing the nasty and offers to take me around to ask the other gay guys. Kind offer but no thanks. Back to my boring Suboxone plus zanies.

So of course I have heard about kratom and it's benefits at least as far was withdrawing is concerned.

If so, is there a certain type I need to for this purpose?

So most of you are aware of all the fent in a lot of various continents, which has in a lot of them nearly or fully replaced the actual heroin they had prior. And a smaller but still pretty big amount of you know it's fent that is being made in meth lab style operations in the jungles on south american countries, as well as china, which irdk how they do it, and wouldn't surprise me if they were able to use actual lab equipment (sort of like how on breaking bad they first did their cooks pretty ghetto-ly, in an old RV, and latter on got a physical location with all the equipment that a pharmaceutical company would have/use), either in a static lab spot like I mentioned in parenthesis that the main characters of BB got to utilize, or potentially the same type of jungle style clandestine operations done by imo the majority of illicit manufacturers of these types of drugs. Hell I've even heard of those producing MDMA in the netherlands are creating environmental hazards by dumping their hazardous waste products from their 'cook's', and littering as well, in the forests of the area, tho all i kept thinking while watching the vid/show/i forget what it was on... like: ""jesus fuck if your govt. just legalized that already, this shit'd stop nearly overnight!""

Ugh, I'm sorry for the tangent, I'm tryna do better, and ik you've prob heard me say that a trillion times only for me to go back on my word, but I really am, its just hard for me.

**MAIN POST**
==========
Anyway, so I was reading various random wikipedia articles, as I often do for hours straight when stimmed, and even just sober too lol. So I was curious as to what class of drugs dextromethorphan belonged to, since I had seen somewhere the name of a drug called Levomethorphan or something like that, and it said it was an opioid or opiate, i forget too. So I google it, and find a wiki page that is helping clear up my inquiries. The article that had sparked this idea is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphinan). 

Specifically this quote from it: ""Of the major naturally occurring opiates of the morphinan type—morphine, codeine and thebaine—thebaine has no therapeutic properties (it causes seizures in mammals), but it provides a low-cost feedstock for the industrial production of at least four semi-synthetic opiate agonists, including hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone and oxymorphone, and, perhaps more significantly, the opioid antagonist naloxone."" 

Lastly, this quote...: ""The substitution of certain bulky groups on nitrogen 17 converts an opioid agonist into an opioid antagonist, the most important of which is naloxone, a non-selective opioid antagonist with no opioid agonist properties whatsoever. Additionally, substitution of certain very bulky groups on carbon 6 converts naloxone into a peripherally-selective opioid antagonist with no centrally-selective antagonist properties (naloxegol).""

Now idk how difficult it'd be to clandestinely produce naloxone, and even if possible, idk if it'd be possible to somehow make it either like not potent enough so it's not strong enough to push out the opioids from the ODing individual's receptors... or like too potent, where at the least, the tiniest bit brings them back, but in violent PWDs, or somehow could have some worse effects? Irdk just guessing. Mainly due to the greedy af pharma companies trying to think ""Hey look a crisis, lets try and exploit it since nobody can just not use the stuff, since even if they don't use, its more than likely someone they're closed to does, or used to and incase they lapse or relapse, narcan's there... and imo it's always better to have something that goes unused, vs. needing something that's not there. 

**So yeah, what'd'you guy's think?** I'd love to hear from the more chemistry/science oriented members the best obv., but in general... if possible, and hopefully not requiring expensive and/or closely-monitored precursors, and/or expensive lab equipment mixed with a good working knowledge of drug synths, and chemistry... we could be making our own narcan to give to friends and ppl we see outside who look as if it might save their life later today with how high they seem. 

I also thought that IF its possible, however requires most if not all of the criteria I hoped that it wouldn't, than perhaps the clandestine chemists making fent and it's analogs can make a bunch of narcan to ship with it, so their dealers under them, and so on, and so forth, can make it safer for themselves when selling fent or fent cut dope, as they're making sure they got narcan, which imo could mitigate the risk of at least a fatal OD, which could easily get the dboy, unjustly AF I might add (but i'm not gonna rant about it like I did b4 in over 10,000 chars, which ik since that's the post limit here lmao), a fucking murder charge! 

I've already deleted more than 7 long tangential off-topic paragraphs from this post, and am ending this here and now, tho it still seems pretty long needlessly... at least i figure it's not way too long or unpostably long lol.

Wish me luck.,"Like it says, nothing special. You all know how it goes. Finally had a good thing going for about 8 months. Got off whatever pills I could get a hold of and used kratom. It was great. Bought it online for cheap. it helped me out so much. Took away cravings, gave me some motivation and energy at work. It was still something I had to take everyday to not feel sick, but I'm ok with that for now, it was my mantainence. 

But of course I found a fake Roxie connect thru a guy I worked with. Then once a week turned into everyday after a month or two. It's been about 4 months with this run. I've fucked myself financially more than I'd like to admit. I'm sure you all can imagine, late on car payment, bills a month behind, scrambling for rent. The whole nine yards. This a just a quck rundown as I think a few of you have probably been on the path I am on at some point. It sucks, but it's my own fault. 

Luckily I've been tapering down basically because money is so tight. So I have that going for me. Don't have much in the way of comfort meds due to money right now unfortunately. I have some lope, bud, and a quarter of a sub,  Roughly 2mg. No days off, but working some half days compared to my usual 12+hr days. It's gonna suck, but I just accepted a new job offer. I start in 2 weeks, so I want to be clean and ready. I think it will be good for me. I'm still working my current job till then. So I figure if I'm gonna have to be a sick zombie at work, might at we'll be seeing my last 2 weeks when it doesn't matter what I do.

first off, no real cravings so that wasnt a problem. woke up after not doing tar that night and got what i call the ""hot-colds"", where your body overheats and you get all sweaty so then you cool off and now your cold as fuck.

also i had the strong desire to do nothing but lay in bed and watch shit on tv/my phone. anxiety at this time was very high to the point where i felt it in my chest, along with fucking RESTLESS ass legs almost as bad as when i tripped off hella benadryl in 8th grade...

welp, its been 5 or 6 days and ive had kratom and phenibut for 3, and i still have the hot colds and restless legs but no anxiety, still no cravings. just been smokin weed, chillin, doin me.

and god damn i was smacked off pheni and hit up hella bitches to fuck and i probably done busted bout 4 nuts in one day, i was so damn horny i even got me morning wood back again.

If I did, I'd have two options. Derrick or Tim. Derrick skims from the top, and Tim has a family and I'm pretty sure he's struggling to stay clean. My proposing that we pick up product would be enough to push him to break his sobriety if he hasn't already. Even if he did break his sobriety, I wouldn't judge him.. I should call him tomorrow just to catch up with him and remind him how well subs work for me.

A while back I was speaking to Tim about being on subs and he said that hearing such reassured him, made him feel better about staying the course. We both deviated back into dope not long after and thus I obviously did not follow through. Still, I was on subs for two weeks to that point and living proof that I was physically fine.

&nbsp;

Briefly, I owe Derrick $10 but I've chosen to make him wait. Why not? He inconvenienced me with the spice that was *not* of Jewish origin. Even when he paid me back he was short a single bag and 3/4 bags were skimpy. I could just indefinitely avoid giving him the $10 he thinks I owe him but frankly if giving him $10 prevents him from inquiring about it, or blabbing off about me owing him $10 to his family then it's money somewhat well spent.

How exactly did I come into owing him $10? One night I wanted to spend $20 on dope, and didn't feel like going to the ATM to get another $10 that night. I insisted on getting $20 worth and he insisted that I could take my time owing him $10 more, so he inevitably provided me with a $30 half. Now he has been waiting, he should've listened to me. I don't need to build good will with him though because I don't plan on doing anymore business with him. Therefore I haven't had a reason to rush. 

&nbsp;

Back to my buddy Tim; he's the only person I'd ever buy dope through going forward but I don't plan on buying dope anymore. Something just clicked last time I finished a batch of dope. I know what it would feel like and for some odd reason I'm able to think rationally about how it would be a waste of money. Granted having subs are a major factor, but then I think. 

Would I buy dope if I had ran out of subs and couldn't get more subs right away?

I don't know, but I do know that whenever I reach the bottom of the barrel with subs, I preempt the potential discomfort by bringing myself to the lowest bearable dose which has the effect of up to doubling the mount of days I have left. Surely going to a doctor would be simpler. I've actively chosen not to do that at this time. 

&nbsp;

Can I do dope tomorrow? Sure. The instant my direct deposit arrives I can reach out to a douch nozzle and have product within 1-6 hours or I can reach out to Tim, stick my bike in his car at 9pm and pick up the junk within the 15 minutes it takes him to drive to the 'hood. Along the way we'd tell stories, exchange laughs, and discuss ""close calls"" with family. From there he would drop me off at a service road that lines up with my homeward bound destination, we'd wish each other well, possible use the ""L"" word and part ways. Well perhaps he'd wait an extra minute while I attach the wheels to my bike, wouldn't want me to get mugged for being ill prepared to take flight.

err...**trigger warning**..
Then I would go home, get to my formica desk, pour out two to three bags, chop the ECP up with a card, make it into a series of smaller lines (optimal nasal interface!) and then line up the strizzle, taking care to bring it to the back of my nose -- wouldn't want those nose hairs stealing my dope! Then finally, a series of sniffs, not too hard.. we don't wanna cough up our ECP and then finally sit back -- and do the very same thing I'd be doing if I didn't have the dope.

So you know, why bother? After a day or two of this I would either buy a little more or run out. At which point I would wake up feeling moderate to bleh and would resume my Suboxone consumption except at a higher dose than what I was taking the day before I bought dope.

**Note for active users: Don't forget about the U shaped straw apparatus to promote lung health!**

&nbsp;

Tomorrow I'll only see Dbag, he who giveth spice bags. I'll give him the ten dollars he believes I owe him despite my more logical perceptions, though I might be a little biased. Maybe he'll ask me if I want dope, maybe he'll even say ""I already have it on hand, no need to wait"" (for once). Fuck that shit. Steady as I go, I really want to stay the course. The subs keep me from getting sick despite my recent past decisions to do dope which inevitably causes me to feel sick.

&nbsp;

I already know what I need and want:

- More weed, the last harvest was a bit dry.. kinda ran out of nutrients early. Regardless, all weed I have or have access to is good for the soul.

- Things for my turtles. I'm thinking about building them bunk beds so they'll have more room for activities!

- Bike parts. I lost my rear mudflap when I bought dope with Tim. I need a new one otherwise I'll continue to get a rooster tail of mud on my back when I bike in the rain.

If you look at my post from a month ago, I went on a trip with my friends after a 24 day break from opiates. I had no clue it was 24 days. I thought it was like 2 weeks. 

The first night of the trip, I took 120mg of oxy over the span of like 2 hours, so I thought my tolerance didnt drop I just got a good high. Boy was I wrong. 

The second night I took 120mg at once, I was at dinner with my family and I started getting so fucking high, the nausea overcame me and I couldnt keep my eyes open. I ran to the bathroom and puked my guts out hoping i’d feel better. I stayed in the bathroom puking for like 10 minutes, then made my way back to the dinner table. 

I was still high as fuck, trying my hardest to look normal, but I kept nodding out & started to feel nauseous again & started sweating. I told everyone I didnt feel good and had my homies take me back to my room. I was barely able to walk straight, they said I was pale as fuck. I threw up in my bathroom, and passed out on my bed. My friends were making sure I was breathing and stayed in the room with me. Then I blacked out. 

I have no recollection of the rest of that night- the rest is shit my friends told me. I guess throughout the night I would wake up, and just do some dumb shit. It was like I was blacked out drunk. Sounding delirious, doing some stupid ass shit. I guess I would wake up, jump out of bed, do some weird shit and go right back to bed. For example, I was trying to recreate the thing from Saints Row 3 where you jump in the car window. 😂 and was doing some “hammerhead dance”. I would wake up and say some random shit, for example I woke up from sound sleep and said “He wants $500 but you can talk him down to $250” no one knew what I was talking about. 

I woke up the next morning, with a shitload of nausea, and a pounding headache. My friends were suprised I made it through the night, but they were helping the shit out of me. They were making sure I was sleeping on my side incase I threw up, put a cold towel on my head, etc. 

Did I OD? I wish I realized how long my break was, I wouldve prevented this. my tolerance was dropped, the next night I took 70mg and was high as fuck. ",1531272771.0

When my family found out they gave me two choices, get help or get out. I chose to get out. I left home with a backpack, a few tee shirts and 50 dollars. I was worried they would try to find me if I stayed gone, so I spent most of the money on a bus ticket down the coast, and of course a bag of dope. In high school I was a cheerleader and an honor roll student, even while getting high, but moving to the new city let me reinvent myself with no shame. I slept in parks and panhandled. 

“Mr Fantastic’ found me dope sick in a park. He offered me a front, and I made the mistake of getting into his car, a brand new Mercedes. He started driving to “get the dope.” Once we got on the interstate I realized something was wrong. He passed me a gram of tar. I was so terrified that I decided to just tune everything out. I got high as a kite and fell asleep. He took me to a motel room, ironically in the city I originally came from. He kept me trapped in a motel room, kept me incredibly high, beat the shit out of me, raped me, and found wealthy white businessmen online to sleep with me at high end hotels for large amounts of money. He even advertised that I was 16 on certain sites. I grew up sheltered in an upper middle class neighborhood, and I went to private school. The fact that all these men, men who reminded me of my friends parents, were paying to sleep with a strung out, pimped out, teenager shocked me.

Typically he would book a few rooms in a four star hotel, and a few suites in some shit box hotel for us to live in. There were five of us working girls, him, and and an older girl who didn’t work anymore but helped him manage us and sell drugs. He had everything from cocaine to crack to ecstasy to heroin to 30s to Xanax to weed. Some was for us, a little he sold, but most was actually being stored for whatever organization he was working for. 

I wasn’t even shooting up yet. I smoked black tar, blew massive lines of coke, and took Xanax everyday. I thought I was trapped, that I would never leave. Luckily I got out, eventually.

Idk why I’m writing all this. I still get high but now a days I’m very secretive about it, I have to be. No one in my life knows about my past. I have a good job as a promo model/bottle service girl and a swanky apartment, but I lie to everyone about myself. I’m only 21 but I feel like I’m 50. It feels good to write the truth. Sorry it’s a novel, lmk if you want more.

(Long),"So, I am posting via mobile because I had pawned my laptop in the past, and now I'm down to an old phone. I sold my phone too. 

I have been an avid lurker for the last year or two, and I finally grew the nuts to make an account. I almost made my name oxycodone30mgs to poke fun at gangsta, but decided otherwise. What originally made me fascinated with this sub was Morbo's stories. Man do I miss those. I will try to stop babbling now, and get to my story. 

I ""woke up"" at 7:04 a.m. to a phone call from my SO who was sick of my shit and had moved out a week prior. I use quotation marks because we all know how someone sleeps on hour 36 of withdrawal from a daily 500-600 mg oxycodone habit. How do I afford this you ask. Well, I don't. Not well at least. 

I work a fairly decent job, but of course I am in loads of debt and always broke. I probably would have switched to dope a while ago, but for some reason I haven't been able to find it, and truthfully haven't looked very hard because I've been trying to kick for the last year. The weekly cycle we all know. Sober for a week. Using for three weeks. Rinse and repeat. Oddly enough my tolerance does drop, but skyrockets after three days of dosing too often and wasting a load of blues knowing that I need to wait until my high fades. Well, I was back to the point of needing four blues to even get well. 

After waking I had decided that I was too sick to even think about hustling. After three more hours I said fuck it. Started finding any possession I could imagine the pawn shop would take. On my way to the pawn shop I stopped at a cash advance place. That was a fiasco, but after two hours I walked away with two hundred dollars and a 519% interest rate. Genius I know. But the shaking and stretching did not stop the entire time I was in there. 

I immediately call my guy and begin to speed his way. At the first red light I toss the water out of my paper cup knowing that I might puke up the candy I just ate at the cash advance shop. Sure enough I begin to violently puke into the cup. Luckily not all in my lap. I pour out the cup at a red light and continue to puke. 

I finally reach the destination after the longest four hour ride that was actually twenty minutes of my life. To my delight, he was pulling in at the same time I was! He handed me my six and a half blues in my five dollar bill that was my change. Of course my guy that sells for 25 was MIA. He even swapped three of the E8's for an a215, alg, and a k9. I have nothing against e8's but there had been too many around to feel good about the legitimacy of them. 

I immediately snort 3 1/2 and wait in the parking lot to not feel too nauseous to drive. Viola. I head to the pawn shop. 

They look over my plethora of items and I was so stoked to hear that my old ass laptop would be bringing in 70 bucks. Well, of course the new girls computer shuts down and the manager comes to help. She tells me that since my windows 7 isn't authentic that they won't take it. Fuck. Well I still scraped up and extra 90 so three more blues for me. 

I make it home finally and am all smiles. 

Until the sickness returns...

The only time I would get a bump or rash after a shot, was when I missed. 

Fast forward to now. I've been doing just fent (dope barely touches me anymore) for the last 2-3yrs.  I never get a rash from missing a fent shot. Sometimes a little painful bump but thats about it. Now I rarely do anything but my dudes fent, but theres been a few times he was dry an I had to see one of my backups. They usually either have dope or a fent/dope mix. But every time I do something that has any dope in it at all.. I get a bumpy kinda rash near where I did my shot. This happens even if I don't miss any of my shot. It has happened literally the last 20-30 times I did something with dope in it. And it's not just 1 kind from 1 person. Ive tried a ton of diff kinds from 3 diff ppl and it just happens everytime there's dope in it. But I used to shoot dope for years with no issues, and stuff would only pop up when I would miss.

But occasionally, later that day or the next day after use I will get like a dryness and flakey skin on my face around my nose (left and right of the nostrils, right above where my mustache grows. Also the inner rim of my nostrils on the septum aspect can get scabbed over).

Before anyone says levamisole, I'm quite sure that's not it. I've seen the pictures of what can happen to the skin with levamisole, and there is no purple discoloration or sloughing off of the tissue or anything beyond just superficial, like there are no corresponding immune system depletion symptoms, or anything else that would indicate levamisole. Also I use cocaine infrequently, and have never had this occur while smoking crack or going on a coke binge. 

It basically seems to happen once in a great while, and only affects those small areas of skin on the face for some reason, doesn't mess with any other areas of my body. I'm guessing it's a cut in the coke or dope. Just curious if I'm the only one, or if anyone else might be familiar with what I'm talking about. I don't expect anyone to know exactly what the cause is, but it would be great to hear it's not just me and that some other people have experienced this. It would be nice to know I'm not just crazy or missing something obvious. It would also be great to know if anyone might have any insight into this why this might occur. 

BTW, I don't think it has anything to do with itching or scratching, as I don't fuck with my face when high, I do scratch the shit out of every other part of my body though, and enjoy every minute. The way the skin gets scratched raw is way different than what I'm talking about here though.

I fucked up really bad last night. I work in a pretty busy, high end restaurant on the east coast. We were very busy, more than usual, and I ended up nodding off pretty bad on the line. I actually haven’t used in quite a while so I probably shouldn’t have done as many shots as I did that day. Regardless, I made a total ass of myself, one of my coworkers had to pick up my slack and my “cool” boss had a talk with me after work and said I need to get my shit together because if any other manager would have been there I’d have been canned. The whole thing is a blur to me. I told him I was tired. What an obvious bs excuse. My KM at least for sure knows what was up. I’m so ashamed and scared to go back into work tomorrow. I don’t think I’m gonna be fired but at the same time I have nothing to say. No excuse to give. I mean fuck, I’ve been trying so hard to demonstrate how bad I want to move up and then this happens. I’m too embarrassed to even apologize. I can’t admit the truth. It will only Hirt my situation. I’m so goddamn on point 97% of the time. I just feel like such an ass. What can I even say at this point? 

I’m anemic. I took a Xanax because I’ve been so stressed and dealing with death lately. You got me I’m an addict and I slipped up. I know they’re obvious but the scars on my arm are old as fuck. And they are. Super faded track marks I can never get rid of. 

I’m sorry guys. I’m a mess right now. I don’t really think I’m seeking answers I just needed to vent because there’s literally no one I can talk to about this. No one at my job will be forgiving. At least right now. 

I’m done. 

EDIT/UPDATE:

First, you guys are awesome. Thank all of you for the solid advice. I was a mess before work. It actually went ok. I inevitably had to have a talk with my boss but I said I was fucked up saturday, and I’m sorry and embarrassed. He said he appreciated the honesty and asked if I needed help with anything. I said no I’m just going through some personal shit (some of which he knows about). We talked a bit and he proceeded to tell me about the good things I do do, and said if something like this happens again, especially without warning I could face being fired. Anyways. It’ll be ok.

Needles.

I turned seventeen the summer of 2003, between junior and senior years. My friends and I all smoked weed. We had taken Xanax, Percocet, Hydrocodone, mushrooms, ecstasy, acid and all those kinds of intermediate level drugs. That summer this guy popped up and started chilling with all of us and had access to all these crazy, hard drugs, and not one of us had ever seen him before. It was weird because he lived in the heart of uptown. We should have known him. None of us had even heard of him. He said his name was John.

He was a year older than I was and put off the vibe that his parents might have kept him chained to the water heater in the basement or something. Seriously. They must have recognized the absence of any moral sensibility. I used to watch him inject rats full of strange chemicals he carried in a Pink Floyd lunch box and throw them on the floor to writhe around and vomit as they died. There were rings around his eyes and he had this weird walk and speech, like he was not able to relate to other people’s emotions. I always picture him in my mind with a dark purple scar over his eye brow ridge, like Frankenstein or the newly drooling and shuffling recipient of a crudely performed lobotomy.

Anyway. He had this weird thing where he’d only mention what drugs he had over the phone if they were disguised as people’s names. If Dennis was in town, then there was some Demerol in his possession. He liked bottles of phenobarbital and referred to them as Barbara. Val, of course, was valium, and you get the idea. Sometime, right before I turned seventeen, he called me up. He said his friend Dillon was in town, but I didn’t know what that meant. So, we met up.

I walked a few blocks up to the park. Middle aged housewives and college aged kids ran wearing spandex and headphones around the track. Beams of the sun’s last light shone through the canopy of Live Oak limbs. A gaggle of geese squawked after an old man throwing pieces of bread by the mote of brown water around the golf course. Some kids screamed on the playground. Their mothers watched. John stood on the asphalt where the runners ran. He was hunched over and when the runners ran around him, they would turn around like angry deaf people wearing their headphones and scowl at him for standing in their way. Pretty much any place in the 350 acres of park would have been a better place to stand than where he was, but I walked up to him anyway.

He must have heard me, because he turned around and tried to smile. It was an unnatural and ghastly display of teeth, and the awkward expression of his face didn’t help, like he was expecting some visual cue from me that would show him I was satisfied with this display of humanity, like he was looking to see that I believed him to be one of us. Mosquitos and other summer evening bugs buzzed in the bushes and grass around us. Another woman ran around us, pivoting her head on her neck as she passed to keep looking at us.

“What do you have?”

“I said Dillon is in town. From now on, when I say Dillon, I’m telling you that I have Dilaudid.”

“What’s Dilaudid?”

“Dilaudid is Hydromorphone. I hear that they’re eight times stronger than morphine.”

“Sh\*t. That’s all you had to say. How much for one?”

“Well I have k4s. They’re four milligrams a piece. I’m selling them ten dollars a piece.”

I had a hundred bucks. “How many do you have?”

“I have four right now.”

“Here’s forty bucks.” He pulled a balled-up sandwich bag from his pocket and poured them into his open palm. He held them close to my nose.

“See the k4?” A woman with hard face and dark freckles ran by us. She pivoted her head to look at us and saw exactly what we were doing. We kept talking.

“How do you do them?”

“You can snort them or eat them, but they’re really for shooting.”

“I don’t know how to hit a vein.”

“Just IM them.”

“What?”

“Intramuscular injections. Shoot it into your muscle. Skin pop it.”

“Where?” John pulled the back of his sleeve up. He flexed his triceps and turned the back of his arm out towards me. Then, he stabbed an invisible needle into his triceps and used his thumb to push the invisible plunger down. Another couple of runners gawked as they ran by. Beads of summertime sweat formed on my lips and forehead. I slapped the massive chunk of steel he called a hand, said I would see him later and walked back towards my house.",1531239849.0

She was probably in her mid 20s-early 30s. She was leaning forward with her elbows on her knees and every so minutes she’d slip out of consciousness and slowly slump forward until her head was between her knees and her forearms were touching the floor. At one point she almost fell forward out of her seat, but the jolt woke her up and she managed to catch herself. I was sort of keeping an eye on her for any signs that she might be overdosing, but her skin tone was normal and she didn’t appear to be having trouble breathing, and every so often she’d perk up for 30 seconds or so before drifting off again. Even if she’d fallen out of her seat, she would not have been seriously hurt.

I didn’t really feel like there was anything I could do for her - the only thing I could think of was to maybe ask her where she was getting off the train so I could make sure she didn’t miss her stop. But I wasn’t sitting right next to her and I didn’t want to make her any more of a spectacle than she already was by calling out to her. At the same time, it just felt kind of cold and inhumane to watch her nearly passing out and falling on the floor over and over again, with half the train car staring at her the whole time.

I’m just wondering, if I’m in the same situation again is there anything I should do? I am not a user so I have no idea how she would be feeling about this situation and whether she’d appreciate someone asking if she needed help or whether it would just come across as nosy/condescending.",1531232922.0

I've been periodically using codeine for a year now, i stuck to my once a week rule for quite a while, until just a few months back, when i started using almost 3 times a week. The usual dose was 1200mg, but i soon upped that to 1500mg, since tolerance is a bitch (and before you start that codeine has a ceilling limit bullshit on me - just try using 500mg and 1500mg of codeine with antihistamines. You will see a difference clear as night and day) and those ammounts were enough for me to get quite dizzy and even slightly noddy. But i decided to try and cut off this shit once and for all, since my family found out about my use.

So i'm 3rd day in without any use, and all i feel is slightly irritable, a bit twitchy. Nose is a bit runny, but i have no diarrhea whatsoever, just a regular shit once or twice. I feel no urge to use whatsoever, but the fact that i'm having these mild symptoms doesn't encourage me to quit, since they make me believe that i was kinda doing it right, and making these breaks is what kept me from developing a physical addiction.

So, is it possible to use codeine once a week indefinitely and not develop a physical addiction? Or are the symptoms i mentioned are withdrawal symptoms already? Sincce codeine is the only thing in my life i look up to after a breakup from a 5 year relationship and crippling depression that followed.

Also - does withdrawal from short acting opiates set in 12 hours after last use? Because i feel no urge whatsoever to use the next day. None at all. Maybe these withdrawal symptoms are in my head completely?",1531232428.0

In the future, I can see a pure form of 7-ohm floating around, considering that it's roughly 17x the strength of morphine. Especially lf kratom becomes illegal, the pure mitra will be easier to ship. Also considering it's much easier to synthesize 7-ohm from a lab, rather than extracting and separating from pure kratom leaf. The downfall here is that if these chemicals start to form, kratom as a whole will certainly get shut down.

I discovered something crucial tonight that seems so obvi in retrospect :/ about avoiding misses,"Howdy y'all. Just now as I was slam-dunking my last shot of the night (or so I thought), I discovered something crucial, something that's been causing misses for JJ knows how long, something that seems real obvious now looking back... and so I jumped on the laptop immediately to share with my fellow degenerates! (and I *never* do that)

For reference, here's my body type/physical info, this is more likely to happen to you too if you share some or all of these traits, I reckon. I am:

* young & female (29)
* skinny (95 lb) my whole life. eat whatever I want whenever i want (though i rarely want to)
* very little musculature too - just kind of boney :/
* poppin' vasculature. big ol' veins that visibly stick out, blue lines all over. (growing up i always thought it was so gross, esp my hands n feet)
* blood pressure issues like.. easily get headaches from too many pressure-changing motions such as sitting/standing up crouching leaning, palpably feel my pulse in body parts sometimes (just once it was my clit, that was a good day), etc ...

Soo I've been following the advice in [this thread by a medical professional here](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8d0xop/tips_on_iv_drug_safety_from_a_medical_professional/) with great results; it's really upped my IV game and I strongly recommend it, so please don't take this cautionary tale as a reason to discard that advice. (it used to be stickied!) In particular, the new habit I picked up from that post is pushing the plunger down with the tourney stilled tied on, as opposed to removing it after registering but before pushing in, and then leaving the needle in for 10 seconds after removing the tourney.

it also advocates registering multiple times during the process in order to make sure you're still in, as that's the best way to prevent misses. i was already doing that but it's important to note, for the story.

so, i registered beautifully, and looked to me like i was really solidly in there. as usual i kept double-checking as i pushed the plunger in, and each time it was a perfect register. but! some of the pushes began to have that familiar sting of a miss... but then i would double-check, perfect register, continue... and then on top of the stinging, a bump started to form, which is also typical of a miss. but sometimes it can just be a reaction, the key is whether it keeps growing in size... and sure enough, it did, it started getting mighty big... but still, perfect register...

at that point i called to my dear boyfriend to assist. told him to remove the tourney (was sticking my wrist so no spare hands) but then also to immediately squeeze my arm tight, making him my tourney. after some experimenting, here's what i discovered: if he loosened his grip, letting all the blood out, and then i pulled back on the plunger to make a vacuum, it would NOT register. then, holding the syringe and plunger exactly still in that position, i had him squeeze hard again, and sure enough as my arm swelled with blood, THAT caused the rig to register! (and register beautifully)

\*\*(TLDR) so what was happening was that after i had one little miss initially, it like, leaked i guess, into the space outside my veins, and the blood kept pooling there, and THAT POCKET is what i was registering on! see i'm still getting used to keeping the tourney on while i hit, and this is one clear consequence of that. what should've been just a little miss, I FED into a big ol' miss that was most if not all of my shot. ):\*\*

so there you go. i hope my weird story prevents this from happening to someone else. i wish i had takeaway advice/guideline to give you to prevent this but i'm still figuring that out myself. heck, if you have advice in that regard, lay it on me. your girl will just be over here, chillin' on the bed watching The Office with my hand in a little bucket of hot-ass water.

Forgot about them until just now -- about a week in total. Pulled out the open jar (skipped using a lid since the original plan was to pull it back out after a few hrs), and every last drop of liquid was gone.

I've had an opiate addiction for the past 5 years or so of my life, only this year did I finally start breaking the habit and now I've been on and off for about half a year. Started off with the yellow 10/325 narcos, and that progressed up to me eventually smoking tar like I do nowadays. (For all of you still at the weak painkiller phase, I suggest you quit now or you'll snowball into my position or maybe worse) 

Recently I've been having this unusual feeling when I smoke H... I'll take a hit and almost right after my full inhale of smoke, I'll get this lightheaded feeling in my head that lasts around 10 seconds or so, followed along by an amazing body high type rush that lasts another 10-15 seconds. Overall the feeling is highly enjoyable to me, almost similar to how it feels when you do a whip-it. Sometimes this feeling will be more intense, sometimes it won't be... Majority of the time it doesn't happen at all. 
What rose my concern to this feeling was just the other day when it happened, the lightheaded feeling i got was very intense, to the point where my head was swaying, my vision was getting blurry, and I had the feeling that I was actually losing control of how intense it got. Even tho it got to the point it did it was still a very enjoyable head and body rush I got... But I feel like this could be so intense one day that I  actually might black out... Idk if it would be just a simple blackout and I wake right up, or if I'd  asleep for awhile, or if I would OD... Or what... Idk. I figure this could be a result of holding my breath or maybe something to do with the way the foil is burning? But when it happens it's right after I'm done inhaling the smoke off the foil, not toward the end of me holding the hit in. That's what makes me skeptical...

When I smoke I usually don't smoke more then half a gram in one sitting so I'm not smoking a fuck ton or anything. Sometimes this feeling will happen after I've only smoked .2-.3...

Anyways I just wanted to make this post to see if anyone has had something similar happen to them, if so... Do you know what the cause may be?

All I did was buy an ounce of weed every week or so and I'd stop by Clifford's to smoke if I wasn't smoking elsewhere. So anyway, I'm at work when I get a text asking what I'm doing and then was asked to stop by his house after work.

&nbsp;

It seemed to be very important to Cliff to get me to stop by his house on my way home but he didn't say why. I felt stupid for mentioning when I would be getting off work. Hence, upon getting off work at 4pm, I walked, took a bus and walked some more. I didn't commute on a bike back then, so I was less inclined to take a longer detour to avoid Cliff's house.

&nbsp;

As I'm walking up my street with the intent of walking right past Cliff's house, I see Clifford standing in the street waiting to intercept me.


His fat ass knew I had good reason not to visit his house on the way home. So he greets me and hardly explains anything but insistently asks me to come into his house to speak to his mom. So he ushers me in and on to his mother's room where she is lying there in anticipation of my arrival. Cliff's mom asks me if I have $300 to lend out. I tried to act like I cared but almost immediately indicated that I did not have $300 to spare. Realistically, I was thinking of how unreliable Clifford was about paying me back any time he has thrown things on to the 7-11 counter when I was in the middle of purchasing my own shit. He'd toss things down and say ""I'll get you back later"", and he seldom or never got me back. When he did get me back it was in the form of energy drinks during his visit to the supermarket with his mom's money.

&nbsp;

Upon declining to help with the money she then asks me if I can ask my dad for the money. She even said that she would give me a post dated check that could be cashed the very day her Social Security direct deposit comes in when expected, supposedly like clockwork. Now, this is something I would feel very awkward about. What if I really did ask my dad? He would have to ask himself, what kind of people are these? This is not to say you're a bad person if you have needs in an emergency and ask to borrow money but in Cliff's mom's case, she's without the money that is needed because her son spent it and lied. Perhaps he spent it on pills, or perhaps he used to buy food after having spent other money that was earmarked for food. 

It's quite possible that he owed his mom money before a certain utility bill was due and promised he'd have that money on a certain day. He might say, ""Javier the bookie is delivering money I'm owed on Thursday night."" She would then ask, ""Did Javier come by?"" Cliff would say, ""he's coming at 9pm"" then 11pm, 12pm..then she'd fall asleep and wake up at 2am and ask again. Cliff would then say ""obviously not.""

&nbsp;

I cannot and will not have anyone in my house depend on a post dated check from Cliff's mom because shit happens. Maybe the bank has a ""fraud alert"" and locks out the account at an unexpected time. It won't be Cliff's mom's fault, she doesn't mean to screw people but the best excuses don't cover my expenses. Then, what I know now that I didn't know then is how Cliff takes money out of his mom's account as though it's his own. What if he got to the ATM before I or my dad got a chance to cash the check? 

Cliff is not an only child although he lives like one in his mom's dwelling. Why not ask her other son for the money? They already owed him a fuck ton of money, his mom promised to pay him back earlier than was possible because she bought Cliff's lies and planned around them Since they were just that, lies, Cliff's brother did not get his money back on time thereby making it impossible to get him to want to loan money to them in the future. He was at wit's end long before me, he also had the added benefit of not getting addicted to opiates.

&nbsp;

His recent requests for my attention n the past day have reminded me of this story. Yesterday he texted to hang out, offered me a line of drugs that I declined. Then he said he wanted to talk to me **""about making money this week too""**. Alarm bells go off, but at last I'm not gonna put myself in a position to be scammed. He then texted me this morning saying, **""Text me when u awake just for as second please. you're impossible to get a hold of these days!""** He then texted, **""I don't need anything or want to borrow anything so just text me when u have ur morning cup of java.""**

Fat chance. I don't want any stress to be imposed on my while I'm drinking my coffee. 

So I went on to indicate that I was at work, he then asked when I was working until. Two minutes later he texted, ""?""

&nbsp;

I'm curious what kind of scam he is brewing up when he said he had way for me to make money this week but I don't want to enter his dirty ass house. Maybe I'll just ask him what he means by ""make money.""

No time for Cliff's shit, I gotta clean my room because I have a girl coming over this week. Maybe I'll read some literature on flirtation and seduction as well, but I digress. I want to hear what he has to say about making money just for our amusement and make myself clear as possible while I'm at it. If I do go to speak to him, there is no better time to say, ""I'm working on staying clean and have been keeping myself occupied as a result."" Then I have to make up a reason I can't hang out tonight, ""I have work early tomorrow."" I'm not comfortable saying, ""your house is infested with bed bugs, I can't sit here. I only tolerated these filthy conditions because I was addicted to drugs."" 

&nbsp;

If I did speak to him, I would do it after my long bike ride and not before. If I visited him before a long bike ride, I'd have an excuse to not hang out but then he'd hand me his mom's debit card and ask me to pick up soda for him ""since it's on the way."" Better yet, the only thing almost as good than not speaking to him at all today would be to speak to him on the phone. Last I checked, bed bugs can't teleport through phone lines.",1531169736.0

Hey guys, just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this or can give me any insight on why this might’ve happened. Will preface with the fact that my drug experience is incredibly limited, though it is recent. I recently took one clonazepam and drank around 75mL of  dihydrocodeine cough syrup. I understand that it’s probably irrelevant to say that but I’m mentioning it just in case someone thinks it could have caused a bad interaction, although I think its been long enough that they wouldn’t be active in my system anymore. 

Sorry if anything I say is stupid I just wanna include everything I can. 

Last night I took around 30mg of oxycodone, it was in the form of snorting from one 40mg pill. I’ll note that the person I was with did around 10mg himself, and was completely fine. 

In the picture I have of the blister it looks like it says 

Oxycodone 

Sandoz 

oxycodone HCl 40mg

modified release

I don’t know how helpful that information is and I don’t really know what it means. I never saw the pill outside the blister before it was crushed and lined up. I didn’t take anything else over the night, I had maybe 3 drinks and took 3 antihistamines (Allersoothe25 I believe)

I have full, clear memories up until a certain point, and then I completely black out. We took the oxy at around 9:30, I think my memory goes around midnight, ambulance was called from my phone at 3:34am, I woke up in hospital at around 10am. When I’m blackout drunk I still remember some things, or have vague memories, so this is a really strange experience. 

From what the hospital and the person I was with has told me, I had a psychotic break. I do not have a history with psychosis.

The beginning of the break is apparently me accidentally elbowing him in the face, and when he pointed it out, I started elbowing and punching him on purpose. I am not normally a violent person and I definitely physically could not have caused him harm (I’m a 5’5 female, he was not threatened at all and said I could barely throw a punch)

He says I was acting strange for around 3 hours before he called the police and the ambulance. He says I was pacing around the room in my underwear (will note here that I do remember taking my shirt off at the start of the high as I was very itchy), talking gibberish, head and eyes rolling. I was apparently knocking things over and screaming in his bathroom. He would try to talk to me and I would respond with just complete nonsense. The example he gave was when we were talking about video games I responded to a question with “I found a two dollar bill on the sidewalk yesterday morning”

So yeah, just wondering if anyone else has experienced psychosis on oxycodone or any similar drugs, looking it up online gives me basically nothing and everything says opioid-induced psychosis is incredibly rare. Otherwise any ideas of what might have gone wrong would be great too. 

Any insight with what a bad high on oxycodone is usually like would be helpful too, just really looking for some clarity on this situation. ",1531157538.0

They scheduled him for the 4th, which we thought was weird but whatever. We drove the 3 hours and they weren’t open. We just figured they messed up his appt. today I decided to google the dr, and found out he  was arrested for operating a pill mill! We can’t get the office to answer the phone and have no clue what to do right now. Obviously he’s got to get a new dr, by how are we supposed to get his records? He has had surgery on his neck to fuse a couple of discs and also has a spinal stimulator. So he definitely has legitimate pain. 
Do you think coming from that dr is going to affect getting a new dr? Ug. Idk what to do. His meds run out on Wednesday and I’m kinda freaking out. 
Thanks for any advice you may have. ",1531154819.0

i have 1 oxy 40mg pill. it came in a blister so im confident it isnt counterfeit, unless counterfeit pills can come in blisters? (obviously it has certain opioid related dangers!)

id love to try it, can you recommend method of administration and dosage please? i insufflate other drugs relatively frequently, and i dont think it makes much sense to IV a pill considering the binder+filler it contains. 

i would ideally like to insufflate, for the 'rush' ive heard about. ( i understand this stuff is on the internet to research, sorry if this gets removed due to this, but id like a personal opinion!)

my real question however: how intense is the feeling? ive used mdma and acid before, at 0.3g and one tab of 200microgram doses respectively. i understand that these things arent directly comparable, however in terms of physics/mental depth of feeling, could someone help me please? 

i understand the addictive and potentially destructive nature of my pretty little ox pill, however i literally have one i was given, and i know of no-one that could supply any opiate, so the addiction isnt a serious threat to me. basically, not to be 'high and mighty' but people telling me not to use it because it has ruined their lives will not  deter me, i simply cannot build a dangerous addiction right now. 

ive asked here because drug websites tend not to explain this well, and erowid seems either doom+gloom or get me more! will it make me sigh in intense happiness like mdma crystal? or is it a more subtle and relaxing high? thanks in advance",1531154121.0

Well, my biggest concern was how to make it seem like an accident so that the people at the ER won't think I'm crazy. (Well, I kinda am, but that's besides the point.)

Well, I finally figured it out! I could say I was trying to depit an avocado. It's called ""avocado hand"". Seriously, google it. Apparently it's quite common. So I'll just numb my palm with some ice for a bit and then ram a knife through. Sure, it would still be super painful, but that's what I'm after: An excuse to get some IV morphine or some shit at the hospital.

And with any luck I might need a surgery, which means even more fun drugs to score. Man this is going to be so dope (pun intended).

P.S. I actually have a few things I need to do this week so I'll wait until next sunday to carry this out.",1531152786.0
