It takes me 5 seconds to get a hit. Also, the vein never ever seems to scar. I've hit it with dull as shit needles and registered first try. I don't even have to feel for the pulse anymore, just enter where the marks are. 

I remember a week ago, I was fumbling around for an hour or so, trying hands, feet etc. Feet hurt like hell, hands do too. The groin on the other hand seems to be immune to pain. Nicked the artery once on my second try, that was pretty scary to see that plunger pull back on its own. But you know immediately whether you're in a vein or the artery, so injecting into the wrong vessel seems very unlikely to me.

Anyway, just rambling now. Thought I'd share this tip with y'all, make sure to read guides before you poke around in your groin though, it's not exactly safe.",1488377956.0

I really don't even see what all the fuss is about with that. Is it supposed to feel like an alergic reaction? It's like a really intense case of itchiness and pins and needles that feels like it's building to something, but abruptly ends. I get prickles on the top of my head and a warmth but that's it. About 30 seconds of a vaguely good feeling then you're just high. Maybe I'm not doing it right but I've done it with several different ppl who have been shooting for years and they've helped. Also it requires so much to achieve this rush thing it doesn't seem worth it. When I can get a decent high off half as much dope.I guess I'm saying it's overrated. Years ago when I was pretty new(about 1 to 2 years after switching from blues) to sniffing my friend said I was like having a million dicks and they're all cumming at the same time.

My girlfriend is 7 months pregnant and has an infection in two of her back teeth on the same side. The pain started a little while ago but Tylenol fixed it most times. We just thought it was her wisdom teeth coming in, and then two days ago the pain got so bad she was screaming and crying really losing it, a lot worse than it is now and actually spread to her temple, back of her head, jaw, etc. 

So I took her to the hospital they gave her two oxy tens and it practically knocked her out (she's pretty opiate naive only a little experience with Kratom) the doctor also told her that she wouldn't be able to have the tooth extracted I guess because they can't ""put her under"" or even use a local anesthetic until after she's had the baby.

So they prescribed her an antibiotic and hydrocodone 5mg/325mg acetaminophen. WEAK SAUCE I know but I figured it would work for her since she doesn't use any opiates or any prescription drugs besides vyvanse and the like.

 The first day it worked at keeping the pain at bay but she still felt the pressure from the tooth pain in her jaw and head but says she couldn't tell if it was the hydro or from the toothache (most likely the drugs) she felt pretty high (loopy as she called it lol) the first day from just taking 2 of the 5 mg hydros at different times of day for pain. Today she didn't need to take any for the first part of the day until a couple of hours ago it started around 10:30 she took one hydro, then around 11:30 it got progressively worse so I made her take another half about another 30-45 minutes went by still no relief it kept getting worse until it was probably 75% as bad as before she had to goto the hospital I couldn't stand to see her like that so I just gave her the other half 5mg and an extra 5mgs just to get it under control it seems to have made a difference  but the pain is still moderately bad. I'm just trying to figure out the best thing to do. Should she just take more at once cause taking them spread out doesn't work as well cause there still pretty weak for her level of pain. Or is going back to the hospital and tell them it's not working and try to get a stronger hydro or maybe Percocet because at this rate she'll run through her script very quickly (she only got 20). 

Sorry I know it's a lot to read just wanted to give as much info as possible. I used opiates a lot in the past obviously a lot stronger stuff than hydro 5s but now I only use from time to time unless it's PST and don't really know what the best course of action is since she's using it for pain management only.

Few things to note if it even matters: I faked pain at the age 15 at the dentist and I got Tylenol 3 from the help of my mother telling the dentist I'm not good with pain and it keeps me up all night. I was thinking to say that I've been taking Motrin 600mg and Tylenol and left over anti-biotics and it's not taking the pain away at all, I haven't ate right or slept right for the past two nights. Should I mention the tylenol 3 I was prescribed by the same dentist in the past when I was 15? I'm 18 now, if that makes a difference or makes me more eligible for a easier script compared to being 15 at that time. Never really tried hard for an opiate script I'm new to trying to get opiate prescriptions aside from that one time. 

TL;DR; if you don't care about the whole back story, how does an 18 year old such as myself get a narcotic prescription *almost* guaranteed when I go to the dentist tomorrow for my tooth pain that I had a root canal on a year ago & got Tylenol #3 one time in the past when I was 15 from the same dentist from faking pain. Do I straight out be honest and ask for ""something more effective than Motrin & Tylenol 3 as they haven't helped"" Thanks.

These days I really try not to take it because the headache and stomach pain so only take it if in agony, which so far has been no more than once a month

Can oxycodone cause ulcers?

Has anyone else had this? Do you know what could be causing it?

Do you think I should try morphine patches as an alternative?

I'm guessing with morphine patches I wouldn't get the stomach pain. However do morphine patches still give you nausea? I can't cope with the nausea you get from oxy so it would be great to know an alternative. I've taken pepto with oxy before but still get violently nauseous, even if I've eaten nothing I will keep puking till I puke up yellow bile (as there's nothing else to puke).

Now I've been sick countless times in the past 4 years.  Sometimes I'd use those moments to say to my self ""well shit,  I'm already starting day 1, might as well ride it out"".   And just like the 100 times before... 
I never made it past the morning of day 2.


Now. As I said.  I'm on day 4 right now.  I've never made it this far with out subs or  methadone.  But this time I i used clonidine,  gabapentin and klonopin.  And dude.  I kinda actually haven't had a withdrawal problem since day one until today day 4. No joke.  I've slept 75% of the last 4 days,  like full on knocked the fuck out sleep.  I can eat,  walk around the house and mingle.  No anger,  lethargicness  and whatnot.  Side effects?   You feel utterly drunk even if you're a drinker this will make you feel fucked up. So you're kind of wobbly in and out the entire day but there's no withdrawal symptoms zero you're kind of just a walking drunk. And half  you guys are already that so that won't be real problem lol.

I live in an area that has nothing but BTH. It isn't the greatest BTH, usually stepped on pretty good.

I took a dive and bought some ECP and it is on it's way if you catch my drift.

I have been told that each stamp has 35mg (.035) to 50mg (.050) in them. Is this normal? How does this compare to BTH where I could do anywhere from half a point to a full point like once a week IV?

Another thing is, I am on methadone right now. I started a month ago and I am at only 40mg... What am I going to need to do in order to get high off of this? I have researched and everything I have read says the ""blockade"" effect of methadone doesn't work until 60mg. After this foray with this ECP, I am going to have my dose upped. 

TL;DR Basically could you please tell me everything I need to know about ECP.

I think about this sometimes, since my high school years are basically the last ones I can look back on as being ""fun"" regarding my drug use.  


for reference, when I graduated OCs and methadone wafers were still a thing, UFO pants were cool, and not everyone had a cell phone. 


typical highlights of my high school career:

*breakfast was usually a cup of coffee that was 50% liquor with some crushed Xanax and vicodin added for good measure

*splitting fentanyl patches with my buddy at around 10am in English class 

*vomiting in trash cans while walking to class then proceeding as if nothing happened 

*sleeping/nodding in the band room while skipping class 

*getting paid with handfuls of roxies for taking my friend's dad to the pharmacy 

*picking and drying shrooms to sell during the winter for 2x the normal price to pay my car insurance 

*smoking fent patches socially on the band bus on the way back from football games 


those were the good old days.  I miss having basically zero responsibility and gas being $1.25 a gallon.

I have really hard to find veins, which are deep and roll like a bitch, even when I first started. I have already ""used up"" all veins from my finger tips to my elbows, and the ones on the inner side of the knee. 

The veins on my arms are all either extremely hardened or completely disappeared. Sometimes a new vein will form around a the blotched former mess, but those just collapse and disappear even quicker than the original ones.

I am marking my arms up horribly trying to get hits, and they turn numb on me all the damn time now.

I try hitting into my foot sometimes but I'm prone to miss there and a lot of the time that I do that it feels like the rush was nonexistant even though I'm sure I didn't miss.

Since moving to Europe you have to heat and add acid to the powder dope so this makes for even worse problems especially on misses.

So anyone in a similar situation, help me out? I've seen videos of people shooting around the groin and into the neck, and obviously that seems like a bad idea but to be honest I've looked and I just can't see any there anyway. I was hoping to find some on my biceps?

TL;DR Out of veins in my arms and desperate for some new spots because I am just hurting myself every day, and it takes me sometimes an hour or more to hit which even sometimes ends up as a miss because of the bad state of the veins.

I've fallowed this subreddit for months now, mostly reading, but now I decided to write down some parts of my story and what’s happening to me right now. And also I'm here for some advice.  I'm in the opiate game for 3-4 years now. It all started after a few years period of severe drinking + pills (mostly benzos and some opiate painkillers too) + lots weed. When I first met heroin I thought this is what I was looking for. My life seemed to become normal after that crazy mixing period, but it lasted only for 6 months, until I started to iv heroin. Since then I've tried to stop so many times I stopped counting. I've locked myself into the house, been to the countryside, been to NA meetings, went to rehab, but all of these helped just for a few weeks maximum. I always relapsed. Now I'm on suboxon for the first time in my life, and this is my second week. It seems to work, even though I relapsed for one time last Thursday (waited 24 hours before and after my last subo), but since then I'm doing fine. The problem is that I don't know how long. Last week I used because I felt that I'm going insane, I felt that I'm either going to hurt myself or end up in psychiatry, and dope seemed to be the only choice. I'm happy I didn't fuck up completely, but I'm still afraid what if that state will come back and what will I do. It happened so many times before. I don't want to relapse again.  Things are even more complicated cos I got together with a really nice guy, who I think I love, but he is basically an alcoholic, and every time we meet, we start to drink and either my old alcoholic habit comes back in the form of how I can't stop drinking (I even started to drink at home, alone again last week), or I start to count my money and my time to get dope.  Right now I'm home sick (tonsillitis). That’s what keeping me. I'm too sick to leave home.  Meanwhile one of the girls, who I became friends with on rehab and also relapsed, asking me to help her to organize her birthday party, where she wants to try speedball. To be honest, over these years I was always too broke to by coke (which is really expensive in my country), and I've never tried speedbal, even though I always wanted. And now she says she buys the coke, I buy the dope, and we try it together. I don't know what to do. She is asking me how to do it, cos I'm the “big junkie” (she was mostly into pills), but I don’t know how much coke we need for one shot to be honest. Could anyone help me in this? I don't know if I'll join her or not. I still have time to decide, cos her birthday is just at the end of the month.  But let's be honest, I know myself...

So I go to log in to the website to check my balance before I have the middle pick me up and take me to the ATM (yeah I know, shocker...I don't have a car because my parents didn't buy me one like most lucky junkies and after rent and dope I don't have money to save for a car) and the website gives me an error message when I try to login.

So, I call the number on the back of the card to check my balance.  A dreaded prerecorded message comes on saying ""they are having technical difficulties due to an update and hope to have everything fixed in a few hours.""
Fuck.  I download the app.  It works.  Check has not been deposited.

I continue to check until 9:30pm with no avail, until I break down and start asking anyone if they can get subs.  Immediately, someone I haven't talked to in months informs me they have one Subutex left for sale.  $25.  I know, but I was desperate...I have to work tomorrow.  

So I go and grab the overpriced Sub. Get home and take around 2mg to take the edge off.  I check the online website just for the fuck of it.  And of course, my money is on there.  So obviously I tell my middle it never came on, and that I will hit him up tomorrow...because I have effectively thrown a chastity belt on to block any fun.

I swear, every single time I break down and say ""fuck it, nothing is going to work out,"" it magically works out five minutes after.

Sorry for the long story.

I just picked up around a g and a half ir a little more actually of some decent dope a few hours ago. I sat in a wawa bathroom stall waiting a little over an hour and a half awaiting my dboy to arrive. He usually takes like 15-30 mins which really isn't too bad to most shots and is usually upfront and will always answer the phone. He told me to get to the wawa at like and 5:15, I got there at 5:30 to arrive at the same time he did and apparently his kids got out early of some school event and he had to pick them up and drop them off at his family house (all of this is like 30 or a little more mins away from the wawa). 

        Unfortunately he failed to tell me this until 30-40 mins after I arrived at the wawa when I called him, but he assured me wouldn't take long (which usually means 15-20 mins for him) I called him again after 30 more mins and he said he was 5 mins away and to stay put. Him saying being 5 mins away really means he is 5-10 mins away 100% of the time...until today. I kept calling him and told him to be honest with how far he was after he was an hour and 15 mins late already and he said he was 2 mins away. 10 mins go by and I call him again and he says he's 2 mins away and I said ok if you don't actually get here in the next 10 mins I'm leaving and will be spending my 250$ on someone else which I immediately regretted deciding to say because there was like a 25% chance he would probably say ok fuck off don't call me again and he is my only dope connect haha.


         I was just  super pissed and wanted to do dope as it had been 18 hours since my last dose and I was a little bit sick. Only been using for a month with 3 separate 96 hour breaks within that period. Anyway I just felt cold and somewhat achy and restless as fuck. Eventually he arrived 5 mins after I said I would leave in 10 and I told him I was pissed not be used he wastage cus he had an emergency to pick up his children which I understand but because he pulled the typical drug dealer bullshit schpiel and he said man fuck it ain't my fault In a way that told me fuck off you junkie idgaf about u.



        I proceeded to stare him down as if I hated him and told him that you know I'm a great client who gives him a ton of business and I saw in his eyes that he could tell I was right and he said man I'm really sorry, I sincerely apologize snd I said fuck man it's ok just be straight up with me. Needless to say I very much doubt he will ever do this again and if he does as a result of an unpredictable and emergency he definitely won't pull some greasy drug dealer tactic to get me to stay put and keep me in the dark as he Did and simply tell me the truth.



          I could've gone home, smoked some beautiful nugget (sometimes some good flower is such a great way to pass the time and not feel like the clock is being fought over by two tiny little clock maintenance toy armies from France and Germany like I'm World War I in trench warfare (meaning it barely moved at all) chilled for 15 mins or so and gone back which is way better than chilling staring at my phone in the wawa bathroom stall for 2 hours-ish. At the end of the day I'm at home after eating a huge homemade burger and tater tots and a Coca Cola imported from Mexico with the same amount of sugar as a normal Coca Cola but made with absolutely no high fructose corn syrup; the difference is unimaginably significant. Anyway sorry I got so into detail on that time passing by slowly analogy I'm on h but also smoked a little of the devils lettuce which he rubs dandruff onto to create trichomes.

Little background about me.Had a back injury at work which got me a script of norcos.never before had I enjoyed a drug so much. Up the latter I went to percoset,then oxy 40s,60s,80s,then opanas.you get the gist

I had tried to kick pills more times then I can count.I made it 10 agonizing cold turkey days,no lope or kratom. I finally caved in because of the insomnia and lack of appetite.

A year ago my doctor cut all his patients down to comply with the new CDC guidelines and because of pressure from a certain 3 letter agency. The drastic cut threw me for a loop and I wasn't able to hack the new dose. Mind you I was taking 240mg of op's a day and 120mg of 30's per day. I was sometimes taking 5 to 600mg a day on rough days.

Make a long story short I started using BTH when I would run out of pills to fill the void.I had made it 6 years without messing with heroin. But because of circumstances and brutal withdrawals I went to the street for relief.

Currently because of this I burned through any assets I had,spent all my money almost on black and only got a break when my pills got refilled.We all know the pills hardly work any more once you go to H.

Right now I'm homeless,sleeping in my car or staying in a hotel.I feel like I'm drowning and I don't think I can hack this much longer.The game has really taken its toll on me.I tried kicking today but caved in because I was tired of the wd's. 

Any advice on how you quit and what made you finally say enough is enough? Sorry for shit post made TLDR for the people who don't want to read.

I don't know if it was the xanax or hydro that got me in a super good mood? I take xanax occasionally, adderall for work, and I'm no pothead who smokes all day but I like weed. I can get my hands on hydro whenever I want I just don't want to become addicted. I've never been addicted to xanax but I know opiates are highly addictive so I was wondering how many days break I should take I should take breaks off hydro to avoid addiction? And no it didn't get me the first time I'm not addicted to anything even though it runs though my family. I have access to A 333 Hydrocodone. I can get them whenever I want but I don't want to ""take"" much I think most of you know what I mean haha.

Just have a few questions about Fentanyl W/D, etc. I've been using Fentanyl nasal spray roughly 14 of the last 31 days spaced out usually every second or third day. On the days I don't use I don't notice any withdrawal symptoms at all, not even a ""hangover"". Each spray dispenses ~70ug and I usually only have 1 spray at most (2 half sprays) on the days that I use it. So yeah, just wondering if I continue like this for a few months what sort of w/d I would be facing.

Oh and please don't give me the ""STOP USING RIGHT NOW, FLUSH IT AWAY AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT"" standard response. I've been using heroin and oxy off and on for the past 2 and a half years and never have faced any sort of withdrawal whatsoever and never had a problem stopping for 4-6 months at a time.

He IV'd .4 grams of BTH and .2 grams of good quality powder. He did not inform me that he took 2.25 mg of Xanax about 2 hours prior.  

Pretty standard story follows... He shoots up, I talk to him for probably 15-20 seconds, ask him if he's okay, he said ""Yes"" and immediately fell out. Lost consciousness, stopped breathing, started turning blueish/purplish. I checked for breath, checked for a pulse, noticed niether. I'm doing this while driving mind you... I was screaming his name, punching his chest, threw a cup of water on his face and lap. No changes, no reaction, no response. I threw on the emergency flashers, sped through busy intersections, and made it to the closest emergency room about 4 miles from where we were. I ran inside, told them friend had OD'd on Cocaine and Heroin, and lost consciousness in my front seat. They pulled him out of the car, and at that moment he kinda came to. Unfortunately, he was so confused, he thought they were cops and he was being arrested so he started resisting. After he passed back out, they wheeled him from the porte-cochere to the ER center, or a room, whatever is behind the big double doors. The nurse told me to move my vehicle out from the front of the ER and when I got back she would take me to where he was at.

So I drive around the lot for a bit, park, and just try to calm down. About 5 minutes later, I see my friend walking by. I pick him up and he says, ""let's get the fuck outta here!""

I proceed to tell him everything, and how he stopped breathing for about 3 minutes. He also asked why his chest was so sore, and I explained that I had hit him over and over again trying to get any sort of response. Naturally, his reply was, ""Well I guess you are saying I owe you a few licks then don't I?"" 

He did get up and walk out of the hospital on his own accord. The medical staff was telling and begging him to stay but he simply refused and walked out. They did not give him any Narcan or Naloxone, so I just dropped him off at his house and needless to say he is still very very very very high.

I guess my real question is, How likely or easy will it be for him to OD in the future? Whether he decides to do another shot in 5 minutes or 5 days from now, is there any evidence that this situation will make it any easier or harder to happen again? For example, if a MMA fighter takes a solid punch to the chin, he is more likely to be knocked out in future fights... The more it happens, the less trauma the brain can handle, therefore lights out much easier than day 1.",1488410351.0

Since then I have gone through various phases of usage and have faced the usual perils of lost job/girlfriend/college/opportunities/etc. I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about. 

In that time I have tried to get clean 4 times, gone through inpatient detox with either methadone or suboxone twice, and did a 2 month IOP rehab type thing. About four months ago I started using needles and things obviously went downhill fast. I ended up going into inpatient detox about 3 weeks ago and came out feeling very determined. Unfortunately here I am again using daily. 

When I was in detox multiple docs asked me if I was interest in maintenance. I told them I wasn't, largely because of the horror stories I've heard about trying to get off of it. However now I'm reconsidering that. After doing the IOP I managed to get about 5 months of clean time. Other than that I have not had much luck with any other methods. Unfortunately my insurance will not pay for that again for quite a while, however they would pay for subs. 

I've got a lot of good shit coming up in my life that I'm really scared of fucking up and I know I will if I'm using. I really would like to get clean but I find myself picking up anyways. I know I need help somehow and I dont feel as though I have found it in NA or therapists or anything and I'm wonding if subs would be that helping hand to get me back on track with my life. 

I want to know what your experiences have been with maintenance, is it worth it? What are the pros and cons? Or just general thoughts?

So a little background. I have an awesome middle, I have been going through her for about 7-8 years now, always legit, the only thing she is into crack big time, she's an older lady got health problems blah blah blah. She never pinches but sometimes I have to throw her extra cash off the cash I know she is obviously making off me, because who does shit for free.
 
For the past 2-3 years I've been getting oxy from her dude, I've taken her over to the house plenty of times and dude has seen me numerous times and we've introduced our selfs, I would never try and step on her toes blatantly because she is a good person inside/out. But a couple days ago she said her dude had some perc 10s and some ir 10s both for 15$ each. I've been paying the 15$ for the ir because fuck, supply and demand. I wasn't happy with the 15$ for the percs though. I asked the person I was taking over there if he would please try and talk him down because that was to much. Long story short. Ole dude came out to my truck before the guy could go inside and get them. He talked to me and told me it would be 110$ for 2 IR and 9 percs. That's not what I was told the price was!! I said yes before the guy I took could say anything. So I got them both for 10$ a pop. Finally a break from the constant overpaying

So here's where my master plan comes into, I work as a landline telephone repairman. Guess who still has a landline? Ole dude that gets my sweet oxy. So I was thinking of getting dudes number and creating a trouble ticket for it, and rolling through, and just spark up convo .Like I said earlier I don't want to step on toes, but also in the same breath I'm so tired of over paying. 

Tl:dr I wanna set up a way to get the PLUG but don't want to step on toes.

I was always so proud of being careful, and doing test shots, and how I've never had to be hit with narcan before in 10 years of smashing down.

Frankly, it was fucking terrifying; especially coming to (apparently I tried to go down to the office, passed out and started seizing on the stairs. At least I managed to leave my room), feeling like I was stuck in limbo with no awareness of my body or anything going on around me. 

If it weren't for my spanking new hospital bracelet, bruised sternum, neck etc. and the video surveillance proof, I'd be tempted to brush last night off as some horrible nightmare.

My memory's spotty as hell and my brain keeps fritzing. I'm still trying to process things, and I'm not sure how I feel about telling any of my friends of mum just yet.
On the plus side, I think this was possibly what I needed to finally quit for good.

I like many of you have suffered with severe pain for several years. I've been on a variety of painkillers in the narcotic family as well as benzodiazepines and other atypical antidepressant drugs which were all meant to try and ease the pain that I was feeling. Recently my doctor and I have found a regiment of taking Norco 10–325 mg. However, I was worried about the acetaminophen within these and the fact that I would wake up in the morning in pain. We talked about a new type of drug that was a 24 hour extended release version of hydrocodone that did not contain any acetaminophen

This new drug is called higsinglia er which is made by Purdue pharmaceutical. Are used their discount savings coupon and without any insurance was able to pick up a month supply for $25. Not only did I wake up for the first time in probably over a year or more without any pain, but I am taking less of my other medications and just feel in an overall better mood. I know that not everyone well respond the same to each type of medication and that some people do not respond to hydrocodone as well as other opioids. However if this medication does work for you and your reached the ceiling limits on acetaminophen. I would encourage anyone to talk to the doctor about getting this new type of drug as it is not as strong as the other extended release oxycodone opioid choices. 

Also just wanted to add that I already posted a similar comment in a different thread for chronic pain. And I'm not trying at all to do this is an advertisement but simply inform people of a drug that is new and had the opportunity to experience yet

Any and all signatures help. HB 2163 looks to put unfair restrictions on life saving medications used to treat opioid dependency and addiction. If it passes it will make hundreds if not thousands of patients lose access to medication over night. It is trying to prohibit doctors from writing mono buprenorphine to anyone that isn't pregnant. Many patients have been going to OTP clinics because they cannot have suboxone and had to dose there daily for over 40 days to get a single take home bottle and it takes 12 months to earn 6. These patients will lose access to treatment because it also prohibits FEDERALLY licensed clinics from dispensiing in take home bottles. Patients will be forced to dose in person, even know the more dangerous drug methadone people will still get their take homes. Buprenorphine with or without Naloxone is the safer choice, and to cut someone out of treatment simply because they have a hypersensitivity to Naloxone isn't right. I ask for people to sign this petition, it asks for the bill to be amended to include people that have a hypersensitivity to Naloxone to also be able to get prescriptions, and allows the federally licensed clinics to dispense it in take homes.

There was a supreme court hearing 2 years ago on this issue. Rodriguez Vs. United States. They will however let you go if you show them you know your rights this will not stop them from following you and repulling you with a k9. (Happend to me).

5x8s3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5x8s3u/question_about_bundles/,73,https://redd.it/5x8s3u,inEuph0ria,Question about bundles,"I see so many comments on this sub where people claim to pay insanely cheap prices for a bundle.

So..I want to get an idea of what exactly people consider a bundle in their area.  No need to name areas...don't need sourcing shit going on.

But seriously...I have seen people say that a bundle is 9 bags. I have seen people say no it's 10. The most popular...is people saying its 12 bags.  And then some people claim to get a baker's dozen (13) and some even claim 15 bags per bundle.

I am from Florida.  I have never seen a stamp bag.  And I have never seen a bundle.  Generally it is sold in points (.1) for anywhere between $20-40 in my area.  And a gram (that actually weigh a gram) is anywhere from $150 if you have a godly connect, up to $300.

I was always under the assumption that a bundle was a gram...because logically it just makes sense.  

So..in your area...how many bags make up a bundle?  How much is in each bag?  How much does your bundle go for?

I have seen people claim to get bundles for $35 bucks.  And I can't imagine that it is anywhere CLOSE to a g.  

Let's be honest here guys...what does a bundle really weigh and cost in your area?  What about if you actually wanted a weighed out gram?  Do dealers that sell bundles not fuck with grams?",1488521281.0

Hey guys I'm new to opiates and I've only taken one of these once along with 10mg of Xanax and some weed, it was amazing! I made a post about this explaining how I don't get addicted to things but know I opiates are highly addictive, hence the other post I made trying to grasp how often I can take opiates without becoming addicted. Now since I understand that 3-4 days apart should be okay I want to know how many of these I should take along with Xanax and weed to get really high? Also if matters, these are pharmacy grade. No shitty pressed pills straight from the pharmacy ;) 

No I'm not saying I'm planning on getting high ""as many times as I can not to get addicted"" I just want to be safe I probably won't  be popping them once a week lol. Only on occasion Thanks!",1488515908.0

it is fucked up

so tonight im coming home. i was at school from 8-11, work from 11:30-5, and then with my parents kinda having a major group cry/fucking heartbreak session

so i drive home to meet a friend here who i owed a little money to. they beat me here by mere minutes. i get a call while im in the parking lot driving up and she says that security had forced them out of the car and took their IDs and shit. so i'm trying to hurry and get there to help them out and not let them get harrasseed or whatever

so i get there and the security guard is actually a real off duty cop. i smelled like weed kinda but still, he totally went crazy and wouldnt let me do anything. searched me, took my bowl out of my pocket and looked through my car with a flashlight

radio'd his buddies, the on duty cops, who showed up practically within seconds. 

*THEN I WAS CUFFED* and told i could be detained for being uncooperative, kept asking permission to search my backpack. i said i ""would prefer them not to"" - the cops claimed that it was a hardcore ""no"" and started carrying me to their car and saying that my refusal was probable cause to get a warrant and search my shit. 

sometime talked them into uncuffing me and letting them search my backpack which had my klonopin script and 2 books in it. 

all i kept saying was that i'd had a 15+ hour day and that it was cold (like 45 degrees here tonight!!) and i was just trying to go the fuck home and crash the fuck in bed

how legal was this? they let me go, let me keep my bowl and my grinder which i had forgotten was in there actually. i apologized for driving with it and for not keeping it at home, and that i'm glad someone is looking out for the roads and i'll be more careful in the future. which i will. but still

the whole thing felt very invasive and not cool; i'd pulled up at my apartment and parked, and was just trying to go the fuck home

EDIT: oh and thanks to JJ that i didnt get arrested. currently i actually have no opes on me or in me but damn i live in _________, a very southern state with very draconian laws still. the cops were cool with me having weed but not with driving with it/smoking while driving even though no proof of that was established. anyway, my life coulda been ruined by that so i am so thankful to have been let loose",1488514552.0

I appreciate whoever posted on my last few copping threads. I'm trying to make this a daily thread again as it used to be one when I just was a lurker on this sub. Anyways, compared to yesterday today's cop was super easy for me. I didn't have to wait for two hours. I showed up at the wawa where I usually meet my dude expecting to wait 15-30 mins for him to get there. It turns out he was there waiting for me actually already serving the guy I got who gave me my dealers number who I hadn't seen in a bit. I hopped in his car, gave him 250 for a little over a g and a half and he handed me another extra quarter gram as an apology for making me wait two hours yesterday which is fucking awesome. What goes around comes around I guess :). I just woke up after taking a quarter bar earlier in the day and doing a few lines. 


       I woke up at my desk in my room where I usually  do lines with the 1.5 gram bag that I had just copped unopened and with the quarter g bag he gave me for free hardly half empty. I had nodded off from the quarter bar. Don't worry guys I know it's dangerous to mix the two but I did like half my usual dose for h, and ended up getting what I wanted, a nice nod. Anyways it's 10:45 on my coast and I'm about to do some more lines from this quarter g bag and dig into my 1.5g bag.

I dropped off my script for my Adderall today at a pharmacy and when I picked it up instead of Adderall it was Vicodin 5 milligram tablets. There were 60 of them and I didn't realize it until after I took a couple and read the imprint plus they were shaped oddly for Adderall. 

I called the pharmacy and went back and apparently the actual pharmacist who runs it was the one who made the mistake they even slapped on a new label with my name on it over the previous label of whoever the hydrocodone was supposed to go to. I raised hell and it first she only offered me a $20 gift card but I eventually got my script for free.

 I have a feeling one of the pharmacy techs probably browse is this forum but this was the craziest thing that has ever happened to me and I'm lucky that I wasn't a young kid otherwise I could have died because of their mistake.

Edit I am still somewhat in shock over what happened. I am on suboxin so they wouldn't have done anything for me but I cannot believe this big of a mistake happened because I've had scripts that were one pill off but this was 60 Vicodin instead of 60 Adderall",1488510885.0

I usually meet him on a side street and hop in his car so it seemed more acceptable when he would dig in his pants for my shit, completely disgusting, but still arguably acceptable. 

Today though I meet him at his apartment. I'm standing in the entrance, wondering why, even in this situation, I'm waiting an extra 10 minutes for him to serve me. His door is literally 10 feet from where I'm waiting. I also look at my phone. 

My concentration is broken by the sound of his door opening. I look up and await his appearance from around the corner. I see his foot first and then time slows, he's in full view. And he's digging in his pants. 

I'm momentarily lost in thought. What the fuck is going on here? Does he just keep his dope constantly tucked under his nuts? He's in his home so why is this happening here and now?

My trance is broken by the smell. He's now standing in front of me and has just extended my score out to me. My stomach flips. I instinctively begin breathing through my mouth to avoid the smell. This smell is impossibly disgusting. I hand him the money, thank him and quickly transfer the dope from hand to jacket breast pocket. 

While smoking a cigarette on the way home I get a whiff of dude's ball smell on my hand and gag again.

He knows exactly when to come around what corner at what time to make to switch after I make the obligatory ""I'm 2 minutes out"" call. He says ""yo gotta hit you with some new shit to try goods are different today"". This has happened before and I'm not shocked..

The one handed exchange goes just like clockwork.. And as I pull my hand in the window and start to feel the difference (i normally get 2 g's of east coast brown fire) and about to say what the fuck, I hear a faint ghetto hola as he walks off in the direction he was headed.. ""be careful with that!""

I've had my fair share of the grey madness that's going around and a $1000 a week habit after more years in the game than I'm  happy to admit. But this shit.

You guys be careful out there I just hit a point of this and almost got high.. If I was a 20 year old without a the tolerance that comes with multiple decades banging dope I'd have been dead before the plunger stopped. It's got legs.. so I'm fairly sure it's not fent as I've used plenty and know the depressing let down when you realize you aren't getting off tonight.. I've seen some other posts tonight about new shit so i thought I'd give a ""hoodeehoo"" and let my southern east coast brethren know.. be careful out there,  there's fire in them there hills.

But it also comes to mind that if I do 10 a point in town 1, I won't be maximizing profit, but more people will be coming to me and it'll sell faster, because it's cheaper.

fantastic film, but the scene in which Vincent scores some brown before taking Mia out, his dealer offers him a plethora of different batches.

some are $300 a gram and the one he buys is $500 a gram.

what the fuck is this shit? is this tarantinos naivety of the drug scene and it's prices?

I'd expect at least an eight for $300.

anyone else like to watch tv/movies that involve Heroin so you can shoot with the character and sort of both experience it together?

some actors that are clean are fantastic at playing a stoned guy.

btw: **before the devil knows you're dead** - Phillip Seymour Hoffman in the leading role, drug addled and IV Heroin user. 

there's a fanatic long drawn out scene as he camera follows him through the apartment as he proceeds to roll up his sleeves, makes himself a drink then passes out with the needle still in.

now that scene hits very hard in hindsight, because I can guarantee he was at least popping oxy to get into the opiated character.

Sometimes I would go a whole week on it using about a bar a day and on the 7th day I didnt notice any increase in tolerance. 

Since starting using opiates again so I kinda stopped using xanax as much and only when needed. The other week I wanted to get fucked up off it and I couldnt. I ended up drinking about 3 pints of beers ranging from 6% - 9 % abv and took 2 1/2   double G's and didnt feel Fucked up at all really, Just a slight buzz at most. And on another week I had smoked early day and got some mylan pie xanax and took 3 (within 3 hours of each other) of them because they werent fucking me up, again just a slight buzz or whatever you wanna call it. I know these things are not fake  I have other friends getting super fucked up off the same exact pills Im getting, One of them being a fellow opiate smoker. Today being a week and a half since I last took xanax I took a whole green bar, Kinda felt good for a slight 20 min or so then disappeared yet the forgetfulness and dumbness of being on a bar stood with me for a couple hours, For Ex. Me forgetting where i left my keys, my wallet, a game controller, charger. 

I plan on kicking the opiates again within the next week or 2 after using for about 2-3 months as Ive done it before a few times and before this I was clean off opiates for about 2-3 months and before being clean I was on opiates for about 4-5 months and at this time period xanax effected me the same even when using opiates. This time around it doesnt seem to be hitting me as hard no matter what. Hopefully the xanax takes full effect after kicking opiates again. Just wondering if any of you have any clue why theyre not effecting me or hitting me as hard as they should be. The only thing I could think of is Opiate use???? But as i said I used before and it never affected my xanax high. Im really confused to this lol.

This worked for both Benzodiazepines and Opiates.

This is NOT potentiation,, and could even throw you into precipitated withdrawal if you're doing it at the wrong time of the day. (i.e. you take the drugs and THEN do this. this will cause whatever youve taken to leave your system extremely quickly.) Do it BEFORE (id say 12 hours before) you take a dosage, and take a little less than you normally do because there will be less drugs in your system after using this method.

another optional thing, you might laugh, is the kinoki cleansing detox pads.


check it - i totally detoxed with this stuff in under a week. i was on subs for 4 years! with a 4 month break and a 1 month break! I was started at 34mg! hope this works for you, for whatever you may be taking. (actually has been 8 years now since i originally wrote this).


So if you're using it to quit - 
i have more to add like i only ate rice pudding and stuff even though i was not nauseas, just not hungry.
ibuprofen for headaches
something to goto bed if you need it
something for the runs if you need it (Immodium AD,Pepto,Etc).


if you're withdrawals are really that bad, do all this, check with your doctor, and take a shitload of tranqs and knock yourself out for the last few days of the major withdrawn symptoms.

Tips for overcoming W/D symptoms:


1. DISTRACT YOURSELF
I could not possibly stress this enough. Those of you who've ended up on this website are probably a) somewhat intelligent (or at least computer-adept) and b) somewhat introspective / introverted. This means that you're probably going to spend most of your day thinking about how you're feeling and cataloging the symptoms you're experiencing. The problem with this is that the mere process of self-analysis is creating and amplifying your symptoms!!!  


2. CREATE YOUR DEFENSE
What I mean by this is; Arm yourself with whatever will possible help you get through this, both physically and psychologically. Get yourself some relatively benign medications (aspirin, etc) and when you are experiencing pain, take one. (not more than is medically sound). This helps not just because of the actual effect of the drug, but because you feel as though you've got the edge now. You're not trapped, you've got your little army of medications (aspirin, melatonin(sleep), chamomile tea(also sleep)) to help you get through this.  


3. STAY ACTIVE
This is pretty self explanatory, and it helps in multiple ways. First off, while you're active, you're hardly ever thinking about your symptoms. When I went through my methadone withdrawal, I spent 8-12 hours each day chainsawing through trees, and during those hours, I felt (relatively) alright. Staying active also helps because it will increase your odds of getting a good nights sleep.  


4. EAT HEALTHY
Remember that everything you put in your body is helping to get the toxins out of your body. Every trip to the bathroom means slightly less opiates in your system!

In Summary,
You're cleaning out your body. 
Out of ALL of the supplements, the ones that i used the most to keep my tolerance low were the 
Here is where i would place them on my chart on what i think works the best, but i actually was using almost all of them as much as i could while staying within the recommended daily dosages.


In order of importance to me:

1) Acai Berry Extract, *probably the most important in my opinion* .


2) Super Juice Vegetable and Fruit Daily Multi Phyto-Nutrient Formula vitamin


3) Fiber!!


4) A supplement like fruit juice extreem that contains lots of extracted fruits. (ACAI, Blueberry, Goji Berry, Mangosteen, Hawaiin Noni, Black Cherry, Resveratrol, and more, high antioxidants!)


5) Cranberry Extract(take lots)
Apple Cider&Vinegar Extract


6) Tea, Green Tea, and Green Tea Extract (these worked great too in combination with the acai)


7) Biotin, Beta Carotene, Omega 3-6-9, lutein (just healthy shit!)


8) Protein


9) Colon Cleanser 


10) Milk Thistle (IF YOU NEED IT - this will help protect your stomach and liver.)

lastly, never take any of these on an empty stomach. at bare minimum coat your stomach with milk . 


annnd if you do try this like i said be very careful with your subsequent dosages as your tolerance should be lower.

After searching for a proper vein I pushed off and after a second felt the usual pins and needles start. Suddenly my whole body was all strong pins and needles feeling and then I started to shake. I don't mean a little wiggle here and there. I mean almost seizing, uncontrollable tremor with occasional ticks where I would twitch uncontrollably. 

At this point I was like wtf is going on? Am I having a seizure?  Am I overdosing? What is this and why won't it stop? I tried to calm myself for about 20 minutes, chain smoking cigarettes because it was the only thing that felt right.  I had gone to meet my connect 20 minutes on the highway from home. ""How am I going to drive like this?"" I thought. 

I calmed myself slightly and the ticks stopped just the tremor remained after a half hour. I moved my car a few spaces and figured out I was not ready to drive yet. I decided to get out of the car and see if I could walk this off. I got out and walked a bit to the McDonald's and went inside. 

Walking felt ok. I wasn't shaking as bad when I was walking. Even though it's in the low 40s here and I was wearing thin yoga pants, a t-shirt, and a thin sweatshirt I wasn't really cold. Sweating in fact. 

I walk into McDonald's and make a beeline for the bathroom. I sit on the toilet, trying to take deep breaths and close my eyes to try and calm myself. While my eyes were closed I felt a little bit of that sleepy dope feeling come over my whole body and mind that would rip away as soon as my eyes opened. I sat there for a few minutes and then walked back to my car. 

At this point I think I'm okay enough to get home. In the back of my mind I'm having visions of myself crashing into all kinds of shit and trying stuff down my panic, get it together, and make it home safe. 

I made it home safe. I have never been happier to see my house, ever. I go right upstairs and get in the shower since at this point I have 45 minutes to get to work. After the shower I got ready and went to work and that's where I am now. The tremor has calmed but is still there. I was almost thinking maybe I just had a panic attack but I've never had one that gave me the shakes like this before. I also feel that the shakes would be gone now if it was a mental thing that caused a physical response. 

I used a fresh piece of cotton from a q-tip as a filter. So I don't think it's cotton fever. Which I've had before and this was much different. I rinsed my cooker with water before adding my gear but I guess there could have been bacteria there that remained after I rinsed. 

Has this happened to any of you before? Any idea what would cause this? Am I just a basket case? Any input would be helpful. Thanks. 

Tldr; Did shot of dope, got pins and needles then severe tremors that still remain however less intense a few hours later. Any idea why?",1488581635.0

Currently on day 3 of being off 4 months on Tramadol. It's not fun, I've picked up a few Hydrocodones yesterday that helped me get some sleep finally, and I have a 1mg Klonopin that I'm saving as a worst case scenario. But man, this sucks. I've been using opiates off and on for about 4 years now, just mild usage, never more than a few months at a time, and this is the second time I've ever had to endure the withdrawals. I consider myself lucky, knowing how mild my symptoms are compared to other people that have been using for years, but it still sucks ass. What are your withdrawal stories? I'm using this as something to distract myself from the hell. No one close to me knows what I'm going through, not even my girlfriend that lives with me, so it would be nice to talk to some people about it. Before I picked up the Hydrocodones to help sleep, I was using a mix of NyQuil, Melatonin, and Unisom, none of which helped whatsoever. Wednesday night I took a ""shot"" of NyQuil, 9mgs of melatonin, and 2 tablets of Unisom, that bought me about an hour and a half worth of sleep. But I felt so weird when I woke up from that. I felt like I was wearing a weighted suit. My arms and legs were so heavy, but I still couldn't sleep worth a damn. Sorry for the rambling, I'm also on 20mg of Adderall for ADHD and it gets a little carried away sometimes. So what kind of stories do you have? And has anyone else had experience with Tramadol? You may find it strange, but I seem to prefer it over Hydrocodones, I can't explain why, but my body just feels so much better on it. Anyways, thanks for reading. :)

I know I am, got myself a gram of o-desmethyltramadol on Tuesday (I know not the strongest opie but it's all I need) and have been looking forward to taking it today all week. Previously in the past there's been times where I couldn't resist the urge to dose it as soon as I get it and even a few days in a row but this time I'm committed to only taking it biweekly (I know, good luck with that lol. But I'm going to try).

This leads to another question- how many opiod enthusiasts out there practice strict discipline when it comes to their dosing and manages to only take it when they see appropriate as to not build tolerance or get addicted. It's a huge test of willpower but how many of you are able to do this? Probably is even harder with something like H.. like how many of y'all are disciplined, functional users?

The caller sounded a little on the young and nervous side, but nonetheless a typical call. White male in an affluent neighborhood, guaranteed money. 

“We’re going near the res” I told her, expecting a little enthusiasm since this usually indicates small penis and big tips. 

The remark was met with silence, although we hadn’t made much cash yet, I think she was secretly hoping the phones would be dead so she could go inside and get some sleep. That’s one thing about hoes, once they make enough for drugs/nails/hair/food, they get lazier than a 2 year old that needs a nap.

“For how fuckin much because I ain’t doin no fuckin half hour at 3:30 in the morning” 

“It’s an hour” I said with a smile. “And it’s also not 3:30” I added, pointing to the digital clock in the dash of my Mercedes. 

She slinked back into the seat, and I punched the address into my GPS. We were only 7 minutes away, and I had given him an ETA of 15 minutes. Usually men would be ecstatic at pussy arriving early, but when we pulled into the driveway and called, he seemed a bit taken aback and frazzled. It was at this point I suspected a robbery or something more sinister. 

“We’re outside”

“Ok, one minute.. just uh, getting ready”

I hung up. The house was full of floor to ceiling windows and I was peering inside intently, hoping to gather some clues as to what could be going on. As always, greed wins and I sent her in unsure of what was afoot. As always, I had my .45 in the trunk in case things went awry. 

“What should we do, I don’t see anybody?” she said.

“Just go to the door” I said impatiently, turning the car and lights off in hopes he wouldn’t notice she came with a driver. Although this call was close to home, there is NOTHING worse then going to a call  and having the guy bail last second because the driver makes him nervous. 

She walked up the stone steps cautiously and I was staring at the door trying to make out who would be greeting her. 
“God I hope this is just one normal white guy” I thought to myself, remembering the group of polish men also from the area that attempted to rape one of the other girls I had employed years before. That’s another story for another day..

A few minutes pass and it seems to have gone smoothly, she wouldn’t walk into a house she wasn’t totally comfortable with. I’ve worked with an assortment of women, *Sandra wasn’t one that even particularly needed me, we had just been friends for more than 10 years and she didn’t have a car or credit card at the moment, so we became partners. Point being, when she smells bullshit, she usually had something in her own purse to protect herself with, and the robberies were always reversed between the two of us.

“Ari come upstairs NOW! You HAVE to meet my FRIEND Rachel”
“umm ….ok” 

I desperately was trying to discern from her voice if there was trouble there or this really was her “friend” Rachel. Why would she have a “friend” at a call at 3 in the morning, why would there be a female around when a man is paying for sex? This is typically an activity one does in private, as you may have guessed. 

I grabbed my smith and wesson folding knife from the driver door and shoved it in my pocket. Cautiously, I made my way up the wraparound stone steps looking like a half assed cat burglar. I stood about 5 feet away from the door and wrapped my fingers around my knife, gripping the flip tab so I could have it ready in an instant if this was some sort of weird attempt at a kidnapping.

Sandra was smiling ear to ear, and behind her WAS a tall red headed women. What the fuck? I was still very confused, and when she opened the door, things came crashing together in an instant.

“Hi. I’m rachel” came the deep voice from underneath the wig. It was a fucking TRANNY.

Now, not that I have a problem with trannies, but you are supposed to disclose fetishes BEFORE we arrive to your doorstep, it’s just the common courtesy in this business. She welcomed me warmly and asked if I wanted a shot, clearly extremely nervous and on edge. 

As soon as the door shut, Sandra started to fill me in on what happened in the five minutes that I spent anxiously waiting in the car.

“Bitch, when she opened the door, I was like hoe your man called me! I don’t got no time for no fuckin games. Then she handed me the money and told me to just leave, then it all hit me! So I calmed her down and asked her to chill out! isn’t she beautiful?”

I’m pretty sure Sandra’s blood alcohol level was about .75 at this point, because “beautiful” wouldn’t be the first adjective I used to describe Rachel. She was about 6 foot 2, 275 pounds, covered in hair, and let’s just say that hair could really use a brush and some maintenance. Still, I know the game inside out, so out poured the compliments for JJ Watt in a wig. 

“Girl why didn’t you just tell us!” I said smiling. I was also surveying the house trying to ascertain how deep her pockets were. Viking fridge, check. Brand new black granite countertops, skylights. Yeah, We need to treat this customer with care.

“Well you’re ad said fetish friendly so.. I didn’t think you’d mind” she said sheepishly, hiding behind her raggedy tangled wig. It’s as though Sandra was reading my mind, because seconds later she was pushing her bangs out of her hair and ushering her into the bathroom to help her detangle that birds nest. 

It was still a bit unclear what exactly this customer wanted sexually from her, seeing as she clearly was into men. Sandra was completely naked and I wondered if they had already engaged in anything sexual.  I spotted the crack pipe and that answered a few questions for me. 

“Yeah I Just like didn’t wanna be alone tonight, I usually call girls and they take to long to show up, and I cancel. but you guys were 15 minutes away so I was kind of forced to face my fears tonight” Haste gets you paid, bitch!

“Wanna go in the other room?” she asked. Sure! I wanted to check out more of the house, and I’m just naturally a nosy motherfucker with very little fear in my heart. I mean he could be leading us into a sex dungeon where he’d chloroform us and sodomize us, but if it means I get a peek into this mans life, I’m totally down for the risk.

We enter the bedroom, a delightfully tacky 80s inspired Scarface replica of a room. It’s surprisingly masculine, the mandated flat screen on the wall, xbox on the floor with DVDs scattered everywhere. This is every mans room ever until he gets married and is forced to purchase an entertainment center where his wife will organize everything alphabetically and shun him if he plays for longer than 20 minutes. She makes a beeline for the bed and lays down, hiding behind her phone and becoming extremely introverted.

Sandra happily makes use of the floor to ceiling mirrors covering the south wall. Taking nude selfies and exclaiming interesting remarks such as “Bitch my man gone LOVE this” and “My pussy doesn’t look so black in this pic! Use it for the ad!” 

Rachel mentioned something about kicking out the previous male escort for not paying enough attention to her, so I glared at Sandra and internally chastised her for not interacting with the client. Do I have to teach these girls the entire game? I picked up the slack temporarily and engaged her in somewhat probing conversation. Do you like girls? Why hire a female escort? Have you ever had a boyfriend? Do you feel more comfortable as a female? What else are you on besides crack, because your behavior is fucking INSANE. Ok not the last one. But I damn sure asked her that in my head.

The replies were typical but interesting. Its akin to asking what lesbians “do” for sex. Everyone knows they eat each others pussies and possibly scissor, yet this question is relentlessly asked in spite of that.

She informed me she never had a boyfriend, but desperately wanted one. She had just broken up with her girlfriend of 7 years and was relatively unaffected by this life change. I imagine I would be too, seeing as that relationship must have been severely lacking in the “I need penis” department. As she continued on, my heart started to break for her a little bit. Although she nonchalantly muttered everything, I could tell she felt completely alienated and self-loathing within her body. I wanted to impart some of my “I don’t give a fuck” attitude within her in the short time I had, because I too was once scared to be who I was and love who I wanted in high school. At 27 though, I’d happily eat my wife’s vagina in broad daylight on a crowded beach if it wasn’t illegal.

About midway into the conversation, she sat straight up and asked if I minded her taking a hit of her crack pipe. Alas, of course I didn’t. This was a judgement free zone, and you can’t get second hand high off crack like you can with weed. At least that’s what I’m assuming.. I refuse to google fact check this though. She describes the taste as “A warm delicious silky mouthful of cum” and invites me to take a hit. I would have declined either way, but describing something as tasting like “a mouthful of cum” doesn’t exactly get my gears going. Sandra also intervenes, screaming “my sister isn’t smoking any mothafuckin crack!”. This sparked a very interesting and informative debate on why crack isn’t so bad after all! Persuasion efforts aside, I’ll take my cocaine in the form you can blow up your nose. I’d like to at least have crack be the one drug I never tried when they lay me down in my casket. 

After the hit of crack, she proceeded to choose random techno songs to get the party going. Not sure if her wig or taste in music was worse, but I secretly had already grown a soft spot for Rachel, so I pretended to enjoy the iPhone music soiree. Between the music and drugs, she had gained enough confidence to inject some interesting ad libs randomly into the conversation, some of my favorites include (but are not limited to)

“I just want a bunch of dicks squirting on my face at once”
“Can you pimp me out too? Seriously I’ll be your bitch this weekend you can have all the money”
“I want a fat cock to spray in my ass but its totally not worth the risk” (She hit her crack pipe again right after this statement, and I think she was blissfully unaware of the obvious irony)

She then decided that she wanted Sandra to do her makeup so she could improve the chances of her landing some random cock that night. She happily obliged, and off they went into the carpeted bathroom, 8 minutes later emerging looking like she had been playing outside in the mud. I mean seriously, Sandra overdid the bronzer. Did she take a hit of crack when I wasn’t looking? Questions for the car ride home. Either way, Rachel was ecstatic and ready to update her Grindr profile picture. I wanted to intervene, but fuck it. I also wanted to watch this whole thing play out.

After an hour of playing dress up, it was time to rebill for another hour or get out of there. On occasion, a customer and my girl will hit it off so well that they will talk for the entire hour, time slipping away as they naturally get to know each other. This doesn’t mean they don’t have to pay for consecutive hours, but it puts me in that weird position where I can either press them to pay, or give them a short extension to get the fucking part done. On this occasion, I was tired, but nonetheless entertained. 

“We’ve been here quite a bit, what’s it gonna be hun? I know you aren’t paying 200$ for us to comb your hair. What did you really expect out of this?”

She looked down at the floor shyly and pointed to a cardboard box across the room.

“There’s stuff I like to play with in there” she mumbled. “But you don’t have to-”

“Nonsense!” I exclaimed. I knew Sandra’s favorite clients we’re the ones she could peg. We gave each other a glance, and I walked over to the box to examine its contents. I can’t say I was knocked off my feet surprised, but holy FUCK. I can’t say I was expecting a pitch black horse cock either. Yes, I took pictures of it of course, I’ll upload them in the comments.

Before I could bend over to examine the toy, we heard a groaning sound coming from behind us. Rachel was bent over on the bed, naked and stroking herself, deeply inhaling some poppers while she loudly yelled raunchy lines. 

“YOU SEE MY BIG FUCKING HORSE COCK? SHOVE IT THE FUCK IN ME MMM TELL YOUR DRIVER TO GET OUT IM GONNA BURST ALL OVER THIS FUCKING DUVET”

We tried our absolute best to maintain professionalism, but I know we wanted to keel over and die of laughter. This would have to wait until the car though. I gathered my things and bid them farewell, shooting Sandra a sly grin on my way out. 

“Bye bitch!” she said as she slammed the door. I didn’t even make it to steps before I heard that all too familiar scream of a man ejaculating, and about 4 minutes later she enters the car with a huge smile on her face.

“What, was it that much fun?” I said, both exhaustedly and sarcastically.

“BITCH SHE PAID FOR 2 HOURS!” as she slams 400 dollars on to my dashboard.

That’s my girl. 

TLDR: Am a madam, got a call from a client who turned out to be trans. My girl fucked him with his fake horse penis and we made 400$

I have ab 800-1000mg of hydrocodone, maybe 500mg of IR oxycodone (roxy 10s, but still - no tylenol), and then like 1150mg of OP/extended release OxyContin 

This stash is all from pharmacies from a trusted situation involving no endangerment to others or anything like that - the roxys were a ripoff obviously. But for 2017 in my area, everything else was a fairly reasonable price

Now I can be blitzed for the next week or so (hopefully longer but yknow... best laid plans and everything) and not have to worry ab driving w anything, having it on me in public etc. also to spot friends if supply is running a bit dry

It sucks for prices but every time I use out of this batch, I will know exactly what I'm doing and not have to worry in any way whatsoever about falling out/dying from a fent hotspot through the windows

it was this side effect that first got me experimenting with  opiates, and sure enough, after my first Tramadol Dose, no matter how much porn I watched I just could not cum. then i finally had sex on it and she thoughts i was a sex God, and she would cum way before I did - which usually is never ever the case -- 5 mins max for me. on opiates , up to 60mins and sometimes never at all.

in addition to this, since the libido is removed, it means that instead of being the rabid animal always on the prowl for push, again, is severely lessened. 

 Now I must admit, I can be quite misogynistic at times, I find myself incompatible with females but my strong drive always would prevails. and so I was stuck in this trap of hating women, but thinking with my dick. 

now as much of a pain in the ass an opiate habbit can be - I really really enjoy this removal of link do? because it allows me have a conversation with a girl without fantasising about fucking her

in other words i can talk to them like i can with my male friends. I see them as humans and just objects to be fucked.

the only downside is that opiates tick every box inn life, meaning I'd rather have junk over food., junk over clothes, junk over a job and  as mentioned junk over women.

Heroin really does, and can replace that missing void, of which most stable non addicts fill the void with women.

how do you guys feel about the libido effects?

do you also choose opiates over sex and abgirlfriend ?

lastly: most heroin addicts are skinny and gaunt a of which I am not, I'm 18bs at 5'9.

are the skinny skeleton people like that because rheir habits are so big that they're appetite is superstars to such a degree that they eat very rarely?

case in point: 
*Chris Farley, morphine overdose
*John belushi, morphine overdose
a*Phillip Seymour, Heroin overdose.'

^^ all overweight and 2 of them clinically obese 

maybe it's the poor heroin addicts that can't afford both food and their habbit, whereas these megastars clould afford buffets from room service.

**tldr** do you enjoy the loss of libido if you're like me who's life was controlled by pussy and never got it - and now you could have a supermodel walk in to my room and beg sex but I'll choose the Heroin any day.",1488651810.0

I've used prescription opiates on and off for about 10 years. It all started with a dreaded surgery that turned into 10 surgeries. Started at 15 and unfortunately it has never fully stopped. It has ranged from oxycodone, dilaudid, hydrocodone, and at one point morphine. For the last year it has strictly been hydrocodone, moved from Colorado to Texas and they don't prescribe anything better than hydrocodone in the town I'm in unless you're terminal it seems. I no longer have a medical need for them, and I have found that my energy levels are 0 without some form of opiate in my system. My tolerance is fairly low, 30mg of hydrocodone gets me on my feet, so I'm wondering if kratom will help keep my energy up and how much I should start with. I am 5'2 and 140lbs if that matters.

I was sober for a year after a 2-ish year dance with oxy. Was feeling awesome and looking good. THen Norcos fell into my lap, but I wasn't satisfied. My love is oxy. 3 months after those NOrcos fell in my lap, a steady supply of free oxy IR 20mg have been in my possession since like September last year. Of course, I got addicted again, but it took a few months to notice since I had developed a healthy lifestyle during my last sobriety period of that year. Anyway, I was away from home for about 2 weeks in December in which I set up a scenario where I would definitely run out. I was clean for 6 long days, barely eating, then got home in the first week of January and was back at it again at the drop of a dime. Just been feeling like an animal, at about 75-110mg a day of oxy, mostly rectally administered, and I've developed a pale complexion with dark circles under the eyes, sudden hair loss that forced me to shorten my beautiful curly hair, an unmovable affect of mostly stale smiles and rudeness and loss of muscle tone, and most devastatingly, no motivation in the morning to move forward or eat which forces me to use ASAP.

You guys know the drill. I've never been able to stop when I have oxy in my possession, but I still have some and didn't dose after 5pm, which is rare. Instead, I've gone to the gym three times (!!) today, doing as hard of cardio as possible and have been coming out feeling better and better, all in the span of a day, which is a blink of the eye in trying to achieve sobriety. However, my run has only been since September this time, instead of years upon years. In my 6 day reprieve mentioned above, I mostly just had a slow leak of sweat from the armpits and ass. I'm thinking that might be on the menu again, along with lethargy and inner urge to medicate (throw it) all away with about a 40mg oxy dose in the rectum. I'm going to try to come here for support, I really need to get clean. The mental toll on me has just been excruciating, and I feel like time is just passing me by. Help!",1488790826.0

5xqpdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5xqpdh/drugstore_detour/,24,https://redd.it/5xqpdh,brentacle,Drugstore Detour,"The phone vibrates in Brian’s lap and, taking his hand off the wheel, he reaches for it only to knock it unceremoniously between the center console and the driver’s seat, where he sat in the late model gold Toyota on his way to pick up his roommate from work.


“Fuck my life,” Brian mumbles under his breath, wiping the cold snot lining his nostrils across the arm of the long-sleeved shirt he’s been wearing for the past three days. Actually, who can count? He may well have been wearing it the whole week.
He reaches down to the power cord plugged into the cigarette lighter, wanting to fish the slippery phone out from no-hands’ land and, attempting to stifle a sneeze, pulls the plug right out from the back of the phone which falls back into the abyss with a taunting “cli-clack”.


The decoupling causes a sudden give in the taught cable and sends him into a rage. He pulls the plug out of the dash and proceeds to whip himself on his bare calf with the cable.


“Awrrghhh,” he whines, rearing back with the cable to strike himself again.


“Yea, take it bitch,” he commands of himself, a slight smile appearing just above what might have been a five o’clock shadow at five o’clock some four days ago.


“It hurts so good, doesn’t it? You fucking weirdo.”


His legs, previous poster-children of restless leg syndrome, temporarily stop their rapid shaking as he rubs the red strip slowly rising up in his pale skin. He grabs some of the ginger hair that keeps his legs from being mistaken for exsanguinated corpse flesh and twists it hard one time before rearing back with the green USB cable. He bears down with the cable again, harder this time and lets out a yelp, seemingly of pain, but the look on his face, that silly crooked smile of someone who is truly losing it, says otherwise. The hierarchy of pain is an odd thing, but Brian has learned to take advantage of it during these times of withdrawal.


“Moments ago I hurt everywhere. Now I just hurt right here,” he thinks to himself, rubbing the red strip of raised flesh, trying to convince himself that he’s not some masochistic lunatic.


These symptoms happen whenever Brian goes more than 24 hours without his almighty cure-all, his heroine: heroin. He’s already spent all the money that he so slickly conned out of his aunt on his insatiable habit and is now rushing to pick up his roommate, the wonderful Sandra, who very well may want to send him on a sketchy mission to procure more of the holy substance. She would undoubtedly share with him, just as he had with her. To be quite honest though, she’s carried much more of the burden in this relationship than he. This fact makes him want to escape from the reality of it all the more.


He hits the cruise control, pulls forward on the seat belt and, like a contortionist, reaches his hand around the back of and underneath the driver’s seat, retrieving the elusive phone with his finger tips. He pulls it into view, corrects the course of the vehicle with his knee on the wheel, narrowly missing the back end of an 18-wheeler, and reads the offending message from Sandra: “I’ve got an emergency faculty meeting and won’t need you to pick me up for at least another hour. Why don't you go pick up new points at the pharmacy? We’ll get well after I get off.”


“Son of a bitch,” Brian whines, thinking about the eternity that another hour of this torture will feel like. He thinks about the difficulty of picking up new insulin syringes, what Sandra referred to as “points.”


This requires him to walk up to the pharmacy counter and act like a straight, up-standing citizen who suffers from diabetes, a simple enough task under normal circumstances, but far more difficult when sweating profusely and actively experiencing the paradoxical relief of the inflicted pain of USB cables and mini-Indian burns.


Brian would very much like both to “get off” and to “get well,” however, so he plugs “Walgreen's” into the phone to receive GPS directions to the nearest one. There is one just two blocks further down from where he was heading already, passed Sandra’s work. He starts taking deeper breathes, trying to calm down, and takes some Axe body spray out of the center console. He sprays himself across the chest and under his arms, hoping that the clean smell will deter any upstanding citizen from seeing the truth of his deplorable circumstances.


The sudden smell tickles his nose and sends him into another sneezing spell. To sneeze eight times in a row and not crash the car is no small feat, but his pride is short-lived as a cramping pain in his bowels causes him to almost double over in his seat. A sound like a bubbling oil pool emanates from and rumbles his whole torso. He scantly wishes for death, an end to all this needless, self-induced suffering. He slams on the brakes, noticing the light ahead is red, but he slides too far into the intersection. He sees the flash of the red light cameras snapping a picture of the license plate.


“God dammit! Sandra is going to kill me,” Brian said aloud. The car he’s driving is Sandra’s and she would be responsible for that ticket. He has already got her a ticket once before.


“I am the worst friend ever. I really think people would be better off if I were dead.”
The light turns green and Brian pulls forward and into the Walgreen's. He gets out of the car and into the store, walking towards the pharmacy. He tries to go into the men’s room but the door is locked. He bumps into a lanky man of about six feet with a large black trench coat on in spite of the extreme heat outside. He shoves Brian a little bit forward, saying “Watch it, ass hole.”


Brian, needing more than anything to empty his bowels, calls out “Sorry,” as he passes by him en-route to the counter waving a hand up in apology without looking back. He asks the pharmacist quickly for the keys to the bathroom, trying not to look as desperate as he truly was. The long-haired Indian woman with a ruby bindi in her third-eye smiles and reaches into her lab coat pocket and shifts around inside. She pulls out the keys and slides them jingling across the counter toward Brian’s outstretched, grateful hands. 

He thanks her and quickly makes his way into the restroom. He has no time to be concerned with putting the sanitary covers over the seat and, only slightly grossed out, drops his trousers and sits immediately on the unsuspecting toilet. He lets out a small wail of simultaneous pain and relief in accompaniment to the sound of a bucket splashing into a lake which emanates up from between and beneath his legs.
He sits there, almost out of breath, but feeling very relieved. He hears two loud banging noises through the bathroom door. “Someone’s shitty car must be back-firing in the parking lot,” he thinks to himself. He takes another few minutes on the commode to ensure the anal onslaught is over, and satisfied that it is, cleans himself up, washes his hands and face in the sink and dries up in the ridiculous blower attached to the wall, its jet engine drowning everything out, and echoing all over the tile bathroom.
He turns back to find where he set the keys to the bathroom and heads out to the pharmacy counter, ready at last to try and social engineer his way to some new points. 


He opens the door and makes his way to the counter.


“Holy shit,” Brian thinks to himself as he notices the cash register lying on its side at the foot of the counter. Bottles lay all around it and a large metal cabinet, usually locked until the pharmacist accesses its contents, lays open at a 45 degree angle tipped over the counter. He looks around but there is not a single worker in sight. He rushes over and notices that all the bottles strewn across the counter and floor are controlled substances: narcotics!


“Holy shit! Don’t mind if I do,” he says to himself, grabbing a shopping bag and filling it with all of the bottles he could grab. Oxycontin, roxicodone, meperidine, demerol, dilaudid, morphine, methadone, some fentanyl transdermal patches, and a few other things that even his street pharmacist brain had never heard of were all thrown in the bag.


Just when he was finishing up looting all the bottles on his side of counter, he leans over to see if he missed anything. On the floor just on the other side lay the long-haired Indian pharmacist, breathing shallowly and holding a wound on her neck, blood pouring out between her fingers. Brian immediately loops the pharmacopoeia over his sweaty, bony shoulders and jumps over the counter, grabs a spare lab coat hanging nearby and rushes to the pharmacist, immediately applying pressure with the coat. It quickly soaks through with the blood spewing from her neck. Her eyes look glossy and are wide with terror as she squeezes on Brian’s bicep as though she believes that if she could just hold on to this sickly junkie, the rushing darkness would not overcome her. All would be well and she could be tricked by Brian into selling him the works he came for.


Brian quickly ascertains that this poor woman is lost to the world. Should he hold on with her till the bitter end, or should he break away with enough drugs to sate his thirst for at least a month? As he makes his decision a rookie police officer rushes into the pharmacy, his Glock 9mm pistol drawn. He sees the woman bleeding out, clutching at Brian’s arm, as he lurks over her, holding her neck with a bag full of stolen drugs slung over his shoulder. He fires a single shot straight into the back of Brian’s head. Brian’s face explodes into the Indian pharmacist’s dead eyes, her bindi lost in the dots of scarlet spraying her face.

I hope I am posting this in the correct place. Forgive if I am not and I hope someone can point me in the right direction.

I had shoulder surgery in 2014. At first, I was prescribed oxycidone and eventually my doctor dropped it to hydrocodone. My doseages have gone up, but I would say that I have been taking 45-50 mg of hydrocodone a day for quite a while. 

Anyhow, the surgery wasn't too successful and I was sent out to a specialist with a recommendation for a total shoulder replacement. Well, there is a period between now and then when I will not be prescribed a script until the new doctor sees me.

I have been/am kind of worried about possible withdrawals from being in then for so long. However, I am 4 days without any hydrocodone and I don't feel any type of withdrawals or symptoms. 

Is it possible to not have any withdrawals with that kind of usage?  Can I expect the withdrawals to hit me any time soon? I am still pretty worried. I have read horror stories about usage and withdrawals.

Thank you in advance for all of your responses, advice and help.",1488761711.0

So about a week agoooo...

 Or two, I went to cop right? 
Well boys in jail so grab what I can from his girl. Grab a gram of street ready, a half of raw. But wait. They're gonna throw in a extra free sack. OK cool. 

I hope in the car to get shit ready while my man is waiting for that other sack. I was kinda panicking that this wouldn't be enough until tomorrow when we could pick up our usual half piece. 
So I get out run down to homeboy who's a few doors down. 

OK. Cool has a phone number for us. So run back down to tell my bf. 

Well some kid was leaving home boys and he took off so fast. Even left his cigarettes. 

Go back to the car to get our stuff and walk to home boys to smoke and talk. 

Full panic sets in. I don't remember where I left that g. Cannot find it. End up tearing the car apart and walking back and forth.
Figure it's gone and that one dude found it and left. Why else would he be out of there so quick?..

Well whatever chalk it up as a loss. Grab a ball from homeboy and leave. 

Well the next day, while waiting for plug, we're out and starting to hurt. 
So let's go hit up homeboy or dudes girl and see if they have something. 

Neither is there so we think.. ""fuck it can't hurt too look.""

Just as we are about to give up.... 

Bf looks in a puddle and THERE IT IS. unharmed and unphased. 
Nobody noticed it. And I think it got ran over. It must have fell out when I opened the door. 

I have shit short term memory. So I just couldn't remember where I put it. I figured I could sniff it out when I got sick. 
Idk about you guys but I have some super junkie nose when I'm hurting. 


You don't know how happy I was. He gave me soooo much shit about it and how it was a waste and blah blah bitch bitch. Lmao


Tl;dr: lost a g of dope. Figured some kid found it and took off. Went back the next day. Found the sack in a puddle. Unharmed.

Hi,

I've been using Oxy for about a year and a half. I've never been physically addicted and my pattern of use is that I'll get 70mg of oxy once or month or so and use it over about a week, then not use any for about 3 weeks. I'll typically take 20-30mg and tolerance has not increased beyond that. I live abroad so can only get oxy when I return to the UK. I'll sometimes bring 3 or 4 pills back with me but otherwise have no access when I'm abroad.

I think at this point I'm psychologically addicted to Oxy, I think about it every day and do think a lot about the next time I will be able to experience the blissful high. When I go home to the UK, more than anything I'm looking forward to taking Oxy. So yeah, it's pretty obvious I'm psychologically addicted. But I'm extremely fearful of physical addiction which is why I've gone 1.5 years using without ever becoming physically addicted. However I've researched this a LOT and know that it took many people many years to succumb to outright addiction with opiates. So I'm not arrogant enough to believe it can't happen to me.

I like Oxy. The thought of not using it at all makes me kind of sad. I'm in a good place in life in terms of circumstances, finances, job, physical health, relationships, etc but am prone to the ennui/depression that affects a lot of people. I've got a history of depression, anxiety, OCD, etc. I often find it hard to completely relax, after period of sobriety get this creeping boredom and dissatisfaction, etc.

Based on the above, what do you think? Can I continue to enjoy Oxy once a month or so or should I run a mile? I have to say that although the amount of use hasn't changed over 1.5 years I'm thinking about it more than I used to and think maybe I'm experiencing that insidious reshaping of my reward system.

Thanks a million in anticipation of any advice!

In my 30's, female living in the sticks. 

It all started in 2007 or sometime around there. 

Had a pain in my side, turned out it was gallstones. My first prescription. T3's. Hello, feels! 

I was off and on them until 2009 when I 'graduated' to perc's. The ones with the 0636 on one side and blank on the other. 

What a feeling! 

Had my surgery in 09. Pills, pills and more pills. With the occasional shot or morphine. 

After weighing about 170 pounds my birthday of 08 to roughly 95-100 pounds of summer 09, I knew not only did I have a problem. I had a sickness. 

The weight loss was ah-fucking-mazing! 
My boobs were HUGE & my waist was small! I never felt 'better' 

A few months after that, my legal way of obtaining the pills was no longer so I didn't have a choice but to stop. 

I was good for maybe 1-2 years. I was missing something. The daily things I did sober were bothersome. 

I've had migraines since I was young. I knew I had to see a Dr about it. They were becoming frequent and damn painful! 

The nice Dr wrote out Imitrex nasal spray and T3's. 

I was good in the beginning. Only took them when I needed and pretty much tried to forget they were there. 

Well, that didn't last long. It was calling me. I acknowledged. 

Daily routine included waking up, pills maybe some food and then more pills. 

It started again. 

Had a surgery that required me to have more pain killers. I was in heaven. Was still only taking T3's as I knew if I did more then I'd change to something different and then run out again. 

Sometime went by and it ran out. 

Idea!! 

Go see the Dr. Migraines. Script. Score! 

Another surgery. 

Ask for stronger meds, get them and then end up with an infection from surgery. 
On IV antibiotics for 2 weeks. IV stayed in and morphine was always administered. 

That feeling when it first goes into the IV line. Warm. Lifting. 

Fast forward to now. 

Have bile duct issues from gallstones and pretty much eating like shit and back to 170 pounds. 

In and out of the hospital and ER. Not cool. 

I'm able to get buscopan and toradol. T3's of anything of the sort? Nope. Well, shit. 

Spoke with the Dr at an appt. Was told I am not getting anymore meds. They think I'm selling it. 
HA! Hell no! That's for me! 

They didn't believe me and thought I was going to yell, scream and get mad at them for not giving me what I wanted. 

Why? Just to dig a deeper hole? Heck no! I need to be nice with them even though I don't want to be. 

So, here I am. Writing out my 'story' to the community with a throw away. Aggravated and ready to go nuts. 

I've tried looking around for some. No avail. 

I guess after I'm done writing this, my chapter with using opiates is closed until further notice. 

No! I don't want to use anything harder than opiates. That shit is scary. I have an addictive personality and I know once I try it, you might as well write me off.

So  I just posted in another thread about some funny rehab stories I just remembered because I'm on a lot of Adderall it's fun to write about it so everybody share your funny rehab stories.  I'll start off with what I posted in the other thread about everybody was fucking in rehab, including the nasty overweight 50yr old women and  this one married guy was trying to get in on the action.  He also was like 50 years old and he took off his wedding band to look like he was single and Sure enough the dumb motherfucker lost the thing and was begging people for the next two weeks to help and look for it and he must've scoured every square foot of that facility.

 Also another good one was seeing the faces of parents who just dropped off their piece of shit addict child as they drove away in their car.  at least two different couples you could hear audibly cheering and happy as all hell that they finally had a month to themselves without having to worry about some dip shit junkie fucking things up for a few weeks

And for some reason all the white guys that smoke crack with only refer to it as freebase and when someone asked what freebase was instead of just saying yeah I'm a crackhead they would make it sound extremely luxurious like ""freebase is the most potent and pure form of cocaine anyone could ever produce on the market"" it was only the white guys, the two black dudes were just straight up ""yea I smoke rock."".  This one crackhead, white trashy as fuck and had no shame was hilarious, the dude would tell stories about chopping off his girlfriends toes with garden shears for smoking his last rock and how he needed to masturbate like at least a dozen times a day in there.  I def saw cum on the shower floors and on the fucking toilet seat (wtf seriously) people were horny as shit

 Best quote from rehab was the same guy when asked what was the most important thing in your life that you lost due to your addiction and people are saying family, friends, spouses, their house, their children etc.  this motherfucker without batting an eye and with a dead serious tone just said ""my zero turn lawnmower""",1488881159.0

Let's all try and stand together help each other rise and grow together than focusing on the negatives of life/relationships.

I'm a long time lurker, but without you all I don't know if I would be alive right now as no one else in my life nows what I'm going through as an opioid dependent patient.  

Much love, peace, and happiness (and nods) to you all

No dilaudid rush but way better than sublingual or snorting, very nice glow sets in after a few sec.  To enhance the euphoria from this I have mixed Adderall with it in the same IV daily as I get both scripted.  People talk shit about both bupe and addy IV and by themselves they are pleasant for sure but together they realllllly mix well.

I shoot around 2-3mg bupe and will mix anywhere from 30-100mg of addy.  One certain brand of generic Xr 30s have beads that barely gel at all which are my preferred ones, but I occasionally will use my generic pink 20s.  If I just tilt the spoon while it soaks the shot pulls up super clear but pinkish tinted and I get back 90% of the units I put in.  I draw the bupe up in around 50units of water and squirt that Onto the addy and come back with around 45 units.

Once u get up to around 75mg or so the addy really starts to shine and will make you puke, but lower doses still work great too.  Anybody else with me?  Just did a 2mg bupe plus 20mg addy for like the 5th time today because I got new rigs and they're very fun to use when you've been stuck with two old used rigs for the past month",1488871633.0

And it was not thanks to heroin, no siree! I can thank heroin for delaying a lot of the symptoms of my mental illness and probably not offing myself by now, but that's about it. Oh and I guess the few people I've met I've happened to really like. Actually, you can probably thank a LACK of heroin for my day 5 awake ramblings that used to fill this sub (which come on, is not too hard to do).

Oh, and I guess thank you heroin for making it impossible to remember my passwords, causing me to have to keep starting new accounts and think up new usernames. Man, you guys, if I had the same account this whole time, I would have sooo much karma :( ! I'm also almost 88% sure I posted a little nudie here when I think I was at last 18 with some drugs, when that had just started becoming a thing. Yeah, sounds like something I would do hahaha man. I wonder if it's still up. Fuck! Focusing.

I was generally active on this sub for awhile while I was a teenager waiting til I could finally could get dope, although there's not much to say until you fuck up your life and start really using lol. I moved for college to a great state on the border with plentiful cheap dope and meth (that one I didn't see coming) and...no needle exchange program of course. So my heroin addiction began immediately and smoothly as planned. 

I also slowly did more and more meth over the next 3 semesters, and the only time I'd fuck around actually typing anything was when I was on meth and alone...and then oh boy would I type! Holy shit. Like, Reddit finally telling me there's no more room to type anymore, and I realize right as I click send for the 100th time that hour that I can't even remember the first half of the novel I'm plopping like a fat stinking shit in some poor person's innocent, unsuspecting inbox. Some random dude who probably just left 2 sentences in the comments of a great post about some great junkie shit and had already forgotten about it completely. Why did I even start writing and what about?? Who knows, I didn't want to have to go back and read that shit! I know at least some of y'all know what I'm talking about. And any ""oldtimers"" here definitely read at least something I wrote at some point and more than likely also PMed some too. So...there...

I was around enough that someone actually made a post asking if anyone knew what was up with me, because I hadn't posted anything in awhile (which couldn't have been much longer than a week). I'm positive I just didn't have meth for a bit. I wish I could find that person in real life and just give them the biggest hug, though, because opening up Reddit to find such a loving and caring act by a user I did not even know or interact with as far as I can remember was an amazing feeling, and I'm positive that one act will continue to stay with me for the rest of my life. I mean, shit, I've never done that for anyone here. Thank you meth! Those little acts are actually pretty big acts. Dude had more of a positive effect on my life than my entire family combined haha. If I just made you feel bad for yourself by showing off how awesome I obviously am because someone once cared about me for a minute, I'm a selfish asshole but I'm not sorry. Suck it, with love my good friend.

And then I basically and abruptly quit Reddit activity completely, especially r/opiates, for a long time. Why? Do you care? Do I care if you don't care? Did I stop doing heroin? Eventually yeah, I gave that a try, but no, I moved to a city in one of those states with literally no meth (and even if I went through the trouble to find it and by some miracle actually succeeded, it would've been so expensive and possibly rock candy etc etc you guys know the drill; it's just pointless and I have never cared enough about meth from the beginning). I continued and escalated my heroin addiction, but never even visited or did anything on this sub until recently, like today, when I finally got to meth binge again! Once again, I find myself alone and tweaking hard. It's just ironic and well, you know...I gotta tell someone. If someone is even still on this sub you fucking lazy junkies! 

Man, I always regret doing meth at some point, every time lol, but thank you dark web + person who knows how to use it. This was fun and I needed this (debatable, but yes). And thank you r/opiates. Despite the Tetris of walls of texts and tangents I constantly rained down upon you as my meth addiction slowly grew up and fucked me sideways (when I wasn't crazy cleaning or staring at my pupils in the mirror for 3 hours), I have no memory of being treated anything but kindly. 

I think I'm actually going to sleep though now and only stay up for not even two days straight, so I'm afraid the fucking monster text posts, comments, and messages I put you guys through shall so far remain in the past. Who cares? I don't know, but it's too much fun conversing in any way on g, and I already spammed the fuck out of r/raisedbynarcissists all day about my mommy issues, and I decided I missed you assholes. One old giant tweaker post for the good old days, sent flying into the nothingness abyss that is this sub and ignored by literally 99.99992% of humanity, so I know it doesn't really matter. That two matters.

Also Idk what happened, maybe it's just because of drugs plus time, but I feel like this sub has changed a lot. Are there just some more general assholes? Or is it the same number, but just less decent people and good people, like the kind who posts a check in post like a fucking saint? Less personal PMs happening? Less activity period...? And yes, I guess now I'm that asshole. When I relapsed and came back, I actually posted here in the first time in awhile, but I ended up pussying out and deleting it within 24 hours due to the comments. From my perspective it seemed some people really just didn't understand some light sarcasm and/or just needed to feel better than someone. It made me sad. If you've ever deleted a post you know what I'm talking about.

It makes sense that a sub for junkies is small and not super active, considering I literally don't even touch this sub when I'm just doing good ole heroin, but I don't know. Can anyone who was here in 2013-2014 and stuck around at all please tell me what's up? Ha who am I talking to. Just in case, though. You never know. You also never know when you're just crazy. Ok most people do but I don't.

Anyways...I need y'all to step up and be more active on this sub. Do some meth people, Jesus! There's a good chance I won't be back for awhile anyways which I know matters because I'm #1, but due to that important information I'd like to request you guys start doing what I'm not willing to do, so I can lurk and then also actually have some motherfuckers to spam with walls of texts in case I go on another meth binge once again eventually. Cool? Cool.

See, why the Fuck did I type out all this shit? The title already said everything, already made my point. If you can even call it a ""point."" Man, doing this is bringing me back, what a trip. Like clockwork, I'm now just thinking/obsessing over if I should edit this post, deleting most of it, or maybe just discard the whole thing. But I just can't. Well, obviously I'm physically able to hit discard, seeing as I'm continuing to hit all the other little buttons to continue to type completely aimlessly, so I suppose I should rephrase that: 

I don't want to fucking discard it! I typed out all this shit, I even proofread it, I used paragraph spaces and motherfucking commas and shit, I even got a good ole semicolon up in this bitch...and I even had a good time while doing it! And I ain't hurting anyone! And that's not how you Reddit when you've been up for awhile tweaking on meth. You always hit send. What's the point otherwise? Are you seriously still reading? Holy shit thank you, you are probably pretty bored, but definitely a cool person I can and will say with the utmost confidence. I hope the best for you in life. 

Oh shit, I should probably read through this all one last time. I don't normally do this, but I gotta. Especially because first of all, I ain't deleting shit as previously referenced to, but then I had to go making big claims that I'm all grammatically and hitting-enter-twice-at-the-appropriate-intervals correct. I'll be back.

Ok so I've proofread this I think like 10 times now, but every time then I just end up adding more, so then I've had to go back to proofread THAT and so now here you go guys: you didn't ask for it and don't want it and won't read it, but this sub now has a good ole meth rant. Organic, fresh, straight from the vine in my tweaking brain. I hope the question above me gets answered with no arguments, the picture of dope that I do not have below me is some fire shit, and I hope the post, like, 3 or 4 posts up that's actually getting upvoted and commented on because it's complaining about people exhibiting disturbing signs that they are not as good of a junkie as you gets at least 1 person to reach a full orgasm. Preferably a real hardcore user that hasn't managed to do that in awhile because yay opiates, and you know because of that they're the best junkie and really deserve a good cum too. I mean, as long as someone cums. Just saying, God, if you're totally listening, let the best junkie cum.

I had a good time for awhile. Its nice to have a somewhat harmless outlet. Ok I'm seriously sending. Thank you I love you guys.",1488864330.0

At day 9 I was still feeling like ass and was restless as hell.....no surprise obviously. So I took I big ass 3 gram dose of phenibut and felt much better all day, I slept more than 2 hours straight without waking up sick for the first time. However, the next day my symptoms seemed worse than before the Phenibut......more like they were on day 6. So approximately a 3 day set back subjectively..I wrote it off as the fickleness that is WD and how it varies day to day after the initial ass raping. So yesterday I felt pretty much ""normal"" physically, I decided to take a 2 gram dose of Phenibut, it was ok. Today I have the eye watering, the sneezing, the yawning, the crawly skin. Not real WD at all, but the mild signs have noticeably returned. Google it and saw some science papers on how GABA-B (baclofen) and opiate WD are intimately related in complicated science ways. New research they are using the GABA-B agonist Baclofen to lessen certain symptoms in severe opiate WD. I'm curious as to wether anyone has experienced reemerging WD with GABA-B agonists like GHB, GHB analogues, Baclofen, or Phenibut/F-Phenibut. ",1488863183.0

But this morning the original place called me and said he has a meeting and he's gonna try to get me in. I didn't really believe anything would happen cause heard this before.

The morphine was in a pill bottle inside a strange backpack I had never seen before. Conveniently, under the backpack was a towel and a bag full of bathroom supplies. Under that bag was a few jackets, shirts, and pants. 

Sure enough, the sketchy kid my sister has been hanging out with got kicked out of his house and has been sleeping in her room. SHOWERING IN MY FUCKIN SHOWER



**Well, thanks for the Fent n Morphine loser. The rest of your shits on the porch :)**

**EDIT:**

Since a lot of you did not agree with what I did in the story i shared earlier, heres a little more info that may change your mind.

So the kid who was bumming it at our house without me or my parents knowledge, was the same one who my parents bailed out of jail about a year and a half ago. They paid 300$ out of pocket(alot to us at time, really) for bail because his parents had done it one too many times and refused to pay it, and my sister was with him when they got pulled over for HIS driving.

he promised on everything he would not only do what he needed to and show up to this court dates, but also pay them back once he got a job. Well to this day he still owes them that 300$ back and ditched all his court dates, my parents are constantly contacted from bounty hunters looking for him. My sister had told us months ago he had moved away'

So judge me all you want, **BUT I WASNT GONNA LET THIS IDIOT RUIN MY SISTERS LIFE THE SAME WAY I DID MY OWN WITH OPIATES, AND LIVE IN MY HOUSE WHILE DOING IT.**

And ""what is your favorite thing to do while high?""","Honestly, when I'm in the act of getting high, like prepping and shooting up I want *silence*. Even if I'm listening to music or a podcast or whatever while I'm prepping my shot, I will put that shit on mute or pause it while im finding a vein and pushing down that plunger. I feel like any noise or distraction is just taking away from the rush and I want to enjoy the rush for everything that it is...maybe after I'm sufficiently high I'll turn back on the podcast or whatever I'm listening to, but as I'm coming up I don't wanna hear shit. I don't even want to hear people talk to me. I want you to shut the fuck up so I can enjoy this moment because this is basically the high point of my day (pun may or may not be intended). 

As for my favorite thing *to do* when high? I honestly just like cleaning up my room/house/car/environment/self when I'm high because when I'm sick I'm a lazy whiney piece of shit and I don't want to do a god damn thing, so I take advantage of the fact that I'm high and actually feel good enough to clean up my surroundings (and my body) because when I'm sick again I know I won't do any of it. 

I honestly don't know if there was a point to this post. Like when people ask what's your favorite music while high? I'm like...the same shit I like when I'm not high? It's not like a certain music feels better to listen to. 

 And what's your favorite thing to do high? ...The shit that I'm too sick to do while I'm not high. This includes spending time with friends and...whatever else normal people do. 

Again. No point to my post. Was just thinking about it.

I've seen massive amounts of sub pills being crushed and snorted. Some people mixed it with warm water and put it on their finger and up the nose it went...

And people were saying that it's like a great high... my question is how/why?


I mean, isn't this considered a non narcotic? Doesn't this shit have naloxone specifically to block the brains receptors from getting a high? I mean I know that it's supposed fill your opiate receptors to its full capacity in a sense... but How are these people getting high/buzz/rush from this? 

I've was prescribed subs at one point but only took them here and there and never got anything from it except a big headache. 

Does anyone here fuck with subs as a high and NOT as a Methadone or WD alternative ?

So today I realized that I really take for granted my ability to access needle exchanges locally without being judged, harassed, or generally treated like my fine junkie self. There is a weekly exchange downtown that's literally 2 blocks from my house that is there rain or shine. They give out up to 100 rigs per person a visit as well as small amount of basic supplies like cookers, water, cottons, etc. They ladies at the check in desk are amiable and professional as well as the volunteers, and there is a social worker in the lobby who offers a fast-tapered suboxone program for detoxing. I used to go to that one pretty regularly but between myself and my s/o, a box of 100 cleans usually didn't get us through the week, or we would miss the exchange all together and end up having to buy them, if we had the money. 

I used to go the that one at least 3 times a month until I got word of a mobile exchange that visits a few towns twice a week and is about 20 mins south of me. I was blessed to be able to buy my own cheap car this year, (finally!) so I don't mind the drive because I'm always accompanied by my dboys girl who has become a close friend. Their house goes through a lot of rigs and so do I, so she pays for gas and I drive and it all works out to be a good time. Before we go we gather up all the dirties we can find (don't worry, they're all in sharps bins, Gatorade bottles, or something poke-proof) because most of our friends who use aren't always able to make the exchange. We take the load down south and come back with enough cleans to last a month to 6 weeks for everyone. 

Anyways, my point... 

This exchange is on an old school bus and the lady and dude who run it are addiction councilors and kick ass people who are all about hard reduction. At the one close to my house, your rigs have to be bundled in rubber bands in packs of 10 it's rig for rig up to 100. At the mobile one, you're able to exchange as many as you have (seeing you don't totally clean them out) and they estimate how many you have and usually send you home with a TON more than you brought. This also means no handling dirties by having to bundle them, they give out red sharps bins and you fill those up and bring them back. They also give out BOXES of hand sanitizer, wipes, clean waters, band-aids, tons of cottons and ties as well as narcan if you ask. This place is basically the shit and I seriously don't get why every county isn't funding this shit. Today I personally (my dboys girls not included) took in 5 red sharp collectors as well as a reusable grocery bag full and was send home with... (drumroll plz) 

4 THOUSAND CLEAN RIGS!!! 

SOO( mods tell me if this isn't ok) I wanted to let y'all know that if you have been sticking yourself with the same dull, units rubbed off old rig, STOP PLEASE AND PM ME. And we can try to work something out so I can send you a box or two of cleans. I am a firm believer in harm reduction and that every IV user should have access to a clean rig and clean gear each time they get down. 

Anywhoo, thanks for reading! Enjoy your  night everyone and please don't hesitate to send me a message. I would love to chat with y'all any day because you guys seriously are the shit and always make my day better by reading your posts. Much love to the opi-fam!

To explain briefly, my father committed suicide on Sunday night, a heroin overdose. He wasn't a user either, but my mother had been years and years ago before she passed away, and I think it was just the drug he thought to seek out first. It's a long story and it's irrelevant here, but he's been in the middle of an awful divorce with my stepmother, and had rapidly lost everything. He had a brain injury from 2012 that had ruined his memory and motor skills, and despite that, I watched him build his business up three different times in the last year, only to lose that too.

I think the overdose was an accident, but there's no way to really know, given the circumstances. But all I can see in my mind is him on the floor of that motel room, and I can't imagine at all how he must have felt.

Either way, I understand that these things vary wildly by person and situation, but I'd like to have some better idea of it. I just want to know if he was scared, if he was in pain.

> submitted 2 hours ago by NedenLotus
Let me start by prefacing that I am not a big believer in the paranormal. I do believe in ghosts but I also believe 99.9% of all ""paranormal activity"" is due to other factors be it mental illness or mass hysteria. When my husband and I moved into our house we were all too aware that there was some negative energy there. The past owner was a heavy drug user and things got ugly when he vacated the house. Whatever, that's fine. But within weeks things started going missing. Like, utterly disappearing. Little things at first like a pillow. Just gone. Then my alarm clock. Then money started going missing. Money right out of our wallets, which added to the negative energy we both felt.
I was honestly thinking what I'm sure you're thinking. We were just being careless or maybe we forgot about a purchase? But we've always been very responsible with our money since we live pay check to pay check. We blamed each other and fought but soon realized we were both equally frustrated and confused. Still, nothing paranormal ever came to mind. Until two days ago.
I could not find my medicine. It's not a controlled substance, just an SSRI for my mild depression. I looked absolutely everywhere. We have a drawer with his sleeping medicine and my SSRI that has always been THE place where we put our medications. Well I found my bottle, on the floor, under a pillow, and opened. How in the hell it got there is baffling us. Then last night, we needed some tin foil to bake some chili dogs and couldn't find the roll anywhere. We looked in every nook and never found it. This morning I get a text from my husband saying he found the roll. I laughed and said something like ""we're getting old babe lol"". He said no, it was in the fridge. We looked in the fridge last night. Like right there in the fridge, couldn't miss it.
I can't handle this anymore. It's driving me to the brink of madness. I feel like I have no control in my home, and my husband feels the same way. Look, all I want to know is if this could be the work off some kind of poltergeist that feeds of negative human emotion? Is there such a theory?",1488940160.0

Every few days I'll have a bowel movement. A lot of times (sorry TMI) they're pretty difficult. However, for the past week I've been feeling really bloated and whatnot. I took one dulcolax yesterday and it had NO effect at all. I took two early this afternoon and still don't feel anything working.

1. Almost never makes me wait more than 5-10 mins. Often immediate service.
2. Gives extras to his longterm clients (even like 8 for $60).
3. Fat bags.
4. Reliable quality. Sometimes it's ""knock your socks off"" level and sometimes it's just decent, but never *bad*.
5. Always willing to front a regular a couple bags as long as they've paid him back in the past, especially if they're sick.
6. Works bright and early. I'm talkin before 7 AM sometimes. Though he does close up shop by 11 usually, but I've learned to get there earlier in the evening when there's less heat anyway.
7. Doesn't pick sketchy ass spots for meetups.
8. Gave me some free suboxone when I went through a brief phase of trying to quit. (It was still packaged and worked fine...not like he gave me fake shit to have me running back haha). Even told me to hang up and do the right thing when I started calling again until I got persistent enough. He said he had enough clients and wanted me to succeed if I really wanted out hahah <3
9. Always answers the phone.
10. Generally honest about how long he needs and where he's at.

At the most I pick up 12g. It comes in one big block - not chopped up at all. My tester smokes it, and tells me they taste very little adulterants (lactose, etc.) at all. 

It comes rock hard but if you breathe on it and rub it around a little it turns soft (but not goopy/sticky).

In California hypothetically, how much would one charge people for the following amounts?

I will start off by telling you guys about my piece of shit truck I was driving. The drivers door was jammed shut so I had to crawl over from passenger side. The window was missing so I had plastic taped up with a little hole cut in it that I could look in my mirror and flip out cig butts. I could also flip my cig butts through the holes in the floor. It did run pretty good though and I only paid 500 for it. My wife thinks that was 450 too much but hey, it got me to work. 
So I was working about 15 minutes away from my dopeman and was feeling pretty shirty. I called him around 8 am and asked for a 20 on the front. He said he would call me back once he got up and moving around. I thought, yeah right he ain't calling. Well to my surprise I get a call around 930 and he said come on through bro, ok got you. I tell my boss my wife and her friend got a flat tire on their way to Florence Mall and had to change it for them. 
I peel out and get to my dude. He hooks me up and I go to my usual smoking spot. I stash sheets of foil all over Cincy so grab a sheet, make a fool tooter, and get that sweet relief. I peel out from their and get back to work. As I am crawling over in to passenger seat to get out I notice an envelope that says Merry Christmas on it.  I open it up and to my absolute amazement it is a Christmas card with a 100 dollar bill in it! I can't believe my fucking eyes. I go to my boss and ask him if he put a card in my truck with $100. He says Fuck no. I didn't think so. The only thing I can think is that the day before I was at the park n ride and some one saw my piece of shit truck parked there. They felt sorry for me and dropped the card in on the seat. 
So we got done with that job and had to go to another job. I made a pit stop and snatched up a half on the way there. 
I think junkie Santa was looking out for me. Sorry if you guys didn't find this story good but it is %100 true. Let me know if you think it was Junkie Santa or Junkie Jesus or just some goofy Christian with too much money. Thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed.",1489025443.0

so ive been back at it for about 2 1/2 months and i want to stop this time. my bf died from subs, xans, drinking and i think he was trying to shoot dilauded on top of that... anyway im scared as shit to do xans and cant find any legit ones. i have about 1 3/4s of those generic suboxone pills with the half moon on it but i really  am not a fan of them. 

my question is how long/bad will my withdrawls be physically? after 2 1/2 months back on blues?(i know its hard to be exact) i already am probably the most depressed i have ever been so im not sure how much my mood chage will be. i want to do something as quick as possible, with maybe some maintenance for the future when i get cravings. ive been told about kratom, and PST.

I'm a licensed mental health therapist working with those who suffer from opiate and alcohol dependence. I'm wondering if anyone has had personal experience in therapy where it was either very helpful or perhaps not-so-much. 

I consider myself a decent therapist in the sense that I am easy to talk to and I never judge my clients (I've had my own share of drug use). However, I know there are only so many times I can discuss relapse prevention, withdrawal symptoms, the importance of support groups, etc. 

I'd be interested in hearing how others have experienced addiction therapy. I am always looking for ways to make therapy more helpful and more enjoyable for my clients. Thank you!",1488993006.0

Peoples cars were broken into.  People who left their garage door open had shit stolen from them.  About a dozen neighbors decided to hold a meeting.  One said he recognized the thieves as two brothers who live in the neighborhood.  We decided to set up a sting operation.

We parked a car near the community pool/park.  Left tools in the backseat.  Left the car doors unlocked.  As soon as we saw the kids riding their bikes down the street.  We phoned law enforcement.  One brother stopped by the bait car.  The other rode past.  About 15 seconds after the kid opened the car door and started rummaging through the backseat, a police officer appeared.  Off to jail he went.

About a week later, I heard some young men talking behind my backyard (my fence backs up to a bike trail/park).  One mentioned being in jail for a week was horrible.  He was so dope sick and he was so glad his parents put up the $2k to bail him out.  He was so happy to be out of jail he wanted to ""steal everything in the neighborhood"" so he could buy a quad of black and a zip of g and get high as fuck for a couple days to celebrate his freedom.

The neighborhood crime fighters called another emergency meeting.  This time, we had 4 volunteers offer to leave their garage doors open over night and keep a lookout for suspicious activity.  One of our neighbors is a contractor and rigged a chain link fence to the side of each garage.

Night fell and sure enough, the brothers on bikes come riding down the street.  We phone the police.  The older one again stops by the garage that is left open.  Shines his flashlight around, looking for shit to steal.  The neighborhood crime fighters quickly swing the chain link fence across the open garage.  Blocking our brilliant thieves escape.

He begs, pleads, says it will never happen again, cries ect.  The police show up, take him to jail, where he will likely be for a little while.

Haven't seen his little brother since.  The family has been cleaning up their house, borrowing a truck and packing and moving boxes.  I hope they are not trying to sell their house to raise cash to bail him out again.

Before you make dumb decisions.  Ask yourself if what you are about to do dumb as fuck or not.  If it is, don't do it.

I don't understand why people do dumb shit like this.  I have a legal hustle that I use to pay for dope/life.  There are a million legal things you can do to make cash.  You don't even need a job.  Just a legal hustle, so when you do acquire currency/dope, you can actually enjoy it.

Being dope sick sucks.  But being dope sick and in jail with pending felonies sucks even worse.

For those of you that are broke and dope sick.  Sometimes doing shit the hard (for now) way is the easiest way. (ex: get a job, if you are dope sick that means you have some clean time under your belt already.  Suffer for a couple more days, get a job and pass a drug test (or get fake piss, whatever), then start using.  Now you have money coming in every week/2 weeks whatever.  Your worry now is using in moderation.

Your best option may be a minimum wage job for now.  Some money is better than no money.  I know people that sit at home all day and bitch about being dope sick try for hours to come up with $10 or $20 just to get right.  If you got a job and worked, you would be infinitely better off than you are without working.

Honestly, I am tweakin right now.  Ran into a few retards last night and had to share a story.  Plus a bunch of unemployed junkies keep blowing my phone up looking for a get well.  They ask every day for a get well.  Other than their habit, they are perfectly healthy and capable of working.  IF YOU CAN, DO!",1489157096.0

So I told her I wanted 28 of them which go for 25 a pop, now keep in mind I went through her twice before and the pills were good.  This time I got there and gave her the money first (huge mistake) and the guy came and dropped them off to her.  Now I have been doing roxies on and off for 4 years, I usually do 8-12 a day.  As soon as she handed them over I noticed right away they were small as hell and a couple of them were different and fat.  I said right away these are fake, she she ""called"" him right back and the guy tried spewing off bullshit that some of the roxies were M's and that's why they were fatter then the A's.  I was desperate my fellow bropiates, BROPIATES STAND UP, so I broke up three which were a bitch to break up.  Anyone who does roxies knows that the As are a breeze to break up, I then proceeded to visciously snort them.  Now my nose was fucked up as it is, so at the time I couldn't really tell by the smell/taste, I would later find out after some good old afrin to clear the nose that it had this weird smell/taste to it that is very hard to describe.  I love the taste of a roxy, I enjoy the drip and everything associated with it .  Now I'm guessing that it is fentanyl because it really fucks me up, my pupils get pin pointed to the max and it gives me a really hard nod   I told this bitch that I gave some pills to a friend and that my friend overdosed.  I said they had to give him narcan and the brother is threatening to come shoot me and that they are really dangerous.  I had to say that I was staying away from where I live because when they see me they are going to hold a gun to my head and take me to where I got them from.  She tried calling me and has been religiously texting me back so there is a part of me that thinks she may of not been aware that these were being sold off as real pills when there fake.

I am having some weird sensations throughout the last three days of use. I got a new batch from my reg dude. I've been going strong for the last 3 days, but when I started this new batch, I have been getting these strange, energetic lapses overtaking the fade. They have been occurring more and more frequently. Sitting here now, it is at its worst.
I just blasted an hour ago. This new batch has intense pins and needles. It makes me vigorously scratch my head till the pins are gone. After they are gone, I get these strange energy bursts that overpower my fade. It almost feels  like meth. The strangest part of this sensation though, is the vertigo. I am typing this from my phone. Just sitting here, it feels like my body wants to twist from back right to from left and downward. Holding my phone out in front of me, elbows on my legs, my phone also pulls from right to left like the middle of my phone is on a swivel. I actually have to fight it, or it will twist.
I am going to take a tolerance break after this bag is done, unless y'all suggest otherwise. If someone has experienced these adverse effects, please comment. I'm a little worried. Hopefully you can lighten the situation for me.

Do one up the nose and regardless of current tolerance i would get fuuuuuuuuucked up. Better deal for the money than any other option on the market so I was careful but def enjoyed them while they were around 

In the last year I've come across multiple different versions of fakes, all different imprints; some too big, some white instead of blue, some made of nothing but chalk, some with what seemed to be OC, many with what seemed to be fent or something equally as dangerous.... 

So today I figured I'd grip a few more off this batch. No clue of the origins or if the owner is claiming they're real or not... but after doing one or two more throughout the afternoon I quickly realized that while strong, nothing close to those ones from last summer 

So tonight I get home w the new batch- break down two, and in the middle of one I see... a large spot/streak of black. So, def not from the pharmacy. But I have no idea what it is! I snorted the line like 45 mins ago (and told one or two people where I was, what was going on, and to call 911 if they hadn't heard from me by _____o'clock.

About a week ago my surgeon, who did the past two surgeries on my knee, agreed to give me 30 5mg oxycodone pills per month (reluctantly). 
I just finished the prescription, and I know tomorrow I'm going to be in pain again.
Should I call the doctor and tell him I ran out of pills? Should I say one of my roommates stole them and that is why I ran out? Or should I just wait out the month in pain and get the next prescription when the time comes? Or should I go ""doctor shopping""?
Obviously I would buy some if I could find some, but my campus is more dry than the Sahara. 
Any advice is appreciated. Much love. ",1489122567.0

He hits me up when I'm 5 mins away bitching saying if I'm not there in 2 mjns he's leaving and I'm just thinkin damn how many times have u left me sitting for 30+ mins waiting on u? He was bitching bout waiting 10 mins for me to show up but anyway I get to him an he is being a dick and sold me some straight garbage. And it was light. This never happens so idk if dude got fucked somehow on reup or was just in a really bad mood and took it out on the next person to call which was me but I was super tight. Thankfully he met me next door to another dboy of mines house and he had hmu saying he had some shit that'll
Make me do the James brown lol. Had no money of course but called him anyway asking for a sample to try the new stuff out since he knows I middle for a lot of people and will bring him a lot of money he agrees and shows up 3 mins later with a nice bit of gun powder for me. Now I hate tar, gun powder, etc...I only like ecp but when broke and being given a free bag I'll take whatever. This shit was phenomenal lol and the best part about tar is I can usually do 2/3 nice cotton shots out of it. So of course after I do my two shots and get home I end up getting 4 cotton washes out of these 3 cottons and each shot fucked me up as if I did a normal shot. I was amazed and I literally just did my last wash cause I finally came out f my nod and wanted to go back and surprisingly got another nice shot out of the wash and even caught a short rush. Crazy shit. Anyone else do multiple washes of their tar cottons? That's the only benefit I see in doing that shit otherwise it's powder all day long. ",1489120461.0

So you could do 15 days (or 30) with the dosage prepackaged for you and even have a placebo towards the end so you could start skipping days but still take a pill. 30 days to freedom.

However, the more i research it on respectable scientific websites the more convinced I am.

I decided to try it myself after a 1 month heavy IV opiate binge, i took around 200g of ascorbic acid prepared in a few bottles and chugged it throughout 3 days at random times- i have to say it took away around 70% of all physical withdrawal symptoms however did not take away mental ones as i experienced extreme depression during my detox as well as a lack of motivation to do really anything and a lack of appetite, however after taking some xanax my mood and appetite increased significantly. Please note that i was also taking 'Animal pak' which is a fitness supplement that is a combination of basically many different vitamin/mineral/random supplement and drinking protein shakes due to my lack of appetite and needing nutrition. What do you lot think? After all these pretty respectable studies is this vitaminC megadose thing still utter BS?

What do you lot think? There is a lot of proof this vitaminC stuff works:

*Proven studies:*


*1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10836211

TLDR:
Heroin addicts as patients
Control group treated with conventional meds (no vit C) experienced major withdrawal in 56.6% of patients.
Vitamin C group experienced major withdrawal in 10-16.6% 
*some bias in this study however if you read into it*

*2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852062/

TLDR:
Rats addicted to morphine and then put into precipitated WD with naloxone showed far less 'escape jumps and tail flicks' (sort of like RLS) when they were treated with high dose Ascorbic Acid 

*3. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6686637

TLDR: 
In mice: vit C, when co-administered with morphine, suppresses the development of tolerance and physical dependence on the drug

*4. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5107231/

TLDR:
97 patients, half given high dose 50 mg/kg vitamin C, the other half placebo. Both groups given morphine before operation. 2 hours after surgery the VitC group self administered significantly lower morphine consumption and reported LOWER pain after 24 hours than the placebo group (only morphine group)

*5. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183085/

TLDR:
Complex study (barely understood it) on mice basically proving Vit^C had a profound effect when combined with Tramadol or Morphine   

*6. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25250292

TLDR:
Rats had operation to fix a cannula to their vein, then subjected to 12 days of self-administration of morphine for 12 days, if rats received high dose of VitC before self-admin, they used less morphine, also, rats injected with higher doses of Vit^C showed significantly less symptoms after naloxone induced precipitated WD.

Just trying to make sure I'm doing this the right way 

And yes I know the bioavailability of Oxycodone is about 25% higher when taken orally opposed to snorting. But when I have only one 10mg Oxycodone with a 30mg tolerance, I find snorting to be the most satisfying with this low dose.

Each patch contains 16.4mg of fentanyl so that's about 80mg a day. My plan is to switch to H, but I'm thinking I wouldn't even feel h or would have to do absurdly dangerous amounts to feel anything. I feel dead inside and fentanyl is eating me alive. It feels like I'm constantly in withdrawal no matter how much I do..and as some of you know you're sick within 30/40mins. Sometimes sooner. I haven't slept more than an hour/1.5hr in the past 4 years. My body wakes up on its own every hour or so, fiending for more. No REM sleep in 4 years probably has me fucked up really bad too.

I'm sick of no sleep, no euphoria, being too sedated, etc etc. I'm not ready to get sober but I'm ready to get off fentanyl and need advice and basically just want to hear other people's experiences with high doses of fentanyl.

Was in jail last weekend. Please read if you have any advice to share with me. Scared out of my mind.","Hi guys. I dunno if you remember my post recently about getting arrested with heroin and paraphernalia. 
Well.
When I was originally arrested, a narcotics detective came into the room where I was being fingerprinted and said to me basically I can get out of this if I help him. I wasn't rude about it, but I said ""I don't have much info that can help you and I'm not big into the snitching game"".
He said, he knows because of the location of my apartment, ""I definitely know some things. And they will find out anyway. Hopefully you'll go down with them next time!!!"" 
I ignored this. Whatever. I don't get my shit in my town so I honestly don't even know what he's talking about! Got my shit, got released, etc.
Fast forward 2 weeks. I have a warrant out that I didn't even know about from some other traffic ticket. A stupid ""failure to show documents"" one. So it's a Saturday morning,boyfriend and I are sleeping, I wake up to my bedroom door being opened and 3 detectives in vests with guns screaming at me to get out of bed! ""WE HAVE A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST. WHERE ARE THE DRUGS"" I said I have no drugs, I've been trying to stay clean (TRUE. I have been on subs since my arrest!). They are telling me over and over again we will get the dogs, tell us now and your boyfriend won't go down too!!! I said I DONT HAVE DRUGS! 
This ONE detective who was the one there when I got arrested is the one orchestrating this entire thing. the other 2 are standing in my living room blocking me from going near my boyfriend, and staring at my Guinea pigs who are running around scared to death.
So I say just arrest me and get it over with.
He starts going through my drawers. This one detective is doing all the searching. I have no idea if this is even ok . He yells at me to get dressed but they won't even leave my room to let me do that. So the detective finally finds a pill, asks me what it is, and I say it's a suboxone (I realize I should have lied. It was retarded) and he goes ok nice. Puts it in his pocket, takes  my boyfriend's phone (??), they cuff me and take me down where I get another charge of ""possession of suboxone"" over this one pill he found. I spent the weekend in county. Waiting to see the judge on Monday, I was able to be bailed out after that. 

What the actual FUCK. Do I fight this? Was this seriously done right? I'm terrified what will happen next. Anything you can say will really help me out. Thanks guys :( 

EDIT - the fact that people are coming on here just to attack me, tell me how stupid I am, etc just shows why people are afraid to reach out to others. Nowhere in my post did I ask for anything except some experiences with what happened to me. I never said I'm some innocent girl who never deserved to be arrested. ",1489082217.0

What can I expect for withdrawals? Can I count up to 96 hours and expect the physical part to pass? Kratom and Loperamide worth getting? 

Guess I just need some support and advice since I cut everyone else out and I only have my wife who knows


Hey fellow bropiates...Im on mobile so excuse any formatting issues. Just a few questions on withdrawals. 

Recently my wife and I have picked up a very small habit. We've been banging some pretty decent tar for a bit and were quitting for good for more reasons than one... Financial, health, happiness, and our relationship...Ive got a relatively significantly bigger habit than she, but it's still absolutely nothing compared to some of my buddies. 

For the past few months, we've been chippers, picking up between 1 and 2 gs of bth and taking short breaks in between. I had quit for a bit but got into an accident and got put on the shittiest opiates known to man - first Tylenol 4s, then tramadol. I was taking 6-8 50mg tramadol (didn't do much) a day for about a week and then we switched back over to black. Cue us picking up and shooting up between 3 and 5 points a day for me, and about 2 to 3 points a day for her. 

I'd say it's been about a month of steady usage, however we've been good about tolerance. She usually shoots between half a point and a point and that gets her good. Just about a week ago she was throwing up all day because of a point shot after a short 2-3 day break, so I know she'll be good as far as WDs go. I had my last shot on March 8th at around 2am, it was a point and a half and it had me nodding hard. 

I'm just kinda wondering what to expect since I started feeling kinda crappy today, sniffles and shits and anxiety and some pretty serious energy/fatigue/RLS combo. I've definitely been using tar for under half a year and the first three months I had weeks of non-use in between. The past 2-3 months have been on and off, but not off for more than 3 or 4 days. I don't know where my tolerance lies, how withdrawals will be, or how long they will last. 

I've made up my mind to quit, I know theres no way I'm picking up more and my wife is the best accountabilibuddy I could ask for. 

Esssntially, are small doses of Loperamide or Kratom worth it? I've only been taking modafinil, ibuprofen 800s,and my prescribed Valium for insomnia. We also quit smoking pot about 6 days ago, we were heavy stoners and could put away 2g of some frosty bud every day and could function fine. So I don't feel great because of that but I'm almost 7 days clean and over the hump with no desire to get more. I have a full time job so days off are out of the question.
