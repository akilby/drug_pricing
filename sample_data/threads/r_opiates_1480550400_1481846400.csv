How many of us are disgraced former hustlers? (or how I started selling dope, overdosed twice, and ruined my life)","I started out doing dope or opiates very occasionally, and was able to keep it at once a month or once every 3 or 4 months for 2 and a half years. I always sold drugs but I could never ""blow up"". One day I make a new connect and like a quarter bag gets me nodding the FUCK out. I flipped 4 bags for 15 each to make back what I spent on my half bun. This worked 3 or 4 weekends until the connect went to rehab for his own addiction. Now I'd done community service with a dude from the hood who I got tight with. He did like half his life in prison and I'm a white college kid but we kicked it with his family and split a bag of dope when his wife was in the other room. I need a couple bundles, so I ask him to chill on the phone not to be a dick like I'm only going for the dope. 

I get over there to the hood where I'm right at home with all the 50cent loosie spots. We're accosted by a one-legged dude with some of the sharpest/glaring eyes I've still seen to this day. He has  a gruff voice and scares me slightly. I'm not a tough guy or anything but I've copped off/with enough ""gangstas"" not to be put off by them. It doesn't matter what size you are, a .40 will blow your head off proper. This guy isn't big or anything, and he's a cripple but something about him is just sharp and observant and deadly. Later my homie tells me that's his dad and he's out on parole after doing 20+ on a murder. Oh by the way homie is also on parole with an ankle braclet.

A fat white guy in a hoopdie rolls up and asks if we want to mix cement for $10-$12/hour. I don't want to do this bullshit but homie is broke and living in a trapped out squatted crib with kids and I know he could use any money. He's polite and doesn't tell the guy that he doesn't want to go. We stand there for a few seconds like some awkward middle school boy at their first school dance until I'm like fuck it nigga let's go.

Mixing cement in the sun is fucking back-breaking work and it was incredibly exhausting for my frail already coke-addicted body. Of course, $10-$12/hr ends up meaning $10. 3 hours, $30, and a lot of sweat later, I have my bundles.

I need to sell some weed too so I hop the train back over to my side of Brooklyn to the weedman who hooks me up with a lot of shit. Real cool dude. Recently was on the news for getting raided. Cops tweeted a picture of the loot, few pounds of weed like $15k in cash and some tools. 

Anyway weedman started selling coke through his brother, a total junkbox. His brother begs and begs me for a bag to try. I don't want to give it up cuz I already got it pre-sold but then he tells me the magical words I'd been looking for: ""I can get grams"".

Holy shit /r/opiates, it was like a new world was opened to me. Story goes dude wanted a brick of girl from Chicago but el jefe sends him a half key of dope instead. Very fishy story but I never saw my now dealer serve anyone else. I'm pretty sure me and the dude I was copping with ended up copping the whole half key. 5grams a piece, 3-4 times a week, with extras often, that shit'll add up.

I end up going to college with 2 phones on me all the time, speedballing in the bathroom and nodding out through my finals. I have a .5-1g of dope a day habit (snorted) on top of coke, a quarter ounce of bud, and whatever else makes it in the cut.

Now I'm broke, my friends are all under investigation or in court, and I'm getting kicked out of my apartment. Don't know where I'm going with this. Don't do dope. It's not worth the $35 for mixing cement.",1480605316.0

[heroin overdose],"I (26f)lost my little sister to a heroin overdose in late 2012. she was only 20 years old  when she had passed. i am not sure if it was intentional or not either. she had gotten very sick a couple weeks prior to her passing. she had MRSA in her blood stream, so that means that it had affected every part of her. she had almost passed from that. she got well enough to go home. the doctors told her that she CANNOT do heroin any more. her body would not allow it. i i had to go out of town 2 days after she had gotten released from the hospital. it was the last time I have seen my sister. my dad found her... it breaks my heart sooo bad when i think of how my dad had felt finding her like that.. and how he feels now. i fucking hate that I had to leave her in that condition. i have soooo many regrets about things I should have done differently, things I should have said or shouldnt have said, etc. She passed away October 2nd, 2012. It was and still is hard to 'accept'.  When she had passed, the first half a year or so, was extrememly crazy for myself. You'd think that having this happen to my sister, that I would wake the fuck up and come to my senses and get clean, but that unfortanely was not the case. I was doing as much heroin AND meth that i could get my hands on. I did not give a single fuck for a while. It is very embarrasing when I think back to those days. That was not me. I had gotten the cops called on me more then ever. Because I was causing problems for people. I was very unstable, and hurting extrememly bad. I didn't know how to handle the emotions I was feeling.

Years later, I am no longer shooting meth or heroin thank god. I am  tryiing my hardest to make my sister happy and proud and live her legacy. I still do not understand why fucked up things like her passing have to happen, but it did. No one will ever understand ME like she did. or understand my humor. god i miss her. She is so greatly missed, and i will never forget the best friend I had.

I wont be getting texts or phone calls that i need to worry about.  I dont know maybe im weird, but i just feel more comfortable at night and i find that im more sociable and just happier.

5fuped,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5fuped/dilaudid_seizures/,3,https://redd.it/5fuped,laminar316,Dilaudid seizures?,"So it's Wednesday night now. Monday evening I dislocated my shoulder and started slamming dilaudid, because fuck that. I shot about 20mg over the course of 5-6 hours. I finally started to crash at around 11, and going to bed I was seeing white flashes every five minutes or so and having some pretty serious myoclonus (twitching), which, in my heavily sedated state, I did not realize was seizure aura. Mind you, I've been having issues with myoclonus ever since I overdosed on IV cocaine (which I will NEVER do again), and my seizure threshold is probably low as as result.

Around this time I also started hearing things - a cough that appears to originate from my closet, people walking around upstairs... You name it. The important thing is that I know none of these could have been real, and the acoustics certainly didn't match my room at all. This alone was pretty freaky.

At midnight, I am close to falling asleep when I suddenly smell dill (as in the herb) and am caught off guard by it. So I sniff harder, and get a nauseating wiff of car exhaust. This prompts me to flip over in my bed, and a few seconds later I see a BIG white flash. I flinch violently, and suddenly I'm filled with confusion and terror. I jump out of bed and turn on the lights. It takes me half an hour to get a hold of myself.

Upon taking to google, apparently [dilaudid metabolizes to hydromorphone-3-glucuronide, which is neuroexcitatory and is suspected to put patients receiving heavy infusions at risk for seizure and myoclonus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11459432). Tuesday evening I took a total of 10mg, and had very similar (but not as pronounced) side effects, so I am 99% certain it's the dilaudid causing the seizures.

It was fucking awful. You wouldn't think there was anything inherently hellish about what I went through, but the fact is that I had seizure symptoms and then suddenly was zapped with profound confusion and abject terror. I honestly never want to do dilaudid ever again because of it, and has definitely encouraged me to kick opiates completely because now the opiate high gives me anxiety about having a seizure. I wasn't entirely sure it was the drugs causing the seizures, but I think I confirmed this for sure on Monday evening. 

I just took a bunch of gabapentin to help me get to sleep. Tomorrow I'm picking up some clonazepam (I fucking hate benzos) to help with the persistent myoclonus. There's some Opana and methadone in the mail for me soon. I made arrangements to sell it to a buddy at cost, but I hate it because my shoulder is still in bad shape and can't even get muscle relaxers because my chart says ""junkie."" Trust me, I tried today. Needless to say, I'm finding a new primary care. I fucking hate these kinds of situations, where you want to not take drugs but you have a completely legitimate reason to.

End rant. **Have the dilaudid or heroin seizures stricken anyone else?** I know seizures from H and morphine can also cause this, and seizures are considered an OD symptom as a result. But I'm well certain that opiates shouldn't be causing seizures unless it's due to the accumulation of some neuroexcitatory metabolite. That is to say, Opana wouldn't cause this.",1480567854.0

Well here recently I have been very broke and struggling, and my entire check I get for the next 2-3 weeks is gone due to being off work for a couple weeks and getting behind on things. Well I've been pretty disappointed about that and feeling like shit. So long story short I end up going to a Christmas parade with my girl to try and feel better and as they are throwing candy to kids, one of our very popular local hunting/nice clothing businesses threw a gift card and we catch it last night. We get on their Facebook and happen to find info that they had thrown out 100 gift cards mainly $5-25, and you had to come to the score and they would scan it and tell you how much you won, and that one card was a grand prize winner. So today we go to that store as soon as I'm off work and I'm just hoping it'd be one of the $25 ones so I can maybe sell it and be well. Literally did not believe the guy behind the counter when he told us we had won the grand prize! Score, at this point I'm like hell yea we won $100 I'm guessing. Nope. We won mother fucking one thousand dollar gift card!!!!! I thought this had to all be all a joke at this point, but nope! We really won, so me and the girl split it and she got $500 worth of nice clothes and even got me some, and I of course sold mine to a buddy for $350 in cash. Oh, and to top it all off, I hit up my dgirl and she has roxy 15s that she will let me get for $12 each. So went snd picked up 30 of em and a pack of smokes.

I've recently been given a lot of tramadol, and have taken it every day for the past four days or so. Nothing major, I think like 400mg the first night, and trying to stay at 300mg and below the following nights.  Now like many of you, I'll freely admit that I have a bit of a ""thing"" for opiates... in the past, I've taken similar doses of tramadol many times and quite enjoyed it.  However, these past few days as I've been reading up on it, I've found soooo many forum posts (here and elsewhere) where people go on and on about how dangerous it is.

I think the real thing that I find so hard to believe is that I've read a few people say that tramadol can cause seizures at *recommended* doses... that can be as low as 50mg...  

Now, I have more of these, and I've never had any problems with them before... and on top of that, it's very very hard for me to have opiates and not take them.  But I've kind of freaked myself out a bit seeing some of this stuff.  I'm not here to call anyone a liar, and I'm not informed enough to exactly debate what I've seen these random people say... but through all my use and others I've known who frequently use it, I've never heard of anyone have a seizure (and I know a couple people who abused it far more than I ever have)...  But if I'm taking like 150-250mgs over a couple-few hours, am I really at a risk (however small) of just seizing out one night?

If that's the case, I find it so fucking sickening that doctors will prescribe something like this instead of something safer just because there is less ""potential for abuse"".  And I'm sure there are others like me out there who are willing to take opiates the aren't prescribed for the high, and if these are starting to be more available than anything else than it's really dangerous for people like me- especially considering the vast majority don't even bother to look into it very much.

Anyway, like I said it's my first post so sorry if am breaking some rule I didn't see.  My main hope for this post is to get a more level idea on how much risk there actually is with me taking the doses that I am.  Thank you so much for any input.

I'm on day 6 of recovery from getting my tonsils out. I've been taking around 10-15 mgs of oxycodone every 3-4 hours for pain. Among the bullshit side effects I'm experiencing is the inability to pee. I'm drinking more than enough fluids, and my urine is light colored, so I know I'm not dehydrated. I have the urge to go about every 2 hours, which is normal for me, yet it takes me like 10-20 minutes of sitting there before I can actually go, if I can. More than a few times now, I've had to give up and come back later. :( 

I already called my doctor, and he said that this is not a normal side effect of Oxy as far as he knows. He also didn't have any advice for me about it. He just said to let him know if it gets really bad or if I get so uncomfortable that I need a catheter. 

Do any of you guys have any solutions or at least some experience with this?? I can't take Hydros or anything like that because they make me throw up even more than oxy does-even with nausea medication like Zofran. And tramadol is not recommended after tonsillectomies. And not taking the Oxycodone is absolutely not an option, this is the most pain I've ever been in.

5ftvod,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5ftvod/grandpas_funeral/,32,https://redd.it/5ftvod,10xSugar,Grandpa's funeral,"So I was heading down there for my grandfather's funeral. It's a 12 hour drive from here and I wasn't prepared, so when I set out that morning (driving down with my mom, dad was already there) I was not prepared. I only had 4 bags on me and I was already sick. 

At the first place we stopped to get coffee, I shoot 2 bags and switch over to driving. I manage to make it down there and pick up my dad before doing the other 2 bags, in the back seat lmao while my parents sat up front. 

Get over to grandpa's house and see all the pill bottles sitting around. My parents know how I am though and were watching me like a hawk. I still managed to scoop up a bottle of trazodone which I like for wds.

So we finish the cleaning for the day, pick up my junkie aunt and head to the hotel. I noticed my dad put my grandpa's fanny pack in the trunk so I made up some excuse to go out to the car and raided the bag. Score! A bottle of bars that was almost full! Immediately popped 2, and that's when the bad decisions started, and the withdrawals kicked in. 

Ended up raiding my aunt's purse while they were all out smoking, stealing a few Klonopin and a few percs.

I popped the percs immediately and transferred the bars and Klonopin into the cellophane from my cigs so I could hide it easier.

7/11 was right across the parking lot so I head over and buy a 40oz of king cobra. Down it while talking to a few people outside, and pop a few more bars. 

Walking back over to the hotel I see a party going on in a room. Oh btw white people are a minority in my grandpa's town. So I walk over to a guy sitting down outside the room and ask him where to score some boy. He says he can get it but I gotta smoke a blunt with him first. I tell him I'm down and he says he'll be tight back. I wait for what seems like half an hour (probably was 5 min) and get bored and go walking.

Back at the 7/11 they tell me I can't hang out in the parking lot, so this older crackhead chick says to come with her. I tell her what I'm looking for but how I got no cash but can trade a tablet for it. She says okay and tells me I gotta wait outside the house while she grabs it. I wait and wait and then cops start rolling by so I dip back to the hotel.

Down a few more bars and end up talking to some dude on a bench who calls himself black. I tell him I need dope and he asks how much. I tell him how I just got the pills to trade. Dude hits me with something, runs my pockets, grabs the pills and runs.

I take my bleeding face back to the hotel room and pass out. Wake up the next morning sick as fuck, bloody, huge bruise on my face, and gotta get dressed up for the funeral.

Luckily my uncle is a meth head and showed up in shorts, ripped tank top, and work boots, or I would've been the one looking the worst there. 

---
After the funeral we went out to eat with the extended family, and everyone knew I wasn't right. I was real sick at this point, running to the bathroom etc.

In the bathroom I pop 150mg trazodone, just hoping to feel anything other than sick. What I didn't know was that trazodone is a pretty strong sedative, so I start falling asleep at the table.

The next day my parents are pissed at me, but we gotta load up their car with all my grandpa's shit. Who shows up but my (other) uncle who knows I'm a junkie cause I used to nab his pills. He starts giving me the heaviest shit to load cause he can see I'm sick.

After about 8 hours of hell we gotta drive back home, so I pop another 300mg trazodone and just knock out. Wake back up in nyc and ran straight to my dealer lol",1480557890.0

I am the only one in any of my groups of friends who has *our* problem (or some of us anyway). I am a chronic relapsing H addict. I spend maybe half the year in my addiction and half of it on subbies, or abstinent or whatever. It's an ongoing problem I'm working on.

As a result of the stigma, my own insecurities and the self esteem issues that come with this, I find myself isolating - staying away from people, often thinking that I will reintegrate once I have solved the problem / been clean long enough that I can confidently say that it's in the past.

My question, to the socially adept of us here, is - how do you socialize with people? How do you stay socially relevant while dealing with this problem? I find that it's just too difficult when conversation inevitably comes my way and people ask - how are you, what are you up to, how are you doing, etc. and all I have going on is my constant battle with addiction?

Even though my other friends are normal 20-30 somethings, with no particular high achievements or whatever, I find it hard being that guy. Never making progress, constantly struggling with addiction, doing meetings or contemplating rehab (again). 

Is it possible to remain a relevant part of society when I'm going in circles with this problem? They have all been supportive in the past and never made me feel like shit for it, but to still be in this position...I'm just finding myself in an ever deeper isolation. Ignoring texts and calls, avoiding social gatherings because I'm just going to be the most ""worthless"" person there.

Anyone in a similar situation manage a relatively normal social life / have non self -esteem crushing conversations?

**TL;DR - how to have a normal social life as a perpetually relapsing heroin addict?**

So in order to break my cycle of Oxy, I got on Subs last month, this month I got my refill, and tapered off, because I didn't want to be on it forever. For the past two weeks my foot has been wrecked because I dropped something on it. Today I went to the Doc, and it was severely bruised, so he prescribed some meds, along with some T3. Took it to the pharmacy, waited for it to be fulfilled and then got the ""call back"" to the Pharmacist where she said she couldn't fill it because of the Sub subscription hadn't been more than 30 days and the Doc said to just void it. So now I'm STILL in pain with my foot, Ibuprofin doesn't help, Ice helps a bit, and now I feel like a complete MORON and JACKASS about this. The Doc tried prescribing me Tramadol and I told him it makes me sick (In reality, it relieves 0 pain, which is all I wanted the T3 for, not for fun) and now I'm stuck, and feel like a complete idiot.  Now I feel like I've pissed off the Doctor, and somehow my Wife is going to find out (even though my head rationally says there's no reason for the Doc to tell her, more or less legally tell her)

Again, if you want to scold me, save your time, I'm already beating myself to death about it... Just another day.. Throwaway because..reasons. Mainly just upset that I did something stupid and felt dumb in front of the Pharmacist and that she called the Doctor, and pissed because I should have just said forget the Sub subscription, and now I'm going to be in pain for however long with no relief at night or after a busy day chasing my kids around...

I bluffed my way into a big enough pot to cover a weeks worth of roxys. Whenever I double my chip stack in one hand, i go for a walk; this night, i happened to have my stash on me,  so i made my way to the restroom, found a stall, got out a foil and started smoking my rocker. I didnt realise i wasnt alone, as when i came out, an obviously high junkie explained that he was doing the same thing; he won a large hand and came to the bathroom to  smoke and celebrate.  He must have heard my foil and lighter, so he offered to sell me half of the ounce of tar had on him for $450. Again, I do not lile tar, but I was tempted because it sounded like a good deal.. perhaps a little too good of a deal; I began to wonder if he was trying to see if I had my winnings on me so he could rob me. 

My question is: does $450 sound accurate for a half zip of tar, and if not, what is more accurate or reasonable? And what about a quarter zip?  Ive heard eigth goes from  $150  on  lucky llow end, and $200 on  high end.


TL;DR whst do you pay for a half ounce or a quarter ounce of tar in your area?

 I only got home less than ten minutes ago. Took me two hours when it should have only taken me 45 minutes. So here's the story...

I'm driving to the other side of town to pick up a couple bags from my usual d-boy. I just hit the ATM so I have $100 in my pocket. Now I also stupidly have a rig in my car and a spoon cause I'm too eager and want to get high right when I pick up.

Now I have to mention that I'm driving my mom's car doing this and her tag was stolen some weeks ago. And I completely forgot about it and for whatever reason she hasn't got it replaced yet. Forgetful I guess. There is a piece of cardboard on the back that says ""STOLEN TAG"". So I make it not 5 minutes down the road after the ATM when I see a cop driving behind me. I immediately freak out. I change lanes in hopes that he will keep driving. Nope. He changes lanes with me. Now I know I'm fucked. I take the rig out my pocket and jam it into the cassette player and put the spoon in my mouth to try and make sure there is no residue on it.

And then it happens.

Flashing blue lights in my mirror. I pull over into the nearby apartment complex. Now I just got off probation like two months ago so at this point, my face is probably white with nervousness. He walks to my window and tells me he pulled me over for the tag. I tell him I reported stolen for my mom but she just hasn't gotten it replaced yet. He asks for my license and the registration then asks if he can search the car. I tell him no, I""m in a hurry to get to my girlfriend's house. (I don't even have a gf lol)

Anyway, as we all know, if you tell a cop no, you are now guilty in his eyes. I sit waiting for him to finish running my info, my dboy is trying to call me. Next thing I know, there are four fucking police units and another officer is telling me to exit the vehicle so the drug dog can sniff it out.

Fuck...

I stand by the curb while another officer searches me. Finds nothing but the $100. Now apparently the dog hits on something in the front seat. Bullshit. But now they have probable cause to search the vehicle. To my ignorance, the back cap of the needle popped off as I was taking it out of pocket. And the spoon is on the floor. They find both, but never find the needle in the cassette tape player. Then they start asking me questions.. when did I last use drugs? where is the heroin in the car? etc etc. I keep telling the truth. I'm not high. I don't have any dope. I relapsed a couple weeks ago after having over a year clean. But I'm trying to get back on track. There are some threats of taking me to jail if I don't tell them if I'm hiding any heroin. I seriously don't have any! 

I think it was around this point that a tow truck comes cruising in. Now I know I'm fucked. I'm going to jail for a bogus paraphernalia charge and my mom's car is going to the impound. Then they do a chemical test on the spoon's ""residue"" which takes like ten minutes. I tell them it's just a spoon, nothing more, nothing less. In the mean time, I'm chatting it up with one of the other officers who is super friendly. They tell me the residue is coming up positive for heroin. I think they're lying, trying to get me to incriminate myself. But I don't know for sure.

They are still considering arresting me. Then they ask me one more question. He swears that if I lie to him, he will take me to jail. ""What is that spoon used for?"" I tell him I have used it for heroin in the past. He asks when was the last time I used. Almost two weeks ago. Which is actually true. I'm still really scared I'm going to jail. They talk among themselves for a moment then approach me and give me a written warning for the tag. I seriously let out a bit of joyous laughter and my eyes started swelling up with tears I'm so relieved. I even tell the officer who made the call that I want to hug him lol. He gets real with me about my addiction, telling me I need to stay strong and get back on track, not to let this shit ruin my life again. Apparently, my mom also had my certificates in the back of the car from when I completed a program at the Center For Drug Free Living for drug court. The officer even mentions it, giving merit to my real try at getting clean. I'm no criminal, I'm just a sick man from the wrong side of the track marks. 

Thank you momma for that haha. We bid farewell, and the cops leave. I sit behind the wheel and seriously cry with laughter. I could have taken it as a sign, but I still drove to pick up two bags because I am so wired after what just went down. I think I can still feel some adrenaline, even after shooting one of those bags.

The universe was looking out for me this time. Maybe I should heed her warning and try getting clean again. For now, I guess I'll enjoy my little nod and thank the whoevers in the heavens for this. Maybe I'll post a little porn in the morning. For now, I just need to lay down.

It's crazy that someone would press this brand as they are very uncommon and not seen a lot. Maybe that's why they did, but who knows. You think one would choose a press that wouldn't throw up a red flag due to the user not seeing that brand before. Anyways, The pill was def off and had white ""hot spots"" in the middle of the pill that was visual to the naked eye (pics of said hotspots posted in the old thread). With that said, the main point of this post though is to post the comparison in case anyone in the future runs into these bc I'm sure I'm not the only one that will. I know at least one person that OD'd and had to get narcon administered bc of these, so it's def worth it to get the word out about these. Just a heads up I'm on the east coast. It's scary how good these guys are getting at pressing fent into fake pharmaceutical looking pills. There's a special place in hell for who ever does this.

I'm in serious pain and my meds aren't helping anymore,"I'm on Oxycodone for awful pain from a recent tonsillectomy. I started taking them 7 days ago with absolutely no tolerance. I'm taking 7 mg Percocets, and 5 mg liquid Oxy. My instructions are to take between 5-10 mgs every 4 hours for pain. That worked out fine for the first few days... It would take my 10/10 pain to about a 4 or 5. Starting on day 4, I noticed my pain seriously increased. Like unbearably. So I'd take ibuprofen with my Oxy or Percocet, and I'd take it closer to every 3 hours vs 4 hours. 

Yesterday and today my pain meds only last about an hour and a half-2 hours. Once it wears off, I can't even speak, my throat hurts so bad. Swallowing and burping are absolutely horrific and don't even get me fucking started on the hiccups.   :( So as soon as my pain would come back, I'd try to fend it off with a couple more mgs of my liquid Oxy. 

I only have 3 Percocet left and no more Oxy until tomorrow at 8 am. It's now 10 pm. Needless to say I'm scared and looking for alternatives to get me through the night? I have Kratom but it's of no use to me. And I don't have access to any other sort of pain medication besides Tylenol and ibuprofen. Smoking cannabis is out of the question while my throat is healing :/ 

Basically, does anybody else experience serious pain? How do you deal with it when your opies aren't doing the trick? 

And is this rapid tolerance buildup normal?? I have no idea why it's happening so fast but it doesn't seem right to me.

I had a friend who was so precise and quick w it I didn't even know he shot it but he was the exception not the rule. Is there anyone else who prefers not to be around shooters?

A little about me, I'm a 27 year old burnt out chef. I've been addicted to opiates for a decade now. Currently I ""chip"" and am doing my best to be ""clean"". 

I'm lucky enough to have a s/o that is willing to work with me through the ups and downs. She herself has never done more than smoke pot and drink, yet she never scolds me and offers nothing but support. 

Last year I had a non dope related near death experience and the subsequent recovery left me with a very different view on my use and my life.

Anyways, I'm sure I'll get to know you guys more as time goes, but for now I leave you with a question.

How have your views on your usage changed as time has progressed?

I'm not nearly as reckless as I used to be, I rarely mix my substances, I never touch speed anymore, and mostly I see my opiate use as a luxury and something to treat with respect now.   

Death never scared me, I've laughed off a few legitimate overdoses, but somehow this was different. I feel as if though so many ""good"" people don't walk away from what I did, that a life on dope would be such an insult to....somebody.

Forever, dopeheads, be it in one of my stays in jail, at the plasma center, or anywhere else, always try to tell me it's ""the same thing, but that money you spend on one roxy will you high for a week if you spend it on dope!"". In my gambling epicenter of a town, I have decent access to both roxys, and tar, but never powder. I've smoke tar probably 4-6 times, usually out of desperation. I won't even comment on the taste, but the high itself isn't pleasurable  me; it seems like it's all nod, no substance. Recently, by the luck of Junkie Jesus, a few bags of ECP turned  in town, so I decided to see what the hubbub was. Now, the ECP I tried was quite a bit more enjoyable than tar, but still didn't quite give me what I was looking for. A few of my dopehead friends, even the ones that have tried ECP before, commented on it's quality. Obviously, there is variation in the highs of different opiates. Comments?

Need advice/opinions,"Hey guys, I was curious on this and figured best place for advice is here since a lot of us are in the program.


If I take say, 2mg of my sub tonight and my appointment is at 1pm would it still show up? I know my benzos will for sure. They already know this appointment is 3 days after my script ran out and just said to ween myself down a bit to make it to this appointment. I'm just worried it might not show up even though the Half-Life is like 36 hours. 


However I drink lots of water leading up to the 12 panel test due to the fact I just can't piss when I'm being watched. I drink so much my urine would be considered diluted. However I bypass this by taking vitimans b-12 and 2, which makes the urine yellow again. I used to do this to pass my tests when I was smoking pot but I no longer do that since it just gives me anxiety attacks. 


So what I want to know (group wise) is If I take 2mg tonight since that's all I have, if I drink all my water will it not show up? Last time I drank so much water that thc didn't show up, and I even smoked in the way there. However my benzos and bupe showed up, but I was also taking 4mg twice a day since I feel after all this time that 8mg twice a day is just wasteful.

So i've had a few beers and like .5mg of xan so nothing to worry about regarding my safely... I just am a bit disinhibited and want to just vent.  I'm withdrawing which is most likely why I'm so emotional but i'm just bawling my eyes out over stupid bullshit.

I studied with this girl today who i've been friends with for a while but haven't talked to in a quite a few months and we've recently just reconnected. She gets my jokes, she's funny, we're just on the same fucking wavelength.  I haven't had a girl in a few years I say because I'm waiting for the ""right time"" but who the hell knows when that is  

Well, this girl has a fiancé and they are getting married in january so I am NOT getting in the way of that because they have been in love for like 5 years or some shit but I really haven't felt feelings for her in the past.. But today... Idk we just picked up right where we left off and I just miss having someone to just give me a fucking hug when I fucking need it. 

Someone to listen to my bullshit

Someone to love me unconditionally... Idk

I'm sure the time will come but everything in my life seems to be so fucking hard and this girl who I connect with so well is untouchable and i'd never do anything to get in the way of her love with her fiancé because I respect her too much.

Nights like these I just feel so alone.

I know it is the withdrawal that is making me so fucking emotional but fuck I'm a decent looking dude, intelligent, I have nothing but respect for women and here I sit bawling my eyes out spooning a body pillow and venting to random strangers.

I'm not suicidal or anything... school is just so fucking hard and finals are around the corner and then I have graduate school which is even fucking harder by such a high margin and i'm addicted to fucking heroin of all fucking things and I just want to fast forward to the part of my life where I have a solid job making good money helping people with someone to just give me a fucking hug when I fucking need it. The future honestly just scares the absolute shit out of me. So I shove drugs up my nose and up my ass to make the uncertainty be replaced by opiates. By what feels like love even though I know it is a faux amie (people who speak french can correct me) 

Thanks for reading this if you are, I really do appreciate it. I just want a fucking hug and none of my friends are texting me back and I am certainly not reaching out to this girl.

Damn i'm fucking pathetic.

I've only met a select few who i've connected with like this girl. Who I can get to laugh by just giving her a look.. just knowing what to say all the time. One of those people is my ex and I don't even want to get into that because that was years ago but maaannnnnn why do the good ones all have to be fucking taken ya know?

Guess i'll just cry myself to sleep. Man this post is pathetic i'm sorry guys. I really do have my shit together..... sometimes it just really doesn't seem like it. I've gone through 3 therapists none of which are a good fit and I just don't know what they have to offer.

Every single one has asked me ""so what would you like from me"" and I DONT FUCKING KNOW!!! Like fix my anxiety or find me a girl I can connect with that isn't getting FUCKING MARRIED DAMMIT.

Well thanks for listening to my bullshit. I'm sure you all have significantly worse problems than me, but right here right now I just feel.......... I just feel emotion. Which I haven't felt in literally months because of this fucking drug.

I wish I could have a hug more than anything right now. That's all I want.

Call me a pussy, call me an asshole, tell me to man the fuck up I don't care. I just need SOMETHING!

And my face gets sick

Stuck

Like a question unposed


Just climb aboard

The tracks of a trains arm

In my fragile family tree

And watch me floating inches above

The people under me


Please beware the quiet front yard

I warned you

Before there were water skies

I warned you not to drive

Dry your eyes, you poor devil


Are there really ones like these?

The ones I dream

Float like leaves

And freeze to spread skeleton wings

I passed through before I knew you


I believe it's just because

Daddy's payday is not enough

Oh, I believe it's all because

Daddy's payday is not enough


Just climb aboard

The tracks of a trains arm

In my fragile family tree

And watch me floating inches above

The people under me


She's a jar

With a heavy lid

My pop quiz kid

A sleepy kisser

A pretty war

With feelings hid

You know she begs me not to hit her

For example, yesterday I picked up 2 points of fent (from my regular guy who normally only sells dope) since I felt like attempting to catch a proper nod.  Now normally I avoid fent as I hate being sick 2 hrs later - but as mentioned I felt like splurging in hopes of a proper nod. Grabbed a pt of regular dope to keep me well.

Anyways, this fent did what I was hoping it would and more.  It made me nod for 45 mins and then later pass out/nod for 2 hrs.  Furthermore it it kept me high for 6-8 hrs!

Well this evening when I went to pick up the same thing (2 pts fent, 1 pt dope).  I was complimenting my dboy on the fent, as my dboy knew  I wasn't big on fent due to its duration (2 hrs and sick). Well he told me his fent was carfentanil which may be due to its duration. This dboy is admittedly oddly specific, for example his last batch of down/heroin he said was cut with w-18 for some extra kick.

Not withstanding, most dealers here sell either ""down/heroin"" (mainly heroin, made stronger with fent), ""fentanyl"" (fentanyl or likely ones of its analogues), or ""50/50 mix"" (heroin with a stronger cut of fent).


So yah thats my story and I guess question.  Does anyone else live in an area where heroin and fentanyl are openly sold??

It also won't stay on me, I had it on my arm and it kept falling off and making me opiate nauseous, so I moved it below my belly button, I'm not nauseous now and it is staying on better (it literally feels like it has no adhesive and it's super taped). But my pain since I've moved it is way worse. (It's about 4 inches below my belly button and off to the right) IDK, it feels like nothing. When I've taken it off, twice now, there's been big amounts of fluid left in the patch. (The fluid is the drug right? ) I'm confused, and scared of fucking around with the patch, because of the dangers of fent. I don't get how anyone would want this, I don't find it energizing, relaxing, or anything like any other opiate, not only does it not help with my pain, it's also nauseating and unpleasant,


It's also made by shit queen of the pharm factories,  Acatvis. (Back when I was on Percocet, if switched from Watson to Actavis and it's was like it became a worthless pill overnight, at least for me, maybe I'm crazy). So I'm switching brand soon as well.

I primarily use oxy, usually snort and occasionally I eat.  I've used dope a few times just when pills are dry.

Anyway, I've never IVed anything but the concept of shooting dope has really piqued my curiosity.  I've always enjoyed experimenting and I'm interested in shooting dope just once to see what its like, and the effects.  Sort of an experiment I'd be doing for the sake of science and my own knowledge.   

Anyone ever find themselves in the same boat?  Never IV, but tried it once, then returned to their normal usage pattern?  Or is that rush really so amazing that I'd be opening up a pandoras box that's impossible to close?  Even if I find it to be the most amazing thing ever, I am promising myself that it is just this one time.  Yes MUCH easier said than done I'm sure.

The closest I came was when I got a CT Scan with contrast.  Basically they inject this dye into your arm that flows thru your veins/arteries so the radiologist can see your blood flow and how functional your organs are etc.  So they hook me up and the technician tells me ""when the dye hits your going to feel pretty warm like your in a blanket, and very warm in your groin you'll feel like you pissed your pants"".  Once it hit I said ""Damn wow, I'm guessing this is what shooting H must be like!?""  Needless to say he looked at me like I had 3 heads and didn't find my comparison funny.

Any tips on how you got a good new connect? 
so I'm from ____ east coast powder last year was getting GOOD stuff that I could always just do 2-4 bags and it was always consistent and great, same stamps, great rush, etc. ever since I lost that connect I have yet to find a consistent connect with good shit. 

So today I wait TWO FUCKING hours for dboy to get his shit together while I'm sick, I finally do my shot and NO FUCKING RUSH. Got me well at least... but what the fuck?

I get high for the rush. I chase the rush. I like heroin, not fentanyl, morphine, real fuego montega ya know? I feel like the dope game is over. People always say like ""oh this shits banging"" yeah right sure... that's what they all say. 
This ""heroin"" I bought has no legs, but worst of all no rush. What the fuck did I buy? 

I'm just so frustrated, everything I've been getting is straight garbage or cut with fentanyl.  Anyone else feel this way? Like real heroin with a real heroin rush and good legs is like finding a needle in a haystack for me. I'm so over this dope game. Spending half my life sick, waiting in my car for the dboy knowing it's prob garbage. 

LONG STORY SHORT: just needed to vent. I want real heroin with a REAL HEROIN rush none of this BS. I feel like my dope game is beat and I should just get out. I'm a sad junkie. And idk how to find a good new connect that isn't the same old fentanyl garbage or whatever the hell I bought today. Urgh. Junkie Jesus please bless me.

Goodbye to my life of sin, hello, let my new life begin,

I'll put down my needle and I'll put down my razor,

No more blood pouring out of my arm,

No more mutilation or self harm,

Forget about suicide and let the dark thoughts subside,

Soon I'll find a reason and learn to get by,

If not for me I'll do it for you,

 But it's to myself I'll always stay true,

So be for I poke my arm and register blood,

I'll think about life before the cheap rush,

Before the dope, the coke and having no hope,

I'll think of the smiles, the laughs and the fun,

Before the withdrawals, the tears and life on the run,

Weather you ran from the law, your problems or troubles,

Just put it behind you and try to stay humble,

You've made it this far and you should be proud,

When you stand with others you'll be the strongest in that crowd,

For we've walked threw the dark depths of hell,

We've crawled out from rock bottom and got up after we fell,

So keep on the right track and don't ever fall back,

In her 50s my mother had a back surgery to deal with  lower lumbar fusion. She has nerve damage and chronic pain and for the last 15 years it has been managed with medicinal marijuana (legal in our location) prescription opiates, physical therapy, epidural and steroid injections, and a tens unit. All of these things have had varying degrees of success.

Despite an extreme amount of management, I can see that she is losing the will to live. The constant chronic pain is either getting worse with age OR her tolerance to her prescription for norco (10mg 4x daily) is growing, OR both.

I told her to try to gain a prescription for more pills monthly but at her last Drs appointment (3 days ago) she told me she chickened out. Supposedly she gets the maximum prescription she can before any more would subject her to some sort of aggressive oversight. As an intensely private person, the thought of being monitored closely seems to be a straw too many for her. She is in agony, but unwilling to seek further assistance (more pills) and no other treatments seem to offer release. 

I am at a loss. I am watching her wither in agony. She told me point blank she doesn't want to live anymore. I feel like I have to convince her to at least *try* subjecting herself to the increased oversight combined with a higher prescription before picking a more final solution.

I am also suffering the idea of trying to score additional pills for her on the black market, but every time I think about how to go about this, I envision myself carrying my 6 month old over to a social worker before getting into a cop car, all the while trying to plead my case ""They aren't for me! Test me! They're for my pitiable mother who has a prescription that DOESN'T PROVIDE ENOUGH RELIEF! Me even being here is proof we have a stupid system! Blah blah blah."" On dead ears.

So, is anyone in California prescribed more than 110 norco pills at 10mg monthly and currently in the more heavily monitored category? How undignified is it? Can I hear your experiences to help sell it as an alternative to suicide for my mother?

Any other advice?

For me, moving isn't just about getting away from my deep connection in the dope game, that doesn't work, it's about getting away from this nyc rat race lifestyle and career path that paired with a long streak of bad decisions is eating me alive. Emphasis on the bad decisions though, without those I think my life here, both professional and social, would be excellent. But it's not, so fuck it, I know I need a fresh start. 

To discuss using real quick first though. I've posted some significant entries about my situation, maybe you remember or will read. Straight up though, I have significant clean streaks this year, the knowledge of addiction gained from an IOP and a desire to stay clean but my life is such trash right now I can't commit to abstaining from my love, cheap fire north jers ecp bundles, completely. I scoop about once a week, use for a couple days then get clean for a week and then repeat. Sometimes clean longer rarely shorter. Right now, coming off an amazing vacation where I only used the first few days, I'm on day 4 clean. My detox is simple these days with my limited use, I'm already feeling good. I know how to manage my minor WDs and stop using no problem, nothing like coming off a long daily habit thank god, but as we all know it's STAYING CLEAN that is the toughest part. 

Staying clean is fucked completely for me in my current situation. Can you relate? I have a solid game plan that I need to start following to properly address my addiction and get a fresh start in life. I'm young enough, smart enough, experienced enough and educated about my addiction enough to do this. Anyone else plan out and execute major lifestyle changes to beat this thing and start over in life? I'll post my plan separately sometime soon to discuss the steps I envision but I'm looking for some experience, strength and hope from someone who's done it for now. Love ya fam.

Well I have to say my few days off the wagon turned into about a month and a week or so.  Oddly enough I still only have to take 1mg of my prescribed suboxone to not be in W/Ds so going off the wagon didn't hurt my hopefully eventual taper off/ sub tolerance.  I think I got the full dope experience in one month too.  1.  totally got ripped off by some fucker selling benadryl  2.  Got fire shit that felt like the first time  3.  Got so high I fell out and smacked my elbow on my solid wood table 4.  Missed my last shot of dope (only once miss though, and I had money to reup) 5.  Made some good connects for next relapse 6.  sketched out some family members 7. lost my phone at work while high so I had to get a new one (after 3 weeks of being missing I pay my 200 dollar deposit to get my new one and the day I get it, someone finds it at work.)but had to rely on weird communication methods to get a hold of dboy 8. last but not least somebody I met during my bender went to rehab!  As much as I loved getting fucking obliterated for a bit I'm glad I'm lucky enough to have suboxone to transition back into sober person life.  If it wasn't for my insurance fucking me with my subs in the first place I may have not went back to dope for this month in the first place so I don't know if I'm actually lucky or not.  Hopefully I can taper off the last 1mg and start taking 0mg a day and finally be done with it.  I think what I'll do is taper off on my own and get a few more months of subs filled just in case I wanna have a little dope break again.  Atleast I didn't ruin my life this time around.

Anyways onto part two of this post.  Now, other 2 or 3 time, I've never really shot up pills.  My opiate progression was weed, methadone, roxy/dilly/opana (snort and oral), then shooting dope so I've never really banged pills before so I'm not as familiar with the preparation/way it feels when you do it.  How do you guys get rid of those crazy ass binders that make your chest hurt when you bang?  Reason I'm asking.....well I kinda tried to shoot some suboxone strips after 40 hrs of no dope as a sort of last hurra! then get back on the wagon.  I currently have 8mg (2 4mg strips) disolved in about 150 units of water in a spoon.  I haven't applied any heat.  My syringe only holds 50 units so the plan was suck up 50 through a cotton, then push it out onto another spoon.  then suck it through one more fresh cotton (still no heat applied in this stage).  Well I went ahead and banged 50 of it and I have to say, it felt weird, like... I caught a buzz and every thing but I just had these weird chests pains and my arms just felt weird.  Am I not getting enough of the binders out or is this to be expected when you shoot a strip/pill/stuff with binders.  Before somebody says ""shooting pills and a strip are totally different"" I understand that,  it's just the only thing I can compare this feeling to with the few times I've banged a pill before.  Anyways  I'm sitting with this spoon of dissolved suboxone just laying around and don't really know what to do with it.  Think it'd be alright to bang?  any advice to filter more bad shit out?",1480834867.0

Yesterday, my sweet, sweet boyfriend and I woke up, determined to do well. We had sub strips, and I started with 2mg, ended up totally fine in the sense that it had been long enough since my last use. Induction day is always hard, so we start at 2mg at a time and work our way up. He ended up taking 4mg at once, eager to be well and thinking we were safe because I'd used the 2mg and we had last used drugs together, and we sent him into terrifying precipitated withdrawal. Holy shit, I felt SO bad for him. I had it happen to me a few weeks back, and it is not a drill. Pure misery.

Anyway, while he's crying/begging/basically shitting himself/he is dead, he's begging me to help, and I start racking my brain for wtf fixed precipitated. ""Wait, DOPE. DOPE DOES,"" so now we're literally running to get in the car before I can even say another word, me in a tiny dress while it's 30 degrees outside, no coat, just because of my crazy empathy button breaking for my babe. I hardly put shoes on. We jump in the car and we start driving AN HOUR+ to the city where we can cop.

We're more than halfway there when I realize that u/hyper_junkie yelling at me (unintentionally) to move faster has fucked us because holy shit, I'm such an idiot, I left my debit card. And there's no going home. I'm 21, I live with my mama, and I had no idea what to say when we left besides that we were going to the grocery store?! Cringe. We are 100% fucked. We realize the only thing we can do at this point is open up Hype a bank account to transfer money into (I lost my ID on a plane last week), while he's just sweating bullets. This day is fun, so far. I'm not well yet, because I've only taken 2mg sublingually, and the whole thing is a shit show.

Long story short, because we just moved here, Hype doesn't have proof of address and CAN'T open a bank account. Both of our IDs are from out of state, and we're screwed. I don't know my debit card number for western union. My adoring mother calls me and tells me that, ""weird, she's AT the grocery store,"" and, ""I am nowhere to be found."" Of course not. I'm an hour away.

Long story short, three people try to open up THREE bank accounts for this, everyone gets denied. I have to admit where I am to an extent, because I'm not just going to let my mom sit there, and holy shit, she is pissed. Trust broken. Rock bottom moment, for sure. The only thing left to do is turn around and go home.

Today comes, and the plug (another couple) says they deliver sometimes, and that if I just WU them money, they'll drop stuff off to me tonight on their way home from their family's house in bum fucked Egypt. At this point, for whatever reason the suboxone is not holding me AT ALL, and I've been sick since yesterday morning around 8am. It's tonight. It's 7pm. Fuck yeah, I trust you, take the money. I've dealt with them before, they are fellow redditors, they wouldn't screw this up.

Well, guys, it's almost 8:00 and I can't get ahold of them. Their thing started at 3:00, their phones are wifi based so they said they'd text me when they were there and when they were leaving (at 11am this morning), and nothing. Can't get them to pick up the phone. I'm praying the wifi is down at their fambam's, but we all know they burnt me. It's cool. We'll just say it. I'm fucked. Poor D is fucked.

Anyway, 48 hours into withdrawal, and it's so fun. I keep throwing myself between the hot tub and outdoor 15 degree weather, I am a complete sobbing mess because withdrawals do that, and on top of it, I feel so terrible for making my mom upset. I freaked out and had no idea what to do, guess I've just made a bunch of poor choices. I'm giving up on slapping sub under my tongue because it isn't working for whatever reason, and I'm just going to curl up and beg for death. Hours aren't passing.

I hope you guys are having a better night than I am. I'm not even sure how my iPhone worked to type this with such fucking sweaty hands. I'm out of money because I didn't want to upset my mom by leaving over the next few days, after yesterday, so I gave unnnamed dealer couple everything I had. Wallet is empty. Heart is broken. Bring on the horror stories. Make me feel better, because I really just want to die. Over and out.

So I slap it out. Hard. On my crotch.

It didn't go out but rather it jumped off my sweat pants and landed on my fooot, slightly singeing it.

So that's how I punched my dick and burned my foot. I ended up finishing the smoke tho so it's all good.

This is a total shit in the dark, and Im pulling teeth here reaching out to complete strangers asking for help, words of wisdom, maybe a little guidance. Have you ever felt hopeless? I feel sick to my stomach and my heart hurts as if a thousand pounds has just been dropped on me. Im 23 years old and have wasted a good 7 years of my life being an addict. Ive had my mom drive me to a rehab and once I got there I bugged out, started crying, and told her to take me home. Had my poor mother who hasnt spoke to me in 4 years get her hopes up that I was getting help for her to lose all hope once again and waste her time. What is wrong with me? I want to get clean, give it a shot, at least fucking try. But for some reason, I cant. I dont. Im standing in my own fucking way and my feet are stuck on the ground, they wont move for anything. Not even my dead dads voice in the back of my head sobbing to have his daughter back makes my feet move one in front of the other. My heart and soul tell me to just try, while my mind keeps racing, telling me to run! Run far, far away! Far from any help that can be given to me. Why? Shit, I dont know. I have been to treatment more than enough times, Ive tried moving miles away to other states to ""start over,"" Ive tried suboxone maintenance, Ive been to jail numerous times, Ive OD'd once, Ive almost lost both arms for using dirty needles, Ive been homeless, Ive slept with strange men, Ive lost touch with my family, my father just died... and I sit here, in tears, on the verge of puking, asking myself ""Whats it gonna take?"" Its a never-ending constant battle with myself. I look around at other recovering addicts and wonder how they make it look so fucking easy. How did they know enough was enough? Im sure they have had to feel the same way I do at one point or another; wanting to want to get clean. Really wanting a better life but doing absolutely nothing about it cuz your head wont let you. My heart wants one thing and my head wants another. So what was it? How did you take that leap of faith into recovery? When did you get so sick of living this way that you started fighting for your life back? Im sitting here thinking if I should just shoot myself in the head. Easy way out. Finally put an end with this battle that Im nowhere near winning. I cant express enough how much I hate myself for being this way. Im literally sick to my stomach. So I ask you, what should I do? Any insight? Suggestions? Dont get me wrong, I know what I need to do, but I cant. Does this even make any sense? Am I making sense anymore? I need to turn right, but my body turns left. Gotta make lemonade but instead I pick up the damn grapes. Need to surrender, but I put up a fight. A fight I cant win. A fight that has literally taken every single thing I love. A fight that has beaten me up so badly... and what do I do? Instead of surrendering and getting some help, Im still trying to swing with no breath left in me. Wanting to give up and give in, to relax, restore my sanity, faith, hope, and health. Smile at the sun, feel the peace within the breeze, ignite hope where the snow melts. Yet all I do is run away from it. Frown when I try to smile, feel afraid when peace is nearby. Destroy all hope by the overwhelming stench of hopelessness. I cling and chase towards the brighter side of things, but these feet, they stand here, stuck to this awful muddy ground, and every time I try to take a step in the better direction, I slip and slide back to ground zero. Am I making sense? I tend to not make much sense when I havent had any dope in a good 7-8hrs. Idk, Im lost and Im not asking for any sympathy whatsoever. Im asking for anyone who knows what it feels like to shed some light over here to me, someone who's been stuck in the dark for way too long. I know there's light, I can feel it inside my soul, I can hear it through others, I cacn see it but cant touch it. I can admire it from afar but my hands wont let me grip it up and hold it tight. Whats wrong with me? Why me? Why am I stuck in my own hell and cant seem to climb out? Lost in my own ways, the Devil stays....

This hell will kill me. My head will be the death of me. My head is what got me in this mess in the first place. Along with my heart following the wrong things. My lungs breathing in toxic air. My stomach craving to make problems disappear, vanish. Followed by my legs walking in the wrong direction, to now.. here.. where my feet are stuck right here IN HELL... knee-deep in flames, consumed by fire. Inspired by the devils desire.

And now my shit has arrived so goodbye :) ",1480812731.0

5gbey6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5gbey6/i_fucked_up/,15,https://redd.it/5gbey6,hazedintheAK,I fucked up.,"I have been dealing with my cycle of opiate addiction for about 6 years now. I have been a member of r/opies pretty much since the beginning when jmkogut was a mod. Gone by a few different usernames. Recently, I relapsed off off having 2 and a half years clean and binged for about 3 months before my main plug left town for a few days because of serious heat in my city. When that happened, everyone around me noticed what was going on because of how sick I was, and agreed to go to rehab. I paid for rehab this time because I hate this shit. I drained my savings to get better and go to a 30 day outpatient program that does a special IV infusion for 10 days during detox, with therapy and other stuff. After the first ten days it's just therapy and other activities. This was the second time I'd be doing something like this cause it worked before, 3 years ago.

 They prescribed me gabapentin in detox. They administered it everyday while I was there but when I left, they prescribed me a 30 day supply. 600mg , 3 times a day. Well, long story short, I abuse the gaba script I got and use it in about a week and a half. I guess because of the amount of gabapentin I was using everyday, on top of the regular dose I had been on for 2 weeks prior, it sent me into gabapentin withdrawals. I had no idea you even got physical withdrawals from gabapentin or else I wouldn't have taken nearly as many as I did. My doctor said if I was feeling uncomfortable I could always take more because the drug is relatively harmless.  I had been 22 days clean at this point. The last thing I wanted to do was go through withdrawal from something again. 

  I didn't know what to do, I was in a lot of pain because for me gaba w/d feels like your arms and legs are on fire, on top of being sweaty, anxious and just downright feeling like crap. I took some aleve, drank a few beers, even smoked pot which I'm not supposed to be doing either, and I still felt like shit. I had to work that night and I couldn't call off cause I had literally just taken 2 weeks off so I could detox. I also had requested off 5 days in the beginning of December for a trip I need to go on.

  Being the piece of shit junkie I am, I went and copped. I got the lowest amount my dude sells which is a half g. I just did a little bit to get well. It ended up getting me blasted. I tried to finish up the sack as quick as I could but I also didn't want to OD. It literally took me 4 days to finish the half. I tried to put it down so it wouldn't be 4 days straight but I mean, we all know how it is, when you have some strong dope, it's hard not to indulge. After I ran out mid day on Wednesday, which would have been day 5 of using, I didn't go get anymore. Withdrawal started rolling in around 8 at night, last time I had used was 1pm. I didn't feel the gabapentin withdrawal as much, more of a weaker but still strong opiate withdrawal. Mainly sweats, coughing, sneezing (didn't help that I had a mild sinus infection at the time) , mild RLS, and headache. Some of it could have been gabapentin w/d as well though I'm just not used to that. 

   Today is Saturday and I just got off the phone with my therapist because yesterday they had me pee and I obviously failed for opiates and weed. I'm going in to talk to her and also take another test tomorrow. 

   Besides all of this I have a trip planned to go to another state with a close friend(who has been very on board with trying to get me clean) and my mom to visit my dad and attend his company Christmas party. As of right now, I'm looking to be dopesick on the trip(everyone with me will know right away) unless I can find subs because I am flying domestically. The other part of it is that I'm just sick of this shit, i didn't even want to relapse. I wouldn't have if I didn't fuck up and take way too many gaba's. I was doing good mentally and feeling good physically. Maybe this just a huge excuse but I wouldn't have been able to function at my work that night or the next 3 days after that. 

  I just feel like an overall piece of shit pretty much and feel like I threw away my money and my sobriety in the matter of like a half hour. I forgot to mention that I also decided to break things off with my gf of 5 and a half years because there are many times when I find myself trying to escape the stress of our relationship and also she doesn't do drugs, and doesn't need to deal with my bullshit when she is dealing with anorexia and is in grad school at the moment. When I quit dealing and got clean 3 years ago I told myself I would never get involved with this shit again, especially after going down the road of hustling around a half zip of ron every few days just to keep my habit going. I should be in jail.  I'm sorry if this seems like a mindless rant as well. I don't even know if I'm asking for advice or not. Just in a very weird place right now. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest even if it's just to a bunch of strangers on the interwebs.

Feel free to PM if you interested in my sad life, just want to talk, or need some motivating words. I am a very open person. 
 TLDR: I used after 21 days cause of gabapentin withdrawal and I feel like shit for it. Before that I relapsed and binged for 3 months after 2 and a half years clean.",1480795412.0

I know for a fact if i could make it into the air force i would never use again. My question is how long should i quit for before going in. I was thinking i would quit about a month beforehand and i would be alright. I would just like other peoples opinions on how long i should give it. I know that once i was in bootcamp that everything would be structured and i would be watched all the time. I know that you can get drugs while in the military, but they do have random testing so that would scare me enough for me to stay away. My dad is about to hit 20 years and is going to retire out. Everyone would know that i was his son so i for sure would be a huge disappointment to be thrown out over drugs. Trust me that disappointment will keep me clean.

Monday morning and down to my last few fent patches, payday so I was sat home messaging a few people and got no replys or bad news. Feeling sorry for myself I headed over to the shop to get a bag of Roundtrees randoms, and a jolly rancher.

Outside the shop I see a 40 odd year old guy in a big coat, pajama bottoms and some trainers. Jackpot. He asked me for £1 to use the phone. so I help him out and ask if he can help me out to get some gear. Surprise surprise that's what the pound was for. We make our way back to his house. I walk in and his mum who's about 70 is sat with a skinny girl who looked like clamps from futurama.

He calls the guy up from clamps phone, and within 5 minutes he's here. I buy myself 6 bags and buy him 2 and throw him a box of cigs for being so friendly and helpful. That's when shit gets weird. 
Clamps bust out a bag of rock, sets her pipe up.. but puts it on the side and doesn't smoke. Grandma walks back in with a cup of tea for us all. Sits down and proceeds to pick the pipe up. I watched a little old lady hit that rock like a fucking champ. 

I do a bag, have a nice cup of tea and on my way with a new connect and the vision of a little old lady smoking crack like a boss. 
This game is fucked.

Stay safe out there and happy nods. I was lucky here, if your going to try cold cop never let the money leave your hand.

TL:DR cold copped, better gear better price and got to see somebody's grandma smoke crack like Charlie sheen.

I have had chronic pain my entire life. Was discomfort for years and slowly ramped up to knock me on my ass when I was 17. Horrible pain all over my body that made me want to end it all, and the beginnings of nerve pain in my face. I couldn't walk or stand due to what I know now are muscle spasms. Had to be homeschooled my senior year, fell out of touch with almost all my friends and didn't go to prom. Found weed around this time and found the motivation not to kill myself in the plant, and never put it down. By this point I'd seen every kind of doctor under the sun, went through literally every single specialist at two university hospitals, and been on a host of horrible and painful rheumatological treatments. And nothing changed, just kept getting worse. This is where the inactivity started, the thing I most regret. So I laid down for the next two years essentially, getting up to get food and go to my lessening classes and avoid everything else. Depression hit hard, suicidal thoughts started to torment me again, and with nowhere else to turn I reluctantly went to a pain center. I was very against painkillers because at the time I was going to school for pharmacology and addiction medicine, and my mother agreed that starting an 18 year old on painkillers when he has had pain his whole life is a bad move long term. So they tried muscle relaxants and gabapentin. The muscle relaxants needed to be increased to 60mg Flexeril a day before they made any difference. And they did, but not before turning me dumb and numb. I looked stoned out of my mind that first semester of college. And to be fair, I was, slamming edibles like they were water every second of every day because that's all I had to cope. With no improvement aside from the chronic and severe muscle spasms contorting my spine slightly less, they put me on hydrocodone.   

  
I threw up every single pill of the first script, and by the second script when I could actually keep a few down, I felt like I wasn't even awake. I would wake up, take GABA and Flexeril and hydro first thing, and either fall asleep with an hour, or stumble to class basically asleep anyway. This is where the memory issues start, I genuinely can't remember a large portion of this period. From hydro they went to oxy, and I was a blubbering mess. Screaming at professors for no reason and talking loudly during class to no one in particular, drooling on myself as I nodded out. But hey, I was present right? I was moving, attending classes, and doctors were more than happy. At this point I started to realize I never was out of pain before I was out of this world. I've smoked a lot of pot (vaporized really) and dabbed a lot of hash oil, taken breaks, so I know what getting high is. Painkillers don't just get you high, they get you out of this world. So when the nausea became a huge issue the doctor had the bright idea to switch me from 15mg oxy to a 25ug fentanyl patch. I put the patch on before bed and woke up shaking and vomiting. This was the worst experience I've ever had with opiates, I couldn't stop throwing up for hours after that patch came off. So we switched to morphine. Ramped up to 90mg extended release a day, the ""legal limit"". I was on opiates for a total of 1 year and 3 months. Towards the end I started to fight back and exercise heavily, finally making some progress against this miserable pain. My doctor was more than fine with the pot always being in my urine, even wrote me an unofficial recommendation (""medical marijuana"" written on a prescription pad, idiot) for medical marijuana because he didn't want to become a provider himself. Then one day out of the blue, ""yeah so we can't continue to give you morphine when you test positive for marijuana"". I was floored and angry, but at the same time incredibly relieved. 10 days to taper in the middle of my semester. When the taper started i immediately realized I was not going to be able to attend classes or get out of bed for that matter, so I accelerated the taper to 5 days and endured hell. When the physical withdrawls ended, the first thing I did was order Kratom and start to take it first every three days, then they other day, then daily, always leaving at least one day without it every three days. Still doses always, still getting fucked and completely stoned from 2g, so I aimed to take once a day. Some days needed three times a day just to attend classes though. Then something I didn't expect happened, I went three days without it and was thrown back into withdrawls. How? This plant is safe and not addictive? Like coffee? WDs are like a cold, not like opiates. So I've spent the last month, as a 19 year old, fighting between miserable pain and horrible intoxicating Kratom capsules, supplimenting with CBD crystals when I can stand it and avoiding THC completely. I was so happy that I was able to go yesterday without any Kratom, but today I woke up in horrible pain and had to take it or else miss class. So what is it? Am I addicted? Does taking exactly as written and never once abusing these drugs still leave me with room to be physically and psychologically dependant on opiates? Yes, the answer is yes. Should I endure the misery to stay clean? I don't know. Does Kratom get me high as fuck? Absolutely yes. Is the pain worse than the drugs? Almost always. Do I hate being alive? Without a doubt. Do I wish they'd never given me opiates? Almost every day. Do they help the pain? Yes, but not before fucking my head. What the hell am I supposed to do? I know I need to finish two more weeks and then I have the break to try and get off this shit for good. I miss being fully awake. I've thorn away my education being stoned of my mind and failing the second they put me on the medicine. I used to do well and had high hopes. Now I'll be lucky if I finish college, pharma school isn't an option. I hate medication. I fucking hate that I was born into this world in pain. I am so beyond angry at the world and there is no one to blame.  ",1480940908.0

So, I have been a dope addict for 5 months, I am heavy intranasal user (~1.5/2gs per day) and I have been cutting down a lot over the last week in preparation for w/d. I have a couple of 8mg subs and I would like to use subs only so long as I need them while I'm detoxing from heroin. I do not want to be on subs long term. My plan is to dose as follows: 

-Take last dose -> wait 24-48 hours or until I exhibit mild-moderate withdrawal symptoms  
Day 1:
- 4mg first dose
- 2mg - wait 4 hours
- 2mg - wait 4 hours
- 2mg - wait 4 hours   
 Day 2:
- 2 mg wait 6 hours
- 2 mg wait 6 hours
- 2 mg wait 6 hours      
 Day 3: 
- 2mg wait 8 hours
- 2mg wait 8 hours     
Day 4: 2 mg no more than 24 hours since previous dose
Day 5: 1 mg <24 hours since previous dose 
Day 6: .5 mg
Day 7: maybe take .25 mg, maybe not, idk?

What do you guys think of this plan? Do you think I won't experience any withdrawal symptoms from either the dope and the subs? My ultimate goal is to come out of this week completely off all substances, because I am going on a 3 week long vacation in another country over the holidays and I won't be able to take any opiates/subs with me. Is this plan safe? Should I taper more for longer? 

P.S. I already know I shouldn't be taking subs w/o the supervision of a doctor but I am willing to take the risk and do it on my own. However I would love to minimize the risks I'm taking by enlisting some advice from some of you lovely redditors on this sub :) thanks!",1480939285.0

I know that, for some bizarre reason, a lot of opiate users actually *enjoy* this feeling. I don't understand why. I'm sitting here, right now, wanting to play and enjoy Final Fantasy XV under the peaceful, euphoric buzz of the third of a Subutex I took, but I can't leave the pause screen because I can't stop nodding off.

See, that's why *I* **don't** like nodding, because I'm usually trying to play a videogame or watch TV or something while I'm enjoying my buzz, and I can't do that if I'm nodding out. When people say they like the nods, I picture them just sitting there in an empty room after they've taken their meds and doing absolutely nothing, because how can you enjoy anything while you're fighting to keep your eyes open?

Also, another reason I don't like nodding is, if it overpowers me and I end up falling asleep, then that's a waste of the buzz from whatever I've taken. After all, you can't feel or enjoy a buzz while you're zzz.

So, yeah, I guess if you like staring at a wall while waiting for your eyelids to get heavy so you can fall asleep and waste a $40 pill, then nodding is definitely for you! ;D

Of course, I'm meaning no offense to anybody. Anyway, is there a better way to stop nodding, other than splashing cold water on your face? That's literally the only method I know, and I need a better one.",1480914702.0

We've been friends since before 1st grade tho, so i figure wtf he's here, we're partying, i'll break him off). We get back to my house, bring in the shit we got from the store and i go to sit on the computer and he's standing off to the side smoking a cig and we're bullshitting. Out of nowhere his eyes glaze over and he drops like a bag of bricks, goes completely unresponsive. I know what's happening from the jump but have to play dumb so the other people in my house won't know. I call 911 and the police show up before the ambulance. Cop takes one look and goes 'How long has he been doing heroin', proceeds to interrogate me, the whole time i'm playing dumb and he's administrating two doses of the nasal spray narcan shit. Paramedics and two more cops show up and all immediately go to 'Yep its heroin'. 

Stupid me didn't realize i had a little tupperware container type thing i keep my tree's in sitting on the desk like 5 feet from my OD'ing friend and the one cop notices it. Proceed to grill me, my father, my wife and my friend once he starts coming around a little and search my whole house. Since i'm a dirty/lazy junkie they find a bunch of old straws, plastic baggies and little paper envelopes in my bedroom closet and start talking about child endangerment charges (my son was in bed in his bedroom and is in 0 actual danger). I end up fessing up to the shit in the room and the weed so they don't take me and my wife to jail and get cuffed, stuffed in the back of the cruiser. 

I Explain to the cop that my family needs me, my wife is disabled as is my father and i'm the only one bringing any money into the house. He makes me sit in the cruiser and says it's up to his supervisor if they take my kid for child endangerment and throw me in jail or not. Eventually they lead my buddy to the ambulance that's waiting and come let me out of the back of the cruiser. After talking a bunch of shit and telling me in 30 days i better of gotten clean and be able to prove i went to rehab or something like that/be able to pass a piss test and making it clear he's not joking and hes' 'def coming back' they uncuff me and go to leave. On his way out he stresses he's coming back and if i'm not clean/can show him i'm clean then he's gonna charge me w/ the half a gram and paraphenelia that they found and took.

TLDR: friend fell out, cops and ambulance came to my house, found drugs and paraphanelia and i'm lucky to not be in a jail cell.

Anyone know the law in ohio and know if they can come back 30 days from now and charge me with shit they found/took today but didn't charge me with? Can they charge me with anything they found when it's responding to an OD call / does anyone have any idea how (if there are any) good samaritan laws work in ohio?

Was clean for 3 years until July when I got my wisdom teeth out and was written a Vicodin script. Abused the fuck out of it right off the bat, didn't even try not to. Moved away in hopes of a fresh start, met a boy who rocked my world but also proved to be one hell of a dealer. He's a junkie. Poly drug use galore. We fed off of each other. It was a crazy couple months before he ended up in jail for weed. Watching him get arrested and seeing him sick behind bullet proof glad scared the shit out of me. I dropped everything right then. Been clean for 40 days now but I feel so alone. Coping with my best friend in the whole world being gone is hard and I want nothing more than to nod again. I don't trust myself. I know I should move away again, as drugs are way too readily available here. But I can't bring myself to leave my friend behind even if I can't see him. I'm depressed, lonely, scared, idk.

My main hookup's name is, let's call her, Stephanie. She's usually pretty reliable and has basically a little of everything. But the best part is her house is straight up like a drive thru service. There's this bathroom window on the front of the house covered by a big rollout thing, it just slides open and we swap and done. She will even sometimes leave stuff out for me if she has to leave and she trusts me enough not to rip her off. And its not like we've hungout ever or anything.

There was this one guy in the hood that I used to buy coke from. He made me hangout with him for at least an hour. He was this white 45ish year old guy that just lived by the bay and was super cool. He was like the sketchy dad I never had. He'd always tell me to text him when I got back home safe.

Skip to bottom if uninterested and please answer question.] Hey folks! Been a while since Iv'e tampered with any sort of drug. Been in NA for a while, only because of weed though. People say you can't really get addicted, but I dont know what else you'd call it when it's the only thing in the world you want or think about and it completely consumes you. So yeah, i have an addictive personality and dipping back into this is probably a bad idea. But last night everything built up then caved in on me and I had my second massive panic attack. 

Home alone, screamed tore my shirt off, ripped the curtaina off the wall, started cutting my tongue, broke some shit. I was able to come down from this though because I chewed five of my moms .5 mg anti anxiety pills. Pretty much knocked me out. 

Now all i can think of is wanting more, so i hit up a few if my friends and only got one plug. 5 pills of 5mg oxiCODON for 25 bucks. Now, tomorrow I also have a meeting tomorrow with my parents, all teachers, and school councelor. Over the weekend I did nearly all the outstanding work I need to do, so I am anticipating the meeting going well. 

[Question] For a first time user, would it be unwise to take 5mg of oxiCODON around 4 hours before an important meeting with my school councelor, all my teachers, and my parents? Will i be visually under the influence? Any ither advice is aporeciated.

Ive had 5 days clean, then relapsed for 3 then clean for 6 and have been using the last 5 days.  

So i have to drop off addys at my dealers house doing him a favor.  On my way i do the last half of the opana 40, so about 20 mg give or take.  That was at about 420.  I get to his house about 5 were BSing and he throws me a few blues, awesome.  So its now 515 and i blow a 30.  Right away i felt it all the way in the back of my brain, almost like the oxy powder went up my nose and latched to the back right part of my brain.  It gave me a satisfying and serious rush for probably close to 30 seconds.  As the rush starts to subside, it still feels like this oxy powder is just coating the back right part of my brain, but it wasnt very satisfying.  I start go feel jittery, out of breathe, and a little out of it.  I feel the need to walk outside his garage into the freezing cold and pace.  He asks if im ok I explained i took the opana, take a redbull from his fridge and tell him im heading out.  I could tell he was a little worried about me and wanted me to stay but I felt like i couldnt sit still.

I usually have a solid tolerance, but since getting ""clean"", ive been getting pretty wrecked the last week and a half.  For some reason i thought i had done that opana hours earlier but it had been less than an hr between that and the roxy.  Knowing my tolerance was weaker than usual normally id have done half the blue and went from there. 

Well once i started driving my heart was racing and my neck heart, shoulder, and stomach started to feel really tight.  It would get a little better but then right away right back to those symptoms full force.  Then my head and body started shaking/shivering?  And i fet my breathing becoming shallow, so every now and then id take deeper than normal breathes.  I had the window down because i thought that would help keep me up if o started nodding which i wasnt and the crisp air felt better in my lungs.  This went on the whole 45 minutes home while i debated driving to a hospital (no insurance) so i really didnt want to do that and probably wouldnt have regardless.  My next thought was buyinh narcan at a cvs by my house.  Ive never OD'd in my 9 yrs a junkie and this was the closest ive ever been I think.  So im freaking out the whole way home, i finally pull of the exit about 10 minutes from CVS and ultimately narcan.  Out of nowhere i started to feel normal, the shaking subsided and the heart palpitations stopped, and the tightness in my body and heart went away.  I went and bought Haggen Daas instead.

I was legitimately nervous.  My question is from the sound of these symptoms does it sound like I was on the brink of an OD?  And about how long after insufflating an opiate, oxy or otherwise, does it take to OD?  

I realize driving during this ordeal was probably not smart, but it was like i refused to believe this was happening.  Maybe im just overreacting, but that's why im here asking my people.

So, anyway, this past month I've been staying with my parents trying to get clean. But a dealer phoned me and said 'can I use your appartment if you're not in it'. Okay, whats in it for me? 2 bags a day. No hesitation, I gave him my keys and he set up a runner in there. I'd make some bullshit excuse to go out into town (I've given all my cards, money and phone to my parents to convince them I'm trying - which I was, I'm actually nearly 2 weeks clean - although that might have something to do with the fact they dragged me down to the South Coast to a little holiday house they have away from everyone I know.. I digress) Anyway, while I was back there, I'd make my excuses and go back to my place, see the guy, get a couple and go back again - round trip less than 10 minutes. Great. Now, while I am here getting clean, I get a call from the guy saying his runner can't be contacted and has disappeared. Now, either he's done a runner with the drugs, or been arrested. Either outside my place, or the neighbours have noticed his comings and goings and called the police. If the first one is true, then he'd been picked up - leaving potentially a SHIT load of stuff at my place. If the second is true, then they've busted into my place and its gone - and I may potentially be in trouble. I have no idea.. I'm going back tomorrow to find out, but.. I don't know if I can be linked to this. I just lent a guy some keys to borrow my place while i'm not there. Discussing this on the internet probably isn't smart, but I just wanted to say - I'm either in for a jackpot (can say the police came and took it all) or I'm fucked. Rock on homies.. I'll let you know in 24 hours - your guess is as good as mine.

STORY TIME. PASS GO! SPEND $200 ON DOPE. GO TO JAIL.
  
In the past few days, I've had several texts from the rental agency asking about viewings since I'm moving out of the dump. (I call it a dump, that's generous, the rental agency is a fucking extortion racket. ""We sell medium sized cardboard boxes with the 'interesting feature' that the box is that it is seemingly made from drywall..  ""

Check it! So, I pay £550/CalMonth (~>US$700) for a room that barely fits an undersized single bed, has a closet sized kitchen without space for ANY modern appliances except a half-size fridge that fits one carton of milk and dinner for that day.. if dinner was a candy bar.. wrapper.  
  
There is a shower, but not enough space to lay out a floor mat, the shower curtain takes up too much room to manuever) I'd love to post an image for yous'all to laugh at my predicament, however it's getting to the point where being too honest-for-the-lulz about my life and its heavy association with drugs means the amount of crap I have posted online has the potential (thanks Snowde!) for an AI out there to detect any personal written inflection, slowly link everything together. Everything anybody has posted all linked and protestan AI will have built a profile of everyone online and been able to collate who posted what, uploaded what or clicked anything ever..  even anonymously or proxy or TOR or whatever..)  
  
These texts say there is to be a property viewing 'tomorrow at 3pm' (paraphrasing) by some sucker who wants to live in an incredibly expensive city but has only enough to buy a mop closet to stand in. (Funny, sounds rather like my place!) There isn't even any heating, it's now the dead of winter in this country and the ""kitchen"" window has been hanging off its hinges since I moved in six months ago on a promise they'd fix it - hence me not renewing my contract and simply leaving in a week. By letting the place out, whatever happens, got something out of it and its payback to shitty dealers everywhere that make you wait or fuck you about. He's in there, in a cold, tiny room with nothing but his own mind (No TV, no internet!). I really don't know how they can be allowed to rent this place. You have to sleep in a hat. It's THE definition of barely legal.. but with no boobs, or fun... of any kind.   

  
Anyone that cares to go through a long, potentially expensive court case in order to claim back probably a months rent. I'll happily give you 50/50. Still, after a long legal battle , I **might** be awarded a months rent.. yet, most likely ending up 1/10th of its original value after the Judge waves his magic wand and my compensation becomes fees. i.e the cost of being right, hiring someone to tell the room you're right in a language called 'legaleese' (that takes years to learn).

So, to the outcome of today. I sneak out of my parents place, dash over to my flat to check it out and all my stuff is there. There's no drugs in any of the usual hiding places.. but the place is a *bit* of a mess. There is money EVERYWHERE.. also a lot of McDonalds bags, what look like plastic caps from needles and works, a bowl filled with cigerette ash and various piles of junk everywhere The only thing I'm a bit pissed off at is my HUGE bag of concert tickets that I have collected since I was a kid (I love music, been to multiple concerts every year since forever) is kinda strewn all over the floor, like the few remaining items that were left things have been gone through. If I was to guess, it doesn't look like the runner was here by himself. It really looks like he's had some junkie in shooting up while selling from there. I can't confirm it, but it sure as hell looks like it. The guy still hasn't been found, but he has left the money. There are no 'police notes' stuck to the door saying 'call police now scumbag on the run' etc. Why take the drugs, not the money and disappear? Looks like I'm in the clear, but the disappearance of this guy is an increasing mystery. Will update as, if and when.

All in all.. not quite any of the outcomes I was expecting. Someone in the comments correctly guessed that they might trash the place.. It's really not that bad, but it's not pretty either. So I guess that's it, right? OH... SURE, the money.. Yeah, there's about £8k of foldin' money about and a whole crap ton of loose change hidden inside a KFC chicken burger box. I only had a chance to look at the place before I'd have been gone too long and my parents got suspicious, so I ran back. It's midnight now, if I sneak out around 2am,
 I'll have a chance to clean up a bit. Taking the cash seems like a bad idea, but on the other hand, I haven't got my keys back (I do actually have a spare set - but dBoi doesn't know that. About 10 days ago I went over to buy another bag and watched the guy leave to make a deal round the corner, he didn't see me, so I popped in and eyeballed myself a few grams from the giant pile before slipping out again). 

I hope the outcome wasn't too dull for you. I guess dull is better than cake or death, I didn't die from an OD and I didn't get arrested. I'm NOT pleased with how much of a shit hole mess it is, I'll try and get a couple pictures when I go back and you can get the beautiful double whammy of a wonderous and visionary fusion art piece called 'box sized room + abused drug shit hole'. As long as I can recover all my concert tickets I think that's pretty much anything of sentimental value there. Moneywise.. it doesn't even look counted, its just left all over the floor next to the single bed (specifically, in the area I use to put my feet when I get up each morning).

  
Questions anyone?  

I predict someone will ask if I am mentally impaired...   
The answer is: In anything related to drugs, I am a complete idiot. I'm an addict through and through (I'm ill, basically, I can't help it sometimes. It's like I have no free will) And so, if you've never done anything stupid to get a fix, or haven't been won over by the offer of a decent (when you're broke) amount of free dope for doing literally nothing for a week, then you are some sort of goddamn saint. I don't think it's fair to criticize unless you are either clean and don't understand the power of addiction or you are a junkie with some impeccable moral credentials and/or have never experience withdrawals and the power of the pull to the dark side when you're ill and need that sweet relief.",1480897351.0

He gave me 120 pills for the month, but obviously if I take more than 4 a day I will be short for the month.

But 1 every 4-6 hours a day is 4-6 pills a day.  So is this supposed to be 120 pills max a month or is it okay to run out a few days early?

all these things made me feel the heat leave my body 20 min and feel that cold gross feeling on your upper back when you just wanna hunch over like when you start getting dope sick. Haven't used heroin/fent in prob 3 weeks, haven't used kratom in a couple days. Just did tiny bit of ibogaine and that triggered it, which sucks real bad cause ibogaine usually fixes most isues. 
I have been treated for Lyme disease, this started happening maybe 2 months later, so not sure if that's relevant. It's almost like certain receptors are reading shit backwards or something. I can't get any relief. Luckily gabapentin doesn't appear to do it but that's such a slow come up maybe it does and I just don't notice it. And no I do not believe it's hyperalgesia from what I've read but who knows. Also my primary doc and a suboxone doc I met with just to ask him about this issue didn't know what was up amd seemed pretty clueless in general.

Has anyone ever heard of such a thing or can point me in the right direction? Thank you.",1480890656.0

Didn't touch opiates for a year and a half. This summer I got back into heroin, but only occasional use. As the use did seem to have a steady and alarming build in frequency, I put myself into IOP because I didn't want to go through what I had gone through before. 

Well that was in October, and I've still been using even though I'm I'm treatment. Yes, I understand that's counterproductive and I'm somewhat wasting my time and theirs, but I still feel it helps me a lot, and that's also another subject for another time. I started using again in early October, and would use about 3 points over the course of 1-2 days, then stop for a week. Then I'd do the same, with a 3 or 4 day gap. Lately it's been anywhere from 3-5 points, on top of what my dealer and homies smoke me, with a 2-3 day gap. I saw that it was getting out of my control, so when I used last Wednesday, I decided I needed to prove to myself I could go 4 days clean, and then use Monday. 

Well it was going fine until yesterday, day 3 of no dope. I woke up, and as I started stirring, getting the fog out of my head and actually waking up as a human being, I felt sick. I spent a half hour in my bathroom gagging, but couldn't puke. Then cold sweats. Then the runny nose, the muscle aches. I thought there's no way I could be dope sick, it's been three days and I've been successfully avoiding it, right? Well I decided to validate my suspicion and went and used with my dealer as well as buy some for later that night. As soon as him and I smoked, all my symptoms went away and I felt 10,000 times better. 

So my question is... what the fuck? Withdrawals setting in on day 3? Was it simply a massive coincidence, or did I fuck up my chipping?",1480881554.0

I discovered this by accident. Once upon a time, I had to go have lunch at my grandparents' and I wanted to smoke a joint. And hell, *why not add some dope to it!* - I thought -,  ""We all know sprinkling heroin in a joint doesn't work, it's just like trying to smoke coke in a cigarette.*

That's because, I thought, freebase has a very low boiling point, that's why if you fuck up, you end up burning it on the foil. This is what happened to me, until I started getting a better technique; which is why I'm recommending this technique for people who are in my situation.

Well, since I didn't just want to burn my money, I decided to try some way in which the heroin could be heated but not to the point of burning it. In order to do that, I take a king size rolling paper and I add a *cylinder* of rolling tobacco (I love Drum, it can get very *moist and chunky* which is good for this!), approximately half the amount of what I'd use if I wanted to roll a cigarette with that paper.

I use paper tips and I think it's essential for this to work. **Now here comes the important part!** I place the tip in the paper, and add an extra *chunk* of dense, conglomerated (that's why I like Drum) tobacco and place it right in front of the tip. I leave a little ""void"" between the tip and the rest of the tobacco: **here is where  most of your powder goes**. I add a very thin layer of tobacco in the void, and sort of mix it with the powder (very little tobacco!). 

Then I repeat this in the middle of the tobacco cyllnder, with a little less amount of powder as this will be burnt earlier. On the one I've been smoking right now, I think I put ~30mg in the tip part, and ~10mg in the middle part. Finally I sprinkle the grinded weed (I use sativa strains) all over the tobacco, but not on the parts where your powder is!

Now, my theory is that, as you smoke your joint, the heroin gets heated - not directly from the cherry, because that'd make it burn, but because of the flow of hot air (and, anyways, if the cherry is far enough from the powder it sort of acts like a lighter when you smoke it on foil). That's gonna make it, eventually, vape. Then I feel that I reached the line, which I smoke, but it has a very distinctive taste than heroin vapor. So I know for a fact that it **is** vaporised. 

Usually I will stop at this point. Keep in mind that the most vapor you're getting from the powder located after the tip, because it gets progressively hotter until it starts evaporating.

Some other things I do:

* **Carefully warm the joint** with your lighter set in low-flame, a little bit before lighting it, especially those areas where the powder is. Be careful not to overdo it, though.

* **Take strong hits** when the cherry is still far from the middle or tip powder deposit. This, I suppose, raises their temperature faster. *On the other hand though*... taking several light hits might be better for slowly achieving the evaporation point without burning your stuff. Or maybe light hits don't heat it enough... I go for the big draws at first, and it works!

* **Take light hits** when the cherry approaches the powder. The slower you go, the more hits you're gonna get before it burns.

* **Take breaks** after you reach every line. I think it's good that it cools down a little bit.

Of course, this is **much more wasteful** than smoking on foil (with a proper technique) or using some ideal vaporisation device. However, this still gets me high as fuck. The aforementioned first time I did this, I didn't expect it to work... I ended up not even smoking half the joint, and needing to rush to the WC to puke. That was the first time and only time I've got sick from taking too much.

However, it still works better than snorting. After all #3 is meant to be smoked, but my general ROA is snorting because I believe it works... It's just a different high, this has more than a rush.

Obviously now that I can smoke off foil without wasting as much, I prefer the foil, and I believe so will most of you. But really, this gave me a strong nod a while ago (1/3 of it), but maybe that's because I took my Rx'd 1mg clonazepam and potentiated with hydroxyzine. And, as I'm still smoking it, I think I'm going into nod territory again. 

The synergy with the weed, IMO, is amazing... But different strokes for different folks. Also depends of the strain, but this sativa helps me stay active I want to do something, but still allows me to sit down, listen to Slowdive and Joy Division, maybe Radiohead, and have a great nod (Even though I'm going to have a small line now, to maximize it). Like I was explaining to a friend, it feels like a very weird weed high, with the euphoria, warmth, nod and even rush of heroin.

This is probably the best way to enjoy the synergy between heroin and weed in a good way! I generally don't smoke weed when I'm high, just chain smoke cigarettes like crazy 

**TL;DR** - If you have #3 and struggle at chasing the dragon properly, and enjoy or want to experience the synergy between weed and heroin, putting powder in between parts of your joint might be a way to experience how awesome this ROA is, and not as wasteful as simply sprinkling precious heroin over your weed!

**NOTE** - For the skepticals, it's impossible that my first experience was only placebo effect... More like the opposite! I just wanted to do it for the flavor, and I think I read about this somewhere, so I decided to try it but **I did not expect to feel anything!** Maybe the second (current) experience can't be considered, since I binged in a-PHP last night and snorted and smoked some dope this morning (no sleep) for the comedown, but for reason it made me feel more awake, and obviously all comedown symptoms were gone... And I did some benzos last night, so all the benzos  I took, then DXM before starting with the dope, plus the Klonopin afterwards, and the hydroxyzine before smoking the joint... It might be quite a potentiated high, but still amazing.

**WARNING** - This might hit you harder than expected. I really suggest taking breaks! And only use a total amount of powder slightly bigger than the one you'd smoke on foil. Or around the one you'd snort. You know your tolerance (and this is probably not very useful for those with a high tolerance... or it?)

**RANT** -  I finished he joint whil writing tis, and I'm almost noddingggg but i need to get a pack of cigs :( I don't wanna be rollying my own all evening! (But I'm so comfy here)",1480869038.0

I've looked up strength comparisons to oxycodone & almost all answers have provided that it's 2x as strong. I have a tolerance of 60mg oxycodone, should I start with 10mg and do a quarter more every 10-15 minutes until I'm where I want to be? I've had people tell me to do .25-.5 first & go in that increment every 10-15 minutes but the only thing I'm ""worried"" about with that is missing the rush. With oxy whenever I'd start with a lower dose than my tolerance & go up every 10-15 minutes I never got that initial rush. 

Any personal experience/insight with dosing Opana would be helpful & appreciated :) thanks!",1481012668.0

The hidden second addiction.","This has been on my mind recently. I would like to share with this sub. Will have some length, but not much. Let start: the needle. Most heroin users usually find themselves using a needle eventually. But now they have a second addiction, the needle. To non users/addicts this isn't really known. The needle was a drug in itself. Every drug was better IV. If I could shoot it up, I did. If marijuana was able to be IV I would have.

It becomes your partner. You wanna do some heroin? Better shoot it. Maybe a little meth? Better IV for that intense ass rush, ditch the pipe. Crack? Yup in the rig. Everyone doing MDMA at the house party?  Better hide in the bathroom and shoot that shit, why eat/snort it when you got that nice rig in your pocket? 

I didn't want to do a drug any other way. All drugs are better shot into my arms. Especially heroin, no high better then a nice fat shot of heroin. The needle was just as hard to quick for me. Love everything about it. This isn't really talked about I feel like. Since going back to occasional heroin use, I have zero desire to shot up. I just did a .3 and chick is nodding of a point and a half, ""better IV man. Look at her, half of what you did and she is twice a high as you"" my mind says that everytime I see somebody shot up. This is very very rare that I see somebody IV. I walk away. 

Before I got back on heroin, I was on my second DOC exclusively meth. Same with that drug, seen people go from sober to spun on second. Meanwhile I'm taking my time with my pipe. Always turned down the offer for a free clean rig. Since I got back into drugs in general, will use any ROA besides IV. With strong will power, I don't over use often. 

It's when I load the rig, hit my vein and push that plunger down. That's when drugs take my life again. Fuck the needle. The needle is the worst drug I've used. Does anybody else have similar feelings towards needles?",1481008764.0

He was living in Fl working stage lighting and making DMT on the side, and lots of it. One night he was tripping on mushrooms while his girlfriend Amy was driving him to a friend's. They passed a car accident that had just happened moments before and Bill, being the hero that he is, made her pull over so he could assist the victims before the paramedics showed up. Before he even got his seatbelt off to save the others a drunk driver crashed into his car at full speed. The police would later say there weren't even skidmarks from breaking. Bill broke his neck that night and was left quadriplegic. Could you even imagine such a traumatic experience while tripping? I can't.  Bill has the use of his thumbs and can move his arms but doesn't have full use of the muscles in his arms and no finger movement. He cannot use any muscles from around the nipples down. He cannot cough,  fart, shit, all the small things we take for granted and don't think much about.  About for years later and he's doing well, not wonderful, but alright.  When he first was released from the hospital after months of rehabilitation they had him on every type of pill you could think of benzos, anti-depressants, opiates, patches, barbituates, antibiotics, and more. We used to take one or two of everything and just see how fucked up we would get. He is my best friend but also my roxi connect (they stopped giving him morphine and Fentanyl). He is very young and doesn't get a lot of disability money so I trade him marijuana for them which is the only medicine that will stop his muscle spasms. I got 4 this morning and 4 more tonight,  he told ne he will always trade with me when he has it but is concerned I'm taking too many too quickly leading to a week of WD each month.  Do you guys have any suggestions for helping with self control? I have legitimate pain from scoliosis but also do a bit more than I should.

Our normal sub plug decided they were done getting high and needs their subs now and has been refusing to sell them. This led to a couple nights of shooting overpriced blues, but that quickly became unaffordable so we spent the last 2 days free of opiates. 

Girly was working all weekend and happened to find out that one of her coworkers slings clear. It had been years since I've touched the stuff and she had never done it, but in the midst of withdrawal we grabbed a couple 20s on top of the sample bag he gave us to help raise our moods. Hadn't pushed off like that in a long time. Nice spending the weekend with Tina again.

Haven't slept in ~60 hours now.  Lucky for us, our blueboy hit us up saying he found some subs. Needless to say we were overjoyed! Just got back and shot a nice piece of sub with the last of the Tina. Also found some Flexeril and gabapentin hidden in the place were staying. Amazingly enough, the clear helped to stave off the wds for the past couple daysvand now we are well and will sleep like baby's tonight. 

Sometimes things don't go your way, sometimes they do. Had both happen this weekend. Spent the very last $15 we had on the sub, but now I can look forward to staying well for at least the next week (as long as we cut the sub up and don't waste, lol)

I've tried to explain it to people before and honestly i'm not very good at it so maybe someone can help me out.

What happens is that when i'm high as all fuck there is kind of like a pressure in my ears, and I only ever experience it if i'm high on opiates.  Imagine how your ears feel when they pop when going in an airplane or changing altitudes quickly.  Now the best way I can explain what i'm feeling is the exact opposite of how it feels when your ears pop.  

I know that is not very helpful, but it is the best I can do.  It is like pressure in my ears.. or a kind of lack thereof. Like there is just a void almost.  It literally makes my hearing worse. Like that pressure/void sound is louder than someone actually talking to me. I seem to notice it the most when i'm trying to take a piss (I have to sit down and really concentrate and try to relax when i'm high as shit and just want to fucking pee)

I've googled it and the closest thing i've found is that there is an accumulation of ear wax that is affected (effected?) by the opiate high. Idk the specifics. The thing is, ever since I was a little kid i've been taught to just clean the outside of my ears and not push the cue tip in any deeper than just the superficial part of the ear (despite how damn good that shit feels deep in your ear canal amiright??)

Anyways, maybe i'm just looking for someone to relate or maybe explain what the fuck this feeling is lol. Feel free to leave your own weird side effects too. Hope everyone is able to get high as shit (or do what you gotta) to make it through this absurdity of a weekday.",1480971229.0

If they were so concerned about the safety of society, why did they not photograph or confiscate the medication?

I'm sure they will call to formally discharge me as a patient and to go pound sand; possibly they will call the police and tell them I'm using a controlled substance not in accordance with the prescription and I will be arrested. 

I didn't come up with an excuse to not show up, I went there with exactly what they prescribed me and filled with honesty about how I use the medicine in a way that restores some quality of life and gets me through some days, and takes the edge off of others..... I had a bladder full of pee that I -know- can show I use this medicine, a head full of hair they can use to show it over months and months, but because I cut mine up instead of wear them, I am a detriment to society, I am doing something illegal, and they won't be a part of it. I suppose I understand. I have to make myself understand, because I'm tired. I'm so tired, reddit. What else can I do. Thanks everyone.

TL;DR - Got booted immediately. No chance to explain. No chance to speak. There's no chance. 
_______________________________________________________________________________
I'm sorry to do this, but something sudden and awful is happening. Short backstory; I have a chronic pain condition, and see a pain management clinic. I use a buprenorphine patch, but the pain medication never worked properly when worn on the skin.

I never abuse the medication; each week, I cut the patch into eight squares and each day, put one eighth of the patch in my mouth. I keep the extra eighth piece for a high pain day. It's something I developed over the last year of being prescribed the medication, but I never told the doctor because they are the type of clinic that I spent over a year convincing with MRIs and other proof that I was really in pain, and I really had a condition. They are very strict, made me a sign a contract, etc.

My last tox screen showed zero buprenorphine in my urine, due to low creatine. My condition makes it difficult for me to walk, so I spend most of my time bedridden. I don't have a lot of muscle mass, period; I think that's why the creatine must have been low.

I suppose because of that, I suddenly got a call today from the clinic asking I be there in less than four hours to bring the patches.

No one knows I do this, except my husband and father, and they hate the ""pain game"" as much as I do and are on board with me finding relief however I can.

So the tox screen is the only reason I can think why they would make this call.

I think it's illegal to use this controlled substance in a manner other how it is prescribed, which is wearing on the skin.
All my patch pieces are cut up, against the film, and I keep all the used pieces in a plastic baggie like some cat hoarder. 
It won't matter, I think we all know if I show up with my patches like that they won't only drop me immediately, even though I don't abuse them. They will also drop me if I don't show up. Leaving me completely fucked.

I'm sorry to bother you, I made a throwaway for this, what should I do? What CAN I do? I'm fucked, right?

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help calm me down, even if you just tell me I'm fucked. My brother is addicted to heroin so I've always been careful, but my pain sends me to the hospital when I don't have relief.",1481122443.0

My question to you IV users with huge tolerances: 

The one piece of evidence to support the idea that he was murdered is that the toxicology showed that he had a huge amount of heroin in his system before he shot himself, and couldn't have possibly manoeuvred the shot gun with such a large dose having been administered, I.e -- (**the PS Hoffman complex - not even enough time to get the needle out)** but remember that Hoffman didn't have a tolerance like cobain did.

She would probably be embarrassed to know that she was even mentioned on some stupid online forum thing. But she was my friend. The day I got to rehab, I was so scared, and I didn't want to talk to anyone, but she saw me eyeing up her cigarette from the corner and offered me one. She introduced herself and made me introduce myself. We became friends very quickly. She taught me all the rules of the facility and how to bemd but not break them. Which techs were nice and which ones were bullshit. 

She said I reminded her a lot of her sister; we share the same name and the same educational background, we like a lot of the same things, and we have similar personalities. I related so much to Kelly's experiences, and she really helped me to open up when I didn't want to talk at all. We got better together. We made sure to let each other know when we noticed a change.

She got out of rehab first and moved into a sober house. She did really well for a while. Then I got out of rehab two months after her. She relapsed. I didn't. In July I got a message that Kelly had overdosed and was in a coma. She didn't wake up for a week. But she woke up. She got better. She went back into treatment. Back to meetings. Back to sober living. She was struggling, but she was clean. 

On Sunday, her poor grandmother posted something on her Facebook that she had been missing for three days and if anyone had seen or spoken to her to please let her know. Yesterday I received the news that she was found, but she was dead. My ""best friend"" in recovery. Dead of an overdose. Her grandmother is devastated - Kelly's parents both committed suicide months apart, and she, grandma, was left to care for four children. Now she is left with three. Half of her family, dead. 

I wasn't sure where else to post this. I just wanted to put it somewhere, I guess as a reminder to please be careful out there, and not to forget that if anything ever were to happen, it's not just you who gets hurt.

Morphine & alpha-cyclodextrin?,"I am well aware of the multiple scholarly articles regarding the increased bioavailability for nasal administration of morphine when combined with chitosan. However, I recall having read on a Reddit post about mixing chitosan and morphine for not only an increased nasal BA, but increased oral and rectal BA when combined with chitosan, but no articles or explanation were provided.
I thought I would test this myself. I took about 1000 mg of chitosan orally (crushed into powder) about 60-90 seconds before taking 60 mg of instant release morphine sulfate dissolved in 30 mL of water. I had taken 0.5 mg alprazolam, 75 mg of diphenhydramine, and 25 mg of promethazine about an hour prior to ingesting the chitosan and morphine. I had an intense high about 40-60 min after taking the morphine/chitosan combination, as good or better than my best high from rectal use.
I have previously rectally administered varying amounts of morphine sulfate (90-180 mg), along with having taken 100-150 mg of diphenhydramine an hour prior to rectal administration, and have had similar effects, that took effect much more quickly than oral administration allows.
I found this article regarding a combination of alpha-cyclodextrin, xanthan gum, and morphine in a rectal suppository that increases rectal bioavailability 4-fold. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/7714736/
Anyone have any info regarding any of this? Does anyone know of any sources citing a morphine/chitosan oral solution increasing bioavailability ? Or think an alpha-cyclodextrin/morphine oral combination could increase oral bioavailability?",1481090928.0

My friend figured they had just gotten wet and maybe went through too many hands so she shot a small test then half of one. She felt something in her throat and a warm feeling so I did half of one since I have had roxi more recently than her.

What is your copping and using ritual like whether daily, weekly, monthly, etc.? This question needs some context to answer because everyone's situation is obviously different. First, what is your DOC and how do you consume it?  Second, How much do you usually cop when you score and how frequently do you score? Finally, what units does your stash come in? Example(s): Bundles/Bags, Points/Grams, Pills, Script, etc.*

I'll answer first as an example. I sniff dope. I usually get two or three bundles (20-30 bags) every 7-10 days. I'm no longer a daily user so rationing is something that I am practicing much better these days. When I cop I know I'm gonna go on a nice run and then detox for a few days and be clean for a few days before I score again.

I usually do about a quarter (20-25%) of my newly acquired stash the first day because my tolerance is somewhat reset from a quick detox and a few days clean so 5-8 bags gets me Lit AF on day 1. This is typically a short day for me because i get so faded I end up zonking out early and getting a great night sleep.

On day 2 of my run I usually do significantly more (40-50% or 10-15 bags) out of necessity now that the dope is back in my system and end up using from early in the morning, waking up excited to use, until late at night on day 2 because I'm so high I redose until i nod off at like 4 or 5 am. Day 2 is typically my big day.

On day 3, now that 60-75% of my stash is spent, I start tapering down. I have been going hard for 2 days at this point so I usually just do a few bags (10-15%). Same with day 4, usually killing my stash at this point. On day 5 I usually wake up and scrape all my bags for one last fat line before I detox, stay clean for a few days and then repeat. The longer I can stretch my stash after going hard days 1&2 the happier I am and it hurts much less once it's gone.

*I don't expect this detailed of an answer from everyone obviously but since everyone's use/habit is different I'm interested in how all y'all manage your stash (or don't lol). Really I'm asking how much of your stash do you use the day you scoop (maybe all of it and you pick up everyday?) and how do you ration before picking up again?*",1481076133.0

Next thing i know I wake up in the back of an ambulance after a narcan shot. Took a piss test at the hospital, they said I only tested positive for opiates but they could not determine what kind.

The powder itself was Snow White, with a weird coke like aftertaste . Please be very careful everyone and do not make the same mistakes I made, when you get a new batch please only do a small amount to test it first. I'm thinking it was fentanyl or some dangerous analogue like carafentanyl. dboy also did some and said he was fine albeit it was a strong batch.

On a side note: Narcan was not nearly as bad as I was expecting, the worst I felt was warmth dry mouth and headache and over stimulated . My heart beat was over 140, so high that they initially thought it was cut with coke or meth. The narcan was definitely not pleasant but It wasn't suicide inducing bad . The paramedics also told me that I had seizures but they were being dicks and lied to me about many things.

Please be safe out there everyone, what we do is dangerous enough, but whatever it is there is something nasty in this batch , also please don't be a moron and intentionally seek it out. Paramedics made it seem like it was a coop

I've consulted with the interwebz and decided that I would prefer to do a rapid detox with subs at home w/ no doctor supervision (Im willing to take the risk). I've made it thru the worst of the withdrawals and have taken 10mgs of sub today. Today is my first day. I plan on tapering down to 2mgs and jumping on day 6. Ive been told that this wont result in any significant dependency on subs so great! Good for me, but a lot of ppl have cautioned me about PAWS and how helpful subs can be with combatting this. I would prefer to not be a wretched, depressed bitch over my 2 week long vacation so I'm seriously considering taking subs for the next month, until I come home. However, I have read some seriously horrific cautionary tales about sub addiction and whatnot and I'm...worried to say the least about going down that route.  

So in you opinion guys, which withdrawal is worse? Given that I taper off subs as well and don't just jump from a high dose. 
Also, do you think it would just be better for my mental/physical health in the long run to just stick with the rapid detox and stops all drugs after day 6? Note: I'm extremely prone to depression and am not currently medicated.

The rub is that if an addict could do that, s/he wouldn't be an addict to begin with.  Your sleazy opioid brain will always inch it up on you when you're not looking, so you need help.  An action buddy to check in with is a good way to go, but you're antisocial.

What is to be done?

I had been stable at 200mg for about a year.  On occasion I inched up to 300 or fell down to 100 if I was running low between shipments.  I can sleep well on 100.  Anyway, I was starting to hit 300 more often because I'd take 200 in the early morning and then 100 as a pick me up later on.  Cut to last month when I royally screw up my supply and have to score some French trams last minute labeled ""biogaran"". These trams allowed me to function and sleep, but they caused mild nausea if I moved at all.  I found myself easily taking the bare minimum of 100 a day and after a week I dropped down to 50mg.

What I noticed is that I was not as quick minded and peppy ( I am naturally ""slow"" due to low seratonin), but I could experience emotional response from music more readily.  It was very nice.  I found that if I set aside time to listen to and play music I felt very good.  Let's be clear, it's not pleasant for someone who's been taking tram as long as I have to cut down.  It's been a major disruption. I suddenly am pretty useless around the house with dishes, laundry and sex, although my sexndrive has gone up.  But I can tell you this;  if you want to quit tram, get yourself some French stuff, and try to remember all of the songs that ever made you feel anything in your life and listen to them over and over.  If you play music, play lots of music (except acoustic guitar because the strings will dig into your left hand and hurt more than normal while you're kicking.  Actually, there are some cadences and chords I gravitated toward that I was particularly sensitive to.

I don't want my friend to know my regular Reddit name, so I have a throw-away in case she ever Googles the question she sent me.

FWIW, cancer, having body parts cut off because of cancer, chemo, and radiation all suck.  My friend had a double mastectomy and quite a few rounds of chemo.  She said the radiation wasn't as bad but still sucked.


Here is what she sent via messenger:



""I have a question I hope you can answer.  If not, maybe you know someone who can.  Let's say a person is prescribed oxy and takes percosets or morphine or any other pain meds.  Can a blood test tell the difference?  I'm thinking not because they are all opiods, but not sure.  Don't think I spelled all this right.""

I called her after getting this message to talk to her.  She gets 30 pills of some sort that are supposed to last 90 days; even her oncologist says that isn't enough but that's all he will do because of fear of problems with the DEA.  When those 30 pills don't last 90 days (she said they usually last about 40 days because she can go a day here and just deal with pain), she resorts to taking Loratabs and something called Morphone (? she said it wasn't Morphine but Morphone) that she gets from friends that have stuff left over after surgery and dentist visits and stuff.

She starts at a pain management place in a few days and is afraid that they will be able to test her and tell that she has been getting things from friends and will turn her down.  It takes months to get a spot with the pain management place here.  She is a little past one year since the final surgery and her wounds have only been fully closed for a few months.  

I told her I thought, from reading here (I like y'alls stories and how chill you are, so I read here a lot) that maybe Methadone or morphine show up different in drug tests and that I'd ask here to find out for sure.

Now I don't really want people harassing me by saying things like 'you fukin baby 4 days of use cant give you withdrawals you assfuck grow sum ballz', but keeping in mind that I had no tolerance, how fast, short acting and potent this drug is (around 50 strong doses in 1 gram.) it was enough to give me withdrawals on monday.

Here's what I want to ask: That one line was enough to give me another day of withdrawal. It was not as severe as the first day, but I felt like it made the withdrawal longer. I don't know if it still would go on even if i didn't snort that line. How serious are these small relapses?

5gu2id,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5gu2id/part_3_naltrexone_diary/,7,https://redd.it/5gu2id,Blockeduser255,Part 3 naltrexone diary,"Ran out of dope after a month long of using erryday. Have worked up to 300-450mcg of naltrexone per day split up in multiple daily oral doses over 2.5 weeks .

Results? Withdrawals are *almost* non-existent. Just the occasional hot/cold flash, and very minor cravings to the point where I hesitate to even call it a craving, more like just wanting to not be sober. The most accurate description is how you'd feel after a few days using back in your totally opiate naive days, before withdrawals became a thing.

You know how I know it's working? Less than 1.5 weeks ago I'd wake up so sick with the dreaded jangly arms and legs where I couldn't get a shot in me fast enough. Now I wake up wanting dope like I want coffee-- not essential, but nice to have. That for me, is amazing. I can go without, even if I don't want to. You don't have to have that impending doom feeling riding your back all the time. It's huge for people wanting to taper down and take a break.


No runs (haven't been constipated at all while using), no RLS, no sniffles, nothing. It's quite remarkable. Tolerance has stayed the same or slightly decreased. Not a miracle panacea but a useful addition to any regular user's arsenal.

I would say this-- for anyone most interested in just potentiation and boosting the high, lower doses are better. I think the reason I don't feel bad cravings is because I've been blocking some euphoria at this dose. It's hard to say but it feels as if euphoria is tied to the opiate receptors which are associated with tolerance, withdrawal effects, itchiness, constipation. While analgesia remains good, and bad side effects are diminished, you pay for this with less euphoria. 

*However*, depending on when I dose the NLTX and then use dope, sometimes I'm hit with overwhelming euphoria and this is repeatable multiple times throughout the day. Since I'm constantly taking different doses of NLTX as I'm tapering up, it probably has to do with how much I have in my system at any given time. 

Without being very anal about dosing amounts and times I can't give a clear answer. But my best advice is if you are chasing euphoria is to dose the NLTX half an hour before you do your dope, and stick with 1-5mcg at first, but I think around 120mcg total per day is my sweet spot before effects diminish and blocking takes place. Sometimes I get lucky for a day and I get intense highs with good rushes that are repeatable multiple times a day. There is no such thing as constipation, which is amazing considering the state my bowels were in before I started this regimen. In fact, the first time you take NLTX, you can feel your bowels loosen up as the dose goes through your stomach and your intestines. It takes up space on those gut receptors and doesn't let the drugs bind anymore.

Overall, for chronic pain patients this is a very valuble tool. For people wishing to get most out of recreational use, it works as well, but you need to find your ideal dose. There's a parabolic effect.

I got more dope and will continue doing what I'm doing, eventually getting to a point where the NLTX rebuilds my receptors. I'll probably need a couple weeks totally off dope and ramp my doses of LDN up to 4.5mg. Apparently 1mg is the highest you can go while also using dope, until you've had clean time. I want to get to 1mg then quit dope for a couple weeks. Then I plan to use as I wish and take NLTX at night and hopefully never be dopesick again. I require pain killing effects but I'm sick of being dependent and suffering withdrawal. There's a dude that used to post here that does exactly that. He has used everyday for months and takes 4.5mg at night. He's quit for days at a time and never felt a shred of withdrawal. 

Best of luck all!",1481044496.0

Needless to say I was not expecting these effects form such a small dose.
Anyway it's been 10 days now, all back to normal.

Luckily for me, gathering money to cop was not the problem this time.

Early morning before leaving for work, I had made plans to drive the 40 minute trip to grab a bunny after my 12 hour shift. The night before I had randomly found an old pack of unused rigs, still 2 inside, so I grab one of those for later.

Fast forward to after work, grabbing my shit, and squatting in the local gas station bathroom after spending my last dollar on a bottle of water to use to shoot up out of. This is when I realize that I smoked my last cig on the way there, totally forgetting that I needed the cotton from the butt. Extremely pissed, I walked the cap full of dope sketchily out to my car, trying to think about how I'm going to get this shit home without fucking spilling it or anything, or keeping it hidden god forbid I got pulled over. 

I noticed I had a dollar left, went back into the gas station, and told the guy as a joke, ""man I really need a fucking pack of smokes, (which I really did, hadn't had one all day), gimme 1$ scratch off"" - of course, I lose, and hang my head and walk out the door. I frequent this place a lot, and always talk with the guys, I think they are from some south African country judging by their accents, and always joke with them saying if I win big off of one of the scratch off's that I buy fairly regularly there i'll split it three ways. 

As I'm sitting in my car, about to pull away, the gas attendant one runs back outside and beacons me in, and says, ""wut kin' cigarette yu smok?"" I tell the guy reds, and he proceeds to buy me a pack. Boy I was sooooo grateful for this guy I could not thank him enough, def gonna hook him up next time I come through. 

Now I can finally go back into the bathroom and shoot up, right? WRONG! It turns out, the rigs I grabbed had been rather old, although new, and as I'm trying to suck up the water, I realized its clogged and the plunger just wont go all the way down, no matter how hard I push. I remembered this trick that if you hold a lighter to the end of the tip for just a few seconds, it can burn out the blockage. I burn it once, nothing. Twice, still clogged. I'm starting to get pretty fucking upset after all this luck and I still have to wait the 40 minutes and risk all this dope falling out of this cap (I know, poor me, I NEED TO GET HIGH NOW! NOT IN 40 MINUTES!!! 1st world problems knowhatimsayin?) 

Finally, on the third go around with the lighter and a slight push, I hear the pop I was looking for, and she begins to plunge, hallelujah! Needless to say I drove home high as a kite, after all that. 

Hope you guys enjoyed my junky adventure of last night.

EDIT: I read a lot of people cautioning me about the risks of driving while High. I am one of those people that will **ALWAYS** do a 1 bag test shot, not matter what my tolerance, and due to the quality of the shit I get on the daily, I will never do more than 2-bags before getting behind the wheel. When I drive, I am 100% confident that I will make it home without harming myself or others. 


EDIT #2: Holy shit what a huge influx of people flipping the fuck out about me driving home high. Lets get real here, I know i aint the only junkie Mufucker to be doing this, and i can assure you, I'm never getting on the fucking highway when my eyes are crossing. I'm one of those little pussies that will never do more than a bag for their first shot ever, and even after 7 years of use have still managed to keep like a 1-3 bag tolerance. I know my limits and i can assure all you good Samaritans that i am in no way risking any one else's lives any more than me just being on the road in general. your much more likely to be killed by an Asian rather than me, but i appreciate all the concern.

5h6fxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5h6fxe/one_of_my_old_lucrative_junkie_hustles/,23,https://redd.it/5h6fxe,clickclvck,"one of my old, lucrative junkie hustles","so I've been contemplating posting this hustle for probably a year or two and finally have the time to write it out in detail and considering I'm now 98 days clean, I don't really have a need for it anymore. there are 2 parts to this hustle and you can use the second part of the hustle by itself, but I feel the first part is worth mentioning just cuz you can probably still utilize it by adding your own twist to it. I've never seen this hustle or anything similar to it posted here before, so this here is my gift to all of you here in r/opiates.

Part 1:

This hustle utilizes recalled consumer products and cashing in on returning them for full retail price with no receipt or proof of purchase needed.

So, basically what I did is find a list of recalled items on the website of a popular large retail establishment. The item I will use as an example is the BOB Revolution strollers. Once I had identified the model # that was under recall, I'd start searching Craigslist or OfferUp for said item. Facebook Marketplace wasn't a thing yet when I was doing this but that would be another great place to check out. 

Once I had located the item, I'd send an offer for a lil lower than the asking price, just like any other purchase I'd make on Craigslist. I typically would pay anywhere from $80-100 for a stroller that retails for $595. With these particular strollers, I found several ones that were a different model # but just a slight variation in appearance compared to the recalled ones. Luckily with these strollers, the original label that stated the model # was almost identical to some Avery brand address labels that I could find at the store and it was nothing but your standard Times New Roman font in black ink. I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this... simply replicate the label in Microsoft Word and print. Peel off the original label, replace with my freshly printed one. Grab a handful of dirt and rub the new label with said dirt since the label was located towards the bottom by the wheels where a crisp, clean new label might look a little out of place on an obviously used stroller that was several years old.

Next, call customer service for the store where you will be returning the recalled item, not the manufacturer. Tell them you have a recalled item you'd like to return and they will give you a reference number of sorts. Write that down and head over to the store's customer service desk with the stroller. Tell them you're there to return a recalled item and you already spoke to customer service on the phone and they gave you a reference number. Let them do their thing on their computer, check the model number on the stroller the verify its the correct item and in exchange for the stroller you are handed a gift card with a balance of $595. In and out in typically 5 minutes, hassle free. 

Lastly, take your gift card to one of the many places that purchases gift cards and exchange it for cold, hard cash. I typically could sell this particular store's gift cards for 75 cents on the dollar, so I now have taken an $80 investment and turned it into $446.25 in a matter of a couple of hours... sometimes in under an hour if I had the labels pre-printed and picked up the item, did the label swap in the backseat of my car, called customer service for ref # and drove straight to the store to return.

Now to the best part... because yes, there's much more money to be made.

Part 2:

The second part of the hustle is a lil more devious. It involves what I dubbed the ""double-dip"". 

Now, BEFORE you were to sell the gift card from the first part of the hustle, or if you opted to skip the first part and go straight to the bread and butter of this hustle, you would need to download one of the many free apps for your phone that allow you to store a gift card electronically on your phone for convenience.

These apps allow you to enter the details of the gift card such as card # and PIN into the app and then it files it electronically along with creating a bar code within the app for each gift card that you enter so that you can simply open the app and have the cashier scan the barcode on your phone, accessing the funds of the gift card without need for physical access to the card. This is where you'd enter the details of your gift card you are about to cash out.

So, with this particular store where I sold my gift cards, when you go to sell one they will initially check the balance before cashing you out, and then it will take approximately another week before their system will check the balance again and notice a discrepancy in the balance.

With this in mind, what I personally would do back when I was selling dope is find a custie of mine or have one of my custies find a friend of theirs who has an ID, as an ID is the only thing needed to sell a gift card. I'd offer them a free half gram of dope in exchange for selling a gift card for me, which literally takes about 5-10 mins tops.

They would sell the gift card, hand me my $446.25 and I'd hand them their free half gram. Then I'd head over to the store the gift card was from and make a purchase as close to the original $595 as possible, usually easily achievable with 2 different items from the electronics department such as an iPad and headphones, case, etc.

Make the return the next day and now I have a new gift card with $595 on it. Find a new person and rinse and repeat. For every person you could find willing to sell a gift card for you, you are cashing out another $446.25 minus expenses (half g or whatever is agreed upon). That's $400 profit a day for finding one person per day that wants a free half gram for 10 mins of their time.

The great part is that the only repercussion for the person selling the gift card is that they are blacklisted from selling gift cards at that particular place. Me and several of my friends have all done this several years ago under our own names and never had anything show up on our credit or anything of that nature. In fact, in the process of figuring all this out, when trying to sell a gift card once when we were already blacklisted, the customer service rep at the desk told us that all it said on the screen was ""for security purposes, we cannot process this transaction right now"". He even turned the screen around to show me what it said because he was puzzled as to why it wouldn't go thru. So there was no mention of why in the system or to any of the employees, but we knew exactly why ;) And any junkie worth their weight in dope is going to have several places at their disposal where they can sell a gift card for cash, so no one ever cared if they burned a bridge with one of the many places available to them in exchange for a half gram of of dope while they're in the throes of withdrawal.

With all that being said, I just spent about an hour writing this up and I hope that some of you who are sick af and struggling can use this information to your advantage because this method is still very viable although I haven't done it in a long time myself, many friends of mine who I taught this to were still using it as recently as maybe 9 months ago or so. I purposely left out the names of the retail establishments and some details and specifics for obvious reasons but I assure you that if you're determined, you can very easily fill in the blanks and figure it out and that it will be very much worth your time.

I'd be willing to answer any questions you guys might have but I am a lil hesitant to name any specific stores or places, so just keep that in mind.",1481196666.0

So just a little back story, Ive been an IV user for 6-7 years, did sub maintenance years ago when my tolerance was much lower and it worked for me. Fast forward to the present, I had went to rehab twice a few months ago and they did a suboxone taper. First time it was 8mg. Took it after maybe 18hrs and was still deathly sick the entire time. Second rehab, I thought maybe 8mg just wasn't enough or that I took it too soon, so this time I waited practically 30hrs and snuck my own subs in and took 2 8mgs. Was still deathly sick the entire time. Im talkin like FULL BLOWN WD still... 

Now why is this? I have asked this before, and some people say its because suboxone has a ceiling effect. Which means basically even if you take more suboxone it does not increase the effects, therefore does not help with your WD symptoms better.

So in that case, why do they have 4mg, 8mg, and 12mg suboxone strips? Right. Because if you take one 4mg and that works for you, great. but you cant take more because it wont do more. Or if you take one 12mg suboxone and that works for you, great. but you can't take more. 

So maybe 8mg wasn't enough for me. But why the second time around I took 2 8mg (16mg altogether) at the same time, and was still sick? That can't be due to the ""ceiling effect"" because I took it at the same time. 

So now I am confused? Some people say that ""less is more"" when it comes to suboxone. How does that even make any sense? and if that were the case how come there's 4mg, 8mg, and 12mg? If you go to a suboxone doctor, they would prescribe someone who's a low user 4's. Someone who's tolerance is somewhat in the middle 8's, and someone who has a high tolerance 12's. Right? or am I wrong? 

Lets clear this up. I know many people are going to say different things, but maybe we can patch up this confusion altogether. 

All and all, I really just want to know why suboxone doesn't seem to be working for me anymore. 8mg didnt work, and taking 2 8mg's at the same time (16mg) didnt work. Was still sooo sick, full blown WD. Why is that? Is my tolerance too high? Or is it because ""less is more,"" or because of the ""ceiling effect."" ??? 

Id really like to know....",1481153409.0

Why is it, do you guys think, that you never see bags stamped in yellow, pink, or orange ink? I suppose some of ya'll may have seen these before, but I certainly never have.

I guess I can understand not using yellow as you run the risk of it not being very visible. However there are definitely shades of yellow (IE; mustard) that would show up just fine. I'm even more curious when it comes to orange though as there wouldn't be any visibility issues with it at all. And it clearly doesn't have anything to do with only using primary colors (plus black) as I've encountered multiple shades of green and purple bags throughout my run. Pink is a touch more tricky though as I've had bags in the past that could possibly be considered pink but that I would simply call ""light red"". (Which is how pink becomes such a gray area since it's basically just light red half of the time.) I've definitely never come across any hot pink or magenta bags though, which sounds fun. Ha ha.

Having said all of that, I know I'm not simply forgetting coming across any of these colors either. I'm actually a big ol' dork who keeps a log of the different stamps I've had. Ha ha. I just do weird shit like that and it adds a sort of ""collector"" type of vibe to my habit. In fact, if I get bored later on  I may even update this post with some numbers pertaining to which the most and least used colors are. (Any guesses?)

Anyway, what are everyone's thoughts on the lack of yellow, pink, and/or orange stamps? OR have any of you guys had any of these colors? Either way, thanks for entertaining me and my lunacy. Ha ha. Much love! XOXO",1481149569.0

Doc prescribed me oxy for nearly 2 1/2 months, then they suddenly cut me off without warning. I don't know how they can do that to people, but they did.

Working full time and running a near full time business on the side, I found myself with HEAVY withdrawals so i had to go to the street to get my pain meds (hookup introduced by my wife of all people). It's been close to 10 months, and at the peak I was up to 600+ mg of oxy a day. I kept telling myself that I could budget $300 per day (paying $1 per mg), but somehow I slipped into the abyss and found myself with a very expensive habit.

I have been on a short taper, down to around 300mg per day. It's definitely hell. I managed to get a week off of work to try and kick this as best that I can. I'm ready to get off of this shit, but I do not have a support system at home. Frankly, my wife is a total bitch, she hasn't worked in a steady job in 10 years and is the type that  just complains about everything and doesn't solve problems very well. 

She is demanding that I quit. Her stipulation is that when I go through withdrawals, I can't be ""mean"" to her. I'm never mean to her, but the one time that I went an entire day without oxy I had a full taste of SEVERE withdrawals. I wasn't mean to her, but I was a train wreck. I know that I cannot control emotions in that state of being, so I don't know what she thinks I am suppose to do.

Anyways, I am definitely in a time crunch with this. I can't jeopardize either my job or my business. It totally sucks. I got 250gr of Red Bali kratom from a local head shop that has trusted reviews. I am aware of the risks, but I fear that 5 days isn't going to be enough time to go cold turkey from my habit and be able to be partially functional by Monday.

This definitely sucks, but I have to do something.",1481148895.0

I've been on the 50mcg/h every 72 hours for about 3-4 years now and on 7.5 hydrocodone as needed (script is up to 4 a day).  

I have been on the same brand for the whole time, PAR pharmaceutical.  

However, my last pain appointment my doctor told me I had too many air bubbles in my patches and that I wasn't putting them on correctly.  I told him that that's how they came and opened a new one in front of him that had tons of air bubbles in it.  He suggested asking my pharmacy to buy a different brand because apparently PAR brand is the cheapest brand. 

I did just that and picked up my script today. 

The new ones are from the brand Mallinckrodt.  

My issue is that I can normally tell when I have put on a new patch within 3 hours.  It's been longer than this and it feels like I have nothing in my system at all.  

Is there a difference between the two brands?  I tried googling but I couldn't find a good source comparing these specific brands against each other.

I'm 18 years old, male, and use Oxycodone 30-60mg daily when available. Now I've first gone to the doctor with neck pain at the age 14, guy was a Harvard dick, highly arrogant even after telling him Naproxen was not working. He wrote me a fucking prescription to get a massage. A sarcastic prescription that is. My mom has given me massages all the time. They worked because of the love & hands of Gold she had. RIP. But after the massage was done, the pain was always still there.

Went to a very professional based pediatric center with very caring doctors with great techniques. Ordered an MRI with contrast and imaged my spine completely. They ruled this pain out as stress.

Now my current doctor, completely disregarded my concern for my neck pain. You know: ""I am so young why does my neck bother me so horribly all the time. I exercise, I eat healthy, etc."" in which all I do. Her answer was: ""you're young, don't worry about it!"" I'm constantly rubbing and touching my neck all the time. It's horrible. My neck won't even crack any more. It feels like the jelly between my disks are worn down. I don't know if that's possible at my age, but it's hell.

So asked a couple of the homeless ppl and eventually one said he can get some. Went with him and after maybe 45mins / hour we had scored! He got clean tools (pharmacies hand them out free here, you get needles, citric acid, filter, spoon, water and even a alcohol wipe!). Anyway so he had his hit (we split the bag 50/50), now as my tolerance isn't very high for heroin and also due to the fact I had 300mg codeine this morning he split my half into 2 needles (1ml needles btw) for me.

But Yh we went to score another bag 15 and he wanted coke so he bought 20 of that. Also wanted to score blues/yellows (Valium here) so we went to head to where the guy for them stays. As we were waiting for the guy he had also taken one of these free bikes in the city here. So we get to a park and it's a bit downhill so he goes down and I start jogging a bit to keep up(baring in mind I'm pretty high of that shot of dope) long story short he kept cycling (he had the coke and dope) and he didn't come back fml so I lost 20 worth :-(

Luckily I still had the guy who we scored of offs phone number. Called him up headed back to were we met him the first time and got a final 15 bag for myself :-/

Could of been worst though and Atleast I got my shot this morning another 15 bag and another small shot to go (will post picture!) I'm sitting in a toilet of a department store as I type this feeling pretty high lol

So Yh to shoot this lil shot or not hmm I've only ever snorted by myself, whenever I've shot an experienced user has done it for me ^^

There are two ways you can check if a syringe has been used. One isn't completely reliable, one is a sure fire way to know if a syringe has been used before. 

Method #1 - The gAP. Most syringes, when new  will be drawn back just a tad bit. Usually 2 units. Of course, someone could use a syringe and if they are scandalous draw the plunger back two units.  http://imgur.com/a/XulBb

Method #2 - The water/blood bubble. Take your syringe and push the plunger down, even after it wont go anymore. A new syringe will not produce any liquid. A syringe that has been used will push out a little droplet of blood or water or whatever was left after the last shot was done. 

These methods are obviously not fool proof, the safest thing you can do is buy your own at the pharmacy, online or at a needle exchange.

I don't even middle unless someone I know needs some badly and my plug won't serve them.

I knew these 2 young guys. Guy A and guy B. Guy A does boy and would have me go through my plug for him. He knew my plug but robbed him a while back so he couldn't go to him. Eventually guy A finds a new plug and stops throwing down with me then dies from an OD off boy and pressed bars 3 weeks ago. This week a guy that looks like turtle from entourage pulls up to a spot I'm known to chill at and says ""hey are you highsandlows? Guy B told me you could hook me up with some boy."" I asked why guy B didn't call me or give him my # to which he replies guy Bs phone broke. Ok, reasonable, guy B hasn't had a working phone 90% of the time I've known him. I ask turtle what he's trying to get and he says a couple points or a half g. I said I'd hit up my plug but I'd already decided I wanted nothing to do with this fucker. Something about the way he talked and a gut feeling. I talk to my plug and he'd just lost some customers and says hed hook me up if I sell to this turtle lookin fucker (any1 I get stuff for from him has to give me their $ and I get in his car and get it and take it to them). I told my plug I couldn't get ahold of guy B and had a funny feeling so I wouldn't do it unless I knew for sure this guys on the level. I tell turtle my dudes out. He asks when I'll be good again (another red flag as I don't sell). I said idk I'd let him know. I never texted him again but he kept texting the next 3 days asking ""you good?"". Finally I go off and tell him I'm not good, I will never be good and I don't sell and never have and I was trying to introduce him to someone who could help him but the guy won't talk to him since no 1 would vouch for him. He calls me saying guy B vouches for him and he doesn't understand why I don't trust him. I explained idk him and guy B can't be reached and said I don't even do boy anymore(I totally do). He tried begging then he tried getting pissy and bullying me so I told him to fuck right off and try his luck coppin in the bluffs downtown. 

Yesterday I randomly encounter guy B. His phone really is broken but he didn't send anyone to me. In fact guy A's parents tried to get guy B to tell me the guy was ok to deal with. As he put it ""they're on some 12 shit."" Guy B refused to do it and had been lookin for me to warn me since he couldn't call me or get my # from his phone and 90% of the ppl I know don't know my real name since im the kind of sketchy degenerate that always goes by an alias. Thank God. Then guy B sold me some bars for the low and we went our separate ways. I had nothing to do with guy A's death, in fact he'd been selling me boy, girl and bars and now fuckers are out to get me. 

Always listen to your gut and when in doubt say fuck that. I needed a shot bad when this fucker approached me. So glad i played it safe.",1481241669.0

The bulk of the scam is making up some reason for an internet stranger to deposit a check made out in their name into their personal account, then sending the majority back in the form of a money order and you get to pocket the difference. It has gone through a few iterations, initially this was the nigerian price scam where the prince would send you a check for $50,000 nigerian maori-bucks or whatever and you would deposit it, the bank automatically converts the currency(the reason the prince couldn't do it, the coup de ta means I can't use my own currency, boo hoo) and all he needs is $5,000 to escape the country, you get to kep $15,000 for cashing a check and sending a western union. So International Cashier's checks clear in a day or two automatically but they don't actually get the info for weeks, at which point they flag it as fraud and reverse the deposit, so now your out $5,000, assuming you didn't go on a spending spree with your ""profits"" then your overdrawn anywhere from $5000-$20000. And guess what the bank don't care that you got scammed, if they really want to be dicks they can press fraud charges againts YOU if you don't pay the funds back, At the least they are closing the account, you get a massive collections debt and you can nver open a normal checking account again until you pay it off. It then morphed into the out of town renter scam where the owner of an apt had to leave the country suddenly but wants to sublet his apt. He gives you the address(but you can't go inside because his last tennet still has the keys), if you want to rent it the landlord will mail YOU the last renters security deposit, here's the ""deal"", by doing this you get a month for free, you take the check for the security deposit it ur account, keep one months rents worth then take out the remaining sec.deposit and westurn union it to the ""old tenet""(PS there the same dude) then the old renter will mail you the keys. So here is the latest iteration, and let me tell you it is waaay more labor intensive. So they post seemingly legit work from home IT jobs on real job boards, then set up google hangout ""interviews"" which we're real(seemingly, I mean it took 2 hours to do the interview which had a skills test involved. I didn't catch on til the very end. He said great you're hired, it's 30.56/hour to do data entry/analysis, qa tasks from home(just until the local office branch gets up and running) then youll work in the office, but in the meantime we're gonna buy you a new laptop, pay for all these software technologies that we NEED to use and you'll have 30 hours of work a week. Let's setup your direct deposit, and your W-2 then We're gonna FedEx you a check for the laptop and software subscriptions. Tell me ASAP once the check arrives and we'll setup the DD and W-4 and I'll give you the longtime, trusted vendor we use for all our software and hardware(he'll give you a great deal, DO NOT buy the equipment anywhere else ONLY from him). This is where I knew it was a scam. So okay now the point of my post. As I said my credit is already destroyed, I cannot open a legit bank account anyway, right now I have a PayPal debit card and a local credit union checking account I only opened a year ago with $50 in it. I'm seriously contemplating playing the game til I get the check, at which point I will deposit it AND withdraw the money, I just won't be giving any to the scammer. Here's the beautiful thing though, I am still going to feign ignorance and identity theft when the checks bounces, I will make a scam alert. Apply for a fraud insurance claim(it would only ever pay the bank in the 2% chance it was ever approved) and set up a long payment plan with the credit union. Really in the end it's like getting a high interest $5,000 loan(which I could never get as my credit stands currently). What ya'll think? I'm 85% sure I'm gonna do it.",1481237619.0

Hate seeing old friends still screwing their lives up with drugs.,"**Feel free to skip the first 4 paragraphs if ya can't be bothered reading my 'backstory'**

I am 22 years old and in recovery. I spent 4 years living a lie and getting sucked deeper and deeper into addiction. First it was speed, then oxys, then heroin. You know the drill so I won’t go into detail but needless to say I was a deluded motherfucker. I thought I was functioning just because I could get outta bed in the morning – never mind the fact everything in my life was crumbling to shit.

After getting busted with a bag of heroin back in February reality came crashing down on me hard. I’d spent years desperately trying to conceal my addiction from everyone – and was mostly successful. I even refused to confide in friends who were also drug users. Yeah we may have partied to excess at times, but I kept up this bullshit façade that I had my shit together. To this day no one outside my immediate family except from my old dealer knows I was a heroin junkie

With my secret out in the open I made the choice to quit cold turkey and try and regain a semblance of a life. As a spoilt, middle class young man the thought of being kicked out of the family home suddenly didn’t seem so appealing in the cold light of withdrawal. So I stuck it out for a while. Then in June I relapsed hard, ended up sleeping rough, and almost killed myself twice (once via overdose, the other being a suicide attempt). On heroin I actually believed I’d be better off dead.

Thankfully at some stage I came to my senses and realised that I didn’t want to die. For the first time I stopped wallowing in self-pity or getting hung up on my feelings of shame. Instead I finally came to accept that it’s okay to feel sad. For years I’d sought to ‘fix’ my depression and anxiety through pills and powders. But today, almost 6 months clean, I am grateful for the ability to feel anything at all – even if I’m feeling down or upset, it beats being numbed out of my mind. 

**End of 'backstory'**

Of course, I am by no means recovered and these last few weeks have been particularly tough. The damage I have wrought upon my family seems irreparable to me at times. I know that my 16 year old brother hates my guts and I don’t know how to begin to speak to him. My mother has mental health issues of her own, and the revelation that her eldest son (her former ‘perfect’ child) was a no-good scummy heroin addict has genuinely pushed her off the deep end. She has always been highly-strung and controlling but her verbal and physical abuse is becoming hard to take. One minute she could be telling me how great I’m doing, the next day she’s hitting me and cursing at me for ruining her life. Add in the fact that I am effectively being treated like a child – with no phone and social contact more or less forbidden – It is starting to feel like I have very little autonomy over my own life.
I’m lucky to still be in university (they should’ve kicked me out years ago), so I get some respite there. It is a nice change to be doing well academically rather than being the complete and utter waster I once was. Unfortunately the social isolation is really getting to me. I have zero friends, and without the ‘chemical courage’ of drugs I find it very difficult to integrate with people. 

There are of course old friends from my drug-abusing days – but frankly most of those ‘friendships’ were based on nothing more than a shallow mutual interest in drugs. I meet one friend from my drugging days now and again. He was never a heavy user and has stopped taking substances altogether. However when he tells me about what people are up to – some of them people I care about – still squandering their potential, trapped in a cycle of drug abuse, completely in denial – I get depressed as fuck. 

Now there are certain individuals I want nothing to do with ever again, one guy in particular I would be happy to see under the ground. But there are 2 or 3 friends I value highly (one being my ex-girlfriend) that are still actively abusing drugs on a regular basis. Thankfully none of them are anywhere near as bad as I was but give it a few years and they might be, right?

There is no sign that these people are slowing down, in fact they’re living the hedonistic self-destructive lifestyle harder than ever. Having lived and partied among them not long ago, I know with certainty that there will be serious drug casualties sooner rather than later within this group.
Am I supposed to just wait and hope my friends mature and wise up? Should I just move on and accept that I can’t do anything to change their minds?

I warned a colleague, when we went to the bathroom after smoking a cigarette, but toilet paper was stocked up again and the water was cold. Then my order got mixed up and I had to wait until everyone was finished eating to get my food. 
Then my laptop stopped working two days ago. I brought it back to the place where I had it repaired some months back and it turned out the sata cable had to be fixed again. Today, the same problem occurred and again, I had to go there to have the cable switched. Of course, I could see the upsides. It could have been that I had to pay for the exchange of the cable or that the store was closed on Saturdays, which all didn't happen. But anyway, it's annoying and did cost me some hours I wanted to spend studying. So, it's only small things but they sometimes ruin my week. Of course there are big things too, like my mum being terminally ill and my dad being an ass hole or being addicted which fucks up a lot, but this post is about the small fuckeries of life.

I finally had the realization that I might be on some blacklist for drugshopping or something after a visit Urgent Care tonight.

About 2 months ago I hurt myself at work, but my claim is not allowing medical care beyond what my current doctor is doing - just collecting papers basically after initial xrays. (Long story, my attorney is working on this.) I do have private insurance as of Dec 1 so now have some progress on MRIs. 

My back has bee hurting worse than ever, I cry myself to sleep. I have some muscle relaxers that I take for previously dx fibroymylgia, but that's not helpful for the grinding when i walk, the pain when i drive, etc. I also can't take those during the day, obviously.

So tonight the dr spends a whole hour berating me about the claim and why i'm not getting medical care, demands I see a primary care physician, and then does an xray of only two pictures. No physical exam.

Earlier in the day I had a meeting with a ARNP in another clinic who I was told could take over the ""attending"" duties. 

I live in WA state, so here's where things get interesting...apparently all doctors can see everywhere you have been, and that other doctor was charted as ""urgent cara""

My ex-husband also dragged me around when he tried to search for opiates. I know there is some kind of database for those who are shopping, but....is it possible I got tagged as well?

Because tonight they refused to even offer me pain medication. They went as far as to say they'd need to address my psychiatric medication to give me Advil.

What are these shared databases? How can you confirm you're in it? And are there doctors who don't tap in to it or pull from it (medical history or ""shopping"" etc -- I really hate these systems in general, on a privacy level they scare me.)

**edit to add** *talked with a nurse about this..* there is a statewide database that providers are encouraged to tap into to check for prescriptions, and some hospitals check what you do at other clinics. But not all, and there isn't a ""database"" that checks you. Stereotyping, yes. But there can also be a specialty clinic that wouldn't ever know your history of medication or other visits.

Two days ago, it was hanging out with my partner, who is unaware of my use.  If stashed my gear in the bathroom drawer to sneak off and get right when the time came.  

We were watching t.v. and the urge struck so I politely excused myself to use the facilities.  I went to grab my kit and everything was exactly where I left it except for the gram and a half of dope.  A slight jolt of panic hit me but I brushed it off.  I searched all through the cabinet where I had left it and came up with nothing.  Now the anxiety was really setting in.

I had placed it in the back of the cabinet, near the wall.  I noticed a very small gap between the Florida of the cabinet and the wall and realised that my half-ball of dope must have fallen into no-man's land. I briefly tried fishing it out with a knife, to no avail.   

The next day, with my girl gone, I tried a few more ideas I'd come up with.  Half assed things like putting tape, sticky side out, on the knife and trying again.  No go.

Today, I ran out of my stash after my morning dose.  So after work. With w/d beginning to set in, I said fuck it.  Hammered the dry wall out where it met the floor of the cabinet so I could reach down.  Spent about half an hour making the hole a little larger each time I failed to retrieve it.  

I was starting to become really worried I wouldn't find it when I felt what I thought was just part of the drywall paper.  Pulled it out and BOOM!, my sweet, golden gram and a half.  

Just did a nice bit and I'm feeling great.  I was broke until payday this coming week and really sweating having to work sick.  That will no longer be an issue.  Thank the God I dont even believe in.  Hell, thank budah, allah, and jahovah.

For about two months I was taking amphetamine (amphetamine sulfate from darknet brand, claimed 85% purity and was likely true) daily to study. Doses were usually 25-50mg/day for the first month and a half, then the last two weeks or so it got up to 75-100mg/day on occasions. Mind you, I was also on 150mg of Wellbutrin this entire time. These doses are not unheard of in the therapeutic range, but this was the first time I ever touched the stuff, and I let my tolerance build as quickly as it wanted to. In other words, *I wasn't trying to get high, I was just trying to get a lot of shit done.*

So I had a massive cocaine OD that served as a wakeup call, and as a result quit amphetamine and opiates. A few days into sobriety I started exhibiting Parkinson's-like symptoms - tremors, myoclonic jerks, etc... All known problems associated with chronically high amphetamine dosing. I stopped taking Wellbutrin, thinking that would make it better. If anything, it made it worse.

Since then, only *super* high doses (like 3mg Opana IV no tolerance) really precipitate any sort of euphoria for me. I get far more sedation from opiates than I ever have, and honestly it's in the absence of a sense of a pleasure. Then high seems to not last as long.

Well, two days ago marked 30 calendar days since my OD and I took some amphetamine so I could stay up and study for an exam. Queue full junky mode and I shoot 50mg. Initially, I was pretty disappointed with myself, because I knew I was having issues with twitching and this would probably precipitate a full blown seizure.

Actually, that's wrong... *Initially* I was completely fucking blown away but how goddamn strong that rush was from just 50mg amphetamine. That dose, of just regular amp, was more euphoric than I have ever been able to get with opiates ever since I was using amp daily. And I experienced no myoclonic jerks or seizures of any kind. It had the exact opposite effect that I thought it would have.

Naturally I combined the two the following day. Alas, I felt the bliss of the opiate high I once knew and loved, but now am robbed of without amphetamine. I hate this. I don't want to have to use amphetamine for the rest of my life because my dopaminergic neuron membrane proteins are trashed from what I didn't think was *that* high of a dose. Finals are next week and I look forward to never touching it again for life, and trying to combat the drug-induced Parkinson's over the break. I have an appointment with a neurologist scheduled out next year... Surely I can't be the only one here who's had this problem? ",1481345578.0

Or have a profound effect on it?,"I've posted this question before - but I wanted to ask it again in hopes of maybe getting more advice - not even advice, just to vent and see if anyone maybe experienced the same thing. 


I've been a ""casual"" opiate user for several years. Casual as in - I used (almost) everyday at night, but I don't need opiates to get through the day, etc. I don't use to the point of nodding off each night, usually on weekdays just a small dose and  weekends maybe a little more. Come the new year- my goal is to stop using or at least only make it  a once in a while, ""treat"" type of thing. This is somewhat getting off topic, but  I feel as if I am not missing out on a lot of life opportunities. I am in my mid-20's and I really don't go out much anymore, or at least as much as I used to, and I know it's related to my use. Which is one of the reasons I want to stop in 2017 or at least cut back a lot - to be able to have my full life back, going out on weekend with my friend, not staying in all weekend, etc. 

Another reason I want to stop/cut back dramatically  is because of anxiety. I have always had anxiety as a kid, growing up. But over the past years, since I started using, I know my anxiety has gotten worse. And I am wondering, is that because of my opiate use? I know it has some effect on it,  as every morning I now wake up groggy/""hungover"", which doesn't allow me to have my head straight, which I know in-turn has an effect on my anxiety I am experiencing. My anxiety has gotten so bad that I can't even really meet new people anymore, can't really make new friend, can't form relationships with chicks let alone talk to them anymore, I don't know, I am just really fed up with how my body and mind is now. I am hoping that in 2017 when Stop (actually around xmas, since I will be away with family), that my anxiety and personality will come back, which is one of the main reasons I want to stop. But oh do I love opiates, so I know it's going to be hard but I am going to do it

Got bonded out but now i have court on january 12th, random piss tests and child protective services, etc.. going on.

I genuinely want to get clean and do right by my friends, family and most importantly my son. As much as i love H i love my son, wife, father, mother and freedom more but i'm way to weak willed to go cold turkey. Had Child services here today and failed my first piss test (which i warned her i would probably still piss hot since i used as early as tuesday before court, tho in actuality i used Wed. night figuring i'd have enough time to get clean before they came to test me). If i fail any (even the initial) test ordered by the judge on my case done by the PO department here locally my bond will be revoked and i'll be royally fucked, as it stands now if i fail anymore test for child services i'll have to leave my house. Thank god my father lives with us since me or my wife can't be unsupervised with my child atm and my father is clean, if he didn't live here they would of already taken my son which would of sent me off the deep end and i'd probably be OD'd/dead in a gutter.

The case worker from child services is pretty cool and understanding but the judge is a real hard ass, especially with it being H and my kid being involved, even tho i've never exposed my kid to it or left anything where he could be exposed, the cop that wrote up the report made it sound like he was sleeping in a bed made of dirty rigs or something because there was an empty sandwich baggie within his reach and some empty bindles up on a high shelf in my closet, the sandwich baggie had 0 residue in it and only ever contained skittles (my son ripped them wide open so i dumped them in a bag) and i told them as much/that they could send it to a lab, but none of that matters to them.

Long story short i'm too weak to do this on my own and inpatient rehab isn't really an option since i just started working a great job again with one of my old clients and would lose a $25/hr job and completely fuck my life up more. 

Is there anyone from NE ohio or just experienced in actually getting clean that can talk to me and maybe point me in the right direction? I have an appointment with a sub dr. tuesday but want to go to meetings, outpatient/group therapy or whatever else i can to help me get and stay clean and help my case when i go back to court and i'm just lost. Case worker told me to call 211 but i call it and even tho it's supposed to be a 24/7 help/crisis line i don't get an answer after trying to call like 20 times. I'm smart enough to google, etc.. but i wanted to hear from my bropiates about things that helped you get clean, anything that might help me stay strong or form a plan of attack, etc.. If this shit hadn't happened i wouldn't want to get clean at all, i was more then functional and even tho i didn't enjoy the struggle i wasn't ready to get clean, the main reason i'm doing it is to preserve my freedom and do right by my son, so i'm not 100% at the point where i can say i'm doing it for me (which i know everyone says you have to be to get clean) but i have two of the best reasons in the world to do it, one being my beautiful baby boy and the other being my freedom. Cost is a bit prohibitive since i'll already be shelling out between 1500 and 2k atleast for my attorney and even tho i make good money i've only recently got back to work and haven't been able to put anything back since other then paying bills i was blowing it all on dope, i have medicaid for what that's worth which thankfully my sub dr. takes.

TLDR: Have to get clean to avoid jail/losing my kid, other then those reasons wasn't ready to but ready to take it seriously, inpatient isn't an option but willing to do anything else that will help and just need some people to talk to and any friendly advice/war stories/etc.. that you guys can give me.


Thanks guys, much love, hope you all are doing better then me and are staying clean or staying high depending on your situation.

I know anything about etiz doesn't belong here, but I consider this sub my home and I would rather get your knowledge/advice on issues like this relative to other communities (excluding medical professionals). 


So basically I'm wondering:

1) for mild anxioloytics that may provide a little euphoria, overall making work more pleasant and maybe even more productive, I have been trying low doses of etizolam. Do you think this is a bad choice / are there similar RCs (or anything else) that may be worth trying? 


2) if etiz may actually be the best bet for what i'm looking for, do you have any suggestions for 'supplements' I can use along with it to combat the fatigue side effects? For example, today i chugged coffees and five hour energies but still was having a rough time. I'm not super interested in adderall but maybe something like modafinil or related RCs (possibly even vyvanse since it's less abusable and more stable than straight amphetamine).

I'm currently on suboxone maintenance which actually helps a ton with giving me energy and anti-depressant properties, but it doesn't help with this anxiety component. This is why i'm looking specifically for something like etiz that isn't an opiate.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can give, and I hope you're all having a super relaxed and cozy friday :) in case it's not obvious, i'm enjoying some etiz for the night.",1481333122.0

I would like to hear your story.,"Google ""ibogaine"". It comes from an African plant. When taken, it sends a user on a 2-3 day trip. When the user recovers from tripping balls, craving for opiates is allegedly gone. There's no physical or mental craving for more opiates. There's no withdrawal. It's a scheduled drug in the US, but there are clinics in the Caribbean and South of the border.

This American Life had a cool story about a former addict in NY who ran an underground ibogaine clinic. It's interesting. https://m.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/321/sink-or-swim?act=2#act-2

My sister got into a fight and got her shoulder messed up, she never went to the ER and never got an x-ray, shes saying it never healed right and that shes in a goo amount of pain..

Shes been going to to suboxone clinic for the past 6 months and the doctor told her it was for pain relief. well it didnt work and she stopped taking them on the 5th, and hasn't gone back to the doc. 

She scheduled an appt at my doc (i didnt tell her the name out cousin told her to try there) well her appt is on the 19th. Will the bup and naloxone be out of her system by then? I have a feeling that if she has bup in her system they wont prescribe to her, also with her past of going to the sub doc will that red flag her at a pain clinic? I just dont want her to waste the 400 bucks its taken to get in there.should she push the appt back a week to get it out of her system? any info on this is appreciateds

I'm aware that the physician will check her presciption history and her past medical physiciations and history.
What im wanting to know is if that her past sub doc and possibly sub showing on UA (even though she has a prescription) if that will keep the physiciation from presibing her opiates, she is really in pain, just went the wrong route for help at first.

CWE and Aspirin poisoning harm reduction,"Pretty straightforward question. Hoping someone with more chemistry knowledge than me can give me a very rough estimate of how much ASA this CWE method is likely to leave behind. While I've known about this method for a while I only started using it recently because of a perc drought. If anyone has any experience with this method and the damage that could be associated with frequent usage I would love to hear (love might be a strong word). Most of the times I have used this method the ROA has been plugging. Dosages typically 300 -380mg codeine. This is with pills using 375mg Aspirin. How long would daily use on this scale take to result in serious Aspirin poisoning?



This text outlining the process is from heroin helper:


Procedure:
Take the small piece of paper towel and fold it up so that it forms a plug about 1/8"" thick that will fit the circular area of the 20 cc syringe that you have chosen. Get it soaked with water and push it down to the bottom of the syringe. Insert the syringe plunger and push it all the way down and press the paper at the bottom. The paper should form a plug that fits the shape of the syringe about 1/8 inch thick. Your filtering syringe is now ready for use. You only have to do this part once.
Grind about 20 AC&C tablets (160mg codeine) into a fine powder. I use a thick walled juice glass about 2 inches tall and a steel rod about 1/2 inch in diameter and 6 inches long. I place the 20 tablets in the bottom and break them each by placing the end of the steel rod on each tablet and pressing while twisting. After all are broken up, move the steel rod around against the walls for about a minute to grind into a fine powder. It is important that a fine powder be obtained. Note: AC&C tabs come from basically 2 manufacturers. One makes a little larger tablet that is much easier to grind. I get this one as a brand name called ""Life"". The other maker usually is the ""Big V"" brand. Both work well, the slightly larger tabs just grind easier.
Pour the powder into the open syringe. It should go in evenly. Use a funnel or a paper water cup with the bottom cut off to pour it in. In a 20cc syringe, it will fill about 10cc or so. Gently tamp down the surface of the powder about a quarter inch or so to make a firm surface. I use the steel rod to do this. Pour down the sides about 5 to 8cc of room temperature water. Pour it down the sides as to not break up the surface of the powder. Gently insert the plunger into the syringe and apply gentle pressure. You want the water to take about a minute to travel evenly through the powder. It is important that it travel evenly, if not then you made a mistake in grinding, pouring, or packing the powder. As the water travels through the powder, codeine's large solubility makes it concentrate in the leading edge of the water inhibiting the dissolution of the aspirin and caffeine.
Collect about 3 to 4 cc of the solution, about 60 to 80 drops depending on the syringe tip. This small volume of solution will have virtually all of the codeine and very little of the aspirin and caffeine. When done, withdraw the plunger. Then, many times, you can blow hard on the end of the syringe and the plug of aspirin will come out making it ready for next time.
This solution can be sterilized and IM injected or just taken orally. I usually do 2 of these batches into a 20cc small bottle. For oral use, I'll fill the rest of the bottle with water so that I can judge the dose more accurately. For IM injection, I'll put one batch in the bottle and add an equal volume of water. Then loosen the lid to allow pressure to escape and put it in the microwave for 10 to 60 seconds depending on the oven. Watch through the window and stop it when it starts to boil. Allow it to cool and it is ready for injection into one of many enjoyable spots. A fine point for IM, they put an acidic powder in the tabs which makes the product solution irritating when injected. This can be neutralized with a very small amount of baking soda. Don't add too much though, if the solution goes basic in pH it will be much worse than the original. If the solution doesn't fizz when you add the baking soda, you've added too much.
This simple technique is fast and efficient. I can perform this procedure in a couple of minutes. If you try this with tabs containing Tylenol, it will form a solid plug of powder and no matter how hard you apply pressure you won't be able to get any solution out. For Tylenol products, use the FAQ cold water technique.

Edit: Interesting note about this technique. Earlier in the description it is claimed that most of the caffeine is removed by this process although why is not really explained (I assume to do with caffeine being less soluble in cold water). After trying I can say that while some caffeine definitely remains I feel very little of it. ",1481422671.0

I remember playing GTA and pretending the playable character was hooked on drugs and scoring a certain amount of money each day.

I definitely feel like I'm at the tail-end of my habit (at least for a while) now that I'm getting bored of living in Wonderland, a frozen adolescent mindset free from the real responsibilities of life. However, if some one offered me the opportunity to re-live the past 4 years, I would say yes. Every single year I would repeat it, for all its ups and downs---every hustle, every hour staring at my phone, every wonderful moment of bonding with the best friends you've had before you ever touched drugs and you all got addicted. I would repeat it 100 times if I could.

But time goes on, and if I ever want to achieve my dreams I've gotta grow-up and leave the rabbit hole.

Anyone else this way? Obviously we all love doing opiates, but to feel a perpetual sense of wonder and nostalgia for the game? I don't want to keep using, I just wish I could go back to when it felt like I could.

Sorry if you actually read this nonsense, never thought I'd feel the way about the game as I do lost friends, ex's, and my forever out-of-reach childhood.",1481421171.0

By the looks of it, there seems to be more functional addicts on this sub than flat out junkies. Curious if Im correct or not. What makes you pertain to either side of the spectrum? Full-time jobs? Your own spot? A car? Being in school? Simply having ur family to care for you still? Bills paid? 

I know most of us junkies will say ""Shit how did we even up here? Where has the time gone."" I could go on and on with life events that have led up to this point in time, but is that just an excuse? Probably. Or maybe not. Who knows... I do, however, have my own apartment with my man, nice clothes, an iPhone, simple shit that I need. No car, no school, no job, no close relatives.

What makes us so different? I guess what Im trying to clarify is if you think this topic is black and white; just one or the other. Id like to think there's more of a gray area when it comes to this topic but thats just my personal opinion. I know there are junkies out there who are homeless and have literally nothing (been there), or maybe ur a functional addict who has a car and a part-time job but ur family doesn't speak to you because of ur drug use.

Curious if any functional addicts consider themselves ""better"" than junkies? I know junkies can feel some type of respect towards functional addicts for holdin' it down while gettin' high. 

Functional addicts: Do you only get high here n there? How do you tolerate not using every day? Junkies can't do that. If you even pick up once its game over! Donzo. There's no recreational using. How do you functional addicts do it? Are you even considered an ""addict"" if you really aren't even addicted? Or are you addicted and ur just really good at keeping ur life together?

Just genuinely curious how people consider the 2... 

Im a hardcore loner junkie, can't even deny it, but I have my own apartment with my man, the bills are usually paid on time, I got PS4, an iPhone, nice clothes, laptop, food in the kitchen, cigs on deck, etc.. Not really ur ideal situation but it works for me right now, fuck it. I use every day but Im not stuck outside homeless or trickin' for money (aint nothin' wrong w that btw!) or hustlin' dummies for a quick buck up. Dont speak to my family very often due to my use, unfortunately. Im not content but Im ok... //(for anyone who was curious about me) So where do I line up? Im not a functional addict considering I dont have a job, a car, a family to speak to. I was gonna say I wouldnt consider myself a junkie, but thats a lie, cuz I definitely 100% am. Not that Im proud of it, but I think I can say I got my shit together somewhat on the economic/ social scale....

Do you consider it a black and white subject, or believe there's more of a middle gray area? 

Do you classify yourself as one or the other?

Also just to see if anyone else has run into similar issues, if so, I completely feel your frustration. So without trying to make this into a novel I'll try and explain my story a little bit.
      I grew up in a state that rhymes with pain (hope that's allowed). As you can imagine at a certain age most kids go from ""playing"" in the woods to simply getting absolutely obliterated in said woods. I was the typical straight edge kid hesitating to even smoke weed. Obviously that wound up happening followed by a perfect storm of readily available pharmaceuticals. In the glory dayz it was ritual for me and my friends to pool our lunch money in order to grab 25$ 80mg OC's and some weed for our after school shenanigans. We used to call the 80's ""big boys"". 
     My high school was just two floors of one long straight hallway which was irronically designed by the same fellow who built most of my states prisons. History, math, English etc. All had there own ""pod"" lol. So in between classes you could always look down this hallway to see one of us standing outside the bathrooms shouting ""Biiiiiigggg BOOOOY"". This was the calling sign for anyone to impatient to wait for the after school throw down. You could proceed to the bathroom throw down anywhere from 3-10$ and get a line cut off perfectly sized via hose clamp. 
    I can go into more stories at another time if people are interested but to make this bareable I'll stop there. 
    Looking back I realize that this period of my life got me to view doing drugs as ""normal"". So fast forward and the obvious shit happens. Oxy price goes up. Local plug gets busted. Couple years of white knuckling without any steady source. Then heroin strolls into town with her short skirt and red lipstick whistling to all the boys and girls.
     Now here I am 6 years later, fully addicted to IV heroin.... I currently live in a state further south where the ""dope"" is friggin everywhere. Seriously everywhere. Except come to find out, after trying to get help with my addiction, it's not dope. I can blast a half g an hour before a drug test (even lab tested) and piss completely clean. With state health insurance this means no detox is gunna take me. With no detox that means no rehab is gunna take me.
    I have one hook who's got genuine dope and he's out of town for work until next week. Cold coppings easy but none of the Spanish dudes fuck with real dope. I'm broke and desperately trying to get in somewhere. 
    Sorry for the rant but the system just sucks. Like these doctors sit there looking at my ""clean"" piss telling me sorry while I'm clearly in full blown wd's. After a week of trying to make this work the only solution I've been able to get is A. Get some pain meds from a friend or relative or B. Go to the ER and say you're suicidal. It just seems like the driving force to getting clean is willingness not dirty piss. I've gotten real honest about my addiction this past week or so and now I'm being forced to cheat the system. Idk that's at least how I'm feeling. Again I'm sorry this post probably seems super scattered and long but I had to get it out of my fucked up head. I feel for all of you, this shits so hard. All of us are stronger than we're lead to believe. Love you guys.

I didn't know what to do because there was heavy traffic and I thought there wasn't anyone in the car so I kept driving. I honestly didn't think there was anything I could do about it since I thought no one was around and I didn't want to block the street.

I got pulled over 2 miles away. And then I was asked about the car and shop I hit. I said that I'm sorry but I can't talk to police without a lawyer present. Then he asked if I did any drugs, and I said that I do drugs, but I hadn't done any since 3 days ago. He field tested me but I passed, but he said I was still under the influence. Then my car was searched and they found set of works with heroin residue, empty bags, around 2g of meth, and 7 xanax. And I forgot my license at home, so I got charged with driving no license too. So I got arrested and then charged with all that.

And that's basically everything. I don't have money to pay for a lawyer. I'm behind on rent and owe parents money so I can't ask them for help. My mom is also sick so I don't want to be telling my parents about this. My friend bailed me out and I've to pay him back too. So I don't know what I'm going to do about this. I feel like I'm gonna go to jail and if I'm gonna go to jail, I might as well get really high until I have to go and then eventually OD when I get sent to jail, or I'll leave the country and go to a spiritual place like India for example.

How do you guys speed your balls? I grab a little dope and a little coke, 20 of each. I've got plenty of money, but I've been down that twisted rabbit hole of active addiction. Can't go back. Anyway, I'm usually too excited to go very far once I grab the ingredients, so I pull into the closest gas station, frantically rip open whatever shitty packaging they come in. But this time, I actually had to buy the shit the night before and NOT do it. Restless sleep, just staring at the clock until 9 am when the probation drug test joint opens. I literally jog out of the place back to my car. Yes, I prepped and banged a speedball downtown directly in front of the courthouse. I couldn't resist.

I don't want to die, so the first one is usually just a taste, probably 0.05 of each. Blast off, and return home. After an hour or two, I do ""the big one"". Its probably not much compared to what some of you guys throw down, but it usually knocks my head and gives me a wobble.

The side effects kinda blow, but it helps. I also take opiates in low doses (mostly h for cost) to be productive, which also helps my ADHD symptoms without the side effects of Adderall, but of course with shitty withdrawal symptoms when I stop taking them.

I (very stupidly) confided in my coworker ""friend"" that I take h, and a few nights ago I was depressed and texted some regrettable things about hating myself and wanting to get more opiates to be able to function properly in life. I show up the next day to a fake ""meeting"" and my bosses, coworkers and parents hold an intervention based off of the texts I sent my coworker the night before.

Everyone was crying and telling me how I was going to end up dead, how selfish I am, you know how it goes. I sat there in shock, not even having used in weeks, and was drilled with questions about when I last used, how often I use, etc. etc.  Not once did they ask me how I felt, why I tried opiates in the first place, or about my depression and ADHD which are the actual problems that are causing me to take shitty drugs in the first place.

I'm really hurt and was not given a chance to say anything. The intervention was handled very poorly and with misinformation and complete ignorance. For example, in one text I mention considering trying subs instead, and the counselor lectured me for ""trying to cop substitutions on the street"" thinking subs meant a new stash of heroin. Jesus Christ.

TL;DR: my straight-laced coworkers and family are clueless with  drugs and held an intervention to get me to stop, but they are unresponsive to helping me with my underlying depression and ADHD which is what I am self-medicating for in the first place. Any advice on getting them to stop blaming and start helping me?

I've been contemplating either an extended break or quitting dope outright for a while now without methadone or subs.  I've gotten small doses of clonidine and gabapentin from friends in the past.  The clonidine and gabapentin have helped me in the past mainly stay clean for a day or two when it's either been dry or I'm on the road but I've never tried them for an extended period.  I just saw my primary care doctor who I admit I haven't seen in a while and tried to bring all this up but she basically said this isn't my area, handed me a pamphlet that has the other various practices they recommend with the Psychiatric section circled.  Should I give that a shot or should I have just gone to an Urgent Care type of place to begin with?  Something else?  Appreciate anyone's feedback that has some experience in this area.  I feel like I've seen similar posts asking the same question in the past, so my bad if I'm beating this to death and am being lazy by not going back and reading past posts.

I have 60 mg of some decent red vein kratom on my desk, and am blown away by how well it helps get rid of wd symptoms (I even passed out after taking 15 mgs when I was experimenting). It doesn't help with the cravings though.

I have access to the name brand sub strips. I've taken buprenorphine before nasally, and was floored by it, but have never taken it with nalaxone. I've read some interesting ideas on low-dowse subs from opiophile that essentially boiled down to ""less is more"" with the suboxone formulation.

I'm just in a rough spot and need to get rid of my physical dependence without going cold turkey, and am wondering which drug will be better for the initial break from heroin. I smoke about .5/day of bth and would like to quit. I've been able to quit oxy a few times, but doap really has its hook in me. There has never been a substance that has gotten such a grasp on me.

5hvsi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5hvsi0/junkie_jesus_saves_the_day/,4,https://redd.it/5hvsi0,echolalian,Junkie Jesus saves the day,"So, I've been quite annoyed with my dealer. A few days ago he gave me a good deal on 6 xans (which I don't care for particularly) and a bundle 'later' when he reupped from his guy. I asked how long it would take, and he said around 45 minutes. So I stupidly gave him the money, since I was a regular and starting to kinda trust him. Of course, 45 minutes turns to an hour, turns to two, and after many calls it becomes obvious he wasn't coming through with the promised bundle that night. Next day goes quite the same, except late in the evening he stopped answering my calls. It goes without saying that I never received the promised bundle. The next day I call him an embarrassing number of times and never get a response.

This is quite irritating, since he was my only source, and even if I was able to find another, I had already paid him and was now broke (hey, times are tough).

Anyway, I'm fairly sure the xans were bunk anyway, since I am far from a regular benzo user, and still went through all 6 bars in those 3 days waiting, barely feeling anything from them--and even that may have simply been placebo. 

So I have now gone through my supply of Immodium, xans depleted, and all alcohol in the house has been consumed. If you're anything like me, you know that sobriety is a state to avoid at all costs. So, unable to sleep, I decide to walk to a corner store a few blocks down from my place (in freezing rain, but lets not dwell). As I open my wallet to pay, I notice a bag nestled amongst the (rather few) bills.

I then remember: A while back I had sniffed a line rather quickly and discreetly on a subway platform (off the back of a novel; do no recommend, those platforms can become quite windy when trains are rushing by). In any case, I hadn't completely emptied out the bag, as I am normally wont to do--get every last bit into me, yknow. I have a miniscule amount left, say, 1/5 a bag, but in my desperation I shoot up this pathetically small amount of powder.
 
Amazingly, it does wonders! Rush, withdrawal abated, pleasant--tho of course mild--high. And I'm someone who regularly shoots up 3-5 bags at once. I should mention that I'm not 100% sure this was real heroin--tasted right, but was completely white, rather than the tan/brown ECP to which I'm accostomed, and was cut with some kind of insoluble white substance. It very well may have in fact been fentanyl, and I hit a hot spot. I can't really explain it any other way, unless my 3 days period abstaining really lowered my tolerance.

Anyway, happy holidays everyone. I am new to this subreddit and just wanted to share my story--it looks like for the next few hours, at least, I will be doing pretty ok. Not sure what I'm gonna do if my dealer never gets back to me; maybe he decided to cut and run, or maybe he got busted. But I'll save those worries for another time. Right now I'm just going to enjoy my brief reprieve from withdrawal. ",1481535753.0

I quit cold turkey again and began withdrawals. I've made it 48 hours deep, however I got access to some 5 mg oxcodone. I was in agony, the worst withdrawal I have ever experienced. And I caved and took 15 mg (3 pills). I do not feel high by any means and I even still have some withdrawal symptoms but they are drastically better and more tolerable.

First of all, as to where I am at in my opiatic life. My DOC specifically has always been oxymorphone, and more specifically G74 pandas. So, I have been doing opiates since 2009 pretty much everyday with periods of sobriety accumulating maybe a year. Always kept my tolerance somewhat in check and never did more than 80 mg a day. I never got into the H scene for a few reasons.. I prefer the consistency of pills plus I think they are better anyways. And yes, I have tried H and have tried it quite a few times all while living in Baltimore a few years ago. 

Anyways fast forward to 2 months ago and I was on a maintenance routine/dose of 200 mg (5 G74 a day insufflated) for almost a FULL 2 YEARS. Needed 5 to not feel bad, needed 6 or 7 to really have a great day. As you can imagine, that was INCREDIBLY expensive especially paying 80$ a piece. And also as you can imagine it all came crashing down 2 months ago. 

Literally, it all stopped. Not quite cold turkey, but I had 6 subs to my name coming off a pretty bad habit. I managed it pretty well, and actually was surprised at how well I have been able to avoid WD so far. I have very limited money right now, and have been able to purchase a couple subs here and there as needed. 

Now, as of today I have NO money, I have literally 2 mg of sub left that I really need to take now. But guess what? I START A NEW JOB TOMORROW!! I have training ALL week with no money in sight. I don't know what to do. I'm out of options I feel. I'm scared. And I don't know if anyone will have any answers, but I needed to let someone know where I'm at. I don't want to do this anymore. But, I just can't fathom working a new job and making a good impression all while in withdrawal. Thank you. All love. ",1481486343.0

I did some searches and I couldn't find anything but apologize if this has been brought up before. 

I really meant to order microns last year around this time when I finally was able to get scripted hydromorphone for maintenance through my GP as I lasted a year on buprenorphine doing very well but ended up back on dope for another year & everything was all fucked up again, not able to live with any consistency or make plans to do anything. 

My GP has seen me go through all different types of hell for years and over here in Canada they have recently been doing trials with medical heroin for some lucky few & for some doing blind tests with hydromorphone with great results so I was desperate & was able to work out a similar scenario. 

Long story short, year has passed and I have not been able to switch to hydromorphone HP (IV) as all I have been confident enough to tell my GP is that I would require much less hydro (the bioavailability for oral being very low) . I am worried that he seriously believes I take them properly and would just cancel my scripts. 

I need to do something because I know the day will come when my situation changes. All I want on my records is something that causes no flags to less liberal thinking people in the healthcare field that I encounter in the future. 

Anyway this did not mean to be this long and all I am really wondering is if anyone has ordered micron filters from Amazon, I have been looking at a 50 pack of Whatman PVDF 0.2 or 0.4 that come to ~$200 CAD and it seems like my only option as GPZ does not ship here.

When they started around 2001 I was prescribed Darvocet. I was given it ""prn"" and was good about taking it when I really needed it.  I had never really taken pain meds before so 1 or 2 would knock me out. 

Fast forward to 2010, the a-holes at the FDA decided to ban it..  Thus began my meds addiction. 

The doc I was seeing starting trying different things for my headaches. Tylenol 3..4.. Ultram..  Eventually worked my way to Nucynta...  The problem was that I tried it once (without headache) to ""see how it felt"". It was awesome. So I kept taking it. Eventually getting addicted. And I was hooked on it for a few years. 

I eventually switched docs and was eventually switched to tramadol... I then started those daily, which caused a few seizures. One of them caused a shoulder dislocation and fracture. 

So now I'm recovering from surgery and also trying to get off meds totally. After surgery I was given Perc 7.5's, which I tried to not take much of, since I hear/read all sorts of stories on addiction to those and oxy; and how often that leads to H.. No thanks. 

Anyway that's where I am now. This forum has definitely steered me the right way, toward getting off any pain meds before it gets worse.

However he insisted that its because virtually everyone that tries to ""cheat"" or get on the shot is already addicted to opiates. Ive always heard that too, that you gotta be vulnerable to withdrawal in order to go into withdrawal, and i only shot up once at 5:00 today This means 24 hours will have passed by the time i get the shot.

_____________________  
  
  

There have been a slightly higher than normal number of 'I'm waiting... still' type posts this past couple of days on this sub. If you are a user and have nver, in your life, experienced 'waiting on the man', then you're either doing something painfully wrong, or haven't been scoring for longer than a week!    

As I said, I've noticed it a fair few times this week. I tgot me thinking that this type of post should have its own sub!i Damnit man.. we've ALL been there. So, I totally feel those people that are stuck wherever they are, just sitting and waiting. I joked that thanks to 'dBois' the internet is beginning to significantly slow down as texts, emails and reddit posts begin to clutter up large numbers of large internet pipes as much of modern internet traffic is dBoy complaint spam, people ranting about having to wait for their goddamn shit! The #1 amount of internet traffic is porn.. and the new second amount are complaints about waiting on fuckin' dealers taking their sweet ass time!!  (Obviously not, but absurdist humour really does helps get through the day at times)

  

I can't understand their inability to be honest about delivery time. I've even told them this - hey look I'm not going anywhere else, so whether its 5 minutes or 5 hours I'd prefer just to know so that I can plan my panic attacks around who is arriving and who isn''t .that so muc though. we're obviously just sad and desperate junkies, and so most of the time its not like we're going anywhere and most of the time, unable to score off anyone else. I have to wonder whether they get off on it.. if that level of petty control over someone give sthem a thriss to be lying and knowing that in 12 hours when that person is dying from fucking crazy-town shakes, sweating, vomit inducing sickness!

These guys all love money and I guess the perceived, perception of power (You know.. all that power over making junkies hand over every penny they have - and every penny they don't have.. ie that isn't theirs!)  

But they don't love us.. Yep, they love money, but they sure as shit don't love us. I'm sure I would absolutely hate to know what they think of the customers. We're just lambs to the slaughter. Disposable milking cows :( that pump cash for hormone laden milk that certainly ain't organic (some say its even watered down)
Even our lives are cheap, disposable and the queue for one more idiot addict to take the place of over milked cows that die is unending.  
  
  

    

Yeah... anyway.. Waiting... FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.
It's Monday today. Last week I calculated spending nearly 20 hours, outdoors, in a British December Winter, all in only in 5 days.  

   
I know you can get your phone to remember abbreviations and type them out in full. Does it work the other way, can I get messages that say 'Leaving now - 10 minutes' to translate closer to what it really means  'Leaving in a couple of hours - see you after dark. Or if its dark here, when the sun comes up'  
  

    


I managed on Wednesday last week to get a 'Leaving now. Coming direct. Be ready' at 3pm, and then I actually had to walk 20 minutes to another bus stop and met him at 3am! He had the stuff too, it wasn't like he was bagging it, weighing it etc, I could have walked to his town near mine within 30 minutes. These guys and phone manner too.. They never call back, even when they say they will. They're quite happy to talk to you and tell you whats going on if you call back, even though they said they'd call you. I avoid annoying people as I'm sure they get a hundred calls an hour - but I've had dealers hang up in frustration and leave me to stew for a day all because I was blowing up their phone trying to get an answer to something that I was told I'd be called back about. So, I do my best to be patient - but at the same time, I've had dealers drive right past my house and then blame me for not calling them back to check on their progress.. as they sail right past me, not to return until the next day doing their rounds. (Delivery dealers, quite rare in these here parts)   

  
So, instead of bothering them and making them angry OR missing them, I always give ONE full HOUR between calls, unless it sounds like they're in the middle of something that doesn't take long (like banging their mother), in which case I'll reduce it to every 15. Which I think is a totally fair amount of time to not receive promised new information in a critical life or death situation. 



   
No matter how careful you are, it is stil impossible not to make them angry. The last customer/dealer argument phonecall I found myself in the middle of was just last week..All because the first call claimed he was just walking out his front door. After an hour, of what should have been a 25-32 minute journey to me - on average, (I've made several notes on the time it takes to make it door to door - including average slow bus times. That way, I know roughly when I should come out my front door to meet delivery guys.. That way I'm not drawing attention to myself, or I'm sick and waiting in either the rain or the blazing hot sun! Or aids them having to find a parking space on a crowded busy road..) So, after an hour, I calleed to recieve an angry sounding and jaw dropping, earth shattering 'you woke me up.. don't worry, I'm just walking out the door'. Incidentally, that cycle continued for another 6 - 10 calls.   

   
  
  
I really should have learned by now - and I kinda have, but the dream of having drugs delivered to your door makes me feel so classy that I can't resist. Man, not having to go anywhere, just open the door and I'm ready to get hiiiiiigh muthafucker. Waiting 12 hours for the privillge really puts a bit of a dampener on the whole experience though. Also , rather sadly is that when you finally run that beetle at 4am, you're spending your money to be high while asleep, seems like rather a terrible waste of product.

   

  
Does anyone else know all the feelings of 'the game' intricately well. They're all very different and you so rarely get to feel the intensity of these emotions any other time in your life - and they, no matter how awful, are all incredibly addictive because of their intensity - and their final cessation when you get that final fix? Does anyone know what I mean? Of the game itself, despite its perils and its pitfalls, its pain and torture of going without and the feeling of nearing the finish of a daily race. The whole thing is alluring and you almost wouldn't have it any other way? When you're clean, part of you misses the mayhem because after all - it does give you purpose and fill your day, without i, in your sober days, what do you fill your new time with - and boy do you have a lot of it!

It all starts when you make the first organisational call, and from then onward, your adrenaline is up. Whether you're heading to him, or hes coming to you. While waiting, you have to start pacing because of the excess nervous energy. You just know in (what never is, but you hope will be - a short while) When you meet, he'll press that bundle into your hands and you can skip home like Charlie finding a golden ticket, into the nearest safe space, like a bathroom, upon arriving, you tear open the shiny wrapper or the folded paper or the plastic wrap - and look at the delicious brown texture inside. It isn't chocolate, but the child inside gives you the same reaction.

Of course, the nervous joy of that frst call doesn't last, because he never is.. 'just round the corner' (Of the rare occasion when a phonecall & pickup does take less than 10 minutes, those events seem to go straight into your longterm nostalgic memory depository to be looked back upon with rose tinted glasses, like every moment of your time using was as well organised and simple as a phonecall and short walk. It's as rare an occasion as any other in life itself, the time when everything was as near to perfect as a day can get.. and my good god damn does it feel wonderful.   

  
Beyond the first call, is the constant rush of higher and higher levels of anticipation. Largr and larger dumps of adrenaline into the bloodstream at every level of prgress. Text announcements  claming that he is 'on his way', 'near to you', 'just round the corner', 'pulling in now'. You swear you are becoming psychic as you begin to 'feel' his presence arriving!   

   


   
And after those hours and hours, when he actually does arrive. .Very few of us EVER confront our source. We expect no apology, no explanation, and certainly no free compensation.. In fact, in  true British stereotype - I often apologise for inconvenience I've caused in phoning repeatedly. I say I'm grateful. I say 'thank you' for his efforts in getting to me.    

 

One such person I frequent is a user too. I dread calling him as the phonecalls are becoming increasingly unintelligible. His mumblecore talk is getting worse by the day.. A drug user, he also drinks and has begun selling and therefore smoking crack as well. He is selling merely to support his habit - by which I would expect him to be a cut above the dealer that knows he can sit and wait. This guy should put in a bit of work in order to have support his intake. What else is he doing but that!? But I know that he wakes up at 1pm, if he has eve gone to sleep, has a beer or three, a snowball, he gets right by smoking and injecting for an hour or so. I can usually contact hm and get a promise of his travel into my town by bus shortly.. And that's where the 12 hou wait begins for me if I use this guy. Wakin up, drinking, smoking, crack and smack injections all day.. Here's the mental illness aspect of it for me. I just know that his life sounds simply awful - an entirely non existent life with nothing but drugs all day from morning to next morning.. but, damn! There is a small masochistic piece of me that believes to spend a week or two, guilt free like that would be some kind of great vacation.. (Even though, if it was sustainable, no doubt, I'd end up in that cycle until I died).

Second thing... I'm making a 2units/mg solution of dilaudid today. Got 30ml of bacteriostatic water about to arrive and got my steril vial and sterile PES .2 micro wheel filter ready to go. I've only got 80mg (which is 5 16mg shots) for me. That's probably only going to last me 3-4 days (i try to keep it to a shot a day). Anyone have an idea if this is fairly safe? The benzyl alcohol in the bacteriostatic water will prevent any growth of bacteria, and since im using a steril vial and wheel filter I think the process should be pretty bacteria free since its going out of the wheel filter and straight into the vial.

Anyone else who does this kind of stuff got any advice or comments? Will this work just fine?

IE, pull the OPI label off and put it on the THC strip and put the THC label on the OPI strip.  This way you when the test is given, you trip what appears to be the THC and OPI stays negative.

Alternatively, if you buy a 5 or 10 pack of them you can just sacrifice a whole test and replace all the OPI strips in the pack with the other ones from the sacrifice test so you pass everything.

As biochemistry has taught us: repeated exposure to agonists will decrease sensitivity, whereas repeated exposure to antagonists will increase sensitivity.

Given the long-acting activity of Naltrexone, no moderate to heavy user would even consider doing this. But seeing that Joe is a biweekly chipper, he would like to test this theory out.

The next step for Joe is to obtain Naltrexone. He finds that rather difficult seeing that he would not like his primary care provider to be privy to his substance abuse.

If anyone may be able to help Joe conduct his little experiment, Joe would be grateful.

I got addicted to Tramadol a third time about 8 months ago and am kicking it right now.

Although i ""kicked"" the Trams like 2 weeks ago, i tapered down with ER and used Kratom for the last 3 days (had a dependency as well) too ease the w/d.

Yesterday i used .5mg Xanax to get to sleep and 1mg Clonazepam over the day to stay cool. (no addiction or dependence to benzo's, got a bunch around but using them responsible for years, I'm not worrying about those too much).

At this moment I'm clean for 24 hours from any opiate-related substance.
The only last physical symptomes I'm suffering of are some RLS and insomia.
Of course low-dose benzo's help for both, but I wouldn't like to take them 3 days in a row, cause usually i take them like 1 time a week or less, I'm well aware of the consequences.

I can stand all that, but I have Kratom lying here and I know it would clear up AAALLLL those problems in a blink.
It's just that unbearable URGE to take some and fall to sleep in peace. (No Trams left at all).

Thanks to all who read this and another thanks to anyone who replies to give me a hint or just some words.

Don't really post much. But for the last 2 months I've been doing a gram to a gram and a half a day of some fire tar. Well 2 months ago my dad died from a heart attack, and is what started me using like this I've always been an addict just not going as hard as I have been. I mean I've been nodding all the time and haven't given the slightest fuck about anyone or anything. It's 6:51 am here and I'm getting ready to go to an inpatient treatment program. All I want to do is blast off right now. But I can't and it sucks I hope they have something to ween me down. I really do want to clean I'm just scared you know? Like even though dope is destroying me it's so comforting to just nod out of this world. Anyways guys wish me luck. And stay safe out there .

Edit: So just got done at the rehab. Was told that I wouldn't be seen today due to being a walk in and next appointment isn't till after Christmas. Also the appointment is for an assessment only it could still be up to six weeks after assessment till a bed becomes available. What bullshit. And since I stopped working when my dad passed I have no insurance at the moment. So I'm pretty much fucked. I signed up for the methadone clinic which I won't get assessed until tomorrow. And dosed until Friday. They would rather just lock you up I guess. Fuckin country sucks. (USA) greatest country right. Let me schedule my addiction better next time. I know it's my fault for using but all these places claim they want to help and when you get there they act like they can't do shit for you.

Update: Sorry for sounding like whiny asshole up there. That's not me at all. So I copped about 20 peach 7.5 hydrocodones I took ten today and the other ten are for tomorrow. Hopefully that will hold me over till I can get dosed at the clinic friday. Hope y'all are doing good. Much love! -Dirty",1481720145.0

 How's Mrs. Junkie Claus? How is the North side North Pole? Issit cold up there? I imagine it must be cause it's really cold here this year. I just can't stop sweating... But im sure that you know that already since you can see all the Junkies in the world huh? Wow it's amazing to even think about it. 

Anyways, I wanted to send you my list. I sent it in the mail but I got a strange message that my letter was held and I had to pick it up at the post office. Weird huh? But I've been a really good junkie this year. I did not steal from any small businesses and I made sure that no individual person was hurt or injured through my decisions and I never set out with the intention of hurting any of the people who care about me. While I depended on the kindness of strangers, I returned that energy two fold and made sure that the junkies behind me were not looked down upon because of my actions. I repayed any fronts given to me and I ensured that I did not borrow more than I can afford to pay back.  I taught proper harm reduction both in real life as well as on the Internet.... I sure do hope that's enough to get me on the Nice list. It sure is depressing on the naughty one, as fun as it sounded in the beginning. 

My list:
1) I  want to stay well through the holiday. It would be amazing to end up with enough to cop a really nice nod on Xmas eve-Xmas. 
2) a new set of rigs. (28 gauge, 100 cc) 
3)a new tourniquet 
4)a few working veins, you know the ones. 
5)a bank error in my favor 
6) This is the most important one... I want my children and family to have an amazing Xmas together and be able to experience Xmas magic through the eyes of my children without the fear of sickness and hustle. I know that know that this one may be the hardest one but I have been such a good junkie this year. And no matter what other junkies say about you... I know that you exist and I will always believe in you and your Xmas junkie magic. I just hope it is enough this year. 

I'm making nice fat shot to leave for you..in my veins . And some milk and cookies. Good luck delivering all the junkie toys to all the junkie girls and boys!

Which is whatever for me, at the time I was employed, drove a newish white sedan with clear windows, no cop ever looks twice. So anyways, after we did our exchange, 10 shady 80's (the ones that have a green coating and are white throughout, yum) for $300, gave a polite nod and headed our separate ways. Before I even pulled off the service road, I had the coating cleaned off and was almost done pulverizing my pill into a fine white powder inside my pill crusher. Before I hit the ring road that encircles my fair city for the long ride home, I sucked back that whole first pill, it was shaping up to be a nice ride. Fast forward 30 minutes, 2 exits to go and I'm home, another successful trip, may as well smash up half a pill to celebrate, so I have a really sick nod coming on as I pull into my parking lot. Tap tap tap....'WTF?' Somehow I had managed to pull safely to the shoulder and was just idling there with my car in gear and foot on the break. A paramedic was standing at my window gesturing for me to roll down the window, shit. So long story short, medics convince me to get checked out in the ambulance, I oblige, stash my pills in the center console, cops role up, accuse me of being stoned, search me and my car without a warrant, find stash, tow car, give me a PTA and a 24 hr. suspension and a ride home. Fast forward 14 months to my trial date, kind of worried because fentanyl is the devil and they've been pretty heavy sentence wise lately and the crown prosecutor is looking to lambaste me, with my student at law defending me, that looked pretty likely. Thank you Junkie Jesus for giving that dirty rotten arresting officer, with the city police, a job with the RCMP far, far away. The prosecutor was such a cunt, applied to the judge for an adjournment, confident that a second round of subpoenas would do the trick in getting her police witness to attend this matter, the judge wasn't having any of it and dismissed all charges. Second drug related charge in my 33 years (excluding the psilocybin incident at the US border, but that's a different story, for a different sub), second time being dismissed, with lots of close calls in between. Anyways, it was stupid of me to break into my stash early, I had actually drove a little over a km past my exit when I stopped, I was lucky I didn't hurt anyone or total my car or really suffer any consequences.

If I go 24 hours without it, I'm sneezing, vomiting, cannot eat, shivering, cannot sleep, etc. 
I'm gonna take a drug test on the 22nd and I'm kind of panicking. I desperately want to finish my program (Pre-Trail Diversion) but I'm having anxiety that I will fuck it up.

While I did get off light with what i have to do, 80 hours of community service, weekly or biweekly tests, drug classes called ""DOEP"", and I think one other thing. Plus a shitload of money (not an issue at this point but still sucks).

And it SHOULD be 1 year long minimum. although I had two charges, they only showed one on the court date. So I'm praying to Jeebus that the 2nd one doesn't come back to haunt me.

I'm prescribed Suboxone, but I rarely take it because it honestly doesn't do shit for me. It just doesn't seem to help. Methadone is much better, so I Think I will try to switch to that.

Albeit somewhat attenuated, due to the bupe hogging my receptors etc. Which has led me recently down the one way road of IV use - I need more to get high, so I need 100% bioavailability. 

I usually pick up on friday and spend my weekends faded, returning to work and suboxone on monday to operate like a normal human being. This week, after taking my monday morning sub dose, I started to feel the effects of withdrawal more than i usually would. Probably cus this weekend’s dope was nice and strong. Its a slow day at work so i score on my lunch break and take a walk down to the local park in the late afternoon. I never get high (let alone shoot up) on work time so I am rushing to get my shot together. It’s street gear and I’ve got bupe in my system so i put in maybe 75% more than usual to make sure i can actually feel it.

Im in a vein much quicker than usual so i get excited and push the plunger down all the way with no stops. As soon as I taste the smack in my throat these thoughts run through my head in quick succession:

* this gear is stronger than i thought

* i am definitely feeling this

* fuck. what if i drop right now

* alone in a park, near work

* who’s gonna find me, how am i gonna explain myself

My extremities start trembling and I’m on my feet trying to keep myself awake. Fucking ruined most of my shot worrying about whether I was about to fuck up. I get myself a coke from the local 7-11 and I’m back at work, all warm and fuzzy :)

Codeine: never had much experience with this one. I remember taking 15mg and feeling a nice relaxed body high where I just wanted to lay down next to my mom and enjoy the mild sedation feeling on my virgin opiate receptors. Wasn't bad to be honest. It was Tylenol 3, not lean mixed with promethazine.. heard that shit is garbage.

Tramadol: just speedy as fuck. Never felt any sedation or anything. 75mg Tablet. They were my dog's. Took it once or twice when I didn't have a near daily habit. Didn't find much recreation from it. Definitely gives you a feeling though.

Hydrocodone & Oxycodone: these are nearly similar in the sense that they give me such a clear headspace, the ability to take on the world and function in life much better. I compare these nearly as similar, only different is dosing for me. Need a little bit more of the Hydrocodone to be equivalent to Oxycodone. It's not ""speedy"" like a stimulant but it's stimulating in the sense of feeling like a human being if that makes sense. Definitely not an artificial feeling; very natural feeling. They make me very emotionally open & sometimes can cause a sedated nod of euphoria. Definitely the best opioids I've tried so far.

Methadone: fuck me pretty much the first opioid I tried for legitimate pain when I was 14. Horrible toothache had me crying. It was late at night. Dad supervised me while taking this medication. No tolerance. I took 5mg, didn't know it takes about 2 hours to start working. I take another 5mg. Long story short, it all kicked in, I was nodding hard sitting with my legs crossed, craving sugar. Did not take the pain away to be honest. It just blunted my care towards it.

Fentanyl: given to me twice for MRI sedation (claustrophobia). Made me a child again. The best opiate I have ever been given. However these two times I was given it, it was also mixed with Midazolam. So it was dosage increments IV'd at 2.5mg of Midazolam with 50mcg of fentanyl. Intense shit. Had no tolerance either.

Had no tolerance to all these drugs when explaining my stories with them. So you's can get the idea of my first experiences with these. Tolerance was no factor. Now I have a tolerance to opiates and my opiate of choice is Oxycodone at dosages of 20-30mg. When I mix with benzos I take less of each.

Share your initial experiences or any experience in general and how they made you feel, your opinions, etc.. with these drugs.

PS: I really want to try Hydromorphone, Oxymorphone, & Morphine. Can never come across these where I'm at. And not too keen on using DNM, never did, not comfortable with my current knowledge yet. Maybe one day, so better safe than sorry!",1481663415.0

Well i noticed something yesterday while administering several boofs throughout the day yesterday.  In the morning and early afternoon i administered 2 practically identical plug solutions under similar conditions. Both times i mixed 3 bags with approx. 2.5ml of filtered cool water in each. Both times i administered were also after nice movements so i dont think anything was taking away from my plugs. Both doses were a clear light brownish color and both had about the same strength high...nothing spectacular but not bad either. 
Now here comes the interesting part of my post. Late last night (around 1am) i did my last 2 bag plug. Same stamp as earlier, and all the same conditions except for 2 things 1.) I only used like 1.25ml of H20 instead of the approx 2.5ml.

2.) When i plugged i pushed the plunger more slowly than earlier and laid down watching t.v right after i plugged instead of just squirting and continuing about my business (no liquid leaked out though)...this dose put me ON MY ASS...so my question is will a stronger concentrated solution hit harder than a plug dose that is more diluted with water?",1481803288.0

Even still,  I made a throw away because I am just ashamed and afraid and I know I'll be judged and I don't want this to bite me in the ass harder than it already will. I don't have the guts to tell someone I know IRL although I really need the support and don't know how to deal with this. So I came to my bropes for some support before I just go sit on some train tracks at night. And although I know the blame is even,  if not more so in the other direction, I blame myself for knowing better (up to a certain point) and still doing it anyway.  Isn't that just the junkie anthem. If anyone is more experienced than I am and Im wrong feel free to point it out.


My fellow friends and fiends, I have quite possibly thrown my life away and signed my death certificate.

----  


So I have been homeless and prostituting myself for drugs for almost 4 years, and even before I was homeless I had sugar daddies and the like.


I was out working about a week ago, walking the track, when a dude I knew pretty well,  more than an acquaintance but not a good friend,  walked up to me. He wanted a date and offered something agreeable as far as rates and we took off to get a room.

I should mention,  the first time I met this dude he took off in his car and chased off a trick that had robbed me, almost getting his ass too. This played into me trusting him way more than I should have. Im such a fucking fool...

Well, anyway, we get to the room and get comfy,  sit down,  smoke/ shoot some speed,  then get down to it. I am going to be honest,  I use condoms with like 99% of anyone I've ever fucked with. I was adamant he use one, but I apparently have the internal fortitude of fucking Gumby. I made him wear one at first.   He balked at the condom and offered more cash for bbj,  and after enough badgering I had him take a quick shower then went back to it, then went on to the next part. I was by then getting kinda hot, as dude wasn't bad looking and the speed was fire. I put another rubber on it and he keeps going soft. Im having a good time,  doing great dope known for making people horny, and that shit is frustrating. So he asks if we can take it off so he can get hard then put another on. I say ok, we do that, Dick goes limp again,  so we try another and another time. No dice. Im wore out and neither of us have come. Halftime. I lit a smoke then called up my boy who lives in a tent around the corner from the motel. He says he'll be on his way soon with some black. So I jump in the shower while we wait, and my dboy comes while Im in the shower. They're outside talking it up when I get out, and apparently they know each other. So as we were smoking it up,hand dboy was weighing the sack, my dboy goes, to the trick, ""So you going to ah, tell her the dealio?"" ""What?"", he asks.  ""You know what Im talking about "". ""Oh. Yeah,  yea I will."" then they have an awkward silent stand off and eventually the subject seems dropped.  I was curious but not too concerned. Then my dboy starts trying to sign shit at me in ASL since I just got out of jail, but I never learned to sign, so I just stare and shake my head. Dboy goes out for a smoke and dboy pulls me over to him. He whispers,  ""Hey, I've known Trick a long time. Im not here to judge but obviously he won't tell you himself.  Be careful, Trick is HIV positive.""

My fucking heart stopped beating. My mouth dried up, I began sweating in the air conditioned chill.  I forced a tinny chuckle and said, ""Thank God for condoms, huh? "" while envisioning buying his whole stash and ending my life in blissful sleep. I then noped the fuck out, saying I had to leave because I had another date and needed the cash flow.

The only good things I can say is that I didn't share any works with him at all, not water not a cotton not shit, and he never came because his Dick couldn't keep hard. However I have a uterine implant that sometimes I guess tears a little and causes me to bleed lightly after rough sex, as it did this time. Still, all I can think is that I will test positive and the countdown till my last days will begin, and I will be a social pariah even more than I already am, that in the end Ill suffer great physical pain, and in the meantime spend my short life alone and lonely, and how the love of my life will be forced to move on, (we are broken up but still love each other more than anything)  and then wondering how I will break the news to a family I just spent my first thanksgiving sober with in over 7 years. One daughter fighting off a life sentence for a murder she didn't commit, another a pathetic junkie whore who caught AIDs and died without accomplishing shit except eternally disappointing everyone she ever cared about.


Im fucking terrified and seething mad at that punk bitch trick.... What kind of a sick fuck wouldn't tell someone they had fucking HIV? Dude tried offering his rig to me too, to which I said fuck no. I may not have very high standards but still. Im sure in his mind Im just a worthless street kid junkie hooker and it doesn't even phase him to know he very well could have just pulled the trigger and ended my life. I've just been super depressed anD getting deeper into my heroin use. I am about to sign myself in to a 51/50 psych hold so I can kick the dope without having to go through a program too, and then get a Vivitrol shot and stay with my mom while I wait for my sisters trial, but its getting hard to get moving in that direction. I've been back on heroin for about 3 weeks now and realize the more I wait the worse it will be, but all I feel like doing is descending into oblivion, alone again,  and numbing it all away.  


So there it is, Reddit.  I can't believe I let this happen, after all the caution I've practiced.  A month ago I had gotten out of jail after 6 months and was clean and happy and beautiful and had goals and dreams. Now Im sitting in the dark strung out on heroin and meth in a cockroach infested RV only moving to go piss or laying down to a few hours worth of nightmares from the future.


Please don't judge me too harshly,  because believe me I've already condemned myself. Thanks for reading, Reddit.",1481791007.0

I've wished this could happen for some time now and realized it will probably never happen (not the way I was thinking anyway). We would either have to be VERY megarich (not happening), have a wicked GDP which is probably the only way we could ever sustain our addictions (for free of course. Your daily allowance of your DOC is a basic right, more on that later.) we probably wouldn't be able to buy a country that has something to offer. We'd have to just buy some shithole country with hardly anyone in it and pay everyone like $5000 to leave and start a new life somewhere else, unless they wanna stay and enjoy the awesomeness that I would inevitably bestow upon the soon to be best country in the world. The other option is to survive by receiving funding from other nations/multinationals like the UN. Aid packages are quite unlikely (unless we find a country willing to fund this little experiment) since the countries that give those aid packages all seem to have a big budget just for fighting the sale and use of illegal substances that everyone reading this enjoys consuming.

Anyway, one of the countries' (I wouldn't actually call it a country, more like a communal state of being, or something witty like that) first basic rights will be that as long as you participate in some way, with whatever skills you have to offer, you will receive your daily dose of whatever DOC you have. You will get enough of your DOC to keep you happy but it would be carefully monitored so you would function as a normal human being while on your drugs as long as you have someone monitoring you and your daily performance. Dosages would be carefully adjusted, and you could opt to get 1-2 days of a higher dosage if you agree to only get like half of your normal daily dosage for the next 2-4 days after your party days. And of course you will be able to do whatever other drugs you like to do when you want as long as it isn't something that will conflict with your normal duties to the real land of the free. Say you want to eat some acid, well that might not work well if you have to be somewhere doing manual labor or interacting with people that you wouldn't really be able to do when tripping balls. Of course you would be the one that ultimately makes the decision whether you can function IRL on the drugs you choose to do. When you go to the main dispensary for whatever substance you want, they will go over it's effects and in what kind of setting you should do it in (I'd hope we'd have moved beyond the whole idea of suing people when it's really your fault and should have used better judgement). I'd figure that after you have picked up some substances more than twice the drug dispensers would figure you know what you're doing by now and instead of asking you a list of questions, they just ask something like ""you gonna be cool?"" as a general pleasantry. 

Of course drugs wouldn't be the only focus to this new anti-nation. I would get some of the best people together to draft up a new type of constitution which focuses on personal freedoms that do not violate the rights of any other citizen. Like say you're some freak that's into raping people. Well, that's not gonna fly here cause that will hurt someone who doesn't want to be hurt. However, I guess that if there are people out there who actually like to get raped (I'm good on all that myself), you two should feel free to get together and do whatever it is you're into. We don't base our laws off of things like 'decency' or any other outdated sense of morality many countries on this planet have based their archaic and often broken systems off of. If you want to do something and it doesn't hurt anyone else (or the environment, the country as a whole, or anything else like that), then go fucking do it. 

I could probably keep going on here, but I've made this long enough. I don't know how many of you dope fiends(<3) are gonna read all this, but if you did I hope you enjoyed it. 

TL;DR: Read it.

I've been fighting cancer for about five years now (which is actually how I got hooked on opiates), and recently have gotten the official news that my cancer has spread to the point where I only have a year left.

I want to live out my last year as best as possible, and while I do opiates for the euphoria, I also use them to manage pain and shortness of breath. I would usually buy from a dealer but after a recent fentanyl incident, I've become too scared to buy from the streets anymore. I even tried the DNM and got fentanyl again.

I so badly just want to live my last year out without having to worry about OD'ing or about shortness of breath or about anything at all. But when I asked my oncologist for opiates, she said that she knew I ""just wanted to get high like all the other near-death patients"" (I have never done anything to indicate that I abuse opiates). She said that when I'm close enough to death she will give me opiates, but I don't want to wait that long, and I already know she'll give me such small doses that it won't even be recreational.

What do I do? Do I tell her I'm an addict and want my fix, and that if she doesn't give it to me I'll start shooting heroin? Or do I wait it out?

For reference, this is in Canada.",1481751552.0

My father who had symptoms that resembled schizophrenia from falling 14 feet on to his head. Whenever he'd take Percocet, all of the craziness went away. He was 100% normal. He passed away three years ago, I think he'd still be alive if he had an unlimited supply of oxy everyday. 

My mother's bi-polar was balanced out from taking methadone pills. All of those anti-psychotic meds would strip her personality. I hated it. But opiates took all of her Bi-Polar away while she was on them. Most success with methadone. My poor parents. I wish they didn't have to suffer and I wish they were still alive.

My uncle who is always on a power trip becomes very giving and emotionally open when he takes his Percocet... as the days go on and he starts mixing Xanax with them, he becomes a total dick. Those Xanax are horrible. But on his Percocet that he's prescribed (both), he's 100% normal. 

And me, all of my social awkwardness, anxiety, you name it, all goes away..

Why do opiates specifically do this? I understand the mechanism of action within the body and what not, but fuck man, it's the best medicine if taken mindfully. It's like an icy lake, you walk nice and slow, you'll be find, but once you start running ahead and rushing, you'll sink right in and drown.

I decided I wanted to get a bag as it's basically my weekend and can only pick up between mon-wed as I'm working those days and only time I'm on the city and able to pickup. Managed to get a lol extra cash due to a chargeback of a paymen taken by mistake, money tight atm due to Christmas. Anyway this will be my last bag till payday whenever that is. But I digress, so in order to pickup I need to head to other side of city so had to take an extra 30mins on lunch to get there, actually turned into an hour due to part of the story QQ

Anyway managed to go pickup and stopped off in a department store on way back to work for a line. Racked it up in the disabled stall as only one that was available at the time. Now, our bags unfortunately don't come in stamp bags but small corners? Of plastic bags and such (one sec I will post a pic ;P) 

http://imgur.com/uTZSGZp

So after I get what I need I like to twist in back up then folder it over and wrap in a rizla (that took so long to type, god damn pirate eye and auto correct lul), so ya I had taken my back out my pocket. Yada Yada had my line, wrapped my dope back up, put my jacket back on and left to head back to work. I had walked a good 5-10mins back to work when I went  to roll a smoke and suddenly realised I couldn't find it! FUUUU, there wasn't too much backy left and I had another fresh pouch back in my bag at work BUT the pack I had left in the toilet (I knew right away that's where I had left it ;p) had my filters (only smoke menthol roll ups. Can't stand non menthol roll ups and I love the taste ^^). So it was time, I turned 180 and ran back to the store up the 2 floors, praying the whole way that no one had binned them etc
So I got upto the toilets on the second floor and it was quite busy, ah shit >.> went along to the last cubicle and an old guy had just stepped in as I went to open the door, I could see my back on the wee hand rail on the side and there old guy said he would be quick. So I waited a couple mins, happy to see my backy was still there. Right enough the old guy was only a couple mins and as he came back out he had my badly in his hand and was just about to put it in his pocket the old bastard!! So I told him it was my backy and he handed it back, opened it up and none of the skins or filters where inside and I said to him there where filters and skins there. He says oh sorry I put them in my pocket so he gets them out and gives them to me. I swear there was less backy in it aswell when I got it back too.. not sure if he stole a bit for himself then intended to hand it in to lost & found.. old people are strange 🙃

Then I headed back to work and was only an hour longer for my lunch, explained to boss I was doing some shopping at lunch and would need longer and he was k about it so all good =D

Had a break after an hour for 2 cheeky lines, you'll see them in my other post. Managed to stop at a pharmacy on way back too and pickup 2 one hit kits (we get free clean and sterile rigs here in the UK, along with clean spoons, filter, sterile water and Citric, I'll post a pick of h one I have left tomorrow before prepping my shot, on bus and pretty high rn lol

At end of work I prepped a shot before leaving which I was gna do later tonight. Although as you guys told me th other day it's better to prep and then shoot rather than lace it sitting for xy time so decided to just shoot it there before leaving. Makes the bus journey home 10x better atleast!

Sorry for the long ass post but I felt like typing it out and some of you may enjoy it and find the bit about the old dude funny helps pass the time on bus too, halfway home now!

I get to my hotel, get in my WALLET, those girly smooth clutches that a lot of females have, and what do I find? Half a joint. My wallet was in my carry on. I face palmed so hard for not being more careful. But it gets better!

So coming back I decided to take the checked bag advice and threw my spoon, and cottons in there (sadly no dope) and called it good. I didnt take my rigs because I felt like they'd stand out. I get home and everything is grand. Guess what I find in my luggage? 5 brand new rigs that I had completely forgotten about. Not to mention the half a bag I just shot that had been lodged in my wallet.

So invited him to my place for a charge(Iv heroin) as I had just scored a teenth(1.8g) we had a couple of hits over a couple of hours and caught up on old times . He was my last co-pilot as I've not been in prison for about 4 years and got on methadone that sentence and had a good laugh at how wasted I was through my sentance and he told me some stuff that I had no memory of at all haha 
   I went and visited him a couple of more times always going with something as you don't want to go to someones house empty handed and I was bored and could do with some company that I could do drugs with/ in front of. 
  So anyway on Monday I went up to his and had a charge and he told me he gets paid today/Wednesday and if I could get him a weight and told him that was no problem at all and he said he would square me up for all the charges i'd given him . Though I really wish he hadn't and had just turned up in the morning instead of promising me shit as I wasn't really expecting anything back as he's just moved into a new house by his self and know he's struggling for cash. 
   So I went and saw him yesterday and asked if it was still on for tomorrow and told him I had said to my guy as he normally doesn't deliver early in the morning but he owed me a favour as he messed me around yesterday and I needed to go to college in the afternoon . 
        I set my alarm last night for 8;45 expecting my friend to turn up about 9 or half nine but nope he's a no show. So about 9;50am I phone my guy and order a teenth for myself and tell him to cancel the other one as my mate hasn't turned up. My guy is on point this morning and is at my house in about 10 minutes :) 
       It really pisses me off when people break their fucking word ! It's not so much having him return what I had given him but more the gesture and for all he knows I was skint and relying on that charge to get me through the day . Which thnkfully wasn't the case ! I even said to him the other day that I cut people off that don't ""pass the ball back""  and just take and take and when they get something they fuck off. I should have known he wouldn't show up as he said he came for me the other day and I know for a fact he didn't because at the time he said he came I was listening out for my guy to make a delivery and was extra aware of what was happening outside as I was listening for my guys car/horn .
         I wonder if he'll try and say I wasn't up because like I said I made sure I was up in the morning or some other lame excuse . Oh well fuck it just one less person I'll share my drugs with !!  
   All the best guys from Scotland and hope you are all good and not WD through lack of funds or worse you've got cash but no one has anything !! Happy nods peeps !",1481743447.0

But now I feel better and here's why...

FUCKING KRATOM!!!! For those who don't know, Kratom is a plant whos roots (citation needed) are ground into a powder that CAN mimic opiates in NON OR LIGHT USERS. That being said, after a few days of pain and regret I was able to find some reliable non-headshop kratom. I got it today from a dude after a long ass drive. Made myself wait till I got home (delaying pleasure makes me cum) to draw some of the nasty, nasty powder into a tea. It's like donkey dick, like wet, been in another donkey, donkey dick, but it works. I'm not only not sick anymore, I actually feel good. Not omg I got a roxy good, but good enough that I finished the Goddamn dishes.

I say all this to help people out. Last time I withdrew this bad I almost killed myself, got off reddit and facebook for 3 months and made my family think I was dead. Then Kratom. It's not an opiate, it's not really a great substitute for opiates, especially if you IV, as there is a cross tolerance effect, however if your in wd, haven't had any, or are a non addicted user (like I was for the first seven years.....) Kratom can be pretty good. I'm not couch locked I actually feel as if I took a potentiator combo, a 7.5 oxy, and smoked a decent bowl of kush (is there any other weed to smoke), so it's like banging a buck, but it's cheaper than anyother form of opiate or opiate agonist I've ever found (my area pills run $1+/mg and boy from fucking 25 a point, but I also Keith Richards my shit) at only $20 for 15 grams from waterbeds and stuff or other headshops. I hope this helps some poor SOB on the downswing.

For harm reduction purposes I'll say this, it goes without saying, doesn't need said and is pointless to say here.... so here it is: don't mix opis and kratom unless you're experienced. The combo may seem legit but they drugs while acting similar sort of potentiate each other. Proof? This prolly don't count; I potentiate opiates with weed and diph., and so 1 day I had a 15 rox (half a trio) and about 5 caps of kratom (5gs). I took the kratom and the roxi a half hour after taking the diph and then smoked about 20 minutes in. Idk if it was this that or the other thing, but I went from being nice and mellow to literally being too high. I used to blow down 2 30's to wake up and I was le-fucking-git to GODDAMN HIGH. I felt at once separated from my body and collapsed into it. Like a big blanket had fallen over me, and sucked me into a black hole of nausea and anxiety. I was literally shaking. That doesn't mean no one can mix them, and hell maybe I just had a panic attack, but still, don't mix shit without experiance, or do what you want, I love you enough to step aside and let you do it, no more poetic than ""not my fucking problem"" love yall. For those who do use Kratom as a straight replacement for opiates....has it worked? I wanna get clean (at least for awhile, or enough so that getting high doesn't require a loan) and was hoping Kratom could be the way. I fear however that it may come with just as bad WD, someone even told me he would literally choose H WD over Kratom WD, called it the Hell for people who sin in Hell. Scares me a bit, but right now I aint sick, fuck it, fuck it all O,,o",1481732190.0

**1st drug:** *methadone*

started day with my normal daily dose of 50mg methadone.

**2nd drug:** *Cocaine*

been using LOTS of cocaine as of late but slept a tiny bit the night before. then started right back in(paranoia starts about HERE). i had about an 8-ball of FIRE left over. i was IV'ing shot after shot every 30min-hr until about 4 hours ago when i finally ran out... ...

**3rd drug:** *heroin*

buddy of mine needed to cop some. so i decided id cop some too. i mean what the fuck right? im already on methadone but the massive amount of cocaine use tempted me to find a calming agent. this was around 7-8pm. since this point i began doing speedball shots in every other or every third shot... boom.

**4th drug:** *xanax*

when i helped my buddy cop and ended up copping as well, the D-man offered up 2 2mg bars. i took that offer... i took both at once when i felt SUPER nervous about going to the methadone clinic about 5 hours ago... (i had just done my LAST shot of cocaine. popped the 2 bars. then followed by doing my final H shot before driving myself the 3-5minutes to the clinic **(NEVER DRIVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE!!! THIS IS WORSE THAN EVERY DRUG I DID. REMEMBER, YOU ARE PUTTING OTHERS AT RISK AS WELL.)** granted it was a 2 minute drive, it was still dumb. i couldve walked, it wouldve taken like 20-30 minutes tops

**5th drug:** *methamphetamine*

the moment i got home from the methadone clinic, i was jonesing hard for some cocaine... well, my C-man is fresh out, and i wasnt trying to keep that going anyway. i went crackhead mode on my house(wanted it fully cleaned anyway, finding a substance would just be a plus lol). what did i find? thats right. half gram of ICE i had hidden away about a month ago. BOOM BOOM BOOM. .1 shots at a time which... FUCK@#@#$! HITS SO FUCKING HARD. just did my last .1 because apparently i needed to keep blasting off each time the rushy super crazy fucked euphoria would START to wear off.

anyway, i feel completely off my rocker and in outer space atm. i wont even include this next one as a *drug* in comparison to the rest, but my buddy next door shared a spliffy with me this morning when i went out for a morning cig(add nicotine as well i suppose).

so in total? if you include THC and nicotine as *drugs*(which is exactly what they are, just not HARD drugs compared to the rest), we are looking at **7 substances** total in a 24 hours period. 3 of which are basically known to be one of the deadliest combinations known to man(adding alcohol wouldve been the kicker?)...

anyway everyone... im officially cleaned out the house of ALL drugs lol. they are ALL *safely* in my body now. i feel so fucking tweaked! why did i have to find meth? a downer wouldve been great to go with it for tonight... at least the mdone and massive H-use is still in me strong enough to keep from the half g ice coursing through me to not be a straight away heart explosion... right?!

DAMN!!!!!!!! i think i went too hard. lets hope thats IT for a while. thats the goal for sure. i called out of work today... and yesterday... cant keep doing THAT either obviously.

so heres to staying clean! hope everyone else is having a GREAT and PRODUCTIVE day <3",1481731998.0
