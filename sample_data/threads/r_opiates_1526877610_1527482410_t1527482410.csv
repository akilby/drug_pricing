8mne1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8mne1s/tianeptine/,0,https://redd.it/8mne1s,RankedAmateur,Tianeptine,"Hello all

I just wanted to type up a quick post suggesting tianeptine to those who enjoy opiates - I took 350mg about an hour and a half ago and am definitely feeling pretty good. This is a pretty high dose but I was looking to experience it on a recreational level and have some tolerance to opiates with recent use. If you decide to try it, work your way up don’t use my dose as a benchmark, everyone’s biochemistry and tolerance are different. That being said this drug doesn’t cause much respiratory depression and has a great safety profile. I’ve heard withdrawals can be pretty rough but don’t plan on using it very often, despite using other opiates with more regularity. It definitely has opiate activity at this dose - my mood is quite elevated, and my pupils a bit constricted. If I stay still I’ll “nod” in a way, not to the extent of a large dose of other opiates but I’ll kindve close my eyes for a bit and not want to open them. I’ll also add that I am starting to get than opiate itch, which I personally enjoy. Even though my dose is mostly just starting to kick in, I’ve read that the duration is extremely short, 2-4 hours with the sodium salt. Can’t comment on the sulphate version of this compound currently but I did get some for future experimentation.

I’ve used this drug a long time ago with no tolerance - I forget what amount, but it was definitely a recreational dose and I had no tolerance at the time. The nod on the occasion was much stronger along with extreme pupil construction. So for people new to opiates, again, use good judgement ingesting, it can be stronger than what I’m making it out to be currently.

This drug has a lot going for it in that it is relatively cheap, legal, and has nootropic qualities. Worth researching if that kindve thing is of interest to the reader. It’s a unique opiate in that it is a tricyclic antidepressant, not a traditional opiate but demonstrates mu and delta agonist qualities with no kappa affinity. In layman’s terms, it effects the brain in the way that an opiate with desirable qualities would at larger doses.

I wanted this to be a quick informative dip your toes in the info type post, ill end it here and go back to enjoying my high.

If anyone has any experience or info regarding tianeptine, feel free to add it. For those with questions, I’ll try my best to answer them with the preface I’m no expert on it or pharmacology.

Thanks for reading and consider trying it if you enjoy opiates.

Thanks for reading all!

Relapsed, almost killed myself about 3 times driving on heroin, benzos, and alcohol (with a pending DUI mind you). Got kicked out of the house, roommate steals my macbook and my camera. And now my girl found out I took her bars and told me shes probably leaving me (I'm thinking she wont but I still feel wretched because I love the piss out of her) and she doesn't even know I went on a week heroin bender. Also left an implied suicide note for my baby sister to find and traumatize the fuck out of her.

Luckily I didn't slam anything and I got about two weeks of squatting essentially at my grandparents to figure some shit out but man am I spinning rn. I think Layne Staley once said 'used to be curious, now this shit is sustenance'. It's like something I can never run away from, and since I'm still battling wicked depression, trauma, anhendonia from being of opiates I've been substituting other downers even before the relapse. I guess it's just time to buckle down and get some mental health and addiction related support and try and preserve. I also lost my card and wont have money till Thursday and ate my 2 bars I had saved for detox right now on day one because of the s/o. 


Did I mention I lost my job for calling in to support my lady while she had a medical procedure and then showed up high the next day, like nodding standing up high.


Man I really screwed the pooch here. But all is not lost. I just really dont want to lose the girl, shes a real gem and I love her more than life itself at times(yes I know that I at times engage in borderline codependency with her). But my best friend from birth who doesn't even drink seems to have secured a really cheap room and wants me on my feet so I am grateful for that and having a room to kick dope in.

 Any kind words or advice would really brighten my day. No negativity please, I have enough guilt as is and I know everyone of you regulars here have done this or worse a million times over. Precisely why I post here. I'm gonna hit a meeting tomorrow, get a sponsor, and get in it to win it or I'm shooting dope on the street again or in box.

TL/DR
Relapsed, almost died, got kicked out, a roommate stole computer, stole from gf and she may leave me, lost my job, and left my baby sis a suicide note now I'm all fucked up but not going back to junk

much love, 
if theres anyone on here who remembers me, esp. tinychat please chime in

I live in the UK and am on diamorphine (pure heroin) maintenance.

I get 7 packs of 5 100mg injectable ampules once a week from the chemist. It costs me £28 a week.

The heroin is pure and I just mix it with sterile water and inject it intravenously.

I feel completely normal and live a completely normal and functional life with a well-paying job and a family. I have been for 15 years since being able to access legal pure heroin.

All the problems I experienced back in the day that are blamed on “heroin” are really the result of the PROHIBITION of heroin.

But a week feels like an eternity when you're not using. In the past 5 months I've gone maybe a few days without using. I'm thinking of seeing my old psychiatrist and confessing and maybe hopefully getting some comfort meds and psychological help. What should I do ? You guys are nothing but supportive. I love this community. I'm very proud of you guys when you post how long you've been clean for. I want to be just like that. The cravings absolutely kill me. I think I'm more addicted to the feeling of getting well than the actual high. I don't even get high anymore. My bank account is non existent. I can't go on like this anymore.  What are my options? Other than cutting myself off from this world. Love you guys. Take care of yourselves please. This is the worst life we could possibly live. It's crazy to think how much your life can change in less than a year due to these drugs. ",1527455833.0
8mkrul,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8mkrul/hey_yall_quick_story_about_the_great_night_i_had/,4,https://redd.it/8mkrul,PatsyClinesDaughter,Hey y’all. Quick story about the great night I had last night (If anyone even cares),"So I haven’t really seen any of my parents’ friends whom I’d always go see when I was younger, (I’m 21 btw). So, yesterday I went with my dad and sister to my dad’s friend, my “Uncle” Ricky’s house, (if you’re Italian you’d understand that, considering he’s not really my uncle). He actually just called me but that’s irrelevant. 

So i went over to his house yesterday “sober” just off about 2.25 mg of Alprazolam and some bud. 
*Quick backstory*
The other night I stole my dad’s car to attempt to score which was a bust but regardless my parents found out. So when my dad told me about the party I said I’d probably go, and my dad texted me the day after I stole the car and said, “Ricky really wants you to come to the party.” So I said, that’s fine, I’ll go, but on my soul if it turns into a mini Intervention I’m going to be pissed.” So he said it wouldn’t, whatever. So we get there, I’m high just from the bars and loud and I’m saying hi to people. 

I’m so not used to being around Italians, even though I am predominantly Italian. Sicilian, whatever. 

I went up to this one older gentleman whom my dad knew and I guess I had met a lot back when I was 7 or so. Anyway, I went to shake his hand and nope, kiss on the cheek 😘. So cute I didn’t mind at all. 

Anyways, I sit down at the adult’s table, essentially, and I meet this man named Tom. Okay y’all from the second I sat down I was just... mesmerized by him. Very cute, older, extremely sarcastic and goofy and... ugh, I can go on for forever. Was in the Army for 20 years, plays PC games like I do... let me stop. So me and him were somewhat briefly discussing my H, amongst other things, use, and he was telling me about how he’s been sober from 20 years and that he used to fuck with Meth and Vodka. Well... there’s the Grey Goose bottle in front of us and I was pouring a shot for myself. 

I was like, “Oh my God I’m so sorry, is this a trigger?” He’s like, “20 years 😊” so I said, “And do they ever go away?” “Nope”, so I said “Exactly, lol”. 

Long story short, after him and I talked her had me talk to his wife and y’all.... I cried, it was but wasn’t like anything anyone else has said to me. Of course I was drunk by that point but regardless she did say some relevant things.

And the funniest of all? 
It did turn into a lil mini intervention but I didn’t even care. 

TL;DR, had a great night, got drunk, and realized some shit regarding my use.",1527455387.0
8mko3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8mko3d/our_first_jj_experience/,6,https://redd.it/8mko3d,AgingHippieLiberal,Our first JJ experience,"So last night my SO and I were sick, we hit our dude up and tried to get a 50 but he said he’s out. Fuck. He’s our only connect. So I made a post on CL and Whisper trying to figure something out, and while I was waiting on a response we decided to try and cold cop. We don’t live in a major city so this is way easier said than done. 

We’re walking around the “bad” part of town (the worst part of where I live is no where near dangerous by any definition of the word...or so I thought), talking to random people asking the usual questions when some big black dude runs up on us with a glock and takes my fucking wallet. Now we’re sick AND we’re broke. 

We cut our loses and start heading home. The only responses to my posts so far were the usual “give me head and I’ll give you a G” type shit and we’re having none of that. Then a dude asks “what are you looking for” (all I said in the CL post was that I was in pain and they don’t have my meds at the pharmacy). After I explain what we need and that we just got robbed this guy said if I can make it to him he can help us out. 

This dude gave us a .30 for free just because we were struggling. All he asked for in return is that we try to hook him up with any single chicks we know. Matt, idk if you use this Sub at all, but if you’re out there, thank you man. You’re a fucking saint. ",1527454431.0

Whats up ya'll? Been lurking here for a long time, I've recently come out of the closet with my habit in hopes I can maybe help a few people on this road we all love and hate so much. I'm 27, been a daily pot smoker for 11 years, was a daily drinker for 3 years and an opiate freak for the last 5 (they helped me kick the booze) :P..was prescribed Vicodin for 2 weeks followed by Tramadol for a skateboarding injury, my doc kept feeding me Tram for 2 years afterwards, think he felt bad because my ankle was not re-set before it was casted, healed a bit weird and still hurts to this day. When he cut me off, the withdrawals sent me into a hellish spiral of major depression and hardcore withdrawal as my daily dose was up to 300 mg per day, he refused to put me back on the hydro. 

 As a result i started looking for other shit and was quickly introduced to the beauty of harder opi's, namely blues and dilly shields, they kicked the ickies of coming off of Tram completely and honestly, gave me a feeling of peace and normalcy that ive never had before. I suddenly started making tons of friends, got more than enough attention from chicks (who sometimes just wanted me for my drugs or to ""fix"" me, i got off on letting them try). And honestly my work and social life just improved overall, I loved the lifestyle and all that it came with..better yet, i could afford it. I won $5,000 on the lottery at the peak of my use also which did me absolutely no good, i bought as many blues, 15's and dilly's as i could afford, blew the 5 g's in 3 weeks and had the best summer of my life..was up to 5 blues n 2-3 dilly's a day at my peak.

And then it came to a screeching halt. I lost my main plug, my online plug pulled an exit scam (he didnt rip me off personally, ironically he sent me my shit and disappeared 2 days later with a bunch of other peoples money), and i was forced to start a new job with less hours all at the same time. Since then, i've made it by on consistent monthly scripts (not my own) of 60 K-56's, 90 5 and 30 7.5 MG hydro, like 10 mscontin 30's cuz the dude only gets 30 and refuses to sell more..but these are my regular pickups monthly these days..and very occasionally, random treat bags such as this, the even more occasional point or two of boy..dboy sometimes calls trying to off some OP 40's that ill usually always grab asap, im partial to pills and will always look for em before i break down and grab a couple bindy's during rough times. My connections to better shit these days absolutely suck, which is probably a good thing for me..however no part of me wants to fully quit or go for treatment, yet. My use is nowhere near what it once was, but im still able to blow through 15 of the K-56's in a day, script of 60 typically lasts me a week tops, i pop hydro daily just to keep me straight and am always on the lookout for better shit, it sucks but i love it.

I dont know why im tellin ya'll all this this, guess there just arent many people i relate to IRL and i enjoy talking about drugs. Seem like a cool bunch of likeminded people here, im always down to talk if someones fucked up and needs an ear to bark at, always down to give advice or help out in any way that I can. I got alot to say and plenty'a good stories to share, hope ya'll have a good n safe holiday weekend. Sorry if this pic link doesnt work right, these are 3 blues and a few 15's i just got an extremely rare and lucky call on..funny i was just telling someone here how much i missed the U23's..the opiate gods heard my plea, sadly it's already almost gone :( hence the long winded, chatty post.",1527453794.0

If it's pain and only pain, fuck this is still annoying as fuck. She is covered in bruises from scratching ""from pain"", and she won't stop cleaning and working and fixing around the house even though she's clearly in an incredible amount of pain. And dear god is she fucked up. Nodding out 3 days straight at this point all day. Either cleaning or sleeping and she says she doesn't sleep at night but she does. It's only 5mg codeine, but she still has the mountains of my pills so I'm sure she's mixing at least during the periods before she gets tested, which is right now since she just had the appointment. She just made herself a third Irish coffee and keeps yelling around loudly at me and the dog and she's just impossibly fucked up. I get fucked up, this is ridiculous. She's not even herself. She said she is drinking because she took the last painkiller at 4am and it's now noon, but regardless she's fucked. I can't possibly understand how nobody in my family sees this but me. I know she's probably maybe in pain, maybe not though. I don't usually doubt her pain, but why does she need to get this fucked up. She's smoking weed like it's air but whatever that's not something I care about. I told her I thought she was trashed and that I really don't care unless you try to drive with me, to which she responded ""don't drive with me"". I want to record her, she doesn't get this fucked up when the rest of the family is home, but she does at times so it's not like they haven't seen her like this. I'm fucking done, I found a half drank beer and half eaten cup of grapefruit juice on the bathroom counter two nights ago. She has valium, painkillers, and whatever else she fucking wants all at her disposal. I know she's lived this long doing this without dying but holy shit this is scaring me. If this is her at the lowest amount of opioids they will give her holy fuck I am not excited for her to have a solid dose. And I hate calling my own mother this but she's a mean vindictive bitch when she's this fucked up. I'm hiding from her but she fucked upedly bangs on my door every half hour asking me to do shit with her and hang out with her and smoke and watch TV with her. This is heartbreaking I want her to get help. I said she should take kratom instead and she took me saying that as saying she should take it in addition because it won't show up on the screening, so I guess now I'm hiding all my kratom. Wish me luck. Come August I'm  moving out and never moving back. I have a job now by the way, still don't drive but I don't think that's changing any time soon. ",1527444012.0

**2nd Question**, If I do a large extraction, 500 pills for example, what would be the best way to store the solution so it wont get ruined? Would storing it in an Amber vial in a dark place be enough?

I may or may not be  traveling out of the country and I was wondering how easy/hard is it to travel with a personal amount of H.  Have you, or perhaps a friend, had any experience traveling with H through the security checkpoints at your local airport? 

Would emptying out a few pills and refiling them suffice?

Until the fent order hits a local delivery node, I'm stranded on a backwards planet with eight milligrams of an orange-flavoured local 'delicacy' known to Earth's denizens as... sabbaxan?

I do not post much, but have been a dedicated lurker for almost a year now, basically since I started. 
I become incapacitated when I withdraw. 
Crippling depression, the worst RLS ever, crazy insomnia, emotions just up/down/left/right all over the place, and killer cravings. 
I started on Kratom about 2 years ago, mthen moved to a legal opiate high that shall not be named, and then jumped to Heroin when I found a reliable dealer.
I have only been using Heroin for about 8 to 10 months. 

My current habit is 5-8 tiny bags a day up the nose. This has grown from a recent 1 week bender where I've been doing 5-8 bags per day. 
I held a steady habit at 2-4 bags per day, but that restraint has fallen by the wayside. 
Never IV'd. 
Should I taper my dose down to one bag spread across the day? Or am I shallow enough to just jump CT? 
My question is how long should I take off work to get back close to my normal self? 
I am working and going to school trying to finish up my degree. I live alone. I must keep my job to be able to exist (rent, food, bills, GF). 
 I plan to go to my grandmother's house and just ride it out with as many comfort medications as I can get my hands on. Black seed oil, Xanax, lopermide, Magnesium Sulfate, Fish oil, Krill Oil, B Complex vitamin, Red Bali Kratom (GAIA), Kratom Extract (MOBotanicals), Phenibut, Tiantipine sulfate, Noopept, Creatine, one 7.5 Hydro, and as much exercise as I can muster (Running, Lifting, & Cycling)
Is this doable? 
It's crippling knowing my day and night depend upon a D boy.

I saw my psychiatrist last week but I had slightly downplayed my use to mum (who was there with me) and didnt ask for any withdrawal meds. I wanted to do it alone; yet 48 hours later the withdrawals were notably worse this week, my usual 20mg of lope wasnt providing relief and I was cold to the bone, sweating profusely, dissociated and freaking out. I ended up copping that day. I then contacted my psych with a suggestion of doing an at-home short term detox involving suboxone, diazepam and lyrica (that I will be sourcing myself). My psychiatrist has been following me for years with my mental health woes, is also awarr of passed MDMA, alcohol and marijuana abuse yet seems to be very trusting of me. He not only called me back within an hour, he also directly called up a GP specializing in substance disorders and referred me to see him first thing tomorrow. He is totally comfortable with the meds and suggestion I suggested which is amazing. He's truly an *awesome* psych.

I have a bit of a question tied to this post as well. Given a small amount (say a weeks worth of suboxone and diazepam) detox meds; what would my short detox/taper look like? Like specifically regarding doses per day? At this point in my use I can stay well on and cop a tiny buzz from like 0.2-0.3. But typically use at least half a G or more to have a dope day. I have used moderatrly in the last 3 days and will be today until tomorrow.Any advice is *truly* appreciated. And thank you to everyone here who has been so kind in providing reassurance and support!

I know urine retention affect most opiate uses but mine is out of control and really ruins the experience everytime I use.

I try every trick in the book to try and piss from showers to leaning forward to standing to sitting to knees up to pressure on bladder to warm water on hand or dick in warm water nothing.

The only time I can finally piss is around 8 hours after last use. It's to a point where I just can't enjoy the buzz because I know I'm going to sit there in pain for hours trying to pee.

I use fairy small amounts and take regular breaks so my tolerance is not that high. Is this something that people have noticed gets better as their tolerance goes up or its always a problem.

Another thing is I never had this issue much with oxy and dillys just morphine and heroin.

8mcxw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8mcxw9/as_far_as_derrick_is_concerned_cliff_might_as/,6,https://redd.it/8mcxw9,sloan_fitch,"As far as Derrick is concerned, Cliff might as well have jumped off of himself.","Yesterday evening Derrick, the neighbor who serves as Cliff's primary middle called to drop by and talk briefly. So after dinner I came by to speak. First a little catch\-up because he had a business idea weeks earlier that I wanted to hear about. Basically the idea involved drones to deliver goods, which is actually what Amazon has been working towards. I speculated that it would be risky for a fledgling company since the laws and regulatiosn for such venture are incomplete. Still, kicked ideas around and discussed what's presently going on and the possibilities as well as the current developments with regard to self\-driving cars.

&nbsp;

Anywho, I gave him some weed that I wanted him to try last week and he gave me some weed he had and also showed me his recently obtained batch of allegedly uncut dope. During our interaction he also asked me about Cliff as he went on to describe Cliff's recent behavior and communications to be very shady. Briefly I gave him a run\-down of my interactions with Cliff over the past week or two. Things like, ""I gave him the option to buy subs right after pay day, he said he didn't want or need any. Then he said he did but kept postponing only to have him ask if I could spare half a sub a week later."" I went on to confirm that Cliff was well in between pay checks while approaching script day.

&nbsp;

Regarding script day; I told Derrick if he ever get's told by Cliff that a certain day is script day that he could feel free to contact me to validate such a detail. Derrick went on to show me some text messages so that we'd be on the same page. Cliff fucked Derrick by accepting a bundle of dope on loan from him. Derrick paid full price for that and ended up having to scrap some silver in order to get the money to pay his dboy back. It was very important to him that he paid the dboy because he depends on him to come through when he makes an order so he knew he had to do right by his plug. 

Cliff's lies to Derrick and the promise to pay Derrick back depended upon Cliff getting his script on Wednesday. The text messages indicated he ran into a snag, but still showed optimism. Specifically, he claimed his local supermarket did not have the oxy script in stock so a text stated, ""They have it at the supermarket on the far end of town. I'm getting a cab now."" Followed by more postponements and stories. In fact, in order to testify that his lies were fact Cliff said in one of the messages ""my mom is in agonizing pain.. I have the receipt I can show you."" Now, I don't really understand what the receipt proves if he didn't even pick up the script; the receipt is what you get after paying for the script and getting it filled. I suppose he was claiming that the pharmacy gave him a receipt to indicate that they are in the process of filling the script. Not really sure but it doesn't matter because he's full of shit.

&nbsp;

Derrick didn't even bother asking to see the receipt, why bother wasting time reading and listening to a string of BS. In fact, Derrick is done with Cliff. Really \(very likely\) done serving, assisting, middling and/or dealing with Cliff \-\- no more. All the more reason not to ever go through Cliff if I ever wanted to buy myself dope again. I could just imagine the increased delays now that his only decent middle is no longer assisting him. That said, I'm really trying not to buy dope again from anyone. If I bought dope, I'd get high for a day... then have to take subs again, possibly more than the 2mg I've been taking. As I stand right now, I may not even need to buy more subs before the completion of my taper schedule. If I get myself down to 1mg in the next four days, I would still have a 16 day supply of subs at 1mg. If I bought dope on pay day, I'd probably have to buy more subs for good measure. So I'm highly motivated not to buy a bunch of dope. I've considered buying a bun and and a half but that money would be better spent on bike parts and clothes. Bar money too so that I can drink scotch while being attracting any lucky women who cross my path. I've been meaning to get myself back on the market. 

&nbsp;

Back to Derrick. He seems quite sincere about being done with Cliff. This last bundle of dope not being paid back in a timely manner was the last straw for him. He also went on to explain that he doesn't need Cliff's business, that he is already in a program and gets methadone daily. He middles because he can for his own pleasure and maybe a little as a favor for friends. This is the longest I remember Cliff being without drugs since Thanksgiving and possibly Christmas. Derrick didn't receive any more messages from Cliff after telling him that he was done serving him and dealing with his bullshit.

&nbsp;

I'm curious to see what Cliff does when he does get paid and has money for dope again. It's not impossible to find someone but I'm so glad that I won't be invovled with such an order under any circumstance. I'd imagine all manner of things would go wrong. If Cliff ran into a shortfall and wanted to have an extra day's of dope, if scamming me made it happen I know he would do it. For example, ""my friend delivered a half a bun, he's bringing the rest later tonight."" Then I'd be waiting as the time approached and Cliff would says ""he's waiting for his wife to go bed before he can sneak out and bring us the rest."" Then as it got later things would get bleak, maybe he'd pretend to make a phone call to his friend for a status update. When faced with such situations in the past I would offer to bike over to his ""friend's"" house to pick up the dope that the guy allegedly already has. On night one it wouldn't happen as we waited for the fictitious friend's wife to go to bed. Come three AM this ""wife"" would either still be up or it would be too late for the ""friend"" to drive over.

Come night two, I'd start early in offering to bike to the friend's house and Cliff would present optimism to that idea. ""Definitely tonight, less likely it'll be delivered"" or some crypic bullshit like that. Eventually I'd arrive at the conclusion that I'm not getting my half bun and a week later would receive pills to cover my loss. 

&nbsp;

Oh snap, I sidetracked and spoke about myself once again. Back to Derrick, again. So he layed out a bundle of dope to help Cliff get well on ""script day."" In reality, it was not script day. He went to the doctor that day but he can't get his script filled until Saturday. This is obviosuly not what he told Derrick. Hence the bullshit about having to get it filled at a pharmacy across town, bs reasons for delays prior to Derrick's messages where he basically states that he is done with Cliff's bullshit. 

Oh shit, brainstorm. It's a good thing that Cliff doesn't know I've directly bought Derrick. Even if he does have a hunch, he is never getting from Derrick again unless Derrick changes his mind. I could imagine Cliff asking me to place an order with Derrick for him. So I'd be middling to see a middle for Cliff. Fuck that. Never going to happen. 

&nbsp;

Bottom line, Cliff screwed his chief middle and is going to regret it. Scratch that. Will he regret that? I remember the time Cliff and Ben gave a fake hundred dollar bill to the dboy who identified it as such right away. The dboy still gave them a price break but obviously couldn't do anything with the fake bill and didn't accept it. One week later, the dboy delivered a batch of dope to Cliff and I. My part of the order was only $40, his share was over $200.

Right after the dboy left, we discovered the batch was 90&#37; fake. I firmly believe that was a result of the prior week's actions but Cliff denied and wouldn't accept that possibility. Thus he did not come to regret his choice of trying to pass a fake note off to his dboy. Just as he wont regret screwing Derrick even though his actions will prevent him from being able to procure through Derrick in the future. He won't have regret because as he lies to Derrick, me \(when he tells me the ""story""\) and himself the root cause of regret is obfuscated in a smokescreen of lies.

&nbsp;

Yes, eventually when Cliff is feeling better and more talkative he will contact me and say ""I have a story to tell you about Derrick."" He'll likely paint Derrick as the scumbag liar in the story though I've already saw their last message log so I'll look forward to comparing fact to fiction.

&nbsp;

P.S.\-

I didn't even mention the part where Derrick offered me 60mg of methadone from his take home bottle. Do I accept it? I've been on ever decreasing doses of bupe/subs for over a week. I'm curious what 15 or 30mg of methadone feels like but then I must also ask, ""what could go wrong?"" Well, regardless, Derrick is certainly not going to offer that 'done to Cliff. Had Cliff paid his debt or simply had not lied to Derrick in the first place to get a bun on loan, Derrick would've likely shared his take\-home dose to get help Cliff get well until the real script day.

All my money went to either food or H. I lost everything because of it. But now I have a wonderful relationship with an amazing woman I love dearly. I have a car. A home. A great job that I don't hate and can actually get up in the morning to go to without dreading every second of it.  And I've only been spending what I can afford to spend on opiates for the last 12 months now. 

If I'm ever in a pinch where I can't afford any, I stick with kratom. :) Alternating back and forth between recreational opiate use and kratom maintenance has been the best thing I could've done for myself. I was absolutely miserable when I was sober. I used H daily for 2/3 years. Up to 2gs a day at my worst. I quit cold turkey and was clean for 4 years and though the physical symptoms stopped, the happiness never came back. I never really felt fully myself again. My chronic pain kept getting to me. etc etc. Opiates are the only thing that help my injury/spinal related pain and because of my age it's fucking impossible for me to get anything from doctors. I'm a metalhead with all sorts of piercings, i'm 24, every doctor automatically assumes i'm drug seeking and is hesitant to give me anything at all. I used to go to a Pain management clinic and got 120 5mg vics and 60 10mg oxycodones per month but I stopped taking those and moved out of stated years back and haven't been able to set up a new plan with a new doctor. Either every doctor is too pussy footed to help me because my age/appearance makes me look like a drug seeker, despite my documented medical history, or, I just lost the patience to deal with the health care system and give up trying to get relief through the normal routes. 

So I just started ordering from the darknet over a year ago. 

Everything is functioning perfectly in my life. And has been solidly for 12 months straight. 

I never use H for more than 10 days out of each month. And use kratom for maintenance to not have to deal with WDs and to be able to kill pain at the same time. 

Sometimes you just need something stronger to feel good/really get at the pain. 

It's just so good to be honest. All those years where H was destroying my life and now I've got it by the reigns. 

I know that everyone's going to tell me it's a dangerous game and that sooner or later i'll fall through the cracks, but i've been there already, and I sincerely don't see it happening. Because every time I've been unable to afford it, well, that's it, I just can't afford it and I move on and wait a few more weeks til I can. 

All my bills are paid and current. I've been successfully paying off debt, and now through all of this, i'm also able to get my beautiful girlfriend the engagement ring she deserves. 

I just want to say thank you to all the amazing people on this sub, you guys are amazing and I absolutely love seeing and sharing all the stories we post here. This is my second home and has been for years. 

So with all that said. I just wanted to say I'm pain free, high as a kite, and going to be able to enjoy my memorial day weekend to the fullest. I wish every single one of you the best this weekend, and every other day moving forward. 

I never thought i'd make it this far and accomplish so much, and I know there is so many more of you out there who feel/felt the same way. Don't let that doubt consume you. You can do it. Whether you're detoxing, or trying to successfully balance an opiate usage and a ""normal"" life, it's possible, and you can find success. 

Wish you all the best. :) <3 ",1527334421.0

If you're the kind of addict I am, you lead a life where the vast majority of people you interact with on a day-to-day basis will never understand or relate to some of the feelings and actions that absolutely drive us, and that we feel every day. 

There are some that are pretty commonly mentioned here, like when you are too sick to even fucking move but man hits you with that ""gud cum thru"" and you suddenly can not only drive, but expertly weave through traffic like Speed Racer racing on speed. I wanna know: what are some of those less talked-about opi feels that you think we can relate to? I have a couple off the top of my head.

1. Itching the SHIT (heh) out of your anus directly. Either with toilet paper protection, or just saying fukkit and going in like me before a eye-opening run-in with the Gon-Tron: bareback and unafraid with extensive washing after. Goddamn feels so GOOD.

2. Eating not because you're hungry, but because you just threw up so you know to enjoy more gear you're gonna need to shove *something* down your raw gullet. I'm doing this right now with some dank Chinese food. And I'm not talkin like a stoner, y'all...

Is it possible to purify or further isolate heroin in #4 form? I just received several gs of heroin that seems to be cut with a stimulant-like substance. 

I don't think it's another drug like meth or cocaine, because there's no euphoria with the rush. It simply increases my heart rate and throws me into a near-panic attack. I have a bad anxiety disorder, and the best way to describe it is like smoking weed, if weed makes you anxious and paranoid like it does me, with a hugely elevated heart rate. 

I have heard of a common cut that feels like a stimulant before, but I can't remember what it's called. 

I'm hoping there's a way to isolate the dope but I am already pretty certain you can't do that without some advanced lab equipment, haha. I know you can sometimes purify it and separate it from the non-soluble cut, but this is probably a different process?

I thought eating was supposed to weaken an opiate high, but then I also read that taking it on a completely empty stomach was also bad. Should I try eating a little bit, and how long before dosing?


Also, if I took hydrocodone yesterday, if I take it today will my high be diminished?",1527291965.0
8m66od,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8m66od/that_time_i_helped_ben_the_benzo_enthusiast_with/,7,https://redd.it/8m66od,sloan_fitch,That time I helped Ben the benzo enthusiast with his sister's kid's iPhones,"""My sister needs to unlock these two iPhones yesterday. I'll give you two blues if you come through and do it."" A couple of days later when I was finally able to come through and help, I spoke to Ben on the phone prior to verify some details. In fact, two nights earlier we also spoke on the phone. I asked him to clarify exactly what he wanted me to do to these phones for his sister.

Does the phones need to have a carrier unlock performed? As in, making an AT&T phone work on T\-Mobile or is there a passcode that he wishes to circumvent? That night he said, ""I'll call my sister, find out and call you back."" Two hours later... ""I guess you forgot about me, let me know if you can meet up tomorrow afternoon tot ake care of this.""

&nbsp;

Forgot about him? When we left off he said that he'd call me back to answer my two questions. The following day when we spoke, he did not have answers to those questions. So prior to coming over I told him that I didn't want to waste my time coming over only to find out there's nothing I can do nor do I want to come unprepared. He told me that he would pay me for my time regardless of the outcome.

&nbsp;

He said it, whether I fix it or not he will pay me what was initially promised to be two blues and a smoke\-up. When I got there he turned up with the wax so he fulfilled that part of the bargain. He also provided me with half a blue while I did my work.

&nbsp;

There is a third type of unlock which I did also try to find out about when we spoke on the phone the night before. Activation lock, or Find My iPhone \(FMIP\) lock which is practically impossible to circumvent. After a restore the device asks you to sign into iCloud, which cannot be bypassed.

&nbsp;

Mind you, when I spoke to this dude on the phone prior, he said he'd pay me whether or not I was successful but even if I was 100&#37; successful, he did not have two whole blues to give me on the spot. Maybe if I had succeded he would've gotten a credit from the person he gets blues from but I doubt it since he wasn't willing or able to do that with the guarantee I'd pay the following day.

&nbsp;

Thus instead of getting paid two blues, I got half a blue. Totally not worth my time. It was okay bonding time I suppose. I didn't cover Ben's melodrama, like when I told him I on the phone that I wanted more detail so that I wouldn't waste his time paying me to do something that couldn't get done. At the time he still assured me he'd pay me regardless and thanked for looking out and not scamming him by triyng to give him a heads up that paying me could very well be a waste since I didn't have enough info from him to know if I could do what was needed.

&nbsp;

Furthermore, he went into a melodramatic tangent where he listed situations where he'd have my back, things like a ""a place to stay if I was locked out"" or something about ""jiggas runnin up"" on me and backing me up in such a situation.

&nbsp;

In conclusion, if someone wants you to unlock an iPhone and isn't forthcoming with information, they probably didn't look into it too deeply and the device is probably activation locked.",1527291882.0

Did these guys just see me as vulnerable? Was I too nice? I'm not a small girl, I can certainly look intimidating. I'm sure guys experience this shit too, but... Idk. Idk. 

Now I feel like I can trust no one. I've always felt that way, but never more than now. I'm so scared. I feel violated and angry and I want revenge.

I see a lot of people mention how much they take a day, but no one ever mentions how much at a time. My tolerance has obviously increased, but I don’t know if 45 mg IR is safe. I’m concerned that my tolerance for the high is up, but does the tolerance for the CNS depressing effects go up too?

While they were kicked out they were given access to the car and are still allowed to return to the house due to my parents fear of them being on the streets, however when he comes over he openly uses in the home and brings stolen merchandise that he spends his days/nights obtaining. He's not allowed to stay the night but it has happened as my parents invite him over during late hours where they don't stay up to enforce his removal. My brothers behavior remains toxic as he persistently questions my parents for money to ""help him out,"" and where his misplaced stolen merchandise may be.

Especially in my town. (Pic inside)","https://imgur.com/a/uF8Jdmf
Here it is, I've successfully tapered down over 6 months of hard abuse, I went from using 6-8 of these caps in a day down to one of those caps lasting me 2 days and able to even skip a day or two between caps without feeling super sick instantly. 
I can say I'm done with it, I feel like I'm done with it, after getting on H I don't even think about oxy anymore, it doesn't do it for me anymore anyway as I don't like the itchy high it gives.
Over the weekend I'll use this as sparingly as possible and once it's done I am done. Hopefully forever. 
I've been testing the w/d boundaries and it looks like I'll be good since I'm on such a low dose just to maintain I can handle going without it without much discomfort. Last time I skipped 2 days beginning of this week and only got chills and sweats for an hour or two and they were mild, and some stomach cramping which a couple of lopes calmed right down. 
So I think I'm ready. Finally. I've read this sight for a few years, only posted a few comments, but it's given me a lot of information to figure out how to do this so thanks to all of you still here struggling, balls deep in the life or been out for years alike, keep helping those who want it and those who don't too.

I never stopped though... I'm truly sorry.

I don't know how big the addiction is atm. I'm 19. It appears that I'm physically addicted now, it's been more than a month daily and nearly 2 months since my first time. Had a longer withdrawal yesterday lasting about 24hrs and I had to take small doses before I ran out. I could barely breathe, walk, my entre body was hurting, especially my back and legs. My heart was going crazy.

I was psychologically addicted instantly as I quitted my alcohol+speed addictions and benzos which I started taking everyday with the alcohol and speed, right before I started with H. I have big problems with my mental health, never gotten any diagnosis, never been ""analysed/evaluated"" by a therapist though.

During my withdrawal yesterday, I lost my cash with no dope, my girlfriend nearly broke up during a phone call. I was so pumped with adrenaline and turned extremely aggressive, I strongly felt like started destroying everything around me. It was bad, I was not myself. It seemed like a mild psychosis.

Nowadays I put heroin as my top priority. Fuck eating/drinking. Fuck sleep. Fuck taking a shower. Fuck school (Dropped out, before H though). Fuck meeting friends. Fuck having a normal life.

Fuck everything, I need to get some fucking heroin first!

Then I can try focus on getting my life together..

Wait, fuck, I need to get cash before I go empty in 3 days. Busy life I see.. At least I can get some relief in all this..

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. If I quit H, I'll just feel like shit and still have my mental problems, which H can ""cure"", at least for now. I'll fall back on a big growing polydrug addiction which is way more damaging in my eyes, and those aren't even that effective.

Also cops, detective and a drug dog in the story. Lol","So I take my buddy to go pickup. I'm doing well with 5 days clean, the worst physically is over but problems sleeping and mental cravings are still driving me crazy. But I persevered and gave my buddy a ride because I owed him some money, I give him a ride in exchange for the owed money and resisted temptation even after him offering to get me high which was a small victory for myself but that's neither here nor there, the copping process is where it got interesting.

As we're sitting at the spot waiting for his dude, it's on the corner of X and X when I noticed this blacked out Impala drive past the next block over for the second time. I mention it to my buddy but we blow it off. It's happened so many times while picking up, probably just another coincidence. At this point we've got two cars ahead of us, generally dude has everyone meet up at the one way street on X and X somewhere throughout the city in an orderly line patiently waiting for the dope man. When he gets there he flashes his lights and we all follow. I've seen the lines get up to like 10 of us before depending on how many people he's got coming through but this particular instance it's just the three of us and I was at the back of the line. He pulls up, flashes and we all follow. He turns into an alley a block or so away and one by one like a drive through people pull up, place there order and hand over the money and pull off waiting for another call. It's generally just a minute or so later the call comes in to meet at X which is usually pretty close to the last spot. We go there and again same cars ahead of us pulling up to the new car, grabbing their dope and driving off. Quick transactions, very professional and punctual dudes like they're running a business. 

You may think this system is convoluted or just inconvenient but it saves his crews ass while one collects money and the amount needed then alerts the next guys around the corner and has them meet and distribute the dope. He never handles the money the other guy never has dope on his hands. I think it's a rather sophisticated and well setup business practice and has never been an inconvenience for myself or anyone else I know that goes through dude. 

Now the blacked out impala from earlier, I'm driving back and I get just out of the neighborhood when metropolitan police SUV rolls up out of know where and flips on the berries and cherries no sooner than I spot him in the rear view. I'm calm, sober and not in possession of any drugs so I'm not really sweating it other than potentially having a warrant from a previous incident. But my buddy just bought $50 worth of caps, having already snorted two he eats the remaining 8 to avoid possible jail time and he's lucky he did. 

The pig comes up and immediately asks where the heroins at and that she's bringing the dog so just give it up now. I'm good and have nothing to worry about so I calmly tell mrs piggy there are no drugs on me or in my vehicle and asked if I was being detained or if I could please go. She's pissy, tells me I'm being detained until back up and the dog arrives. She continues to interrogate me saying she knows I just bought heroin and that they've been investing this particular area for heroin use and I just tell her I don't do drugs and we're hear to meet a man about a pit bull puppy. My buddy and I are on the same page and that's the story we'd come up with a year ago in case a situation like this arose. We rehearsed it again before even speaking with the cop this time around to be sure. 

The canine finally arrives along with two more cruisers. So at this point we've got the initial female cop, the cop with the canine and two more male cops. Four in total for absolutely nothing but they're ready for shit to hit the fan apparently. While the the dog is doing his job going to through every inch of my vehicle they separate my buddy and I and try interrogating us again hoping one will slip up about something incriminating.  This is when the blacked out impala pulls up. Detective Dickstash, I'm assuming he was a detective anyway he was dressed and acted different than the regular metropolitan police, he walks up and immediately starts being an asshole. He tells me they're investigating a dealer in the area and I'm going down if I don't start cooperating, which I'd been 100% cooperative prior to his arrival. I tell him the same thing I told the rest, stick to your story. Don't budge an inch. If they catch you lying or discrepancies in your stories you're just asking for trouble. 

Finally they give up on the dog search as he doesn't hit on anything or find anything but he did manage to destroy my work truck in the process which is always nice. We get one last lecture from the remaining pigs and are told to stay out of the area, if we're caught over here again we're in trouble blah blah same bullshit they always say. As things are wrapping up the detective or whatever come back and isn't being a prick now saying he's just trying to get the ""big fish"" and he saw us and other cars in the area buying drugs, that he knew our story was bullshit but they didn't have anything on us so we were free to go but too again, stay the fuck away from that neighborhood or else blahmuuu

All in all, it wasn't the worst experience I've had with city police, having just wasted and hour of our time and no one went to jail this time. My buddy immediately called up ol boy and told him the pigs were onto them and he said he'd received a call from someone else who was pulled over and went through the same ordeal.

It's the most effective drug at treating my struggles of all that I've tried, and I never get fucked up, just take enough for my pains to go away. I've started to get withdrawals and it'¨s been hell all day. But I have a female junkie friend \(who's 20 years older than me and she's homeless, living in a homeless shelter\). She appears very trustworthy, but every time she's been helping me get H, I usually end up scammed/robbed. First time I got scammed, I got 0,6g when I bought 1,2g \(always weigh my shit\), she gave me half of what I bought. She told me that she got scammed too, and that it wasn't her fault in any way, we went with one of her friends.

Then I got a number from her to meet a friend of her to buy from, it turns out she was a crackhead, and she didn't even sell dope, she took my cash and never came back outside. \(If only I had seen where she went inside..\) My junkie\-friend told me it was my fault. \(Yes, sorry that I actually trust people, learned from those mistakes by now.\)

I tried buying it off the street an early morning after a roll, because I didn't have any H left. Met an amph\-guy who claimed to be selling heroin as well when I asked him. Guess what? I got speed, a weird brown powder and not H. Barely any speed at that weight, but at least I got some fucking drugs that time at least. I ended up smoking all the speed mixed with a brownish powder \(Which wouldn't even melt. I put it on foil, I even literally put it inside a flame and it simply turned black, no smoke. Didn't work shit, although I continued to smoke the whole thing desperately, of course, with the result of having the worst speed I've ever consumed in my system.

Today I met up with my junkie\-friend, we were both dopesick and was going to get some dope together, although of course she brings in other people she knows, and I have to wait for hours. Finally I meet her again, and she's with a girl, and they tell me that her friend's boyfriend ran off with all the money. This time I just KNEW something like this would happen. I was asking if she could join me and sell half a gram of speed to get enough for dope, however she talked about letting her sell it for me and meeting up with her when she had the dope she was going to get with another friend.

She also demanded her old phone back, which I borrowed from her because my last one broke.

At this point we were waiting for her friend. I had enough and simply left her. I knew wouldn't get my dope or cash back anyways, so I went home instead of waiting with her like an idiot while being sick as fuck.

I stood there alone with nothing left except a little weed and half a gram of amphetamine. I've quitted speed, so I didn't want to take it at all. But when I got home, I just said fuck it and took a couple of lines, some weed and a drink to calm down, but I found two 30mg codeine pills too, so all this made me feel a little better temporarily.

Things got a little better however, as I was lucky enough to get a new phone from insurance because the last one broke. I borrowed some cash from a good \(real\) friend, and called a dealer \(which I bought from once, he had the greatest shit I've tried so far, much better than what I've bought from my junkie  ""friend"". I have a huge suspicion that she's been cutting the heroin to make a profit, heroin that's already cutted to hell. Some days ago, I actually tasted speed from some part of the dope I was smoking, and it's funny how I traded speed4dope with her some days before that..\), not expecting him to answer as I've attempted to call him numerous times since I met him the first time. He was my only choice other than the junkie or buying off the streets.

He answered though, he asked who I was and I told him we met before. He was available and he told me he had very, very good dope this time, though it would be more expensive because of that. To afford it, I offered to give him my cash and 0,4g of speed. He actually accepted my offer, and I met him along with two of his buds, and the deal was done in under 5 minutes. I asked if I could just call whenever I need to buy, and he said yes. I've just taken a little bit so far, and it feels much better than what I've tried before.

I've made the decision that I won't deal with \-that\- kind of junkies anymore. Not my ""friend"" either. If she has no blame in all this, and she also got robbed/scammed those times, I still have to leave. She's dragging me into so much bullshit, she won't even give me any numbers to dealers. She wants me to get my dope through her.

I'm done with her anyways. And I'm fucking done losing all my cash and getting sick. From now on I'll have to do this solo. And a drug deal is supposed to last less than 5 minutes, not fucking 5\+ hours of waiting

\(Sorry for long post, just needed to get my feelings out.\)

**tl;dr: got scammed/robbed numerous times to the point of being broke because of a junkie I know, been pretty sick, got in contact with a good dealer later, sold the last of my speed and got my fix in the end.**

  
**EDIT: Sorry if it wasn't clear, but I'm not looking for any sympathy or anything. I just need advice on how to stop being such an idiot. I haven't been thinking straight when I'm too desperate, I just hope I get my product. I'm also young and new to the ""game"".**",1527213574.0

I’m 6 years clean as of two weeks ago. Typical story, started with vics, turned into percs, turned into roxies, turned into H, etc. I pretty much destroyed my entire life and killed myself in the process, or whoever that person was before drugs. But I cleaned up my act. I got my shit together for once and I rebuilt everything. I have a good stable job, trusting family, I’m newly married, my credit score is excellent, and I’m about to start looking at buying a house all by myself. But I can’t stop thinking about heroin. I’ve been clean for a long time and some days are easier than others. Most usually aren’t bad. I usually think about dope every day, but not even in a sense of wanting to do it....just thinking about it. But for the past two weeks all I want to do in the world is get some oxy or some h. Non-stop crowding my mind and it’s making me depressed. I don’t want to struggle anymore. I didn’t think I would have to struggle for so long. I wish I never touched the shit. I have such a good life now, why am I even thinking about throwing it away? Truth be told I know I’m not going to. I moved away from my dope city a long time ago, so I have no connect and I’m not a cold cop type of guy. But if it came into my lap I know I would say yes. Fortunately I’ve distanced myself far enough from that life. I don’t really know why I’m posting this, I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for letting me ramble.

Recently though, i lost my job. And with it my health insurance. My sub dr is in another state and im on 16mg a day. So shit got spendy fast incredibly fast.

Ive had to resort to wheelin and dealin with other sub patients to make ends meet and not be sick.

This week i was 2 days short to my refill. I didnt wanna spend both days sick. Im waiting to start a new job i really need and the second all my stuff comes back theyll likely tell me to come to work now in the same phone call. So im trying to be somewhat well in case that happens too.

I could not find shit this time around as far as bupe goes. My only options were dope, methadone, or go sick. Fuck going back to dope. I really didnt wanna be sick. So......

I broke down and bought 2 10mg methadones. I dont have much experience with the done at all. I live in rural midwest so there hasnt been a clinic near me that does anything but subs. So ive never really had the choice. Ive been okay with that till these last 2 days.

Even just 10mg done a day had me feeling better than the subs. I wasnt so bogged down by a high dose. Having energy was nice. I didnt get sick for a considerable amount of time which was surprising. And most of all i didnt have any cravings. Thats something ive never been able to achieve with subs. I was talking to the dude i got them from and i guess theres a clinic doing done 20 miles from me. Which aint too bad to drive.

I know its a full agonist and all that pharmacology. So i dont need that all explained to me. I just want some personal testimony i guess. Anyone spend a long time as an addict (10+ years) do better on methadone than subs?

Now that i have the option mear me, Im leaning towards switching both for price and efficacy",1527205021.0

Or is it just me?,"I fell in love with opiates since extracting opium from poppies I grew a while back, I joined this sub thinking it may be a place to share knowledge and experiences. But I came and it seems everyone is hooked. 

Personally I found opium and other opiates to help me learn how to feel uninhibited pleasure outside of taking anything. I learnt a lot from opiates. And when I see people struggle it hurts.

I asked myself how people could get so hopelessly addicted to these things and why I had not fallen into it after using on and off for a while and only really experiencing positives. Outside of withdrawal.. which I don’t allow my use to ever get to..

Then i realized most addicts don’t take psychedelic drugs.

I used mushrooms on occasion as a reset. Whenever I fall into any addictive behaviour I take a large dose of mushrooms and get healed. Sounds silly. But going into psychedelic experiences with true intent can be a life saver. I am addiction free. I take mushrooms a couple times a year. And I rarely use opiates. Now and then I take Kratom. Rarely ever two days in a row.

I’m not trying to sound conceited, but I just want to offer this piece of advice to others. If you are an addict. Take mushrooms. At least 4-5grams

It’s helped me with my addictive behavior and I’m sure it could help many of you. Opiates are incredible. But nothing compared to being free of cravings",1527196531.0

If it’s just fent and not heroin too, can I hope If my mom quick cups me, nothing will show? (I describe the stuff in post)","Last night my mom said she’s gonna start randomly drug testing me, (long story) I have a feeling she’ll come home from work today with a quick cup, and if I fail things are about to go real bad for me. I’m hoping that what I’ve been using might just be fent and not show up on whatever test she uses... **it’s pure white powder and is completely clear like water in the needle. It gets a little foggy when stirring it and some clear grains(?) fall to the bottom of the spoon that make crushing feeling/sound when I press down on them.**   


The high wears off quickly but has almost like a stimulant reaction on me, I get distracted reading things on my phone and type long texts, and I’m able to get tasks done that I normally can’t get myself out of bed to do. **It’s extremely easy to do too much, or too little, it’s really hard to find the amount in between, it’s a fine line between barely any rush at all and waking up confused some time later with the needle nearby.** I know how dangerous it is to guess amounts, and I plan to get back on suboxone soon because I can’t seem to stay clean without it.        



**So I’m hoping what I’ve been using is just fentanyl and whatever she tests me with won’t show it, does it sound like that’s a possibility? Or is it likely there’s heroin in this stuff too?**    



If it’s likely there’s more than just fent, I’ve even worried there could be some sort of stimulant in it from how I act throughout the day, but It’s obvious an opiate since I’ve ‘gone out’ on it a few times but luckily just woken up each time it happened. But for now im just trying to worry about whether there’s heroin in it or not, I’m used to it probably being a mix but this stuff is different, what is your guess?   



**So: what are the chances it’s just been fentanyl and I pee in the cup and pass without trying to beat it?? Or should I try to beat the test, but my options are limited, I have no one to find to get clean pee, and no time to order anything online. Can quick cups be beat by pouring something else in them like water or juice/soda??**   


*My anxiety is through the roof right now.*    



**edit**: I just realized I have a first check drug test I could be experimenting with but I’m so scared of finding out I’m screwed. Would I test it by just seeing if I piss dirty, or use it to see if pouring tap water in my pee would work, or anything of the sort. I even thought of getting my little brother’s pee from the toilet, since he usually doesn’t flush, but it would be very diluted, and he’d have to pee sometime soon, should I get his toilet pee if I have the chance?

Went where the junkies hang out, offered a dude a few bucks to take me to his guy. It's not too hard to tell who the dealers are, but I figure the dealers are going to be a little more comfortable selling if I'm with some locals than if some strange white boy walks up and asks to buy drugs.

Dude is stoked to make a few bucks and obviously is gonna hustle a couple bags as the middle man. Whatever, cost of doing business, as long as I save some time and I'm not wandering aimlessly around the block when the neighborhood is crawling with police.

Another dude chases us down and starts bitching about the fact that the first guy is taking me to a different dealer. Starts putting his hands on me and trying to pull me one way. A third guy sees the incident and starts pulling me another way, trying to sell me crack which I don't want.

I decide to keep following the dude I threw a few bucks. The black dude with the crack wanders off, the bearded Latino dude follows me and the junkie I asked to help me out in the first place and harasses him, telling the dude he owes him and acting all hurt he was taking me to buy off someone else.

At this point, the Latino dude has been keeping his hands on me. I got bad vibes from him but I trust the other junkie to at least take me to get decent dope even though he's gonna try and lie about prices so he can score a couple bags for himself on my dime.

Some other dude on the street walked up next to me, shook his head, and whispered ""walk with me"" and started trying to make like we knew each other. This confirmed my bad vibes about the Latino dude that was insistent on coming with us. He threatened to fuck the good Samaritan up, and we kept walking. I decided that in terms of strength, not to mention possible weapons, trying to ditch the dude with his hands on me would be more likely to result in personal injury and legal trouble than if i kept walking.

My faith in the junkie I asked to introduce me to his guy was well placed enough. I got what I needed, it was the strongest I've ever had, and the price would have been alright if he hadn't tried to give me half of what I paid for because I looked suburban. No big deal there, I got a number and a few corners I can try without arousing too much suspicion.

Sketchy Latino dude tells me the middle man gave him some stamps to pay him back for something, then he hands them to me and demands that I pay him for the stamps... which were originally purchased with my money. I tell him I have no cash left on me and tell him to go settle his dispute with the middle man himself. He gets bent out of shape, starts demanding $20, and then throws a brick at the guy from earlier who was trying to get me away. He insists we go to an atm and I figure I'd rather just pull $20 out of an ATM than deal with this crackhead in a neighborhood I don't know.

Needless to say, we hit the ATM, he reaches over and types in $200 on the ATM while I'm trying to pull out money, grabs my money and my card out of the machine, and tells me he's gonna hook me up with some bundles since the other guy skimmed a few bags off of me. We're I not holding at the time, I would have started swinging at the guy when he reached over and punched in a different number while I tried to take out money, but at this point I'm now holding and from out of town, so a brawl that doesn't end with a quick knockout is going to end with me going to jail when the locals back his story over mine.

Where it gets fucking bizarre, is that he spent the next two hours wandering around knocking on doors, making calls, and insisting he would get me more dope while holding onto my atm card. My dumb ass, reluctant to let my atm card walk, followed him around while he tried to pull out more money, not realizing the card was locked out for suspicious activity. He bought me dinner, kept promising his guy would meet us in ten minutes, and I got a couple other phone numbers and samples from dudes that told me this guy was a dickhead.

I figured that humoring the dude was the smartest call because he couldn't pull any more money out and if I hung around long enough I'd at least get the card back, and he had already exhibited violent tendencies anyway. As far as I was concerned, anything I could have done to set him off would draw attention from LEO and put me at risk.

In either case, I'm out $200 and I don't think the bank will reimburse it even though the withdrawals were under implied duress and he memorized the pin code and made the actual withdrawal.

I cannot for the life of me figure out why he would waste so much time acting like he was trying to get me a couple bundles, buy me a meal, and then hand my card back to me if he was just trying to rob me. There's a part of me that's quietly distraught that he might have actually been the world's shittiest dope dealer and that I might have gotten so fed up with the bullshit that I just left him with my money moments before the drugs arrived because his friend texted me that ""he's got your stuff"" shortly after I left.

Should I just block the number and hope I never see the dude again? Return with a couple friends and a tire iron? Feel the situation out? Report the card stolen?

And did I do the right thing by not causing a scene while I was holding? I feel like a pushover for letting him grab my money and for hanging around as if he would actually deliver... but the alternatives seemed excessively risky.

Anyway folks, hopefully my misfortune was of some amusement to you. I just finished off the last remnants of what I picked up that night so I wouldn't figure that the narrative is super clear. In either case, I hate being away from home, shit is so easy where I live. The different organizations have their different corners, no one yells to try and get your attention or steal your business from a competitor, buying drugs is a fucking simple, civilized, quiet process.",1527111595.0

been on and off this hamster wheel for a good decade now. nothing new in my story. wisdom teeth > hydros > medicine cabinets > oxycontin > heroin > iv heroin. rehabs a handful of times, i string together a year or two, and slowly fall back into the cycle. got out of rehab last year, stayed clean for another year, then push came to shove started dabbling again. i’ve been “chipping” but i’m far enough down this road i know that lifestyle is a mirage. 

currently on day 4 clean from a week bender - had a work trip to chicago and blindly searched for some areas to cold cop (love a good cold cop, especially in notoriously shitty areas with good tan) and rode that sack out through sunday morning. didn’t even plan on it - just that wandering boredom that turned into fueling some excitement when i landed. sometimes being a dope fiend feels like being a tourist just in a sick, twisted way. going to sw chicago felt like a normal tourist visiting the louvre 😂. i know some of you degenerates know this feeling. anyways, rambling.

reason i decided to post was because i realized i take a lot from here and give nothing. i’m one of those that comes here only when i’m withdrawaling or out. when i see the other posts about where people are at in their withdrawal or how frustrating this hamster wheel can get, it makes me feel better 🤷🏼‍♂️ - misery sure does love company. dori posted she was 48 hours in when i was ending my day one, and it gave me a benchmark - it gave me the realization that someone else is doing this too, which is why i decided to post. if this kind of thing helps anyone - leave a comment or PM. just talking or bullshitting feels to help me out when i’m in that acute phase or PAWS is setting in. someone posted about suicidal ideation from withdrawling and i’ve never gotten SI but the apathy and depression have been crippling in lately w/d’s.

In the movie it’s never elaborated on, and most people I’ve seen talking about it seem to think it’s a form of Dilaudid (hydromorphone), since that’s what they end up with a ton of in the movie. 

But I finally got around to reading the book, and I’m to the part after their first pharmacy robbery:
 

““How much do you want, babe?”

Diane hemmed and hawed and finally said, “Oh, I don’t know, give me a blue and a couple of sixteenths.”

Bob frowned. “You think you can handle all that?”

“You damn right.”

He handed her a ten milligram Numorphan tablet. It was blue and about the size and consistency of an aspirin… …Taken along with two sixteenths of Dilaudid in the form of two very small white pills, this dose would undoubtedly kill anyone but a confirmed addict. “

I have this massive natural tolerance so codeine never did much for me. Hydrocodone got me high, like a real opiate high, for the first time when I took like 50-70 mgs. After that, that was my DOC. I’d dose anywhere from 70-100 mgs with promethazine/diphenhydramine no problem. The supply of that ran out. It was never steady to begin with. Then my cousin who shot Dilaudid introduced it to me and I started snorting that. Did that for a couple months. I’d say about 6 months to a year or so. Dropped that habit for about 4 months then hopping right back in with 82.5 mgs of hydrocodone. That led me to picking up the dilaudid habit again. I shortly afterwards started IM the dilaudid to get a better bioavailability. I did that for 6 months or so then I was desperate one night and IVed 4 mgs and was surprised that it pinned my pupils. Payday came shortly afterwards and then I IVed the whole 8mg pill and that was it. The rush with the pins and needles felt amazing. Now I’m 6 months down the line with that and all I do is IV now.

Sorry for the rambling, just thought id thank you. now onto my question...

So ive been smoking for idk, like a month or two now. I dont smoke (tar) everyday usually about every 2 days sometimes ,multiple days off sometimes multiple days on, visa versa whenever i feel like gettin high af and playing some fortnite with my homies, and of course trying to avoid getting any wd symptoms....... NOW due to this i have no tolerance but i still find it hard to get the desired high i want from my tar...  here are some questions im sure you geniuses would love to answer for me. Thanks and happy noddin

1. How much should I put on my foil when i smoke, i usually put .01 to .1 at mosttttt, now should i be putting more onto the foil and is that why I'm not getting super high?

2. Now my tar neverrr rolls. It never leaves a trail it just turns to ash
 ((( I have decent tar most of my sacs I THINK    
  i usually get anywhere from .2 to 1g depending on how long i want it to last AND the quality differs mildy,)))  
 but is this because off the quality of my tar?? Or could it pretain to my previous question and just be solved by putting more

3. I also usually smoke some h... wait a minute and smoke some weed. Then before i go to bed like an hour to 2 later i smoke h again. Is this a good strategy or am i literaly just blowin threw my stash to not feel any more euphoria by redosing. 

Number 1 and 2 are my main concern as i feel like i am wasting lots and lotsss of money, if you dont want to read that whole essay in simple terms.... HOW MUCH H DO I PUT ON THE FOIL AND HOW COME MY H DONT DO NO GODAMN TRAILS",1527048082.0

I have been doing codeine for 9 months straight once a week already \(and still not addicted, no withdrawals or anything if i skip a dose. Must be lucky or something\)

Anywho, i was looking for a way to potentiate the codeine i have. Tried looking up for some gluthimide substitutes and if they're available, but to no avail. Next best thing that won't kill ya is dexamethasone, so i made up a bullshit story for the pharmacists about an asthma emergency and bought 10x 0,5mg strip for about 2 euros, extracted my dose of codeine and was prepared for a trip, but lost a strip of antihistamines i had, but since i've been doing this for quite a while the histamine reaction didn't really affect me all that much anymore except for the regular itch here and there, so thought i could take it. Boy was i about to have a really unpleasant experience:

1st attempt

6:00am \- drank 3 dexamethasone tablets

7:30am \- drank 2 dexamethasone tablets

the only reason i've did this is that i read sketchty reports that dexamethasone can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to work, so i thought i'll space it out to get the enzymes working the most they can.

8:00am \- drank codeine with some sodium carbonate water \(to remove acids from stomach, so more gets to the digestive tract\)

8:10am \- feeling the opiate come up, damn, doesn't usually start this fast.

8:30am \- the histamine reaction came in

9:00am \- by now this was the worst histamine reaction i've experienced ever, period, it felt like i was walking on needles. My entire ARM was bloated, the itching was unbearable.

9:10am \- found a clemestine tablet, drank it. Thank God.

the itching subsidied after half an hour, and the high kinda remained. I couldn't really appreciate it a lot due to the itching and me disregarding anthisitamines, but you could say that the unusual histamine reaction i had was a tip off that it worked.

The opiate hight lasted somewhere until 11:00am, then i took a few gabapentin capsules and nodded the rest of my day, going about my usual business/band practices and socializing. Was a wonderful day overall.

2nd attempt

Took 5 days off for my tolerance to reset to see if i had the same results, this time lowering dexamethasone intake for control

11:00pm \- took 1 dexamethasone tablets

12:00pm \- took another one, same as above

12:30pm \-  took codeine with some antacids, and took 1 cetirizine tablet with it

12:45pm \- again, codeine kicks in WAY faster than before. Holy shit the rush is amazing

13:00pm \- went on a date, bought some extra codeine while high on codeine for the future, heh

15:00pm \- high ended, took some gabbies to enhance the afterglow and went on my day socializing as usual \(that's usually the only reason i take oppies tbh\)

I took a much lesses dose this time, the rush was really simmilar, but the high didn't last as long as the first one. Can't tell if it was due to the dexamethasone or my natural bodies phenomenon \(you know, with the codeine being a prodrug and all\)

Verdict: Dexamethasone did potentiate my codeine, for what it's worth. Tt gave a much stronger rush and extended it's action by a bit, quite noticeably than the last time i did codeine without it. If i had to give it an estimae on how much it improved the trip overall it would be somewhere around 15\-20&#37; but now i need another control group after this experience. Can't say that it did miracles, though. If you're really in a pinch and need to make the best out of the opiate supply you've got then have no doubt \- dexamethasone does work. But if you have a choice and getting opiates is less of a problem/not that expensive \( a 300mg pack of codeine costs 2,30 euros for me\) then i would just recommend getting more opiates, since opiates don't really have a ceilling dose, contrary to popular belief. \+ dexamethasone might be able to cause nasty side effects if taken long term, since it's an immunosupressant, so i wouldn't recommend it as a long term solution.

Regardless of the outcome, i will get back to ya'll on this quite soon, since i'm gonna try codeine without the dexamethasone after a break to see if i still get the same rush \(can't rule out the possibility of a strong placebo, brain does work wonders when ya biased\)",1527024457.0

First things first, I'm a 26 y/o male residing in canada. The only time i had ever taken opiates in my life is when I crashed my motorcycle at 20 y/o, the hospital i was transported to gave me 5 percocets for the pain for the next few days \(5/325\). Never went out of my way to find more but when buddies had some percs i would take them occasionally.   


 Fast forward about two years later, I tore my knee apart. Grade 3 MCL tear, ACL tear and Meniscus tear. Docs gave me tramadol for the pain when it first happened but they made me feel sick and didn't really help the pain. They gave me a script for 30 more percocets until i could get into surgery. Had the surgery and was sent home with 50 more percocets. I was in so much pain i had to take 2\-3 every 4 hours just to be able to tolerate it. I would even wake up in the middle of the night in so much pain so i would reach for the bottle and take another 2\-3 and go back to sleep.   


Pain started to subside after around a month and i was walking better but still hurt as they said it would take a few months for the pain to fully go away. It never went away and now i am looking at early onset arthritis in my knee which isn't uncommon for these types of surgeries and knee injuries. I then was given a monthly prescription for the same percocets. 60/month and was instructed to use them only when i needed them. \(we all know how this goes\)  


Well i didn't use them when I only needed them for pain, i started using them all the time taking up to 10 \-12 per day. They didn't last long. I had to get blood work done and my tests came back i had a high liver enzyme which was due to my excessive drinking and painkillers. Stopped drinking completely but still lied and complained to my doc that my knee still hurt \( it still did hurt but not nearly as much as i was telling him\) He then put me on more oxycodone 10Mg without the acetaminophen in hope to help my liver. This is where it started to get worse and worse.    


Since there was no APAP in these ones, i started to sniff them. Sniffing one, swallowing one. Multiple times a day. Doc filled up my script twice and when i went back to Go see my doctor for the third time he had had retired i guess or moved but the receptionist didn't care to elaborate. The new doc \(younger female dr that looked like she just got out of med school\) will not prescribe me anymore and was frankly surprised and angry that i have been taking so many and my previous doctor would even allow me to get that many. \(here in canada it seems like they are way more stingy to prescribe oxy now after all of the abuse.\) They even switched most of the oxy to Oxyneo to help battle the abuse here. Cant get them prescribed so turn to the streets, found some 20mg oxys from a plug and he had upwards of 300 of them. I must have bought at least 150 of them to last me a while and now they have finally ran out . He can't get more of them and i do not trust anyone else because of the recent fent pills going around in my city.    


Im going to attempt to stop doing them all together, After being on them for more than 14 months and usually averaging 60\-80mg a day I'm concerned with how my W/D are going to be. Ive never battled withdrawals from opiates because I've been on them daily for a year straight. I have battled withdrawals from alcohol when i was drinking a litre or more of vodka a day for around 8 months and those were absolutely horrible, it felt like i would feel better if i was dead than having to deal with them.  


I am legitimately scared on how these W/D are going to be, I'm scared I'm going to relapse and buy tainted pills or something because of the feeling of being unwell.

That's what I would be saying if I was still doing stupid things. Last week I got paid, had to pay one $80ish debt and then had the rest of my money left for bike parts and incidentals. Cliff was hoping and expecting me to get subs but I didn't put any effort in or even share any of my own this time. He was given the option to fund subs for himself a number of times prior but he kept postponing and decided to spend his money on other things. If I share any subs with him or loan him any with my own money, I'm basically sending the message that it's okay to have no foresight and rewarding such behavior. Furthermore, he certainly wouldn't pay me back with subs or cash. If I'm attempting to follow my own recovery program, trading my personal supply of subs for roxies is probably not a good idea. It's not conducive to recovery.

Cliff is looking forward to script day, and will likely get someone else to pick up the script in order to be able to get someone with a car to pick up multiple bottles of soda among other necessities. I've made it pretty clear I'm not interested, that I don't want to get in on that script.

He'll want to graciously give me two free pills and knowing that I can't just have two will offer to lend me more until pay day. He already did. He has to go to the doctor on Wednesday and pick up the script on Saturday. If I do get in on this, I'll reset my suboxone taper just because of one day of partying and by partying I mean doin pills that aren't even as good as dope. If I'm gonna do something ""bad"", I might as well do it right. Then of course I would be indebting myself the following week. If I owe Cliff $100, he'll surely ask to borrow a little more. Why even bother putting myself in that position?

Last time I got pills, it sucked. I ate a couple, snorted a bunch and tried to finish all of them before too late and just got sick from it. Not terribly sick just nauseous and ughish. I do so love not being entangled in the various games that come with the territory. I wouldn't have a solid taper schedule or supply of subs if I didn't stop going along with all of the bullshit games and listenign to my instincts. I couild have shared subs with Cliff numerous times since last week but it's not like he cared to get them when he had the money.

So this coming week, he'll hope to get me on board to take on some 15mg roxies on loan but I don't see the value comapred to continuing my suboxone taper plan and getting as low as possible. It would be harder to say no if he was offering to loan me dope but the repercussions would be similar. We'll see how it pans out. I'm curous to hear what Cliff says to entice me to get on board. Surely, whatever he thinks I want to hear. Any time I appear serious about clocking out of the game and being running partners with Cliff, he ups his offers. Like that time where he offered me a half a bun to bike to the ATM with his card instead of the normal .2 of a bun he offered prior.

So I can go on, get loaned some pills this Saturday and put myself behind by $100 before pay day. Alternatively, I can keep taking my subs, get below 2mg.. keep it going. Of course as far as Cliff is concerned I have nothing. No dope, pills or subs. If he asks how I'm doing so well, I'll just tell him I took a fist full of DXM \(which I do have stocked up\) even though I'm still on subs. If he thinks I have none, he can't ask me or beg me for any in his time of need.

I am carefully rationing my supply. I have a couple of those old people pill cases with compartments for the days of the week and I found my late mother's pill cutter which allows me to get clean and fairly precise cuts of Suboxone pills down to 1/8 size. The compartmental case allows me to physically plot my daily dosage, sort of like a physical representation of a spreadsheet. To top things off, I got my hands on two fresh 8mg strips from another friend for some weed. 

So I'm looking forward to following through and facing what comes my way. I don't think I'll get paid enough to be able to waste it on dope so I'm trying to avoid considering that option for next week's pay day. I bought some nitric oxide to back me up in order to prcent symptoms of ""stage fright"" for when I attract women in the comming weeks. That's for another post, and I've already wrote part of it but I'm finalizing the science, research and empirical results for said post.

You know, there have just been times where I get invited to a bar to see some friends and decline because I don't have money left over after buying dope. I'm just really happy though, that I am not scraping along. If I didn't have subs, I'd be seeking a variety of means to get some relief and would have no money to do it. That's why I stocked up on subs and DXM. I still haven't used DXM for anything but a cold but the theory of use makes sense. 

Shit, I still have to fix up a power cord for Cliff's Macbook before script day. If I don't he'll remind me and say ""paid for this computer in full"", yes for once he paid for something. Of course his carelessness is overlooked. When I loaned him a second spare power cord \(one in shit condition because I wasn't going to let him ruin a good one\) I told him he needed to take good care of it and he assured me he would. That he doesn't throw the computer at the floor or do anything to damage or wear out the power cord. Then there was that last time he was barred out and I literally saw him toss the plugged\-in Macbook onto the floor. Point is, many people will promise and claim they take care of shit when they obviously don't. I'm taking my time fixing the power cord because I want it to sink in that it's his fault, not mine and that if he doesn't take care of his shit that next time he'll have to wait an eternity to get it fixed.

It's like when someone spills soda on a laptop, then it works for two days and when it stops two days later you blame the soda but the user is like ""but it worked after I spilled soda on it."" :::face palm::: .... \(corrosion, and science\) Beyond that, Cliff's house is a pile of garbage, not conducive to taking good care of shit. Well maybe ""shit"", because there's plenty of places for his dog to shit. There's brown spots all over his floor where dog shit was picked up, there are other areas where he advises, ""watch your step"" and the electricity is still turned off. Cable TV is back on but power has been out for over two weeks. His house smells more like raw garbage as the humidity rises and I wouldn't even want to open his refrigerator. 

Then there's the bed bugs, if I keep doing dope and keep hanging out with Cliff frequently, I'll just get bed bugs in my house again. I already had thwarted a close call last year and I don't want to repeat that shit. I got very lucky and acted fast. Now, every time I go to Cliff's house I go through a decontamination procedure. No matter how tired I am, DECON! Luckily I haven't hung out at Cliff's in the past couple of weeks, between my business and his lack of drugs. When Cliff is dope\-sick, or has nothing to take after the worst of it is over, he just stays in his bed and watches TV. His mom likely yells at him from across the house, things like ""did money man come over yet?"" Cliff often lies about other people owing him money to be delivered to appease his mom and then pushes the goal post up when she remembers. 

Shit, I don't remember what I wanted to share with you readers... I guess I just wanted to check in and say that I'll put a little more effort into following my recovery action plan than I have in the past. Partially due to financial constraints, but also because summer is approaching. All winter I told myself that's it's too cold to quit all opioids, that I'll do it in the spring. There may be anxiety and hyper\-algesia for some but the hardest thing aside from anxiety is the bite of the cold. Take the cold out of the equation, I can manage the rest with a good solid biking regiment. 

Hence the reason I must keep my costs down, so I can finish replacing worn components on my bike and upgrade it a bit. With said parts, I safely can do a thousand miles before the end of August. With every 10\-20 mile day of cycling, natural endorphins will  be produced. Hopefully I can repair the mis\-wiring of my brain and get back on track with other productive activities that make me happy.

I am a long term opiate addict. I am writing this to maybe help someone or inform them about my experience with the OTC drug loperamide. Loperamide is contained in Imodium, it is readily available. Three years ago I found myself in a bad situation facing impending withdrawal due to my source being cut off. Loperamide is an opiate that use to be scheduled and prescribed. Many think it just works in the GI tract and at low therapeutic doses it does just that. However when a large dose (30-60mg depending) is taken it will cross the blood brain barrier causing it to permeate and become centrally acting. It will take every withdrawal symptom away. I thought it was miraculous that I could spend eight bucks for 200 and my opiate addiction was satiated. I continued to take loperamide for the past 3 years, never wanting to get high or take any other opiate. I found my use slowly escalating from 60mg to at its peak 190mg(80 pills). I started taking Xanax to lower my tolerance and ended up getting physically dependent on the benzo and my use escalated to an awful 20mg a day habit. I was able to cut down the lope to 70mg. A few months ago I began shooting H to transition from the long acting lope(which I only had to dose once a day, at the beginning only every other day). I was not able to fully become dependent on the H due to a situation that forced me to come clean about my use. I had tapered the Xanax down to 8mg a day. I ended up going to treatment. I was very precise and clear about the lope, which they had never treated. I spent 7 days in a detox unit being given phenobarbital(for the Xanax withdrawal) and suboxone for the opiate/lope withdrawal. I do not wish this on my worst enemy as it was pain and insanity simultaneously. I am writing this to warn people about long term lope use. It is been over 40 days since I checked in and am out. I have to take propanalol for my heart rate which is 145 when I wake up. I am still sweaty, depressed, GI issues, restlessness. It is akin to methadone withdrawal. I have wanted to get on suboxone but know it will prolong this dependency and I will eventually have to come off it. The neurotoxicity of lope has not been studied. My cognitive abilities are coming back but I fear for any permanent damage. Please stay away from loperamide as it is much harder than any opiate withdrawal I have been through. If you must use it to get out of withdrawal just use it sparingly. It will become a daily habit soon due to the availability and cost. Save yourself from the experiment I conducted on myself.

I mean I’ll go hard for a long run and then decide my life is in the shitter and fix it up, go a while, and then back again. My last run was the worst when I was spending $2000/day to simply stay well at approximately this time last year and I was in the lowest point I’d ever gotten myself into. Fortunately my family stood by despite all the using, lying, thieving, etcetera, and my wife had my back, but despite all that it’s amazing how quickly it all comes back and the lying could be so easy to start again... even after all the positive shit I’ve done since. I don’t think them demons ever leave your brain. I went to rehab for three months last year, have spent over $150,000 getting clean in total, changed my number, felt ready for anything. Even ropi doesn’t trigger me. But in my inbox my guy (as I met him on reddit in the good old sub long gone now) has sent me several messages recently, saying “the boss” was asking about the regular (aka the scary dudes in the trap with automatic rifles that I met a few times when with him during reup) and I find myself having to suddenly work harder than a mutherfucker to fight those demons whispering heroin in the back of my head.

I have detoxed at home 10\+ times from the opes but have never made it through a benzo withdrawal \(HELL\) without cracking....

I need to detox under medical supervision because I am seizure prone so it is very high risk for me to come off of benzos.. \(my doctor said it would literally kill me a lot easier than most people\)

I would like to rapid taper the opiates first then the benzos....

I have tapered both my benzo and opiate doses down below a 1/3 \(and switched from tar to kratom btw\) of what I was taking in January and I am dead set on getting clean!! I have been using both for more than 4 years btw and had other concurrent addictions that I have dropped a long the way... These are the last 2 habbits to drop, due to never being able to make it through how hellacious benzo withdrawals are...

I dont want to return to using drugs at all I really want to get clean!! I got rid of all friends who do drugs in my life and will be only placing myself in healthy environments in the future.

Ok I have a lot of questions:

How can I make the most out of this experience and set myself up for success??

Where the staff nice to you and helpful??

I want to be essentially anesthetized and unaware for the whole experience is it okay to tell the staff this???

Any tips going in?

I know what works well for myself in withdrawal \(baclofen, GHB, lyrica, marinal, ketamine, and soma\) can I give the this list or will they even listen to me?

Should I bring my own pills in I am scared they will screw me and just give me clonodine or some shit, if they don't help me enough I know myself, I will discharge myself, walk out and will have wasted my entire savings on a detox that: felt crappy, didn't even work, and be back to square 1 still addicted....

I don’t think it was near the severity of a medical emergency, as I was still able to squeeze out some turds around it, but I’m 100% sure of the diagnosis. Basically I could feel it in my colon for a week and a half, but couldn’t squeeze it out. 

I tried everything.  Miralax. Stool softeners. Suppository. Castor oil (I still gag thinking about that). Putting lube up my ass. Trying to reach a finger in there to break it up. NOTHING worked. It was starting to affect my quality of life. I was miserable. 

I was about to go to the doctor. Basically I had resigned myself to the fact that a medical professional was going to have to spelunk my asshole to break it down and get it out. The thought was terrifying. 

After countless hours of googling, I came across a recommendation for something called Oxy Powder. 

Sorry fellow junkies, despite the word “oxy” in the name, it’s in no way related to a narcotic. 

I read that it breaks down hard and impacted stools, to serve its main function of cleaning out the digestive system. 

I figured what the hell, it can’t hurt. I’ll try anything at this point. I ordered a bottle of 20 on Amazon, and paid the extra $5 for next day shipping. 

I ate 4 capsules last night, per the directions, along with a lot of water. 

I woke up this morning pessimistic, as I wasn’t feeling the urge to dump that the product description led me to believe I would be feeling. 

I lazily got a cup of coffee. Sat down. Wanted to cry, I was so uncomfortable. 

5 minutes later, the urge hit. I walked to the bathroom, saying a prayer to a God I’m not sure I believe in anymore. 

I sat down. And the magic happened. That rock hard turd slid out like toothpaste being squeezed out of the tube. It was still very hard and compact, but something was different. It actually moved. 

At first, I thought it was too good to be true. It must have been another load that once again made its way around the impaction. The only way to tell was to bear down, and squeeze those muscles together. 

I squeezed. I felt nothing. The large mass that was so uncomfortable, for so long, was no longer there. 

I cried. I shit you not. Legit cried. Tears of happiness. 

If you feel like you can’t clear that shit out, try OxyPowder. I won’t guarantee you that it will work. But I think it’s worth $10 to give it a shot. 

No, I do not work for them or endorse them in any official capacity. I’m just a junkie who couldn’t shit right. And OxyPowder saved my ass. Literally. ",1526996933.0

I'ma 28 year old male and have been doing opiates for about 11 years and recently started dabbling with fent presses. 
I have never been clean for more than 3 weeks in that time. 
It was never everyday for extended amounts of time because of money problems. I'm more of a binge addict because I have no problem taking 30 Roxie's In 3 days, bumping small amounts of fent and drinking and doing benzos. 
After that I may go a week til pay day with only weed and alcohol so I don't really know how physically addicted I am because the withdrawals aren't too bad, as long as there are a bunch of other substances.  No where near as bad as opanas or the months of poppy seed tea but that was years ago
 But I'm 100% mentally addicted.
To make things worse in November I broke my arm because I was skateboarding to the corner store on Klonopin and 32oz king kobra malt liquor and I was going to get more like an idiot half blacked out and I broke my elbow and coller bone 
since I don't have insurance I went to the Dr once after the er visit and the recommend a cast but because of insurance and money issues I left with an arm brace and and sixty 5 mg oxycodones and four 2 mg Dilaudid. I was never albe to go back to the Dr and now of course 6 months later I'm still in pain alot of daily pain and my elbow is messed up pretty bad and a friend's dad who was a foot Dr so not exactly his specialty but he said he would recommend it be rebroke and reset. 
Now adding being legitimately in pain daily and ruined my opiates usuage. I've started knowing buying fent pressed blue oxys because normal oxy does help and they are everywhere but of course because of money I don't do them daily.
I really want to some how get of some sort of replacement med. But I don't know if I have to go to the Dr after I use? Or can I go the week or 10-15 days I'm clean from opiates? 
Ive learned I'm powerless trying to quit with my own with kratom or gabapentin or pst or benzos and alcohol or anything and now that I have legitimate pain I have to take something to deal with the pain and i don't want to do fent pressed anymore  or opiate binges or my fingers going numb all the time and not being able to make a tight fist with alot of pain in my elbow. 
Do I have to be withdrawing to try and get these meds? I've taken subutex recently and I was able to make a whole one last 4 days and was never high and i was in zero pain and had zero urge to redose or even get high. I have taken 2 full ones before and got extremely high do I understand it can do that but that not what I want anymore. 
How should I go about getting something that will help me and I don't know if subutex or suboxe or methadone or what would be great or any at all. I just know the behavior I've been doing for 10 years plus needs to end but I can't deal with the pain sober. I'm not sure what or how to do anything.

Crashed my car while on 3 bars that I accidentally ate (started with one, then took 2 while almost blacked out),  Im stupid I know. Didnt get a dui thankfully. Please never drive blacked out, its dangerous as fuck.

 I got 5250d which is a 14 day hold. Stayed in a shitty looney bin for 6 days. All while bein givin 3 10 mg k56 every 4 hours. The MD’s at the looney bin were surprisingly script happy idk why. They even offered me morphine but I was aiming for getting 30s you feel me? It ended up being just the 3 10s but boy it would keep me happy :).6 days later I got transferred to a pretty sweet half “rehab “ half psych house. The group sessions were boring but the spot was dope. Vig ass tv perfect for watchin the warriors jn the playoffs. 

Anyway, I cracked some ribs and broke my collarbone so Ive been givin like over 200 oxy over this time period. I know this because the psych md at the house pulled the ultimate homie move and moved me up to 40 mg every 4 hours or some shit! But the pharmacist at Kaiser denied it and that is how I know Ifound out from him that im the 200+ range...

I stayed in that house for a cool minute, sitting through group and personal therapy sessions about being sober and controlling your actions, all the while high on Oxy through all of it because of my dumbass injury lol,

I just got back out to the real world today and I got a job lined up and an appointment with my pcp. She said I wont be able to see pain management for a couple weeks atleast, and the appointment is going to be them 2 with me, which leads me to my question..

What is pain management like? I did a terribly fast google search and pee tests and pill counts came up. Anybody here with some advice on what I should do to make sure I get some good shit while telling them Im trying to ween off in like a month or so (i might need surgery idk yet). Should I just keep my mouth shut? Please share your experiences

That was hella long. Thanks for bearin with me. Pardon me for spilling my guys im just on zan plus some gaba and a couple percs . They dishcharged me today with 21 percs.

8l87ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8l87ef/addiction_is_it_really_a_disease/,53,https://redd.it/8l87ef,PassiveTactics,"Addiction, is it REALLY a disease?","I'd like to hear everyone's opinions in regards to this question. But first, I'll give my own.(note that this is only my opinion and by no means is meant to undermine anyone else's, it's simply meant to start a conversation). 
The DSM-5, which I believe is the most up to date diagnostic representation of psychological disorders states that addiction is indeed a disease(I may be wrong here, this was just what we used when I was in college). I haven't poured through the data myself, but nonetheless, it's in there. Here's my problem, stating that addiction is a disease gives us another reason to justify our using of our DOC. It's true that those with an addiction DO have mental and physical processes that exacerbate the using of drugs (anxiety, depression, pain, fear), to name a few. Also, there are brain scans that show that addicts do have different patterns than those of non-users. Yet, as far as I know, and based off of all the research I've done, there aren't any studies that show that those particular patterns exist PRIOR to the addiction taking place.  Of course, anxiety and depression can be the reason someone might turn to drugs, but isn't that the disease? Yes, we know that there are certain genes that can be inherited that make one more likely to become an alcoholic for example, this has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. BUT, these recessive genes aren't expressed unless they are turned on. Can't the argument be made that these expressions are simply a result of environment? For example, if a person had the alcoholic gene, if that person lived in a place where alcohol was never available, they wouldn't ever become an alcoholic. As an ex-addict(opiates), it always bugged me when the therapist would say ""firstly, let me tell you that what you have is a disease"". It seems like a cop out, like a way to tell yourself and others that what happened to you wasn't your fault. I never wished to become and addict, growing up I never even considered becoming an addict was a possibility, yet, like so many others, it happened. But it's not like one day I just woke up and needed to go get some heroin, it was a long process. Maybe it's more that some of us just have that little switch in our brain that makes it more difficult to quit things, an addictive personality as some might call it. But having an addictive personality doesn't directly result in addiction, again, i feel it's a result of the environment we live in. A disease can be something we're born with, a disease can be something that one day we wake up with. Indeed, environmental factors CAN cause diseases(one can be more hereditarily prone to skin cancer for example, yet if they don't go in the sun too often it won't ever happen).  Although I'm ashamed of it, I believe that my addiction was entirely my fault. I wasn't in a bad place at the time, in fact, I was at one of the highest points of my life. I had just finished college, I had a great job and was making tons of money. Having all that money allowed me to get all the drugs I wanted, and mainly, I just enjoyed the feeling of getting fucked up. I loved LSD (any entheogens actually), ketamine, every pill I could get my hands on, alcohol, weed, actually I can't really think of a drug I didn't like and I've nearly tried them all( I know there are a shit ton of new RC's that I haven't tried, so many I don't think anyone's tried them all), but you catch my drift. I just think us addicts need to take responsibility for our actions in every single form we can, without putting the blame on anything else. Whether addiction is a disease or not, and it very well may be, it's our job to see why we do what we do. Telling ourselves that we have a disease simply makes it easier to tell ourselves ""I can't quit"", ""I have a disease, and it's the disease that's eating at me"", ""it's not all my fault, my grandpa was an alcoholic too"".  We already have enough excuses and justifications, ""I'm hurt and this helps"", ""I just do it for fun"", ""I'm not worth shit anyway, so why quit""?.  What do you guys/gals think? Is there any reason that we should continue to tell ourselves we have a disease, or is this just another justification? Please keep it nice everybody, I know this can be a touchy issue and I'd really love to hear everyone's opinion. If you believe it is a disease, can you elaborate a bit as to why? If not, what do you believe brought you to the point of addiction?

Idea to help those either using, stopping, PAWS, etc. Most Opiates hit the mu receptors in your brain, causing down-regulation of the density or amount of active receptor sites for these, which is responsible for withdrawal and PAWs (as most of you already know)... Well; Heat Exposure Therapy, I.E. Sauna Use (15-25 Min. Preferably) Or Hot Yoga (Even Better Cuz Exercise Too) Stimulates The Kappa Receptors In Your 'Knoggin. These are essentially your brains counter balance system to the mu side, which is why heat/kappa stimulation causes unpleasent feelings.

Now- The stimulation of kappa receptors promotes the regeneration/sensitization of the mu side, which is very helpful for tolerance, PAWS, recovery, all of the above. Just thought it'd be helpful for yall strugglin, PEACE!",1526941019.0

Never have I had so many people begging me for some sort of relief, and if they were female and didn't have money, roughly 9 out of 10 times I'd be offered sex, head, anal, whatever for a couple Roxy 30s. As a nerdy younger male, this worked great for me in my 20s, but now as I age I regret ever accepting any of the sexual favors that were given to me over time. Now i have dealt with Benzo  (Xanax) addiction personally, so I do know what it's like to withdraw and feel terrible, but I'm assuming the degree of opiate withdrawal is sadly that much higher than other drugs.

My main reason for posting was to see if any of you were former dboys or dealers that took advantage of the opiate epidemic similar to the way I did? Selling ya buddy some green and a couple of hydro 10s is one thing, but people trading me cars for entire scripts of dilaudid is very much another in which I now regret the way I acted over the years. This post isn't meant to piss anyone off. Just curious.",1526937041.0

Three months ago my GP changed practices, so Dr Suse hired two new fresh out of university student doctors so they could do their on sore training. I think mine learned a very valuable lesson. So on my first visit with her, I told her I'd like fortnightly fills becuse no matter what I do, I can just never make a whole month.. She was cool with it, handed me the magic papers, writing on them as she did... 80mg Cr night time, 40mg Cr + 20mg Cr breakfast.... You can imagine how she reacted to my request for so many pills, oh and I'd better get my 60 20mg oxynorm today to... ""Come back in 14 days and I will dispense another 28 of each of the SANDOZ generic....

This went on a few times, I don't know HOW she didn't realise, I mean she literally wrote out how many pills to take and gave me double that... 

WELL.... to begin with it was fat tastic! I even jammed a 5*80 shot in a 3ml and holy shit did it fuck me....

Anyway now for the downfall.... I had to take my disabled daughter to see a GP at same clinic, Nd I needed some rizatraptan for migraines. Anyway as soon as she saw the amount of oxy I was getting, strait to the head boss/owner....

When I went in for this fortnights app, I know I was gunna get it, first was I selling it? Nah.... OK I'm obviously using too many, why? Because my spine is fusing and I'm fucking sore, shit....

Have a got a problem with the pills? Well it's more a problem with the pain and trying to walk the line of pain relief and 'who gives a fuck about pain' - definitely not easy when you are getting 3 * 28ct boxes every 14 days...

In the end I'm assuming head Dr, Dr Suse kept me on because I've been there for ages, knows my daughter and how much I do for her... I assume he had final say overall.. 

So I got cut from SANDOZ crushable to targin instead 60mg twice daily, and 2*20mg norms per night.. I have to have weekly compliance checks and fills from same pharmacy till she trusts me again... 

I feel terrible that I abused our relationship for so long, she was almost crying last appointment, and lost it when she realised I should have another 3 months worth of oxy-nope I took it....

Have her again on we'd, gunna thank her for pulling my head in n giving me a chance to still get pain killers... Rather than cutting me adrift like so many other Drs would have... 

I'm such an asshole. It's her first work placement and I could have fucked her carer big time, lucky Dr Boss knows what's up and gave me a pass as well as her.

Or have the chemistry knowledge to say whether or not it should work, even on tar?","I find it odd that after looking often for a purification TEK, suddenly finding one that supposedly works on tar and powdered dope is easy as 1 Google Search. 

It's credited back to like 2002, and Erowid.org has notes about how if you've got fentanyl-mixed heroin, you shouldn't do this (as that cut is gone and you'll OD). 

Looks like supplies needed are:

1. Glassware
2. HcL 28% (ish?)
3. Pipettes or Eye Droppers
4. Household Ammonia
5. Ethyl Ether
6. Baking Soda


Here is the TEK, cut and pasted from Erowid:

This is as complete and as accurate as I can remember, it has been something like 9 years since I have used heroin. The process I used for purification was straight forward. Diacetylmorphine can exist in two forms, an insoluble base, or a soluble salt. Often it contained a plethera of other agents like pieces of broken glass, pieces of foil, dirt, wood, metal, mannitol, lactose, maltose, sand, you get the idea. The first stage of the process I used was to make sure the diacetylmorphine I received was totally converted to a soluble hydrochloride salt. The heroin I usually received was a brown powdered heroin, sometimes off white, very little vinegar smell. Today all you can find is a black crud that reeks with a vinegar (acetic) odor. The way I made sure it was a soluble salt was to drop enough 28% hydrochloric acid to make it wet. This insured that I would not waste any of the available drug, but would remove most if not all of the cut. I think that it would be better for me to detail it in a procedural manner. FYI, hydrochloric acid can be purchased in gallon jugs at hardware stores under the name Muriatic acid, 28%.

First weigh out one gram of heroin from the stock you received from your supplier. Place this gram into a 13 x 100mm test tube. Add a few drops of 28% hydrochloric acid until it is evenly damp. Allow to react for a minute or two. Next add 5 ml distilled water, place your thumb over the end and carefully shake to dissolve all that will dissolve into the water. Allow the insolubles to settle. Using a pipette, remove and transfer as much of the liquid to a fresh test tube leaving the solids behind. Dispose of the undissolved remains in the first test tube. Slowly add via pipette, one drop at at time, ammonium hydroxide (water clear household ammonia) until the white precipitate ceases production. Add several more drops at this point just to be sure. Shake gently to be sure that all the solution is evenly ammoniated. The solution should look milky. Now add 100 ml ethyl ether (some kinds of diesel starting fluids, read the label) to a 150 ml beaker. Dump the milky liquid into the ether and stir briskly and allow the water to settle and collect on the bottom. The water will turn clear. Using a glass pipette, remove this water from the bottom of the beaker and dispose of. 

Now mix up a solution of 5ml 28% hydrochloric acid and 5ml distilled water and add this to the ether in the beaker. Stir briskly keeping as much acid/water suspended as possible for several minutes. Allow the water/acid to collect on the bottom of the beaker. Using a glass pipette, remove this water layer from the bottom of the ether and transfer to a glass petri dish. Transfer the ether back to its storage bottle for reuse. It will still contain small amounts of heroin base, so don't throw it out. Recycle! Slowly add small portions of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to the water/acid solution in the petri until you don't notice any more bubbles being formed. Place the glass on a warm surface, and allow to evaporate. The residue will be diacetylmorphine hydrochloride and salt. Table salt is a by-product of the reaction and will not hurt you at all when injected. Scrape up the residue and weigh it. Yield from one gram of smack (yea, we called it that) would be anything from 100 to 300 mg, rarely more. Place 100 mg of this powder in a test tube, add 10 cc sterile isotonic water for injection (available OTC at drug stores) and heat to boiling. Transfer this liquid while still hot using a syringe (available OTC at some drug stores) to a 10 ml rubber stoppered empty sterile ampoule (available OTC at drug stores).

To use this drug which is 10 mg/ml, extract with a sterile syringe as much drug as you wish to use. 10 mg would send me flying believe it or not. 2.5 mg (1/4 cc) was usually enough to keep me ""happy"" and was my normal dose. 20 mg was the most I could take safely in my opinion, and was a waste of drug and money. Normally, for most 150-170 lb males, 2.5 mg is more than enough in my opinion. Using heroin in this manner avoids the problems associated with ""street use"" and will keep your body healthy and safe, reducing the risk of disease and overdosage.

My memory is pretty good, and I think I covered all the bases here, but I may have made a mistake somewhere. Overall I think this is an accurate method, to the best of my ability to remember.


Obviously ether is a watched chemical, and I have my doubts that it just works so well in what, 4 steps or so with some filtering via pipettes, but I don't know much about chemistry. 

Anybody here able to vouch for this, or use their chem know-how to confirm/deny that it should work? Does it clean up poorly synth'd stuff, and always leave you with #4 and salt? 

So many questions, and I have none of the answers. Thanks to anybody who takes the time to read this and contribute answers or info, it's tempting if it's legit.

But recently it's more that I seriously need them. I've had some things going on, to much to explain it all. Long story short I had a baby and ever since then I've been getting this excruciating pains in my stomach. I've gotten tramadol twice in the past month. My doctor won't prescribe any more because I haven't actually been diagnosed so I think she don't believe me (she's not even a Dr she's a nurse but some how my PCP) 

So today I'm going to see a gyn. Because of course they're leaning towards it being in my ovaries or something. I don't want to get to gory.

I've got Meloxicam, it made me super sick. It did take away the pain but made me dizzy and very very fatigue. I have a two year old, I can't afford to be fatigue.

Then she gave me flexiril and naproxen.
The flexiril didn't help at all. It just made me livid pissed off when I took it, even when I woke up at night to my daughter I was just highly aggitated.

A couple of days ago, I rolled on MDMA, done it about 10 times this year, though almost all of them the last 2 months however \(about every week\). Been smoking heroin daily for a month tomorrow. During that roll I did some speed and weed and that was it. After the roll, I smoked a lot of weed and heroin and when holding my breath for about 10 seconds, then going from a sitting position to standing, I'd get a weird, fucked up ""seizure"".

I got lightheaded, a head rush, then my entire body would fucking freeze/paralyze and twitch, and at that point I'd be in a delirium/catatonic\-like state, everything was blurry and couldn't focus on anything. Couldn't freely think or move. Then I'd slowly come back to my senses, with thought organizing again and me regaining control of my body. It literally felt like my brain and reality was glitching/crashing.

Afterwards, I'd feel my entire body pulsating for a couple of seconds, I'd get weird euphoric feelings and it felt like my brain did a ""restart"". It lasted only a few seconds every time, and it probably happened about 20 times or more, although it has yet to happen again since that night.

I started repeating the behavior, getting the ""seizure"" each time, because it had powerful dissociative, euphoric and ""rush"" effects, however I'm now realizing how that may be dangerous. Why did I get those ""seizures"" and could it have hurt me in any way?

There are so many anecdotal and theoretical answers on this, it's insane.

Question 1 - **does calcium carbonate or dextromethorphan (dxm) potentiate codeine?**

Question 2 - **does magnesium, calcium carbonate or anything similar potentiate OR reduce tolerance to dexamphetamine?**

Please only answer if you **know** through extensive experience the answer to these questions. **I know different people react differently, but there must be an objective, pharmacological answer to these questions.**

I feel like so many people want answers to these questions but they are literally impossible to find without every second person throwing in their two cents on why you shouldn't mix such items, why the fella with the comment above is a fool, or why you should venture to another thread.

Everyone talks about the inhibition of P450 (codeine) or CYP2D6 (amphetamines and opiates) but conclusive answers are tough as nails to find. 

**We're not here to put Socks on Centipedes everyone, let's resolve this once and for all** 

Sorry for the blunt and demanding nature of this post but I'm getting frustrated haha. 

Love you all

Do you guys think I might just be resistant to oxy (if that even is possible) or do I just have to take a bigger of a dose?
I'm also resistant to tramadol somehow; I took 400mg and didn't feel anything, is that linked to the oxy resistanse?

For example:
“I’m about to go into withdraw from x and am wondering if this will help?”
NO. “I’m about to go into withdrawal* from x”

Fyi I am not dependant on any opiate.
I’m going to write my questions and then More detail will be given about myself and the situation (IMPORTANT so please read it, will be the last paragraph).

•does tramadol cause any euphoric effects at 50mg? 

•What doses would you say are good for someone who’s new to opiates as a whole

•how many days should I leave between each dose to avoid addiction?

•is tramadol a good choice with given situation? 

I am a 19 year old Male. Suffer from pretty bad anxiety issues and that creates paranoia, also have pretty bad depression, some days I sit and break down, some i don’t. 50/50 chance every day, that’s why I want to know how many days I should leave between each use.

I first took cocodamol 30/500 codeine/paracetamol (for anyone who doesn’t know) and they make me feel pretty good. Although it wasn’t recreational. It was for a tooth infection. Once the pain stopped I stopped using cocodamol because I was scared of becoming dependant on it. (Ikr over 60mg of codeine for about 4 days, once a day) this was around 5 days ago since I stopped. 

So for those who didn’t read what’s above I’m 19, Male, have pretty bad anxiety and depression that I struggle to deal with. It’s a day to day thing and I am on NO other medication. I do smoke weed quite often to help bring my anxiety down but doesn’t always work. And that’s why I’m looking into opiates. I’m becoming sick of the condition I’m in and I would kill just to feel normal again. And I’ve heard tramadol acts as an SRNI also. So this got me curious and I read about people feeling euphoria. Only one person said he’s on 200mg daily and he feels great and functional. I don’t wanna be in such a high dose but I just want the edge taken away. The feeling that something is gonna go wrong wherever I go. Feelings of people staring at me and overthinking what people think about me. Overthinking every single action I make and looking back on it after to point out the flaws. 

Tramadol Is my only hope right now. I don’t wanna delve too far into the world of opiates because I have a very addictive personality and I have lost family to opiates. I don’t want to become dependant just something as a last resort when I’m feeling this SHIT.

The place itself doesn’t seem terribly awful...it’s all-womens. The counselor who did my evaluation was nice enough. The only reason why I’m down to go is because I’m on 24mg of suboxone a day rn and I hate it. I want to be tapered off but I can’t do it myself. Being clean for real sounds nice. But the thought of being locked up in this place sober af for an indeterminate amount of weeks sounds horrible.

They made me stop using heroin and pills but now I can’t stop doing cocaine and adderall even tho I’m constantly sick, still.I think this is the first time I’ve ever been truly depressed. I’m afraid this place is going to make things even worse and I won’t even know who I am or how to be when I get out.

I started using hard drugs in early high school and never really stopped. It’s been over a decade now. I don’t know how to be sober, nor a proper adult, and especially not a sober proper adult. I understand why I need to go but it’s still terrifying, and I have no clue what I’m doing.

I’ve only ever smoked h too, for the last 3 years, only 3 years, heaps of pills before that but still I feel like all the other junkies won’t even think I’m enough of one to be there. Anyone been through this with some sage advice to share?",1526859752.0

It's a long post below, I just don't really have anyone to talk to about this part of my life. 

I've been wanting to get clean for a while, I moved out to California to escape my hometown back east and attempt to get clean. Being the junkie I am though, I sought out this devilish drug, which took me no time at all to find a relatively steady connect. Its been around 9 months now since I started using out here, and I'm just absolutely miserable.

I was working some shitty job, only 20 or so hours a week, for shitty pay. I took the job originally just to get out of the fucking house, and attempt to make some friends out here, but I just very recently fucked that up. Misses two shifts because I was sick as fuck, and just didn't return or make a phone call to them mostly out of embarrassment.

Fortunately, I came from a rather wealthy family, which is both a blessing and a curse. My father pays my rent out here, luckily he just got me my own studio apartment because he thinks I'm doing better than I have been in the last 5 years of my life. Because of my addiction we've never been to close with one another. His sister died early from addiction, and alcoholism played a part in my grandfathers death as well, so has a hard time dealing with all this. Since I've moved out west, we've actually been able to form a pretty strong relationship and I talk to him daily multiple times. The fact that it's more or less built on a lie of how well I'm doing here, is beginning to eat away at me. Causing me to get waves or extreme depression lately that'll just come and go.

I got high on heroin for the first time 9 years ago at the sweet age of 16. I can honestly say up until just a few months ago I never gave a fuck about what my actions were doing to my friends and family. I didn't give a shit about frivolously spending my fathers hard earned money well because, he's rich what the fuck does it matter, I was only concerned with having a good time or getting high.Now though, it truly eats away at me, that I can be such a fucking heartless piece of shit human being. I desperately want to get clean now, because lying and using my father like this now is absolutely taking a toll on me. I just sit in my apartment everyday by myself getting high, hating life.

Today though, I was lucky. My connect gave me three suboxone’s, two bars of Xanax, and around forty 600mg gabapentin for free, because she can see the pain in my eyes (her words), and knows what its like kicking dope. I actually deleted any number that I could use to get anything, and did a shot and threw my whole set up into the trash. I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to get clean so bad in my life before. I actually cannot stand the person I am today and it quite literally makes me sick to my stomach. 

Truthfully, I wish that I had the balls to just end my life today; just put a ton of extra dope into one shot, hit a vein and fade into nothingness. Never have to deal with disappointing the ones I love the most again, and not having to ever fall back down this miserable rabbit hole. As much as I want to though I just know I don’t have it in me to do so. Which realistically is a good thing, but I really cannot picture myself having a productive fulfilling future. One where I enjoy where I’m at, what I’m doing with my life, and one where heroin isn’t involved.

Tomorrow at this time exactly, I will take my first 8mg sub with half a bar and a ton of gabapentin. I don’t just actually want it this time, and desperately need to get clean. I see the homeless out here in California, and cannot help but think how that’s going to be me, if I make it another couple of years in this hellish life. 

Sorry for the long post. Sorry for jumping around a lot in my writing as well there’s just a lot on my mind currently. Thanks for reading for all those who did. This is why I enjoy our community here at r/opiates. You all understand the struggle, the pain, the highs and lows that come with such a lifestyle. Enjoy the rest of your day everyone, cheers mates.


Edit: Not that anyone will probably see this. But I made this post on Sunday, and took my last shot at around 530pm. Today is Tuesday at 8:42pm, and I haven't gotten high. These two days are the longest I have clean, off of just dope, in the last couple of months. Ate some gabapentin yesterday when I awoke, and held me until around 7pm. Haha I then took 2 bars of xanax, blacked out. Who knows if I slept. I awoke, earlier today to find I ordered uber eats 3 times, the last was at 7am. And on my night stand was an open suboxone, so I'm guessing I took one at some point throughout the night. But no heroin, and I'm very happy.",1526856150.0

My girlfriend found out I was doing them again (after a big fight and withdrawal the first time) and now my relationship might be over.  She is understandably pissed, I’m constantly out of money and just sucking at life.  I hate myself and this shitty fucking habit.

I was trying to ween off too, which makes this more frustrating.  If I had stuck to my plan and not fucked it up this wouldn’t have happened.

Anyways, now it’s all out in the open and I’ve even told my mother who is very understanding and just wants to help.

I was on over 120 mgs a day of oxy, now I’m trying to do 30 a day.  SUCKS.  

My girlfriend has my pills and is strictly giving me 30 a day.  My worry is that all I have left are these green 187 pills, which look fully legit but I don’t feel anything.  So my runway is fucked.  Anyone have any experience with the green 187’s ?

I also bought Kratom, a brand called Kratom Kaps from a headshop.  I took 4 a few days ago and kinda scared me.  I know everyone says to order online and that headshop stuff sucks, but I’m not spending money on that.  Are these Kratom Kaps legit ?  Or do they have like bath salts in them.

I’m just trying to make it OFF.  I’m fully committed to doing therapy and meetings and everything.  I’ve been hating this habit for months.  I’m just worried about the next few days as I have to go to work and my boss is flying in from New York for meetings Wednesday .

Question: how much total fentanyl (G’s? Mg’s?) are in a 75 mcg/ph patch? Meant to be worn for 3 days. Or where can I find a calculator to figure out the total dosage?

This is far from my first time chewing the patches, and i have a pretty decent tolerance. However, I usually cut them and chew it up in smaller pieces. Today is the first time I put the whole thing in my mouth. I’ve been chewing it, off and on, for a couple of hours now and I feel pretty damn good.

Now let's go back to yesterday. I live in a bad place in the city and run trough the ""open market"" almost everyday to go to work, see some friends etc so i'm going trough my normal path when a nigga carrying a fucking gun (don't know a lot about guns but i THINK it was an ak-47, they are kinda famous around these areas) is running at my direction. I froze thinking ""this is it, there's some shooting going on and that's where i die"" but no he came running, handed me a package (while running and without saying shit) and just kept running, after 10s maybe a police car goes by full speed probably chasing that guy.


I stood there for 5min maybe thinking the guy or someone else would come back for the package but no one did so i go home. When i get home and open the package, it's like a brick on heroin. Don't know the name or number or anything like that but i've seen by photos and it was defnitely H. When i used i only got Tar so i could smoke but this shit was gray so maybe it was a better and more expensive type, don't know.


Afraid of getting smoked for stealing a whole package of dope (don't know how much it weight it either, i don't have a scale but i guess it was something around 20g or maybe 30g, i have no clue) i go to the open market at night and start talking to an old fellow i've bought before, i explained the shit to him and he got the package from me and told me to wait. He came back less than a minute then thanking me for this and saying the boss told him to get me 3g of the best dope they had. My mind is racing and the devil in my shoulders is screaming GET THAT SHIT YOU FUCKING BITCH GET THAT BITCH THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE BEST DEAL OF YOUR LIFE but i told the guy: ""No thanks, i'm clean of that shit"" and started walking, i hear the guy saying behind me ""fine man, do what you want"".

Today after going to the supermarket, some random guy came to me saying he heard of the package i gave them back and offered me some beer since he heard i wasn't using it anymore. I told thanks but i wasn't drinking either, my goal was to be 100% sober for as long as i could before i start drinking again (never had a problem with alcohol just doesn't want to change one addiction with another) so the guy gives me a lazy smile like ""nigga i give you 1 week to start getting high again"" but then he gave me 50 reais ( something around 15 dollars) and went back to his thing.

This is also helpful as I'm currently taking opiates that aren't prescribed to me. 

So, how will the process go when I take it with me to my appointment? Let it thaw a few hours and then use hot hands? How will I know it's body temp? Will it be body temp if I saran wrap it to my stomach/hip for an hour?

It all stems from a gram he fronted me, where I basically didn’t pay him on time \(the Too Long; Can’t Read version\). Let me start off by saying, these are the ideal dope dealers. We’ll call them Adam and his tough\-no\-bullshit\-sometimes\-a\-bitch girlfriend, Rachel. They usually always have good product \(BTH\), insanely good prices. First dealer in 11 years to give fronts. No bullshit \(that is, until yesterday\). They are reliable and, for the most part, very punctual. They are good at communicating quality of product, actual ETAs, hold\-ups and traffic or anything that might make them late. They deliver to my neighborhood in the boonies \(for a small fee\). As I mentioned, Rachel wears the pants in their little dope operation and can be a real bitch sometimes to keep things running smoothly. But other than that, I’ve had no complaints.

As stated above, they gave me a front on a gram. I told them I’d have the money tomorrow. Anyway, tomorrow rolls around. I leave work and don’t have time to cash my check. The girl who owes me money won’t be able to meet until later. I tell them I won’t be able to get the money together tonight, if I could just pay them tomorrow. I also told them that I MIGHT have $50 \(out of the $60 I owed\) if/when my homie comes through. Rachel says that tomorrow is fine. About an hour later, she says that they are doing business in the area and might try and come through for the money after my homie does. To make a long story shorter, homie can’t come through tonight with my money. I tell Rachel this, and she BLOWS UP my phone, basically accusing me of lying and giving them the run around in order to buy me some more time to get the money together. I tell her I will have her money in the morning \(which, remember, she had already agreed to before this anyway\).

I hit them up in the morning \(yesterday\) and we agree to meet so I can pay them and to also buy another gram. I tell them that I will find a ride \(about a half hour drive\) so they didn’t have to drive to me \(as they both have warrants\). I get to the meeting spot and she says that Adam is locked in the bathroom, “looking for a vein” trying to shoot up, that they will head over in a few. Probably 30 minutes roll by. Ok… She tells me to be patient, that they will be there. Another 30 minutes. What the fuck? Can I come to their motel room? What's going on? Another 30 goes by. She gets bitchy with me and tells me to be patient. I tell her I’m about to take off. She says “Ok, 15 minutes,” which come and go. Says she left her scale and had to go back. Another 15, then she says she left her phone and had to go back. At this point I know she is obviously lying to me. I leave to go score somewhere else.

A few hours later, the texts start coming in. She rips into me for not being patient \(I waited there for over two hours\). I tell her that it was obvious she was lying, which is ironic since she had reamed me out hard last night for supposedly lying to her and giving her the run around. I’m not just a fucking worthless junky whose time is less valuable than theirs. Fucking hypocrite… And, frankly, disrespectful. She goes off on me, and now Adam is hitting me up from another phone: “Disrespecting my girl, I’ll fuck you up bitch. Call me a liar, the last words you’ll say to me mutherfucker.” Yada, Yada, Yada. Something to that extent.

Now I’m getting it from all sides, and she tells me she wasn’t lying but that Adam had actually been up all night, locked in a bathroom, tweaking and trying to find a vein. She asks if we can drop the whole thing, and I agree. I’m at a concert, but will hit them up after to see if we can meet so I can pay them, although I’m not particularly looking forward to a meet\-up with a dude threatening me and running on huge amounts of speed and heroin and no sleep. I then text Adam the same thing, that he isn’t thinking right, and will call him after the show when he has calmed down a bit. He says, “Don’t even fucking call me.”

Holy christ, this got long… So, r/opiates, what should I do with this predicament? What am I gonna do in that situation, not defend myself? It would be a bummer to lose this connect, but I’m honestly trying to stay clean, so maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing? Obviously, I’m trying to avoid any heated, potentially violent confrontation with these people. It sounded like Rachel was willing to drop the whole situation as long as I paid, that she didn’t want to lose me as a customer. And maybe Adam was just spun\-out, acting crazy, doing asshole meth stuff? What would you do in my situation?",1526793056.0

I've just yesterday gotten the news that they will in fact hire me, which is fucking amazing! 


There's one teeny tiny issue though. They have made it abundantly clear that eventually, they will want to relocate me to their US dependency/office on account of this company being located in Hicksville Germany and me probably being the only one in the entire HQ to speak fluent English. Well this office of theirs across the pond happens to be in a major US city of all places and I'd be living in the burbs.


Now on the one hand, this is quite literally my dream come true. I've been pretty excited about the prospect of eventually returning to the US ever since my exchange year (when I was still a normoid) so for this to enter the realm of possibility... that's damn nice. BUT I'm clean (on Methadone at least). And I really really *really* love crack and Heroin. This doesn't bode well, if that major US metropolis with a reputation  of being  drug-infested is to be my next address. I have some European street smarts, but not sure how well they will work when copping in the US, especially since that new city seems wild as fuck.


Not sure what I'll do. Edited all references to a specific city, but suffice it to say it's a city I would have no misgivings about living in as a sober normoid. As a drug addict though....",1526770953.0

I just want everyone to keep reminding themselves if you're clean for any amount of time, it's an accomplishment - period. Relapses happen to a huge percentage of people who are in these shoes and it certainly doesn't mean future attempts at becoming sober are worthless; focus on the fact that you can succeed at anything. 

If you're clean, you succeeded; both success and failure are transient and you never lose the opportunity to succeed.

Whaddup scabies and gentlescum its ya boyo: the edgy, the itchy, the crispy emptymickeys! I know it's a lame introduction, but I notice when most people share their first posts, there's always that lil first day of elementary school vibe. Anyways, I love this sub, between being glued to this and /nosleep all I do is work, smoke too many cigarettes, boot dope, skateboard,and eat snickers ice cream. Ok, so now to the point of this post, biggest FML day I've had in a while. It happened February 11th, I know caus I still have my *hospital* bracelet.... decent foreshadowing.... as I've seen plenty on here, we all seem to share the (mis)fortune of having really shitty days. Well, I'm gonna tell you about my day, *Une petite* glimpse at my life at its worst, drenched in existential anguish and angst, vulnerability at its purest form. You get to watch life mock me ostentatiously. You get it, Right? It's was a shitty one.

I stared out over a canyon and watch the sun begin to rise; it had been my second night with no sleep. Which honestly sucked for me, cuz I love sleep. I'll take as may naps as I'm allowed. It was probably like my 10th time smoking crystal. Not a big fan of the methanphetamines; makes me quite, feels like I have 50 needles poking inside my gut, and I get hella bummed out and start rehashing old nightmares that I promised I was done stressing about. Anyways, i had been homeless since Jan 18, leaving me without a chance to shower. Summating to me looking like and being a dirty junkie. And if any of you guys have been tweaking for two days you start seeing things.... 
so anyways, I was attempting to cook up a shot of dope to calm me down when I felt something. It felt like bugs were crawling all over my skin which immediately made me flip out. I stopped what I was doing and started looking around, that's when I saw it. There were little bubbles/holes in everything! In the dope I was cooking, on my syringe, in the dirt, but worst of all: holes in my skin. Suffocating from anxiety, I nervously slammed my shot of dope (which looked carbonated), and immediately ran down to my friend Glitters tent at the bottom of the canyon. I was freaking out, yelling and saying that there was a disease spreading rapidly throughout the so-cal area! He scoffs me off as he goes back to sleep, so I make the great and LOGICAL decision to call my boss. It was 5am, so I left him a detailed message about the end of the world, and I can't show up to work later today blah blah blah. *SIDE NOTE* to this day, that message I left him- which he later recited to me when he fired me- was the most insane and embarrassing thing I have ever said. After I leave said detailed message for my 15 year sober boss, I call my dope dealer and warn him of what is about to happen. And that's exactly when the logic kicks in. He tells me to shut up, and asks me if I have been up smoking meth for two days. That's when it hit me. I was hallucinating. 
Regardless of my meth hallucinations, something seemed fucked up, I had holes in my skin for fucks sake! So, I continued on my journey to the nearest hospital. On my way there, I stopped to look at myself in a car side mirror. I looked terrible. Huge pupils, cuts and scrapes, dirt, and lastly, fucking holes in my face! All of a sudden, a sharp stinging emits from my temple, I see a bright light, and my ears start ringing so I take a few steps back. I guess the owner of the car saw me looking in his mirror, figured I was trying to steal from his car so he threw a thermos at my face. Stunned, I just ran away avoiding the confrontation, and went straight into the hospital to the ER.
 Long story short, a (female) doctor saw me and took my blood and asked me to strip so she could examine these holes in my skin. Now, because I had been homeless and hadn't showered for about a month, I had no idea what I looked like naked. Hadn't changed underwear, pants, sock, you name it. I was gross. Anyways, I was bashful to remove all my clothing, however, she assured me that she's seen much worse than whatever I was about to show her. Now her boost of confidence didn't help me much, but it was enough for me to get naked in front of her and two nurses. The moment she looked at me she winced, and her face turned from a smile to a disgusted face. I was covered - COVERED - in scabies. Worst of all was my Gentile area. It was terrible. Moving forward, she let me shower in the hospital and prescribed me a Litany of anti fungal and anti mite creams. In conclusion, not only did I actually end up having scabies, but I was freaking out and seeing meth bugs everywhere as well. Easily in my top 10 of worst days in my life.

Proud to say I am now 61 days clean, have a job, a place to live, and a car. My time spent in San Diego was a fucking nightmare and I hope to never go back. Just figured I'd write down one of the MANY bad memories I have of that city. Sorry if it's too long, but I didn't wanna skim through the story. Anyways lots of love. Peace!

PS: first half was written a week after the event, just found it on my notes, and figured I'd finish the story that my smacked out self couldn't. You know.

We are rolling out a new policy here at /r/opiates that **will** clear some of the clutter and riff raff out of the sub. As this subreddit has grown the dynamics of the content and userbase base has changed quite a bit and we have been getting a large influx of questions that are asked every single day, multiple times a week, and dozens upon dozens of posts have already answered these questions....so we are going to start removing them at moderator discretion. I am talking about the questions like 'how long do I have to wait to feel heroin after I just took Suboxone' and 'how do you plug/boof' or 'can I take 1500mg of tramadol and get high' type questions that have been answered very thoroughly in this subreddit and in easily accessible scholarly articles via Google.

This doesn't mean that we aren't answering questions anymore, and we definitely will not be removing anything harm reduction related, but you may be given the answer via the reddit search function and your post will be removed. We also understand that there are variables and unique approaches to some of the super common questions and they will mostly be left up.

If your post is removed for this reason you will most likely see this macro:

>Your post was removed due to the fact that it is easily answered by using [Google](https://www.google.com) or by [searching previous posts in this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) If you feel that it was removed in error you can respond to this message with your reasoning or you can [message mod mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fopiates) and we will re-evaluate this decision.

Like the macro says, if you really cannot find the answer on Google or on here and you think it's a valid question, you can respond to that removal message or message modmail that is linked in the removal reason and we will take another look at the post.

This approach that we are now going to be taking is not something that is new or unique to /r/opiates, other long standing and well regarded forums such as bluelight and opioiphile have taken this approach for many years. We are not trying to turn this place into one of those places, but we want to see quality content that generates discussion and a sense of community among the users here, not 4 posts in a row that ask if they can get high off a 5mg Vicodin and a Benadryl where people just go in there and tell them to boof it and make fun of them.

This may not be the most popular policy to be put into place, but it is something that we have been talking about for a long time and have decided that it must be implemented if we want to continue to see quality content.

Thanks for reading and working through this with us y'all,

>The /r/opiates mod team.

8kle79,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8kle79/need_help_with_this_one/,10,https://redd.it/8kle79,throwawayopiateidiot,Need help with this one..,"Hi guys, I have a bit of a problem that I hope you can help me with. I'm using a throwaway for this one.

Background:

Last year I was a recreational user of Subutex at pretty low doses, at about 0.3\-0.8mg/day in the morning, for about 6 months before tapering down and using kratom before jumping off completely without any withdrawals. I was clean from opiates for a few months before starting taking kratom again, at about 4\-6g/day in the mornings before work.

After a couple of months, a couple of weeks ago, I got somewhat depressed and got curious to try out Oxycodone for a week to manage the stress at work I was experiencing, planning to use subs if I felt any withdrawal after that, and then do a rapid taper if I needed it.

I was planning to use this weekend to wait until the withdrawal kicked in before starting using the subs. I had read up on precipitated withdrawal and knew I needed about 24 hours after the last dose to avoid that. And this weekend would be great for that since I had nothing planned and, then again, I had only planned on using the Oxys for a week. Anyways, on to the problem..

Problem:

I didn't get my subs yesterday, and I know I'm an idiot for not making sure I had them before I even ordered the Oxys. 

And on top of that, I found out yesterday that the Oxys were fake. They came in blister packs, and since I'm a bit of a noob I got fooled big time.

It turns out that they contain Methoxyacetylfentanyl. And that explained why I felt the urge to redose so damn often. After using them a couple of days I felt I had to redose about every hour. 

I have been using a quarter of a pill \(one pill is supposed to be 80mg of oxy, but obviously not\) per day for about a week now, but I have no clue what the dosage is since they are fakes, which also sucks!..

I feel mild withdrawals in the morning about 6\-9 hours after the last dose. I can't wait more than 12 hours after the last dose because I need to seem normal for work, at least need to be able to be at my ""B\-game"". And next weekend we have a get\-togheter at work which is mandatory, and I don't have the option to call in sick right now unfortunalty.

Question:

So, I figure my option is to order either H or Oxy so I get a more predictable opiate that I don't need to redose so often, and make sure I get my subs next week.

Or can I jump on the subs before the 12h mark when I feel mild withdrawal \(runny nose/eyes and sweating\), or do I risk precipitated withdrawals doing that?

I need your expertese on this one!

Thanks in advance! :\)",1526738078.0

This is so stupid, i should be able yo use IOP as a tool and speak openly to them, but instead i will be forced to come up with more lies. This is fucking stupid. I really feel like all the trouble that drugs bring has always been activated by my family. Everything will be good except ill use occasionally, then get caught. Then im kicked out, lose job.

My plan was to dose volumetrically since it was all crushed to powder and the two meds aren't very different from each other, but how long can I store the liquid concoction and should I just use water, and how much per pill? I planned to use 1mL per mg, 2 max if that won't dissolve it. That's about a week's worth of doses for me. 

Also there will be apap so I was considering CWE but I've never done so on such a large scale. Usually I just use a coffee filter but I think I'd have to use a different set up and divide it into batches. Any tips? I don't want to lose too much of the opiates.

I’ve been reading and lurking for a while and just thought I’d introduce myself. I live up in the northeast. Been taking opiates for about 15 years or so. My journey started back when I got all 4 of my wisdom teeth pulled. They were all impacted and ended up getting dry socket. I remember getting Vicodin 7.5s and I was down to my last 3. So I took them and I felt like a million dollars!!! God I miss a low tolerance. 

I chipped for many years and gradually got more and more into it. Then I started having sever health issues and I fell down the stairs at home. Wasn’t even drunk or high at the time. Was going downstairs to get a drink and my knees gave out and fell. So after blood work and mri’s and everything, I was diagnosed with Lyme disease, degenerative disc, and 2 herniated discs. Unbearable. And I went years without a diagnoses for Lyme. Multiple doctors over the years couldn’t figure out what was wrong and flat out told me there was nothing wrong with me and I was too young to have the problems I was having. They said it was all in my head until my new doctor properly diagnosed me. I got the treatment for it, but since I went so long without being treated, the damage has been done. That’s a story for another time. But I wouldn’t wish Lyme on anybody.

I love opiates but hardly use them because of the price. Please tell me if my idea will work,"So my psychiatrist is a pill pusher who doesn't gave a shit. I have more controlled meds than non controlled ones. Here is my current benzo regimen that is prescribed is 4 mg alprazolam, 40 mg of diazepam, 1 mg of clonazepam all daily. In addition, if I see him before a refill is due he will switch the benzzo so i refill my current script of let's say alpraz, and I ask for temaz he will give me that so I will have a alpraz refills and a fresh temazepam. In addition to the benzos he gives me desoxyn \(methamphetamine pills which I am currently on so please pardon the rambling, he gave me 115 mg of amphetamine a day at one point\) 16 mg of bunephorine \(I was curios about it and he said it can help with depression so he wrote me a script. Then there is the pregabalin, gabapentin, modafanil, and then some other non controlled pills like mirtazapine.

my benzos dose varies. Some nights I just need 30 mg of diaz or 2 mg of alpraz, but there a days where I can take 20 mg of a combo of alpraz diaz and clonaz. I sound coherent and I can function fine not blackout and remember everything i did. 2 mg of xan could cause blackouts in some people, and im here all fine and dandy taking 20 mg of xanax. And I dont have to worry about running out of pills.

So as I said, I am kind of being forced to go, but at the same time i need detox. Now the suboxone i dont get often because my insurance wont cover it. I buy strips every once in a while 2 for 25 bucks but it doesnt get me high like i used to. I could buy a blue for that price but i have no connects. Benzo withdrawal is hell and i feel like methadone would give me some pleasure and help the withdrawal and buy the time I'm out there wouldnt have been enough time to become dependent on it.

OK I have rambled way to long. Here is my idea. Get any dose of oxy, even 5 mg would work. They will piss test me and I will show up positive. I tell them I've been taking 90\-120 mg of oxy a day, and i tell them ive been on subs before and they gave me a horrible reaction but I have done methqdone for both macitence and detox and it works so much better. I know methadone is dangerous especially at high doses but i will be in a medical facility they can just narcan my ass. I  doubt they have the resources to check the actual levels of opiates in my piss but please correct me if I am wrong. I would appreciate you opinion and fact if you know somehow.

tl;dr Need to detox from high dose of benzos. I have no opiate tolerance but i will buy one oxy so they give me methadone so the benzo withdrawal sucks.  ",1526715387.0

After a 17 year hiatus, I am back to shooting BTH. 😎 (Cue evil dun dun dun).  Yep, I know. Lots of feelings about it. So a brief recap of my life as why I am at this point of my life; I originally started when I was 17, and was clean by 18. Barely a year of it shooting BTH. I did AA and stayed clean until approximately three years ago when I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, CFS (chronic fatigue syndrome), anxiety, and depression. 😌 The pain in my body was/is so bad I started on Tramadol within 3 weeks of being gifted this wonderful disease/condition/illness/whatever the F*** it is! 😤 After a year or so of Tramadol I slowly started Norcos as the tramadol was no longer cutting it, so forth and so on until we get to today. I think I've been using BTH for about a month now, and have been shooting for about 1-2 weeks. When I did it when I was 17, my then BF did all the dirty work for me, I mean everything. Therefore today I feel truly like a very very newbie junkie. My arms look like pin cushions, with bruises everywhere. I've even went so far as to look up on YouTube how to shoot. 😂 Ive gotten tons better at it but am left with awful looking arms I can't and won't show anybody. Anyone else relate? I am beyond grateful to have a place like this to vent. This did not exist 17 years ago, that's for sure! Lol.

Weird story...,"So, I got a hold of some powerful shit last weekend. Weird yellow powder. It's been decent, but I was also warned about it, so I haven't been doing it without stimulants, for the most part (mainly tina). I've also been mostly snorting it because... let's just say needles haven't been my friend lately.

Got into a three day bender with the other stuff, ran out of it, then needed to come down so I've just been nursing this powder. Slept great two nights ago, slept pretty well the next night, then today I've just been sort of floating through the day. But I'm running out of this powder.

I'm pretty good at tapering on my own, but here's where the stupid starts (okay I admit that's a debatable statement):  for ""dinner"" I ate a bunch of Red Vines and Sour Patch Kids. I also took some amitriptyline (sp) which I used to take for sleep but I don't like it much so I haven't taken it in a while, but I took some tonight because I started to feel very weird and wasn't sure if I could get to sleep.

Now I'm feeling REALLY weird and also really queasy, and not tired at all. I can't tell if it's because I'm coming off this stuff or if its because of my nasty ""dinner."" Either way I don't think it's going to be getting better anytime soon, and I'm just posting this because I need to bitch, I guess.

8kjfro,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8kjfro/family_problems/,11,https://redd.it/8kjfro,FedUpBro26,Family Problems,"I have a brother that has a pretty nasty Roxi addiction.  He’s in his early 30s, lives alone and has a full time job earning well over 100k usd per year. 

However, he is constantly broke and asking for money from my father or from me. I have given him about $5k over the last year in random amounts and I’m betting my father has given even more. My mother has basically disowned him bc he stole a ton of jewelry and electronics when living with my parents a year or two ago before they kicked him out which is why he now lives alone. Recently, he called me begging for help and I gave him $700 but then found out two days later he took an additional $300 from me. This is in addition to begging and being given money from my father a few days later as well. I never told my father before that I also gave him money but with him stealing and my father complaining about him needing money again, I figured we should be more united and im done protecting my brother. 

All my brother has at this point is my father and I. I don’t want to just disown him bc he’s gonna end up in jail, dead, or homeless and he is family. He has been on and off subs at times and has been to group therapy and individual therapy basically bc he’s been forced to go by my father. Thankfully he has never been arrested. He says none of the standard treatments work for him so he quits pretty quickly and as a 30+ year old, I can’t make him do anything he doesn’t want to though I have tried. In general, he doesn’t seem to want to quit and the only motivation to stop for him is the financial cost as he can’t earn enough to support his habit. 

I have done my share of drugs including roxi so I get how awesome it is but it’s hard for me to understand his willingness to steal from family over and over again. I feel that he can make whatever life choices he wants but there is no reason he can’t be self sufficient at the very minimum.  He can still have a quality, fulfilling and happy life if he quits as he has a well paying office job and no record but that opportunity won’t last forever and it’s obvious he has no desire to quit. 

How should I proceed at this point? Any advice from others who have been in similar situation would really help plus there is a chance my brother sees this and maybe the thoughs of others affect him in a way my words seemingly have not. ",1526709531.0

I'm sick of seeing this shit, you can be addicted to opiates without being a bad person.  You really think it's okay to steal someone pills? How would you feel if you just picked up a whole bunch of pills or got your scripts filled and someone pinched half? 

Ive been addicted to opiates for several years and never stole from anyone. Shoplifting is bad enough but at least you're spreading out who gets hurt. Stealing from another person is fucked and being an addict doesn't justify it. It's so fucking simple, just because it's often illegal doesn't change the fact that if you can't afford an item, you dot deserve it.

This behavior re enforces why everyone hates addicts. Why the hell would you upvote a post where someone stole meds or claims to have just boosted hundreds of dollars worth of shit?

I was working the shit out of my 12 step program. Praying every night. I was riding high on a pink cloud and for the first time in my life I was genuinely happy. 

Then out of no where and for no discernable reason the cloud disappeared and I fell into a deep depression l. This time it was worse than it's ever been. I was a cunt to my sober living house manager for a few day and so..last night I got home from a meeting and all of my shit was on the porch in the pouring rain. My computer for work. All of my books and artwork. Ruined. They told me it was time to go. They said I was on my way to a relapse and they could t allow the negativity in the house. I didnt understand where it came from. I felt like I'd just been blown up with a fucking grenade. 

My sover living house mates where all crying and begging them to let me stay. I dont believe they asked the program to kick me out. I'd been so close to all of them.

How could this have happened? The one time I stay. The one time I give it my all. Out of the 30 or so rehabs I'd been to, this time I was going to do it. 

Tonight I gave up and turned into what the program managers knew I was all along. A hopeless fucking junkie. 

I did a speedball tonight and I didnt even like it but I'm going to keep doing them until I dont care anymore. 

Sorry for the rambling, depressing wall of text. I just know that of anyone would understand howI feel it would be you guys.

Homeless and shooting speedballs in a rat infested basement at my dealers.  Welcome back to hell.

**edit:**I just did a massive speed ball and it got scary for a sec but now the nod has me right where I wanted to be. Numb. That warm blanket that makes everything better for a few hours. Right now nothing matters.

**edit 2:** tonight wasn't it. I kept doing more, got in the hole with my dboy so I *had* to come back today to pay what I owe. So of course I bought a 20 of girl. Then was talked into doing my shot there..then decided I needed a 20 for the road. This happens every time.

**edit 3**: I'm back in it. All the way in. I just had an orgasm from a speedball. Fuck. This shit is the devil but it makes you feel like you're being touched by God. I dont want this anymore but I just cant seem to find a way for it to release me. I've done the steps, I've prayed for the obsession to lift. The big book talkes about the unfortunates. The damned. That are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves.""They're such unfortunates,"" it says. Am I one of them? Is this how I'm meant to live and die? I need a purpose but I cant find one. I'm lost and scared and fucking sad and it's so easy to just stick a needle in my arm and make it all fade away. I'm not incapable of being honest..I'm just a lazy coward. I take the easy way out every time. If this kills me I'll die a coward too.

I didn’t wanna overdo it (especially since opi+benzo=possible OD) so I started small, with 2/3 of a hulk bar (1.33mg) and 150mg Tram.

It deadass took ten minutes for me to feel it, and it was a unique feeling. It wasn’t insane or extremely sedating. But it left me absolutely spaced out and consumed in my thoughts about life and “shower thoughts”. Kinda like weed, but not sedated.

Then, it got me super fucking horny for some reason... just leave it at that lmao

But it was all over in an hour. Felt sober almost exactly 1 hour after, so that really caught me off guard. But honestly it seemed really good. The simplicity of the experience was something I didn’t expect to be so relaxing.

I did this at home, but it seems like something that’d work well in a social setting, to be more social and outgoing.

EDIT: After making the post, about ten minutes passed and then I started feeling it again, but more sedated and slightly euphoric from the tram. Ended up passing out on the couch after walking in. Like it kinda felt relaxing, then stopped, then hit like a truck and knocked me tf out.

Jumped off 80mgs of methadone before this most recent stretch of subs.   That was far harsher than coming off subs....  I used kratom for the first 40 days or so, it got rid of &#37;75 of withdrawals.  I used around 20\+ grams a day.  I failed at tapering off of the kratom and went straight from kratom to taking around 200mg/daily of tianeptine sulfate for a week.  after that, nothing.....  I experienced pretty moderate withdrawals.... intense restless legs, zero sleep at first......  caved in and took some lope maybe 8, 2mg pills the first day.   That got rid of most of the rls..... dropped a pill a day down to 5 or 6 pills.... I've been able to sleep around 4 hours a night since stopping the tianeptine and taking the lope....

I thought he was kidding but he proceeded to follow me around like a puppy and comfort me whenever I freaked out and said he wanted to have a movie date and all this shit. Literally freaked me out, I was the youngest girl there  so I just thought it was creepy. 

There was a few couples there against rules. When one left she picked up the other when he AMAed. Another got fucked in the laundry room where there was no cameras. The saddest part was when this patient  and walked off and went missing because his wife called the rehab to tell him they’re getting a divorce. I thought he was gonna end up dead but he came back a week later to get his stuff so at least he’s alive.

When I walked off to make a phone call, a man tried to pick me up off the side of the road and said he’d drive me whenever I wanted. I declined, and when I returned to the rehab I was informed that the city I was in was known for sex trafficking. 

Anyways, I left after detox 12 days in. The Uber driver was shocked to have pulled up to a rehab and the ride to the airport was awkward as fuck. Lmaoo.

Anyways, I hope this doesn’t upset anyone, if it does I’ll probably end up deleting it but I had a lot of thoughts and wanted to share some of my expierence s I had when I went away last week. ",1526669746.0

I suffer from chronic pain issues and have been on different Opiates for nearly 15 years now, started off with Vicodin and Norco  (then I found a doctor who didnt know wtf she was doing and casued me to OD on a Fent patch)  eventually after a lot of trial and error and surgeries I've been on a steady dose of methadone taken as a regiment rather then as needed.  It has given me some semblance of a normal life.

This past year or maybe closer to 2 years though I notice my libido  vanishing and I have like 0 energy to do anything....my pain is under control but even for being on opiates my energy levels were no where and even watching a Janice Grffith performance didnt even cause a twitch down there.  One blood test later find out my testosterone is basically none existent.

Since I can't lower my dose and I've tried everything else for pain coming off the pain meds isnt an option so my doctor wrote me a script for testosterone and starting today when i pick it up I'm going to have to start giving myself a shot of it daily I think not sure on how often i have to dose pretty sure its daily tho.  So sorry to make a long post but I am just curious have any of you ever gone through this or known someone who has?  I know all the bad side effects that come from taking testosterone but am I going to expect those or maybe not since I'm not going over my natual levels just trying to get back to them?   3:30 am and I cant sleep so of course my brain is freaking out with racing thoughts about all the bad shit that can happen....any advice or thoughts or accounts of personal experience are welcome.",1526640084.0

I forgot where I was and it nearly felt like a dream, it was extremely dissociative. I felt extremely weird and disorientated through my mind and body.

I couldn't move at all, and I was completely paralysed. I slowly came back to myself and then my mind was perfectly clear again. What just happened here?",1526625291.0

What I hear when someone says, ""KILL YOUR LOCAL HEROIN DEALER"" or, ""If I find out who is selling drugs to 'xyz' loved one, I'm going to kill them"" is: ""I don't want to partake in any solid efforts to support my addicted loved one/community. Instead, I'm going to say inflammatory statements that resolve nothing. If I say that I'm going to kill heroin dealers it seems as if I care about the problem, while in reality I am attempting/accomplishing nothing. Nobody even expects me to follow through with this, so my statement will be applauded while doing nothing in the way of combating the ""epidemic"" OR killing dealers.""

I remember reading a post from u/arnoldnoddington1 about a week or so ago about some dude with the same thing stickered to the back window of his oversized truck. He ended up being pulled over, though he had nothing on him, because said truck driver allegedly called the cops.

Is ""SHOOT YOUR LOCAL HEROIN DEALER"" decal like a thing now? I live in the Midwest and can only wonder if so does u/arnoldnoddington1 and if the truck i saw was the same one with the same douche driving it.

Anyway I will have access this weekend to a good amount of 15mg morphine sulfate. I had 25 of them last weekend and feel I wasted them by taking them orally. The most I took at once was 6 and first time was a pretty good buzz but wore off quickly and long story short the pills only lasted me 2 days.. and I was told it is def worth it to try plugging. little background I am a heroin addict and have been oxy/h addict for 3 yrs now. I do h almost daily. My roa is insufflation, I have never stuck a needle in me and don't intend to start now because I know that would make things 100x worse. So I don't want to waste these things again when I get my hands on them. I don't even know where to begin when it comes to plugging.

* How much has it affected your town in terms of overdoses? 
* Whats typically going around on your streets? 
* How easy is it to get harm reduction supplies? 
* Are maintenance meds easily obtainable, and how affordable are they \(i.e. prices of clinics, prices of subs or methadone on the streets\)? 

And lastly... not everyone may know this, but how hard is it for pain patients now where you're at?
