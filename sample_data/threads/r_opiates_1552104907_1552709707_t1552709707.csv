I wish there was something out there that would lower your tolerance. I would pay top dollar for that shit.

Oh and the worst part about tolerance?? It kills people. Usually in the sense that someone gets clean, relapse, and think it's ok to go back to same dose they were on before getting clean!

Idk, just a little rant. Currently trying to use my shit as much as I can, but having a hard time getting a nod. Might have to take another week off of it again to lower bullshit tolerance.

It doesn’t feel that way. Feels much longer. Feels like it was a different life, but I remember it. I miss it, I miss it a lot actually. It was always there for me and always made me feel so.... safe. Nothing can put me in such a state, nothing and no one. I don’t care who/what it is. I don’t care what they can offer. A thought that often crosses my mind: How much further can I go? How much further can we all go? How much can it take for one to just break? It’s pessimistic, but with the way I think about it now, I KNOW I will fall one day. I KNOW one day it will lure me in. I KNOW I will inevitably give in and return to the one thing that no matter how low or how down I am, it will lift me up. What a devil it truly is. But it feels so... safe. I’m gonna keep using that word, safe. It feels safe and right. I dream about it still. It shattered my family, delayed my education, took away the woman I loved, but it doesn’t matter... it feels so safe. I would kill to forget what it feels like. I would kill to have it not exist. But it does exist, and I know what it feels like. I know it can liberate me of any and all pain. I know it can topple all sorts of everyday life sober pleasure.

My mother often can tear up whenever on the news she hears about how the opioid crisis are only growing. She has even called me saying how it has gotten worse, and how she is worried. It pains me to know I think about it this way, thinking in a way that I know it would kill the woman who raised me and cared about me all my life. But it doesn’t matter. As fucked up as it sounds, it doesn’t matter. It makes you feel just too safe. It’s like a succubus. Unlimited pleasure for your life. How can you say no to that? How can you remain away from it? It’s easy if you listen to society and stay away off the bat, you can’t comprehend what it’s like. But for the rest of us, will we ever be truly free?",1552697024.0

Hope everyone is having a good Friday. I don’t do opiates all the time, but when I do I binge pretty good. For example I’ll snort a lot of pills and H for 30-45 days straight and then realize my body and life are slowly going to shit and then stop. Then I’ll go a good 4 months without using at all and repeat the cycle. 

Well I’m currently in the middle of a binge, this time mostly sniffing H. The problem I am having this time is I am having serious trouble going pee. I am a 32 year old male, healthy (I just got blood work done and it came back all good). I constantly feel like I have to take a piss but when I try nothing comes out. Just a little dribble here and there. I very rarely get a solid stream going. It’s horrible having to get up every 10 minutes to try and pee and nothing happening. It’s also painful feeling like you have to pee but not actually peeing. I know this sounds weird but every time I try to pee it’s like my brain won’t cooperate with myself trying to pee even though I very much need to.

But I vibed with him and I got the room. This is my first time ever renting on my own in my life and I'm 21. I'm so stoked I got the room I have no urge to use tonight. That and fuck a physical dependance it I can.

Fast forward 1:30 am today so I waited from earlier to get high it’d been 28-27 hours since I had taken that sub I did a shot prolly half a G hardcore pine and needle ( high morphine content) got super itchy as rush set in so I pack my Kit away and lay down to go to sleep,
When I lay down I began to like sink, not like fall or anything but I feel like I’m sinking in quicksand, then I get this overwhelming feeling of (for lack of better word) smallness? I felt tiny I look at my TV and it looks massive, as I look around my room I looks massive I grab my vape and as I reach I notice my hand and it looks like my arm is extending  to like the other side of the room... so I hit my vape grab my phone and my phone is massive, my eyes can’t focus I can’t even read the time on my phone it felt like I had my phone pressed up against my face,
I start to get nervous and call my lady  and wake her up, I begin telling her what’s going on she proceeded to tell me I’m slurring my words, and at this point I’m super confused and can’t hold a sentence cause I keep losing thoughts we come to the Conclusion that it’s Alice In Wonderland Syndrome (AiWS) yes it’s a real thing. But I had like all symptoms and my symptoms were same.
All in all it was pretty freaky I didn’t sleep and still havnt but it ended around 6am and lasted a freaky 4-5 hours,

—Discuss withdrawal ease methods with me— I will actively respond to comments and messages. (I may or may not have professional knowledge on the subject from both sides of the spectrum - addiction and addiction treatment)


This post is about switching to maintenance and lowering tolerance quickly with a legal substance almost painlessly.... not about getting off all opiate agonists completely. 

You WILL HAVE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS FOR AT LEAST 3 DAYS using this method.... the withdrawal however will be lessened substantially and you will be able to do most everyday tasks like go to work without having hot flashes after ONE DAY..... one day of pain will be needed to begin your induction of subs and ultimately trigger your body’s natural processes to begin again..... your body is triggered to start making its own neurotransmitters that your dope has been doing for it........ the purpose of this method is to lessen the shock to your body of having to produce its own opiate receptor agonists and to eliminate post acute withdrawal symptoms that lead many to relapse before their tolerance has substantially reduced.

If you’re unable to source these prescription withdrawal aids legally from a doctor... the onion fields may help you get some of these prescription withdrawal aids... otherwise Kratom in liberal amounts may substitute for the subs and other herbs may be substituted for all Rx’s listed here.
I should also note I also smoke liberal amounts of weed during withdrawals.

Supplies: 1. 1 or 2 suboxone/subutex 8mg
 (or methadone in quantities well below what makes you “well”... this substance is more complicated to transition with, but ultimately has the benefit that you don’t have to be in withdrawal to induce it)

2. Benzo of choice, pref clonazepam... but any will work.(Benzo addicts sub seroquel for benzos, or only use benzos for first day of transition for sleep). - phenibut is an option in place of benzos but do your own research on this substance and do not use except for the transition day. 

3. High quality kratom extract from online or even one brand of Gas station Kratom extract  liquid shot or other kratom extract, (Strongest locally is readily available at most “sketchy” gas stations” in tan bottle with green leaf) - be careful to avoid most liquid shots at headshops/gas stations..... there is only one specific brand that is worth much.. and only use it If not prepared with extract from a reputable online cheap source or if you run out of the cheaper options during the acute phase...

4. Multivitamin, B vitamin complex, fish oil, valerian root, 5htp.. many other herbs/supps said to help with withdrawal.. research herbs but definitely get these 4 (USE THESE BEFORE YOU START W/Ds and continue them for a year or the rest of your life even...) .. drop the 5htp and valerian root after you find you have tapered off completely from Kratom...

Possible herbal aids:
Ashwaghanda (KSM-99),
Black seed oil,
Ginger root,
Valerian root,
Many many more have proported benefits during opiate withdrawal.... do your research but these are some I can recommend... 

5. High quality Kratom plain leaf of choice 

Optional rx’s: clonidine, gabapentin... seroquel(for sleep). (CLONIDINE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) (Gabapentin highly recommended for addicts with true pain)
Zantac for some with stomach issues; some have adverse reactions to Zantac. - use these for about a week. 

METHOD: LISTED BY SUBSTANCE (not chronological)

Day 1-4: (SUBS) after at least 12-24 hours when you are in full opiate withdrawal use the minimum amount of sub to take care of pain... you will only be dosing these for 3 days. Use the minimal amount to make W/ds bearable but do not use an amount that takes the w/ds away completely so that your receptors are still recovering while still having some sort of calming effect of the subs... you should still feel withdrawals for the first three to four days... don’t use so much subs that you’re not withdrawing as you will not actually be detoxing yourself... just use the minimum amount to get yourself through whatever you have to do that day... 

If you want to reduce your tolerance quickly, induct the smallest possible amount, if you want to be able to feel normal after the first day, then induct a larger amount —> inducting with smaller amounts will lead to a longer transition period but ultimately require less time tapering and less kratom to maintain while your receptors stabilize over the next month


Days 1-5: (BENZOS). (Clonazepam, Valium, Xanax, Etizolam ect) First three days use benzos liberally but know your tolerance as these can be overdosed on just like opiates, most addicts probably know what they need but if you are new to benzos general guideline is don’t take more than 1 pill of any of these preps your first time... 2mg max per dose... you probably won’t need that much per dose though, depending on your tolerance and body weight and general cravings/wanting to bang your head against the wall...benzos will take care of this.. after three days only use a max of 2mg to sleep... take 1-2 hours before you’re ready to try to sleep... sleep still may not come easy. You may continue to use benzos past day 5, but make sure you are lessening your dose each day until off as you do not want to gain an addiction to these (FORMER BENZO ADDICTS — use trazadone or seroquel at night for sleep and clonidine during day) — SEROQUEL MAY BE SUBSTITUTED FOR SLEEP AID ONLY.  Do not use during day, you will most likely fall asleep. 

Days 1-7- use clonidine and gabapentin at recommended Rx dosages for a week to help control acute withdrawal symptoms

Day 1-30- in place of benzos use valerian root at night.. may use during day if you are still craving hard on top of the Kratom... start the valerian root BEFORE stopping benzo usage... you can start valerian root in your prep for coming off of your drug of choice full agonist opiate in combination with benzos... the valerian root will both act synergistically with the benzo and after ceasing use will provide some of the same effects without the addiction potentional... (BENZO ADDICTS may choose to ONLY use valerian root throughout the taper, be careful if you choose to use a benzo for the transition days 1-3) 

thanks u/fdkol for pointing out the need for Valerian root to build up in your system. 

Day 4–>onwards— get KRATOM liquid shot extract from a gas station if you’re still in deathly pain... use one or two of those a day depending on your habit .. for oxy under 100mgs/day one should cover your w/ds.... drink most of it then save a little in the bottle, carefully drip some drops of water in bottle and shake to get residual extract.... let this leftover extract/water sit under your tongue for about 5-10 minutes then swallow with some more water.... you’ll be feeling right and you can taper from there.... these are the strongest to use during withdrawals from hard opiates.... take your first oral liquid shot of the extract when you start feeling goose flesh from subs leaving your system... may use plain leaf in place of extracts if you feel like your tolerance is low enough at this point... 

—>if you’re already feeling better on plain leaf stick with it if you’re under about 15gs a day you’re doing well... I save extracts specifically for withdrawals from harder substances, I recently tapered off of opiates for about the 6th time painlessly using High quality kratom extract and then a high quality online vendor for plain leaf after about three or four days of combining with the extract to get maximal relief...

Do not continue to use the shot after about a week or you will find yourself addicted to the extract... switch to plain leaf and taper from there.... kratom is legal and readily available in most states. If your withdrawals are not extreme on day 4, begin with plain leaf instead at whatever dosage allows you to feel normal... after about a week you should be off of extract and using plain leaf only.. as kratom extract is expensive in comparison to plain leaf.
(Online is cheapest, I suggest kratom extract only during acute withdrawals)

Off of opiates: after about a month or two of kratom use, tapering down each dose about 1-2 grams a week.... (starting at about 10g doses twice a day, morning and evening)... switch to a single dose a day... continue to taper as slowly as a quarter gram of Kratom of week... and you will find yourself jumping off painlessly.... 


Using this method the only first 1-3 days are uncomfortable and the kratom will take care of cravings (PAWS) until your receptors are back in working order as you taper down...... 


- I may or may not be a medical professional who is a former hardcore addict. I believe in the usage of both herbs and pharmaceuticals for detox and maintenance. Kratom is by far a better choice for maintenance compared to methadone and subs if you can not completely get off of all opiates

But i need sex advice and i trust this community's opinions,"So I'm gay and have only had sex with one person, my ex, probably hundreds of times. But I still feel like a virgin. I'm a weird person, I'm very shy awkward and hard to open up. Especially in bed, it's almost impossible. It took my ex months to get me comfortable in bed, but once I was I was a good passionate fuck. My nervousness also causes me to lose a boner sometimes. I haven't had sex in over a year. 

Anyways, I met a friend through a friend that is in town for a week. The sexual tension between us is obvious and our mutual friend has confirmed that we're both down. I invited him to come over tomorrow night and hes down but i'm so damn nervous. 

So here's my question: should I disclose to him that I'm a shy and nervous person but still 100% down before he comes over? Or while he's over? Or not at all? I don't want him to think I'm not enjoying myself, but I know I'm gonna be really nervous and it might come across that way. I'm picky as fuck and this guy is supremely awesome, we're both very into each other. I know I sound like a 16 year old but I'm in my mid twenties and I still got these issues lol. He's in his mid 30s so he's much more experienced than me. I feel like this is a really good opportunity to overcome some of this nervousness I have. Should we drink? Should I take some benzos? Experienced people out there, how would you handle a person like me? I know I sound like a baby but I'm really trying to grow out of it!

Well me and my guy had a big falling out because he was acting like his shit didnt stink and he was better than everybody cause he sold a few grams of smoke. 

 Anyway fast forward to now. His sister was gonna hook me up with some kpins last night then her guy ended up selling them out too fast so he said well i have some blues. So i said great are they scripts?? They swore up annd down and even now, theyre saying theyre from a scripts. Well my friends little sister was bsing with me all day over texts saying this and that about them and what not, so i was thinking well what the hell, it wont hirt to do one or 2 after being 2 years clean off h and prolly 3 or 4 years clean from roxys. So i tell her yeh come on and bring them and ill throw you an extra 10$ for bringing them this far. Well i told her come with only one or two people because alot of pwoplw in this city dont like me for various reasons. .. so she pulls up 6 hours later with 5 ppl in a car. The bigger guy she was with got out of the front and hopped in the back with me. They said ""lets see the money first"" i said ok here you go and gave it to him, then said lemme see them. So hes counting my money and it was clearly real and shouldnt have been alot to count seeing as it was 3 20's. Well they show me the pills and it was clearly pressed. Wasnt even the right soze of blues. Alot smaller and had horrible jagged edges. So i dropped them on the ground and snatched my money back with the same motion and hopped out and said ""nahhhh theyre pressed fent if theres anything in them"" so the guy said ooookkkkk...???

Before that, I'd been copping eights weekly, on and off, and smoking through them in usually 5 days. 

While he was dry, I wasn't sure if I'd have to go through withdrawals, so to play it safe I started taking really high doses of codeine daily. I would do a cold water extraction on literally 80 fucking pills (8mg codeine/500mg paracetamol per tablet), and then take about 600mg of codeine. I'd rarely feel high but I guess it helped with not having to experience withdrawal symptoms.

He finally hit me up again last week, and I started off by copping an eighth as usual. I blew through that shit in just one weekend. I'd be high throughout the entire day, nod off for a few hours, and then be unable to sleep at night because of the cozy opiate-induced naps I had taken  earlier. Then throughout the night, I'd think to myself, ""okay, just one more hit before I lie down so I can fall asleep easier"", but it was never enough. I'd end up staying awake until sunrise just taking hit after hit, trying to get high enough to fall asleep. I don't know what it is, but ever since I started doing dope (I switched over from Oxy), I don't get that ""warm blanket"" feeling anymore. Dope just makes me drowsy. I still like it, but it's not the same. 

Anyway, after blowing through that eighth over the weekend, I re-upped on Tuesday with a quarter ounce. It cost me a ton of money but I figured it should last me a while so it was worth it. But lo and behold, after weighing what I had left last night after using for just two days, I realized that I had gone through over 6 fucking grams. This shit has gotten out of hand.

I thought shit was out of hand when I was popping 10 Perc 10/325s every morning, too lazy to even do a CWE. But now I'm smoking through 6g of dope in two days. I can't tell if I'm doing better or worse. ",1552667521.0

https://youtu.be/v-NH6TGZTcc


Okay, so lets stop being a trogaldyte, and lets act with dignity and class. 


1) Rule 1 - Always shower and wear clothes that are pressed and neat. Remember, manners maketh the man.

2) Always compliment the dealer on something. Make him feel good. Everyone always asks the dboy for shit....but no one stops to ever asks....how the dboy's shit is going?


3) NEVER BLAST RAP. (or country), some classic rock is okay, but at a quiet library level, remember, this is a residential area most likely, it's 2PM, people are still fast asleep. Preferably listen to Vivaldi. 


4)Never be late. Your dealer is always prompt (he runs on Gandalf time, he's never late, BUT YOU ALwAYS ARE).

5)Be sure to empty your car of the urine bottles from last week.

6). Gucci Flip Flops in the summer, never white after labor day. Come on, class guys.






7) Be sure all the money is facing the right way, and in order of number sequence. 


8) Always carry business cards. Nothing's classier when meeting a new plug, then exchanging a business card that says ""Lana C. - Putting the Hero in heroin. And hookers too. ""

9) MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL. NEVER COLD COP IN THE HOOD wEARING A SECURITY GUARD OUTFIT. Lol I learned this from experience.

Come up with a unique line that expresses your heroin addiction perfectly!


Now my friend, you have repekt. The hood all respects you. That pussy gonna be fallin from the sky like someone just pimped out your wheelchair.

Congrats you now have the dignity of an idiot if you followed any of this! But if you forgo rule 9 and still cold cop, you are totally the Chad Junkie.

I’ve just never had this happen after any of my binges. The day after I felt just bleak and meh. Didn’t have work so stayed in bed. Second day went to work felt bleh a little off. 3rd day really didn’t feel much at all. 4th I just feel pissed off extra but that’s prob cuz having a shitty situation getting to work idk. 

I’ve gotten WDs off of a 2 weeks binge plenty of times. Not saying I’m missing them AT ALL. It honestly feels like a get outta jail free card cuz I have shit to do and didn’t wanna be any form of sick. 

Just curious if anyone has similar experiences or heard of it. I did have a 2 year long habit before with a 1 year IV habit too. 

Thanks package that never came on time... it might land it might not but it’s honestly kinda nice. I still hate life rn tho ",1552654340.0

If it were just constipation it wouldnt be as big of a deal but I seriously believe its causing me serious sleeping issues.

Im not drowsy or tired throughout the day but when I sleep its for 10+ hours every night. I could sleep longer if i wanted to but I dont, its becoming a serious hindrance to my quality of life because im fking sleeping so much.

Does anyone have any recommendations on types of low cost daily food that I can eat that will help me? I know exercising helps A LOT, but its hard. Like I said I dont have fatigue throughout the day but my motivation is shot when every single day I feel like ive wasted from sleeping through the majority of it.

I am a heavy 30 blue pressed fentanyl user. I don’t drink so my use allows me to maintain a pretty good life on the surface. Good job, nice car, etc.   I say this because it came into play today. 

I hadn’t seen my guy for a couple of days and was hurting and I hadn’t eaten in a while. I drove out and lunch and met him in the parking lot of a jack in the box.   I grabbed them and knowing as soon as I used I would be hungry for something sweet I went through the drive through and got a shake.   After that I headed towards the highway back to the city.  Obviously I needed to use so I pulled over on a side street. Parked, pulled out my glass to crush and snort off of, and looked up....neighbor staring right at me. Time to move on. 

I jumped back in the road but it was only a couple of block to the highway. With no other spot I jumped on the on ramp and got on the highway.  This is where my arrogance about looking like “an average joe” almost got me.  This is a two lane each way highway with a speed limit of 60.   I pulled right off to the shoulder and put on my hazards. I then pulled out my kit and crushed a few.  As I put my credit card down I looked in my rear view.....sheriffs deputy. 

I have to say I didn’t panic even though I had 4 crushed blues and 15 more in the door compartment.   I lifted the center console and placed the glass in it.  I then grabbed the jack n the box shake and poured it over the passenger floor and my right hand.  I then put my ice cream covered hand and smashed cup out the window.  His door was open at that point.....then he closed it.  When it was clear he pulled up next to me and rolled his window down. I told the truth “spilled ice cream all over my car”. He said “bummer” and drove off.

Bit of background: I was born with a disease that brought me chronic pain by the time I was 5. I spent most of my childhood in and out of the hospital and have vivid memories of 8 year old me trippin on whatever drug the doctors pumped me with.  At age 14 I had access to all kinds of opiates. Hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, and dilaudid were forever present on my nightstand and in my school lockers. Because of my medical history no one thought it was weird that a varsity cheerleader and chess club captain had bottles of pills in her backpack. 

By 16 my life was pretty routine. Wake up at 6 am. Roll over and take the cocktail of pills maintaining my health, on the bus by 7:20, take an oxy and off to school. At this point I couldn’t even get out of bed without them, they barely helped the pain but they kept me happy enough to keep going. 

At 17 I had a bone marrow transplant. This was the toughest thing I’ve ever done in my life. I spent a year away from home  being depressed, fighting for my life and, fighting back my craving for dilaudid. Eventually I was cured and my doctors told me if I wanted to go home I had to get off all opiates. So I stopped. I graduated highschool, and applied for university. I went off to college at 19 and spent the next 6 years grinding. I worked three jobs, got good grades, and managed to get my first kiss.  
I got a tooth pulled and after my doctor handed me a prescription for dilaudid, I ripped it up and threw it away. I never took anything stronger than ibuprofen for those 6 years.

Last month I tried to take my own life. I spent a week in a psych ward got officially diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, and depression. After working so hard for my independence I’m now 27, jobless, and living with my parents. I stayed clean yet here I am. 

I don’t want to die and I’m hopeful for my future but I am so tired of the disappointments. I can’t handle another major set back and I’m tired of fighting. 

Throughout the years I had a fascination with heroin. I never understood how or why people could devote their lives to it. Yeah the warm rush after taking dilaudid is nice but not THAT nice. Family, friends, and orgasms are all better in my opinion. 

But now all I can think of is leaving everything and trying heroin. It’s the only thing I can think of that will quiet my mind. I stalk this sub and watch countless documentaries about addiction. I’m obsessed with it. I truly think it’s the only thing left on earth that will bring me peace. I’ve let go of my ambitions. Is it worth it?

I don't drive and am mostly at the mercy of my mom and husband and it was hard enough to ask her if she would stop at a rec pot shop yesterday! My husband won't even take me because he thinks I'm going to use it to get too high to care for our daughter. I bought some 5:1 CDB and THC, but I'm regretting not getting the 1:1 oil.

I don't have anyone who I can borrow anything from anymore since she went fucking nuts on me and my daughter (I threatened to shoot her and then call the cops for breaking and entering. Don'tdevelop a relationship with your employees). I ran out of my Percocet on Monday and Tuesday I wasn't so bad, but stood talking to my neighbor for an hour. I went out with my mom and my stepfathers niece for 10 hours yesterday, we walked most of it.

I've had 13 surgeries, got into a terrible accident between my Ford Ranger and a semi, have Charcot Marie Tooth disease which badly affects my feet, broke my foot back in September (avulsion fractures are common with CMT because the muscles and nerves don't communicate right), and I'm a proper disaster. 

I've never used crypto currency before yesterday at the bud hut either so I don't know how to use the DW. I haven't tried Kratom before since my stomach is just terrible on its own. Lope doesn't do shit for me (except the obvious) even when I take much higher doses because I took a lot for a year after having my gallbladder removed. 

My family has cut me off from any of their opiates and the only one I could get some from is my stepdad. He only gets tramadol and I can't take that since it has a bad habit of causing seizures and I have epilepsy. Probably caused by the Mexican tramadol I was taking since it happened 2 days after we got back.

I'm rolling around the house in my wheelchair and have my knees wrapped in ace bandages. It's terrible enough pain that I'm using my wheelchair again! My kitten loves it, sleeps in it, rides around in it, won't move so I can use it, and loves rolling around with me. I can't walk or stand for longer than 5 minutes today.

They are XR but i ofcourse crushed them before i took them. It was my first time ever with opiates, so i took my time researching shit and being careful. 30 mgs orally IR was supposed to be a heavy dose for someone without a tolerance. 

Since i had no tolerance, i decided to take 20 mg crushed and downed them with water on a half-full stomach. 50 minutes later i felt literally nothing at all. Not even placebo. waited 15 min more to make sure, but still nothing.

&#x200B;

I took 1,5 pills (15 mg) more 70 minutes after my original dose, and about 40 minutes after i took the additional pills, i started to feel something finally. It was pleasant but i was barely feeling anything when i was laying down. I could feel the ''tingling'' in my feet, and i felt a little warm and itchy, but the mindful euphoria felt only slight. It felt like i was still very underdosed, either that, or i am severely dissapointed with the effects of opiates.

&#x200B;

I decided to take 2 more cause i was getting irritated. (do you know how hard it is to get pharma-sourced drugs in my country?) I crushed them and i was now at 65 mg total 60 minutes after i took the last 1,5 pills (now about 170 minutes total after original dose). Now finally 200 minutes after my original dose, on 65 mgs on morphine i could finally say i was knocked over and i was bed-bound with a waves of euphoria coming from everywhere (the itches came from everywhere, too!). I know i wasnt close to OD'ing because breathing was not a problem at all and i could move easily and talk. My chest just felt a little heavy. It felt like between a moderate and heavy dose.

&#x200B;

So i was 35 mgs over what erowid, psychonaut and a bunch of redditors considered a ''heavy dose'' before i was satisfied. 

&#x200B;

So what could cause this? Am i just naturally tolerant to opiates or are these pills just weird? they came from an official blister-pack. I weigh about 70 kgs. male. 187 cm.

Someone commented in there and asked me to post it in this sub. Don't know if the mods will allow it, or if it's even the kind of thing that most people in here want to read about.

I was on opiates for a long time, though, so I figured there would be people in here who could relate. I'm not in NA or anything, so I'm not all about the sober life or being judgemental about this stuff. I'm responsible for what happened to me, and my own choices were *definitely* involved in that. When I started out, I knew I was on a gold-paved road to hell, but I chose to keep walking down that road.

After a few years, I started taking subutex and I was on that daily, for 10 years. I finally comitted to quitting, and tapered down over about three months. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't as difficult as I built it up in my head to be. The hardest part was just confronting the fear and dismissing all the shit in my head that kept convincing me to put it off until later.

Now that I've started Modafinil i feel like my methadone dose is starting wear off around the 12-14 hr mark.

How vital is it that I take a shit/empty my bowels before administering a dose rectally? I've been a shooting fiend for a long time and I take a dump literally once every couple of days. Is it absolutely necessary to make sure I have a bowel movement every time I plan to take a dose in my ass?

Hey I'm just kinda posting this to get shit off my chest. I've never really posted on reddit before but have lurked mostly. Kinda inbetween a permanent place to chat/socialize on.

 I was a big time junkie on fentanyl for years and I eventually ended up on a methadone program. I had originally started taking percs (no script) for a back injury I had when I was 19. My best friend at the time had a dad with a fucked up back and a percocet prescription. My back never got better, even to this day, and I naturally progressed through the stages of being a junkie. A Perc here and there led to a couple percs a day. Then progressed to 10 percs a day. Next I went to 40mg of oxycontin a day which led to 80mg oxy a day which were usually snorted since these were the pre neocontin days. Once oxy prices became unmanageable I found fentanyl patches. Those fuckers used to last a couple of days. I believe they were 100mcg patches (I think? It's been a long time). Once our tolerance built we were going through 2x100mcg patches a day.

Eventually my girl and I, who was also as big of a junkie as I was, cleaned up with the help of a methadone program. She became pregnant after 3 years on the program and she tapered off before the first 3 months of pregnancy and stayed clean. Unfortunately I've never gotten off the program and have been on it for about 8 years now. Its embarrassing and I regret ever trying opiates. I'm too scared to get off now because my back hurts everyday even with my 100mg dose of methadone a day. I dabbled with several muscle relaxers over the years and I've finally just gone cold turkey off them. 

During my time on methadone I've gone through phases of doing coke. For about 2 years I was doing coke in secret from my family and living a miserable existence. I nearly committed suicide by taking a handful of clonazepam and tying bag around my head and passing out. My girl found me and ripped it off my head before anything happened. After that my coke habit became my coke dependance. I was doing blow at work, at home, on the way to and from work. To counter the coke come down i would eat handfuls of clonazepam, restorals and xanax. I'm honestly shocked I didnt die during this. It makes me feel sick just typing it out. It was probably the worst period of my life. 

Eventually the lying and sneaking around became to much and I told my girl everything. She gave me an ultimatum of her and my son or drugs. I chose them. It's been 8 months since my last bag of coke. I have taken restorals maybe 3 or 4 times during periods where I felt I couldnt do it anymore. I'm still on methadone and feel better then I've ever felt in my life but I still feel like something is missing. I dunno if it's the thrill of seeking and acquiring drugs that I miss or what it is but I cant figure it out.

I'm off heroin for over a week now.,"I wanted to relate my past and present experiences of trying to quit heroin, and how kratom helped me. I've been an opiate addict since 2008. Started on Oxy 80, graduated to shooting heroin by 2010. There was a period where I was on suboxone but I mostly just sold them to get actual dope. Finally, cold turkey with no suboxone I was able to get clean for 7 years. It was fucking torture. When I was forced to stop in 2012, I had serious depression and post acute withdrawals for at least 6 months if not much longer. I also picked up a bad drinking habit. 

Now, I relapsed back in October after years of being away from opiates. Spent about 15 grand in about 5 months on heroin. I attempted to stop but couldn't do it. I went to the ER and they gave me suboxone about 12 hours after my last shot. It did nothing to stop the cravings. It might have helped me slightly physically... but as we all know, it's not the physical part that's hard.  I took 8mg total. Shot more dope on top of the suboxone (dumb). 

Then, I started taking large amounts of Kratom. There was two days of really terrible WD, but I cannot explain how important the kratom was in keeping me from running off and coping. Heroin is so strong, that nothing with really kill 100% of the WD. However, I truly believe that it improves WD by about 33%. This is just enough help to get through those first few days. The real magic though happens later. 

Like I said, when I went cold turkey I had post acute WD for months, maybe even a year. Kratom has completely cured those symptoms. Depression, exhaustion, constant cravings? All gone... sort of. I wake up feeling WD and cravings but I take the kratom and about 30 minutes after, the symptoms go away. 

Having been on suboxone before, I can honestly say that Kratom is much stronger. Now, I may be addicted to Kratom but who fucking cares? You can buy a year's supply for the cost of a weeks worth of heroin. I'm not going to steal from my family to score Kratom. It simply doesn't work that way. 

The bad part about Kratom is that it's difficult to ingest. I toss and wash the powder straight which is disgusting and easy to fuck up. Stay away from capsules because they don't work quick enough. If you are starting out, I recommend buying a package of [oblate bags](https://www.amazon.com/Pip-Oblate-Bag-Type-Japanese/dp/B000FQOFLO). You can fit about 5 grams of kratom inside. A good dose for a person trying to stop opiates would be 10 grams. So two of these things filled up. You will have to do this 3 or 4 times per day. 

I want to say the other part that has left me stable and confident in not relapsing is that I asked for help. I told my family that I relapsed. Having their support and giving myself accountability was also key. However, the Kratom is truly magic in it's ability to minimize WD and solve post acute WD.  More so than Suboxone. ",1552578430.0

I am pretty sure these guys have some kind of hive mind, because they all act the same. Big Slim functioned in units of 15 minutes for everything. He was always 15 away, even when I knew he was delivering something on the other side of town. And when he ran out of dope, he would be reupping in 15. Guaranteed.

I guess the 15 minute rule is sort of like a Hippocratic oath. You have to swear when you get your dealer cert. I heard they have a ceremony with upside down crosses and pentagrams and such, but I can't say for sure.

b10kj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/b10kj2/question_regarding_amount/,26,https://redd.it/b10kj2,crimlawyer123,Question regarding amount,"I have a question - I think I know the answer but just need to double check. I am a criminal lawyer and working on a clients case. 

One one occasion LE says that my client bought $1200 worth of heroin (wire taps) and following a traffic stop 12 packets containing 12 baggies were found. LE claims that the weight of the drugs are 78 grams. 

According to law enforcement: *""Law enforcement transported JANE DOE and JOHN DOE to the XXXXX Police Department, where they were searched. In JANE DOE’s upper shirt/bra area, law enforcement found and seized 12 bundles, each of which contained 12 Ziplocbags, and one loose bag, for a total of 145 Ziploc bags.The DEA laboratory determined that the substance inside these bags contained heroirr and weighed approximately 78.7 grams.""*

Common sense tells me that there is no way you are getting heroin or fen laced heroin - 78 grams for $1200. It should be .1g in each zip lock baggie - right? 144 baggies x .1g = 14grams (just under $100 a gram). They have to be including the weight of the packaging materials to get to 78grams. 

On another occasion LE says that my client bought $800 worth of heroin and following a traffic stop *""Law enforcement seized from Jane Doe’s bra a Ziploc bag, which contained 8 bundles of 11 or 12 Ziploc baggies each, totaling 95 plastic baggies, each of which contained a white powdery substance and was marked with a green leaf logo on one side. The contents of the baggies field tested positive for heroin and weighed approximately 73 grams.""*   Again, common sense tells me you are not getting 73g for $800 and it is really 95 baggies x.1g = 9.5grams. 

Law enforcement also states: *""Based on my training and experience, on the training and experience of other law enforcement agents with whom I have spoken, I believe that the quantity of narcotics Jane and John Doe purchased on or about August 10, 2018 and August 16, 2018, exceeds a user quantity and is consistent with distribution.""*  

Law enforcement calculation of 151 grams (78g and 73) would probably be too much for user quantity for 2 people for 2 weeks - right? However, 23 grams (14g and 9g) would be consistent with a user quantity for two people for two weeks. Someone could easily do a gram a day - right?

I haven't used heroin in almost two years by that point. My first opiate relapse was on some IV morphine back in November and since then some tramadol and oxy a few times, but those were small and separated instances. After some will power and desperation I ended up buying 3 grams of high quality BTH

In the past 7 days I did about 2 grams of it. I mostly smoked but today I started IVing again. I just did my last shot and flushed the last gram down the toilet and threw away all the rigs and other paraphernalia. I have an amazing life since getting clean and an incredible partner that has no idea I've been using. I am determined to quit as I did before. In my previous use (IV) I never got too terrible of withdrawals. This week I smoked quite a bit throughout the day even when I knew it wouldn't do something. 

&#x200B;

My question is: Should I be expecting some minor withdrawals or major withdrawals? All I will have access to is Kratom and that is okay. I will be using that to make myself more comfortable and have some maintenance.

I am pretty high right now so sorry if this is hard to read. Just need some support and advice

I recently came across some ""gunpowder"" heroin, which is, from what I understand, dried out Black Tar Heroin (BTH).

I have never used gunpowder/tar heroin in my life, and am very curious as to how this is done. I know that I'm going to need to cook it until it dissolves, but I have no idea how long to cook it for, what to look for when cooking it, whether it will draw up into a syringe easily, etc.

If anyone has ever shot BTH / gunpowder heroin, would you kindly guide me through the process of how this is done? Purely hypothetically: let's say I wanted to do 0.2g of gunpowder/tar heroin. Obviously step #1 would be to add the heroin to the cooker, and step #2 would be to add the water to the cooker, but past that I truly don't know what to do.

How much heat is too much? How much water should I use for what amount? What should I be on the lookout for color/smell wise when I'm cooking it? Will the heroin easily suck up through the syringe? I want to make sure I'm doing this properly, and that I don't waste any product or fuck anything up.

—

tl;dr: Anyone with experience shooting gunpowder or tar heroin, would you be kind enough to give me the run-down on exactly how you prepare it for injection?

The purpose of this fire is to encode and propagate information for building more fires. You and I take long alkyl chains (fats), aldehydic polyols (sugars), and condensation polymers thereof (carbs) as fuel, combine it with oxygen, and convert it into water, carbon dioxide and energy, just like any other fire. Of course, this takes place in a well-regulated manner, as the energy is first relayed into the phosphorus-oxygen bonds of ATP and then gradually released as a combination of work and heat. But this fire also takes amino acid polymers (proteins), depolymerizes them, and reassembles the monomeric building blocks to build and maintain structures that perform calculations at petaflops speeds and act on these calculations to make the fire not only self-sustaining but also self-replenishing.  At some point, one fire can momentarily merge with another fire to start cute little fires whose purpose is to continue encoding and propagating information via complicated fires. Eventually, for any given flame, combustion slows down and dims until it flickers and then goes out permanently. This is sad but it’s the natural order of things, as inevitable as a candle’s wick being burnt down and becoming incapable of supporting further combustion. But it’s also amazing how easy it is to snuff out a flame prematurely, no matter how previously vigorous or vibrant (just cut off its supply of oxidant), and it’s always a tragedy when that flame is of the mind-blowingly complex variety described above.  Many of the flames on this sub have flickered and come dangerously close to going out forever. Be careful out there, y’all.  ",1552541235.0

I was 28 and living at home. Although to be fair, I had went to live on my own at 18, but when I had spinal surgery at 26 I moved home. It was super depressing. I was just using drugs and hiding in my bedroom, only really going out when I absolutely had to. It just wasn't a life, but everything was fine because I was on drugs. I justified it as being in pain and while that was true, I certainly didn't need the dose of narcotics that i was getting.

I started my journey to sobriety November 30th, 2017. I've had many relapses between then and now. Today I am 5 months clean. 150 days to be exact.

Since November 30th I've been clean for a total of 12 months out of the past 16 months since I started this journey. I know it doesn't work exactly that way, but it's nice to know I've spend the better half of a year and quarter clean. 

So, when I first got off of opiates in late November/early December, my parents were beyond thrilled. They ended up inviting my boyfriend & me for Christmas all expenses included. He was the first boyfriend of mine to be invited for Christmas. That was a big deal for my boyfriend and me.

In October 2018, my boyfriend proposed and became my fiance. I was beyond shocked. He was so nervous popping the question and like a dummy I said, ""ARE YOU SERIOUS!? OMG... OMG..."" then he asked for me answer and I starred at him because I was stunned, he goes, ""well...?"" and of course I said YES!

Then, I turned 30 clean. I don't know why but that was a big deal to me. Especially because I spent my 29th birthday withdrawing from drugs yet again while on vacation. No fun.

I sometimes like to gamble with small money. I do it on occasion and my limit is $100 when i can afford it. I ended up winning $10,000. I was making really reckless bets and it really paid off. I haven't gambled since. I walked away a winner and will stay that way.

The one thing that was holding me back was that I was in financial trouble. Being an addict did a number to my fiances and while my parents help support me because of severe physical and medical problems, it just wasn't enough. I guess it never is though. Since getting clean though, my father has been a lot more trusting with me and has been a lot more forgiving.

Speaking of finances, just last week i got a job. I've been looking for one like mad, but wasn't getting any luck. Finally, a friend of mine was leaving her company and needed to find a replacement. I got the job and am earning way more than what I would've settled for. This was a big change.

Best of all though, my health has been a lot better. I'm no longer going to the ER as much, I can't remember the last time I was hospitalized, so that is also amazing. Plus, I've had more energy and my pain score is hovers around a 5. It's not all that great, but, still much better than my common 8+ on the pain scale. Then, my anxiety has been well controlled. 

**TL;DR: My life dramatically changed when I got clean. I'm really excited about what's happened in 16 months and while I get urges to use, I know my life is so much better now.**",1552539029.0

I’m assuming it’s because I’ve been taking kratom and my tolerance is still “up”. Anyway I have 1.5 left and I would like to do it and study for school tonight. Would I be safe to go ahead and snort that with how much time has passed?

Edit: I feel dumb about the relapse but realize how great Kratom has been for me and how much I didn’t miss oxy like I thought I did. I’m going back to my kratom regimen tomorrow.",1552524709.0

Initially I was using once a month or less. Never had a craving or even a desire to use. If they popped up I’d use them occasionally but never thought I’d really care too much if I didn’t have access. 

Recently I’ve had more access to them and I didn’t notice that I started to use monthly and now weekly. The last couple of weeks have been 2x per week. I don’t consider myself having an issue (yet), although it is eye opening to see how it is slowly creeping up on me without me knowing until now. I’ve even considered using days in a row and didn’t spare a second thought to how it’s a very bad idea. My dosages have also increased a bit as well.

What I said would only be a one time thing has turned into a thing every time I get take homes. The clinic I to to refused to increase my dose when I told them I had withdrawal symptoms, so in my head I was just trying to get well and they forced my hand. Whether that is true is debatable, but there is even more to the story, including a nurse who no longer works there and her going against what the doctor ordered. Regardless, they would not allow me to go above 60mgs when I had an habit of 2 grams a day IV BTH.

  


Anyways, in the name of harm reduction, it is not safe to IV anything that is not made specifically for being IV'd. Now, I believe this is relatively safe with one brand of Methadone. VistaPharm's liquid oral Methadone solution 10mg per 1ml. All the ingredients in this solution can actually be found in other IV solutions of medications.

  


Now, using a regular syringe is out or the question due to how much liquid you are dealing with here. Most Walgreens carry the needle you need. The largest that they ALWAYS have in stock are 3cc 23g syringes. Draw up the liquid and bang that shot. There is no burning, and you get a rush that I honestly feel is just as good as a Black Tar rush. Normal daily oral doses of methadone won't give you any sort of feeling other than normal if you are on a stable dose. Before I did this I still felt sick every day. But this gives a warm high that really is a nice opiate buzz. I even find myself nodding

Has anyone else done liquid methadone via IV? Btw, I am unsure what is in other brands of liquid methadone, unless it is made by VistaPharm, do NOT attempt. Also, do not try this with methadone pills or wafers, its nearly impossible and unless you have a wheel filter, you shouldn't be IVing pills.

b0m0ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/b0m0ph/early_days/,15,https://redd.it/b0m0ph,realcat67,Early days,"  

I don’t do it much, but from time to time I think about how I got into all this. I was raised in the deep south and everything you have ever heard about rednecks, rebel yells, pickup trucks, guns and mamma tried is absolutely true, pc considerations be damned.

After I was introduced to the needle, I wisely decided I needed to make getting high a priority in my life. My friend Robert took me down to what passed for a hood in our neck of the woods. It was really just a little dirt road with a bunch of shacks running down for a couple of miles. 

After that first time, I decided I could handle it and there was no need to bother Robert. I remember going down to Barry’s house and knocking on the door. At least, I thought it was Barry’s house but it was really hard to tell because people were coming and going all the time and plus there was always a ton of kids that no one would tell you who they really belonged to.

So when somebody opened the door, I just said, Barry. And in a few, he would come out of some forbidden territory in the back. I would tell him what I wanted and he would tell me to wait. 

Then I would say, ok, I don’t mind standing out here in the rain that much, even if it is really muddy. But could you please hurry? Because I have to be at work in 15.

To which Barry would retort that this ain’t no goddam popeyes, bro and it takes as long as it takes cause dude be baggin up and shit. 

At that point in life, I had no idea what he was talking about, but I didn’t have much choice.

Ok, well, I’ll be right here.

I was super naive in those days and would stand there like an idiot, cold, miserable, waiting. Sometimes Barry would come back and sometimes he wouldn’t.

On those days that he did not return, I would knock on the door again and, eventually, someone would answer. 

I could never think of anything to say, other than to ask if Barry was there. I was inevitably told that he would be back in five minutes and I should wait. 

In the rain.

Eventually I would give up and trudge back to my car. Those were the early days.",1552483705.0

I got there and one of my friends gives me a 10mg Oxy. I think “fuck it, what’s the worst that could happen”. We smoked, I felt great. We went to a horse stable and had fun walking around town.

Later we stop at a store plaza to smoke again and my buddy again, gives me another pill, this time H, and I take it, and smoked again. Went into one of the pharmacies and bought food and drinks.

About an hour later, I’m sitting on the floor of some building that is closed, drooling, eyes wide, but I’m passed out. I literally feel like I’m dying. I felt like my life force was draining away out of my body. Idk that’s the only way I can describe what I felt that night.

I’m like this for 10minutes and then I sat up and started vomiting my brains out. My “friends” ran out of the building, leaving me there. Afterwards, I collapse face down in my own puke and start choking on it. 

About 30 seconds later some guy walks in and helps me up and asks if I need anything. I just ask him to drive me home(I didn’t have a car at the time) and this is some random guy that I didn’t know, potentially dangerous situation, right?

Anyways, this guy drops me off at my house, no bullshit, no nothing. I walk in the house, I’m snapping my fingers quickly and my brother calls my name from upstairs. I walk up and he just sighs and tells me to clean myself up and go to sleep

The next day I got suspended from school for stealing money for LSD.

(Btw my username used to be u/synthetic-happiness but now I can’t find the password or recovery info. I was fairly active on this subreddit.) 

I was taken by complete surprise - I was actually being pulled over going 48 
in a 40. (Kinda ridiculous, I was driving my Dads Tesla while he’s out of town and it showed I was going 42MPH at the time “apparently” radar’d me.) 

My guys wrap their dope multiple times, using trash bags, layering and layering them, so if you do swallow them, you don’t immediately have any concern. (Even though I was losing my shit.) 

Anyway, Cop does standard BS (I don’t even think or care about the ticket) so I start Google’ing while she runs my license - ‘how to throw up drugs.’ Nothing. ‘How to throw up bad things’ and that helped so much. 

It told me to drink a lot of soda and or salt water.  Tons of it. I had to drink two 16oz monsters, 7 12oz sodas, and then another 3 12oz sodas until I threw up - on top of all of that, my idiot brother told me to drink olive oil, which I had about 3/4th bottle of. I also had two cups of salt water. 

So I get home, with a ticket, and run upstairs to my bathroom to try and start throwing up. Fucking nothing. I hadn’t eaten for the day, so even when I pressed on my uvula a lot, I only got small amounts of stomach acid. 

That’s when the soda got involved. 

After 3/4th bottle olive oil, 2 12 oz cups of salt water, 2 16oz redbullls, and 7 12oz sodas, I throw up the first bag, a gram of coke. 

This gave me hope, and also helped me realize that I have more time. (The last bag was black tar). I didn’t stop though. 

I drank three more sodas immediately, and the black tar bag was 3.5g, and wrapped 11 times (it was huge) I knew it would be a challenge, and for a second, I thought about going to the emergency room. So I start looking up emergency rooms near me, find one, and immediately I have to throw up. 

This time I decided to put my finger into my esophagus, this helped a little bit, and lo & behold, a giant black plastic bag of dope comes to my esophagus - I was choking at this point, and my significantly smaller girlfriend gave me the Heimlich maneuver - POP - it came right out, onto our brand new carpet. 

I realized that if I would have held them in my sock... even my fucking pocket, I would have walked away with a ticket, but not a lethal dose of heroin in my body. 

Our guys just usually want to see that we have put it in our mouth before leaving the car for their safety. I have always gone with the flow and figured I could easily throw it up if I had to... how wrong I was. 

I feel like we think that it’s not going to be that hard, but to put it in perspective - my blood vessels by my eyes, and inside of my eyes burst while I was doing this. 

It was fucking terrifying and in the future I’m going to be extremely careful. I live in a very well-off city/gated community. 
My girlfriend thinks that the whole reason I got a ticket was because I was driving my Dads brand new Tesla is a less... affluent part of town. It doesn’t matter why, I’m not in jail or dead. 
That’s all I’m grateful for - well and the fact that I threw up my drugs successfully and didn’t have to have my girlfriend go pickup again while I go to the hospital to get them out. ",1552439383.0

I think they're being seized or something. I always order domestic but still, it's pretty nerve racking and weird considering it had all gone smoothly up till now.

So, my only new year's resolution was to find a connect in my city. A couple of weeks ago I hung around outside the needle exchange and asked a guy coming out to help me score. He was really helpful, took me to his dealer and I got a half teenth. Only problem was I never got to meet said dealer. Didn't get the middle's no. either (I gave him mine and he was supposed to txt me but never did).

So today I was rattling really bad and decided to try going to this dealer's place and seeing if I could score. I know, I know, turning up without an intro is sketch but I was desperate. Also, I'm a skinny mixed race girl who really doesn't look like a junkie lol and people probably think I'm a cop. So, I get to the guy's house, completely freaking out. Ring the door and explain that I'm a friend of D's and want to buy a half teenth. He invites me in, we head to the back room where some other junkies are chilling smoking h. There's drug paraphernalia EVERYWHERE. But, anyway, I get my half teenth and the dealer's number and skedaddle.

The kit was decent as well. So I've finally got a fucking plug and don't have to fuck around with that dw bullshit anymore!

I am a student doing research and would appreciate any answers you would care to give, regarding present or former drug use.","College student here working on a research assignment, and I thought it might be a good idea to look at one of the larger current crises in my country as well as globally. The war on drugs seemed like a topic that is significantly more nuanced then it is often portrayed, as such I felt it would be highly beneficial to hear about the impact it has had on those who have to face the impacts of the war firsthand almost every day.

* Which drugs were or do you have an addiction toward (legal or illegal) and which (reportedly addictive substances) did you, in your own experience, find non-addictive

Imagine a world in which all drugs were legal, there was a safe, and sanitary place to use/inject, access to less tainted drugs and less stigmatization (where society viewed addiction as a disease and not a personal fault).

* Do you think it would it be harder to hit rock bottom?
* Do you think you would have a better support net, (like be closer with your family)?
* Would it be easier for you to ask for help? Medical or otherwise

Redditors who have also been arrested on drug charges:

* How hard has it been to get a job afterwards or have people been understanding.
* How serious (or rather was it a misdemeanor or felony charge) was the offense.
* How long did you have to wait in jail prior to your trial.

I have created an offsite survey to help gain insights and understanding about the subjective experiences of people who have tried illegal drugs. I want to understand how addictive these drugs really are, the impact of the war on drugs and your thoughts about the impact of legalization.

The link to the survey can be accessed [here](https://goo.gl/forms/x3flkB3EOWL0xwK53).

My tongue also went slightly numb for a few minutes after. I then broke off about a fifth and crushed it up and snorted it, and within 30 seconds felt a warm rush - but not too euphoric. I think it was because I started to freak out because I knew I just took something that was not oxy.

The press is pretty decent (some could definitely pass as legit) but some of the pills are more obvious than others.

I had a short stint and am trying to detox. I have comfort meds sucks as kratom, my prescription for gabipentin and klonopin plus several hundred other klonopin and other benzos I have stock piled which I was just gonna try to detox using those, and am having a tough time. Someone suggested tapering off of it by using less and less heroin each day but I didn’t think that was really possible. Heroin has such a short half life and if you just use less and then less you just get sick. That’s the purpose of suboxone and methadone since they have longer half lives. I was just wondering if anyone has ever done that. 
To me that’s almost harder than trying to taper off xanax with xanax. It has such a short half life and no matter if you do to a detox or ask your Dr to taper you off of it 90% of the time they will switch you to a long acting benzo like klonopin or Valium since the half life is longer and if your on a high dose of xanax it’s hard to try to taper off of it with it itself because it wears off so quickly 
I have never heard of anyone tapering off of heroin with heroin
I have heard of a few people tapering off xanax with xanax but had a hell of a time and was usually on a low dose. Drugs like that with short half lives seem hard to taper off with the drug itself. But when I was on xanax at 6mg a day and tried to taper off it seemed impossible so I got switched to klonopin
Anytime I was very bad on heroin to the point of being really strung out I’ve always done methadone or suboxone 
But has anyone ever tapered off of heroin with heroin. I had a short run and am gonna detox and was just gonna use my variety of other non opiate meds to do it but someone suggested to just use less and less each day, this person was not very experienced in heroin and did it a hear or two a few years ago and is doing it on and off now and I don’t think is very knowledgeable about half lives and things like that so he’s not a very experienced person but It still makes me wonder which I don’t think would work cause eventually you’d just get sick and it seems like it would drag it out more

After that I tried boofing it and it was very underwhelming compared to just eating the powder coincidentally. I tried boofing/plugging  multiple times because it seems to be the best method of delivery aside from IV.  I tried letting the powder mixed in water sit in my oral syringe over night thinking it would get around any other ER that wasn’t defeated and yet again didn’t match up to just eating the chopped up powder.

- My most recent attempt has been my most successful thus far. I did the procedure listed above but instead of mixing the powder with water I mixed it with a small amount of the Bang energy drink. I mixed the solution couple times throughout the night and then went to bed. Woke up this morning and drank the solution and noticed a VERY FAST onset. It took no more than 5 minutes to feel affects and was quite enjoyable.

- Now I’m very interested in trying this same process but in my booty hole. I don’t think putting bang in my butt should be much of a concern. What do you guys think? Any concerns, comments or questions are welcomed! Sorry if this was hard to read lol I’ve been nodding.

So about 4 or 5 years ago I started with codeine and then hydros upon finally settling at oxy as my permanent opiate lol. I started with 15mg, But over the past couple years, I've been steady at 20mg to fuck me up pretty good. 

&#x200B;

Well a few months ago I said fuck it and took 30mg. WOW. I was actually nodding out, I was in heaven. That was crazy! My friends said they were actually a little worried about me that night because I looked so fucked up lol. But I kept taking 20mg for that week and it was alright.

&#x200B;

So now I'm back home and I've taken 20mg for the past two nights. I get high and feeling good, don't get me wrong, but I don't get that overwhelming ""holy fuck im in heaven"" feeling. Even though I haven't touched opiates since early January, is it possible that I've become used to 20mg and I should start doing 30mg for recreational purposes? P.S., There's are Perc10's, so I can't really even take more than 30mg without doing a CWE or something.   


All in all, does tolerance build even though I take multiple month breaks between my periodic 3-5 day binges? Or is it all in my head?",1552339707.0

Works amazingly for people with high tolerances.,"So if you see my posts once in awile, you might know l make my H money thru selling and middle manning any drugs in demand in general. Last week I made enough money to buy a few grams of the put of this world dope. I only do like .3 of really good dope a day. So when this shit ran out and only made a few small wales while having it...I ran dry. 

This was about 40 hours ago since my last dose. Not gonna write this up for the 100th time, so ill just let you know I felt like hell. Today, less then an hour ago I finally did a small middle man. Just got home 20 mins ago or so and did my normal sized shot. And oh fucking man, normally a ahot this size just gives me a nice lil high but this time I felt like I might fucking drop. Literally only 40 hours since last dose and it seems 3x as strong.

Tldr. If your not getting very much out of your dope or oxy amount you normally do then take a couple day T break. Just a few days works wonders.

Also, if you so only 2 says like me, your tolerance will come right back in few days. So either lowering your dose after the T break, or take a couple week break to really destroy your tolerance.",1552336311.0

Help me figure this out please?","THIS IS AN EDIT ADDITION: THE SHOT IN QUESTION WAS ALSO NOT FILTERED, I AM JUST REMEMBERING THIS AND ITS CAUSED ME TO WORRY A GREAT DEAL MORE. MY DOPE NEVER NEEDS A FILTER TO SUCK UP, BUT I STILL ALMOST ALWAYS USE ONE. THIS JUST HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THOSE TIMES I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IN REACH, WAS SLEEPY, AND SUCKED UP THE SHOT WITHOUT USING ANY SORT OF FILTRATION METHOD. I AM HOPING THAT THE 3 SECONDS OF TIME I SAVED BY NOT WALKING AND GRABBING A Q TIP IS NOT THE ENTIRE REASON I AM IN THIS PREDICAMENT. ONCE AGAIN; I AM DUMB WHEN PERTAINING TO THE LEVEL OF CAUTION EXERCISED WHEN THE ONLY THING AT RISK IS MY OWN PERSONAL WELL BEING, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT ISSUE IN ITSELF.

&#x200B;

Ok, to start off I am very dumb and tend to think I'm relatively invincible. I am a fairly regular IV drug user so you can imagine how well those two things go together. I purely need advice on how I should best handle, control and fix this situation, or really to know if this is even a situation at all to begin with.

&#x200B;

So sometime last night in the wee hours of the morning, I was fixing to do a shot, and was struggling to register. I had sleepy eyes, was still high from before, and things were just not going well. My shot got to the point it was more blood than precious nectar, and the only way I could tell if I was registered was if the empty space created by the vacuum filled up with more blood. I thought I had registered, and I pushed what had become a nasty little concoction of blood and once nice and clean heroin nectar. I was met with little to no resistance, and did not feel any sort of burning sensation at the time of administration.

&#x200B;

This is where things go wrong. I don't get a rush like usual, meaning fuck, I've most likely missed. Whatever itll seep in slower and maybe keep me asleep longer. Well after a short amount of time my arm just feels overall bad, not normal but not like painful yet. Hard to describe. Went to sleep and woke up maybe 4 hours later. Now, about 12 hours from the time of the fateful shot, and about 8 hours since I woke up, I am experiencing a great deal of pain in the arm, it seems to specifically be in the upper portion of my arm. Above the elbow, and in the bicep area. Pain is increased with touch, if i squeeze the area. Increase in pain with movement of arm, straightening at the elbow, rotating the arm in the way that if held straight out with palm facing down, counter-clockwise rotation would make the palm face up. This last rotation movement just described seems to be the most painful one.

&#x200B;

I do think the level of pain, frequency and intensity of pain does seem to be worsening as the day goes on. When waking up it was simply a nuisance, it is becoming somewhat debilitating. Please help me figure out exactly what is going on here. There is NO visible mark, redness, swelling, anything. Absolutely NO VISIBLE aspect in anyway shape or form. The most painful area of the arm if on the inside, the palm side, right above the inside of the elbow, almost right at the start of the bicep, where it looks like the bicep would connect and begin. I will include a picture if requested, but there really doesn't seem to be anything that I'm able to notice that is out of the ordinary from a visual standpoint.

&#x200B;

Any and all help, suggestions, and even scolding will be read and appreciated. It is really starting to bother me, hence why I'm making this post. I would say the pain level is at the point where it is right in between causing enough concern to make an extremely detailed post asking for any kind of help, rather desperately, and then actually going to the ER. So it hurts pretty bad and if it continues to worsen and hurt much more I think the ER will be needed. Hopefully that can provide a decent explanation of how intense the pain being experienced is. Also, I would describe the pain as a somewhat sharp and acute aching sensation. It is not burning, and not exactly stabbing. But more of a sharp ache.

&#x200B;

Even wild guesses are appreciated and reviewed at this point. Please provide me with the level of risk I may be at, in terms of losing my limb or something wild, and just overall health in general. No numbness, pretty much full motion despite the increase in the sharp aching pain in the rather acute location previously described.",1552336198.0

That low dose is enough to get rid of most of my issues for a few hours, and makes me enjoy life again while under the influence of the drug.

&#x200B;

How sustainable is a habit like this, let's say, if I take 1 day on the drug, and 2 days off?

&#x200B;

I assume tolerance will still slowly build, but theoretically I shouldn't get physically dependent, and possible not even psychologically dependent, right?

Can somebody have a high tolerance to a substance without having used it prioir?

For clarification, i use opiates recreationally, maybe a weekend binge every other month or so, nothing too major. Although i have found that any type of Hydrocodone will get me feeling pretty good at the 15/20mg point (w/ zero tolerance) but Oxycodone takes 30/40mg to get me feeling the same as 15/20mg of Hydro. Additionally i have tried Codien pills and liquid (lean) and it has had zero effect at all on me. Please note also that i am not a very big guy. (about 5’10, 130lb)

Is it possible to naturally have a high tollerance or immunity to specific classes of opioids?

One time he shot a dose, sort of fell out, and when I shook him to come to, he looked at me all wide-eyed saying he couldn't hear anything and that his ears were ringing.

Now today he says he did his normal shot, got a great rush, then after that his ears rang for a minute or so. 

What could be the cause of this tinnitus? I have never experienced it, and use the same dope, shooting it as well. There is no cocaine involved, this I know because I use the same dope, so that certainly isn't the answer. 

Does this sound familiar to anyone? My best guess is some weird reaction to a cut. The first time it happened  to him I thought it must have been some neurovascular thing from falling out and maybe O2 deprivation... but him saying he experienced it a separate time after the rush and not falling out makes me wonder what the fuck is going on.

Anyone have any idea what might be happening here? ",1552300611.0

The strips are 100% IVable, in fact I imagine they are safer to IV because there is thousands of times less fillers and insoluble garbage with the strips.

None of us had narcan, but we were only about 15 minutes away from the needle exchange where we could get some free narcan. So I tell the driver to head there and I start giving my friend CPR. This was one of the scariest moments of my life but I wasnt going to do nothing and just let my friend die. So we get off the interstate and start driving into town towards the needle exchange and I notice we were being followed. Suddenly we start to hear sirens off in the distance getting closer. The people following us saw me giving my friend CPR through the back window and called the police. So we are literally right In front of the needle exchange when the cops get behind us so we pulled over and all of a sudden thank God my friend comes to and starts breathing again. Unfortunately everyone in the car except for my friend that stopped breathing had warrants so we all went to jail except for him. But I just wanted to share this story on here because i have nobody really in my life i can talk to about this stuff as I hafta hide my use from all my loved ones and this is the first time I've been able to tell this story to anybody.

If I couldn’t get clean, I had to make some kind of move. To me, it felt like being locked down on a life sentence with no hope of parole. If something did not change, there really was no point in sticking around.

I think people are reborn multiple times in life. First you go from 16 to twenty, when you become a for real adult and are amazed that everyone now thinks you should be responsible.

Then there is 22 to 35, when you are getting that nagging feeling that you should be doing doing doing something with your life. You should be having kids and getting a house. Actual stuff adults do.

Then there are forties, and you realize you are starting to get old. That is not acceptable so it is time to buy that Porsche and prove you could still fight in the ufc. Which you cannot. The future is now, old man.

Anyway, I missed a lot of these life changes because, I wanted my dope. Imo when you are on dope, you are sort of in stasis and don’t change that much, except to get desperate.

Unless you are just fucking crazy, you start to realize you are locked into a relationship that you cannot escape from. You are going to get fucked and you are not gonna enjoy it.

Maybe for years.

That was the hard part for me. One strange part of my experience was that, at the end, I had a lot of spare money and could buy as much dope as I wanted. So in a way, that was even worse, because I really could not even look forward to my little copping chills and thrills. I already  had my h. Quite a bit of it.

So now, I keep doing my h and I do not enjoy it at all. I am already as numb as possible and more does not mean better. I try to quit, fail, repeat. Everybody hates me. Don’t call me, I’ll call you, next year, maybe.

Every single thing that makes life cool is long gone. Friends, music, girls, drama (except for junkie drama, doesn’t qualify) family, adrenaline rushes, all gone.

I mean, if I got my shit together, maybe I could have bought a Harley or something, but I wouldn’t have enjoyed it. I didn’t enjoy anything.

Thus, better off dead.

I decided I had to try quitting again. But this time, it was different because I had no reservations about going back. It took me a few months to really start feeling good and to start dealing with life.

I try hard. I pick up that guitar. I smile at that girl. I do that training. I do anything other than get bored, because a bored me is a dangerous me. I even do things with my in-laws sometimes, which is above and beyond. But no price is too high to pay. I'm sayin, consider the alternative. Fuck that noise.",1552272750.0

Here is the situation: my girlfriend is German so i live here at the moment. I speak very little Deutsch. My girlfriend's mother is an hardcore junkie for like 12 years or more. I'm not sure. Well, we just found out that she decided to switch from Heroin to Subutex because maybe it's cheaper or something, and she buys it on the streets.

We dont know if she know's any trusted dealer or if she buys it randomly. She just ran away today from the ""Junkie Help Center"" or something and doesn't want any Methadone anymore because she says that it doesn't give her the nod she wants. So, my question is: is there any (legal) way to buy an opiates test kit in Germany? Does Germany have some kind of ""free heroin program""? 

I also need to ask you professional junkies/dealers if the Subutex is cutted with Fent around here. I asked all this to my girlfriend first but she is crying for 3 hours now and she doesnt even reply to me. I don't know what to do. I'm not an H user and neither is my girl. She is also dealing with addiction but it's from other drugs. I struggle with alcoholism so i don't know anything about H or opiates in general.

She is afraid that her mother will die soon.

I think it'll pass just fine.

What I'm more so worried about is if I'm going to get stopped for bringing a couple rigs on the plane, not to mention a cooker or would a spoon be less inconspicuous? Or should I suck it up and just snort them instead? No, I'm not sticking them up my ass but thanks for being about to suggest it.

I'm so unbelievably touched by the kind words and the support. I want to be able to respond to everyone and I will do my best but if it takes me a bit of time, please don't think your replies didn't touch me.  Those of you who shared your stories - thank you.  Those of you who don't think you deserve love - YOU DO!  Those of you who think you are worthless - TO SOMEONE YOU ARE WORTH EVERYTHING!  

I posted this in r/heroin and was asked to crosspost to here.  Crossposting doesn't seem to be allowed - so here it is as a new post.

Long post: An honest account of what it's really like to love a heroin addict.

As a nurse I have had the honor of working with some of the most caring, empathetic amazing nurses, and yet, I still hear things that break my heart. ""Junkie"" ""Loser"" ""Scum bag"" ""just OD and get it over with"" ""Asshole""....foul, horrible things that in no way reflect the person they are talking about, but instead reflect the way society sees an addict. Sure there are addicts that are ""losers"" or ""assholes"" but there are also doctors, teachers, athletes and countless others who are ""losers"" and ""assholes"". Being an addict makes you an addict; being an ""asshole"" makes you an ""asshole"". The two are in no way related.

I have met my fair share of addicts who fall into the category of ""asshole"", but in my career I have met far more who were sweet and kind and funny. And I fell in love with one of them.

I knew who and what Michael was from day one. He was funny, bright, silly, beautiful, and ridiculous at times and he was a heroin addict. And he was the bravest risk I have ever taken, and one I have never regretted.

Michael was sober when he moved in with me. He was excited about his sobriety and about being a part of a family. In fact, he used the word ""family"" so frequently it was like he was afraid it would one day disappear and he had to use it as much as possible before it was gone. It was his favorite word.

Michael and I had a deal - nothing about his addiction could be a secret. It was probably the most honest part of our relationship. He hid nothing from me. Not the times he wanted to use but didn't, and not the times he wanted to use and did. There was not an aspect of his addiction he hid from me. He shared it all; things I won't share here. And here is what I know...

Michael loved heroin. His exact words were ""I fucking love heroin"". He loved the way it made him feel (or not feel). He loved the escape it afforded him. It was his way of coping with not only the horrors of Afghanistan that haunted him, it was his way of coping with a lot of other personal issues that were just too hard for him to face any other way.

Michael loved heroin but he hated what it cost him. He hated that he hurt the people he loved with his addiction. He hated not being a part of his son's life. He hated the disappointment he knew he caused. He hated that it made him a hypocrite telling Sam that he would kill him if he ever found out he touched a drug, and then getting high behind a closed door. He hated himself for being ""weak"", for needing heroin to face life. He hated the lies it made him tell....the sneaking and secrets he kept from everyone but me. He hated what I saw, the things I learned because of him. He was ashamed of his addiction; he loved the drug but hated the man it made him.

There is a panic in loving an addict. Sometimes it's a quiet panic and other times it's as loud as a freight train. It's constant worry. Would today be a good day? Would it be a bad one? Michael used for all sorts of reason. A bad day at work. A fight with his father. A reward for being ""good"" for several days in a row. There was never any rhyme or reason behind it. There were bad days were I was sure he would come to me and tell me he wanted to get high but he didn't. And there were great days where I was shocked when he told me he wanted to use. I could never be sure what would trigger it.

So what's it like to love an addict? It's terror. It's keeping Narcan in your house and in your car. It's seeing the man you love turn greyish blue from lack of oxygen and breathing for him to keep the oxygen flowing. It's being afraid all the time. It's worrying every time you are apart that you'll never see him alive again. It's knowing that you can try and get them help; that you can plead and beg and bargain, but that you cannot make an addict get sober. Ultimatums do not work because unless an addict is ready to get sober they will chose the drug over the person giving them the ultimatum. It’s not being able to tell anyone, because telling won’t make them sober, but it could make them leave and then who would keep them safe? It’s being able to separate the man from his addiction in your head and in your heart, because he is so much more than just an addict. It's choosing between loving the whole man, addiction and all, sober and high, or walking away. It’s knowing, deep in your soul, that every day is a blessing, because with an addict the next day is not for sure. It’s also knowing that no matter how many days sober they have, that no matter how hard they try, that no matter how much you love them, that losing them to an overdose is almost a guarantee.

I love Michael. I love him for who he was in the most honest way possible. I knew all of the good and bad parts of him and it changed nothing. To me, he wasn’t an addict. He was just Michael. He wasn’t a “junkie” or a “loser” or an “asshole”. He was one of the best people I have ever had the honor to know and I miss him every single day. But even in my heartache – even with the immense pain his death as caused – even with the constant ache of missing him – I wouldn’t trade one single minute, good and bad, I shared with him.

If you have gotten this far - If you have read all the way to the end - I hope the next time you talk about an addict that you choose your words carefully. That you remember to separate the person (who could be an asshole) from their addiction. I hope you remember that that person you are calling a ""junkie"" is someone's son or daughter, that they are the love of someone's life, that they are somone's friend or brother or sister. I hope you look a little deeper and see the person for who they really are - and not just for the one thing that absolutely does not define them. Because I can honestly tell you that if I were to make a list of who Michael was, heroin addict would be far far down the list.",1552259804.0

Today I'm in the bathroom of my parents house as they all eat Sunday dinner. I'm hungry but not for the pot roast and potatoes on the table. Instead I follow my steps, prep my shot of Heroin and gently insert heaven into my blood. 


“Ahhhh. Oh shiiiiiiittttt…” My eyes roll back, right before my head hits the floor.


Blackness engulfs me until I wake. Still in the bathroom, but now I'm standing? How am I standing? On the counter sits one Roxi 30 a serving spoon and a needle?


How? Why? What? All these questions race through my mind. I know how to fix this though, meticulously I crush the pill, add water, and pull it up. I have to take my shoelace out to tie off, as my normal tie isn't in my pocket. Shaking I guide the needle into left AC. 


“Just like the first time” I think to myself as blood fills the chamber and I press the plunger. Before leaving the bathroom I lick the spoon swallowing the cotton. 


Oxy isn't as quick as H to hit you even when you shoot it, but it still hits like freight train of bliss. 


I walk into the kitchen to wash off the spoon. The spoon clattering in the sink sounds like a slap.


“Why does my face feel funny?”



Instantly it was back on the ground next to a puddle of puke. I heard my mother crying as my father slapped me awake, dragging me to the shower. The door is busted in, the floor was littered with a spoon, 5 empty stamps, a spoon, and a needle. 


“Call 911!” my dad bellows, drenching me in ice cold water. 


“I... I'm sorry” I stammer and slur out the words.



Two years and three institutionalizations later, I still hear the cries of my mother echo in my mind.

I like to see the pictures of hauls I guess. I know these drugs exist, and there’s not a week that goes by where I don’t think about them at least once. I’ve never had an under-the-table opiate habit or a scrip for some lasting more than a few days.

I guess I’m more of a special case. For a full decade of my life, I would have episodes of extreme pain from a chronic issue I had, which is sometimes compared to the pain of giving birth. I’d believe it. So I was given opiates; dilaudid, Demerol,morphine, while hospitalized. This would occur for 5 day segments once every few months, for 10 full years. Always through an IV. 

Whenever I’m in pain now, physical or emotional. My mind wanders back to those experiences, the numbing, the euphoria, the shield between me and my troubles, the rush as your entire body tenses up before giving way to the most relaxing sensation in the world. 

I was prescribed a few narcos for (unrelated) pain recently, and they reminded me of how good it can feel.

I guess my point is, even when you do everything right and make no effort to introduce it into your life, even when your dealer wears a lab coat,  this shit sinks its claws in you. Even years later you still feel it’s tug

I don’t think I’ll ever start a habit, maybe this sub’s feeding into it, or maybe reading the negative stories keeps me away. I know this probably isn’t news to anyone here, but it’s scary that this part of me exists, and I guess I wanted to get it out in a non-judgemental space.",1552200653.0

And I feel like that that's just part of life when you live in a capitalistic Society which right now I feel like it's as good as it gets of course that's not to say it can't be improved and that it isn't being improved but I really feel like it's as good as it gets. But that's something that we has Americans don't think about has a whole too much is that in this country we inherently have the right to be informed. Now I I don't think that necessarily mean you will be informed. I feel like we have to do the leg work. Since the Advent of the internet there's been a lot harder war of information you have to siphon through disinformation and misinformation to find it.  basically,  if you want to be informed of a subject a lot of people are talking about it today. I also feel like that as Americans we have the right to choose which is something that other people in countries don't necessarily get to the scope that we do.  I just feel like that's the duality of a Democratic Society the fact that you are going to have things products push up on you because it's a capitalistic Society but that if you want to find out the truth about something, whether you need it or not, would it be good for you.  you have the right to be informed and make that choice. There is a war to control the information you get and the decisions you make on a daily basis but I feel like thank God I live in America which at its core,  although it may not seem like it sometimes, encourages get yourself informed and make a decision based on the information that you receive. Something else I feel as Americans is it's our duty to be informed and it's our duty to make the best decision for ourselves, that's how a democracy evolves,  because the man ain't going to do it for us. I know the man sounds cliche but mankind has been fighting the man since the dawn of time. I think that's something that all human beings have in common is being under the thumb of the man , whether we realize it or not. It's like the powers-that-be fight to get you to give up the right of being informed and making decisions but if you focus your willpower into learning what's right and wrong for you in life and making the decision that's best for the life you want to live you can get it in this country.  it's not easy and the man ain't going to make it any easier but it can be done. I was watching the podcast that was talking about censorship of the internet and how the internet is inherently metastasizing against censorship and that when the government finds one way to censor the internet will always find a way around it.  I believe that too and I believe with every bout of censorship that we have more people will want the right to be informed, and to make better decisions for themselves, because it's easy to tell a liar after you've been around one long enough,  and with the access of information speeding up so much with the Advent of technology and the internet the rate at which people learn to be informed and make decisions for themselves is increasing exponentially.

Smoked a lot of pot and drank a lot of vodka at the time too. In college I got into psychedelics, bars, addies, you name it 

I’m no model, but I’d say I’m a conventionally attractive female— I look like I’ve never touched a drug. 
So when I started smoking crysTal at 21, nobody knew. I was the only girl in my friend circle— the rest were these flamboyant gay guys and one of them introduced me to T. (There’s a dark corner of the gay communiy where drugs are prevalent.) We partied every night of the week for a year. Good shit. 

I always hated the effects of H, but when my friends gave me some, I fell in love this time. I’m a good massage therapist, but I was even better at junkie. 
My life turned upside down after about a year on H. I was spending so much fuckin money. My rough calculation for one year is $20k-30k and that’s probably low balling it...
In the 24 hours before I got help, I’d used $600 worth of quality china white. I did the 30 day rehab and then the NA shit. 

I relapsed after 100 days and did the whole process over again. Way worse the 2nd time. I get my vivitrol shot now and have been sober for 5 months. It’s all physically and mentally painful, but I am alive

i always thought of drugs like methadone and buprenorphine as 'worse than heroin' since they last longer and you hear all these horror stories about how its just trading addiction

i went to a clinic a few months ago and got prescribed buprenorphine (just had to sign up, my script costs like 8 pounds a month), i dont need to use heroin at all since it masks the withdrawals-- nor do i have any real urge to use. i take 4mg a day (compared to smoking up to a gram a day just to feel normal) and im not kidding myself that im 'sober'-- im on an opiod and realize that. Only now i can live a normal life, im no longer spending my youth laying in bed unconscious or withdrawing... i barely managed to stay afloat in university while using, but i should now be on track for a high (enough) grade overall. I also workout again, and have gained back alot of my muscle (i was a bodybuilder before i was a junkie-- the bupe also does enough to mask my back pain that was usually my excuse to relapse)

before going to the clinic i had tryed to wean myself off heroin a few times using buprenorphine, tapered over a week or so-- the withdrawals were much more bearable. though id just end up relapsing like aways... so here i am xD

I hear a lotta people talk about how after getting addicted to opiates you stop liking weed, which is true for me too. But why is this? For me it’s because ever since opiate addiction started for me weed makes me overthink so much. It’s also the fact that I’m a drug addict that makes my high a lot less enjoyable because I find myself overthinking it and getting lost in my thoughts about the fact that I’m a  heroin addict. And this whole thing just makes me very anxious and sad. Weed also makes me see the bad side of everything.

So did you stop liking weed (if you did beforehand) after getting addicted to opiates? If so what is different about weed now that makes you not like it?

My friend explained that these dreams are interpreted as using the opiates because your brain is kickstarting the receptors and repairing them- thus anything released by those receptors that the opiates once mimicked and burned out, are manifesting themselves in dreams of using as they serve similar functions.  

At face value, I thought this was intriguing and maybe possible.  Is there any truth to my friend’s claims?  I’m still a little skeptical...but even if this becomes an exercise in placebo, I suppose it could be beneficial as when a dependent has a dream, they could interpret it as healing rather than a calling to relapse that they should give into. 

TL;DR a friend says opiate using dreams after quitting are the brain healing and producing the chemicals that opiates initially replaced. The dreams are a sign of healing. True?",1552161346.0

I hope what is by and large a very mild romance with oxy may serve as a cautionary story to anyone who, like me until yesterday, thought doing oxy was no big deal. Bits of my story might sound familiar as I did post here sometimes when I was convincing myself that what I was doing was okay. 

“I always said I’d never touch opiates. I’ve had family friends, friends parents, etc die from them over the years. I never understood the appeal of nodding out, or how someone could trick themselves into thinking they wouldn’t get addicted. 

Then about two weeks ago, I ran out of weed. Yes, running out of weed mentally gave me the go ahead to start taking oxy. Because I didn’t take it as seriously as I should have and now I’m paying for it. What’s the big deal, I told myself. How much can a tiny little pill change your life? Obviously everyone else was making out to be a much bigger deal than it was. Luckily for me though, I don’t have a dealer, and my supply is limited and I don’t have regular access. 

What started as 7.5mg of oxy the first time I tried it has turned into 25-35mg within under two weeks trying to chase that high. According to everyone those are low doses, but I am already feeling the damage I’ve done to myself, mostly psychologically as far as I can tell. Terrified I’m going to go to sleep one night and never wake up, leading me to deprive myself of sleep. 

Yesterday I successfully took only 15mg of oxy. I have a feeling I know what most people might say about tapering, but I think it’s the best way to ease myself out while I’m not in too deep. Today I’m only taking 10mg. I don’t even want to. I don’t even want to be high. Honestly, it wasn’t even ever a fun high to me, it wasn’t ever really enjoyable it was just... nothingness. 

I’m sick of scheduling my day or lack thereof at this point around a fucking pill I don’t even enjoy at this point. No one knows I’ve been taking it, no one knows anything about my habit. I can’t believe I did this to myself, especially the profound ignorance in the reason I started and the lies I told myself. Not even two weeks and I might have just lost a really good job opportunity because I can’t function right now. 

I can’t even differentiate between what’s potentially real withdrawal and what’s my mind making it up. I swear so much in my sleep last night, keep having hot flashes, I just feel like shit. I’m more sad now than going through anything physical. 

I just want out. “

Everyone can downvote all they want, I expect that. I wrote that when I was so panicked and hysterical I could barely breathe— I know my withdrawal is psychological, not physical. My point of this post is to show anyone thinking of trying it how bad you can fuck yourself up psychologically in a short span on time on a low dose of oxy. The absolute hysteria I have catapulted myself into at my own volition. And this isn’t even the tip of the iceberg. I can’t even see the tip from where I am. This is only the beginning if I kept going. ",1552158882.0

Alright, so I go into this rehab place about 2 days after this guy came in. There's 3 characters in this story. Me, D (the heroin fella and roommate), and M (my other roommate.

We were in rooms with 4 beds each, all of them occupied at the time including me.

I was the youngest person there, really still a kid at the time, everyone else was 22-48 so it was difficult to talk to people. D talked to me like he was already my friend, he seemed nice. But everything got weird quickly. I saw D and a some other guy (from another room) going out the emergency exit door a few times, and one of these times D grabs something from M's drawer when he wasn't there. I don't care at first. Maybe M doesn't mind D going in his drawers? D kept saying things along the lines of ""you don't wanna get stuck up in this room, you should try to go make some friends"". Seemed nice, but I'm sure he just wanted me to leave so he could do something.

Alright, so let's get to the good shit. One night he was clipping his toenails way past lights-out time. It took him about 20 minutes to finish. I'm not sure if he was high as fuck or what. Another night I wake up to piss and he's in the dark just hunched over the desk snorting lines of.... Something? He doesn't realize I'm up until I'm right next to him and he freaks the fuck out. But I just walk right past him and go piss and come back to sleep. 

Well a few days pass and he fails a drug test so he's kicked out. M has been a great friend of mine for the past couple of days, and it seems now like he's talking trash about D, so he must not like him. So I ask M ""did you let D go in your drawers? cause D did that a while ago"". The answer was something along the lines of ""oh shit, no I don't, why?""

We tell the administrators and they go search the room. They find a turkey baster attached to a horse syringe needle and it was filled with dope and blood. Seriously it was huge. It probably would've held an ounce of liquid or more.

We're not sure if they had some sort of massive tolerance or if their plan was to just cook up once and shoot up just a little bit at a time while hiding the half-full needle in M's drawers. It made sense to me cause cooking up every day is risky. (ideas on exactly what they were doing would be appreciated) So not only did they do this, but they stole the horse syringe, a spoon, a turkey baster, a lighter from the shop house, and probably some other stuff just to do it.
 

And of course, to top it all off, they both got Hepatitis from the needle. 


tl;dr 

roommate hid heroin in another roommate's drawers without consent. he built a rig out of a massive turkey baster and a needle from a horse syringe (or maybe the whole thing was just a horse syringe, idk). I scared the shit out of him while he was sniffing lines at midnight.


Edit: looks like it was probably just a simple horse syringe. either the first or second largest in this picture are both accurate representations of what I saw, except they had a needle on it. https://ii.bigdweb.com/fcgi-bin/iipsrv.fcgi?FIF=/images/bigdweb/source/130-9.tif&wid=400=&cvt=jpeg",1552153090.0

My mum got fired a while back for taking prescription painkillers for pain in her shoulder and being visibly affected by them on the job, IDK how they noticed that she'd taken them, she just said that they found out about it and had to let her go. She got them from a friend, they were not on her prescription.

I've noticed that she sometimes acts weird, a bit like a different person at times. I thought that she might be bipolar type 2 and that what I saw was hypomania.

She has wounds here and there from itching and she's been complaining about pain in her back and shoulder for a while (she's just very sickly in general, her body is not doing too well).

Goes on for 1-4 days

She CONSTANTLY makes sounds, like humming on sounds, snorting sound (outwards, not inwards like snoring)

seems a bit disoriented and confused but certain that nothing is wrong when I confront her

Always seems to be ""on a mission"", like she's gonna do something, but she doesn't have to do something she just acts as if she has stuff to do, like walking around, picking stuff up and moving them etc.

One I remember is when my mom first saw needle marks on my arm. She grabbed my wrist , looked, and started crying. 

That blew me away, because never had I ever seen my mother cry.

I remember thinking, if I wasn’t a junkie before, I sure am now.

Things didn't go well after that. I became a little heroin punk, hanging out in clubs and pretending I was a real adult, which I definitely was not. 

Later, when I was older, I no longer had time for that. Because I had to hustle up the money to go cop and I had to get there before the police changed shift at 7:30 am. That was always fun, because I would get up sick and if it took me even 30 minutes longer than planned, things were going to get really real. 

I wish I could have quit because my family wanted me to.

I wish I could have quit for my friends. These were guys I absolutely loved and they were not gonna tolerate me shooting dope. We had a long tradition of hanging out, doing whatever drugs we could get our hands on (but not heroin) getting stupid drunk and dancing like idiots and just generally be young guys. So I lost them a long time ago.

Then there was the subject of relationships. I was interested in a disinterested sort of way. I would meet someone from time to time, and we might chat and there might be a spark or two, but in the end, it just was not worth it. Sort of like if I was a paraplegic and other people were running marathons. Why get involved? For what reason? It was not gonna end well.

I wasted so much time with dope. There is no other word for it. 

I really thought I needed heroin and that it was the only thing for me. I wanted it worse than I ever wanted anything else, and I did extraordinary things to get it. 

The thing was, it was all bullshit. Somehow, the dope wormed its way into my head and convinced me that I could only be happy when I was doing a shot. And that was kind of true, for maybe a year. It was not so much that I was happy as it was that I was feeling no pain.

It literally muted life for me. It flipped that switch to the OFF position. And the longer I did dope, the longer life needed to be muted. I so looked forward to getting that fire shot. Then I would do it, and I would be feelin it, but it just was not right. My problems were not going away anymore. 

And if you can’t trust your dope to make your problems go away, who can you trust?

Sadly, I am the only one who can make my problems go away. And the only way to do that was to get clean. Damn. Who saw that coming?

One day, enough was enough and I was stopping right the fuck now. No more bullshit excuses. Yes, it is going to hurt. You can do it.

It did hurt. Really bad. And what I realized was that I was never going to be strong enough to handle opiates. They were always going to win and the only way to not lose was to not fight.

I read opiates can cause these Myoclonic seizures. Which makes sense since the cause of them are because your nervous system isn't working the way it should. Something makes your nerve cells misfire and send the wrong signal to your muscles.

So when we do drugs like opiates it sends a flood of dopamine in our brains, right? So when the drugs are done, and we go thru withdrawals, it's because of the lack of enough dopamine and/or serotonin, correct? 

So the depression, anxiety etc. Is due to low serotonin from our body's not being able to make enough of its own because it's used to the opiates creating it 

So let's say if every time we did drugs and it flooded our brains with dopamine. After the high is all said and done and our brains werent so depleted of its own serotonin, would be still go thru withdrawals or get addicted?

Is he in danger? Will these medications interact?

I just discovered TODAY that his taking both, and this (tramadol whole day + alprazolam to sleep) has been going for like 2 weeks. Until now he's ok, some difficult to breathe, but that may be the tumor.

im struggling to not transfer cash from my savings to get more dope...i have a nice amount saved up and i am struggling to not give in an dip into it....

im turning 40 next month and want to be done with this endless ratrace and makin my dealer rich ....but the mental addiction and temptation is waaaay to much and i find myself on autopilot to go and cop....i chip so i cop maybe twice a week...spending about 400+ on dope every month...using half to a gram on each run...snorting

ive never had physical withdrawals but my anxiety get fucked when i dont have dope...im irritable and hate life and find no pleasure in doing things while not on dope.

I cant get it off my mind...and i really need to let this shit go...im tired of hiding it from my wife and my daughter is almost 6 months old...my goal is to be done by april 1st..

am i a complete shitbag if i dip into the saving and cop?  i want to delete my plugs number but i cant imagine life without my fix...its like the one thing i really enjoy...

dont get me wrong...i love my family...and i know what im doing is wrong...i dont have anyone i can talk to about this  and i feel like im going to fuck up and end up copping...

i last copped on saturday..$50....then another $40 last night....and now im thinking of coppin another 100 worth with money im not supposed to spend...i

im just ranting butni guess this is a cry for help or support or just approval to go ahead and fuck up as long asbi have a plan to really quit..(ive reset my NOMO countless times)

all i keep thinking is ""its just another 100 bucks....we'll put it back""....my mind is repeating that scene from Requiem where they keep dippin into the shoebox....

fuck...i feel like im already going to fuck up and give on...shit im even tempted to leave work early today to cop...my saturdays are shitty if i wake up without dope...im bouncing off walls and frantic from the moment i wake up...

ive got one more month....and then this has to fuckin stop...im tired of this merrygoround and want off....but having access to this cash is fuckin me up...

to cop or not to cop....that is the question...

fuuuuuuck i cant turn off the voices in my head

i guess im just lookin for some kind of support here ..sorry if this is a bitchy shit post.....ill be sitting here checkin my phone for orange envelopes like im waitong for the dopeman to hit me back and say its all good...

TL;DR I was about to die to my addiction, did a 180, got clean and I'm happier than ever.

Anyway, 4 months ago I had a meta realization that my life was falling completely apart and that I was fooling myself into thinking it was fine. I was stealing money, selling whatever I could, doing whatever I could, to get my shit. I was doing 13-15 30mg oxys a day. I was destroying my nasal passages and my life/relationships.
Suicide crossed my mind almost daily. I was so miserable and was barely existing let alone living. The entirety of my days consisted of trying to find money or pull some scheme to get well. I put on a good act though, as none of my friends or family knew. Finally one day I reached my limit. I was sick for almost 3 days, had no money.  Hadn't eaten in a few days. Hadn't showered, hadn't slept. 
I just stayed locked in my room crying and sweating and sick. My body actually felt like it was shutting down, I could feel the life being stripped from my soul, literally. I sat with a loaded gun in my hands just looking at it and thumbing around with it deciding what to do. I felt like such a coward in that moment. Not because I hadn't pulled the trigger yet, but because I didnt want to exist anymore. 
While I was contemplating how to do it, my mother called me, (i told her i had been feeling under the weather) 
She told me my aunt called her and told her 
""Tell ____ everything is okay, I'm not sure why but I have this feeling that he needs to know everything is going to be fine and that hes not alone. Tell him I love him and that whatever hes going through, he can do it""
I started crying even heavier and begged my mother to come over without really telling her why. When she got to my place i explained everything. Literally everything. She was mad/upset/every other emotion imaginable, but she said we could take care of it together. And that I didnt have to do any of it alone. She called so many places for me looking for somewhere to take me. And found an outpatient place that could see me the next day. I went and started subs that day. 
It's been 4 months on subs and I haven't looked back once. Haven't had a single relapse or even a thought to do so. You couldnt pay me to go back to that. 
I have a job, I have friends I see daily, I actually laugh and genuinely smile. Im starting to remember all the positives that life has to offer. Having come through all of this has forced a new perspective on life Into me. I now realize how precious life is, and how important interaction/relationships can be.
My dr holds classes/meetings for patients/addicts/families of addicts/ and anyone that wants to show up. I recently started leading some of them and it feels amazing. I'm going on a podcast next week to tell a more detailed version of this and more details about before I was clean and the entire process. 

I never thought I'd be clean. I figured I would die with a crushed Roxy in my nose. I used to read this sub and all the posts of people saying ""if I can get clean anyone can"" and scoff at them. But I understand now. And it is actually true, any of us can get clean. Not everyone wants to, and that's fine. But if you want to, you absolutely can. If you made it this far, thankyou for reading all of this. I missed you guys and it's nice to be back. Love you all <3

Now I need a game plan.,"I have destroyed my marriage and my wife. She never deserved this. I feel lower then low right now. I have never been this low in my life.

What I thought would never happen to me has finally happened. I overdosed. What started out as a Kratom habit finally lead up to a near fatal overdose in just one year after being clean for 5. I suspected something was wrong with the dope because it was so white. I actually thought it was fake. Guess I was wrong. My wife literally saved my life by calling 911.

I just finally got out of the hospital and here’s where I’m at: My wife is most likely going to divorce me. I don’t blame her with the constant lies and sneaking behind her back. This was her last straw. She has always been up front about drugs since the start. I have not. If we stay together I will just keep doing more damage to her. I know I’m going to receive something negative feedback for hurting and scaring such an innocent person multiple times. I take full responsibility for my actions.

I was also thinking I should literally check myself into an outpatient program ASAP like, later today when they open. How do you guys feel about that? Any past experiences?

While being escorted out of my apartment. I remember what seemed like 50 people scattered around outside my building as well as  multiple fire trucks, ambulances and cop cars. Mostly cops, medical personal and a few of my neighbors so I’m definitely at risk of being evicted. I learned that apartment complexes can request information regarding tenants being carried away in an ambulance. Any comments?

I was also curious. At the hospital, after the Drs and other paramedics were done doing their thing. A woman came in with a computer, asked me a bunch of questions and the. asked me to sign something. I guess it was a consent form? Well, since I had no idea what I was signing I refused. I asked her for a print out. She said “sure no problem, let me get that for you, one second” and then she disappeared and was never seen again. Maybe she forgot? Does anyone know what or who that signature was for exactly?

I may have even given it back to him and scolded him about it except that when I went to his room (door was open) I found powder all over his desk, right out in the open where any one of the animals could touch it and die.. turns out, he was fucking smoking it in his bedroom,  which, is right next to the living room where my kid plays.  

I threw him out.. threw his shit onto the porch and when he came home with my truck after being gone 8 hours for a 30 min Dr apt, he went apeshit.  He flailed out on the porch for a good 3 hours and tried to break into the house until I pushed a loaded shotgun in face. He left finally.

So I call my guy who currently lives out of country but has guys in the US who run his business. I asked for 100 bag of brown and 50 bag of white. The driver gets here and only gave me white but I thought it was the dope so I was fine with getting no coke. But I open it and turns out he only gave me white. Now I’m sick af and the last thing I want is coke, I need dope, so I text my guy immediately and ask him to send him back but he said I had to go meet him.

So he sends me address and I go there. I sit there waiting on a side street in the ghetto next town over from me. I ask him again where to go and he sends me an address right down the street so I go there. This Spanish kid comes up to my car and I ask who he’s waiting for. He said “(blank)” and I said oh me too! Can I wait with you? (Afraid that I wasn’t gonna be able to meet the driver again but I thought oh well they’re coming to this guy next so I’ll definitely be able to meet them now)

I soon realize he speaks zero fucking English and he calls my guy out of country (who speaks English but not perfectly) and he tells me I need to give him more money if I want the brown. I tell him I’ll give the white back if he can give me the brown but we weren’t understanding eachother for some reason. Eventually I just say “hey can I just pay you the rest tomorrow” and he says ok that’s fine. 

But I keep asking him when the driver is coming and tell him I’m with the dude the drivers going to next. The kid finally hands me the bag of dope after all of us going back and forth for like 10 minutes.  (I didn’t realize he was trying to hand me something this whole time but I couldn’t understand him) and I finally realize that this was the dude I was supposed to meet to get the brown! But I thought I was meeting the  driver who came to me before.

This whole time we both keep calling the guy and he keeps trying to tell me that the dope is IN THIS KIDS HAND! I was like OHHHHHHH okay...so since the time I met the kid to the time I left, it took at least 30 minutes of him sitting in my car and us both calling my guy back and forth and me trying to communicate with this Spanish kid who speaks no English at all. I was so relieved when he handed me that bag but I felt so stupid for this process taking so long. But after he hands me the bag he kept asking me for the money and I kept trying to explain that I already paid. So he calls the guys AGAIN and I talk to him and tell him to tell this kid the deal with me already paying and paying the rest tomorrow, so basically the translate for me. So finally he does and I’m all set. I wish he told me that the kid walking was the dude who had my dope. I thought he was just another person buying off of them waiting for the driver but turns out he’s one of his dealers lol I just wish he spoke a word of fucking English it would’ve been so much easier.

Sorry if I didn’t explain this good, it was a very complicated situation, but I was sick as fuck which made it 10 times worse. Got my dope tho so I’m cool with it all lol


Side note: I thought the kid came up to my window because he thought I was the driver. Turns out the whole time he was just trying to sell me the fucking bag lol ",1552042956.0

In the last week, my life has been turned upside down. Here’s a little background for context. I am 28 years old, and have been in and out of sobriety since I was 17. I went to a 90 day treatment in January of 2018. I stayed sober for a little over eight months, and in that time, I had so many awesome changes than ever before in my life. My girlfriend of nine years and I purchased a brand new home, I left an awesome career for an even better one, and my relationships with my family and friends were getting better than ever before. I relapsed on oxycodone that we’re literally sitting out on the bathroom sink at my girlfriend’s grandparents house. Since then, it’s been a constant struggle to stay sober. My girlfriend would find out, then I would get sober again for a month or so, and relapse again. 

For the last four months I’ve pretty much been using full time, but switched from pills to smoking heroin about a month ago. Even during this time I was keeping everything hidden very well, and things were looking up in my relationship and in my career. 

My girlfriend, we’ll call her “Claire”, is the absolute light of my life. I have basically grown up with her, and she is simply incredible. She does not use drugs at all, and rarely drinks. Her family had a lot of substance abuse problems, and it just turned her off of it. She has been with me through it all. She’s saved my life on multiple occasions during overdoses, and his been nothing but supportive and loyal even when I felt like I didn’t deserve it. When I went to treatment this last time, she was introduced to Al-anon, basically a 12 step program for the families of alcoholics and addicts. They really focus on stopping enabling behavior. I think it has really helped her not take my drug use personally, and there isn’t anything that she can do to keep me sober, I have to do the work. 

This past weekend I was sleeping in a little bit on Saturday morning, and she looked in my Jean pocket it’s from the night before and found my stash. I was being very careless because normally I would keep that hidden in my car. She woke me up crying and heartbroken and told me I had to leave. It broke my heart to see her so hurt. She told me she knows not to take it personally, but it just hurts because she thought I was finally sober. She also told me that her heart breaks for me and it hurts for her to watch me struggle with this. It was really emotional when I was packing up my things, getting ready to leave the beautiful home we had saved up for for years knowing we were done. Claires set very clear boundaries with me after the last relapse, and one of those were that we had to be done. She couldn’t handle going through this anymore. I completely understand, and she deserves so much better. 

After we set our goodbyes and I left the house, I went straight to my dealers house and actually injected heroin. I was so distraught and sad. This beautiful life that we have worked so hard for seemed to be crashing down. She let my sponsor and parents know that she found heroin on me, and all of them reached out to me to let me know they loved me, but I had to figure this out on my own this time. I have been staying in a hotel since then, crying myself to sleep every night. From the outside looking in, it seems so simple. Just don’t use drugs, in the whole world is yours. It’s just not that simple for some reason. This addiction has made me hate myself. Even though I am somewhat successful (not trying to be braggy), I feel that if I was not an addict, I could be so much further ahead in life. It seems like opiates have ruined relationships with people who love me and are loyal to me, but for some reason I am more loyal to the opiates than my loved ones. I am getting the keys to an apartment tomorrow, and I am in the process of moving some stuff around at work so I can take a week off at the end of this month to detox. What hurts is that even if I get sober again and stay sober, I don’t know that Claire and I will get back together. I think I have just hurt her too much at this point. She has been checking on me regularly, and has been nothing but loving and supportive. But she still is sticking to her boundaries of us not being together. 

I really want to get this monkey off my back, and not have it run my life like it has since I was 14 years old. This is all I know, and while I would like to believe that I am a pretty high functioning addict, this lifestyle is not sustainable for me. If you pray or meditate, please keep me in your thoughts and prayers. I will keep you all in mine. Again, I’m sorry for this long and rambling post, I just had to talk this out somewhere. I love you all, and I hope you all find true love and happiness in your lives.

All of my veins, at least any that are accessible to me on my hands, forearms, upper chest/shoulders have died off one by one. The ones I know still to be there are surrounded by enough scar tissue to bend a needle 90 degrees if i twist or move that area in the slightest...  

The last few days have been hellacious. I’m wondering if maybe it’s just time to switch to the longer needle, if that will even help...  the rigs I’ve been using forever(.5cc 31g 8mm) ...now that generally I have a fresh rig every time I fix... this somehow hasn’t helped near as much as it normally does when I get a fresh box. 

My arms are wrecked, you guys. Years and years of this I believe has sort of killed the nerve endings around where I hit so it seems like if and when I’m missing, pushing through or off by just a smidge, I don’t even feel it until its way too late.  

Getting anything to register properly has never been so difficult. It has been an extremely frustrating week. It’s bad enough that I’m planning a hiatus on subutex starting tomorrow. I figure taking a few days break for all the swelling to subside can’t hurt. 

I just want one of my pipelines to come back. :(

Even though it’s been a few years since I’ve last tripped, I still know what the effects are like, such as the hallucinations and what not.
Anyways, I got all four of my wisdom teeth pulled out last week, and was prescribed 6 pills of Percocet.  The pain was so immense the fist two days that when I took them I didn’t notice any effects other than constipation and sleepiness.
2 days after I ran out, I had to call my doctor and ask for some more because I was in so much pain.
I just got six more, and now 2 days later my pain has gone down, and I’m using the last of my Percocet, but what’s weird is when I take one, within the first 20 minutes, I begin to experience some visual effects similar to the very beginning of a come up on LSD.
Is this common at all?

Whether like above board or underground? There was a piece on NPR tonight about it and it lead me to do some reading. I saw that these types of guided trips have been used to treat alcoholism and to help people quit smoking in the past with a surprising rate of success. This got me wondering if it would have the same type of success for opiate addiction or if it would be less successful because of the theory some people have that ""a drink is a drug is a man"" or ""a drug is a drug no matter which one it may be"" or however it goes. I've never really been a believer in this theory considering that the 8 years clean time I had I was on bupe maintenance and I have always been able to drink in moderation, and  I have never had a problem turning down uppers or other drugs that I dont enjoy, leading me to believe that my poison is my poison, not all drugs are automatically the same. Does that even make sense? I have to wo dr why these trials were done on alcoholics and not drug addicts in the first place and if that is the reason or if there is another reason that I am overlooking. 
Also I am just curious if anybody has had experience with this in general and if it was successful. I am looking for a way out not just of addiction but in terms of depression as well and it seems like these kinds of treatments could have real potential to be successful where antidepressants fail.

It was a chill evening...

Heroin
Cocaine
Pregabalin

The high was kicking in and we had enough...

Because my little brother gave me half of his last hit I gave him my last sandwich.

Out of Nowhere my brother turned blue and started to shake violently.

First I realised he was choking and having a seizure.

I did my best and 5 minutes of heimlich maneuver to make him spit out that nasty bite.

He was still shaking mad so i gave him a heart massage and shouted his name. Without results.

His eyes looked horrifying, My Hands grabbed his underweight body and put him into a safe position so he cant choke on his vomit.

After 15 Minutes he started to react to my crying calls...finally...

He was still shaking and almost unconcious.. Trying my best to calm him down I gave him a Heart massage because his breathing was still slow.

Never been so scared..

Suddenly he came back and didnt realised what happened.

He could barely speak but was getting better.. 

Gave him water, some hugs and kisses and he was over the mountain...

Im so glad hes alive..

took half of his dope as an reward and smoked it..

Still processing what the fuck happened..

Is it because he was coming down of the coke into a massive heroin high? Was it because the Pregabalin? he smoked alot and doesnt have a opiate tolerance like I do...

I quit my job cause i used all the time there and was where i got my dope from (co worker). I got ready to cold turkey and get through the hell week that is withdrawal. The only meds i got to help out was some xanax and a few addys so i didnt totaly zonk out on the xans. At this point i was using anywhere from 1 to 2 1/2 buns a day so i was expecting pretty serious withdrawals since i had been sick before obviously i knew what i was about to endure. I dont remember the exact doses i was taking per day but i kept waiting for the withdrawals to hit me hard. After one week when i ran out of my meds i had experienced none of the symptons i was used to feeling other than being fatigued a lot. No muscle aches, no nausea, no diarrhea, no insomnia, no sweats or shaking, absolutely nothing. The weirdest shit ever but i just took it as some type of sign that it was time for me to quit and has helped me to stay strong and stay clean. Idk why this happened but i am grateful and just wanted to let you guys know that its possible to get through this you just have to want it and be done with the lifestyle of forever hustling to get high and avoid the sickness.

Help,"My pain specialist changed practices and I got a new doctor today. She told me I have been getting to much medicAtion this whole 3 years according to the CDC “recommended guidelines”. Key word is recommenced. She does not feel comfortable exceeding this amount she says and has to reduce my Percocet from 4 down to 3 a day. I also take 20mg of embeda (morphine ER with naltrexone) twice a day. Then she recommend that I go ahead and drop the Percocet all together and add morphine ir 15mg 3 times a day to take its place. She said this is called replacement therapy and helps with your tollorance levels and makes it more effective. I told her if she thinks it will help my pain then I was willing to try it. My question is that I am terrified that the 15mg ir morphine will not work as well as the 10mg Percocet. She said it would but she does not suffer from chronic back/leg pain from a gym injury. I had a ruptured disk at the L5-S1 level that smashed the nerve and I worked with it like this for a year as a server and kept working lifting weights. I could rep 405lbs deadlifting so I was really lifting ok. I’m strong, 33years old, and tough but this took me from aspiring bodybuilder to a weeping baby in a wheelchair because of the nerve damage. A microdiscectomy, PLIF L5-S1 fusion, 2nerve block injections, 10epidurL inkections, 12 triggerpoint injections, Countless hours of PT, and ongoing pshycological treatment later I’m now waiting on insurance approval for the Senza HF-10 spinal cord stimulator implant to try to help the pain since they absolutely will not increase my medication because I’m “to young”. All this coupled with the fact that she is cutting one dose a day off of my breakthrew medication either way. She gave me the choice and I said whatever she thinks is fine. I do not abuse my medication and actually end up with several extra pills each month. At one point I had an epidural that was so perfect it controlled my pain almost 100% and I VOLUNTEERALLY went off of the embeda 100% for 3 months. After the epidural wore off I had to go back on the embeda. They told me I was the first person in the history of the practice to volunteer to drop a narcotic medication lol. With this being said I am not worried about the euphoria or high or any of that crap when I ask this question. Is this change going to be terrible? Or could it help? Thoughts? Questions concerns?

And a Sub related question.,"So... having used on off for the past few years, actively and majority of time last year, I’m trying to cut the habit out. However, I’m finding that I can kick the habit.. physically, fairly simply. As in, I can crank through the physical withdrawals pretty easily ESPECIALLY with less than 1 8mg sub.. I do a 1/3 strip, first day, 1/4 the next, and 1-2mg pieces for the next day (or two). Usually am fine, good to go! 

But this is my question... it seems to be the mental part, the temptation to want to just go get high after a week, 3 weeks, or close to a month being clean (when there is NO physical WD symptoms left), that I’m having the most difficult time refraining from. 

It’s as if, this moment comes along.. I’ll be working out, clean, feeling great for days/weeks, then this moment comes where I think about the possibility of getting high. I debate it, but it’s in that moment that I decide to do so or not to do so. If I decide against it, I won’t do it. But if temptation overrides, and I consciously decide to do it, I immediately start calculating how long the drive will be to score, how long it will be until taking first hit, etc. in that moment, if I decide to do it, my entire world shifts around the premise of “I am going to get loaded, and how can I weasel my way out of any obligations between now and getting high.” 

So, is the mental aspect of staying clean suppose to be the most difficult part? Or am I an anomaly? Because for the longest time, that exact routine is what “convinced” myself that I didn’t have a problem.. cause I could stop, and be okay, where others couldn’t even get past the physical aspect of WD. 

—

Next question is this:

I read everywhere that Sub withdrawals are far worse and longer lasting than opiate... if I were to take only 1-2mg daily for a week or two weeks straight, would I incur those same described Sub WD’s? Or is that in reference to someone trying to kick them that have been on them (and probably a higher daily dose) for years on end?

I guess, how long of use, and how high of dose of Sub is entering the realm of “bad sub WD’s?”

Cause honestly, the MINOR sub buzz I can achieve off even 1-2mg (when I have low opiate tolerance) is sometimes just as satisfactory as opiate high... 

Hear me out: it’s cause, I tend to use opiates for a purpose.. working out, studying longer/waking up earlier, socializing, etc. and the minor buzz achieved from small dose subs, gives me JUST enough of that careless/semi energetic feeling, to where I feel “great” not just good.. therefore, am stimulated in social situations, can lift longer in the gym, study with more ease..

Premise to this illustration is, if trying to use subs (in the meantime) instead of using dope, how long can this last at the minimal dose I described before I start trading minor buzz for 3 week long Sub WD?

They had titles like ""Yes addicts using OTC med to get high and landing in the ER"" and then did not even go on to explain at length the drawbacks and limitations and cardiac risks in depth, it just made me angry.

I badly need to take a break bc my tolerance is stupid now and it’s just not worth it so I wanted to jump to subs or kratom or something just to take a few days off. I’ve been using between .5-1.0 per day, Closer to 1.0. Anyone have an idea of how much suboxone would help or kratom? I used to use like 1mg subs for 120mg oxy habit idk what it takes for dope. Also how long should I wait? Minimum 24 hours at least correct?  Thanks guys, I’ve been scared to use the subs I don’t wanna go into PWDs. ",1552000031.0
