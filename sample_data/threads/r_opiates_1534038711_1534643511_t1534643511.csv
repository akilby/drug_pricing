98gjrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/98gjrx/federal_marshals_used_my_house_to_stake_out_my/,7,https://redd.it/98gjrx,johnnyszn,Federal Marshals used my house to stake out my dope dealing neighbors,"I don’t believe in god but I swear this is true. It’s a long story but worth the read. Backstory; I live in a small town on the rise right outside of the one big city in my state. I also live right by a prestigious liberal university so most my neighbors are students. I have two roommates, Chris and Tyler. We had this one neighbors for a while that sold bud and nothing else. One day they were gone and new neighbors moved in. We noticed right away they were dealing something. Always people coming and going on foot or pulling up in a car just to leave two minutes later. I leave for work early in the morning and there’s always a line of people waiting outside for the dboy to wake up. 

So one night I’m taking a little xan nap in my room at about 9 dark. We had smoked a couple bowls in the kitchen around 4 but we also cooked so the smell was gone. Tyler is at the kitchen table minding his own business when he hears a loud knock on our back door. We’ve had a couple meth heads knock on our door and ask for random shit and when we say no they tend to freak out and become disgruntled. Also, my pet peeve which I’ve tried to instill in my roommates is don’t answer the door for anyone you didn’t invite. If it’s someone we know they will texts us. Fuck surprise drop ins. So my roommate assumed it was another meth head so he went and grabbed his little pistol. He opened the door gun first. He was greeted with two badges in his face. Immediately he put the gun down and started apologizing. The men (who we thought were cops) were super chill and just laughed at the situation. They politely asked if they could use our backyard for a stake out. Still being in shock chris says that’s fine and he goes back inside.

While Tyler was talking to the guys his girlfriend grabbed all the paraphernalia and hid it in Tyler’s room. They both went into the bedroom while I was still asleep. About 15 minutes later they knocked again and asked if they could use our kitchen because it has a better view. Tyler doesn’t know what to do so he says yes. Another 15 minutes passes and Chris comes downstairs to see two guys with bullet proof vests, AR’s and glock 45’s. They explain what is going on and Chris new I was asleep so he goes into my room to warn me. I am woken up by my door opening but before I can come to he’s pulling me up by my shirt and whisper yelling “Johnny there’s fucking cops in our living room hide your shit now” then he walks out without any other explanation. So I hide my shit but I’m still barred and a little stoned so I’m not freaking out. 

Curiosity got the best of me and I decided to see what was going on for myself. So I sneak out my back window and walk right past the kitchen window to scope the block. I see this old lady limping around the front lawn of the dboy’s house pretending like she’s looking for something but she was actually doing recon. Then I see a guy in the distance hiding behind a parked car who kind of looked like a cop so I got scared and ran back inside. Once I was inside I thought I better introduce myself to the cops so they know there’s a 4th person home. All the lights are off in my house so I can’t see anything. I go into the living room, no one so I go into the kitchen and two men scare the fuck out of me. I introduce myself and ask them what they are doing. They tell me they have good reason to believe the neighbors are dealing dope (they would never say a specific drug just dope) and that they suspect them of doing some other wildly illegal things. They also tell me they aren’t cops but FEDERAL MARSHALS LMAOOO.

Then one of the feds asks me “hey were you outside a few minutes ago?”
Yeah I was confused by this whole deal and went outside to see what was going on. 
“We saw you walk past the kitchen window a few times, did you go out the front door?”
Yeah that’s what I did *nervous laugh* I’m sorry if I wasn’t suppose to go outside
“No worries man. You guys can do whatever you need to do. It’s your house of course. We would just ask to keep all the lights off”

So I go into Tyler’s room where everyone else was chilling. We are all paranoid af because we have a shit ton of weed paraphernalia in all of our rooms. It’s hidden but shit just got real now that we know they are federal marshals. We decided to take a couple shots since we can’t smoke and we need to relax a bit. We start drinking for a bit. The feds periodically gives us updates and bs with us a little. Apparently there were 25 other agents all on the block staking out the house and one of them spotted me lol. 

It’s bin about two hours since they came inside. It’s midnight and we all work mornings but we can’t sleep since there’s feds in our house. Tyler and I go into the kitchen to make something to eat. Right as we finish up one of the feds gets a call and tells us we need to stay in Tyler’s room because shit was about to get poppin and for our saftey we need to be in the opposite side of the house. Now there’s no way we can sleep but it’s okay because all dislike the neighbors and want them gone.

Unfortunately nothing happens and the Feds tell us they are going to head out. They get our phone numbers and share some more information about what’s going on so we can help them if we see anything. They leave at 3:30am and as they we see a whole convoy of undercover vehicles leaving the block. 2 minutes later a black SUV pulls up and the neighbors run outside with a couple bags and boxes and take off in the suv.

The next morning we are all at work and around 9am I get a call from one of the feds asking if they can use our house to continue the stake out. Chris and I work far away so Tyler was the only person who could let them in. He sneaks into the house through my window and makes sure everything is hidden but before he’s done the feds are on our front step knocking on the door. They were parked down the street already and saw Tyler go into the backyard. So he lets them in and they are being super nice. They said they will stay in the kitchen and not go into any other rooms. I highly doubt they didn’t do a little snooping since no one was home but I was clean at the time so the only drug we had in the house was weed.

Around 5pm I get home and they are still here. They are up in Chris’ room spying through the upstairs window and they left all there guns on the kitchen table hahaha. We chit chat for a bit, show them our guns and they even let us look at theirs. We didn’t get to touch them but one of the feds did let us hold his military grade taser which was so badass. Anyway they leave around 7pm and the same thing as last night happened. Right as the feds left a black suv pulled up and the neighbors went inside super fast and the suv sped off.

A couple days passed with no word from the feds. Dboy must have put business on pause because no one was coming through. No more line in the morning or any cars coming or leaving. I don’t think they had been outside the house for days. Until the third day when I got home and there was about 10 Latino dudes dogging me out so I parked my car and went inside. 10 minutes later a cop comes barreling into the alley between our houses, the guys go running but not fast enough and they arrest someone. I don’t have any information about that arrest but it must have accomplished something. 

Ever since that arrest it’s been real quiet on my block. The neighbors think we’re snitches but we didn’t have a choice and we could have called the feds multiple times when they were doing sketchy shit but we didn’t. We like to mind our own business.

Anyway, sorry if that story was boring but at the time it was insane! I’m sure I left some things out so if anyone has a question feel free to ask :)

I've been using a cheap Bic disposable pen that I removed the back cap and ink cartridge from as a tooter ever since I started smoking my opiates. After a while I get some gnarly resin build-up which as we all know, is pretty potent stuff. To clean it, I used to just scrape it with a paper clip to get everything out, put it on some foil, and smoke away. But I've found that putting my finger over one end and putting a few drops of boiling hot water into the other end, covering that end with my finger, and then vigorously shaking it for about 2 minutes, works a lot better to get the resin out. After that, I take a large piece of foil, dump the resin-y water onto it, and evaporate the water to leave behind the resin, which I promptly smoke. I was just wondering if y'all had any different or better methods to getting resin out and using it. Just getting tired of the water method because the whole process takes a while.
NO, I will not use foil as a tooter. Too fragile. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",1534635925.0

So I’m not sure what to do but the effect these have, though they are strong have a rough go at your body. I’ve switched down to 2mg dillies to shoot now and I’m actually finding thing a lot bette4 health wise as far as shooting up goes.

I am new to Spain. I get kidney stones every few years and periods of severe migranes 2x a week that then disappear for months. Can someone familiar with Spanish pharmacies tell me what I should ask a doctor for? I need a an equivalent for Vicodin ES (migranes), and an equivalent for fast release Morphine 30 or 60 mg (kidney stones). Generic is best as trademark items are very expensive here if you have to pay cash. I can get 30mg cody / 500mg paracetamol fizzy tabs for 12cents each over the counter, but they don't do the job anymore and all that paracetamol is better avoided.

I tried asking the doc for something stronger than codiene, he flat out refused to give me opiates and instead gave me Novotil (metamizol), which is a decent painkiller, but I had a reaction which wiped out all my white blood cells and had me in the ICU for a week with huge infections and black rotting toes! This is a documented syndrome effecting persons of western European heritage for some reason, and Spain will probably join the rest of the world in banning Novotil.

I have always understood the principles of harm reduction and in my initial research I quickly realized that most of the guides I found on the Internet were incorrect or misleading in one manner or another. With that in mind I am just finishing up what I believe to be an entirely factual guide where the contents are based on medical publications or actual experience and not assumptions or unsubstantiated opinions.

I have run into a bit of a snag: In addressing the most common mistakes that people make I am really only guessing as I perfected my method over a year ago. I’m also lacking in fully understanding the stigma and aversions to this route of administration that people may have so even if it is something you think you would never do, you can help by letting me know about that as well. If you tried this and found it underwhelming (lots of people apparently have) then a detailed description of the method you used could help me a lot (as detailed as possible), please PM it to me if you would be so kind as to help out. If you do, please indicate if it’s ok to mention your reddit username as having helped. Thanks. 

The first time I tried it was only after many hours of research and I was totally overwhelmed and even blown away, and I have never used the very harmful nasal insufflation method since that time.",1534616406.0

Someone in another thread asked what a bubble was, which is how I referred to the packaging of my dope. And as I was omw to score some dope and coke, I said I would post a pic of it. Of course the coke is already gone, but I just remembered and took a pic of what's left lol. 




 Here you see a tourniquet, syringe w needle, an unpacked bubble and a closed one with 0.3g of dope and a cooker with a cigarette filter and a micro filter in it. Syringes and needles come separately here, so you can put on the micro filter, draw up the stuff, take the filter off, put the needle on then shoot.

I started smoking pot frequently freshman year of high school and throughout the years I was getting worse I started to really try pills, coke, and other illicit drugs my junior year and by senior year I was pretty addicted to using drugs just either had couple day/week binges then be sober or only use a couple days a week if that but now a year has past exactly since I started using suboxone daily for 1 year now my family has been trying to get me off then to save my life as I’ve never seen a problem with them by prescription but the only way I’d take them was IV or nasally mainly nasally but for a month or two I shot 2 subs a day for awhile but finally stopped and switched to snorting so I see I do still have a problem I just want my life to change for my sake/life and for my family and friends to be proud an back to the person they use to know not what the drugs turned me into.  

I snuck subs into rehab as I got out a couple days ago and began detoxing I’m on the 3rd day of detox and it’s getting better each day especially the mindset on what lies ahead of me sober and if I’ll return back to normal but for 21 days I snorted up to a whole sub throughout the day to stay off sick and that place really taught me a lot an I truly do have a desire to stop using I just really need it work it but I just want some advice on how people stayed sober for years and years I shot heroin for a couple weeks and snorted/smoked it for 2 months before I got back on subs and am so grateful to have got off that shit but I really want my life back and to turn normal again so if you read this thank you I really needed to vent and would love advice from this sub as I use to frequent a lot and saw many great people on here but some asshole too

Addicts are no more selfish than normal people. In fact, the situation sometimes demands selfishness.

For example, your acquaintance asks to share your dub, which barely has two shots and you need one for your wake up. If you share, you won't be able to get to work in the morning and so miss a day's pay and perhaps get fired.

You see, it's not like sharing half your sandwich at lunch time. In fact, addicts frequently share food, drnks, clothing and blankets even though we will go hungry or cold.

Uh, what?

The guy claimed to have video, then said it was just audio, then said you couldn't hear anything but screaming anyway. 

Uh, no. We can all see the holes in this story.  But why tell it? This made me remember this twerp I knew.  He claimed to have been a heroin addict.  The minute I started chatting to him, it was clear it was all bullshit.  You should have heard his story about the concerned doctors at his bedside after he od'd. Drama king this idiot. He didn't know anything.  Not a thing. I asked him where he copped.  He said ""uptown."" Where? He didn't remember.  What stamps were on the bag? He didn't know. He was so full of it.

anyways,

so i need to find a more discreet way of using, so i decided to try to make some “cheese” since all we have over on the WC is tar. i used baked powder and about a gram of tar after freezing it, put it in an advil bottle with some nickles and shook the shit out of it. 

only thing is i was being a dumbass and definitely dumped way too much baking powder in but that’s why i ended up adding another half gram of tar to make it a full gram. 

i just want to know from people with experience does this shit look alright? already know i’ll be using way less powder next time lol.  

thanks again

I've even had one follow me out the door asking me for it. I should've called the police, but I'm not a snitch. And even if I wanted to sell them, I couldn't, because I take them for pain.

The stigma is very real. It's real for pain sufferers, anxious people, depressed people, addicts, and disabled people, etc...

Let me preface by saying yes, I am an idiot. I knew subs were for heroin maintenance. I knew it was potent for those with minor opioid tolerances. I knew it was extremely addicting. I didn't care, it cured me, even if temporarily. I'm still not sure I care completely about quitting.

I developed legitimate, minor addiction after 2 weeks straight of use around Oct. Nov. 2017. I had been using sparingly since 2014-2016  obtaining the drug from my fathers medicine stash (although I would also sparingly use opis from other sources such as tram (lots, although no dependence developed), and rarely hydro and oxy). It has been a monkey on my back ever since, I've kept it secret pretty well but I am worried my sparing use will lead to me losing my job, as dealing with the WD on the sales floor of a retailer is hell on earth. 

However my question is, could I get prescribed subs for my... sub addiction? Or am I better off pulling a tall tale and saying I was using oxy/h.

Again stupid question but appreciate any feedback.

Feedback greatly appreciated.,"So heres a little backstory. About 10 months ago I tried H for the first time and didnt really think about how serious of a decision I made and honestly didnt ever think about a possible addiction in the future but before you know it I was doing the shit everyday, only ever snorted never banged.

Things got out of hand pretty quickly and I realized I had to do something so I tapered my habit down to about half a point of (china white?) a day and then last week I went to a health center around where I live and was put on Clonidine and Gabapentin to help with any withdrawal symptoms I may experience while trying to quit. 

The reason Im confused is that its been 5 days and ive only taken .1mg Clonidine and 300mg Gabapentin once or twice a day and the only physical symptom of withdrawal Ive even noticed has been insomnia. Which I already experienced here and there before ever doing opiates, and it wasnt even that bad. Ive slept atleast 4 hours a night the past 5 days or so. 

Is this normal? Since my habit began Ive had to go without H a few times not by choice and it seemed to be a lot worse. The anxiety and everything, but this time ive had almost next to no anxiety about it and pretty much zero withdrawal symptoms. Is it just the meds doing their job or what? I havent even veen taking the recommended daily dose. 

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Previous to H I'd only done percs and opanas here and there so Im pretty opiate naive compared to most people with a habit. Thanks in advance!",1534551884.0

The last 8 months of using were speedballs while popping 4mg of xanax, 60mg of Addy everyday.

So back in December a bunch of bad shit started to occur. One morning i'm walking into my job and there are multiple desk so everyone kind of greets you, to my luck a loaded rig fell out of my jacket and bounced on the ground and the room was silent as my boss's eyes started to water...Everyone thought I was clean again and here I was just to hurt everyone again. I left to get high and to kill myself. At this time  I was using multiple times a day and got sepsis from multiple Staph infections and my body started to reject the H. I would register and then up or down the vein it would start to balloon under my skin and I started missing even when hitting the Jugular. I was so depressed and couldn't really get high so I was WD and decided to cut myself thinking I should just die, as I cut I noticed my blood was extremely sticky. Out of all the red flags in my life this was the only thing that got my attention. I went to the doctor and was told if I don't stop ill die.

So fast forward I stop using and it was withdrawals I didn't even know existed. I had a fever for about 80 days, extreme depression with normal WD stuff. I somehow never got out of the acute WD stage. How the fuck is that possible??

I've been shooting up 4- 5 2.5mg dillies for the past 2 months. I was previously on MMP 5mg a day.
I found 70ug/hr 40mg patches and I know that's too high for what I need.


The question is: can I cut the patches in a way that I can use them to get a lower dose?

I need to stop now or my wife will take my kid away.

These patches are the ones that come with a metal layer to start the release, I was thinking about cutting the whole thing and leave the metal part there until I use it.

Please help.

Now I know this is highly frowned apon, and highly discouraged in the name of harm reduction.  


I have been IV'ing the pink liquid methadone you get from the clinics. Using a 3cc/3ml, 23g syringe, I am able to shoot half of a dose in one shot using these syringes.   


Here is where things get interesting. You know how orally, it takes methadone 1+ hour(s) to kick in? Well, via IV it kicks in instantly, with a rush and it is far more euphoric and warm than when you take it orally. It is on par, IMO, with H. It is amazing.  


Now, here is where harm reduction comes in. IV'ing anything that isn't made for IV is NOT GOOD. But upon further review, if you are being prescribed VistaPharm methadone, it is 100% safe to inject.   


Other INACTIVE ingredients in the liquid methadone solution:  
 **SORBIC ACID,**  **POTASSIUM SORBATE, POLOXAMER 188,** **GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL,**  **SUCROSE** and **WATER**   


Poloxamer 188 is related to Propylene Glycol. It is used to stabalize the solution. Propylene Glycol is actually used to make IV solutions, as is Poloxamer 188.   


So relatively safe, but as with IV'ing anything, it is not 100% safe, as there are still the risks that are associated with IV drug use. I am not sure what is in the other Methadone Oral solutions made by other companies, but if you are prescribed the VistaPharm brand, it is fairly safe to do.   


It is a lot of liquid to inject, but that rush and euphoria is something that I never expected from Methadone. ",1534520472.0

1.) does anyone experience cold sweats after eating a meal? I eat something at work and immediately I am cold sweating like a bitch.

2.) the use of kratom, short term for PAWS symptoms. I don’t really have any money for it but I am not looking to get high, just trying to ease some of the PAWS symptoms. Would any recommend this after the initial withdrawal phase?

3.) what things can I do for my stomach that has been insanely fucked up? I’ve got the Hershey squirts like a MOFO. I just took some loperamide but i know that first dose won’t do too much. Anything I can take OTC for stomach problems?

These don't go away, thats why even after a long, long break, you will be in withdrawal with just a couple of days of using.

My plan:

Exhaust myself with a little meth.. there’s method to my madness, I want to use as little of my benzos as possible to get to sleep-, but once I go to sleep on the first day  here’s the plan....

5-10MG of Lorazapem, + 300-600MG of lyrica, as my primary withdraw agents

Will titrate with Clonindine - which might even help with the leg pain 

Looking @ all interactions they seem to compliment and enhance each other, which is why we will be monitoring blood pressure, to keep it low but not under 70.


Bananas bananas bananas - that will be my food.

I have 10 8MG Ondanzetron for when or if the vomiting starts, plus immodium for the other end

Panadol for pain, & chewable vitamin c to help flush my system of all metabolites.

Water water water -

Hospital is 4 minutes away - should something go wrong.

If I cave, I have 32MG of Bupe tablets, & I will take them 1-2MG  absolutely ONLY if the Ativan & other combos don’t hold me at bay...& I reach for the oxy. 

I suffer anxiety, shaking, and hot cold sweats - I never get a runny nose, or the runs or anything it’s fucken weird ..

But -

That’s my plan.

Anyone see any issues?

I’ve waited until my mind is ready. In the past I’ve not been ready, and I’ve managed to go 24 hours & withdrawal was fucked ... if I only I could have held on for 24 more hours I might have climbed the mountain side ... to start shimmying my way down...

This time - 

I don’t need to hide anything, I don’t have to worry about being functional ...for a few days

I've been to literal war, I've risked my life countless times over countless things: stupid or otherwise. Yet here is where I always feel so scared.

That's what got me the last time) but enough to be afraid you'll fuck up the few days you did manage to gather. Enough to be so afraid it's easier to just give in. Or is that just another excuse?

Because honestly I've been trying to understand myself and trying to understand my addiction and there are a thousand right answers and seemingly no wrong ones. Same goes for all the fucked up shit that goes in my head: I can't figure out why, ever, because there seem to be no wrong answers. Only right ones that come to me like epiphanies as I wipe my asshole. One day I can suddenly \*\*understand why\*\* for fuck's sake I'm as trusting as a dead cat then three months later suddenly understand \*why\* again - and both answers fit. So which is it? Does it even matter for the healing process? I have no fucking clue.

If I'm going to be called the junkie, I might as well  go back to the junk, right?  Emnrace it, even though I've quit for now.
-------

I've really thought of myself as a junkie, but I'm just coming off an opiate addiction that went from a few pills every day to a lot of mgs of oxy  every day, to snorting a few points of heroin every day.  The whole thing lasted about 2 years this time and led me to try H for the first time in 2016.  

Fast forward to 2018 and I finally follow through on a commitment I made to my husband to get off opiates, but I'm doing it for me.  I even walked away from a decent hydrocodone prescription that got me by about one week a month, even though it was over 100 pills/month.

I quit everything in July with a mild taper and kratom, as well as the usual gaberpentin, weed, benzos.  Withdrawals weren't hell to me, probably from the kratom I'm now wanting to wean off of.  I got 31 days off H and 29 days off All opiates, when last week I was presented with a rare 4 nights alone, so I slipped and had a three day run that no one knows about but me.  After one day off I used again for two days last weekend, after having to put my dog down.

Last Saturday night after my husband and kids went to bed, and just hours after watching my dog die, I must have done a big dose and nodded out all over the house, including falling down in the kitchen and hitting my head on the bathroom mirror, nodding out while brushing my teeth.  Thank God nobody woke up.

Sunday night I did another big dose before bed and projectile vomited in front of my husband.  He couldn't even tell I was high, just thought I was sick.

This Monday morning  I woke up and said that was it.  I was saving over half g for my birthday, which is this weekend.  I ended up dumping all the heroin I had left (not the first time I've done this) and took some kratom instead.  I puked my first spoonful of that, but the rest of the week has gone pretty smooth.  Until tonight when my husband found out I smoked a little pot.  He called me a junkie for smoking pot, even though I've been on H a lot of times around him and he rarely notices.  When he does I just say it's my pain and anxiety pills.  I get no credit for quitting opiates.  He's actually ok with me taking pain pills by doctor prescription.  It's just hard to get a satisfying prescription these days.

He thought I was through with pot, he says tonight, but he sends mixed signals because sometimes he realizes it helps me with anxiety and pain, and minimized my use of harder drugs.

So now I'm the junkie, although I've never tried a needle, have fairly successfully quit opiates (it's a process), and he only knows about the pills anyway.  Maybe I should carry on with my commitment to quit the poppy plant, or maybe I should just become who I really am, be the junkie and go on one more run.  

In Breaking Bad Jessie embraces being a criminal (I'm the bad guy) and in Justified Boyd Crowder embraces, and comes to terms with being the Outlaw.  Perhaps I should heed my hubby's words and just embrace being the junkie.  I do feel I have one more run in me and I might as well do it while I can still stomach the horrible kratom that keeps me going now and will help me quit when it's time.",1534483055.0

I will sometimes, when I buy a good amount of pills 50-100-120, if I know they have been hidden tucked in the sellers underwear or if like today I am told by one of my dealers that he currently just got out of the hospital for a double bad eye infection and he just touched all these pills when he counted them and they were in his possession for a little while which im sure at some point probably he touched his face/eyes and touched the pills without washing his hands.


When I do occasionally end up needing to do this, I will just lightly soak a paper towel in 90% isopropyl Alcohol and one by one lightly rub each pill with the towel then throw them into a container to dry. I get that I may be a bit over reacting and my buddy called my weird earlier but these are things I am going to literally be eating so it gives me a little peace of mind knowing they are clean & disinfected now.


Actually while I was doing this earlier I saw amazon sells a UV light phone cleaner/ disinfector which I thought would be perfect for this application, as I wouldn't have to get the pills slightly wet with alcohol even though it dries almost immediately. Then I realized that might be a bit overkill plus I don't know if it would effect the pills potency in any way.

What do you guys think am I a weirdo for wanting to protect myself from who the fuck knows what after you get some pills that might have been tucked inside a baggie in some d-boys underoos or possibly have some infectious virus on it in my case.. or am I just being a big pussy going overkill with my germaphobia ?

I also bought some Fent Test strips and Mecke Regent test just so I can make sure when I have any doubts that something I might be getting is a little off, some of these fake presses getting made today can really be hard to tell even if you have the real thing right next to it to compare to which I try to keep one of each of the most common 30s around for reference because I do buy in bulk but not reselling them its all just personal use for my monster habit which sucks and I have to get under control by the end of the summer hopefully.",1534481164.0

I just inadvertently pissed off my aquaitance(friend, in reality)/middle. He's a really cool dude and I like him but he was charging me way too much for the amount of risk he actually took, I always waited for him to be making the run anyway (unless I was sick, he earned his money those days 💯), the girl lives in a fairly nice part of town, and I always drove his ass wherever he needed to before/after we did a run (and he took proper advantage of this) and I'd always buy him shit like water, sodi pops, cigarettes or whatever cause I don't like my friends going without, but don't get me wrong, that has no bearing on this situation cause I'd do that for whoecer, if we're friends I got you, and I know you got me if I'm in need. I can understand a middle who had to work for it (walking/ driving himself to the plug, going into a dangerous or hot part of town) charging everytime and never just doing it to be a good guy, but this guy had the best situation possible with me. I know for a fact with me coming, his runs were easier, and more likely to succeed. 

Fast forward to today; I get a call from the dude, he's not home, but he wants to go see the plug. All good, he tells me to pick him up at his friend's house so off I went down to the ghetto of the city we live in. When he walks out he is visibly high on crack; how can I tell it's crack you ask? Since we have little to none of them methamphetamines where I'm from. Well... very little anyway, i've seen pressed ICE pills, they're suspect to say the least, anyway my point is, dude is definitely smoking hard, and he is in full window watching/carpet surfing, paranoid about Alexa listening in on us mode. Shit, dude was sitting down in the car, but hitting up that crackhead shuffle. Dude was also trying to drink water, and if you know crack, you'll know how hard/ awkward it is to try and drink something, even with the thirst of a black dog in the scorching heat, drinking water on crack always goes weirdly.

Anyways, he finally decides it's time to call and get my run on the go, I wanted the one gram of cocaine, and four 4mg dilaudid, that's 150 (gram Tony Montana100, 8mg=$25) and this price is pretty good, standard in my area. So after checking his pockets, I see he's definitely missing something after he asked to use my phone, I realize he's missing his phone. At this point my junkie brain is scheming, I know I can get the number from this guy, I just need him to think he can use my phone, and that his is fine until we get back.  I convinced him, saying I didn't have time or the fuel to be going back since we are going back there after anyways. So after he uses my phone to call the plug, dude is way too high and not tech savvy enough to worry or even think about the plugs number in my shit. GOTTEM.

 So after we make the usual run, which in his state, took 25 minutes of talking (probably about some bs that only he cares about his car, his phone, whatever his crack riddled brain is settlling on!) I bet the plug was ready to kill herself for real. We go back to his place to do a shot. I do up a nice speedball, decided to try 8mg dilaudid + 2 pointsish of blow, by the way the girl is easily 8/10, it completely dissolves without even mixing, tastes like pure diesel and rings your fucking bell like crazy! (As you can likely tell from my post here, but frankly fuck it, you guys understand lol im gonna put a video in the comments of this shit dissolving like sugar) I even hit a vein first poke! Fuck yeah, i'm feeling like Ice Cube, today was a good day. 

Fast forward 2 days later, my main plug just  ran out of 8mg shields (the heart shaped 8mgs) and im getting ready to call my friend and go thru the bs and the extra money (it really sucks to get a good price on 8s for 3/4 of the month, then dude absolutely rapes me every single time we made a run). The run would take 5-10 minutes out of his life since the girl he went to was on disability and always wanted to make money, she only leaves home like 3 times a week for groceries, to play cards on Friday, and her daughters Sunday dinner we never had to wait or fuck around with her, probably the most professional dealer ive ever met (which is going to turn out great at the end of this story for me lol) she always gave him something to drink and tried to get him to eat, she was basically drug dealing grandma, not to mention this lady is always awake early, and will stay up late if you ask her to be ready, she will. She gets a large script for her hips, and this is her money she's hoarding away for her daughter and husband, this lady is a legitimate saint. 

Everytime he would charge me 20 bones, and a point of blow. So 30 bucks every.single.time I went on a run, and basically it was me driving him to the spot, for free and then giving him money and shit cause he knew the right person, which I never objected to, she had amazing blow and always had pills, so it was worth the little bit of extra money, but my ""friend"" never gave me a break, even on days that he got more than I did, on principle he ""had to charge me, his time is valuable""

So im scheming, deciding what im going to do for a plug since my main is out for the remainder of the month, than I remember about the number. I thought hard about it for at least a half hour, I like my friend, hell I even enjoy the drama and excitement that goes along with the run, it's part of the reason I like this drug and the game so much, it's always an adventure. But the money was killing me, I'm working hard, OT every day in the heat, planning  and working toward moving on up to a better apartment and some upgrades to my car and bike. So I decided to send her a text, she knew who I was instantly, my friend clearly calls on my phone, and they must chat about me during the deal. I straight up told her the truth, that I was a good customer, and that I loved the way she did business, but that I couldn't continue with it, purely monetary. She understands and tells me to come thru, I bring the usual 150, fully prepared to pay it but turns out it was only 125, my friend was adding 25 bucks into the coke, AND charging me 20 and a point. So at this point I don't even feel bad, I just love that this worked out. 

Today I get the text ive been waiting for, the dealing grandma, saint of the dope game, had finally informed my friend how she thought I was a lovely guy, and thanked him for the business by giving him a half, and an 8, 75 dollar business getting bonus! But dude is pissed at me, actually he says his ""feelings are hurt and I trusted you"", he says he enjoyed the runs and having me to hang out with, and he would have brought me in with him, so basically he would have got her to lie for him about prices, all while giving me the illusion that he isn't dry fucking my little virgin b-hole, and that it has nothing to do with the money 🙄. So anyway now im at a crossroads, I don't necessarily want to lose this friend, he's a good guy, but I just couldn't handle the fucking anymore. 

Anyways, what would you guys do? Would you cut him out (wouldn't be the end of the world, but I don't mind the guy, and it's hard to find friends who don't steal or whatever) or would you maybe just keep calling him to do runs? But renegotiate the prices. I'm opting to buy him a full g of blow, and a few pills just to shut him up about it. Help me out here. 

TL;DR- I had a ""friend"" that made runs for me, but charged me out the ass, I picked up said friend while he was high on crack, and basically schemed the plugs number out of him, got gud with the plug and now ""friend"" is upset, says it's about hanging, I know it's about money. ",1534473482.0

I’m a 28 year old on Suboxone and Klonopin. Please read and relate. I’d like to hear your story and how you overcame it (or still stuck in it) if you can relate.,"Can anyone relate to this?  I was pretty much a good kid in high school.  I had a great childhood and I never really did anything bad in high school.  Sure I partied but so did everyone else.  Weed and alcohol junior and senior year.  I always fill my mind with the past as to why I’m like this now.  College came (community then big schools) and that’s where everything slowly but surely got worse.  My drug habits got more diverse and my alcohol use went up.  It seemed to be the only thing fun about college.  I still graduated but it didn’t mean shit to me.  Basically my life has been regret since.  Regret about why I studied what I studied.  Why wasn’t I normal ?  I had a hot girlfriend for almost 3 years, experienced love, experienced basically everything a kid would growing up. 


Fast forward to now and I’m stuck on these thoughts: was it because I always admired crazy people and the biggest parties because they excited me most?  Was it because I got caught up with the wrong people?  I mean as kid I always wanted to break the rules even if it was breaking them lightly, like going to the neighborhood you weren’t allowed to go in because it was too far  (I always use the term it’s all relative).  I would quit a lot of things.  Start them and never finish.  I did break my arm as a sophomore and got prescribed opiates to this day I don’t remember what they were but I liked the feeling and especially the morphine drip they put me on in the hospital with the button.  I loved that button

My point is does anyone who takes subs think about this as they get older and let it plague them?  Also, if there is anyone similar to me I’d like to hear your story.  I’m on subs for 10 months now with 3 or 4 1 week benders in the middle.  Don’t know why I chose this route because I feel like it’s just a bandaid not fixing the problem but it’s the route I chose.  The problem is, in rehab I couldn’t figure out the problem!  Why I got like this in the first place.  Is it because of the genetic disease like they say in rehab?  I never believed that.  Whether it’s true or not I feel like I still could have avoided it.  I was one of those people that never took it too far but far enough that it became a major problem and the one that affects me most in my everyday life.  I’m definitely an addict I know that, but I never did as much in one sitting as the people around me and never shot up, never ODED etc.  Everyone in rehab would say “you will if you keep using” and that would piss me off so much.  I started to think I was better than them (which I wasn’t) either way rehab was a fail.  I got 100 or so days of all opiates but the alcohol use slowly affected more and eventually I went back, broke my collarbone a month later, it got worse, I was jobless at the time so after that bender I said fuck it I threw in the towel and went on subs thinking it would be easy like it was in the past on subs.  It’s not easy !  I moved to Chicago from Jersey for a new job in June, but I’m not joyful.  I don’t feel clean either, and I don’t take my job seriously nor am I motivated.  I also watch and read a time wasting amount of opiate related things (documentaries, movies, YouTube vids, reddit).  I’m debating starting all over.  Can’t take a shit to save my life (or a piss for that matter).

Iv tapered from 100-120 mgs per day down to 60 in the last month and just took my last tramadol last night. (25 mgs) 

For comfort meds I have some short acting sleep meds, lots of loperamide (radiation to the gut so Iv needed it daily for weeks), a little lomotil, CBD and marinol. 

To my benefit I think my body weight is way below normal, meaning I have very little body fat (normally 120-130 currently 96 lbs which is why I was given marinol). And I take diuretics twice daily along with magnesium and potassium. I dont know if there is any logic behind it but I suspect the diuretics probably keep chemicals flushed out of my system because when I was taking the norco it really only helped for about 2 hours leaving me with four hours in between where I was pretty damn uncomfortable. Maybe I was just to tolerant but one more reason to get my bodies own natural pain controls kicked back in and stop depending on liver killing pills. 

So my question is, should I ask my oncologist for anything else to help ease me away or should I be fine at this point? Iv had a lot off health issues in the last five years or so and had to come off pain meds a few times after a couple of months but not this long or at this big of a dosage. The last few days as Iv taken less and less Iv noticed some muscle soreness, more gut irritation than usual (crampy feeling) and a little bit of tingling restless leg/arms and needing to stretch without relief.

Now 6 months later I smoke H for the second time, well I was supposed to do it earlier but it was so low on my mind that I forgot it. It was pleasant like last time but a bit less actually, maybe the setting was not as good or the dope less powerful (I doubt it though since it made me throw up at the end). This time, I completely forgot the drug 2 days later. 

So, is it normal that it's less good as the first time if I wait so long or the dope was maybe less good? Anyway, fun drug I enjoy it but what a waste of time sitting on the couch all day.

I told them about my use of opiates and so I was treated with more pain pills than the usual person obviously. The first 3 days I was on 220mg+. Anyway long story short, they told me they couldn't send me home high and I had to detox in there and then a lady from the drug dependance unit came and seen me and I jumped from 220mg to nothing in 2 days, went into WD's in hospital then got put on subuxone.

Whatever it is, coke, tar (never shot good powder dope), crystal, hell I’ve even shot mdma lol, every shot seems to take about a minute to hit. I do get a rush, I think, but it’s def different from what a lot of people report. I guess I kinda like having a second to put my stuff away, rinse my rig out, put a hot compress on if needed. 

I just did a half point coke shot and went through that little routine. Then it started to hit me, after about a minute, so I laid down and wrote this. Not the best gear so .05 was a dumb small hit so I’m already back to baseline. I only have a pathetic .26 bag so I’m deciding whether to just slam the rest of the .2 (and yak a lot) or do two probably enjoyable .1 pushes. I’m one of those “I’m not a stimulant guys” who still does hardcore stim shit all the time but still tries to avoid the real rough edges of that game. I ate a hulk to calm myself down but a .2 shot still might be a little much. 

But so yeah, I’ve had other addicts agree that it’s not *that* fast but I see threads on here where people talk about feeling it just seconds after pushing down. My average seems to be about a minute before I start to feel it, maybe another 30 seconds to peak. Sometimes I hop around and hyperventilate and swing my arms around but I don’t think that even does much more than just standing up and taking a few quick steps. I have a super fast metabolism too, what gives? I feel like I’m missing something.



Also, completely unrelated crack head tangent here, there was a big news story recently, like national news somehow, was posted in here, about that billionaire dude Henry Nicholas. I guess the chick with him is an aspiring Real OC Housewife so I was reading all about their past scandals and scoping her IG and shit. That kind of lifestyle is already so morbidly fascinating but shit really gets crazy when you add a bunch of hard drugs. I don’t even live far from Newport I gotta get in touch with Henry Nicholas and make him hire me as his personal assistant.

So I wrote down the way I remember it.,"  I regained consciousness with narrowed vision, feeling disoriented and short of breath. 

'Fuuuuuck,' was the first thing I thought to myself looking up at the EMTs, firemen, and policemen who were crowding my body's resting place on the floor between the coffee table and the couch. My second thought was of her, and so my eyes shot around the room wildly, between the bodies of the men and women who just saved my life as they spoke slowly and loudly telling me I'd overdosed, and inquired as to whether I knew on what. Of course I knew, but I lied and said heroin. I made eye contact with her in that moment and my heart simultaneously sank and split in two. She held our cat, bobbing her up and down as you would a newborn to get them to sleep. In this case it was more likely an instinctual reaction to trauma. Like ventilation for excess, since her drenched eyes and cheeks suggested the normal avenues were well beyond capacity. I got up slowly against the resistance of the EMTs gently trying to push me back down into sitting position, telling me I need to take it easy. ""I need to hug her."" It felt stupid that I needed to state something that was so obvious to me. I felt like a fucking caveman using those words. As I got up and walked slowly toward her with someone's hand resting on my shoulder as if to make sure I don't take a spill, and also remind me that this ordeal isn't over, her body shudders and she bursts into tears. I take her in my arms and with my left hand I squeeze her head against my chest and my right around her waist, pulling her into me. 

""I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do. I panicked and I couldn't do the narcan. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,"" She cries out over and over again between gasps to breathe and helpless piercing cries that by this point made me lose my shit entirely. We both sobbing and apologizing profusely for a minute before I backed up and placed my hands on her cheeks in a futile attempt to wipe her tears away. In that moment I found myself meticulously savoring the shape of her face and the beautiful, glistening brown sorrow in her eyes. A sense of urgency struck me as if I'd never see her again, and a surge of panic cleared my foggy senses. I took this opportunity to calm myself, just long enough to memorize the  devastated expression on the face of the woman I love- the woman I'd just broken and lost forever in a way I didn't yet realize. My heart soaked up the guilt in these precious few seconds, where it hardened and eventually cracked, leaving me scarred and broken right along with her to this day. She finally looked me in the eyes. 

""I'm so sorry. Thank you for saving me. I don't want to die. I don't want to do this anymore. I love you. I love you."" I would have repeated the same few sentences ad nauseam if it weren't for the EMTs telling me it's time to go. I squeezed her one last time and said ""I love you.""

No wonder she left me.",1534418719.0

Reddit commentators quickly pointed out the irony that this test would just attract gays on both sides, tested and tester.

Well it strikes me that the more rules and regulations pain management clinics pile on patients, the only ones willing to submit to them or take the time and effort to study them and take it seriously are people who are hopelessly addicted or selling their script so they have a profit motive. Entire conduct guidebooks and rules you must follow, unwritten rules that depend on each location or even individual doctors, random drug tests you must do with an hours notice, pill counts, pill safes , required hours of physical therapy or alternative treatments, psychological counseling and it goes on and on. 

Actual patients in excruciating pain or end of life care or cancer patients ain't got time or brain power for all that, most of these people have trouble getting out of bed even with narcotics, and forget following byzantine rules or you're cut off. I've seen real human beings in stage four cancer on chemo or life ruining pain, these people are lucky to be functional enough to remember to carry their ATM card when they go out for fast food, and thats usually the big accomplishment of the week.

 I remember being so intensely jealous that people could wake up, *brush their teeth*, and **walk to the store**. Maybe humm a little song to themselves. Maybe get excited about something coming up in a few weeks. All of these normal people didn't realize how lucky they were to be able to feel good by such tiny things. And I remember this and believe that using was nothing but being nostalgic of past rewarding sobriety.

But those were just the bad times.

 I don't think I had any of those thoughts while high. Going to score dope was an amphetamine rush. Making the exchange was like crack. No shits to have while drawing up.  

There's no longing for normalcy when you're nodding so hard that you hit your head on your broken subwoofer and still not have a care in the world.

Whether you're deep in addiction or running the 12 steps, people are rarely happy.  When I'm hooked and feel like shit it seems salvation is in being clean.  When I'm clean and feel like shit it's obviously in being high.

Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
Prescription made...
Painkillers

Count your blessings early 
Before the lot will hit the gates
Winnings for the lucky living just takes 
Painkillers

Living just comes with a bit of heartache
Heartache comes with a bit of young faith
Faith stays young till your heart get broken
Hope grows up to become someday
I never hurt no one and no one will ever hurt me
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Faith plays dumb till the doubts all leave
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Manna won't fall till the people all speak
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Canaan ain't far for the souls who barter their pain for sweet relief

My queen won't feed on milk and honey
She impartial to the summer sun
She's a lone fire burning in the sand
And a cold, lonely night without one
She cocks her pistols 'fore she pops her collar
Oh she's all but lethal pulling off that laser gun
She's rips the halos off of angels for the fun of it
If all she ever does is smile at you, run
What'd ya need these for?
Round here the cries die young
Fly momma, fly to where you come
Speak momma, round here the quiet die young

Very lovely morning
Don't kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
And don't you ever pay mind to that line in your way that says you'll ruin it
You'll ruin this for everybody won't you
Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all the things you'll be missing
Prescription made

I am one of those people that are in the predicament of , being trapped in the Suboxone ""Opiate Addict"" cycle

And thats not saying that i am a opiate addict, drug user, etc. i am a user of buprenorphine . it doesnt matter the reason i started using it


On the way out of the doctors office, after the doctor had prescribed me Tramadol,he told me ""i do not want to give opiates to an opiate addict""

Why am i automatically grouped in with addicts because i seek pain relief?

This has happened to me quite a few times.

Some Doctors refer me to pain clinics, some doctors blatantly state they WILL NOT TREAT ME whatsoever . (With Narcotic or Non- Narcotic medicines)

My primary doctor now thinks im a drug addict cause' i take Bupe.

The people at the hospital, when i tell them 1 or 2mg of bupe, twice a day, they think i either take 8mg-2mg twice a day (i.e. 16mg of bupe) they think i am a hardcore drug addict

Suboxone initially probably did save my life but now all it does is get me high lol -_- . 

Suboxone is 25 to 50 times as strong as morphine
Buprenorphine used to be HIGHLY sought after in Europe , in rural areas 1 suboxone tablet selling for up to $120 each and is becoming the choice drug in jail aside from heroin etc. 

you see the people that takes opiates are usually in some sort of pain,
or even recreationally most people do not get addicted ...

How can some countries have opiates OTC, and others not?

The government does what the voters want us to do and because we all ramble on about how bad opioids are, they're getting banned .


When i was younger, i had no trouble getting scripts for low-dose oxy or hydrocodone. Now  i have to suck the doctor, nurse, pharmacist & insurance companies dick  .


When Obamacare came into play the new insurance tried to force suboxone strips on me (utter garbage)

When another new insurance bullshit came around, they tried that again, and then told them if they do not cover my Amneal Buprenorphine Tablet, {they are the closest thing to the original stop - sign orange suboxones} i will no longer use them, did they approve them . 


The pharmacist who has no right to talk to my mother about my medication {i honestly dont mind but jesus christ lol}, is telling her about how Soma will make me ""floaty and high"" (i no longer get my meds there, but i came to pick up my Soma there that one time . ) 
Soma is a joke ,
Flexirl is a joke,
NSAIDs are killing me
The only thing keeping me alive right now is drinking canned pears blended with broccoli through a straw . I can't even eat pussy or suck a dick . I have constant migraines, tension headaches and other migraine, neuralgia pain

Its just become very difficult for me after the Prescription Monitoring Program came into effect

Ive been dehumanized , demoralized, improperly treated, overdosed with various medications passed the daily allotment (i.e. the allotment for a day of Diclofenac is 200mg,,, which they had me on like 800 lol... and they did NOT care that it was burning a hole in my stomach)


Because i have yet to get my MRIs due to pain my Doctor would not write me a script for physical therapy so i could get some temporary pain relief

So now i understand why pain patients turn to heroin

I personally wont be turning to heroin, i have a lot of codeine and dihydrocodeine, but i dont really want to use them . I am trying to do things properly & by the doctor but this is now ongoing 6 years straight of being treated like shit by doctors.

My new primary doctor most likely will prescribe, but what the fuck? Our entire country is just naive . 

By the way - don't believe the overdose statistics on TV. that incorporates numbers of overdose deaths that INCLUDE things like antidepressants. 


i just am fed up . i may begin to use the code/dihydro and see where i get. the codeine i feel will not last long enough. i feel it might work, but not be strong enough.

(and yes, i know all about bupe tolerance, so i would not start a new regime like that without detoxing a little bit . i usually only take 1mg anyways)

Now, when i have pain, or i think about pain, i get overwhelmed with anxiety thinking about it . Its stupid and not fair . 

If the war on drugs was ended Mexico would be more stable because the majority of their income is literally from the sales of drugs to the united states which is why the narcos act as the government . and yea, blablabla",1534389071.0

I knew it was definitely more effective than snorting the ECP I get around here, but still, my butthole has been pristine and unpenetrated for all of the years I have lived on this fine earth. But for some reason today was the perfect storm of cirumstances.

I was driving home from dropping off my girlfriend who lives about a half an hour away from where I stay. I was excited to get home because I had about half of a bundle left over at my house and nothing to do tomorrow morning. But, as a snorter, I was annoyed as my allergies had been acting up and since I can only use one of my nostrils in the first place, it was going to be annoying as fuck to get noddin' away. 

Then a voice, a mere whisper, ran through my mind. Almost like an ethereal, echoing voice of god, or at least god played by Morgan Freeman: *Use the butthole.*

My junkie senses tingled, and I remembered I had a few bucks to spare for the week after a hefty paycheck last week. I drove to my local CVS before I got home. Distracted by the holy voice still recounting the magic that I had learned from this sub could be accessed through... well... my ""holy,"" I got to the checkout counter. A pretty girl around my age asked me what I was doing tonight. Me being an awkward dumbass lost in thought about the sweet glory of pumping hard drugs into my anus like basting a turkey, I just spat out ""its for my dog"" (?), grabbed the change from her hand and left.

A quick google search and I found the guide that I read in that same voice, and fast forward to now: I have finally defiled my precious rectum and am high as FUCK as a reward for my sins.

This was an utter nonsense way to tell this story but boofing is definitely the shit. Nod on, fuckers!",1534384439.0

.....​​

Reggie and I met one night in Matts tiny room, through Amy. Reggie was tall and skinny like me, and when I told him I was trying to buy an 8 ball of powder he offered to source it for me. I rode with him and Jimmy, a short portuguese guy with a high pitched voice, to a bar in an old train car a few miles from Matts house. Reggie went in with my cash and came back to the truck with exactly what i asked for. I put the bag on my scale on the floor of the track and weighed it; 3.5 grams. “See kid? I told you, I dont fuck people. Im good people bro, you’ll see” Reggie said. “Yeah, it weighs, but I wont know what it is until we get back and I drop it in the water. I gotta see how she swims first.” I countered, and Reggie knew I was right. 
​​When we got to Matts, I cooked up a half gram in a spoon, testing the quality, and it was good.
​​I handed Reggie a fat crack rock and said “Tell me what you think, I want your opinion”. 
​​Reggie loaded it into his glass stem and brought it to his lips, puffing and twisting as he licked the flame onto the crack ever so gently, like a true professional. Watching him smoke, I immediately knew he was no stranger to cocaine, maybe even more experienced than me. I had only been smoking coke for 2 years, and before that, I had only sniffed powder maybe 20 times in my life. Sniffing was cool but I never liked how much it fucked up my nostrils, or the way I would claw at the bedsheets as the sun came up, unable to sleep or get comfortable enough to relax. Smoking coke, however, was entirely different for me. The high was powerful, euphoric, even sexual, and it was short lived. I could smoke coke and eat pizza at the same time. I could fall asleep with ease after smoking, sometimes I had even slept holding the pipe in my hand. I didnt crave it when it was gone, moreover, I could actually sleep with it in my pocket, if I wanted or needed to. It took discipline, but sometimes that coke I had was my only way of earning any cash, and so smoking it was out of the question. Sure, Id think about it, wanting to get high. But I figured if I was unable to control myself, I was nothing more than a feen and a crackhead, and I didnt want to be that. So I learned to hustle, hold work, make moves, and survive. I was always going to survive. That much was certain.
​​
​​Reggie finished hitting the pipe, closed his eyes as he held it in, exhaled a giant plume of acrid smoke, opened his eyes and starred at me for a moment, unable to speak. I began to chuckle. 
​​“I know that look” I said. 
​​“Kid, holy fuck. HOLY FUCK. Yo you really just cooked this shit?!” Reggie said, in disbelief. 
​​There were 4 or 5 other people in Matts room, plus Amy, Matt, and EC, a point guard I played basketball with on my JV high school team. The room hushed, everyone stopping their conversations to see what Reggie was “Holy Fuck”-ing about. 
​​“Yo this kid is a fucking GENIUS! He is a beast! Bro you gotta cook my shit for me!” he said, taking a bag out of his pocket and handing it to me. 
​​From that moment on, I was no longer the “new kid” in the homeless food chain. I was the chef, and it was not long before my name was ringing in the streets. I also was no longer homeless, technically. Reggie found out I was on the street and immediately told me I was always welcome to crash at his baby moms crib, up in the apartments on Independence Drive. 
​​“What apartments on Independence?” I asked. “I never heard of nothing up there but Shepleys and the spot where them kids burned and buried that body.”
​​“Oh yeah kid! Two apartment buildings, 3 stories tall. You’ll see.” he said.
​​
​​Reggie and I got close. Reggie had the gift of gab, like me. He could finesse you and get you to do what he wanted, whether you knew it or not. He liked me because I was honest and I was real, not pretending to be a hustler like so many of the kids on Cape Cod. I had been places, traveled, lived and worked elsewhere. So had he. We had a lot in common. 
​​In high school Reggie had been a track star. He could run like the fucking wind. He was so fast and had so much stamina, he was also famous for outrunning every cop that had tried to chase him on foot. I shit you not, one night he and I were smoking coke in a shitty hotel room up near the mall, and we decided we wanted another half gram to smoke. But neither of us had a ride to go get it, and the dealer was about 2 miles from us down Route 28. Reggie said “Fuck it, I’ll run.” And he got up, left the room, and ran to the crack man, bought the half gram, and ran back. It took him all of 25 minutes. I was impressed. 
​​Reggie had Jacob, his son, with Patty, their only child. Patty, Jacob, and Pattys two adult children from her previous marriage, Geoffrey and Courtney, lived in a 3 bedroom apartment in Independence Park. Literally the only apartment “high-rises” on cape cod, there were two buildings at the time, each 3 stories, each floor holding like 8 apartments. All in all, probably about 50 units. The apartments were brand new, and I started living there with them full time, first on the floor in the living, then on the couch, then eventually in Geoff and Jacob’s room.
​​
​​There were two Amys I met in Hytown. Amy my street mom was first. Later, right around the beginning of May, Reggie and I walked down past the high school to a row of condos where Amy #2 lived. 
​​Amy #2 was a petite blond in her early 30s. From the outside, her condo looked really nice, and I was intrigued to see the inside and meet this girl when we walked up the driveway. Reggie opened the screen door, knocked, and then announced himself as he opened the actual door and walked into the living room. I followed behind, slowly and cautiously. Reggie was street smart, and he could fight, but sometimes he was too focused on getting high, and he moved sloppy. I was always careful, moving with more purpose, constantly on alert. I knew how things could happen. I had been in some situations that almost cost me my life, and some that almost cost me my freedom, and a few where I narrowly escaped with both. 
​​“Amy!!! Where you at girl!” Reggie yelled, coming back out of the kitchen and bounding up the stairs to the second floor. I just chilled in the living room, standing next to the fireplace where I could see both doors, front and back. 
​​“Im up here” I heard a muffled voice squeal, in a very valley girlish tone.
​​Eventually Reggie and Amy came down and he introduced us. 
​​“So, he said you wanted some dope, right?” she asked me as we sat down at her dining room table. 
​​“Yeah, he told me you had a plug for some flame - you got a tester though?” I asked.
​​“Whats a tester?” she said, looking at me puzzled. 
​​I sighed, and said “Look, I’m not buying shit until I see what it is.” 
​​Amy scoffed, and then stalled a few minutes, waiting to see if I would break and give up my cash without a fuss. I didnt say another word. Reggie eventually took the cue.
​​“He has the cash Aim, he isnt a junkie shitbox. He spends bread and he moves work, I have been with him, this kid is a hustler.” 
​​Amy looked at me again, stood up and went upstairs. A few minutes later she returned with a bag of brown powder. 
​​“This what it looks like. Check it out.” she said, handing it to me. 
​​I opened it up and smelled it: vinegar filled my nostrils. I kept my poker face on, but inside I was jumping up and down with excitement. This was real dope, not fentanyl cut into powdered sugar. 
​​“Yeah, it looks straight” I said. I handed her $50, and she immediately barked out “But you are going to hook me up too, right!?!?”
​​I nodded in confirmation. “I’m never stingy.”
​​
​​Amy got her bag of brand new needles and handed one to me. Reggie piped in “I want one too kid.”
​​I looked up at him in disbelief. Reggie didnt have a dope habit. He loved cocaine even more than I did, but he never really got into opiates. 
​​“Bro are you serious?” I asked, confused. 
​​“Absolutely! I do it every once in a while, just not often, so I dont catch a habit.”
​​I scooped about a point of dope into Reggie’s spoon, and a point into Amy’s. 
​​“Is that straight” I asked Amy, and she nodded in agreement. 
​​I scooped about double what I gave them into my spoon. 
​​I had been sniffing pills and heroin for almost 20 years, but I hadn’t injected anything until about 3 days previous. Actually, the day Sean beat me for my $40, I shot up a suboxone strip in the bus station bathroom. That was my first injection. I had always been vehemently against using needles, but homeless and broke and dope sick, I felt like it didnt matter anymore. When you go to the hospital, does the doctor give you medicine orally because thats the best route of administration? No, they put a butterfly in your arm and inject it into your blood stream. 
​​Its not so much the injecting of drugs that is so bad, its so much of the shit associated with injecting. Like not knowing what your doing for example, when you first start with the needle. 
​​Amy looked over at my spoon and saw my cotton. 
​​“Are you serious! Hahahaha! Look at the size of this kids cotton!!!” she scoffed. 
​​“What the fuck is wrong with my cotton?” I shot back.
​​“I mean its fucking HUGE dude!” she said. “Do you even know what your doing?”
​​Reggie jumped in “He just started a few days ago shooting. He’s still learning, Aim. Dont be a bitch.”
​​My cotton was huge. I was terrified of getting a particle in my needle. Funny how those fears dissipated over time. A few months later I was shooting everything I came across; coke, crack, MDMA, amphetamine salt, morphine, hydromorphone, the list goes on.
​​“What the fuck ever” I mumbled, drawing the dope water into my needle. “Mind your business.”
​​I tied off my arm and started to do my shot. I hit first, which was funny since I was the newbie. Shortly after, Reggie asked Amy to help him. 
​​“Will you fix this for me Amy, I cant fucking do it.” 
​​“Sure I got you honey” Amy said and she took his rig, pulled the dope water into it from his spoon, and flicked it, checking it in the light above the table.
​​“Can you hit me too?” Reggie asked. 
​​I finished my shot as she began to do Reggie’s for him. The dope was good, really good. I was soaking in a warm bath of honey and back rubs from naked nympho angels. I lit a cigarette and watched Amy stick Reggie and plunge the entire shot into his arm. As I watched her plunge the shot, I realized how dark and brown the water was, and how much of it was in the needle. Looked to me like almost 100 cc’s, a GIANT shot for someone who only does heroin every once in a while. 
​​She stepped back from Reggie and sat back down in her seat, and Reggie’s eyes were closed. His head immediately tilted back and I knew that something was not right.
​​Amy was sitting with her legs crossed in her chair,  searching her thighs for a place to inject her shot. 
​​“Amy where is the Narcan I asked you about?” I said, my voice tense. “Something aint right. Reggie! YO! YO REG!” I yelled, standing up out of my chair.
​​“Hes fine. Relax. Chill the fuck out man.” Amy said, not even looking up from her legs. 
​​“No, hes not.” I barked, as I made my way around the table to Reggie. He was gargling and his eyes were rolled all the way back in his head. I shook him. I slapped his face. I threatened him.
​​Panic and adrenaline arrived, and now I was getting serious. 
​​“Amy, WHERE IS THE NARCAN.” I demanded. 
​​“I dont know man, fucking chill out, I’ll find it when I’m done doing my shot.” she said, still searching her thighs for a spot to do her shot. 
​​“BITCH. I will fucking take your shit and slap the fuck out of you. Get the narcan RIGHT NOW. Dont fucking test me. You dont know me.” my voice low and calm. 
​​Amy threw her needle down onto the table in front of her, jumping up out of her chair. 
​​“Oh my god, fine, you fucking asshole. Jesus christ, fucking newbies.” she said as she walked into the kitchen, reached on top of the fridge, and grabbed two narcan nasal spray kits. 
​​“Here, are you happy now?” she said as she handed them to me. 
​​Reggie wasnt breathing. His lips were getting blue. He was foaming a little out of the crease of his mouth.
​​I hadnt ever seen an overdose before. I hadnt ever used narcan either. I ripped open one of the boxes, and assembled it as quickly as I could read the directions. I put the tip in Reggie’s nostril and squeezed it down. WOOOSH, a big spritz of narcan liquid right up his left nostril. I stepped back and he coughed a bit, his head no longer laying back limp. I prepared to hit his right nostril with another spritz, but suddenly he opened his eyes and starred at me, looking dazed and confused. 
​​“Bro, you fucking OD’ed” I said, and I let out a long sigh of relief.
​​“What dude? Thats fucking crazy….” he said, looking around trying to get his bearings. 
​​“And this bitch was gonna let you die.” I said, pointing at Amy. She was still searching for a vein. 
​​“No I wasn’t motherfucker!” she protested. “You were overreacting! He was FINE! He was just nodded out!” 
​​“Yeah, nodded out and not breathing right?” I countered. 
​​“Really kid, I wasnt breathing?” Reggie asked. 
​​“Your lips were blue.” I said, matter of factly. “She just didnt want to be interrupted, she hasnt gotten her shot.”
​​Reggie looked at Amy and shook his head in disgust.
​​“WOW” he said. “Just…. WOW.”
​​Amy never looked up, she just kept looking at her legs, searching for a vein.
​​
​​Its fair to say Amy #2 was someone I had no respect for, for reasons I think are obvious. But her roommate was the source of the heroin, and it was fire, so I ended up going to Amy’s condo a lot. Reggie liked Amy but I didnt understand why. It wasnt for her looks. She was that type of girl who was probably really hot in high school and then got turned out on drugs in her expensive college. She would shoot cocaine and stand in her bathroom for insane periods of time, picking at her face. Some people are pickers, not just meth heads. Its a horrible “geek” to have, in my opinion. Her face was constantly covered in scabs and bleeding holes. As was the majority of her limbs. 
​​I learned that Amy’s father was how she afforded the condo. He paid for everything. He would come by once a week, the same day and time , for 10-15 minutes. His visit was really just to hand Amy cash for the week. The rest of the bills he took care of without her participation. Her “roommate” was really just her drug dealer, living in the second bedroom, for free. He would sell her the coke and dope when she had money, and when she was out, he would crumb her with just enough to keep her from going ape shit. I never actually saw his face, which was something I respected. Smart not to be seen. 
​​
​​A few weeks later, Reggie and I were out running together as usual, and we ended up at Amy’s for some reason, I cant remember why. Once we got there, we wanted to smoke crack, so I told Reggie to see if Amy could get us a $40 piece. 
​​Amy told us that she had to order it, her roommate wasn’t home. So she made a call and we sat downstairs waiting. When dude arrived, Amy was upstairs in her bathroom, like always, and dude didnt even look in our direction as he ran up the stairs to her. Later, he ran back down the stairs and out the front door. Reggie and I looked at each other, and then we both stood up and headed upstairs to find out what had happened to our $40. We found Amy in her bathroom. 
​​“Whats up?” Reggie asked her. “Did you get it?”
​​“Yeah, here you go.” she said, handing him a folded piece of paper. 
​​He opened it up and looked at the contents, and then looked at me. 
​​“What….” I asked, peering into the fold. It was about $5 worth of crack, if that. Definitely NOT $40 worth, not even $20. What was in the paper was enough for one person to smoke a half hit, basically a giant tease and not even worth doing.
​​“No, this is not going fly” I said to Amy. “Not even fucking close Amy. Give me my shit. You do not want to try this game with me, you will lose, I’m trying to tell you.” 
​​“Thats all they gave me!!! What do you want me to do?!!?” Amy yelled, slamming her tweezers onto the bathroom counter. “I mean I cant force him to give me more, can I?”
​​“You could have called us upstairs before he walked out the door Amy.” I said. “You know Im not letting this ride. You can either call him back here, or you can give me my $40 back and keep this crumb you are trying to give me. One way or another though, I’m getting whats mine.”
​​“I cant call him back here, he doesnt have a phone!” she screamed, and I knew then she was trying to game me. I started to pace and noticed something sitting on the hamper full of dirty clothes. It was a brand new iPhone 6, like BRAND NEW. The 6 had just come out that same week. Again, Amy’s father.
​​“Ok well if you are gonna rob me then I guess I have no choice” I said, picking up the iPhone and showing her I had it in my hands. “Fuck it, I bet this is worth more than $40 anyway.” I said, as I started walking out the bathroom to the stairs. “Reg, we out.” I yelled.
​​“NO!!” Amy screamed, chasing behind me. “GIVE THAT BACK!”
​​“Not until you give me my money or my work Amy, I’m not playing with you” I said. 
​​“FINE ASSHOLE…. “ she said, reaching into her bra and pulling a baggie out. She handed me the baggie and I looked at it closely. “Its all there asshole” she hissed.
​​I handed her the iPhone and started making my way out of the house. 
​​“Im gonna call the cops on you, you fucking ASSHOLE!” she yelled after us. 
​​“Yeah, you do that you dumb bitch.” I said as I opened the screen door and walked out, Reggie behind me. 
​​
​​“What in the actual fuck bro…” I said, turning to Reggie as we hustled down the driveway into the foggy night. In my backpack I had a stolen .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver. In my nut sack I had a large quantity of ECP, probably around 10 grams, what we called a stick in the commonwealth.

He doesn't have a car, but has a lot of errands to run so every morning we send a text asking if he needs anything today and at any point in the day if he needs something (considering we're not already busy of course) we drive over and usually end up spending the day with him. We'll run and do whatever he needs, then we chill at his place for hours and hours, watching movies, doing lines, whatever. 

Awhile back we had a scare where he asked us to run something to his girl. He hands me a grocery bag and we run it down, but later that day he called accusing us of stealing from him. Apparently he wrapped it up a certain way and it wasn't the same when she got it. We explained we'd never do that, but told him if something is missing we may have dropped it or whatever, we'd pay for whatever was gone, but we promised we didn't steal (we didn't even open the bag). After told him that he believed us and now we're cool again. 

Today my best friend was sick as fuck and has to work tonight, I was trying to help him out but we don't get paid till tonight (technically it's tomorrow at 1-2AM but still) and he doesn't get paid til Friday. Today J called us over cause he needed us to send his ex-wife some money (he can't use WU or anything on his own because he sent some other people money so much they thought he was laundering money) and get his dry cleaning. We went and did that and after when we got back I asked if it'd be possible to get a front to help out our friend. Before I was even able to finish asking he grabbed his shit and started pulling out a .5. I started to explain that I'll pay him tonight and my friend will pay me back later right away he stopped me a said ""y'all don't need to go through all this explaining and shit. Some people gotta explain but not y'all. Do you need something for yourselves too?"" 

Only reason I'm making this post is because it's a nice feeling to be able to have a dealer like this when all I hear from friends or read on here is people getting fucked or having to bend over backwards to get their shit.

Edit: Figured I'd add some clarification because of the criticisms of our actions here

1. We *NEVER* do anything we don't want to. Multiple times we've been asked to run drugs somewhere and we say no (with no argument from J) every time because we're not comfortable having drugs in the car with us (the only time we have dope in the car is on the way home after a pick-up)

2. The Western Union isn't going to some random person for some random reason. It always goes to his Ex-wife to help her take care of his son. Also important to say that we knew her for years before we ever met him, and I had sent her money through WU at least twice before we even knew J.

3. J never carries *ANYTHING* illegal in the car. I'm not saying this just because I trust his word and he says he's clean, I *know* this for a fact. 

4. We're not being manipulated into doing anything. There are plenty of times we're unavailable or don't want to go anywhere and don't help when he needs it. He's okay with this. To us it's no different than helping your buddy run errands while his car is in the shop, just not temporary. 

5. We are compensated *very* well for what we do. To some, a G might not seem worth it, but when a G lasts you 2 or 3 days, and you're getting a G at the very least every other day, it supports your entire habit (we literally haven't paid for dope in 3 months. Not once). Also no matter how much or how little driving we do, if we drive him somewhere, we leave with a full gas tank. On top of all of that, when we're done with errands, we go to his place, do lines, watch movies, eat his food, smoke his cigarettes, etc and just hang out with him. 

6. No he isn't fucking my fiance. ",1534375013.0

I am a pain patient and normally take about 90 10/325 vicodon a month (rx'ed 120,but since on Cymbalta I've cut back a lot),   25mcg fentanyl patches,  and 120mg Cymbalta.  

I normally get rid of 30-45 of my hydrocodone a month to my guy that trades me various other stuff ie: blow,  kitties,  or Molly etc.  Sometimes because I will delay in replacing my patch in time,  I have an extra 1-2patches at end of month that I trade as well. 

Anyhow,  my brother passed away and I was really disorganized and had a box of my patches in my back seat.  I only gave ""my guy""  rides the day they vanished and knew he took em. Anyhow he never owned up to it,  but said he felt badly for me (yeah total bs but whatever too late now) he gave me about 60mg of methadone that I slowly used over like 3days which helped wd's but I was still in agony from pain. 
He has offered to get me another 200mg bottle of methadone or offered me heroine,  which I initially refused. 
Since I am in severe withdrawals now,  I am considering everything but only want enough to get me through the next two weeks until I get me new scripts.  Since in severe pain and withdrawals,  I am eating through my hydrocodone way too fast now and only have like 25 left. 
After I get my scripts I am done with him and not ever gonna get rid of my extra again.  
What would you suggest I get from him to get me through the next two weeks?

Thank you for your time posting and responding. Withdrawals are the fucking worst.

I know that they aren't opiates but I myself, and many others seem to be getting these prescribed more and more lately with their opiates. Always good to know about any interactions and such.

Which of these has less side effects or adverse affects. Which one is more dangerous in the short term, long term, etc.

I know most people prefer the effects of pregabalin over gabapentin and I myself have only tried gabapentin and think its ok recreationally. My goal is not necessarily the one that feels better but rather the one that is least toxic or damaging to my body.

I know that they both can have a ton of weird side effects and thats why I'm asking. Is one more likely to cause ulcers, or liver damage, kidney damage, heart problems, etc. I have a bunch of stomach issues so knowing which one is harder on the stomach would be helpful. Basically I want to minimize the harm I cause myself by taking one of these with my subs or alone. They really seem to help my anxiety so I'd like to stick with whichever is the least toxic. Thanks!

I then was on kratom during this time off street drugs, which is such a shitty habit, I have tapered down to less than a gram and almost am ready to say goodbye to it too. Last night I had a dream I found some old paraphenelia caked in this fire purple heroin I once copped off DNMs and I tried scraping it off to snort and it got mixed with plastic scrapings, etc, and I just have up. 

I saw my ex dealer and did not even think of copping, i see all the people on the streets i used to go to to cold cop and even when i feel down i dont want to grab. My pain issues are finally getting better slowly (i made no progress while using for a variety of reasons), and i am starting to get my brain back-- i never realized how dumb street drugs made me. I can think clearly now and feel like i, escaping the black grips of this affliction. 

Beyond all that, i still have some deep admiration for the drug. I came to hate street drugs (cut up poisoned fentanyl shit), not HEROIN, which is still such a beautiful molecule to me. I cannot say I will never use again, but I will never buy a street drug from a dealer and go into that world, if i can help it. 

The main lesson I learned is that 90% of my excess misery, my health problems, family, financial, everything, was the result of using street drugs. I am convinced if I had had access to pharma grade sterile heroin I would have been far safer, happier, healthier. This past years of my life redpilled me on so much, on society, law and order, attitudes, fairweather friends, etc. I honestly am almost thankful to have gone through it but I know that is rationalizing wasted time. 

I am glad to be free of that shit, but at the same time, I am almost giddy at thinking of how amazing the poppy flower is. Truly given to us by a compassionate God, only humans took it and mutated it into a black tentacled fuck like humans always tend to do. So when I see the 12 steppers, the NA freaks preaching their bullshit about drugs are bad mmmkay and how we are all powerless, I see that as just another fault of human concious. To me, these people view the drug in a box corrupted by societial influence and self hate.

There was “Life After Heroin” and “Life After Heroin 2: Still Kickin’” and I felt like today was a good day to do a third installment. Today marks 2 years since I have last used heroin. So let’s dive right in!!!

Life has been really good as of late... my son is 14 months old, and getting bigger every day. He is so much fun and we do everything together. We just went to Ocean City, Maryland last week with the family and we had an amazing time. My family life has been great, especially with my beautiful fiancé. My band is doing great, too. We played our first festival and had an awesome time. I been playing Fortnite lol (groundTERRAPIN on PS4) but I just cut down. I was going hard on it playing all day, every day. Now I play like a round or two a day. Lol also cut down heavily on scratch offs.

Drug wise, I still smoke bud. I been vaping oils more than smoking buds, but it’s like the same thing. I also take psychedelics or adderall occasionally, but I haven’t touched crack, coke, or meth or any other hard drugs in a long, long time. Drinking, I can take it or leave it. I have a few here and there when I’m out and it’s there. I’m down to 48mg a day with the methadone, and dropping. I been on a taper from 53mg and I’m coming down 2mg every 2 weeks as of right now. So pretty soon I’ll be off that, too. Life is good.

If I can get off dope, anyone can. I was a straight heroin/crack addict and I thought I’d never stop. I thought I’d die an addict. And I almost did, thanks be to God I got a second chance. I almost didn’t take the second chance either. So glad I did. Life can be amazing if you let it. Anyone struggling, hit me up. You can message me on here, or look me up on Facebook, Sam Grippit and I’ll do my best to help you. Thanks for reading!!! ",1534348116.0

Going to a music festival and worried about #4 powder being destroyed in a hot car.,"So im going to a music festival this weekend and im mortified about the possibility of my stash getting destroyed in the heat. This is a camping festival so i was planing on locking anything valuable in the car instead of just putting it in my tent and hoping no sneaky hippies raid my tent during the music.

My friend and i have about 10 bundles of number 4 heroin to use and enjoy throughout the weekend. If we lock it in the car with 90 degree weather, naturally the car is going to bake like an oven with the windows all shut, will the dope survive? should we be worried about it clumping into useless junk or worse off?

I was thinking of putting it in an airtight mason jar to avoid humidity exposure, what do you think? Thank you for your time and consideration. Need some veteran advise on this one, please help if you can!

TLDR: would #4 heroin be safe in an airtight mason jar locked inside of a car in 90 degree weather for the weekend? or would it be destroyed? What would you do in my situation, camping at a music festival for the weekend.

But as the years when by the popularity increased and so did the demand. When the increased amount of arcade machines brought in were the same one, or a little different, more and more people waiting in line to play, then came the price increase. Sometimes the game was out of order and waiting to be repaired. As we all slowly ran out of money and scrambled to find more to keep playing and keep up with the increase in price it became harder and harder. So we decided to take breaks whether it was forced upon us by being incarcerated from stealing, or the arcade closing at night, or even loved ones telling us to come home. At night we would dream of continuing on the quest for the high score, some of us knowing we'd never beat it or even reach it. I didn't choose to quit playing I just ran out of cash and I'm waiting to play again. Other people begging for change, I'm one of the lucky ones to have a job and can get my moment in the sun once more. But life goes on without us so we have to keep the steady pace and hope alive otherwise we too will be swept under the rug. So here I sit, waiting for Friday to finally come and to let me revisit the arcade at least one more time, because all we have is right now and tomorrow is a different day. ",1534342939.0

If you buy street heroin in the united states (mostly ecp from the eastern side of the u.s.) youve probably gotten the bad/fake dope that feels like a trippy/very intense weed high. 

Well after a lot of people did the same batch in philly, and a shitload of them ended up in the hospital, they tested the dope and found that it had synthetic cannabis/k2/spice in the dope.

That dope with spice in it does not feel good, it does not relieve wd symptoms, and when i got it a dozen different times it made me trip so bad that i shouldve been in the e.r. 

Its been showing up in dope for the past 3 years now that ive experienced, and the people making or cutting the dope must think they are making the dope feel stronger by adding that shit into it. Maybe if everyone that buys dope would tell their dealer whats been happening, it might go up the chain of dealers until it gets to the people responsible for putting it in. If they dont already know its bad and ruins the dope completely, maybe if enough people tell em they wont use it anymore.

At least alert all the other addicts you know about whats happening, and to start slow with new batches so us users dont die from that shit. Its gotta be lethal to inject too much spice, and i doubt theres anything the e.r. could even do for a spice overdose. All i know is that shit is horrible.

Is it worth IV this? He said ms the rush is comparable to coke, but somehow more intense. Should I smoke it? or IV it? I never IVed crack, just smoked. But in my head IV crack should be equal to cocaine, because is literally cocaine.

A gram is around $450aus or $325usd. I do not know anyone in person I can buy from either which means I’m at the mercy of the onion farmers.

I feel like I have no hope, and may as well try something extreme.  I think medications typically used for anxiety are bullshit, and they always end up making me feel worse in the long run.

Rufus and I tore into it every time we woke up from a nod. Worse than that though between the two of us, one would always brag about the quality. If he didn’t brag about how good our dope was to some poor street junkie cooking up the typical vinegary, black goo in the bottom half of a coke can or spoon on the sidewalk, then I did. We traded hits for packs of cigarettes or five bucks or meth we didn’t really want or pills we didn’t need. So, sooner than it should have been, it was gone.

The morning after it ran out we sat in the park and did some of the dilaudid and morphine we’d obtained. It was the last day of the month. We’d have food stamps to trade soon, but until then, we would be bored and wait for someone to come along with a lick for us to hit or something to pass the time. Soon enough, Black Irish walked up to us.

Now, Black Irish was neither black nor was he Irish, at least not so far as I could tell. He looked like a Nazi after the war who had let his hair grow out. Our interaction with him was always the same. He offered us rancid protein shakes in bottles he’d purchased at 42 cents a bottle from the discount grocery store, where a package of deli cut turkey breast might look more like a package of green roast beef. That was Black Irish’s thing. Well, it was one of his things.

He also liked to tell people how much he loved them. Sometimes, he would mix his proclamation of love towards you in with veiled threats to your safety, but he said it a lot. It was part of the Christian community he was in and out of it so frequently, a rehab church. He was a self-appointed leader there and disciple maker when he wasn’t relapsing. Eventually, he started saying that he’d been called to teach other men how to relapse and come back from it. Black Irish was always angry, walking around with two clenched fists like hammer heads and gritting his teeth, but out of some religious duty, he always told us he loved us. 

Rufus and I had just lit cigarettes. Black Irish stood at our feet looking down at us. He eyed our cigarettes and licked his lips. His fists clenched, and he said,

“Hey, guys. I love you.”

“Hey, Black Irish.” We responded trying to hide our disappointment in having to talk to him.

“How’s it going?”

“We’re doing alright.” I never asked him how he was.

“Good. I’m happy for you. Well, yeah, I’m doing pretty good myself.” I rolled my eyes. I didn’t want to know. “Just, you know, got back to my ministry at Hope Outreach downtown.”

“Yeah. We know where it is.”

“Good. Good. You guys should come down sometime. I sure do love you guys. Would love to see you come in and come to a service.” He grunted as the visceral hatred he held in his guts towards us tried to escape his mouth. “Really…really love you guys.”

“Maybe. Yeah. You know, what? That sounds nice. Maybe we’ll come see you there soon.” Rufus piped in.

“Okay! Looking forward to it.”

“Okay.”

“Hey. I have a pair of movie tickets here, but I can’t go to it. I've got work. Would you guys want to go see it?” Black Irish was always fasting from food or subjecting himself to humiliating employment as penance he decided God had decided for him to do. It never made sense. That’s how it was with him, though.

“Guess so. What is it?”

“Something about a mine in Alaska or something and women being mistreated there.”

“Jeesh. A lighthearted flick, huh?”

“Here.” He handed us the tickets. “Love you guys. See ya.”

“K. See ya.” Rufus said.

We walked up to the movie theater. The entrance was part of an outdoor plaza in the mall. There was a large grassy hill where people sat. Kids played with bouncy balls, and parents lay on blankets. Rufus busted out a sticky brown roach and lit it. He took a few puffs, blew the smoke up and passed it to me.

“Maybe we shouldn’t smoke here. There’s kids.”

“Nah..” He was holding the smoke in and talking. “Nah. Just smoke it. We’ll be done in a second.”

I shrugged. I took a few puffs. Before I could pass it back, I realized the smoke was blowing right towards the families and their kids. Rufus busted up in a fit of coughing. I followed, watery snot spraying out of my nose with the thick grey smoke plumes.  It burned like fire in the back of my nostrils.  We coughed hard. The parents of the children looked at us and shook their heads.

Eventually, we stopped coughing and walked into the theatre. A nerdy high school kid took our tickets and told us where the auditorium was. We had no money for soda and popcorn or any of that, but we did have a 200 milligram Kadian. Rufus and I went to the bathroom. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and took the cellophane off it. I opened the turquoise gel cap and poured the time release beads into the clear plastic that Rufus was holding open. He pulled out his lighter and crushed the beads against the stall divider. We poured the granulated powder into a cooker, dropped water on it and sucked it back up, half and half.

A flower of black blood bloomed through the milky morphine mixture in my syringe and disappeared back into the vein from which it came. We grunted simultaneously at the rush. I rubbed my face and capped my rig. It wasn’t a new one, so the needle got caught on the orange plastic cap and bent badly. Rufus watched it happen.

“Dang! Looks like that one’s spent.”

“Yeah. Huh? I’ve used worse.” There were at least six broken needles in my arms. There were seven before that. One had worked itself to the surface so that I could pick it out. The thing is that when they break and you try to grab them, your skin and fat pushes back up and swallows it before you can get it. I smiled and shrugged, dramatically throwing it into the toilet before I flushed it. We laughed and walked out.

In the theater, Rufus found a half-eaten box of popcorn that was cold and soggy. He also rounded up a few old beverages people left behind and mixed them together in the biggest cup. Rufus said it was flat and watery, maybe a mixture of Sprite, root beer and diet Coke. He wasn’t sure. But took long pulls of it through the straw between chewing the popcorn. The trailers started.

I always liked trailers more than movies. They were shorter. They were more action packed and emotionally stirring than the actual feature films. In high school, I realized that movies worth watching were few and far between. Movies didn’t do it for me. Most of the time, I was rooting for the good guys to fail and die so I could just go home and start mourning the $11.50 I’d wasted to see it as soon as possible. The sooner I started grieving it, the sooner I’d be over it.

Cinematic features had other problems, though, in my eyes. They were terribly unrealistic. And even when the storylines were relatable, I couldn’t stop thinking about how the actors were just acting. I’d heard about how partnerships or love stories on screen were actually terrible rivalries behind the scenes. They weren’t friends or in love. Like my life back when I used to go to the movies, before I went back to the streets, it was all fake. That was the most realistic thing about it. People pretended to be friends. They pretended to care. They pretended their lives mattered, and as I sat there watching that movie with Rufus, this was what I thought about. I didn’t have to worry about him being fake. He was broken like me. He stunk like me. He was filthy like me, but Rufus was also real. Rufus was my friend. He slept through the whole thing.

When we got out of the movie we walked up to see Ally Alcoholic. She was sitting on her bench. Rufus was getting sweet on her like he always did. He asked her if she had a clean, which she did. She gave it over, and we walked back to the spot to do whatever pill we decided to when we got there. It hit me then, the things I’d forgotten for over a week. I needed to break it to Rufus that he had to stop talking to her. I wondered how’d he take it. Would he accept it? He had to, or we’d be in big trouble. There was no second option. The Faceless One had ordered it.",1534282966.0
97cfzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/97cfzd/soo_last_week_i_got_kicked_out_of_rehab_for/,17,https://redd.it/97cfzd,mashnote,"Soo last week I got kicked out of rehab for withdrawing too hard. :| sent to jail, motion to revoke probation... anyone experienced something similar/have any idea what might happen to me?","Ok so. I'm hoping my fellow junkies here have maybe been in similar programs and have some idea of how this all might play out. Really if anyone can shed some light, any light, on this clusterf-k predicament... I'd be so grateful... Sorry about the wall of text, it's really a lot of details over a simple thing, just trying not to miss anything...

Last Nov I committed a serious crime for which I am genuinely remorseful. Drove drunk and crashed into an empty parked vehicle - no one was hurt thank god, and insurance covered property damage. This is my 2nd DWI; first was 8 years ago. I pled into ""DWI Court"" which is like a modified probation focused on I guess addiction recovery. It begins with a three month intensive outpatient program - group therapy 9 hours a week, going before the judge every week, etc... and of course random UAs. I have had a serious speedball addiction for a couple years now, so... I pissed dirty... 

They had me sign an agreement saying that I was not to use substances any more, and start having individual sessions with their assigned therapist in addition to everything else, and so on... Long story short I'm a complete idiot and piss dirty a second time at the end of the week. Come Monday my probation officer tells me to get to evening group early in order to drop another UA, because ""in light of the 2nd positive UA, the office will be making a recommendation to the judge, and if this UA comes out negative it will be one thing, if it comes positive it will be something else"". Welp that did it, 3rd positive UA...

So the next day I have court, got to go before the judge. Before court commences, the court officer pulls me aside for a private meeting. She tells me that because of what I'm dirty for (opiates), they're very worried about me. I start crying saying I don't want to be a criminal and I'm very sorry for my actions and want to do what it takes not to do something hurtful like that again (all true)... she tells me it's not even the criminal aspect they're concerned about at this point, it's my health and safety. Says they're referring me to the county-run rehab for a 5 month run. 

It's not too bad, I've had friends that have done it... it's a little similar to jail since it's county run but not even really, I mean the beds and uniforms are similar but the food is better, and super low security... you can technically leave out the door at any time, but it's an automatic state felony for ""absconding"" that carries 2 year sentence, and apparently the sheriffs usually find people in like an hour. My point is, it's better than jail and hey, I fucked up, and hey, I do need help with this addiction, so I was/am down.

So the court officer lady tells me they want me to check in by the following Monday, which is less than a week to get my affairs in order, and that basically if I refuse it would trigger a motion to revoke my probation/all kinds of bad stuff. Then she asked me if I was going to need to be referred to a detox facility first, or at least that's how interpreted her questions at the time, about if I expected to get very very sick. She definitely at least made it clear that they did not expect me to be able to drop this habit on my own, that they did expect me to be detoxing at first. And I said, yeah you're right, and I do expect to get sick, but I don't think it will be anything life-threatening.

Ok. So. I check in to the rehab. Part of my intake was signing a bunch of forms, one of which listed the ""rights"" I have, which included going to the hospital when I want. It was also made clear to me that upon checking in to the rehab, I was switching to a new probation officer that works there at the rehab. I am immediately completely honest with the nurses about my use, expected withdrawal, etc, and with the doctor that examined me the first morning. The girl in the bunk under me is kicking way harder than I am, and I come to learn that she did go to the hospital one of her peak days. 

Anyway, the nurses give me OTC stuff twice a day for my symptoms, Imodium Ibuprofen etc., but it's rough. Come day 3, my dormies are pressuring me to ask to go to the hospital, saying I really don't look good etc. So I do, and the staff basically say they are ""working on it"" for THREE HOURS... my dormies keep telling me it's a violation of my rights and that they got sent right away on request, etc. So they kinda start pressuring the staff on my behalf... three hours later the staff take me to a back room saying all of a sudden that someone needs to be with me at all times, and then finally to another back room, my new PO's office, where I meet my new PO for the first time. Two cops there as well. My new PO tells me there has been a warrant issued for my arrest and that they will be taking me to jail after the ER.

Why? Because ""this facility is not equipped to take care of you. Jail is. This is not a detox facility."" Says that after I'm done detoxing at jail for one or two weeks, I will be returned to the rehab. I'm freaking tf out, saying I don't understand, that I've tried to follow all the rules and be honest and that this is not what I was told before, and that why if the other girls are kicking harder and went, etc... she just says every case is different and that in my case this is what the court ordered. 

The ER gave me a weak Ativan prescription which did follow me to jail, thank god, and to my immense surprise, the next morning the judge DID set a bond for me?! So my BF bails me out. I would've thought they wouldn't let me leave since I was supposed to be finishing my detox there and then return to rehab? But apparently my official ""status"" now is full-blown Motion to Revoke Probation. Guys I am freaking tf out. If I get my probation revoked I could be looking at 180 days in jail to my understanding. My attorney doesn't even understand what happened; he and my family and everyone is basically assuming that I MUST have broken a rule or committed a crime to get a MTRP, he was asking me if I had brought drugs, etc. 

I did have two auxiliary thoughts occur to me. 1) I overheard a conversation right before they took me away to arrest me, where the girl who was kicking hard and went to the hospital, was complaining that someone had ""snitched"" on her for apparently having her dealer meet her at the hospital and using while she was there. So I wonder if that affected how they dealt with me? and, 2) the hospital staff were saying that my readings were actually ok and that my kick wasn't that bad, but it sure felt bad to me, and so I wonder if I was having a panic attack essentially. I had told my therapist in the outpatient program that I have panic attacks ever since my father got charged with four felonies and might spend his life in prison and I've been managing his affairs, and that I was just about to start a Xanax script for my symptoms before I pled into DWI court which does not allow any narcotic meds even prescribed. I wonder if they might consider this anxiety disorder as a mitigating factor.

My next court date is in a week and my attorney thinks I should check in to a 30 day private rehab to kind of do what they wanted me to do, and that he could ""probably"" get the court date pushed back if I did that and use it as a selling point to not revoke my probation. But he also works in a different county and admits he has no idea how this system here works, he's just guessing that would be an option. But I suspect it might ""have"" to be the state-run one... I'm meeting with a local attorney that DOES have experience handling DWI's HERE in this county, tomorrow.

But in the meantime I am still panicking. And yes, using. \*\*I'm not asking for legal advice,\*\* I just want to know if anyone has seen anything remotely similar to this go down, or just if anyone has anything to say at all about this bizarre situation. 

\*\*TLDR:\*\* 2nd DWI, pled into DWI court including IOP, dropped dirty UAs, got referred to state-run rehab and told it would be ok to detox there, got sent to jail from state-run rehab for kicking too hard, now my probation is in ""motion to revoke"" status, freaking tfffff out.",1534282651.0

This is my last insurance approved visit as I lost my insurance in 4 weeks. 

I have no opiates in my system. 

I was given dilaudid at the ER for a serious stomach issue. She'll be able to see that. 

I currently test positive for THC but I can get completely clean piss.

As I can assume from the posts on the front page you guys are, as you call yourselves, ""opiate enthusiasts""!

Regardless, I would guess some of you guys ~~(maybe most?)~~ have been in contacts with **people in higher up-positions like** the police, maybe even jail, people working at different institutes, social workers and so forth. (edited because worded badly and to be fair insulting, I'm sorry)


I work at a treatment home where the clients are there by their own will while undergoing a sort of replacement therapy for opioid dependence, which means they are on either Buprenorphine or Methadone which is given to them daily while undergoing therapy. 

These guys are mostly ""ex"" criminals in that sense they're not actively doing criminal activity right now. Most of them have gone to criminality to sustain their high use of all kind of substances, mostly opiates. 

Even though they are there by their free will and driven to stay drug-free for reasons like they have kids, they are afraid to die etc., having relapses and not returning to treatment is very usual. Most of the time when they have relapses it's because of anxiety of some sort.

My question to you guys is how can I as a social worker be better at understanding their feelings to mostly opiates and help them in their own will to be drug-free? 

Is it something you'd like to ask me, teach me, etc., feel free, I will try to answer and listen to you all.

Thanks in advance!",1534275472.0

Whether you ran out suddenly or it is planned, it **SUCKS** either way. I want you all to hit me with your best tips for getting through that period of time that seems like death. 




##I am mainly looking for tips that deal with: 

**•Nutrition:** how do you keep fed while puking/shitting your guts out? Any specific foods or brands that you SWEAR by that you want on hand if you have a say in the matter?
 
** -** do you utilize vitamin pills/supplements or the like to help maintain nutrition levels? 
How about so-called ""natural remedies""?

**•Comfort:** how do you get through the kicking legs, the horrible body aches and the relentless yawning and tears?

**•The Endless and Incessant Thoughts:** be this the mind numbing boredom, the horrible fiend crave or the deep pit of depression that accompanies the lack of drug. 

***


I am mainly looking for things you can do that do NOT require being given another scrip or drug. 
* This can include if you all feel helped especially by legal CBD and Kratom but they need to **be able to be procured from a store in your neighborhood, not necessarily the internet or illegal means.** *

* Specifically, I don't want to keep hearing to go to the doc to get benzos or methadone or subs or just get weed because let's get real, it just doesn't always work that way. (I will concede to weed but because it isn't legal everywhere, it isn't always the most viable. And yes I do realize that most of our withdrawal are caused by illegal drugs). *

***

Legal, SAFE, proven tips are mainly what I'm looking for.  Hit me with them and be safe out here friends!

(Apologize for formatting, mobile.)

Edit:
I am aware that this is a topic that is pretty widely touched on already here in this sub but I guess I was looking for a little something more, information wise. The general things that are done to make the time easier are pretty well known but I guess I'm looking more for what YOU as an individual find helps you the most. Are there specific brands you go to? Specific exercises and activities you find help ease the ordeal? I have utilized search and very much appreciate the guides but I was hoping to hear more personal experience. Believe me, I've been there and done it. Clean for almost 6months now but there are some aspects about the process that I'm looking to flesh out and gain knowledge over.

My ears began to ring and my vision went black. I couldn’t breathe, like I had just gotten the wind knocked out of me. I could tell Amy was trying to get me up but I was no longer there, my spirit had vanished. 

Reality forced itself back onto me, no matter how much I didnt want to let it back in. My stomach churned and bubbled and I could taste that watery taste that always precedes that kind of throwing up that doesnt feel good when its over. When I was a drinker, during life before opiates, I could remember being drunk and welcoming a good puke, sometimes even forcing it. 

This was different. I felt my cold sweat get hot, my forehead dripping big syrupy drops into my clammy palms where it rested. 

“Are you ok Slim? Slim, talk to me!” Amy demanded. I looked up at her and then back at the pavement. 

As I began to open my mouth, I was planning to try and tell her I was ok. Instead I vomitted onto the pavement where I was kneeling, splashing black bile and stomach acid onto my knees and hoodie sleeves. And then I was lost, puking over and over, so hard and with such fury I couldnt even stop to try and inhale, and I began to suffocate as my bodily functions betrayed me. I would gasp and cough and snot would shoot out of my nostrils. My eyes were crying, not that I was crying for the lost $40, or the fact I had been disowned by the only family I had left willing to put up with me, or the fact I was kneeling in snow and ice and now puke and stomach acid, with no home and no friends I trusted. I was crying because I was vomiting so hard the pressure was forcing all of the fluid in my head out. 

When it finally was over, Amy was whimpering, tears in her eyes. 

“I am so sorry.” she said, and crouched over me from behind, wrapping her arms around me. 

“I really cant believe he did that.”

.....

Jeff was from Atlanta, by way of Haiti. He had the darkest skin I have ever seen on a black man, and his dreads were long. He wasn’t anywhere near as tall as me, but he had that kind of frame that I knew meant he could probably murder someone with his bare hands, if he had good reason to do so.

I had heard about him from Amy, and then again from Matt when I sat on the filthy wood floor in his tiny room, smoking cigarettes and just being happy I wasnt outside in the snow. 

“Bro, he came down here last weekend and we sat in this room for like 36 hours, doing nothing but getting fucking GEEKED!” Matt said, smiling and throwing a fist in the air in triumph. 

“No bullshit he had like a quarter of soft, maybe more, and we smoked the whole shit.” Matt said, lighting another Marlboro red. 

“Who chef’ed it though?” I asked, hoping I might find an opportunity to use my most prized skill. I had learned to cook crack cocaine in Richmond. Sure, like everyone else, I had first tried to learn to cook crack from the internet, googling and reading different TEKs and watching youtube videos. Cocaine is expensive. Cooking it into crack so it could be smoked required experience and skill, and it was easy to fuck it up. I had personally ruined at least a few grams trying to learn. Sometimes it came out ok, smokeable at least. Sometimes it was a complete loss, depending on the quality of the powder. So when one of my boys from Richmond had began to use my kitchen to cook his shit, I kept asking him to teach me. At first, he refused. He would call me, usually about once a week, and say “Yo I need to use the kitchen.” 

“Ok, come through, Im here.” I would reply, excited to get the crack he would give me for letting him do his thing in my house. The first couple of times he came over and cooked, I tried to nonchalantly watch him, but he would turn around and say “Yo please dont crowd me bro, I’ll be done in a minute.” I thought about and realized that I would probably want to be left alone too, since he was in the process of converting his $900 investment into $1800, and if he fucked it up, it would be a catastrophic financial loss. The more I thought about it, I began to change how I behaved around him when he was there to cook. I started keeping the kitchen clean all the time, instead of leaving dirty dishes all in the sink and on the counters. When he came over the 3rd and 4th time to cook, I had the water in the pot simmering, the pyrex clean and dry, fresh unopened boxes of Arm & Hammer on the counter, next to a clean knife, spoon, and fork I had flattened. 

He noticed these preparations and then one day he showed up and said “You are going to help me this time, you cool with that?” 

Learning how to cook cocaine is not done overnight. Sure, the process isnt too complicated: you add sodium bicarbonate to cocaine hydrochloride, usually in a ratio of about 1:3, then some water, which you heat until the bicarbonate reacts with the cocaine and begins to bond to it. Once the reaction is about done, you remove the heat, let it cool, and remove the new crack cocaine from the water, let it dry, and its ready to smoke. 

But there were so many variables. How much baking soda to add depended on the quality of the cocaine powder. How much had the cocaine powder been cut, and what adulterants had been added was a major variable as well. Learning to identify the quality of cocaine powder required experience and knowing what to look for. Was the cocaine powder still hard and in chunks, or “blocked up” as I called it, or was it just a bag of powder, like a ziploc full of flour? Did it have a shine to it, little crystals that reacted to the light? If it was blocked up, did it have a grain when you broke a piece off, like a slab of granite, or was it repress, which meant someone had cut it already and then put it in a hydraulic press and squeezed it back together, making it appear to be higher quality than it was. The cocaine game, like most of the drug game, is complex and dynamic, and people were always trying to find new and innovative ways to make more money.

I learned all these skills and nuances, just like any apprentice shadowing a mastered artist, during my time in Richmond. My boy that taught me to cook ended up becoming one of my closest friends, and he taught me so much about the game and life in general. When I moved back up north, I gave him my favorite possession, a digital jewelers scale that measured accurately to the thousands, 3 digits to the right of the 0. 

“I want you to make a million dollars with this, Fortune 5000” I said when I handed it to him, using the nickname I had given him. Cooking crack was something I did better than anyone else I had ever met since I had left Richmond, better even than the d boys I met in the projects or on the block in New Bedford. I was Heisenberg of that crack shit. 

“Slim can cook like a mad scientist” Amy said to Matt. “You gotta see my bro in action.”

“Really?” Matt said, looking a bit puzzled. “Dude can you show me? Because I suck at it. I mean I can do it, but I dunno, its like its always a little bit off, I only get lucky and get it right every once in a while.”

“Sounds like you probably use too much water” I said, snubbing out my cigarette in the ash tray. “Its easy to cook, but its not easy to do it the right way every time. I can help you though, I’d be happy to.”

“Sweet!” Matt squeaked in excitement. “Im gonna text Jeff now, see whats up.” 

A few minutes passed, and then Jeff replied to Matt’s text. He was working, and woudnt be home til late that night. I asked Matt “Do you have any money? I mean I can call someone if you want, thats no probem.” I was hoping he did, cause I needed to make every penny I could, and any chance to middle man a package meant I would profit in some way. It did not matter the drug, the amount, or the circumstances around the transaction. I could out-hustle anyone, I was a scorpion, cold, calculated, and dangerous when I needed to be. I kept a box of sandwich bags, a box of baking soda, a bottle of miralax, and a bottle of benefiber in my backpack with me, 24/7. I was always prepared to cook, cut, and bag up. It was how I survived. 

“No, no money, but Im telling you bro, Jeff has a shitload of coke. He had a fucking black trash bag of it when he walked in here this weekend.”

I would come to find out much later, that Jeff was perpetrating a huge lie to everyone he met. He talked about being “plugged in”, and because he was from ATL, most people just assumed he must have been what he claimed to be. He claimed he got his bricks in the mail every month. He claimed he was connected to Meech and BMF. He claimed he had a fucking arsenal of guns. What I ended up learning much later that summer, was that Jeff was a pathological liar and a bullshit artist, a fraud so full of shit his eyes were brown. He wasnt getting anything in the mail but past-due bills, definitely not kilos of cocaine. He did have a trashbag full of cocaine that one weekend like Matt said, and they did smoke around a half ounce, like 14 grams, but he only had it because he had robbed an actual drug dealer at gun point that same night he walked into Matts room pretending he was Scarface. 

But I didnt know this yet. In my mind, I was thinking I had just found a reason to hope I would be cooking and smoking coke very soon, probably even finding an opportunity to shoot some powder, and I was already imagining the joyous rush of cocaine I hoped Id be having sometime in the very near future.

Matt and Amy kept insisting I meet Jeff, and I eventually did. The house Matt lived in was a boarders house about a 5 minute walk from the Hyannis Bus Terminal. It had around 6 different bedrooms that were rented by the month, a shared kitchen and a few shared bathrooms. Matts room was on the first floor in the back, and had a seperate door to the outside, which was cool. Jeffs room was upstairs, through the main entrance, and was flanked by a room on each side, one of which was vacant. When I met Jeff, Amy and I went up to his room with him, and we talked and bullshitted while he told me about himself and his connections. He said he had been born in Haiti, that much was obvious, and that his mother had abandoned him in the hospital as a newborn, to go back to the streets of Haiti and her crack addiction. He was quick to point out he was a crack baby. He was adopted by his grandmother, who lived in ATL, and moved there when he was 10. Then at some point his mother also moved to ATL, and he moved in with her. I will never forget him telling me how his mother had ashtrays overflowing with crack stems like an ashtray full of cigarette butts. I could only feel sorrow and empathy for him when he told me that, I knew what that meant. I felt a little pang of guilt for being raised by parents that didnt smoke coke or shoot dope, even if they were divorced and my childhood was traumatic. 

Jeff wasnt all bad. He was just a con artist. I eventually figured his whole hustle out, just like I do with anyone I spend any real time with. He would claim, like he did with me that night, that he had never smoked crack, that he only had ever just sniffed coke. I had some coke, and I cooked it in a spoon on his coffee table while he watched me with the focus of a hawk. I could tell he was shocked and impressed when I flicked a yellow boulder out onto the lotto ticket on the table to dry, looking up to smile at him. 

“That’ll put some hair on your chewing gum” I said, in the best Early Cuyler voice I could muster.

“Damn that does look pretty good” Jeff said. “I dont know though, I aint never smoked that shit before, I’m not sure I should”

“You absolutely shouldnt” I said, and I meant it. “You do at your own peril, trust me my dude. You shouldnt ever take the panties of this bitch. I’ll give you some powder if you wanna sniff. I just wanted to show you I can chef. I dont want to turn you out.”

“Fuck it” Jeff said, grabbing a stem and bringing it his lips. “I want to see what this is all about”.

So Jeffs hustle was that he pretended he had never smoked crack before. People were always generous with someone smoking coke their first time, he had figured that out and was exploiting it. 

I tell you about Jeff for a good reason. 

Jeff and I became cool, and he knew I was homeless. He looked out for me on a few occasions, telling me I could sleep in the vacant room next to his. I had to leave by 6am, and it was just an empty room, but it was shangra la compared to being hunched over in some bando too cold and too scarred to sleep for more than a few minutes at a time. I would take my hoodie off, fold it up, lay it on top of my backpack, and kind of lean against it in a half reclined half laid down position. I would wake up and my legs would be numb, my back screaming at me, but when your homeless you come to appreciate things others would claim intolerable. I wasnt comfortable, but I was safe and warm. You also learn what it means to be truly grateful when you are on the streets. Jeff barely knew me, but letting me crash in that room put him at risk because it could end up coming back on him if I was caught, or caught the house on fire, or refused to leave when 6am came. I always made sure to thank him and I never got caught or fucked up his situation. 

So anyway, one night, probably about a month after Sean jumped in the Honda and left me to die on the sidewalk that day, Jeff and I were sitting on the front porch his house, me smoking newport reds, him smoking a blunt. It was dark out, probably like 10pm, and we were just bullshitting when all of a sudden, we see a figure appear in the street, walking slowly towards us. As the walking figure got within eyesight, I immediately recognized who it was, someone I hadnt seen for a long time, no matter how much I had looked and asked others where he was. 

It was Sean, the same pony tailed greasy sack of shit that had looked me in the eyes promising me relief only to leave me to die in the street. 

“Jeff, stay right here, I gotta go handle something” I whispered, standing up out of the wooden Adirondack chair. 

“Where you going nigga?” Jeff asked in his strong drawl, half Haitian and half southern.

“I gotta go do this thing real quick” I said, as I walked down off the porch towards Sean. 

Sean looked at me coming towards him and immediately I saw terror on his face. I went into my pocket for the boxcutter I had, and I heard him say “Ohhhh shiiiiit” but after that I went black.

I came to, hand covered in blood, standing over Sean writhing around on the pavement, and realized what I had down. 

“My face!!! My fucking face!!!” Sean screamed, clutching at the piece of cheek hanging from his jaw. 

“Shut the fuck up you little bitch or I’ll give the other buck fifty and make it a whole 3 dollars” I seethed. “You really thought you wouldnt ever see me again? Your lucky I dont open up your windpipe and let you leak out on GP. Pick your shit up and get the fuck out my face, and dont ever cross my path again or I might finish what I started on you.” 

This wasnt me. I dont know who the person speaking out of my mouth was, but I didnt protest much either. I was due some payback, some actual balancing of the karmic scales. Sean had robbed me of my last $40, and he did it in a way that was cowardly and disgusting. He could have shorted my bag and gotten over on me, but I still would have gotten well and it would have been nothing more than another drug deal. Instead, I later learned that the boys he called who he absconded with that day didnt even HAVE DOPE. They only hustled coke. Sean was NEVER planning to help me, he was going to beat me from the jump.

Sean picked himself up off the ground just as Jeff came off the porch scolding me. “What the fuck wrong with you Slim. Now the fucking feds gon be here, you better hope this white boy dont call police. I dont need this kind of heat my nigga, you gotta relax.” 

“Bro this that bitch that beat me when I was on my death bed, remember I told you a while back about it. Fuck all that police shit, he knows better.” Sean immediately mumbled “Im not gonna call proliceeee” and the 3 of us all realized at that moment, that Sean's mouth and his speech were fucked up from the laceration reaching from his ear to his lip crease. 

“Just go, faggot” I said, as the guilt started creeping in. I never was violent by nature. I abhorred hurting people, to be honest. But I had learned as a young man, sometimes others leave you no choice. Not acting would be like saying “its ok to hurt me”. So I did what the fuck needed to be done. I’d push it down and away, like so much of what I had experienced, and deal with it later.

I never saw Sean again. Not that he wasnt still out and around. People always told me when they saw him. No, he was making it his job to avoid me at any cost. And he disappeared into the fog of my past, eventually becoming a forgotten memory.

Its supposed to have lots of benefits. Clear urine that is. and i know  a high % of opiates are excreted in urine. What does h break down into in urine? Would drinking it have any effects? Or would it only work for oxy and what not 

 Honestly its not that gross to drink your own clear urine. Doesnt even have a taste really. Id be willing to drink it if it gave a free high. Someone posted about extracting it also. Im curious about that as well. As much money we spend on this it would be awesome to be able to recover 80 - 90% of it instead of it literally going down the drain",1534261883.0

A twin mattress faced a tiny TV that had to be from the early 1990’s. The bed sheets were mismatched and had human hair on them. The blanket was filthy. I slept in my clothes on the top of the bed.

It was late March, and it had snowed again the night before. I woke up shivering, chilled to the bone, incapable of getting my body temperature to rise. There was no heat in the room, no way to warm up. I attempted to take a hot shower as a last resort but the shower didn’t work. 
The motel room had been paid for by a clinic I had been getting my suboxone from. I had called my counselor/doctor there the day I became homeless and had told him what happened. He had put me in touch with another counselor there and she had gotten me the room for 3 nights. Checkout was in 4 hours.

I decided it made no sense to sit in the room til 10:30am. I was homeless and about to be on the street in the winter, 6 inches of snow on the ground, 35 degrees in the day, 25 and sometimes 10 at night. My fate had been decided. I was facing a world I had never been in, and I was truly afraid. 

Ok so I haven’t told you everything yet. Being homeless was already terrifying and dangerous, but I also had another problem, a major one. I was out of suboxone, had $40 to my name, and I was beginning to get really sick. Being dope sick in the warmth and safety of your own home was intolerable, so the prospect of being dope sick on the street in freezing cold weather with nowhere to go was about the closest thing to hell on earth I could imagine. So I decided to leave the motel room and get to the block. Maybe I could find someone with dope for sale. I had $40 which would get me at least enough heroin to keep me well for the day into the night, if I was smart about how much I did. I just had to find someone to buy from. 
I walked out of the motel room wearing the only clothes I had: a grey winter beanie on my head, a grey hoodie (hood up), a pair of dark blue jeans, my black tactical backpack, and a pair of camouflage air max. 

I trekked through the snow across the street and headed down to the bus station where almost always a few street kids or homeless drunks could be found. I’d driven by them a million times, now I was one of them. I wondered if they would accept me or if I would be shunned. I wondered if I’d end up dead in some bando with a blade buried in my ear, pockets pulled out of my jeans like rabbit ears. I wondered about my future. 

Around 8am I saw Amy, and she immediately knew what kind of shape I was in:

“You look like shit bro. Do you need a sub?”

“No, fuck subs, I need dope.” I said, stubbornly.

“Babe just take a sub - you will feel better and not waste your money” she countered, and she was right. 

“Nah I want to get dope sis. It gotta be dope. I’m fucking homeless out here in March. I stayed clean for 2 months for nothing. I’m not gonna be on the street and not use.
I need to get on and leave the disaster that has become my life behind for a while.”

“Ok hun I understand but if you decide you want a sub just tell me. But I’m sure we can find you something, how much do you have?”

“$40, and I want at least a .4” 

“Yea ok lets go over to the Jamaican store and see who we bump into”

Amy and I had met a few days before, and she had taken on the role of defacto street Mom to me. When she introduced me to other people on the street, she would say:

“And this is my brother Slim. Oh you didn’t know I had a brother? Yup, he just got out of prison.”

I had watched her closely as she had taken me under her wing me in the previous 3 days. I had the motel room those first 3 nights. Now I was truly homeless. At first I suspected she was just trying to set me up for a quick lick, like trying to see if I was worth anything, if I had anything she wanted, etc. But she had been nothing but genuine and compassionate to me, so I was starting to trust her.
As we walked to the Jamaican store, Amy asked everyone we bumped into if they knew where we could find some dope. It made no sense really. Any other day there were 50 people around with heroin for sale. I ended up needing it the one morning of the month that nobody had anything. Then just as we arrived at the store, we bumped into Sean.
I had seen Sean a few times before, and he always had the same clothes on: Black sweat pants, raggedy white new balance sneakers, a black Boston College sweatshirt and his slick black hair, pulled into a pony tail. I had actually met him once when I had been staying at the hotel with the jacuzzis in the rooms, partying with a couple girls. I was walking through the hotel hallways looking for an ice machine and I came across him, down in the back hallway of the hotels bowels. I spoke to him briefly, later realizing he was basically squatting down there, probably because he had no where else to go.
Amy flagged Sean down and told him what the situation was. 

“Yeah I can get that for you right now, what did you need?” he asked.

“Look man, Im going to make this simple for you. I don’t let my bread walk. So it’s like this: you can bring your people to me and I transact with them, or you can put your money up for it and then sell it to me. But you ain’t taking my cash and dipping, leaving me to wait for you to come back.”

“Bro I totally understand, I absolutely get it”.

“Man I’m not trying to be a dick, it’s just I am sick as fuck, I’m getting worse, and this is the last $40 I got so I have to get straight or I’m gonna be fucked”

He looked me straight in my eyes and said “listen man, I’ve been there. I’ve been sick like you are, I’m not going to do that to you. I know how it feels to be that sick, I couldn’t do that to you”
 
“Ok so how do we do this?” I asked him.

Before he could answer, Amy jumped in front of him and said “Sean don’t fuck around. This is my brother. If you do any dirty shit I swear to god I will hunt you down and I will cut you.” 

Sean paused and looked at Amy for a moment, and then blurted out “Amy I know you are crazy I’m not stupid ok, believe me I know.”

At this point I was starting to think Sean would play fair. I told him I would break off a piece of dope for him if my package was correct, and I planned to do just that. Being stingy in the street, homeless or not, is ill advised. Felony favors aren’t free. 
Sean made a phone call, and then proceeded to explain what was going to happen.

“Ok so my dude is on the way here. When he pulls up I will go to his car with your cash and grab it from him through his window, then walk right back to you. I’ll never leave your sight.”

“No bro, I told you, my money doesn’t walk.” At that same moment I could feel the withdrawal symptoms beginning to go into overdrive. I had maybe 30 minutes before I would be incapable of controlling my bowels anymore, and once I took that first shit, what I call “breaking the seal”, I would be vacating my bowels for the next 4 hours, eventually squirting diarrhea to the point that my asshole would burn from passing so much shit and acidic stomach bile. I was beginning to panic on the inside, knowing that if this thing I was trying to do with Sean didn’t work out I was gonna be in real trouble. It was fucking freezing out, but I was soaked in cold sweat. My nose was pouring clear snot. My eyes were running, my muscles starting to burn and ache. 

Sean made another call, and then looked at me and said “yo my dude don’t want to meet new people so it’s either I take your money to him or it can’t happen”. I looked at Amy, and she said “I think you can trust him. If he does anything, he knows I’m gonna cut him from ear to ear.” 
Now normally, in this situation, I always stood my ground. I refuse to let people take my money and buy for me; if I can’t handle the business then we can’t do business. But I was desperate. He seemed sincere. Amy made me feel like Sean understood the dire repercussions he would face if he took off with my cash. So against my better judgement I agreed to let Sean walk to the car with my last $40. 
When the car pulled up, it drove past us on the sidewalk and stopped about 10 yards away. I handed Sean the 2 twenty dollar bills from my pocket and watched him as he walked to the car. 
He immediately opened the rear door behind the driver. Ok, I thought, he’s gonna get in to transact. Maybe dudes window was up. 
He pulled the car door closed and the next thing I heard was him saying “Yo GO GO GO!!!” And with that I watched my money drive away in a late model teal Honda Accord, two Dominican kids from providence in front, Sean in back, turned around looking at me to see if I was going to try to chase.
I lifted my hand and made a pistol with my fingers, pointed it at him, and made the “Bang” motion. 
The car turned fast and hard around the corner and was gone.

So I made a purchase from a reputable online vendor recently. I usually purchase Afghan #4 but after trying some really good street tar I decided I wanted to find an online tar vendor. I found one who advertises their product as gun powder but everyone in reviews and other places mentioned it is actually tar, though a very good quality tar. 

When I received package this stuff was in a bag but looked super dry almost crusty brown looking, texture of wood, matte finish. When I took it out of the bag, it immediately started soaking up humidity from the air and turned into the the blackest tar I’ve seen yet. Not super sticky but u could tell it was tar as before it looked weird. Now the thing that is tripping me out is the smell. It smells completely different than the vinegar smell I know and love from street tar. I do not shoot up, I usually do monkey water in a spray bottle or turn to cheese. But this stuff smells so bad/unique that I wonder if this is cut with something or maybe it has something added to it to turn into that wood consistency for easy shipping or to pass off as gun powder? Figured if anyone knew what was up it would be you guys. I tried some last night, only 0.02 to test it out as it is supposed to be really strong but I didn’t feel much just fell asleep. I would really appreciate the help. Thanks guys and gals. ",1534255668.0

I’ve been saddled with treatment-resistant clinical depression for about 20 years now, and this last week has been quite bad; I’ve basically been holed up in my room for the majority of the time.  The reading & identifying have helped me to stay (relatively) sane, and so I want to thank all of you for all that you say & share.  (I’m also a drunk & drug addict in recovery, thank my maker.)

Often, when I’m quite depressed, I struggle to put cogent thoughts together, and can have difficulty writing well, which is extraordinarily frustrating for me.  That said, I’ll do my best here.

It might be tempting for some to think that I’m treating my pain by marveling at the misery of others, but I am truly not a sadist, nor do I ever take any joy in the sorrow of another soul.  It would be more accurate to say that I find it comforting to be among my kind.   Drunks, junkies, stoners, freaks, those with one sort of mental illness or another...  it’s been my experience that we all have lived a certain special type of agony that cannot be adequately explained on the written page, or by the spoken word.  (We’ve long since stopped trying to explain this kind of thing to the layman.)

As I read the various posts & stories, I see myself in each of them.  From the seeming-and-fleeting happiness in the early years of my using, to the untold hell of an addicted life, to the yearning for recovery while achieving none, to finally getting & living clean.   I’m reading it all from each of you, and it’s all me too.

It seems that my depression is a demon which may have reeked more pain & destruction on my life than any other, over the years.  This is the one demon from which I simply have not been able to achieve significant, sustained recovery.  I do honestly wonder if I ever will.  On nights like tonight, I do a lot of doubting.

Finally, two years ago, I was sponsoring a new kid in the deal who was about 90 days clean.  Rob, a recovering heroin addict.  I loved that kid.  He was me when I got sober.   He was just like me.   We worked together for weeks.  And then one single day passed without him calling me, as he always did. The next day, I got the call.  Yeah, that one.  Done.  One shot.  Over.   I was absolutely devastated.

I don’t want that to be me today, and I don’t want it to be you either.  But it’s gonna be somebody.  That’s just the fucked up reality of this thing.  Because of being able to read what you say, I’m just a little better tonight than I would otherwise have been, and I thank you all for that most sincerely.  Similarly, all of you continue to help, protect, encourage & save each other by saying & sharing all that you do.

I may not necessarily have a lot to offer, but I feel strongly compelled to express my thanks.

I’ve been to treatment numerous times, done the whole medical maintenance thing with suboxone and shouted, lived in sober living, etc. and at the end of the day none of it has had long term success because I end up back with heroin. 

So now to the weird part. All I want is someone to be with that can enjoy the lifestyle I lead which is pretty much just getting high, working, occasionally going out with friends, and occasionally traveling. But it’s like there are no men out there who want some girl that is on heroin and is happy being on heroin. Maybe I’ve just watched too many movies (Requiem, Candy, Heaven Knows What, etc.) that romanticize the experience of being in love and in a relationship while also on dope together, or maybe it’s just too much to ask. I cannot for the life of me figure it out. 

I’ve been in 2 different relationships where me and my boyfriend at the time we’re on dope and I loved those relationships. It just seems like I haven’t been able to find another one that will actually last longer than a couple months. 

Any one else have this weird expectation or is it just me? ",1534224517.0

Unfortunately, I fucked up on day 21 and relapsed.. I promised myself it would be a one day thing. Woke up the next day without withdrawals and convinced myself i'd be safe to use once every 3 days.. Like always, this turned into everyday. I've now used 8 of the last 12 days with 6 of those days being consecutive. I'm right back at square 1 and withdrawal every morning when I wake up.. Feel a ton of guilt right now and can't go back to detox/rehab or I will lose my job. I've decided that suboxone will be the best route for me in my attempt at getting clean. I cannot miss anymore days of work. Not even 2 days or I will be fired. My question for all of you is, how long does the process of getting prescribed suboxone take? If i scheduled an appointment and meet with the doctor, will I be given a dose that day? or do I need to keep coming back for multiple appointments before I will be given a script?

My diagnosis is post laminectomy syndrome with arachnoiditis and bilateral radiopathy. Conservative methods like epidurals, PT, spinal cord stim, non-opioid pain killers do not work to control my pain.  Doctor after doctor is dropping their opioid patients, finding them too big a risk to their license.  The last doctor to discharge me admitted opioids were appropriate for me (I was in compliance, no increases in dose, no alternative treatments, etc) but fears all the crackdowns happening.

I am about to try and find a new pain doc, just want to figure out some of the puzzling behavior of my last doctor and his PA.  The pain doc was pressuring me to get epidurals and other procedures already demonstrated and fully documented to make my condition worse (all the epidurals caused arachnoiditis.)  He also seemed angry I wouldn’t pay $9K out of pocket for a procedure because my insurance won’t cover it (considered experimental.)  The procedure offered little relief in the past anyway, barely above what might be the placebo effect (RFA.)  His PA was constantly pressuring me to report I was in less pain than I actually was.  If I didn’t cave to their pressures, they made indications they would discharge me.  I was eventually discharged when I asked my doctor to fill out forms to activate my temporary disability insurance.  

As I was discharged while in compliance, I am not sure what to tell the next pain management doc.  I need this stuff to live, without I am in so much pain I am bed-ridden and constantly contemplating suicide- not in a depressed way, just in a escaping misery kind of way.  I am by no means an addict, I am a responsible father and husband with good ties to the community.  While other opioids do make me high, the hydrocodone I am on does not impair me (or give me feeling of euphoria) even at the high dose i’m on (80 mg total a day.)

Is anyone out there that can provide me with insights into pain doctor’s minds.  Why are they pressuring me in ways that are counter to my care?  How should I respond so that I can attain a high standard of care for my condition?

I wish I didn’t need opioids to live.  Life had become so hard since the new regulations, life has been absolute hell.  Before anyone asks, I have an odd brain chemistry.  Weed makes me psychotic, so does ultram (makes me have violent and suicidal impulses.)  Not willing to take illegal drugs.

I guess it's time to change that. To anyone reading this who knew me in high school, I guess hi. To the kid who fucked up my life, I'm fairly certain you know who you are and what your actions did to me, but I've not heard from you in years, so maybe you're blissfully unaware. I'm not exactly mad at this one person, but I'm certainly mad at the world for keeping me here and not letting me die in peace like I wanted to for years. I'm somehow not suicidal as of 2018, to which I credit psychedelics for helping me build a wall between myself and the suicidal mindset.          
  
Back to the story.       
             
I was injured in 2011, a few months before my 16th birthday. It was a joke, to be fair. To explain what happened that day I have to explain a game that used to be played.   Someone who was my “friend” used to play this game called “Gaddafi”. The objective of the game was to shove your hand/foot up the person's ass without them being prepared. I know, high school shit. This was a logical extension of the game we used to play called “con queso” where you'd walk up behind someone and grab their ass. It was pretty gay to be honest, and I'm pretty sure most of the people playing these games are fairly bi or outright gay now.       
       
As things do when you're young and stupid, these things escalated pretty quick. I was standing in the middle of a hallway minding my own business, when out of nowhere - it happened. The single most devastating moment of my entire life happened. This “friend” ran up behind me full tilt, screamed “Gaddafi” and kneed me up into the air so hard that I flew up a number of feet, fell back down, and landed on the exact same spot where I had been kicked/kneed. The knee hit me between my tailbone and my pelvic floor, an area I later learned existed when a doctor diagnosed me with chronic pelvic floor dysfunction/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. I instantly saw black and rolled around on the floor for over a minute. It took over 2 minutes before I could see anything but black, and the pain was intense.        
       
It took about 2 years for the full damage to take hold. I was carrying a pillow to class for a few months after the injury, but eventually the pain got a little better. And then it got worse. I was an avid mountain biker at the time when this injury occurred, and in the years following. At almost exactly the two year mark after the injury the pain came out of nowhere and absolutely floored me. I couldn't walk, couldn't stand, couldn't leave bed. I spent my entire senior year of high school being homeschooled and beginning the chapter of my life where I didn't leave bed for over a year in a half, no exaggeration. Peeing in water bottles, attempting to stand every few days and winding up on the floor and needing my mom to pick me back up.               
    
And the fucking pain. I woke up screaming almost every single morning. It's hard to describe this kind of pain to someone who hasn't dealt with chronic pain. The best way I could describe it is that it was like waking up at the bottom of the ocean. I would start hyperventilating and screaming immediately, completely unable to deal with the sensation of pain radiating up and down my spine. The pain spread out over the course of those two years. It started just in my tailbone, then down my legs, then up my back. Eventually it seemed to “settle” in my face, burning and buzzing like I had my hand on an electrical socket. It would buzz behind my teeth to the point where my entire field of vision would blur and spin, making walking completely impossible from that point forward. Because the pain set in years after the injury, it took me a very long time to put the pieces together.      
     
Around the 2 and a half year mark of unbearable chronic pain (a few weeks before my 17th birthday), I discovered weed. By discovered weed, I mean I discovered my mom smoked weed. We all had suspected it, but one day I found myself in her bed (obviously having been carried there) and smelled it through her closet door. She had left the door of the safe open. She went away later that day and I stumbled over, crawling on the floor as I had learned to do, and lifted myself up to the safe sat on the floor. I didn't even hesitate for a second when I pulled the handle of the cheap lock box as hard as I could and felt it break in my hands. I pulled out a bag which I would later learn was an ounce worth of bud, closed the door, and crawled back to bed. I found one of her one hitters and a lighter in the bag and laid down on her bed as I packed my first hit of pot.       
       
Again, it's hard to describe these sensations to someone who has never been in this kind of situation. It didn't make my pain go away, but it certainly did more than anything else I had ever been given. To be fair, I hadn't been given any pain medicine at this point other than 25mg of tramadol which didn't do jack shit. I held the smoke in and stood up. The pain still felt like someone had hooked jumper cables to my tailbone, but I was standing. I wasn't buckling at the knees and falling on my face as I had the years past. I finally had some semblance of control.        
        
What follows is 5 years of heavy, if not excessive cannabis use. I made no effort to hide it from my family, and our house quickly became engulfed in a strong scent of vaporized marijuana. I picked up cooking it pretty quick, and soon I was filling gel capsules with infused coconut oil and carrying them with me everywhere I went.        
        
It's an understatement to say I was never without weed. I was never without upwards of a half oz worth of weed. I spent years doing this until it started to not work.        
         
At age 16 I was prescribed muscle relaxants and gabapentin. At age 17 I was given my first script for opioids. In retrospect, I think swallowing the first pill was the most terrible decision I've ever made, as well as the best decision I've ever made.     
       
I'm going to leave the story here for now, as it's so long and convoluted that I don't think it would fit in a single Reddit post and make any sense in a single sitting.

But I heard from my friend today that another friend of mine had snorted 0.5g heroin yesterday and now he doesn't answer his phone or anything? Isn't this a very high dose? I believe my friend has a moderate opiate tolerance but definitely NOT a high one. 

He only started expirmenting with opiates a few months ago and mostly Oxycontin and codeine and started using heroin only occasionally in the beginning of the summer I think and I have no idea what dosages he's used too. So is 0.5 enough to kill you? Also I think he might have drank beers too... ",1534168582.0

I have taken Tramadol approximately i dont know, 25 times in the past 6 months due to extreme pain
My dose is very low
I try splitting the 50mg capsules in half sometimes


ANYWAYS!

What ive noticed with Tramadol is that sometimes it works extremely extremely well like i had just unlocked the key to enlightenment,

And sometimes it does not.

I am not opiate naive,

I take it before, or after my Suboxone

Taking it after produces a more sedating effect


ON THE GOOD DAYS THAT TRAMADOL WORKED,
It was like clear-headed pain killing focus

But that was only a couple of times

I am now foregoing the Tramadol.

Buprenorphine relieves my pain but it is not controlling it to the degree that i need . I have not tried re-doseing bupe as i do not know if it would have any effect taking more hours later . 

Buprenorphine though hasn't produced any side effects
it acts as a typical opiate , just no pain killing effects, which fucking sucks

I am taking a boatload of NSAIDs alternating between diclofenac/naproxen and motrin in conjunction with tylenol and a few other things and its wearing thin on me.

I have some type of facial pain disorder which also has created a TMJ (jaw/ears/etc) disorder. some type of neuralgia . i have to get more MRIs.

So the doc gave me 15 tramadol, i had a few at home anyways,and yea, shit, i lost track

Anyways Tramadol has some horrendous side effects including memory loss, tremors, loss of coordination and focus, inability to focus, fuck me in the ass


It did help with upper-scalp migraines . 

so what do i ask for next?

the doctor knows i take suboxone, and has spoken with my suboxone doctor, which is how i got the trams

I don't want to come off as a drug seeker even though im seeking drugs to cure my goddamn pain lol

I would appreciate any input on how to discuss with my doctor to switch to ANYTHING (literally anything) even if its abuse proof: i.e. abuse proof oxy, abuse proof hydrocodone, etc.",1534163547.0

I actually first tried it because of this girl I had a huge crush on was a pot head. Interesting enough 18 years later that same  Girl is laying in bed Next to me sleeping as I write this. 

It’s Been a rough road to get where we are, and I only see things getting harder for us both. Now if your thinking this is some great love story about how drugs brought us together you would be wrong. Drugs have done nothing but tear the two of us apart time and time again. Some how though we always end up back with each other. This on/off again relationship took a major turn 10 years ago when she Told me that she had begun using Heroin. At the time I was still a pot head and completely opposed to the idea of using anything harder. 

At the time she had come to me, wanting to stop, at least that is what she said and we gave it a go, but with time i realized that i didn’t trust her, and therefore I didn’t love her.  We split up this time for about 3 years, until i found out she had been arrested for forging checks. I thought at the time maybe this would be her chance to stop so i decided to start corresponding with her until she got out of jail and after we started living forward again. Yet still there was trust issues, and eventually we again broke it. 

Over the years we have not spoken I rarely seen her around the small town we live in, when i did it was the only way i knew she was alive, at one point i was even checking the obituaries every morning with my breath held convinced that today would be the day I would find her name . 

about Three years ago I found out that after i last split up she had become homeless, and was eventually taken in off the streets by some one who was also abusing Heroin and other drugs, we ran in to each other and some angry words where exchanged and it ended with me having a mental breakdown. See she has a funny way of making everyone around her think they are crazy especially me. She actually had me doubting myself that I was just paranoid and that she was clean all this time.  eventually i would find out the truth though. 

This last April I finally did see her Name on the front page of the newspaper only not in the obituaries, but the front page story with the headline Three arrested for Prostitution. Wow my heart broke instantly i’ve known this woman she was 16. About a month later When she got out she emailed me, two weeks went by before i actually seen the email,  it said she was sober and determined to stay that way. So with out a second thought i responded. 

Came to find out what had happened, and that she was once again homeless, In all honesty I believed her when she told me she wasn’t using, but i still didn’t trust her. One other issue we have had over the years is my temper and nothing brings that out more then some one lying to me. several things happened over the next month to make me question her honesty about being clean. Then she had a bad day and came to me telling me that she wanted to shoot again, and I made the biggest mistake of my life. 

I told her if you do it, I do it and so we did. A week later she moved in with me and not a single night has passed that we haven’t shot Heroin.

I don’t want too, yet I feel like i have made a deal with the devil and there is no getting out of it now, I only hope at some point she is ready to stop, and that i still have the strength to do so my self.  I love her with all my heart and if need be I will dive in to hell to drag her out, I just hope we can both make it back.",1534140934.0

Anyways... Long story short. I've been an IV user a long time now, going on 8 years or so, so as you can assume most of my veins are shit and completely collapsed to say the least thru out my arms. I was hitting my neck pretty good until one too many goofballs started making shit not so easy. Tonight I decided to save myself some grief and went for my legs. I work out a lot lately, I'm about 6'1""-6'2"" and 220 and for a chick it makes me more vascular then others so I've always had really good and visible leg veins, rarely used ever. After my shot which wasn't anymore or less and from a plug who is very steady with their brand, its always the same down to a T, I got this insane rush almost like the first time, I felt it in my chest and could taste it, this hasn't happened in for fucking ever. I mean I could do the same shot in area I frequent and never get this feeling, but why is that ?? Has this ever come to anyone else's attention? I assume most areas are packed with scar tissues as thick as my pinky, or maybe they have a lot of plaque buildup that could be affecting how much or little is actually breaking beyond the blood/brain barrier..

We pulled into the Chevron. She jumped out to see if she could get me some brown for the 14 bucks. The guys in the car had some but they wanted $40. She told me to drive to a few other places and jumped out to check at different houses. I swerved to one last house, and while she was in the house my guts shook. My sphincter quivered. An untied leather boot turned itself around inside of me and tried to push itself through my throat before I puked up bile and red cough syrup all over the interior of my mother’s Mercedes Benz. I opened the door and slid out of the vehicle into the street to pull down my pants. An aerosol of liquid sprayed the pavement and the backs of my shoes. A trickle ran down my legs, and before the sun came up my vomit gushed onto the pavement in the middle of the ghetto. This went on for a few minutes before I gave up on the woman coming back and left. She could have the 14 bucks.

I continued to vomit on myself and let my bowels go on the drive home. “I’m going to die. I’m going to die,” I repeated to myself between retching and the expulsion of bile from my mouth. Warm liquid spread across the seat of my pants.

My father met me at the front door. He knew I had stolen the car and some money, but most of all he knew I was going to die from this sickness if I didn’t get to the hospital. My mother drove, and my father sat with me in the back seat. They wheeled me to the ER, where I talked the doctor into giving me some water. My dad told her not to give me any, and I puked it up like he said I would. Soon I was on the gurney in convulsions, in and out of consciousness.

“I’m about to sh\*t!” I managed to gurgle to my dad and the orderly through the vomit. The orderly and my dad hooked the back of my knees with their arms and pulled me up to slide the bedpan under me.

A doctor came in and belittled me for letting them put me on so much medicine in Oregon. I would have cursed him out, but it was too hard to talk and puke and convulse at the same time. He wrote an order for some dilaudid to abate the vomiting and diarrhea until I could get enough fluids to not die. I had only been home for 36 hours, but I had already stolen my mom’s car, 14 bucks from her purse, drunk a half-bottle of cough syrup, puked it up all over the interior of her Mercedes Benz, defecated on the seats, tried to score drugs in the ghetto and was currently puking and pooping to death on a gurney at seven in the morning.

Ya ya you shouldn't push in while tied but most do. Sometimes I hear a gurgling and feel the same when I don't get it off before I start pushing in.  I never use to. There's no reaction or pain. No blowing of veins. It happens on certain veins on both arms. I actually now know I hit when it happens. It's like its the shot bouncing off the tie or slowing down. It still goes through when tied.

I never could get through to users who thought their tie stopped all the shot so when they took it off they'd get it all at once....you'd have to tie off so tight you'd amputate to stop it from getting through.

I'm just wondering if anyone notices this. Smaller veins too. My big were fucked into komodo dragon scales long ago. Good thing tho? I can't hit it so the blood pumps through there like a champ.

I cheek the patches and last Tuesday after sleeping with a patch in my cheek I woke up at 5am for work and instantly threw 16mg sub under my tongue thinking I’d waited long enough.  AWEFUL.  As soon as I clocked on I knew something was up so made an excuse and dipped out.  Five hours later I still felt shitty and gave in and bought more dones.  Used about 30 mgs for four days and then one 75mg patch yesterday morning since my weekend is tomorrow and Tuesday.  Felt shitty this morning and in really mild withdrawal but didn’t want to take any opiates so I could dose Suboxone tomorrow.  So I took about 60 mgs of loperamide today at 3 pm and have been using kratom throughout the day and have some for tonight and if needed tomorrow.

I initially started with suboxone and had the worst stomach ache and headaches. Those morphed into chest and arm pain and just a super out of it and shitty feeling.

After two weeks of the symptoms getting worse I stopped taking the subs for two days and then talked to my doctor. Got an ekg that showed no issues and switched to subutex. Only tried those for two days and immediately felt ten times worse. Haven't taken any more bupe and the symptoms have slowly gotten better with each passing day. 

What's the deal? Everyone I know tolerates bupe with basically no major issues. I have tried just about every opiate/opiod available in the states and have never had any adverse effects. Sure some things I didn't enjoy like tramadol but never anything really bad.

Any one else just not able to tolerate bupe? Super unlucky since I am legit trying to get clean.",1534126980.0

Well I went golfing with some of my friends the other day, they bought me a few beers. 
This is where is falls apart. I thought I had everything under control. I did not. 

Those two beers led my alcoholic tendancys to unfold. I didn't stop drinking until today. I JUST COULD NOT STOP.  I felt as if I told myself thst I didn't buy heroin or oxy it's fine that I buy coke and liquor. 

I fucking hate myself right now. I'm not looking for sympathy cause I know I fucked up. I'm going to go to a NA meeting tonight and share my story but the guilt I feel is unbearable, I'm not suicidal but all I can think about is ending everything because I feel like the feeling will never end, I know this feeling will never go away, I will always want to get high or drunk, it was inevatble that I was going to relapse because I'm not myself when I'm sober.

I know that some of the high will be wasted because I did some this morning, but aside that, is there any danger I'm not thinking of. I know redosing isn't recommended, but will the amounts potentially be putting me in any danger?

96tcyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/96tcyr/successful_pof_cold_cop/,21,https://redd.it/96tcyr,Blackteacee,Successful POF Cold Cop!,"I typed this in advance because odds are I'm very lit right now if I'm posting this. This post turned out to be long lol beware. & Enjoy.

Typically a lurker/reader of this sub, and I drew inspiration from the cold cop stories. I've tried CL, Whisper and Tinder with 0 success which surprised me because I live in a fairly large urban city and less than 2 hours away from a well-known city with bountiful open markets. I searched the typical keywords on CL with no success, posted about 2 Whispers with no response and made a Tinder profile but a few swipes in and I knew it wouldn't be fruitful. I remember seeing a post about POF, so I decided to try it. BINGO.

This is my second attempt at cold copping, and it finally paid off. How I did it: I found a picture of myself that didn't show any identifiers like tattoos and didn't really show all of my face. I showed enough of myself where someone would be on the fence if I was catfish or not, but interested enough to message me. In order to weed out any people actually looking for love (lol), my tagline or the text that appeared next to my picture said ""looking for a plug only."" Plug is a more popular term in the black community where I live than connect (I'm a black female btw).

Next, weeding out messages. I wait for them to message me. I only respond to messages that start with ""what are you looking for,"" ""what kind of plug,"" ""what do you need"" or anything along those lines. I don't respond if they simply say ""hey beautiful"" or give me a random compliment because I don't want to give the impression that I'm actually interested in dating. I'm on a mission! Lol.

Maybe every 3 out of 10 messages ask me what I'm looking for. When I say that I'm looking for percs (I really mean just good ole oxy by its lonesome, but again - slang), maybe 1 of those 3 people follows up with ""how many"" ""what kind"" etc. I've made plans to meet up with a total of 3 or 4 people total (including both cold cop attempts) and all of them fell through because the person stopped responding after setting up a (public) place to meet and exchanging numbers. Disappointing but part of the game.

FINALLY, I found a person that followed through! He only had 15s, and he was selling them at $1 per mg. I've gotten offers for $8 per 15mg and $20 per 30mg before, but as I said, none of those offers came through. But I'm desperate at the moment since I haven't been high in a week or two, and I know that $1 per mg isn't abnormal. So I ask if he could do 7 for $100, but he only had 4 left. (It takes about ~40mg to get me high). The available quantity was disappointing but I didnt care. So I told him I'll buy all 4, for the normal $1 per mg price.

4 hours later he messages me and tells me he's mobile and meet him in 15. I met him by a random intersection of streets in the hood. He came to my window and waited. I flashed a smile and opened my palm to signify I wanted to see the pills before I gave him the money. They looked legit so I handed him the cash. He asked me if I smoked because he wanted to smoke me out, but I declined because my only drug vice is popping pills. I really don't fuck with weed because it gives me anxiety and alcohol gives me migraines. He tried asking me out but I told him I had to go, so he told me to keep in contact, then we parted ways and now I'm high. A love story. the end.

If you're curious about any other aspect of my cold cop, just ask. This is my first reddit post so sorry if I included too many unnecessary details lol.",1534116320.0

Daily I work towards small victories in this sober lifestyle. Living in a 3/4 house, I get randomly drug tested as part of their policy of residency. I don’t even smoke weed, which legally I can obtain a medical card, but under a federal VA rule I cannot smoke.


Small victories everyday. I bust my ass sweating buckets doing dirty manual labor all day, and without drugs I find I need to set up small things to look forward to. Instant gratification is something as addicts we altered in our brains. Dopamine in our brains is lacking without drugs, and drugs ruled over food, sleep, safety, and relationships. Heroin puts us in an animal state where dope is number one. 

I find what I have to do to live a semi fulfilling life is to set up small victories for gratification purposes. All day I’m working, I try to glorify taking a nice shower to clean up, and thinking about what movie or show I want to watch to try to have something to look forward to. Even if it means not smoking all day to get back and enjoy a cigarette after a hard days work, that small victory helps me with the monotony of life.

I’m sure normal people get more fulfillment from things, and are able to think outside that box and socialize and achieve things higher up in the hierarchy of needs as per Maslows triangle. But as addicts, we have to live a different lifestyle, and many of us turn to drugs because we see the ceiling of society and just say fuck that. Working every single day to pay out all your income to bills and rent is not a life we want. We opened Pandora’s box and felt the euphoria of heroin and now know there is another, easier way to live. But in the end, that life leads to misery. 

I’m ranting, just wanted to say, life is boring and living sober we see what’s really to be of our lives. It’s hard to live sober after use, but small victories and achievable goals help get through the day. I just hope I can stay the course. I’m still in that addict mindset of living day to day, and I don’t like it.

When that ended, it started a six year run almost with heroin. During my senior year of university I got arrested for sales and distribution and got 18 months while being kicked out of school. California good time made that nine months and it was the only time in those past six years that I was clean. 

I got out about two years ago and for all intents and purposes, I got my life back together if you ask anyone that knows. I went back to school and now I'm on the other side of the country in Ohio but I never stopped using. I just used less. When I finally transferred back from community college to where I am now, that was always my ""expiration date"". Once I get there, I'll stop. Once I'm back to where I was before everything went to shit. The change in scenery would help I always reasoned and since leaving a few weeks ago, I've been clean for the first time in seven years. But it's miserable.

Logically, I recognize that at one point I must have been normal but now it's all so dreadfully boring. I am going through the motions because it's expected of me but I am miserable and unhappy. I haven't been physically sick in a couple weeks. I'm sleeping again. But I'm in a new city and all I do is wake up and watch tv and have trouble getting out of bed. Everyone keeps congratulating me and I try to be happy and tell them thank you but I want to puke from the banality and nonsense of it all. 

I'm not sure I even want to be sober but I know I'm suppose to be. I did a year of out patient meetings before leaving to come here (despite the fact that I used through it all) and it wasn't for me. I met good people but couldn't stand the fakeness of it all. Hell, I got high with half the people I met there. I kept trying to say I was going to quit the week before I moved but I used until the night before I left for my now second trip university, definitely older this time but obviously not wiser. My first seven days here were miserable. The first night I finally slept, I was genuinely ecstatic. I honestly woke up positively thinking, more than just thinking I could do it, but that I wanted to do it. I went for an appointment at the school and got outside for the first time and then a day or two later the feelings I am describing now started to kick in.

School starts August 21st. The idea of sitting through engineering and mathematics or of leaving and doing anything just seems like something I'm not interested in. But I'm not interested in anything. I was watching a powerful documentary called Amy on Netflix that followed the life of Amy Winehouse from childhood to death through home videos and after she got clean and won the grammys and everyone around her was congratulating her, she told her best friend that this was all so fucking boring without drugs. She died a little bit later. That's the best way to describe how I feel. Not the dying. I'm not suicidal. But life is fucking boring and yet I know this is normal. At one point I was happy with normal. 

I know enough to know that my brain is fucked, chemically, and in all likelihood just isn't producing enough chemicals to balance me out because it was use to being flooded all the time by the heroin. But knowing something logically doesn't help deal with it and I don't know where to go from here. Whether I should say fuck expectations and try to find something here or if I can deal with this. When I was physically ill, it's strange but I was determined. ""Fuck you sickness. I'm stronger than you."" Now not so much,  especially because there seems to be no logical conclusion. I've read everything from this lasting thirty days for some to literally never ending for others. 

At a time I should be happy and everyone around me is happy, I am miserable.",1534097562.0

since then ive been taking a few scoops of kratom at night, and waking up in goosebumps that are taken care of with a single 2mg immodium, for the rest of the day

i recently noticed that when i took a small dose of kratom (1-3g of green malay, usually i have like 6g of red but ran out), ill get that nice warm glow for 1-6 hrs depending on the dose, but then when it wears off i get goosebumps straight away! (with low doses of the green strain anyways, with red ones and in a decent dose-- im good for like 12 hrs)

i took some loperamide after (2mg), and then 4mg more cos i had trouble sleeping when my kratom ran out-- goosebumps vanish, but then after a single 1g dose of kratom (scraped the bag lmao), they returned 1h after the dose wore off!

ended up taking 16mg of loperamide yesterday, since it kept getting knocked off my receptors with the miniscule doses of kratom i was taking at seperate intervals-- when usually just 2mg does the trick for the whole day

I sometimes enjoy prepping a nice moderate speedball and walking my dog to the local park to find a nice quiet spot to shoot before the walk home. Well, tonight as I was prepping the hit I happened to notice my little ziploc baggy (the 1"" x 1"" size) was closed but sitting in a small puddle of condensation from where my water bottle sat just earlier. I immediately snatched it up and looked through the non-graphic/clear side to see that, while 99% of it was dry, there was a bit of water that had found tiny holes in the crevasses of the bags edges and some had begun to dissolve into mush. I dumped the  bag onto a small plastic card, and eventually got the dry coke into a new bag while a bit of this mush was left behind stuck to the card. ""Waste not, want not"" I told myself as I scraped this remainder into my mixer, added a bit of tar, and (this was where I fucked up) decided to add just a liiiitle more coke, two very small pebbles...

What you have to understand at this point is that, when crystalline solids dissolve into a solvent, their physical volume begins to mean nothing.. I can dissolve a gram of blow and a milligram of blow in the same amount of water and give you two syringes. One will likely kill you, the other likely wont have any effect. So while I assumed that this small pittance of wet coke deserved some additional company (more coke), it could have in fact already been perhaps 4 or 5 times my normal dose. I didnt watch it begin to dissolve and didnt note the weight of my coke before and after it was removed to see how much was actually there.

So I walk to the park, crouch down to 'tie my shoe,' tie off, hit on my first poke (which is quite an achievement when you've been slamming tar multiple times a day for a year),  and slowly push the whole lot in. I normally push half and wait a few moments to see how I feel before doing the rest, but I was pushing slow enough to avoid slipping out of the vein that when I got to the halfway point and didnt feel that overwhelmed  I just decided to inject the rest (this was my second mistake).

I knew I was in for it when I immediately felt a new, strong pressure in my lower abdomen. Then I heard the squealing laughter of  children playing even though I looked around and saw no children.. I felt pressure build up in my right eadrum like when you're descending in an airplane. Everything was fuzzy. The words and images on my phone waved, pulsated, and the white background on the Google homepage looked like static on an old TV with no channel dialed in.. the ringing was insane. Every time i shifted my gaze I would see a new hallucination in my peripheral vision. A few times I would actually see my hallucination front and center and it would relate to my surroundings, but then would disappear after a few moments; like a little girl chasing after my dog, or a gardner picking weeds by the fence. I actually began to worry though once i started getting black spots in my vision like when you stand up too fast or are about to pass out. I sat down in the grass and began to evaluate my symptoms and assess for signs of stroke or heart attack. I forgot to bring my little blood pressure cuff, that would have been good to see,  I would have probably measured over 170/100 really. Ive never had such a strong rush ever and Ive measured higher.. I had no trouble reading, talking, moving. No weakness or tingling, nothing. So I got up and we started walking home.

The effects lingered for a couple hours. I'd see people disappearing around corners in the edges of my vision and occasionally hear muffled voices outside even though nobody was around. The small print on my phone would sometimes wiggle or disappear for a second, and random objects sitting on the table would move to different places and back. I honestly believe had I added a little bit more coke that I would have stroked out. Thanks for reading! And learn from my mistakes! Be safe!

I was too lazy to do a CWE most of the time so I'd just swallow the 9 pills whole. This worked, and it gave me a decent buzz, but it was always accompanied with a nasty headache. I could never understand why that happened until one day I figured out it must be the fucking 3000mg of APAP I took. 

After that I started doing CWE more often, but whenever I did the high felt weaker. It turns out I wasn't leaving the solution in the fridge long enough for the APAP to settle out. After I perfected my method, I started getting waaaaaay better results; a good mellow high with no headache. It's such a damn shame I didn't figure this out earlier. I must have wasted at least 80 of the pills before I got the CWE method right. 

Anyways, I scored some more today after weeks of being dry and I'm feeling content as the sweet Vicodin begins to run through my veins :)",1534049219.0

It came in a package similar to Zubsolv and was labeled as 32 mg buprenorphrine. Allegedly it was traded to him by a terminally ill cancer patient for about a gram and a half of girl, and it was used to taper off an absurd daily dose of fentanyl. Sold it to somebody for $100, didn't think anything else of it. Looked it up recently, and I can't find any single pill close to that dose in the US. Has anyone else seen one of these?

Hate all the egotistical fake douche bags.

I hate myself. I want to get sober so bad but I just can’t seam to find a reason too.

All but two had been broken or gotten wet with all the food and vomit in the fight.,"Now, it may seem hard to believe that I would have been able to hide my whole body under the pillows on the bed, but remember, everything in the apartment was over sized, like it all belonged to a giant. There were even bigger throw pillows besides. When the owner of the place returned to his room, I could see the giant from under them. He wore a tan colored trench coat which he stripped off as soon as he entered the bedroom and sat with his back to me. He watched TV. There seemed to be no neck. Fuzzy strands of hair stuck out from the cratered back of his skull. The man wore a gown of his own flesh, which hung in ugly folds of white skin, and an even worse smell seemed to emanate from whatever strange bacterial cultures I imagined to be growing under those flaps of fat. The white comforter seemed visibly soiled anywhere his naked skin touched it. *This is what I get.* I thought. *This is what I get for doing meth with Chandra and letting Rufus talk me into running into some strange, stinky room.* It also occurred to me that most people wouldn't ever find themselves in a situation like this just because they went to an office party.  No.  This kind of ridiculousness was unique to life with Rufus.

He pulled a box from under the bed and produced two plastic dolls. The TV played in front of him. His silhouette played with the figurines. It was as unsettling and strange an event as I have ever witnessed in my life. The giant man began to speak for the figurines. One had a cockney accent and the other spoke with the voice of a girl in high school. There was conversation about the things they were wearing and plans for later. It was just the kind of thing you’d expect to see a child doing privately in their playroom, but it was this middle aged colossal cretin.

I would have laughed, but he passed gas, which was so revolting that I immediately began to gag. My body went limp. It was like this time I got food poisoning from this box of chow Mein an old lady gave me only this was worse. And whatever ability the gargantuan man had to articulate imaginary conversations between his Ken and Barbie dolls seemed to be lost as he pulled back the pillows to find me spewing vomit the consistency of creamy oatmeal onto the floor. He let out an angry bellow. He shouted wet and gargled words I couldn’t understand. He grabbed my hair. My body came up off the mattress like he was picking up a piece of clothing.

I tried to fight. I was too weak though and too sick. The smell of his fart had started me gagging and the smells in the rest of the apartment were now causing an involuntary retching which they hadn’t before. We ended up in the kitchen. He smashed the cabinet doors with my head. At some point he threw me on the ground, opened the refrigerator door and toppled it over onto me. Jars of jelly and old cardboard containers of rotten take out fell on me. Then, he picked me up by the neck. Just one of his hands held me up against the wall slowly choking me to death, but he let out an angry shout like some mythological creature who lived under a bridge. His breath led to more puke. It poured out of my nose. I swallowed some of it and struggled to breathe.

It’s funny the things you think about when your life’s being taken from you. There I was dying slowly as this man choked me to death. The place smelled terrible. I was pretty sure that I’d crapped my pants a little bit. It was an embarrassing scenario and an even more embarrassing way to die, but my mind kept telling me that there was honey spilled down my back and in my hair. I don’t think I ever told you that about me, but sticky things, like jelly or syrup or honey on my skin, drive me absolutely crazy. It was like whatever part of my brain that hated it so much was completely uninterested in my imminent death and only cared about getting that stickiness off my skin. Brains are weird like that.

Before all oxygen flow to my brain was cut and my eyes closed, Rufus smiled from over my opponent’s shoulder. He held a frying pan. He opened his eyes wide and the dull thud of cast iron against the back of my assailant’s skull let out in the kitchen. The giant crumpled to the ground. It took us a few minutes to get out of there, because somehow, I’d gotten stuck under him when we fell. We left the loot we’d originally intended to steal and stopped to collect ourselves once we got back to the freedom and fresh air on the streets.

I pulled my pack of cigarettes out. All but two had been broken or gotten wet with all the food and vomit in the fight. Rufus took them from me. He lit them and passed on back to me. We sat on the curb smoking.

“SHHHEEEEWOOOOO!!!!” He said giggling.

“I know.”

“Man, oh, man!”

“That was nuts!”

“I know.”

“We’ll be telling that story for years.”

It was getting to be midnight, so we walked back up to our spot. We passed a fat man in a brand-new rain poncho and combat boots. The man banged a staff like Gandolf and demanded drugs from passersby. Everyone knew he was a cop, and no one messed with him. The streets are like that. There’s some unspoken release of information dispersed among us about undercovers and the like, the same way bees all know how to act in unison. They don’t talk. They just know, and so did we.

Back at the spot Rufus and I did our shots. We nodded. Before the sun came up, the cops were kicking me in the leg and telling us we had to go.",1534047909.0

I’ll lay it out for you, but also for my own benefit in a therapeutic sense. I’m not gonna give you my life story, I’m not gonna give you a sob story about how I wasn't raised well, I’m not gonna tell you about belt buckles ripping up my back and damn well near getting infected. I’m gonna start you off the night of, and fucking well leave it there. It’s a story that happened in 3 minutes, and will take me a 12-chapter book to fully chronicle. I can’t prove any of this to you, but I can assure you it DID happen, and I DID go to a place in the perfect, sweet median between life and elsewhere.

Then without any more bullshit, here’s my tall tale.

We sat in a parking lot. Doesn’t matter where exactly. But it was in the “less nice” side of DC. The side where you can see the Washington Monument, yet recognize that you are existing in the shadow of it. Where tenant buildings crumble and young adults puff blunts on the staircases, brutally ignorant of their potential, yet fully self-aware of their worth weighed by the neglect of their community. Where tens of millions are quickly poured without second thought into the beauty and prestige of a capital that they hardly take a part of.

The reason I was down here was to score. Score some heroin to be exact. That’s something that your narrator hasn’t been too upfront yet. I have quite a turbulent relationship with thoat powder, rock, cap, tar, and the sticky gunk with specks in it that you can’t be too sure about. It’s love-hate, you know? But it’s something I’ve been loyal to and won’t go on leaving without a proper fight and messy custody hearing.

I won’t go into names here, so let me make that clear. The driver pulled into a spot where the overarching streetlight would be ideally placed to illuminate the neglected car’s interior. This was meant to allow use without sticking out in this place (it was relatively busy for a Tuesday night). I mixed up a small little pile of white, sloshed it around with the contents of an old hot water bottle, and drew it up through my rig (or a needle, for you normies).

When I pierced the easy-access vein on the top of my left arm, I dumped half of the murky red water in, and waited like I usually do out of some half-assed sense of safety. I usually wait for the rush to plateau before I clear out the whole barrel. This way, I wouldn’t literally kill my brain with pleasure. It’s a habit I’ve maintained progressively less and less out of convenience and no real close calls. I slumped down into the seat, my joints falling away from each other into an infinite, sublime, warm comfort. A few seconds too early, I finished off my hit. 

The rush from the first half was still rising - the second hadn’t had time to start yet. I knew I was in trouble, and tried to make a sound. A dry groan pushed its way out of my lip but by then I was already well and properly fucked. I kept climbing higher, higher, higher… a pause where all I saw was the back of the passenger seat, and then *black*.

Here’s where the “real” story begins.

I never really blacked out, though.

You know when you’re laying in bed? On the brim of sleep with your eyes shut, picturing yourself falling down? The moment before you hit, your body wildly jerks, although you’re fully aware it was all imagined. That’s how I came to. My high totally left me, I felt myself on the cusp of sobering up completely and the withdrawals were setting in - maybe it was panic. Naw, not this. This was inexplicable.

“Welcome to the New Way of Life meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, my name is -”

But it wasn’t my sudden sobriety that concerned me. It was the sudden change of scenery, and the change of scenery to the possibly worst place on this earth: an AA meeting.

Surveying my surroundings, I found a half-full room with heavy cigarette tar plastering already yellow and peeling wallpaper. Lights were dim, with one of the brightest bulbs flickering in 15-second sporadic bursts. It was epilepsy-inducing. Pretty aged and haggard characters in the front took long turns saying stuff, but I couldn’t hear all that well. A light, drilling hum quickly began, and subsequently worsened inside my head. No sound could penetrate this barrier. Occupant sharing this room with me were sparse. It wasn’t too easy to study them from lighting that seemed to cut plenty corners, but it was mostly men - maybe 5:1 ratio men to women. 

Shit... my back muscles began to start spinning into a fishing reel which pulled my whole body along like puppet string. Skin over my face contracted, probably giving me a hollowed appearance over my cheekbones. Maybe not - probably not. Felt awfully like that, though.

So, where the fuck was I? That’s what I wondered while my heart rate jacked. One moment I’m in a car, and the next thing I know I’m here. I can’t hear. I can hardly see. The ringing subsided - well, a bit. I could hear the man talking up front.

“Let’s welcome our speaker all the way from Anzio, Italy.”

Maybe two people clapped, the rest murmured. 

The collection basket was passed around.

“Boot - alcoholic.” That’s how the speaker introduced himself.

“Boot.” The crowd repeated in a monotone drone.

I could hardly hear the speaker, and struggled to pick up any bits or pieces. The ringing in my ears dissipated like a fog, but only slightly.

Tuning in, I realized that I missed the first, maybe, 15 minutes. As far as a life story goes, he was somewhere in his early adulthood.

“So, like I said, my father kind of groomed me for the family business.”

The basket inched closer, haphazardly thrown to whoever was on the right like a game of frugal hot potato.

“I did the best that I could.”

An aged wooden bin, woven together with gnarled oak sticks landed on my lap - hard. Startled, I looked down. Facing back up at me was the pale head of a fair-faced women. Hair white and elaborately knotted. Nose slender and rounded at the bottom. Her mouth mocked some semblance of words, but it was futile. Some victim of decapitation. Dried blood crusted in mounds under her, as the mouth continued working. No words and no air escaped. Powder covered her face sloppily, which left a long-dried trail of tears down her cheeks. She looked to be some kind French royalty, recalling a high school history class where I hardly paid any attention at all.

My eyes teared up, I swallowed hard down on rising vomit. That vinegar taste of stomach acid coated my throat. 

Trying to disregard the very-much conscious head inside, I tossed I placed it carefully two chairs to my right. 

“My reign, slowly devolved, I guess you could say.”

I harshly snorted the creeping mucus trying to escape back up into my burning sinuses.

“I fell into a slow decadence. The leisure of public office took front seat of the chariot.”

I looked around, careful as fuck, mind you. Panic made my breaths deeper, yet more shallow. Anxiety gripped at that magic nerve that connects the brain to spazzing muscles. The room was larger than I first thought, maybe ballroom-sized with rows of chairs facing towards the dark reddish wooden podium. Closest person was behind me to my right, two rows back. It was probably obvious, I admit, but I had to study his face. He was clothed in a puffy leather jacket, ruined by time and neglect. With arms crossed and his head down, I assumed he was asleep. As hard as I looked, I tried making out his face but all I could see was his stringy, sparse head of hair.

“Responsibility went by the wayside. My palace soon devolved into wine-fueled orgies. The construction project from my bridge drained the royal coffers. Bodies started to rack up. Couldn’t be too careful.”

Jesus Christ, where was I? This is Hell. I knew this had to be Hell.

“While I walked through one of my passageways, shadows casted by the crackling torches, one of my guards approached me. One of my Praetorian guards emerged from a side tunnel, knife in hand - I think it was Cassius. Anyway, a mob of them dressed in the height of fashion, plunged their knives in and out of my abdomen with animalistic grunts. I laid on that cold, black floor for what felt like hours before the torchlight extinguished. Now hear I am.”

Without noise or warning, a bony hand suddenly gripped down on my right shoulder like a vice. Call it imagination, but the fingers creaked like an antique door hinge. To be frank, it hurt like shit. Snapping my head to face the attacker, it was the man in the leather jacket. His facial features were soldered together, leaving his right eyelid to hang from his nose, lips nonexistent which bore bluish grey fractured teeth. Ridges and hard-set lines were the apparent signature left by a raging fire.

Words slithered out from his dead throat, which rang raspier than nails against chalkboard.

“A newcomer, eh? You think that’s bad!? I burnt alive in a car crash. My grandson with me, at that! Took about ten minutes ‘till I died!”

I remember vaguely springing up with his hand still in place, a wet crackling noise eliciting from his shoulder socket. With that, the hand eased off and I bolted toward the back exit. The speaker stopped, and I could see out of the corner of my eyes all of the ghouls watching me.

Putting all of my weight into it, I leaned sideways and slammed into the bar of the metal atrium door. Thankfully, it gave way, and I kept sprinting. Took a few seconds to realize I was running back TOWARDS the podium. Like some mirror of space and matter, I was propelled in the opposite direction. Spinning around, this happened maybe 15 more times until I eventually stopped dead in my tracks.

Nobody spoke or moved. They all stared at the sudden intruder who just became totally self-aware of his situation. The speaker has a furious scowl warping his face. Towering over me, he walked slowly in my direction. I couldn’t move, no matter how hard I tried to lift either one of my legs. He lumbered closer and closer. Transfixed on his stroll, he was suddenly upon me, grabbing my tan shirt and pushing me to the ground. I realized very quickly that I couldn’t breathe. the fall knocked the air clean out of me. Gasping for air, the speaker’s face was mere inches away from mine. I was sure that this would be it. 

“That was awfully rude,” he said. 

I tried shaking my head “no” wildly - scared literally to death.

“If you’re gonna -”

The man didn’t get to finish his sentence, but his faced cleared into a look of near-shock and a voice that sounded awfully like a woman escaped his lips.

“Administering another dose.” 

I sucked in a massive breath of air, filling my pained lungs. In that moment, my surroundings were made entirely clear to me. Sharp white light blinded me, and I leaned off the side of the gurney to vomit - much to the relief of my captors.

That very same voice that I heard moments before asked me, 

“Do you know where you are?”

“Yes... I’m in the back of an ambulance, aren’t I?”",1534040539.0

I have a prescription bottle for two weeks of my subutex,  and a letter stating that I’m prescribed it, but I’ve got about six months of extra medication that I have saved up and don’t have a prescription bottle for. I’ve never had issues traveling with pills before, but I decided to look into it anyway. I’ve seen some posts on here asking about traveling with pills, so here’s what TSA has to say about traveling domestically within the US with medication. The main highlight is that TSA does NOT require you to keep your medication in the original prescription container. 

 - You can bring your medication in pill or solid form in unlimited amounts as long as it is screened.
Medication in liquid form is allowed in carry-on bags in excess of 3.4 ounces in reasonable quantities for the flight. It is not necessary to place medically required liquids in a zip-top bag. However, you must tell the officer that you have medically necessary liquids at the start of the screening checkpoint process. Medically required liquids will be subjected to additional screening that could include being asked to open the container.

- You can travel with your medication in both carry-on and checked baggage. It’s highly recommended you place these items in your carry-on in the event that you need immediate access.

- TSA does not require passengers to have medications in prescription bottles, but states have individual laws regarding the labeling of prescription medication with which passengers need to comply.

- Medication is usually screened by X-ray; however, if a passenger does not want a medication X-rayed, he or she may ask for an inspection instead. This request must be made before any items are sent through the X-ray tunnel.

I just did a traditional speedball (good cocaine and good heroin injected intravenously) and felt compelled to write about my love of them. At some point it started rhyming so I just went with it. Let me say that speedballs are absurdly dangerous and deadly and I'm not saying they ARE better than most of these things just that they feel better. Don't do heroin ppl. Don't do IV  cocaine either but for the love of jj please don't mix them and bang that shit. Do as I say not as I do.

I've taken 2 Xanax bars (1 around 11 am and another around 5pm) and a big shot of boy around 7 am, a big speedball around 11 am, a speedball w a normal amount of h and heavy bit of girl around 11:30 am, another h light girl heavy speedball at 2pm, another at 4pm and a big one around 6:20 pm. I'm probably going to do another big one (biggest of the day) around 9 or 10 with another bar then go to bed around 11 or 12 whenever the coke fades. I have a decent tolerance to boy and girl but not xans. I really want to steal the declaration of independence or crown jewels but idk where the declaration of independence is and I don't think my country has crown jewels unless they stole some other countries crown jewels and they're hidden away somewhere top secret like that warehouse from Indiana Jones.

so i gave 2 to my friends, hit the pipe, and took 4 or maybe 5 pills. i didnt realize how dangorous it is to fuck about with these pills, but because i didnt notice any affect, so i thought they were duds, and just popped a handful down my guzzler. half hour later, i remember feeling paralized. awake, but anable to move any part of my body, except the middle and index finger of my left hand.

now i was trying to speak to my friends, but i was like dicaprio in the wolfe of wall street after popping the ludes. all i could do was dribble. then i blacked out.

It wasn’t because he wanted to eat it. He just knew it was what people did at parties and was doing his best to look normal.","I sat up. “I’m not crying.” I said.

He told me he was sick. I forgot all about the Faceless One and Ally Alcoholic and everything Jimbo told me. Rufus had been through booking the day before and once he was booked they released him. A big city like that doesn’t have the resources to keep people jailed for minor things. The warrant was for an old shoplifting ticket and an unpaid fine. It wasn’t ever getting paid. The city knew that. We knew that. That’s just how it was. Next time they saw Rufus and recognized him, they’d run his name, and he’d go to jail again to be booked and released.

I showed him what I’d gotten from Jimbo and Fin the day before for Bug’s eye. He ran in place and let out a giddy laugh. It took him a few minutes to fix it all up, but once he did, he told me we were going to an office party that evening.

“An office party?”

“Yeah. Fat Channy wants us to go.” Those were his last words before he fell asleep. When the cops came I already had him over my shoulder and was walking across the street to the park where we usually spent the first parts of our days.

Chandra, or Fat Channy as we called her, had been off the streets for the last 9 months. There was no need for her to have that nickname, as there weren’t any other Chandras or Channys around to differentiate from. She was fat though and didn’t seem to mind. In the summertime she wore sleeveless dresses, so you could see where she’d been damaged in a fiery car wreck on the freeway years before. Paper bag flesh covered the unsightly striations and knots of scar tissue like chicken bone gristle holding her together inside. She wore braces made of metal rods and black Velcro. Most of her face had been left intact but for the crenulate trough of missing meat running from her neck and up into the cheek where veins and tendons had been borrowed. She looked lonely and hurt. Her eyes were kind and teeth pretty the few times she ever smiled.

We first started seeing her come around Pill Hill year or so before, always trying to trade or sell her Ativan and Vicodin for something better. On top of the accident, she’d been born with some disease the details of which were unclear but that’d given her rights to a lifetime supply of prescriptions for low grade pain killers and anxiety meds and antidepressants. She liked heroin and did meth sometimes. Unlike us though, she could keep an apartment and job. Her visits to the streets were always desperate but short lived. She never spent the night.

But somehow someone talked her into smoking crack. That was it for her. She’d kept her life together while using for some time, but less than a week after she hit the rock, she was living outside like the rest of us. Her health got worse. Rufus and I adopted her as a third in our party for a short while and pushed her new wheelchair for her. One day, her father came to get her. He put her in rehab. She’d gotten a job as a secretary and lived in a halfway house. We were her only friends and would now be her guests at the party for her office.

It was a regular day for us. Rufus nodded out. We sat on the sidewalk or on benches. When he was awake our heads swiveled on our necks back and forth like spectators at a tennis match. We watched the passing pedestrians. The city offered so much for us to see in a single sitting. There was a transsexual in red, horsehair extensions and Dorothy’s blue checkered vest from the Wizard of Oz and black leather combat boots. A street artist painted for a crowd. Another played drums on empty five-gallon buckets. Pigeons scavenged the sidewalks as dirty and desperate as we were. There were strange conversations. A 50-year-old man cried into his phone that his mother was too mean, that he wouldn’t give her this kind of power any more. The prettiest girl we saw that day wore face paint and talked to herself. Rufus drooled. He nodded. I bought a pack of Reds, which was half gone in a couple of hours. As the day cooled off and evening approached, Rufus woke up for good. He was ready to go to the party. We walked towards the address.

“Now, when we get there, Boom Boom. We have to look normal. Ya know? Channy’s supposed to be doing well and all that, and she is, but you know, people like her coworkers, straight laced types don’t expect people like us to be coming to their parties. It’s vital that we seem as normal as is possible, my dear Boom Boom.”

I shook my head. “I know, Roof. I know. What’s that?”

He was bringing what looked like a Xanax bar to his lips with his fingers. “Xanax.”

“WHAT? After everything you just said?” This was Rufus’s super power. We all had superhuman powers as street addicts. Not that they were particularly helpful or did anything but hurt us, but they were things most humans couldn’t accomplish. Like this, with Rufus, the ability to hold within himself such glaring contradictions in thought, word and deed simultaneously and to be at such peace about it was extraordinary. He would have been a great cartoon character.

Needless to say, the party was a disaster for the first hour we were there. Not because of me though. Obviously, our grease caked pores and the raggedy seams of the fabric on our clothes and bags made our homelessness and drug addiction hard to hide. Fat Channy had been giving me worried looks as soon as she saw us. Perhaps she never considered how awkward it would be to have us there. But there we were. Rufus would try to hide his nods by picking up random objects and holding them to his face, like he was reading or studying them. He nodded off mid conversation with Chandra’s boss. From time to time I heard him telling the partygoers about how his last girlfriend had ripped him off or asking what they thought about how hard it was to find a public restroom in the city anymore. He didn’t realize that these were problems homeless drug addicts have. Regular people didn’t have these issues. Later, he tried to cut a piece of cheesecake. It wasn’t because he wanted to eat it. He just knew it was what people did at parties and was doing his best to look normal. Channy and I watched horrified. The piece Rufus cut was a lopsided square from the middle of the cake. He nodded out in the middle of transferring it to his plate and stood asleep in the way of everyone who came to get something from the drink and food bar.

Eventually, though, everyone was drunk. No one was lucid enough to notice or care that Rufus and I were obviously street people. Chandra didn’t feel embarrassed by it. Strings of lights kept the place dim and set the mood. Brains saturated in ethyl alcohol let loose from their lips low toned and lustful murmurings. Channy sat next to me on the couch. I put my arm around her, and she put her head on my shoulder. There was a stifled outburst of snorting laughter from another room. The cold metal rods of her leg brace pushed into my knee. Rufus had disappeared.

Channy whispered to me. “I got some meth.”

“What?” I shook my head. As cold and calloused as the streets were and as ruthless and ridiculous as I’d become, I had no desire to watch this girl throw her life away again. Maybe it was an attachment developed from all that time we pushed her wheelchair around. Or maybe it was a latent affection for the hope she gave me. She got off the streets. She was sober and had a job.

Fat Channy wasn’t well, though. She could die if she started using again, but she was persistent. It was all we knew of each other and the means of our closest bonding. We locked the door to the bathroom and put the lid on the toilet down. She pulled out the bag and an old Kohl’s credit card to crush it up and snort. She bowed before it and pulled some into her nostrils. Then, I did. After that, I told her about my heroin. She insisted even harder than before that I share, which I did. Channy puked in the toilet.

It was getting late, and as we walked back out into the party, I wondered where Rufus had disappeared to. The front door opened. He walked in and whispered to me.

“I gotta show you something.” He was staring at a drunk man in a nice button up shirt and loosened tie dancing by himself in the middle of the party. Everyone else had either left or slumbered in each other’s arms or made out.

We walked through the halls and up the stairs a few stories and came out on a level that had apartments. Apparently, he’d been prowling and ended up in one of them. Channy stayed back. That was the last we saw of her for a while. Rufus came to the door. He stooped and looked at me wide eyed with his pointer finger on his lips. He said it had been unlocked.

Inside the first thing I noticed was an unbearable stench. We crept around. Everything in the apartment seemed to be disproportionately large. The living room was covered in a foot or more of empty tallboys. There were smears of feces and blood on the floor which had been sprinkled over with sawdust rather than cleaned up. A bowl of fruit loops had been shattered against the wall. The cereal stuck solidified to the wall and floor. Grey colored bathwater sat an inch below a ring of grime on the tub. A giant pair of white briefs with thick brown streaks in the seat sat wrinkled on the floor by the toilet. Rufus pulled me into the bedroom and pointed to a piece of gold bullion on a mantle above the head of the bed. I jumped onto the bed. It was higher than most other beds I’d been on. It was also perfectly made and clean, unlike everything else in the apartment. The extra soft mattress, or maybe it was a waterbed, and comforter made it almost impossible to crawl across it. I was stuck.

I turned to Rufus and tried to tell him, but before I spoke, the front door opened. It bounced off the spring stop. Someone with a gruff voice cleared their throat, and elephantine footsteps could be felt in the floor. It was whoever owned the place. They were home.",1534003963.0

96g1i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/96g1i1/homeless/,25,https://redd.it/96g1i1,PillMomThrow,Homeless.,"I'm again writing this post from a homeless shelter. It's 7:15am, 15 minutes after drinking my mixed drink with 5g of Green Maeng Da. I don't like to make excuses for the things I need to do to survive, but I do have a physical ailment which is made better by taking kratom. At the end of the day, however, if I'm popping morphine every single day or chugging powdered leaf every 4 hours does any of that really matter? I didn't seem to when I was on it. I withdrew between doses like any good junkie, even when taken as directed I was just fucking gone the entire time I was on the pills.       
       
I was in the department of social services building a few days ago and didn't have the opportunity to weigh out my dose, and was being told if I didn't get a call back within 2 hours I would be sleeping on the street as it's not below a certain temperature outside. My mind was racing, I couldn't focus on anything thinking about how I would keep my bags safe around a group of about 30 homeless people who looked absolutely terrifying. It's kind of funny to me that I'm so scared of homeless people despite the fact that I had become one of them.        
       
I walked into the bathroom past the two cops and large sign which read ""DRUG USE IS NOT ALLOWED AND WILL BE GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. THOSE CAUGHT BREAKING THIS RULE WILL BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.      
       
Or something.         
        
My bags were heavier than I could handle, my back was screaming after the 7 hours between the last dose as I walked away from my bags and into the bathroom. I wasn't particularly worried about getting robbed, but it was a very real concern. I knocked on the door and heard no response, but through the crack of the stall door I saw a metal spoon sitting with a small gooey black dot in the middle on the toilet paper dispenser. I immediately darted my eyes away, backed up, and walked to the next stall. Jesus fucking Christ if I can see that how the fuck do you think the guard who is about to walk in is about to react?       
           
I had stayed in a general homeless shelter the night before. Every 10 minutes or so another person would walk out of the bathroom and stumble out to their table with a taped ball of cotton on their forearm. They had ripped my bags apart looking for any drugs, stealing my quarter oz of hemp flower. It didn't make any sense that so many people got drugs in without issue. I tried as hard as possible not to look at anyone in the eye, a good 3/4 of the people in that shelter were very obviously drugged heavily. I want to say that was the scariest night of my life, but my mom was actually a lot more serious of a pillhead. I had suspected she would overdose very soon now that she didn't have me to steal pills from. I put myself on kratom a few years back when I discovered 8 stolen scripts later that she didn't like it. She would keep telling me to go back to the pain center, somehow not realizing that I knew what she was doing.         
       
Back to the social service building. I quickly spooned 2 large scoops of powder into my mouth and chased them down with a small water bottle of fermented cranberry juice. I wanted to vomit immediately, but I didn't haven't even a little extra kratom so this wasn't even an option at all. I gagged and a few minutes later I felt the nausea start to pass. I hadn't eaten anything in almost 2 days. Well, aside from kratom of course.      
      
Within a half hour I started to feel not good. I'm sitting in this building surrounded by methadone maintenance patients, straight up junkies, and whatever else walked into the office begging for a handout. Some needed it, some were very upfront about their situation and didn't. I don't really know how to describe why I felt so much different than all these people, but in the last year I had spent less than $200 on all of my drugs. I don't mean to sound so holier than thou, but seeing my mom absolutely destroy her life and manipulate her son's to get an unending amount of pills really made me feel anxious I would end up exactly like her. It had been far too late when I started to see the signs, I was already heavily dependant on morphine and was worried there was no undoing the damage I had done.      
        
I get called into the interview room, barely being able to carry my three bags one at a time, leaving spaces of time where robbing me would've been child's play. When I came back to grab the third and final bag, the woman next to me had completely nodded out over it, slumping down face first into a metal bench and not moving no matter how hard I tried. I called the guard over and he quickly deduced that she was having an overdose. Her heart had stopped earlier, and at this point there was very little hope she would be brought back. He pulled my bag out from under her now lifeless body and handed it to me, seemingly unphased as he called an ambulance. Nobody around us seemed to care. Whatever, I looked forward and walked away.        
       
I sat down in the office and heard my social worker talking and couldn't really focus on anything she said. I knew she was trying to get me into another shelter. I knew she kept handing me things to sign, but past that I couldn't place any specifics. I started to realize I had severely overdosed myself. I've been taking kratom for quite some time now, and the biggest plus is that I barely feel it. I couldn't ever get that kind of thing from pills, and the side effects of the pills nearly killed me a few times. Everything was a blur.          
       
In this moment though, none of that mattered. I was nodding off, not anywhere near what pills do even at low doses, but again, it didn't matter. I started to think about how I was exactly the same as all the other people in this building. I was fucking opioid dependant again no matter how hard I tried to fight it.        
       
20 minutes later and I was back on the street, charging my phone with a vape battery which acted as a USB charger. Waiting for a call. Finally the phone rang and I was told that a very upscale shelter was willing to house me.       
        
I waited 2 more hours and a cab pulled up. I don't know how much I should describe the cab ride. The driver was very clearly drunk/high, the woman in the front passenger seat was absolutely terrifying, and nothing was right. They both had a single gold tooth, and skin color wasn't a factor in this situation. White, black, etc, these people were scary. I was put in a cab with a female domestic violence victim, and the protocol states that a male and female can't be in the same car, even if the male was a domestic violence victim as well. I tried to open the door as nothing was right, not the address, not anything. The cab driver and passenger turned around and told me ""close that fucking door or I'll get out and close it for you."" They had complete control as they knew we didn't have a choice. followed is probably the scariest 2 hour drive of my entire life, and about halfway though while at a red light a small pipe was pulled out and lit. I couldn't tell if it was crack or something else, but at this point I had no other way of getting to the shelter.        
       
I closed my eyes and eventually we arrived.          
       
I guess I'll finish this story another day.

Peroneus brevis tendon repair w/calcaneal osteotomy. I’m a little anxious about the pain level after the nerve block wears off and just the pain level in general. I had micro fracture surgery on my big toe a couple years ago and was given Percocet 10s and tramadol ( I couldn’t stand the side effects of tramadol). The pain of a surgery just in my toe was literally 10/10, sobbing, worst thing I’ve ever felt when the block wore off despite starting the meds before it wore off. In the surgery packet I was given, it says they prescribe Norco for the pain. Doesn’t say what strength. I’ve been taking Tylenol 3s and Norco 5mg I got my parents to give me for the pain in the meantime (both have had recentish surgery and are upper middle aged). I’m visiting them tomorrow and plan to try and re up my supply of whatever they have and don’t want. They don’t know the extent of my pill usage. Anyways, I am concerned because while the Norco definitely feels nice if I take 3-4 with some Benadryl, I’m not sure if it will even touch the pain of what is essentially having part of my heel bone sawed off and reattached with pins.  If Percocet 10s couldn’t help me before with no tolerance I definitely feel like I’m in for a shitty ride. And I don’t know how to ask about it without sounding drug seeking. I refuse to take tramadol. I still have the pills from my other sugery (not sure why since I will never take them and I’m on an SSRI and seratomin syndrome freaks me out a bit). I know I should stop taking any opiates until my surgery to lower my tolerance but that’s easier said than done. Any advice? Sorry for the wall of text, on mobile. ",1533973513.0

A low dose, so 5mg with whatever it is for acetaminophen (200mg? I forget off the top of my head but yeah just standard vicodin).
I've never done any opiates before. Vicodin was taken off the market in my home country, and when I had my wisdom teeth out the doctor was cruel and only prescribed me Tylenol #2.
Because I have some extra, I want to try an opiate high. I've done lots of research and know how much to take, the risks, and so on. I do want this experience, and think I have enough restraint that I wouldn't keep using and start going out to buy it. I do not drink anymore, nor do I do any drugs. Maybe I shouldn't say this, but, I'm in Alcoholics Anonymous and pretty grounded in my sobriety. But because I'm in the program, I think I would have lots of support to fight those temptations if I did vicodin once and wanted to keep doing it.
Anyways, what I haven't been able to find is if I should hold off a while after taking the prescribed dose for pain before I take a higher dose recreationally. Most of the time I've only taken one 5mg a day. Sometimes I've taken it twice in a day, but never more, and it's not every day. I'm pretty naive to medication, so I have no idea if that little would mean any tolerance or build up in my body that would require me to abstain for a while (and for how long) before I could take any recreationally for a high.

Little did I know she had been covering emotions for 30 years. She suffered everyday, from the moment she woke up to the time she fell asleep. 

Previous marriages to abusive husbands let to her drug usage. A mental breakdown in the 80's sent her over the edge. Drinking liquor, popping pills, doing cocaine, and driving under the influence.

She was an emotional wreck.

She started deteriorating 4 years ago. It began with hallucinations. She took more and more pills to cover it. 

She would scream when she couldn't find her pills. Screaming at small things. Crying constantly.

She eventually was taken off Percocet and Ativan cold turkey. It was hell for her.

3 years ago, a horrible family accident happened, and that led to another breakdown. That led to depersonalization. She had no fix, and she literally lost her mind.

The worst part is that she realized she was losing it. That led to her getting more and more afraid of the future...maybe even the next day.

Fast forward to now. She has late stage dementia. It wreaks havoc on us, and that led to me drinking and doing pills.

It feels like a never ending battle. I'm afraid it'll continue generation to generation.

I had been prescribed it at 16mg a day from January to early July but due to relapsing from mid July until now my doctor discharged me. I haven't taken any subuxone in roughly 3 weeks so I can use it for a short detox.

I have 10mg of zubsolv left. I have two timelines I've been thinking of,that I would start tomorrow.

Option 1, which I think is my best option; is to stick through withdrawels for the initial 16-24 hours. Since withdrawels are weakest for the first 12 hours I shouldn't be in too much misery. I also want to choose this route because I can detox at a dose of 5.5 mg day 1. 3 mg day 2. And 1.5 mg day three. On this schedule I should be on late day 4 or early day 5 when I have no more subuxone. Pretty much getting me through the entirety of withdrawels.

Option 2 is to start subuxone immediately when I go into withdrawels. With this plan I would take 4 mg day 1, 2.5 mg day two, 2 mg day 3, and 1.5mg day 4.

It's pure white and doesn't have a smell. It's a lot stronger than most dope I've gotten around here. I believe it is either fent, a fent analogue, or possibly another RC (O-DSMT maybe? Never seen or had it). I'd really like to know what it is I'm buying but the plug either doesn't know or won't tell me (probably doesn't know). Is there a way to test the stuff and determine exactly what it is besides sending a sample to EC? If I purchased one of those Rapid Response strips that you dip in the dope that's mixed with water, and the dope I have is a fent analogue or another RC, would it test negative, test positive for fent, or is there a type that tests for different analogues and/or RC's? The dope is definitely different than the #4 I usually get around here. It's stronger and it puts me to sleep very easily. There's not as much euphoria as there is with the different kinds of #4 in my area. Any ideas on how to test my stuff and figure out exactly what it is would be greatly appreciated. ",1533943103.0

Dreezy chased her girlfriend off for being paranoid and jealous before she moved on to the next fling. I texted Danielle even though she was with another guy, and I complained about my heartache to Dreezy. Dreezy asked me if I thought she liked to hear about Danielle.

Dreezy would finally fall asleep at around 4 a.m. Sometimes earlier, but when she was out she could not be woken up. Slapping her didn’t work. Screaming was useless. We never tried pouring cold water, but it seemed doubtful that it would make any difference. It was a problem, because people wanted to buy 24/7. Most nights before she fell asleep she would send me and whoever was around with money for cigarettes, scratch tickets, grape red vines, fun dip, sour patch explodes, donuts and apple fritters, which were her favorite. She filled the grape licorice with the sugar from the fun dip and handed them out like the loaded syringes she handed out earlier in the day. Then she would pass out and wake up in the morning raging and throwing things.

She gave me five balloons of heroin one morning and sent me to sell them downtown, but before I took off with my bag and a long board Dreezy pulled out a huge bottle of random pills, from which I took three. I had not slept or eaten in days, and she sent me off 10 minutes later with a sweaty peck on the cheek and aggravated by how badly I was slurring my words.

At a store I packed bottles of cologne into my black book bag and some fabric grocery bags I had, even though I could see stout men with earpieces watching me through the glass doors. It was the fourth time I had been there to rob the place of cologne in two weeks, and it was obvious that the men were part of a sting operation set up to stop me. I kept going anyway and juggled the five heroin balloons in my mouth with my tongue on the way out. As soon as the door opened, a voice screamed,

“STOP RIGHT THERE!!!!”

I bolted down the street after a woman working for the store scratched my neck, and I punched her. She chased me and screamed for someone to stop me. A man with long hair grabbed my backpack, and three yellow balloons fell out of my mouth and onto the sidewalk. I broke free and skated to some festival at the park by the river. There were cops looking for me, so I took off my hat and jacket, hid the skateboard under a bridge and walked around talking to strangers. Cop cars drove by every 30 seconds looking for someone but never stopped me.

Later I did the two balloons I had in my mouth, and after a few hours I went to see if the other balloons were still on the ground. They were, and I sold one and did the rest of them under a bridge as night fell, because I wasn’t going back to the hotel on Mcloughlin. I told Dreezy that I messed it all up when she called, and she cried,

“Come back. I don’t care. It doesn’t matter to me. I want you back here. You are too important to me.”",1533942947.0

I knew my plug would be about 40 so we knew we had to wait.  That makes all the difference between two crane necking, sweaty fidgeting dudes looking shady squirming in a parked car in the heat. Instead of looking like a non criminal.  This plugs product is worth the wait, plus he said he was in a jam money wise. Hes always been solid and will front so, i decided to wait even being sick.


Instead of looking like the rest of the usual junkies who sit in their car in the park, I try to blend in with the civilians.  Sucks being sick but it's just so obviously shady to just sit there. Oh you're here to enjoy nature wearing long sleeves and jeans on this 100 degree day are you? I see.


So I made my friend throw the football around with me.I always keep one in my trunk. As suspected, a cop creeped along the bend within no time.  I alert my friend. Saying "" yo, cop car coming behind you, don't turn and stare. Just keep playing catch"". 

""What, 5-0?""
 Precedes to crane neck, stare. I had just caught the ball when I was saying the alert.  Of course I go ahead and throw the ball just when he crane necks, the ball hits him dead square on the side of the head, bounces back toward the cop now passing to his side, nearly goes in the open window, hits just below the door.

Dumbass. I started laughing. The cops obviously stopped. They were laughing. My star seeing friend comes to enough to apologize to the officer and grab the ball.  They start driving on their way. The cop passes me and casually says "" you got a real jerry rice on your hands eh"" 

It took me a little bit to realize what he said but it made my day. When I did, I waved at their back window and continued playing catch til my drugs came.

I always try to hedge my bets in case someone doesn't come through or postpones plans to meet up. Like how my main sub connect Danika postponed like three times and only on the third time did she say ""I gotta pick up my script on Monday"" which was an additional four days. So even when I was expecting to pick up from Danika, I contacted Tim on that Friday.


At that time I had a four day supply of subs and although I was pretty sure I'd see Danika on Monday, I wanted to have more peace of mind than that. So I contact Tim, he explains that he needs to borrow $20 and that he'd give me two zubs on Monday. I was willing but still asked the questions, ""what if something unforeseen happens on Monday?"" He assured me that it would be find and gave me some line of reasoning that I presently can't remember. 



On Monday I check in with Tim to see if he got his script and to set a time to meet him. He responds, ""About to go to pharmacy now and find out."" Of course I think, wtf does he mean by ""*find out*""?! 


Texts like that help me maintain my skepticism as well as the following: 


Tim stated, ""Give me like 25 min you may not even have to travel I might dro pit off to you"" then he said ""I'll let you know, stand by for an update.""


Ding ding ding - a minor alarm bell goes off in my head when Tim offers to graciously drop off the subs he owes me. I'm more than happy to meet him at work to pick it up if he was working that day, then again once he's home I guess he can't step out to hand me a sub because his wife would suspect something. Bottom line, it's just like a bad omen when Tim offers to drive over - especially in addition to to the other two or three texts that suddenly indicate a certain level of uncertaintly. 


&nbsp;

Tim goes on to explain, ""So 3 different pharmacies are fighting for me to be their customer consistently every Monday."" He continues, ""So this one pharmacy put in a special order for me that's not even there yet??!! Hahahahhaha every Monday I get 21 qty.""


At this point I'm still at a loss as to precisely how this affects me. I just want to know, am I getting anything or not? At this point I'm worried he'll drive over to me a drop off colonidine for fuck sake lol


Tim continues to explain, ""To make a long story short, I paid the $45 they gave me 3 only until tomorrow or the next day Sloan it was a mix up that will never happen again."" He goes on, ""**I'm going to drop one off to you now**.""


There we go, that's all I really cared about. 

&nbsp;

Not getting the second one only bothers me if I don't see Danika that evening. Which for the record, I did see Danika that evening. Then later in the week she hit me up again and promised to hold a few until l pay day and she actually did! So I'm good, I'm sitting on a 40 day supply but I'm still going to remind Tim about that one zub because it's the principle. Also, a single sub or zub equates to four days of dosages. I might not miss it now, but that single one can make a difference down the road. Especially if I'm tapered down weeks from now that single can equate to more than four days.

&nbsp;

Anywho, I'm just curious how $45 equates to Tim getting three zubs. My best theory is that he actually got more than three at $45 but didn't want me be on his ass bugging him for the second one he owed me since he normally takes 4 zubs every day. I wouldn't hold that against him, especially in my current position and because I would have done similar. Specifically, if I had two subs and Tim texted me because he had none I would say I only have one instead of two. I don't want to be begged to loan one out nor do I want to be presented with promises like ""I'll be getting my script in two days"" because I don't like when unforeseen shit happens. Hell, I foresee such things so it's not really unforeseen. 


&nbsp;


Excuses never resolved my supply issues and my experiences with Cliff have taught me to plan and prepare so that I'm not affected by such whims. 

A couple of days ago I called him, he said ""I'm with a customer I'll call you back."" I wait an hour or two and then I text him. Speaking of excuses, I hit up Tim two days ago and he's like ""I thougth you were gonna hit me up in the early afternoon"" and some shit about me having hit him up ""at the last minute."" I've almost only only ever visited Tim at work in the afternoon when I was getting dope in the past. Many other times it was established that he worked until 9PM, so that was my plan - to see him before 9. Well, he explains he got a busy schedule... gotta go to NA after work and then something about being off work at 7PM. Maybe it's true, maybe he's not working alone so there's a second worker there until 9pm but it's excuses instead of fulfillment of debt.


He did offer to meet me at some point but I wasn't going to be home for hours and was going to be seeing a movie that night with Cliff. Which by the way, the movie went well.. he didn't offer me any dope, apologized for doing dope in front of me as it which I said ""I'm happy as long as you're not offering, do you."" Oh and Cliff did do dope during the movie twice and did ultimately nod out a couple of times lol

Back to Tim.....

He also went on to state that he's not trying to avoid me, apologized for making me wait so long. Appeared to try to make arrangements to meet me but since I was going out to see a movie ti wasn't happening.


&nbsp;


The next day (yesterday) I text Tim while I'm at work to see whats up. First he explains that he's at a further away store working in the neighboring state.. so there goes my chances of meeting him at work via bike. Then he also explains ""but I wrecked my car last night and I from the whip lash my head is killing me"", ""I get out at 9pm tonight and should be back in town by 9:30 but I have to see some type of doctor."" Finally, ""I don't feel good my brain hurts like my head it's weird and I'm worried.""


I mean if it's all true, I can't put the screws to him and be a dick. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt since I have no choice, since I care about my friend Tim if it's true and because I still have more than 40 days of subs on hand so I'm not going to lose any sleep or get sick anytime soon.


&nbsp;

**Before signing off I did wish him luck, asked some questions so that I could advise him on concussions. Basically, if you got one take care of it or you could be dead like Willie Mays.** 



&nbsp;

**Addendum:**


Aside from the conclusion of the business with Tim, until I get to see him let's revisit movie night with Cliff. He pulled out four bundles in front of me, and did a line or two before the movie which I didn't mind and fully expected. It did not make me uncomfortable, I wasn't tempted at all and had no cravings. Like I said, he was apologetic and I said ""do you."" Maybe it was my 2mg dose of subs that day... maybe it was the knowledge that the sub would block the effects of H or the fact that I just don't want to reset a good streak. Maybe he didn't offer me dope because just consuming it in front of me would provide sufficient temptation or maybe he just realized I'm committed to staying the course.


&nbsp;

We'll see. I still suspect this movie night was partially to get his foot in the door - a hope that I'd hang out with him more again so that he could suck me in but that could just be paranoia. Even if I really wanted to do dope, I wouldn't do it with or in front of Cliff. The way I see it, once I do one line of dope with Cliff, I can't claim ""I'm trying to maintain my clean streak"", then if I order dope with him it'll just de-generate into a dumb financial entanglement again.



Hell, two of my motivations for not doing dope are not wanting to be like Cliff and not wanting to do business with Derrick.

I mostly smoke up at my dealer's place, once or twice a week. I smoke a couple of baggies (0.7 - 1 points for a fiver, excellent) and then take the next to my home. When I do this, I initially intend to stretch them out, so I can run errands I've been avoiding or wake up, smoke up, then clean up the house (in Spain the most consumed heroin preparation contains cocaine base [not the paste, just base powder], so you're smoking them at the same time; it is extremely motivating, and some places sell c base and h separately to mix at a leisurely ratio).

But the thing is, I often start smoking, and I see I have a relative many of them left. So I smoke another, then another...
The last time I binged by myself, I was up all night, smoking half a gram of powder until I was smacked out and nodding off hard. This situation is not exactly the best, but it is almost always inevitable. Until I remember I had hash, which I smoked.

Suddenly I'm feeling a hard synergy between the highs, and a tad overwhelmed by the intensity of the hash high. Now I don't feel like smoking more h for the time being (or at least my desire to smoke more is considerably lower than my desire to not touch the rest of the gear and remain satisfied in my [humble] amounts).

Sorry if I rambled too much, as I'm still enjoying the fruits of that sweet combination. This takes the paranoia out of weed, and it takes the compulsion out of dope, it's the best of both worlds! I think weed/hash/etc. lowers my compulsivity, because if I get a nice THC high, it will make me feel closure for the previous h high.

Whilst this process is whirring away, I take 1 OC 40mg out of my kinder surprise egg and put it in my mouth to remove the lustrous yellow coating and get crushing! 

I sit to enjoy my coffee ☺️

I repeat this process, sometime without coffee otherwise I would probably take off and hover somewhere down the road, about 5 times a day.

I could have died and left my family in shambles. That is what gets me: what it would have done to my fam. Thankfully Im good. 

I crashed my car in April after blacking out on 3 bars. I was on my way back from copping from my blue connect. I could not even tell you how I crashed, but I did, and next thing I know Im talking to a cop. And I guess the adrenaline kept me composed because the cop didnt even ask about drugs/alcohol (maybe he did and I dont remember). Totaled my car but no DUI and my insurance was good so I got another car. To this day I have no idea what I copped from my guy (he doesnt remember) and what I did with it.

In the ether of his room, we went back in time to when punk turned into grunge. He was the same kid who had run away from home at 14 in black combat boots and the denim jacket with spikes and sleeves cut off. Even though he was 33 now, he saw himself the way he was in 1991. All that he could see he stole. Cody filled up his garage-like room with useless electronics and other things he scavenged from doorsteps around the city. He squawked every word he spoke and had purple track marks that ran up and down his arms and neck like the stitched seems of a stuffed drawstring doll. His wood-glued Mohawk fit perfectly with the chain from his septum to his earlobe, and pinprick pupils revealed his ravaged soul. Preoccupation with heroin eclipsed everything else. He didn’t seem to notice his teeth were gone or that the last 15 years had passed. I was 19, and I wanted to be just like him.

We sniffled. We yawned. We ached until we fixed up. Then we bombed down hills at night on our skateboards. The shiny hood ornaments of vandalized cars jangled on the chains hanging from our waists. We howled and barked like dogs at the people walking by and tore through traffic on wet streets in the fog. Falling meant dying, and we pushed it harder every chance we got. We hung off the back bumpers of trucks heading up the hills like skiers on a lift and ripped back down the pavement.

Sometimes we sat on on a bench at midnight so he could play guitar and let his voice echo in the empty dark between buildings. Zombie crack heads laughed at his singing and the sight of us. We were invincible and intimidating as Vikings all night long but when the sun came up, we came down. Then, our backs hurt and we rode the ferry to work, where we groaned through painful labor regretting every moment of the night before. In the evening, we rode back to the city with runny noses. We got our fix and did it all over again.

So phone thief is on 120mg methadone a day, so i crush up half a subutex, gave it to old mate and told him to swap that for my phone. He ended up going to hospital because he thought he was having a heart attack and still denied taking my phone ahahaha.

My stepfather was an addict for 5 years, he went to prison for about 2 years for robbing a pharmacy for Vicodin and Oxy but when he came out, he was ready to take on life and was excited to see all his kids and was just thankful he was given another opportunity in life. 

Fast forward 2 months later and my mother breaks the news to me and my 3 other siblings that he OD’d alone in his apartment room on heroin. He never showed up for work which was unlike him so his boss went to check on him the next day and found him blue and stiff.

I was the only one that didn’t cry, he abused me when I was way younger so I had a resentment towards him, I never wished death upon him though. 

Everyone thought it was so strange I didn’t react to the news, not even at his funeral , I just kind of acknowledged it and comforted my siblings. 
I always pushed it to the back of my head and never thought about it but lately I’ve been thinking about him because my addiction is close to rock bottom and I literally imagined him dead and almost started crying and got weird and emotional. 

He was fresh out so his tolerance was non exsistent so it wasn’t intentional, he probably just drew up however much he use to do before he did time.

Did it hurt when he OD’d? Do you think he knew he was OD’ing or just nodded off and died?
It’s important for me to know this. Thank you so much , no assholes pls

RIP Ross Matthew Goben , you were an ass but you taught me how to be a good man, the man I am today. 

TLDR; stepdad fell out on heroin , is it common to know if you’re OD’ing or did he just die in peace/painlessly mid nod?",1533872592.0

Oi mate. I just read your response to my past in your thread. I'm doing my best to stay off the pills, so I'm drinking. Got to have a vice right? Better the lesser of two evils. 

I just felt I had to get this off my chest and tell my story. I never touched drugs until I dropped out of high school and fell in with a bad crew. Fast forward and the I have tried a bunch of drugs and my mother has become disabled with multiple sclerosis. My fathers health is failing because of a car accident when he was 18. I finally am clean and have my son with the women I intend to marry and shit falls apart. Next thing I know my son is taken from me at just 1 and a couple months. My ex claims I molested him and next thing I know I'm facing prison time. This is the point where I just break.

That night after interviewing with the police(bad idea I didn't have run ins growing up.) I get smashed and pop something like 10mg dillies with no real tolerence. From that point on I spend the last 2 years living at home just completly broken stealing my mom's dillies that she needs for pain. I eventually graduate to stealing her 10mg pills.

All this to basically say that the day I lost my son my heart broke. Something in me died that I won't ever get back. My life's coming together now, I escaped the false charges as the police violated my charter rights to having a lawyer present and I'm starting a career. I've got a wonderful women in my life who sees the boy behind the man who's been hurt.

Still struggling and  bidding my time to go for custody if my son. But man I never knew pain until I lost him... Now he's 3 and fuck I just ealized he's half way or so to 4.

Thanks for listening, Mate. I appreciate it.",1533871390.0

First time- I forgot a portable speaker in my car.... I’m a forgetful motherfucker so part of me thought my dumbass just lost it or forgot it somewhere

Second time- I got a new portable speaker.....and forgot it in my fucking car again (did I mention I’m a forgetful motherfucker)

Last night- my brother was staying at my house and here in Hawaii we take our shoes off before we enter a house and my brothers shoes were stolen off the front porch....

I’ve looked into booby traps and apparently they’re illegal in all states. I’ve been trying to think of a way to make an “art project” or something and just leaving it in my car that would severely fuck someone up if they sat on it or put their hand/knee on it while going through my car....

Calling the cops here is an option but 100% I know that they won’t be able to do shit about it. 
Even if I bought a camera to put outside...around these parts they could probably smile and wave at the camera and I know nothing would happen. 

Some of you I know are saying “just stop leaving stuff outside” which I have....after the second time my speaker was stolen and I realized for sure that I wasn’t just losing them. That they were stolen from my fucking car. But my brothers fucking shoes? Like what the fuck? We aren’t rich people living in a poor neighborhood. My car is an absolute shit box and not even all of the windows roll up on it. I live in a tiny little house in the back of a larger house. It’s not like we’re some flashy people living in the hood....

I’m kinda pissed and I kinda want someone to get fucked up for this. 

What could I do to deter people from going through my shit and stealing fucking SLIPPERS from my fucking porch? From now on I’ll just have to move everything inside. Even my fucking shoes apparently. But like I said, this is the third time and I feel like it’s the same people and I want to do something that will fuck them up and make them stop stealing my shit.

It was less than .1 worth, but after hitting it the only effects (aside from a very small rush) were a slightly elevated heart rate for about 10 minutes, some pretty bad unsteadiness and uncoordination (walking and fine motor) and some super fucking severe vision problems. Shakiness, blurriness, inability to focus. I was seriously mostly blind for about thirty minutes because I couldn't control where my eyes focused, if they focused.

That shit lasted about 30 minutes and I have some teeth grinding, and - honestly - I think my heart rate is actually slower than usual. *(I just took my pulse; my normal is 75-80; right now it was around 60... So, yeah, slower than normal heart rate, but from what I can tell its steady, not skipping beats or screwing around like it did the last times I made the dumbfuck choice to shoot crystal)*

This is the same shit I did earlier (11 pm last night) in a goofball with no ill effects, just the normal effects I was looking for. As a matter of fact, I actually did more in the goofball (maybe .2) than this morning shot. Two other people used the same batch with no ill effects.

<fast forward a bit>

Now, say a full hour post shot - only thing lasting is slower than normal heart rate (but no chest pain or tightness) and some shortness of breath.

So now all I can do is lay in bed 23 hours a day and have to have everything delivered to me. I watch YouTube videos and shoot heroin and eat xanax and smoke cigarettes all day.

Although the heroin helps the pain A LOT, I would have committed suicide a decade ago without it, I am still utterly miserable and am just waiting to die. I'm not suicidal, I'm just waiting to die.

I know this is a shitpost and you probably think I'm just a whining rich asshole, but until you've actually lived 24/7/365 with chronic pain for decades - every single second is torture without ever getting a break - only then will you realize how much more important health is than wealth.

I would do anything to go back to working a minimum wage job being dirt poor living with 2 roommates - if I could only have my HEALTH back.

I guess I'm rambling now, my point is just that health is that one most important thing in the world that you take for granted until it's gone, and not even being able to afford unlimited IV heroin can replace it.

And yes, before my parents died I was a broke homeless junkie. I would even rather go back to being a homeless junkie with my health still intact than a crippled chronic-pain-suffering junkie with a house.

Well, after I blew through the first vein, I started to get very serious about trying to be as strategic as possible to prolong each veins life.

So, once I found a vein, I went out of my way to follow it up as far as possible. This allowed me to now hit an area just over 6 inchs long, over and over, instead of a 1 inch area all those times. Dont get me wrong, I still rotated arms and veins, but I tried to elongate my hit areas as much as possible. 


Unfortunately, I'm a junkie and of course I started to hit the easiest vein way too often and now its probably bye-bye.  But, in the process I've been able to get what I think are some pretty long tracks? The one in this picture is almost the exact length as my galaxy s8 plus. So, if I had to guess, I'd say its roughly about 6 and a half inches long. 

What's your longest mark? I'm curious to find out if me thinking that's a long mark is stupid and it ends up being pretty common for people to e longer ones?

95tdaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/95tdaz/struggling_on_methadone/,2,https://redd.it/95tdaz,Randomthrowawa111,Struggling on methadone,"So I’ve been in methadone maintenance for a year, I started at 30mg and went down every so often then fucked up went down too fast and restarted back at 30 so it’s been a journey. Once I got settled at a system of lowering 1mg per week or 2, I’m now at 4mg and my doc has me going down 1 time per month now which I’m fine with id rather take longer and feel less than go faster. I accept this is a process.
Problem is on this whole system I never felt any discomfort I felt pretty great only a few times did I feel weird and have to take next dose slightly earlier the next day than I normally would. I’ve got all my takehomes since I’ve been clean the whole time but now that I’ve hit 4mg from 5mg I’m really starting to feel withdrawal out of nowhere.
Last week I felt fine and normal no agitation, no sleeping problems, no muscle aches, and yet now 6 days after being on 4mg I’m feeling like shit - barely sleeping, living on 3-5 hours sleep per night , wake up with my one arm feeling weird and skin crawly, and can’t get back to bed after that, and generallly restless.
I don’t know what I should do, stick it out and try to hope I stabilize on this or what? I’ve asked my doc what happens when I go from 1mg-0 and he let me know he will be able to prescribe me sleeping pills and things like that to help if I feel any withdrawal, do you think he’d prescribe it to me now while I’m still on the program?
I’m really proud of how far I’ve come but it feels so hopeless now that I realize I haven’t even gone through with the hardest part as I believed I had done it already by forcing myself to stabilize on 30mg rather than go higher when I just got into the program, but that was so long ago I don’t even remember what that was like I’m imagining it wasn’t as bad as these withdrawals.
What helps you with withdrawal ? Either to keep your mind busy or to avoid feeling restless and irritated? 
I don’t want to use anymore I’ve been clean so long and I’d like to keep it that way but I’m realizing I’m really lacking any coping methods because of how long it’s been since I’ve withdrawaled from anything so it has caught me off guard.
TLDR- if u have any advice or stories related to tapering off methadone at a slow pace / near the end of the taper and how it felt, how you coped, what more to expect, or anything to do with it, id love to hear it!",1533789339.0

There was no one to watch my back while I slept with Rufus locked up. I was running a real risk of waking up stripped of everything but my underwear. I’d seen it happen to nodding junkies before. The package in my bag would be a shame to lose. Karma though. If anyone stole it they would probably overdose. The stuff was too good. It was hitting me hard, and before I fell asleep, I thought on the first time I met my redheaded friend, Rufus.

The blind guy who plays the melodica on the corner by Safeway every afternoon told me where I’d find him that day in late October. Sure enough. There he was, just like the blind street musician said, standing with one foot on the curb another halfway out into the deadly traffic. His shirt was off. He was sweating and screaming into what I assumed was a phone, but upon closer inspection proved to be a large and tattered blue shoe. The closer I got, the quieter he spoke.

I wondered what kind of conversations people had on raggedy blue shoes and tried my best to hear what he was talking about or who he was talking to through the woosh of passing traffic. Who was this guy anyway? What was wrong with him? Mental illness ran rampant in the city. I was proof of that as much as he was. The content of his speech moved into strings of unintelligible grunting and desperate muttering. I think he said the name Thomas a few times. But that didn’t make sense. There couldn’t be anyone named Thomas on the other end of that shoe. That’s not how shoes work.

It didn’t matter to me, though. I came to score, so I caught his eye with a wave of the hand. He looked up and excused himself from the conversation on the shoe.

“What?”

“Are you Rufus?”

“Who wants to know?”

“Me. I got like 50 bucks. Looking for some tar.”

“What do you mean like 50 bucks? How many bucks is that?”

“I got 51, but I wanna get some smokes.”

“Well. That puts you at 45 at least.”

“K, then. I got 45 bucks.”

“My boy does 3 for 45. He does 4 for 50. Course you’re gonna have to give me one for getting it for ya.” This was a typical street junkie’s line when copping dope for a stranger. I know because it was the kind of thing I’d said myself to different customers over the years. I was new to town. There wasn’t much I could do about it, so I decided to forfeit the Marlboros and make due with whatever snipes I could find for the night.

“Let’s get four.”

“You got 50 on it?”

I nodded.

“Let’s go.”

We walked down the hill. Cold air pushed through the street between the concrete walls of apartment buildings like a narrow valley of rock on a mountain. It was the first time we made that descent, and we would make it many more, every time with excitement. Along the way, Rufus dug in every trashcan we came to. He would pull out sloppy packages of checkered paper and pour slimy chunks of whatever it had once been onto the pavement and pick through it. Sometimes it was just a thin gruel. Other times, it was easier to identify, but it was always soggy and stinky. I had been on the streets plenty myself and even ate out of trashcans here and there, but only when there were other circumstances in play. For example, I watched a family of tourists throw half of a pizza into a can while it was still in the box once in another town. I snagged it up and ate it. No problem, but the things Rufus was pulling up out of these cans were no good. He wasn’t eating anything anyway. It seemed to be some sort of involuntary tick caused by too many years on the streets and too many drugs. If he saw trash, he had to dig in it. That’s just the way he was.

We got closer to where he was taking me. People exited the subway stations in droves. An fat faced Asian madame jaywalked. Her girls followed in fishnet and fake fur: one, two, three like ducklings after their mother. Dope boys juggled multicolored balloons in their mouths on the busy corner to junkies like us as we walked by. We lurked like skeletons of ragged bones wearing the foul rags of drug addiction stained in soot and grease and blood. Finally, Rufus addressed one leaning against a telephone post and reading a magazine. This was his guy.

There was a short exchange. I didn’t hear what they said, but the dope boy’s eyes darted back over Rufus’s shoulder to me and back again. They moved towards an alley. I followed, and Rufus reached his hand back behind him and held it out. I put the money in it. His guy spat one, two, three, four of the latex packages into his palm, rolled them to get some of the spit off and handed them to Rufus, who handed the money over. We walked one direction. His guy walked the other.

Rufus took me back to where he was squatting at the time. It was utility storage space under the concrete stoop of an abandoned house several miles from where we scored. It was getting dark, but I could still see well enough to fix. We melted brown morsels into tiny puddles of coffee colored magic and rolled up our sleeves. Blood flowed out, mixed and pushed back in. We itched. We scratched.

The place had vibes. There was a milk crate which he sat on. I sat on a shopping cart which had been flipped on it side. The walls seemed to be covered in scratches like a prison cell where the days had been counted. In the corner was a blackened blanket and tarpaulin folded up like a pillow in the dust. It got darker. Rufus lit a candle. We took turns closing our eyes and trying to put our foreheads on the ground. Between bouts of blissful sleep we talked.

“What’s your name?” Rufus asked.

“Clyde.”

“Hmmm… I don’t like it.”

“You don’t like it?” No one had ever said that before.

“Nah. We’ll work on it. I’ll get you a better one soon.”

“Oh.” I didn’t understand.

“How’d you get into all of this?”

“What? Living outside? Heroin?”

“Yeah. All of it?”

“Life. I guess.”

“It’ll do that.”

“Yeah. It will. Ya know? I had trouble as a kid. Finally got it together by the time I was 18 for a few years. I managed a call center in Nevada where I got sober. Everyday, I went to work to pay my rent and bills. The next month, I paid all the money I’d made since for rent and food and all that again. The next month, same thing. It got old. You know. My car would be on E. I’d fill it. It’d be on E in less than a week again. I washed my clothes. They got dirty. I washed them again. They got dirty. And on and on into infinity. It was too much for me. I couldn’t handle it. Eventually, I got a grease spot on my shirt and walked away from it all.”

“Walked away, huh?”

“Well, let it go. I quit bathing or washing or working or paying rent. I just started using again and let myself and the place go.”

“So, a grease spot on your shirt broke you? That’s why you’re here living like this?”

“I never thought about it like that, but yeah.”

“No lady broke your heart or anything like that?”

“I was engaged once.”

“Mmhmm… What was that like?”

“She was special.”

“What kind of special?”

“Special, you know, like she liked to have sex with all my friends when I was at work.”

“Oh yeah. A real sweet heart. I know the kind, my friend.”

“Do you?”

“Sure do.”

“Tell me about it.”

“Same sorta thing. Ain’t nothing to tell really. I was a promising med student. We got married. She slept with my father. End of story.” It would be years before he told me about their daughter and how she’d died of leukemia. “What can you do? No good in crying, so I threw myself full on into my work and made being a doctor my life’s work. I was an oncologist.”

“Studied cancer?”

“Very good. Most people don’t know that. I did. Eventually, though, I couldn’t hide from the gaping hollow inside of me. The great emptiness became too much. I started smoking and buying scratch tickets and tearing the tags off mattresses. One time I even dumped a load of trash under one of those signs that tells you there’s a huge fine for doing so. I started small, but I realized that I loved doing bad things. Eventually, I lost my license to practice when they found out I was addicted and writing my own prescriptions.”

“Man. That sucks.”

“Sure did, but again, what was I gonna do? Cry? I don’t think so.  I was tired of it anyway.  You know everyday, stick your finger up someone's butt or hold their nuts in your hand.  Tell people they're going to die slowly and painfully.  Being a doctor isn't glamorous.”

“What’d you do?”

“I moved on to other things. Someone got me a gig giving eulogies and speaking at people’s funerals. Oddly enough, I was very good at it. People want to believe their deceased loved ones were the greatest thing that ever existed, even when they weren’t, so I just played it up. Said nice things.”

“Wow. That’s interesting.”

“It is, huh?”

“Yeah. What happened with that?”

“Well, you know, addiction is bad enough to stand between a man and anything and everything he could ever want for himself. Besides that, though, I had this bit where I’d take these white doves or pigeons and release them from a basket as I said something about the beloved deceased’s soul being free from the body of flesh like the birds from the basket. Now they could fly high, unhindered by life and its weight.”

“Yeah?”

“Well, one time, we were at this funeral on the side of the freeway. I released the birds. Two of them flew right into a semi going 80 miles per hour. Another one of the birds flew up into an oak tree there above the family and friends all dressed in black, and as soon as the other two got hit by the semi, the one in the tree was devoured by a cat.  We heard blood gurgling cries from it and wings flapping and even the crunch of its skull in the cats mouth. 
 Finally, it fell dead to the ground.  It was a ghastly sight. No one was happy. I didn’t want to do it anymore.”

“Shoot. Don’t blame ya.”

“No? I was a deer strangler after that.”

“What’s a deer strangler do?”

“Strangle deer.”

“Makes sense.”

“It does, doesn’t it? Yeah. They’re overpopulated and a nuisance in certain parts of the north. A lot of neighborhoods have laws about discharging firearms or shooting live animals and that kind of thing. So, they pay someone to trap ‘em and strangle ‘em. It was good money.  A lot of free meat.  Left it too, though. Couldn’t handle it.” We talked until dawn. I gave him another balloon as the sun came up.

That was the first night we met. We were always together after that, always had each other’s back. He wasn’t there that night, though, under the theatre overhang next to the box office window with me. The sentimentality invoked by my memories faded. I drifted into a land of sleep and terror.

I had visions of evil in the dark and everything was on fire. The Faceless One would be the end of us. Rufus would die. It was made clear by the nightmare beings that visited me and the awful things they spoke to me as I slept. When I woke up, my arm was totally asleep. I was whimpering. The cops would be by soon to kick us and make us leave. Water trucks would blast firehose jets at the walls and sidewalk to wash away the night’s feces and urine after that.

I opened my eyes. A figure stood at my feet in a cloud of potent pot smoke like some fantastic apparition translated from some nether realm to that time and place before me. He spoke with a wobbly voice.

“Boom Boom? What ya crying for? You know that doesn't do any good.” It was Rufus.",1533786889.0
