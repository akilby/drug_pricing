9yoll4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9yoll4/goofballing/,6,https://redd.it/9yoll4,EitherSmoke,Goofballing.,"I saw a recent post where i guy mentioned goofballing and it got me curious. Have many of you on this sub tried goofballing? For those of you that don't know, goofballing is mixing heroin with methamphetamine. You don't need to shoot it for it to be a goofball, you can also snort or smoke the two substances at once.

You might be thinking, ""Why would someone want to do that?"" Well, there is a few reasons. 

First, mixing heroin with meth gets rid of that edgy/wired/possible paranoid feeling that meth can bring. It actually feels like a very relaxing meth high. 

Secondly, it is way more euphoric than taking either substance by itself. Thirdly, its better than speedballing (coke & heroin) because coke only lasts an hour or so, so you would need to redose the coke. Also, coke overpowers the heroin. 

It obviously isn't the safest combination so you should start out with small amounts of the two substances, especially because i think they both potentiate each other. 

I've only done a goofball one time. I mixed 50mg of ice and 50mg of heroin into one line and snorted it. The meth didn't over power the heroin and i felt both substances for a few hours before the heroin sort of wore off and i was left with a very relaxing meth high. 

I don't recommend this high, i just wanted to explain my experience with it incase some of you were curious about goofballing. 

How many of you have goofballed and enjoy it? ",1542687536.0

I have been hooked on Tramadol for about 3 years now, it started out with me getting a prescription because of pain after a surgery. But quickly turned in To buying illegally since its so abundantly available where i live.

It has varied wildly in dose, from first beeing on a steady 200mg the first year, To it getting up To over a gram per day a couple of months ago. I have not cramped ever. I just dont want To do it anymore.  It isnt fun having To take a pill a couple of Times a day just To live life normally and having energy To work and function like a regular human beeing. 

This is a complete secret i keep from my family and friends including my wife.  With the exception of a few buddies that have almost the exact same journey as i do. 

I have quit a couple of Times before. Tried it all, CT , tapering, benzos. And the WD symptoms are just too much for me. Especially since i have To act normal while shivering and cold sweating and not beeing able To lay down still bc of the RLS(which i am diagnosed with even before the drugs). 

Ive only managed To be a couple of Days without it before turning back bc of the pain and suffering. 

I gave it another shot a week ago and tapered off from a steady 400mg to 100mg in the last couple of days. Its now been 3 days since the last dose. 

And This time ive gotten my hands on a couple of oxy 80s, ive taken minimal doses(5-15mg orally) two Times today, and it actually works! The euforia isnt there or the energy but i dont feel like dying, and i dont have those wierd brain flashes.

Now i know oxys are a much stronger drug, and i dont plan on taking these for recreational value, and have Maybe a weeks worth if i continue with this pace.

But am i really detoxing in this time ? Or am i just feeding the same need in a different way?  I wouldnt want To quit with the oxys in a couple of Days only To find out that i havent made any progress(Maybe i made it worse?) 

Can you detox from one opiate with the help of Another ? How much do you have To keep taking oxy To get physically dependent(in doses No more than 20mg, max 40mg in a day)? Wont my body crave opiates when i stop? ",1542674404.0

I have tried hydros and codeine w/acetaminophen on separate occasions, neither of which got me high at all (no opiate tolerance) and just made god awfully sick. Made my reasoning concrete as to why I avoid these things. (No more than 1000mg of ace at a time.)

Recently, I got ahold of some RP 5/325 percs. Took two yesterday, found somewhat of a high but still became very nauseous and sick. I still have 0 opiate tolerance. I do understand that RP's are regarded as bottom of the barrel pharmaceuticals. I have heard people say that only RP's 5/325's make them sick. 

What I wonder now is, is it the acetaminophen that is making me sick every time or am I just very prone to opiates? (even though the high was very subpar) 

I have thought about doing a CWE on these RP's, but I have held off on the chance that it is the opiate itself making me very nauseated. 

TL;DR: Everytime I have taken an opiate, it has contained tylenol and I cannot pinpoint whether it's the opiate or tylenol making me sick. 0 tolerance, 10mg of oxy and 650 mg of Acetaminophen, made me very sick.

Just picked up and me and my bf are sitting here discussing how much we think our dealer makes. Can't find anything with Google, I figured I'd ask somewhere that people may know from experience.

I don't know if I'm allowed to post prices or the place, if I can because I'm not sourcing, just curious, let me know and I can give more details. I live in a big Midwest City and buy dime bags, usually wrapped up in foil but we get stamp bags here too.

My dealer answers from 9am-10pm every day, so I don't think she has a regular job. I never meet her personally, she has 1-2 runners she must pay that also work all day. She's the biggest dealer in this part of town, always has other people waiting near us. I'm assuming cause I've met like 4 other dealers on this strip, but their shit isn't as good, less flexible hours/take a while, and always meet themselves. I know a lot of people who go to her, and I've gone every day for about 2 years.

Any estimates? I'm really clueless when it comes to this. I don't know if they buy the dope prepackaged or if they make the bags themselves, or how much they buy it for. I'm really curious how cheap it is for them and how much they must make to not work.

Edit: thanks for all the replies! I just wanted to say I'm not specifically asking about my dealer, there's obviously no way anyone could know, just using as an example. I'm also not looking for specific answers, I get that it varies greatly and there are many variables. Just asking for a range or very rough estimate, if anyone has experience.",1542657137.0

Whether it be Oxy, or even really high doses of Opana(120-200mg) daily, the routine has pretty much been 24 hours after last dose I would start to feel minor withdrawal and I would dose. Usually 1-2mg at first and if all was well, which it always was, I would jump right in. 

Over the past year I have started snorting ECP. The stuff I get is pretty potent and I have been going through 1.5 to 2 grams a day. It seemingly has crazy long legs because I have put myself into precipitated withdrawal 3 times in the past few months. The last time I waited 36 hours before a 2mg sub dose and it absolutely wrecked me. I assume the stuff I am getting is has some fentalogues in it with it being as potent as it is. I have also read that some forms of fent have very long half lives. 

With all of this in mind, I thought I was a veteran of the Suboxone game having been doing this dance for the past 8 years, but now I am at a loss. I go to the doctor today and they will write me for a month, but I am scared to death to take it. The last time I was 36 hours in and in decent withdrawal and it rocked my world.

I apply a 25 microgram patch every 3 days due to multiple surgeries gone. I don't know if it is because of the change in weather or what, but my patches having been falling off like crazy. I'm not due for a next refill until December 6th, and I held out as long as I could, but the second day of withdrawals broke me down. I finally applied my last patch today.

I was wondering if there were any tips on how to make them last longer, or if there are OTC meds that will lessen the withdrawals. I am prescribed clonazepam for withdrawals and have some Librium (not much) after a very long stay in the hospital where I was hooked up to a fentanyl pump.

Anyway, any help you all could provide would be great. I am so sorry if this question is inappropriate for this sub.

Thanks,

P.S.
Should I apply my patches some place other than my sholders.

I owed dude some serious debt so I went by last night to pay him everything back. I've always gotten along with him and his friends really well, for a cartel connected drug dealer, he's a really fucking good dude.

Basically spent 2 hrs at the trap having my DOC shoved in my face and didnt even flinch. Never even considered relapsing. Say what you want about ""subs arent clean"" but a huge part of why I didnt relapse is knowing 1) I literally cant get high without heroic amounts for at least 24 hrs off the subs and 2) I have a weekly drug test at the sub clinic and will lose my script if I fail it.

9ye4fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9ye4fa/so_you_want_a_script_guide_to_going_to_pain/,44,https://redd.it/9ye4fa,cozywarmedblanket,So you want a script? Guide to going to Pain Management and not acting like a junky,"First off, the days of getting big scripts for a fake back ache are gone.  Only proceed if you have an actual injury or pain.

An interesting fact is that most adults have some form of fluid sac degradation in their spine, so you may have damage that would show up on an MRI and not even know it.

1. **Dress nicely** \- not fake nicely, but like you dress like that every day.  Take a shower, shave, and wear clean pants/shorts and a button down/polo/solid color shirt.  Don't wear graphic tees or anything like that.  If you have trac marks, be sure to wear long sleeve.  Also cover up any tattoos you can.  Dont wear those double layered shirts I see people cover their arms with for court.  You know the ones - white on bottom and a tshirt over.
2. **Don't go in looking for a script** \- even if thats your goal.  Go in explaining that you have this pain and its been affecting your life/sleep/work.  Tell them you've tried to do the things you used to but cant anymore and **just want answers.**
3. **Accept that it'll take 3 or more appts before a script could even come up** \- the first appt will be all talk, then an MRI/imaging, and then an after discussion.
4. **Try everything they throw at you** \- If you want to try and short circuit some of the options you can say you've been trying physical therapy on youtube or whatever, but if they want you to go to PT, go.  When the doctor talks to you about trying a shot or whatnot, **listen and act hopeful that it'll help.**
5. **Pay with insurance, if you can** \- cash is always a bad sign.  If you dont have insurance, pay with a credit card.
6. **Wait at least a few months before trying to up your script, if not longer** \- you can get away with having a ""bad reaction"" maybe once, but if its your first script its a bad sign.  Also you only get so many changes before they cut you off.  One nice thing is most insurances wont pay for oxy ER anymore, so the PM will usually work with you on a med that your insurance covers - this is when you can use the ""morphine gets me feeling tingly and weird(histamine)"" and get opana or something else as its covered.  **Don't push your luck!**
7. **DONT go to the ER** \- people who are really in pain dont go to the ER all the time.  If you're in lots of pain and the clinic is closed, leave a voicemail or call the next day.  Also, it should go without saying, but **dont be stupid and try to get an injury to get a small script, it will not work.**
8. **Always go to the same pharmacy** \- accept that the first time going they will contact your doctor multiple times.  They may even want the chart.  Be patient and persistent.
9. **If a pharmacy says they are out of stock, ask for them to order it:** pharmacies bank  on the fact that people wont ask that.  Try to find a pharmacy that is a chain but not super busy.  Build a rapport with a pharmacist just like you are with your pain doctor. 
10. **Don't ask for early refills, ever.**  Also don't be the guy filling the script at 12:01AM or when they open.  Pick it up around lunch or so.
11. And, last but not least, be ready for drug testing - some places do it less than others, but have a plan for this always ready to go.  Ive never had a place actually do a pill count, but so ready over your pain contract and be ready for that too.

Hope this helps with the many questions I see all the time about getting meds at pain management.  If I forgot anything, let me know!

Bonus: here are some reasons why certain medications might cause you problems that warrant a change:

**Tramadol** has an SSRI effect which can cause depression, brain zaps, and other bad side effects.

**Morphine** is known for bad histamine reactions - pins and needles, itching, etc

**Some ER formulations** are known to cause upset stomach

When in doubt, google the drug and read all the known side effects and see which were most common.",1542607957.0

Oddly enough I have found that I now like the feel of Tram due to its energetic effects& duration. That fact is almost laughable to me because I can remember 20 years ago using Tram and thinking it was useless garbage with almost zero effects. Body chemistry and situations change I guess.
I am looking for something long acting that won't put me in total nod territory but will feel nice. Tram does that but I would like to alternate with either Oxy or Methadone. The lack of cross tolerance with Tram is a nice benefit.

I will maybe just try it with the Lorazepam first and wait till I pass my drug test. Its ok if I will be positive for benzos since I got a script for them. and since 10x2.5mg Lorazepam are like 25x10mg Diazepam I can do it with them too. And then I can enjoy some oxy which I have just done once. Since oxy isnt very common in my country. Maybe someone got some input for me. I tried staying off for 24 hours. And I did it. Stayed sober for more than 24 hours but then I just couldnt stand the diarrhea and chills. So if needed I can do it cold turkey too but it will be hard and I have to go to work too so I wont risk that. I just need to pass one drug test and then I can use for 1-2 month again and then I need to pass a test again. If I am correct opis stay for 4-6 days in your urine.

She‚Äôs done weaker opioids like tramadol and codeine.

I need to know how to talk to her and tell her that I am only willing to do this once and that she is not getting my connect‚Äôs number and nor am I ordering her any H off the dark web.

While I was there, my normal physician (who prescribed all the good stuff) moved out of state. So in the time I‚Äôve been back, I‚Äôve kind of been tossed around to different doctors in the practice with no one knowing quite what to do with me as they are all terrified of killing me with an OD or having the DEA on them. So it‚Äôs been a bit of a stressful ordeal trying to keep my medications straight with them. 

Anyway, today (yes on a Sunday.. weird), I got a message from one of the doctors that I‚Äôve seen there recently with the subject: ‚ÄúWe need to talk... OPIOIDS‚Äù
Ahhh! I‚Äôm freaking out. I truthfully can‚Äôt even get enough courage to actually open the message (I figure since it‚Äôs Sunday there isn‚Äôt shit I can do about anything he would potentially say until the office opens tomorrow anyway). I am so scared though. 

This is kind of a shit post so I apologize, but you guys are the only people that would understand. Not only am I going to be in a world of withdrawal hurt if they take my opioids away (which I am pretty sure that‚Äôs what this message is going to say...I‚Äôve got the feeling since seeing docs I don‚Äôt know well that they all want to say that but no one quite has the guts...), but I have actual legitimate conditions that are ridiculously painful, and a tolerance that is - thanks to being over prescribed from a time when I didn‚Äôt know any better - that of a small rhinoceros ü¶è. 

I am not even an ‚Äúaddict‚Äù if you go by the definition of doing it because if cravings and despite it having a negative effect on ones life. I don‚Äôt have the mental cravings (been thru withdrawal a number of times due to pharmacy screw ups over the years and... withdrawal itself is honestly the least of my worries... it‚Äôs the actual pain I experience when I don‚Äôt have decent doses... if I don‚Äôt have pain I don‚Äôt take meds and it‚Äôs not a big psychological deal). 

However, I am terrified. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do if they take my meds away. I will be completely nonfunctional, not able to get out of bed, and lose everything that I‚Äôve accomplished BECAUSE of opioids (well because of the pain relief from them). It‚Äôs exactly the opposite of most people‚Äôs issues but nonetheless it‚Äôs the same result. 

It‚Äôs dumb but I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna find the courage just to read the damn message and am here stressing myself out not even knowing what‚Äôs going on. Ugh.

Started with t3s, then to perks, then dillies and morphines, and finally moving to hydrocodone as its the one I like best. I can honestly attribute it to a lot of the successes i've had the past 5 years. Being able to take an edge off in a fast paced, critical thinking, extreme stress environment has proven to be extremely beneficial for myself.   


 I'l use sometimes a max of 60mg in a single work day ( sometimes 80-100mg when partying on weekends ), and then say the next day after a big mg day/night use only 40mg max. My doses are very, very sporadic and generally it's not because I NEED to take one ( can't get the thought of an oxy out of my head ), it's more or less because i'm bored or may have a stressful situation that needs enduring where taking an edge off has proven to have an advantage. I understand that when I run out of the pills I like, that other forms of harder opiates are completely off limits. Period. Never once have I thought about buying heroin, or fentanyl, or ANY other substance or pill where I don't know where it came from. If I can't find a true script of oxy's or dillies, where I can actually see the seller's script info on a bottle ( i've had the same scripts for years anyways ) I just refrain from using opiates period. Buying heroin, or harder opiates does not appeal to me in the least bit. I almost pass out when I get blood drawn, or see a needle. Very sorry to some, but heroin actually fucking disgusts me.   


 The longest and highest mg dose I have used opiates was 8 months straight, at 40mg-60mg a day with the odd 20mg only tossed in and higher doses on weekends. I know for some that's peanuts. I decided to cut cold turkey when non where readily available, and tried to keep my body and mind busy, and only craved them mentally for maybe 3 days after my final dose. The physical symptoms where normal, fair amount of cold/hot sweats especially at night time, random mood swings, and a deep sense of anxiety. It's weird, when I feel all of these symptoms I can fight through them, and I can keep reassuring myself it's just the drug and not me. That's what keeps me going. I know it will pass, and for all the situations it's helped me out in the past years, it has to come with a hand of bad. I have stopped cold turkey dozens of times over the years, and each time it almost gets a bit easier.   


Is this normal? Are their others like me? Thank you. ",1542566998.0

I was told by my doctor and some answers on the internet that bupe or subs will not test positive on a 6 panel test (oxy, amphetamine, cocaine, thc, pcp, and benzos) and that the test would need to look for specifically bupe. I was researching on the internet when i ran across this

""YES! Suboxone is comprised of two different drugs, buprenorphine and naloxone. Oxycodone tests look for a metabolite called Noroxymorphone. The problem is, one of the metabolites of Naloxone is Noroxymorphone as well. This is a little studied fact that users of Suboxone CAN show positive for Oxycodone as well. It appears that Noroxymorphone can be detected in the body after taking Naloxone for between 2-5 hours after absorption. Suboxone is taken sublingually, under the tongue, and Naloxone is poorly absorbed sublingually. The problem is that many Suboxone users are swallowing the mouth full of liquid (Suboxone, saliva) after the buprenorphine is absorbed. Since the Naloxone is not well absorbed under the tongue, it is absorbed after swallowing!! A friend of mine just tested positive for the Oxycodone metabolite Noroxymorphone and he has been taking only Suboxone. A solution to this problem may be to raise the cutoff level for Noroxymorphone in Oxycodone tests.""

Is this true? The only opiate on the test is oxy.",1542563554.0

In April I went into long term rehab and I got off heroin, methadone and benzos. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say these last few months I‚Äôve been the ideal NA ‚Äúcaptain recovery‚Äù sober soldier though. After my 4 months of in patient treatment when I came out I kinda relapsed on methadone for 2 months, then went back to benzos to get off the methadone, and I‚Äôve been using benzos on off since then. But it was on April 13th, a Friday, that I last used heroin. 

Anyway, I was dumb. I put myself in the position where I knew I would be in danger. I agreed to drive my friend to score some dope for a sleeve of my 10 1mg Xanax (Pfizer ones rare in South Africa) and some weed. He gets back to the car and I smell that vinegar, homie bought like 4g. He only smokes heroin while I used to shoot it, so when he asks if he can chase one quickly since he‚Äôs sick, for the long ride home, and I‚Äôm feeling strong and stupid on 2mg Xanax not giving a fuck about anything so I say for sure bro. 

I saw him split a shard, put a lump on some clean foil and trail it down and I was fucking hypnotized. Long story short, I ended up smoking with him then snorting some. At least I didn‚Äôt hop back on the needle I guess. How is it possible to feel so bad and sooooo good at the same time. After I dropped him he asked me if I wanted some and I said no. 

What a fuck up, this the longest I‚Äôve been clean in 11 years. I got my life back, I got a dope ass job, I‚Äôve actually got some meat on my bones, I‚Äôm invited to family functions again. And I‚Äôve got more money in my acc than I ever thought possible. 

I‚Äôm gonna chalk it up to a one time fuck-up and not beat myself up too much. I‚Äôm in such a crisis about telling my NA group so close to my 1 year. FUCK. 

But like fuck I feel good man, I‚Äôve been telling myself maybe I can just use it every now and then by snorting. Playing mental tug of war, but I know that can only go one way. 

Never get complacent you sober ones! After a length of time you think you‚Äôre strong enough to put yourself back into dangerous ‚Äúpeople, places, things‚Äù etc... avoid situations like these with people who still use like the plague..

so i drove about 45 minutes to meet up with my coworker friend, who has been addicted to H for some time and also sells it.

even though we‚Äôre mostly work friends, we‚Äôve hung out a few times outside of work and get along really well. so she generally cares about my safety and well being & wanted to show me how to properly smoke it and how much to do. 

i told her at first that i‚Äôd just watch her do it because i didn‚Äôt want to drive 45 minutes home, high on heroin for the first time. but she insisted that i try it right now and that i won‚Äôt get fucked up with a hit or two. so i took two hits of it off the foil and all was good. i really didn‚Äôt feel anything right away, but then she wanted a ride to get 10 dollar bills from a gas station. 5 mins after, i just felt the opiate euphoria just wash over me. it felt really nice but i wasn‚Äôt super high. i could still drive confidently for 45 minutes. 

when i got to my house, i was really excited to get even higher. so i smoked a little chunk (about the same size that her and i sorta shared) and felt decently higher. about five minutes after that i decided i really wanted to go the full length, so i smoked the other little piece that was even a bit smaller than original one. i also crushed up the tiny crumbs on the bottom into a nice little bump and railed that. 

after all of that, i was really high. my whole body was half numb and i almost felt weightless. i was trying to do stuff on my phone but i was nodding off so hard i couldn‚Äôt even keep my eyes open. after battling the nod for about 30 mins, i tried to fall asleep. 

and that‚Äôs where shit went bad. 

i thought that heroin, or just opiates in general, would make/help you fall asleep, but i could not fall asleep for the life of me. i just tossed and turned in my hazy high. for hours. somewhere in that time i had lost my high, and around 7am i started to get a headache. that‚Äôs when i decided i had enough and just took a ton of hits from my wax pen and drank a bit of water and passed out for about two hours. 

i woke up with a TERRIBLE migraine, i felt like i had no energy. i eventually got up from my pain to go to the bathroom, but getting up and moving made me start to get clammy and sweaty, and my stomach started to get really upset. i was feeling so hot and like i was going to vomit, i just went outside quick and bent over for five minutes. only dry heaving once. 

i then went to my bed and laid in agony. basically the same symptoms for hours until i managed to pass out from enough THC entering my body. the hour nap helped a bit and the symptoms slowly wore off. except for the pounding headache which i eventually solved with some ibuprofen. 

where did i go wrong?? is this just a normal heroin hangover? was my body already having withdrawal symptoms from one use? did i just take too much or was the usage too spanned out in time? what will help me feel better if i find myself in the same situation?

&#x200B;

Let me try my best to make a educated guess, I'll bring up a few things below.

We know from studies that of those RXed opiates maybe 1-2% will go on to develop addiction, we also know from a study done in Europe that when offered INFINITE FREE HEROIN addicts would initially consume much more but almost all eventually settled to around 2 grams per day in the long run.

&#x200B;

I do think casual opiate use for aches and pains would skyrocket, you know people popping some codeine or oxycodone for backaches or menstrual cramps etc. Many people right now take a horrifying amount of APAP or NSAIDS just to get through the day, I think they'd actually be better off on low dose opiates.

&#x200B;

I assume the lower levels of society would see a lot of opiate addiction, but it already does so its a wash pretty much.

&#x200B;

I think hard core addiction might actually decrease slightly. Legal or not society would still frown on IVing daily. I think there are people who for whatever reason will still be reckless and OD etc. Alcohol is legal and there are still people knowingly drinking til their liver screams and shrivels into a ball. I think the greatest threat to a return to prohibition is people wanting to ""do something"" to save this reckless population.

I‚Äôve been addicted for 4 years now hardcore daily use and the last 6 months I‚Äôve been going to one crew specifically because their shit is so strong, I went from two-three bags to a nod to just half a bag putting me to sleep and almost puking. The high lasts for hours and hours and I don‚Äôt wake up sick in the morning. The dope has an earthy smell with some powder a little bit of chunks and slightlyyyyy moister feeling than other ECP.




One day that crew has no work so I go to one of my many back up crews. The dope looks good and just like the same dope I‚Äôve been doing for years, I do 2-3 bags and feel barely anything, 7-8 bags.. same. I‚Äôm still having chills and don‚Äôt want to eat, can‚Äôt sleep.




Later down the road someone tells me they know the plug I get the good shit from and not only is it a LOT of fent, but now they‚Äôre using some kind of tranquilizers and shit mixed in - and it‚Äôs barely coming up as dope on a drug test...




So what I‚Äôm asking is... how the fuck is it possible to get clean these days when the dope people are getting isn‚Äôt even really dope but it‚Äôs a mix of like three different fentanyl analogues and tranquilizers and shit. The withdrawal is crazy and it‚Äôs not just 1-2 weeks of sickness and you‚Äôre fine anymore. If anyone else saw the thread a few days ago from the ‚Äúformer drug chemist‚Äù and his write up about most ECP being a shit ton of different fent analogues alone now - it makes so much sense to me.






TLDR- how the fuck do you get clean when ur dope is super fentanyl tranquilizers and regular dope doesn‚Äôt even touch it. Have you had this shit before? Wtf have you done? ",1542501114.0

So anyways, it‚Äôs not a huge mess but some crap I wanted to bring to the shed like my BB guns and paintball guns, stuff I just don‚Äôt need In a bedroom closet.

Found an old safe, I mean old, like at least 8 years old, it‚Äôs small, I got it from a yard sale and used to put my goods in there back when I was using regularly. 
Open it up and see a pill bottle, dump them out and orange hexagon pills come out. I knew exactly what they were, the old sublingual subs from a long ass time ago. Since it‚Äôs not in the original bottle, there is no what to tell the exact expiration date. I‚Äôd say at least 4 years or so? I got them fresh from someone who used to sell his script. I bought them on days he got his fill and that was like 6 or 7 years ago...I can‚Äôt think of the exact time frame but shortly after my last purchase he started getting the films. 
I estimate them to be 3-4 years expired bc if they were fresh say 7 years ago, meds usually are good for 3-4 years so yeah. I could be absolutely wrong. 
Anyways it was a nice surprise for sure but don‚Äôt know if I should keep them around to test out on a rainy day. I had a buddy who would get high off them. I‚Äôm not a daily user anymore but maybe a rainy boring day that I‚Äôm broke I can test them. Idk, I‚Äôve got 37 of them just chillin in a bottle. I put them back in the safe and put up. 
Anyone know how much it affects the quality or even if it does? I‚Äôve taken T3‚Äôs that we‚Äôre 20 years old from my parents house from my dads root canal back in 1995 and still felt like it was T3 and imo the potency was the same, if anything it may have went down a tiny tiny bit.

Full: About 3 years ago I started to get into using opiates (small amount like 5-10mgs of oxy once a week or so). About 2 year ago I started to do them daily in high doses, 3 10mg IR Opanas 4 10mg oxys, 2-3 10mg methadone, and an 8mg dilauded when I could get my hands on any of it and Ioved it. It always me made me feel invincible, but within this last year of 2017 I really slowed down and stopped about 6 months ago, except for the occasional 10-20mg oxy once in a blue moon. I'm in a bit of a delimma now, I rarely use anymore but I've been dealing with depression and anxiety my whole life. I've tried almost every medicine on the market for those illnesses but nothing seems to click. However when I take small amounts of opiates, say a 10mg hydro or a 5mg oxy, I always feel like I have a drive to get things accomplished. I've lost the interest in getting completely fucked up off these things, but I feel like they do have a therapeutic value to them in smaller doses. Does anyone else do this or feel this way?

I had read online somewhere of someone taking 3 75mg doses of methadone to get off H with no withdrawal. I was skeptical but out of options. I need to work but can't if I'm withdrawing. So I bought 150mg of methadone and used the last of my heroin.


Day one : I woke up in withdrawal only having used a small amount last night and had just enough left over to get me well enough to get into work. At about 1am I consumed my first 50mg dose of methadone and an hour later I was feeling pretty good. Like the feeling after you were high but not yet in withdrawal. Content. 


Day two: woke up in withdrawal? Felt sluggish had rsl and a runny nose. Oh no this isn't gonna work fuck. Trudged to work and consumed another 50mg methadone at 9am. Again felt great. 


Day three : woke up very tierd but atleast no withdrawal symptoms. Got into work and decided to take 30mg and leave 20 just incase. Again felt great. 


Day 4:woke up no withdrawl Again very tierd though. Decided not to take methadone felt pretty good throughout the day just more tierd than usual. 


Day 5 : tierd Again but no withdrawl feel pretty good through the day. 

That's where I'm at. Late in the day day 5 feeling great. Just like myself. Not sure if I still have methadone in my system or if I'm clear. It was almost too easy. 

I have 20mg left i may just use it tonight for the fun of it. But don't want to risk getting Methadone withdrawl. 


So yeah I guess I will wait and see how tommorow goes but I think I just got off a gram a day heroin habbit with no withdrawal at all really.

Never shot up. Most I‚Äôve done at once is ~ 240mg - 300mg of some oxy. I‚Äôve cut down recently (due to not having money for it) so I use sparsely through the week. 

The reason I‚Äôm making this post is just to vent a little and to share. I live with my gf who I love dearly. She‚Äôs not an addict or anything but she loves me too. She knows what I do for the most part. I feel like I played her yesterday.

I was upset because I didn‚Äôt have any weed or pills. The fucked up part is I guilt her until I get what I want. I‚Äôll dis her and disrespect her and even go as far as to act like I‚Äôm packing up and leaving for the night. I‚Äôve done it many times. I know I play on her insecurities by doing that too. I feel so rotten. I don‚Äôt deserve her kind love and affection. This is a regular thing that happens. Anyways, she gave me $30 for gas and weed, which I bought, but $15 went to pills.. she didn‚Äôt find out..

I care so much about her. I‚Äôm shackled by these drugs. I‚Äôve always told her, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have you both.‚Äù I‚Äôve tried to let her go multiple times but we stick together. I‚Äôve gone to rehab once for a month and that was really hard for her. 

I‚Äôm sorry this post is getting long. I‚Äôve been lurking on this subreddit for a while. I‚Äôm glad that for a drug so isolating that we are able to connect with each other somehow. I just wanted to share with you guys what is going on in my life. Also, to share how this drug is fundamentally changing me as a person. ",1542468111.0

If I ever try to get clean I replace opiates with a heap of regular cardio to help with my chronic pain and get those endorphins flowing. 

I have a month of annual leave coming up and was originally planning on trying to get clean again but I kinda know I'm not ready and feel like I've failed before I even started, plus I've been sooo depressed all week just thinking about stopping using in a week. So I'm kinda thinking there's no real point in wasting my precious leave and going through all that pain of tapering etc. If I'm just going to get back to work and start using again. 


But I digress, have many people here been successful in maintaining a regular exercise routine while still using daily? I think if I can aim to have some balance on my leave and still go and swim 1km a day then get high I would at least feel like I've accomplished something worthwhile while still getting high and having fun. I know if I just nod out for 3 weeks straight I'm gonna feel like shit about it when the time is up. Do people think this is doable? I've always struggled to maintain any balance in my life so if people have some successful exercise/using schedules/stories to help motivate me that would be great.

Have been trying to cop for the past 48 hours...Thursday night went to all shit because of this non-Fucking snow storm that blanketed the north east with like 3 inches of snow during rush hour, which basically rendered the northern part of my state useless for 8 hours (my girl was stuck at work for an extra 4 hours after working a 12 hour shift and it still took her 3.5 hours to get home where it normally takes 45 minutes).  By the time she got home my dboy, who swore he‚Äôd stay away for me (and normally does) passed the fuck out.

Got a message this morning (Friday) saying my bad, I got you whatever time you can come through today.  So 6pm rolls around and he says yea he‚Äôs good but I gotta meet him in the hood, which I absolutely hate as there‚Äôs no good reason for a white boy to be in the hood...but I was mentally committed.  So I embarked on the 55 minute drive, mind you he was also on his way there and I was literally 5 minutes behind him.  When he got there he calls me and says how long and I told him just stay in your car I‚Äôm LITERALLY TWO MINUTES from you.  When I get there I call him and he goes ‚Äúthere‚Äôs some shady shit going on I‚Äôll hit you back in a minute‚Äù (FAMOUS DBOY WORDS FOR WHO THE FUCK KNOWS IF ILL HIT YOU BACK BEFORE THE NEXT BIG BANG).  So, I find his car and park in front of him and...surprise surprise...he doesn‚Äôt answer.  I‚Äôm already incredibly uncomfortable chillin in the hood so after 30 minutes I bounce.  Complete waste of 2 hours, tolls, and gas.

After I‚Äôm home for an hour he hits me back saying my bad I‚Äôll be back home, meet me there.  So I drive BACK up to him, another 40 minutes.  Tells me to meet him at Walmart (which is normal)...so I go inside and grab some McDonald‚Äôs and he texts me 1 minute...I finish up and go outside and POOF.  No answer and now his phone is going to VM.  Mind you he‚Äôs been my main guy for years and typically is on point (for a dboy).  I wait another 30 mins and then drive back home, frustrated as all hell...tail between my legs.

At least I have some temazepam and a couple good beers to take the edge off...but fuck this life, this is exactly why I so desperately am trying to get out of it for good.

TL;DR - Drove 2 hours round trip, sat in the hood for 30 minutes for no reason.  Drive another 1.5 hours and sat at a Walmart for 30 minutes for no reason.  Dboys suck.

Hope you all habe better luck on this wonderful Friday and have a great weekend.",1542436652.0

Besides the loperamide I've also got promethazine, gabapentin, hydroxyzine, etizolam, xanax, zofran, seroquel, Diphenhydramine, and pretty much every OTC painkiller and cough medicine.

Hi, i'm Addie, and i'm an addict.
I've been clean for about 7 years now. 
I have noticed in my self, an extra sensitivity to feelings, like, physical feelings, certain textures in my hands. I have other mild mental disorders, so I had initially put these down as that.  Until I met two other addicts in recovery. One for four years and one at 7 with me. They both talk about the same feelings.. it's as simple as sticking your hand in a bin of flour and losing yourself in dopamine soaked brain waves.. 
I always thought it was just me, until the other 7 year was telling me about how he always felt his senses were heightened during the come down. He loved to be touched when dope sick. Whereas me (f) HATED to be touched (for the first/only time ever) when I was sick..
Your skin on mine would feel like a flame or 1000 daggers piercing my flesh till I just wanted to scream in agony..
To each his own, but back to the point..
Do recovered addicts have higher sensations than regular people? Do our brains so need to release that feeling of pleasure that we can release on contact with minuscule things? If anyone else feels this way, feel free to let me know. Non judgy obvs. I've done alot of googling and nothing to the science behind the feeling.

Interesting post!," Okay as being a user and a dealer I'm going to say this. Yes it's frustrating as fuck to deal with dealers like that. But when I did sell drugs I acted different. I had tons of money and was fucked up 24/7. I didn't really need the money or care too much. I was chilling, smoking playing video games or something and if someone wanted bud or coke or whatever. I didn't really want to risk going anywhere and I knew you would come to me as for the excuses they are for you to not get upset or wait longer. (It really doesn't make too much sense but it does at the time). We not want to go or drive or we are running late due to chilling and getting fucked up. Most people would get pissed off if we said we will be there in 3 hours. We might lose a sale. We would rather lie to keep the business. This shouldn't always be the case but sometimes it is. I could go on and on and I've been on both sides I know it is frustrating as fuck. But anyways I have a month clean now and moved away from the area I was in to get clean. Don't know where to score around here and trying to get a job that I went to college for. But im back with my parents, my car is pretty sketchy to drive and I've been stuck inside for 2 weeks. I just want to go out and do something. I am starting to get urges to use because I am hella bored and depressed sitting inside all day. ",1542423578.0

About 78% of the posts I've read contain mostly disclaimers and don't have actual info that pertain to the questions in them. And for a good reason, H is a fucking trap. I understand. 


So, I'm really looking for info on how to do this safely. I've read all the variations of disclaimers that there are. I'm sorry if this comes across as arrogant, not trying to be. I've just found it a little frustrating to find real in-depth info that I can use to try and avoid harming myself. Obligatory ""don't do heroin if you wanna avoid harming yourself"" (but again that's a valid argument).


I can't get pills where I live, at all, so I'm tryin' H. Never done Opiates. 

* Is smoking or monkey water a better way to dip my toes in at first? I have some fentanyl test strips, so I will at least be knowing to some extent if what I'm about to ingest is Fentanyl or not. 


* Can anyone tell me what sort of experience I might expect from Tar my first time around? I'm thinking of just ripping off a tiny teeny little tear the size of maybe Abe Lincoln's nose on a penny. And either smoking that or using it with monkey water. 


* With smoking or monkey water, how can I tell if I'm in a danger zone with how my body is reacting? Like, will I realize that I'm close to ODing? I don't have any friends.. so, it's not really an option for me to do it with someone. 


* Is being Opiate Naive, different than not being opiate naive but having no tolerance?


Curious if anyone has been in the same position as me, uhm, and I'm really just trying to not die my first go around with opiates. Considering it's the 2nd most potent one.

I've been scammed and had to argue with people who brought a good sample but then tried selling me shit when I bought big.. So..

I was once staying at my ex place for a month and her neighbor was selling dope, so naturally I mixed it up with him, I got in good with him and I got his number. I live in Europe and we have a lot of #3 and people normally smoke it, but I prefer to snort and this guy had #4 so it was a fucking jackpot.

Anyways time flies, I break up with the skank, dude moves out, changes his number and I lose all contact. Then I get a call from someone, explaining that he is now the owner of my plug's phone and is working instead of the plug I met. He gave me a free sample but it was some garbage dope and I maybe called him once or twice.

After a while his number goes offline and I get another call from him asking to meet up and he offers me another half a gram as a free sample. Dope he gave me was even worse than before and I forgot to save his number so I was doomed to buying from middle men.

About a week ago I start wishing that my phone would ring and the voice on the other side would go; ""Hey it's me, new number, got time? I got something for you.."" You could call this The Secret ‚Ñ¢  or the law of attraction but I got the call today.

""Hey it's me. \*\*PLUG\*\*'s girl, you remember me right? I got the phone and I salvaged your number, give me a call if you want to meet up.""

Oh my god!! JJ is real! This was the girl from the plug that I originally met, before he sold the phone and those dudes started selling weak junk.. I told her to meet me right away & she even delivered to my place which is out in the suburbs. I was skeptic because of the shit dope that I got before so I only bought a gram.. Shieet I should've bought 5. It's that fire #4! I can snort it without any preparations or clogging in my nose, it isn't cut with shit, she delivers anywhere and said she would even front because she remembers how stand up I was when dealing with her man.

I'm so fucking happy.And to anyone that read this far, the plug I originally met is currently locked up. His girl is holding shit down tho.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - I had a dope plug and he went MIA. I went through weak dope, short bags, lost contacts, more shit dope and got back in contact with the fire plug again.

During a weekend trip last month with my longterm girlfriend/love of my life I Od‚Äôd. The thing is she didn‚Äôt know I was hooked no one in my entire life barring my mom knew. I was real good at hiding it because I have a good job and pay bills and have no debt. So when I went to bed and turned blue and woke up to EMTs and my girlfriend apologizing for calling the cops the only thing I could think was ‚Äúwow great fuck up‚Äù. I had  ruined everything. My girlfriend who all I want to do is protect can‚Äôt stop telling me (not passive aggressively but just through random conversation) how she has nightmares about seeing me again having dead eyes and gasping looking lifeless. I traumatized the only thing I really love and she will never ever look at me the same again. 

This is a woman who doesnt touch weed or alcohol and to be told by the hospital I was on heroin was definitely the first time I saw real disappointment in her eyes. I cannot for the life of me pull myself out of this funk knowing how much hurt I caused. Whenever I zone out or daydream all I feel is like I‚Äôm being narcaned and throwing up her screaming. God I am a fucking idiot. I hate how much of a shitbag I am. 

She stayed next to me when I was recovering in the hospital because I wasnt taking in enough oxygen and was still in shock. She told me stories of when she was a child. She told me if she ever found out I was back on it she would have to rethink ‚Äúus‚Äù. So instead of sticking to weed like I told her here I am on the couch nose full of boy. I cannot find a reason why I am this way like any other person here. 

I do not deserve her. But she won‚Äôt leave me even though I try to let her go. Why can‚Äôt I just realize what a blessing I have in a woman who sees me dead and still wants to get married and start a family. But no I am watching youtube blasted on the couch.

I think it‚Äôs about time I get a small amount of Oxy again (I haven‚Äôt had any in months) and this time, I was looking at getting some OxyContin ER rather than IR.

I currently have a small tolerance to Tramadol, but that should quickly dissipate as I stop taking them now. Back when I last had oxy, I would take 10-20mg of IR stuff which would have me feeling real good and occasionally nodding. I generally have a pretty low tolerance to most things. 

So, rather than getting IR this time, I am considering getting some OxyContin 40mg ER since they‚Äôre much cheaper and with my low tolerance, I figure 40mg of ER would have me feeling real good for the whole night; saving me from re-dosing etc.

Finally i'm working on becoming stable, mentally and situationally. Happiness is still elusive but i know i will find more of it with time with this path and i want to stay on it for once.

But man oh man am i still an addict. Going without a cigarette for a while is rough. Going without weed is pretty bad too. Im always drowning out the noise in any way i can and i need to work on it, before it gets me in trouble again.

I took adderall last night & today (got some sleep somehow) and i loved it last night but at work today i just wanted a cigarette the whole damn shift. I still worked hard and did my job right but i was so fuckin awkward & i hated almost every minute of being there despite breezing through the work. Which i'm always awkward and good at my job but my pupils could have been noticable & i was acting a little out of the ordinary. Fingers crossed i didnt fuck up my promotion lmaooooo

I did it a lot in high school but never felt like i needed it. Part of me thinks i can do it recreationally still, but the better part of me knows it's a rocky road because i thought i could do opiates recreationally and uhhhhhh NOPE. Im just trying to fill a void or something. It's only gonna lead to more trouble. 

But guess what? Prolly gonna keep doing it cuz it's available and it helps me get through life a little easier (outside of work) and i know i shouldnt but this desire to get some sort of rush & escape is ingrained into me. I don't think i can beat it head on. i need to weaken it by finding the deeper problems. But alas. Life is a struggle.

Couldn't catch an Oxy high for shit after that. I think the Bupe raised my tolerance or something cause in the past I would stop and go back and be fine getting high but this was the only time I took subs daily for like an entire week. So I spent over a week taking oxies and not getting high.   


So why burn my money on pills that aren't working. I went back to the subs. It's weird though cause I've discovered subs work as a good substitute for my old addiction. Like even though I don't get high I get excited in the morning when I wake up just knowing i got that morning dose coming. Then I get excited in the afternoon or evening when I can take my second dose.   


I usually crush my morning dose into a powder and snort it. 2mg of Bupe just somehow gets me kinda amped up and it just works like a substitute for dope or oxy.  I know many people end up addicted to Suboxone for years but hell if it keeps me clean and I can go about my life normally in all other ways then why the hell not.

This is my first time attempting to IV oxycodone. I‚Äôm not unfamiliar with needles as I‚Äôve run multiple AAS cycles, so needles do not bother me. But I do have a few questions for you great people. 1) All I have on hand are 29g needles  with 3cc syringes. Would this tear my veins to shit or would I be ok with occasionally using these til I get more? 2) If I‚Äôm planning to IV roughly 15mg at a time, does the amount of water used have any effect? 3) I‚Äôm assuming I do not need to cook oxy once it has been dissolved in water, correct? Would I still need a cotton in this situation? 4) What dosage should I start with? My tolerance is pretty high, ~300mg+ a day of Oxy, with 300mg being a low day. 
Thank you to everyone that replies and gives advice. I really appreciate it. 
A little backstory on my habit and tolerance: I‚Äôve used opiates for 10+ years. The first 3 yrs being Oxy, the next 5 yrs was heroin, and the last 2 yrs have been strictly Oxy with less than a handful of times where I‚Äôve used H. 
No need for harm reduction. I‚Äôve been to hell and back with this habit and I‚Äôm well aware of the risks. 
Thanks again to all those who reply

> [Luke] No, I'm 90-days clean. Ninety-two, actually.


> Yeah, but that's not clean.

Keep in my these arent individually wrapped in tape or anything. Its just 10 baggies folded over eachother w a rubber band. Wjen she gave it to me i noticed it was damp but not super wet and when i got home about 5 min later i noticed the bags were clearly wet so i hit it woth a hairdryer as fast as i could. Theres still a little bit of powder in each bag but not a whole ton. My question is do you think all the good shit absorbed into the bags? The shit inside the bags should still be good rite? Keep in mind the bags werent SOAKED but they were decently wet. Im just worried all the good shit was sucked into the bags and the powder thats left is useless. Also what should i do with the baggies incase they absorbed some? Should i just rip em open and leave them under my to gue or just eat them? Fuck man what a shitty start to this winter.

The last time I used was 2 weeks prior to getting the Vivitrol, and after that I gave my dad all my savings to hold on to (so that I wouldn't blow the money on dope). On the morning of my appointment for the Vivitrol shot, they tested my urine and then gave me a shot of Narcan as a ""test"" to make sure I didn't have any opiates in my system. The Narcan immediately made me feel kind of like a (very mild) version of opiate withdrawal. It wasn't unbearable, but I was definitely having cold sweats, loss of appetite, restless leg, needing to use the bathroom, etc. The doctor told me if I we t ahead with the Vivitrol shot, I would keep feeling like that for at least 2 days and then it would probably go away but he ""couldn't guarantee anything.""

I tried to tell my dad I didn't want the shot and I didn't want to feel like shit for (possibly) a whole month, but he said if I didn't get the shot, he was throwing me lut on the street and keeping all my money (that I had given him to hold) so that I wouldn't be able to get a place to stay. I had no choice but to get the shot.

It's been 2 days and I still feel like I'm in mild withdrawal, although I do feel a bit better today than I did on Wednesday. I have been doing some research, and it turns out Vivitrol blocks your brain's natural pleasure chemicals in addition to blocking opiatese, resulting in an inability to feel pleasure.

I have had some people tell me that Vivitrol starts to wear off as soon as 2 1/2 to 3 weeks, but I also read a post here on r/opiates by a guy who said he tried to use opiates 31 days after taking Vivitrol and didn't feel a thing (meaning the Vivitrol hadn't even begun to wear off).

I'm definitely not going back in a month for my next shot, and I hope this one wears off ASAP.

Anyone else have any experience with Vivitrol? Do you start to feel better after a while? How long does it really take to start wearing off?",1542333318.0

9xhk8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9xhk8k/drug_screen/,11,https://redd.it/9xhk8k,Ajhmxr2,Drug screen.,So my husband has been having stomach issues and the dr sent him to the er so they could do blood work and ct scan. They also did a urine test. Anyway fast forward the dr calls and says they did a urine drug screen on him. First question who most likely ordered this? His doctor who sent him there for tests or the er dr. The pcp originally just said blood and ct. Well he wasnt informed of a screen it showed positive for weed benzo and methamphetamine. He can account for the benzo and weed. Yet it didnt show opiate which he had taken 2 days prior and that was prescribed to him from said dr. He had gotten valium from the VA a few months ago and took the leftovers during a stressful time recently. Well the methamphetamine is where we are confused. What can cause that? He did get adderal from a friend at school so he could do a bunch of work over the week I had no clue till I heard the dr say it. I've looked and it says that shows as amphetamines not meth the dr even asked if he had bought any street meth illegally. I'm so stressed because we see the same dr and I get a monthly script of valium and do not give him mine so unless he stole some it was not from me. Will the dr want to drug test me? Cut me off? I mean all that will show is valium for me. But I'm worried he will think I gave him some. He can print off showing he got them from the VA. I'm so stressed. ,1542332252.0

Never anything shady just spent hard earned money on them. When I do it for a couple days I feel it and as soon as one 30 doesn't get me right I lay off for a while. I have I guess had some irritability from not having them but that's a mind thing imo. What I'm trying to say is I'll cop some and party on a weekend or something with my girl but we don't HAVE to have them. It's weird.

Snorted the smallest bit and was fucked. Then we fucked and neither of us could get off. While we both liked the feeling we both like getting fucked up and having sex and being able to finish more lol.

I am originally from the east coast but I now reside in the west, which has been a hard conversion for the addict in me as I can't stand black tar. I deal with the black tar because its all we have, but I won't shoot it only smoke it.  So any chance I have I go home and stock up. ...GETTING TO THE POINT so anyway of course everyone is like use the DNM's you can get the world best ecp direct! Sounded to good to be true, but I tried it. Now don't get me wrong I am not by any means knocking the DNMs, this is strictly concerning ecp. I tried numerous vendors mostly with high rating but some more low down ones to get a full spectrum. All the product was different looking but it all gave the same effect and certainly did not have really many similar qualities to what I have known and loved to call ecp or at less what I am used to (stamped bag quality). All the stuff from the DNM seemed to be maybe some kind of home lab made#5 or maybe a research chemical, I am really not sure but they were smokable substances and that is certainly not what I am used to with ecp. The rush was also really strange on all of them... it gives you that pins and needle rush like tar but then you don't feel high sedated like you just feel disoreiented. All and all I was pretty bummed and now I have a drawer full of unused ""substances"" that cost me a boat load and well they just don't quite do it for me. ANYWAY my question is does anyone know about this or what substances this vendors are selling, because clearly they all got the same memo which read"" Hey I know this stuff that we could pass off as ecp, its cheap and will still get them feeling some kind of way""   Im just curious if anyone else has been experiencing this     AND TO ANYONE ORDERING ECP FROM THE DNM beware

I've been at my methadone clinic for years and have been clean off everything else for a very long time now, so when kits became available I was never even asked if I wanted one by the nurses or doctors, but I assume it was cuz of the fact I don't use and haven't in a long time.

  


But this past week I've been given 2 one at my clinic and one at a pharmacy that I used to get methadone from so they had that on my record and they asked me if I wanted a kit so I said sure to both kits. I live in Canada where they are always free, but I live on a street where there is a temp homeless shelter at the end of it and I always drive by and see cops and ambulances there a lot and ppl always hanging out outside and I've seen a few ppl OD as I saw paramedics issue narcan the nasal spray. So I thought it would be smart to have a kit or 2 on me when I go out just in case. I don't know anyone personally that uses anymore so it really would just be used on the off chance I'm driving by and someone is passed out and I have no problem going to check it out if it means I can help faster then paramedics. But it's getting colder where I am and snowing a lot more and temperatures below freezing and I originally thought I'll just put the kits in my car, but would the solution in the nasal spray freeze and be useless that way?

  


I have children and one is very young and into everything so having it out in the open so I can remember to take it with me everytime I go out isn't really an option for me as I would have to put it somewhere way out of reach which will definitely make me forget about it all the time. Where I am isn't nearly as bad as so many places in the states but we have ODs enough here that I want to help if I can but I just thought about temps being colder and if the solution would freeze or not.",1542320952.0

So in the meantime, he scripted me 8mg pills of Subutex he told me to cut them down to quarters and start there.  He wrote for a two week supply 2x/day so 30 pills of 8mgs, but my insurance only covers 7 days worth so I got 14 pills instead. 

Luckily I'll be cutting them into halves and fourths so I won't need to get more than '7 days worth' each month until we can petition the insurance and get them to either approve the Butrans patch or whatever. If I like the Subutex I can work with him to stay on that versus the Butrans patch, but he's totally willing to give me a hand with everything which is helpful. 

If I get on the Subutex regularly and we can get the insurance to allow more than '7 days worth' then I can stockpile it and never be truly out unlike what would happen with my regular oxycodone.

How do you deal with Heroin/Opiate Addicts?,"Everyone loves to hate on the Piggies. So, I'm just curious how you (knowing what you know now about the lifestyle, misery, etc... of severe opiate addiction) would prosecute/not-prosecute the Heroin/Opiate Pill Addicts who've been arrested and end up in your court room. Let's say the crime is something directly related to supporting his or her addiction. Lets say they've been charged with something like Theft Over $200 - a Class D Felony, and for all the other relevant factors USE YOUR CURRENT SITUATION TO FILL IN THE GAPS (aka just use YOUR current Criminal History, Financial Situation Determining Whether You'll Have A Paid Lawyer or just Public Pretender, Age, Race, Location, Employment, are you currently on Probation or Parole?, Etc..)

&#x200B;

Depending on where you live (probably keep that information to yourself a la sub rules) this crime in a large city might be considered next to nothing to you as a Judge because you see this type of crime all day, everyday with people supporting their habits. On the flipside a drug addict robbing someone or somewhere to support their drug habit - in a small town this might be looked at as a MAJOR, Serious big deal - where you'll be made out to be public enemy #1 (I've seen both.. Hell, I've lived both...Just depends on the City/Judge)

&#x200B;

Okay, myself... If I were the Judge preceding over a case like this, and we were in fact able to find this guy or girl guilty of theft I would force (say it's a girl) her to get a mental health evaluation, because we all know lots of drug addicts have a dual diagnosis and also suffer from mental illness on top of drug addiction... And generally speaking, most of the time, these mental health conditions are undiagnosed, and sadly even if they are diagnosed that's usually just about the end of their treatment. It's either way too expensive, or it's frustrating, confusing, and just overall very difficult to fucking find help out here once they know that you are a DRUG ADDICT (Dr's seem to really kind of just not give a fuck about opiate addicts and try to keep use at a distance away from them) .

&#x200B;

Fast Forward .. As the Judge I would make her complete an in depth mental health evaluation and to follow through with any and all recommendations that spawn from it. Also, if she is unemployed (which I assume she is because she's stealing for Oxys or Heroin). Then I would force her to complete a 30 Day inpatient rehab with AMA'ing resulting in an immediate warrant for her arrest & finally my ""Special Tactic"" I would COURT ORDER her to receive VIVITROL INJECTION every 30 days for 24 months... Any missed shots would result in an instant warrant for her arrest - with random drug testing several times a month looking for things like meth, coke, etc to biohack the Vivitrol Shot.

&#x200B;

So basically, I'd give her 24months probation w/ mandatory monthly vivitrol shots and lots of random drug testing and if she completed all this I would totally erase everything from her record. I would also require her to get job.

&#x200B;

What tactics would you use to try and help this person?? Knowing what you know now about the severity of opiate addiction and physical dependency/withdraw.  How do you feel about my idea of forcing a monthly Vivitrol Injection (if she didn't want it she absolutely did NOT have to accept that's what trails and lawyers are for.

Interesting read! I've always been skeptical about these sorts of things. I'm going to start trying them out for shits & giggles. I'd be interested to hear of people's personal experiences üòäü§òüá¨üáß,"The Categories

In general opiate potentiators usually fall into one of these categories:

-	Antihistamines
-	CYP enzymes inhibitors
-	NMDA antagonists
-	Muscle-relaxants
-	Other CNS depressants
-	Phytochemicals

The Big List

There are literally dozens of chemicals that can potentiate opiates, many with similar mechanisms. We will start with the most well-known ones slowly move into the more novel ones as we go down the list.

-	Grapefruit Juice ‚Äì The classic. Works by blocking the enzymes that metabolize opioids, thus increasing opiate concentration and duration. Usually, a 500ml of real 100% grapefruit juice will work fine. This is simple and works modestly for most people.

-	Cimetidine (also known as Tagamet) ‚Äì  Works by occupying CYP enzymes that metabolize opioids (and other drugs), may not be great for the liver as it increases the workload on in. Anecdotally dosage is 800mg. Available over the counter. Works for about an hour. This is the choice for most people, but may affect the metabolization of codeine to morphine.

-	Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) ‚Äì Less itchy and better effects. Inhibits histamine and increases the analgesic and mood properties of opiates to a small degree. In addition, they also inhibit a subset of CYP2D6.

-	Clonidine ‚Äì Dosages 0.1mg to 0.3 mg. Stronger rush of effects. Sometimes quoted as the strongest potentiators also known as Catapres. 

-	Benzos ‚Äì Not potentiation and a dangerous combination, but can be complementary to changing the effects of opiates at a low dose.

-	Quinine (Tonic Water) ‚Äì makes opiates last longer and act stronger. It inhibits the CYP450 set, more specifically, CYP2D6. It doesn‚Äôt attach to as many enzymes as Cimetidine does, but it strongly attach to CYP2D6, which is the MAIN enzyme for opiates like oxycodone, heroin, hydromorphone, etc. A large glass of straight tonic water is plenty.

-	Promethazine ‚Äì Any other sedative anticholinergic antihistamine will work to reduce opiate side effects and potentiate analgesia. Take after administration of opiate not before.

-	CPM (Chlorpheniramine maleate) ‚Äì Same as above.

-	Cyclizine ‚Äì Same as above.

-	Anafranil  ‚ÄìA Tricyclic antidepressant that could potentiate opiates. Antidepressants pop up in patents for potentiation, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be many anecdotal experiences on the web.

-	DXM ‚Äì Actually a tolerance reversal and prevention agent, since it‚Äôs also an NMDA Antagonist, but we will pile it on this list. DXM is a whole potent analgesic drug itself. Dosage is 30mg of DXM a good half hour. This chemical is highly illegal in some countries (only available as cough syrup in some) due to potential for abuse. There is ample scientific evidence on this one but remains controversial.

-	Proglumide and Memantine ‚Äì Proglumide naturally enhances opiate effects as well as reverses tolerance over time. Memantine is like DXM an NMDA antagonist, only its non-competitive so it doesn‚Äôt have any strong effects like DXM on its own. These are tolerance reversal and prevention agents and I would not classify them as strictly potentiators though they can be used in that way.

-	Magnesium ‚Äì Efficacy is unknown as there are multiple forms of Magnesium. Magnesium also acts as an NMDA antagonist. Magnesium Maleate is usually the one quoted as having effects. If anything it is good at calming nerves and reducing things like bruxism.

-	Loperamide (Immodium) ‚Äì 2mg. A little unclear whether this works or not. The theory is that loperamide occupy gut opiate receptors, thus freeing up more opiates to act on the brain. Seems to enhance analgesic effects more than mood effects, though.

-	Doxylamine Succinate (Active Ingredient in Nyquil) ‚Äì Works to enhance effects, commonly used.

-	Orphenadrine ‚Äì Anticholinergic used to treat muscle spasms, potentiator because it is strong anticholinergics. Acts on ALOT of mechanisms including being a moderate NMDA receptor antagonist.

-	Cyclobenzaprine ‚Äì Same as above

-	Carisoprodol (Soma) ‚Äì Same as above.

-	Propoxyphene ‚Äì Huge potentiator of opium, but for other opiates it is unknown.

-	Naproxen ‚Äì Non-selective COX inhibitor. Adds analgesia and increases mood effects. COX  inhibitors reliably have shown in studies and patents to potentiate opiate effects. Other drugs of the same class may have effects also.

-	Cat‚Äôs Claw ‚Äì Increases Duration, specifically for Methadone. Also an NMDA antagonist too.

-	Baking Soda ‚Äì Only necessary for oral ingestion affects PH of the stomach to allow more opiates to be absorbed into the blood.

-	Rhodiola and Ashwagandha ‚Äì Clinical studies show potentiation and tolerance reversal. We have some other herbs listed in this blog post.

And there are probably others that can potentiate opiates, its hard to include everything ever. These other ones have reports of working, but don‚Äôt have confirmed mechanisms.

-	Black Seed Oil (cumin seed)
-	Hordenine (very minute amounts, 5 ‚Äì 20mg, even. MAO-B inhibitor ‚Äì works great if you don‚Äôt use too much)
-	Tribulus Terrestris (a milder MAO-B inhibitor. This is also great as it boosts testosterone and brings the ‚Äòlibido‚Äô back which opiates can diminish)
-	DLPA (this is great unless your tolerance is high, then it doesn‚Äôt do much)
-	Curcumin (around 2g taken with Piperine ‚Äì this potentiates the potentiator )
-	DMSO = yup, it‚Äôs a potentiator and it seems to feel similarly to how Hordenine & Tribulus bring the ‚Äòmagic‚Äô back to strains when tolerance is being a ‚Äòbitch‚Äô so to speak. We are using this stuff for the soaps and lotions, that‚Äôs how rubbing the lotion = pain relief and relaxation. It‚Äôs an interesting product, look it up: DMSO (organic)

Example Extreme Opiate Potentiation Regiment

1.	Taking a combination of the CYP450 set inhibitors can drastically increase blood plasma levels of opiates.
2.	45 Minutes before administration ‚Äì 10mg Memantine + 600mg Proglumide would be good to combine with a regiment to prevent further tolerance and withdrawal developing.
3.	45 Minutes before administration ‚Äì 600mg Tagamet HB(Cimetidine HCl), a large glass of tonic water (or another source of quinine), and a large glass of (white) Grapefruit juice, preferably from concentrate.
4.	35 Minutes before administration ‚Äì 30mg DXM, 25mg Benadryl(Diphenhydramine HCl), 330mg Naproxen(Aleve).
5.	20 Minutes before administration ‚Äì 2 Tums OR 1.5 Tbsp. of Baking SODA. (Obviously this step only applies if you are eating your opes)
6.	T-0) Administrate your opiateopioid.

You can see how having a tolerance prevention regiment in place can pay off in big ways later, because you can continually use potentiation as needed instead of developing straight up tolerance to higher doses. This means better effects for longer, less side effects, less withdrawals, and a much longer sustainable usage of opiates in the long run.

i got clean awhile ago and got my life headed in the right direction. currently at grad school. handled personal life issues poorly, ended up doing suboxone for about a month. between 8-16mg a week for a month. then i did about 20 bags of dope over a week after i couldn't make it through withdrawal. i only made it 38 hours from my last dose before i felt terrified and bad and went out and bought a sub -kratom and weed and even xanax didnt help me with the restless legs and general anxiety. i took 2mg 2 hours ago and 2 more mg just now but i don't really feel anything. does suboxone no longer give you a high after you've done dope for a little bit? do i just need to take more? i don't think i put myself into precipitated withdrawal but i don't realy feel ""okay"". 

my last question is just about quitting: how much have i reset the process by taking subs today? were the 30some hours i spent pointless? do i have to wait for the subs to fade (fkn long half life) before i start making meaningful progress? i had been hoping to be somewhat clean/presentable for thanksgiving.

thank you so much for any help. i need to make a change now or im gonna lose everything, so i really appreciate any advice.

Just posting this In response to the debate going on below in the oct codeine thread.  the truth is legalizing all drugs is truly the way to go. There are 2 countries in the the world that have done this and the usage, od rate and crime rate all went down. Youth drug rates are at historical lows in both countries.

Portugal- decriminalized 
Uruguay- all legal 

There is a great book called ""chasing the scream"" that starts from when all drugs were legal in the usa to now, or roughly 2015 when it was published. All the research is there both good and bad on both sides. I highly suggest those that think the war on drugs benefits anyone but corporations to read it.

Chasing the scream :)

However, this time the antibiotics did not work, I‚Äôve been in the worst pain of my life since October 27th. 

I‚Äôve lost about 15 pounds due to not being able to eat because of the pain. It literally hurts to talk. I have been getting absolutely no sleep due to the pain

I have another doctors appointment today and if I don‚Äôt get something for the pain I think I‚Äôm going to buy off the streets. 

I‚Äôm a university student and I‚Äôve missed 3 weeks of class and have been in so much pain. I haven‚Äôt been able to get prescribed a couple painkillers so I can eat and drink. I‚Äôll keep you updated if you care 

Edit 1: turns out I tested positive for strep and mono, went to my family doctor and she told me I should go to the ER right then and there, went to the ER and they put me on some IV morphine and then some IV antibiotics, got prescribed some. Also got sent home with a script for Hydrocodone Hycet and some more antibiotics.

Edit 2: dosage of the Hycet is 15mL every 4-6 hours or when needed I have i total of 180mL so that is 12 doses with no refills. Probably took my 8/10 pain and turned it to 4.5/10 and I am able to drink (uncomfortably) but I can lay in bed (comfortably) and this is the biggest selling point for me. Honestly surprised I got a script for some opioids being only 21, but I think they knew I wasn‚Äôt going to abuse it I was just genuinely in pain. 

TLDR: have mono, got morhpine in the ER, got a script for Hydrocodone Hycet ",1542291564.0

I read Tweak and some of Beautiful Boy and I stand how both parties felt the need to bend over backwards explaining that the protagonist was smart, cultured, came from a good family AKA ""NoT LiKe oTHeR aDDiCts""...over and over. It didn't even sound like the kid used for that long. He also sounded like a gigantic pussy which made me question most of his stories. His description of heroin withdrawal was so totally off I don't believe it at all. He described it as like a dream state, like hallucinating, and such.   


It reminds me of something that happened in my area years ago, during the 2nd wave of Fent (This is the 3rd wave, first 2 were from the same dude, he got of prison and started doing it again lol). Black dudes from Detroit had been dropping for weeks without anyone caring but once the suburban white girl OD'd they finally did a crack down, the news stories were written, etc.   


Then on top of it the movie version is clearly just riding the wave of opioid epidemic interest. They're digging mass graves on the East Coast, guys like ASavageLost have better tramadol stories than Nic Sheffield has stories involving his whole drug career, and they choose to make a film on this trustafarian and his turtleneck wearing crybaby dad.  


Sorry for the rant. I'm not a ""street kid"", and I'm not trying to gatekeep, but god it just seems like a WEAK story to get so much traction. Literally any AA/NA meeting will have people with much more interesting and inspirational stories.

I was wondering how fast oxy tolerance goes down and at what rate? Some people say the tolerance is almost permanent or takes years but I always find that false 

I have been on my current oxy binge for about a month now and when I first began it I was taking 30 mg oxy at once.Eventually  my tolerance grew to about 60 mg oxycodone and most  recently 90 mg hydrocodone. 

But the thing is I haven‚Äôt touched a single opiate in 8 days. So I‚Äôm scared to just jump right in to 60mg at once, but at the same time don‚Äôt want 30 or 45 mg to be a let down.

What do you guys reckon? Should I just take the full 60 mg and just get extra high? At the same time I don‚Äôt want to make my tolerance go up if it doesn‚Äôt need to

I‚Äôm just really not sure, what do you guys think is the right dosage ?

Hear me out.,"Since so many of the numbers of disease tramsmission, infections and (often) OD's originate from IV use, why not move the harm reduction thinking over to a form of IV replacement? Like a safe dose kit.

It seems to me that using needles is a choice. There are many ways of dosing opioids without this dangerous method. I understand that OD's and other harm comes from these alternatives methods too, but if there was a safer (non-IV) way to use opioids, it would undoubtedly save lives. Many lives.

Opioids aren't going anywhere. So, what about inexpensive (manufactured) smoking kits? Clinic supplied transdermal patches? Trade-in centers where you trade powdered opioids (heroin) for pill form? 

The US Federal Government has monkeyed around for decades trying to shame users, help users, flip users, bust users, jail users etc. you can't tell me that a safer alternative to needles can't be designed. What do you guys think of focusing on safer dosing?

Edit: I'm not saying that this idea ""replaces"" IV, just that it could offer safety and a step back from danger. Anyone looking for a 100% replacement is asking too much. It's about compromise and safety. ",1542239073.0

Of course they have to ask the pharmacist for it, and the pharmacist is now required to insist on ID and record the sale so they can‚Äôt come back tomorrow when a different pharmacist is working and buy just as much again but it‚Äôs downright harmful that they sell this stuff with so much harmful APAP. Everyone (including the pharmacist) knows only too well that they are buying it for the codeine content and the large amount of acetaminophen aka paracetamol aka APAP is toxic to the liver. **For the love of God I wish they would just give opiate addicts their opiates without insisting on poisoning them!**  This stupid war on drugs is just so wrong and can never be won.

I really think it is much more harmful to sell this with so much toxic APAP than it would be to sell opiates (without including poison). Why can't the people that make these stupid laws recognize that also?

Desperate I actually asked plug 1 (P1) it she knew anyone else I would ask , she gives me a name but says not to mention her name at all . I start small talk with potential new plug (PNC) right away , we question and validate each other's credibility and after about a week I decide to give him a shot. I mention to P1 that I'm gonna give PNP a shot and she says ""Nooooo!! Don't! He'll short you !! He's got garbage!! He'll rob you!!"" Ummm, ok? Whyd you give me his info then I'm thinking right? Scares me off a little bit but the next day I say fuck it and go thru PNP. I needed at like 7am; he was not only awake but responded to my messages in line under 5 minutes. Ok, my first WOW. Then, he tells me to come meet him now, which was like 20 minutes from the beginning of our conversation that day. I go straight there and he comes out immediately , weighs in front of me , takes cash and then we split ways. Whole thing took like45 minutes with driving .

(Because of its opioid properties?),"So I know its a novel dissociative analog of pcp but this particular one has affinty for some opioid receptors and i always remembered when i experimented with it, I would experience relief from opiate WDs immediately.

> The drug also has high affinity for the Œº-opioid receptor (MOR) (Ki = 39‚Äì60 nM),[2][3][4][5] the Œ∫-opioid receptor (KOR) (Ki = 140 nM),[4] and the sigma œÉ1 receptor (Ki = 42 nM; IC50 = 19 nM),[4][6][7][8] whereas it has only low affinity for the Œ¥-opioid receptor (Ki = 2,300 nM).[4] The high affinity of 3-HO-PCP for opioid receptors is unique among arylcyclohexylamines and is in contrast to PCP, which has only very low affinity for the MOR (Ki = 11,000‚Äì26,000 nM; 282- to 433-fold difference) and the other opioid receptors (Ki = 4,100 nM for the KOR and 73,000 nM for the DOR).[3][4]


3-meo-pcp and 3-ho-pcp worked as functional drugs I could use short term for instant antidepressant/anxiolytic effects. Looking for a everyday-/+ functional drug, Im on subs, not trying to get back on opiates, tolerance to amps/stims is too high and I cant afford them or sleep if i take them more than once or twice a week.


**So my question is, first of all, im on ~ 8 - 12 mg subs a day, Will the suboxone block the opioid properties of this drug making it less effective? Basically will I have to wait 24+ hrs after sub for this to work, like i would for opiates?**


2nd, If I take 3-ho-pcp and dose my sub, say a few hrs later, will doing this cause precipitated WD like it would if I took an opiate while on sub? Will I have to wait for the 3-ho to leave my system, or until im in WD, to take sub? (Assuming that taking the 3-ho in the right dose will alleviate most/some WD replacing sub)?


**So to make things short, can I use suboxone and 3-ho-pcp together, or do I need to treat the 3-ho just like any other opiate when using it alongside subs?** 

If I can't use them together, what about other pcp analogs? O-PCE, 7-ho-PCE, 3-meo-pcp etc??

Any help highly appreciated. I really need something temporarily to get through these SAD episodes and to just get out of bed and function/shower/eat/socialize etc. And cant thing of anything better based on my exp",1542223285.0

-My DNM Bitcoin wallet gets hacked, among others, and I lose $80 that I planned on buying Oxy with.
-I've gotten robbed by TWO heroin/Oxy dealers
-The one time I have a legitimate deal set up to buy heroin, there is a FUCKING COP CAR parked right around the corner, with a cop in it. The dealer refused to sell to me as the dumb fuck thought I was a cop just because my neighbor is.
-Not one, not two, but THREE packages I've ordered now have gone ghost.

The one with shitty ratings got refunded to me and the one that I've bought from before claims to have sent a reship, which I am still waiting on.

I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of posts lately asking people what the most fucked up thing they did for opiates was and boy have I got a story for you guys....

Now usually it‚Äôs the dboy making the girls suck him off for the goods right? But see boys, it‚Äôs the 21st mothafuckin century and we don‚Äôt do oppressive gender role shit no more. Girls have rights now an can do everything a man can and that‚Äôs exactly what happened in this story. 

So this all starts in 2016. 
I had just recently got into opiates and was living on my own with my brother and after a 7 day straight opiate/meth/coke and mdma binge/massive party we had at our house (it was a really nice place in the country, we supported it by dealing stims but I won‚Äôt get into that) we were crashing hard and I mean HARD! 
For the first time in my life I started to feel real withdrawals along with a comedown straight from the seventh layer of hell itself and my go to remedy (oxy) was all gone. 
I knew my script wouldn‚Äôt get filled again for another two weeks but my brother and I‚Äôs withdrawals were not gonna wait that long so we had to come up with a solution fast! Now this is where the title comes into play... 

There was this girl we use to know who was hopelessly infatuated with us during our younger years and recently she had become pretty big into opiates and was known around town for dealing. My brother and I hadn‚Äôt talked with her in years but we knew she would reply right away if we hit her up because of how infatuated she use to be with my older brother and I.

We hit her up and told her we needed some opiates fast! 
We didn‚Äôt give a fuck what kind we just needed something because on top of our withdrawals we were coming down off a 7 day meth, molly coke and oxy binge and we‚Äôve got no landing gear. 
I mean we were crashing harder than a pair of 767‚Äôs into the World Trade Center. 

She replies ASAP and says she‚Äôs got OC 80‚Äôs. 
THANK GOD! 
She tells us she‚Äôs already super fucked up so we‚Äôre gonna have to drive to her. 
No problem, if we can drive on meth we can drive during withdrawals. 
We then ask her how much she wants per pill and this is where it gets nuttier than squirrel shit.... 

I get a paragraph long, detailed description of how this bitch wants my brother and I to pull a train on her in exchange for the oxy and she‚Äôs not gonna accept cash.... 
Before my bro and I even have time to process this bill Cosby, come get my pudding bullshit I get another Snapchat.
It‚Äôs a photo this time but see I‚Äôm already in the worst state of mind of my life so i say fuck it and open it. 
No joke, this bitch straight up sent us a close up photo of her butthole with the caption ‚Äúlooks good huh boys?(;‚Äù. 
Now see, I‚Äôm not opposed to some groceries and neither is my brother but see we haven‚Äôt talked to this girl in years and she‚Äôs as fat as your mother and probably has more bugs than your computer after downloading limewire in the early 2000‚Äôs..

My brother and I both are in complete shock but we don‚Äôt have any fucking time to process this because this is the only plug in town and if we don‚Äôt get some oxy soon we are FUCKED! 
We hop our asses in the car and head out to this bitches house. 
I swear to god this car ride felt like we were in a landing craft about to storm the beaches of Normandy...
We both knew what was about to go down once those doors opened but we‚Äôre just two young men who don‚Äôt have a choice and we‚Äôve got a job to do. 

Que 45 minutes of some horribly regrettable sex and occasional awkward eye contact with each others dicks, she told us she was satisfied and we could have 3, oc80‚Äôs each. 
Now that wasn‚Äôt good enough for my brother and I. 
I mean we straight up moby dicked this bitch for almost an hour with no prior whaling experience and we needed good compensation for our time so we managed to convince her to give us 6 each instead. 
In hindsight, we made it out of there rich as kings but good god did we feel like human garbage...

We get back home and by now each of us were right about to retire to our rooms and enjoy our nods (preferably in a bath of hydrogen peroxide) when we both get a notification on Facebook from the girl. 

To this day I don‚Äôt know why, but we accepted her friend request and no more than 10 minutes later we see on our newsfeed that she updated her status.
All it said was:
Another win for feminism.

Hope you guys enjoyed this because I sure as hell didn‚Äôt but it‚Äôs been a few years so I figured I‚Äôd finally share this one.
That was by far the worst thing I had ever done for drugs and for some reason the biggest revelation I got out of it that day was ‚Äúman feminism has come a long way‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm clean and sober now and finishing up my doctorate in pharmacology and doing well. 
I managed to not get any STD‚Äôs from her and for those sensitive fucks out there, I have nothing against feminism and I have zero prejudice, I just needed to share this story and that‚Äôs just the way it happened. 
Figured this sub was perfect for this and as always guys, 
Happy nods.

9wxnz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9wxnz6/how_much_of_phyiscal_withdrawal_do_you_think_is/,7,https://redd.it/9wxnz6,LittleBigCheeks,How much of phyiscal withdrawal do you think is actually mental?,"I have been thinking about this a lot today. First, I want to say that I'm not implying physical wds are made up or exaggerated in any way, or that people are not suffering during wd, because I've been through it countless times and know as well as you guys that it's a living hell. Obviously, there are clear, awful physcial symptoms.

I also already know that there is a huge mental part to withdrawal. The anxiety, depression, restlessness, hopelessness, and boredom is definitely the hardest part for me and lasts longer than physical wds. My question is simply, do you think some part of the *physical* symptoms are actually more *mental*?

I definitely think so, to some degree. I was just pondering this while thinking how some of my detoxes seemed strangely easy and some seemed impossible. For example, the first time I ever got dope sick, I was out of town and didn't even know what was happening. I thought I had a bad flu and I was also having crying spells, but it wasn't *that* bad. When I finally used again and felt better, I did some research and realized that I was in too deep and physically addicted.

Of course, as that was my first time wding, my addiction wasn't as heavy at the time so I know that's the main reason it seemed bearable. Mentally, though, I think that not even knowing I was wding made it easier, because I hadn't yet realized another bag would cure all. Like, I was wondering if a non-addict could suddenly experience wd symptoms without knowing it's wd, would they find it more tolerable than an addict? Would it be easier because they would not also be struggling with mental addiction, and would just resign themselves to ""I've got a bad flu, just need to get through this""? I think knowing there's such an easy solution to the physical symptoms makes it more difficult.

Similarly, I find that the more bearable detoxes, both with and without Suboxone, are when I'm resigned to quit. When I'm prepared for what's coming and I know getting more dope is not an option, the wds a little more tolerable than when I'm just out of dope, or when I'm half-heartedly trying to get clean. Then it just seems like the worst.

My easiest detoxes have been with Suboxone, but even then, I've had some terrible ones where the 24 hours waiting to take the sub is complete hell and I don't make it, because I don't really want to quit and I know a bag will fix it. Yet, when I'm determined to get clean, there have been times when I'm surprised at how easy the 24 hours were, and then the sub obviously helps and a week later, I'm like damn! That wasn't bad at all! Again, I'm strictly talking about physcial symptoms, I of course still struggle mentally. But my experience indicates to me that the physical aspect is a little mental as well. One last example was rehab; I did a quick sub taper but did not start the subs until 36 hours in. Though not the easiest 36 hours, they were better than other times simply because I knew I had no other option. After those hours I was medicated, so it was obviously fine.

I know that sometimes addicts want to quit but are too scared of withdrawal, and I think anticipating horrible physical symptoms could actually make it worse.

What do you guys think?",1542177850.0

9wwwtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9wwwtl/white_powder_but_not_fent/,13,https://redd.it/9wwwtl,jamesmartin420,White powder but not fent?,"**update - It was not legit heroin & was a fentanyl analouge according to the hospital. Did a line and next minute. So to all those people ""graduating"" from pharmaceuticals to street opiates. I'd inject the pharmaceuticals too and did for years without any complications.. while with the so called H that was truly just fent I only snorted (aka street opiates which I've only done 4 times in my life. 1 of which I came close to ODing and the second aka this time I did) ! So don't think Route of admin makes a difference with fent or makes it any less strong. 

Just stick to pharmaceuticals and if u were like me who couldn't find them due to being in a new place don't buy street opiates and just stop. Especially these days where heroin is not guaranteed due to fentanyl existing and being so prevalent.
So anyone thinking of doing this and lives on the west coast of Canada or anywhere near it be aware that heroin is pretty much non existent here these days and due to our proximity to China it's 90% of the time fentanyl or an analogue. Even in the rest of North America it seems to be the case looking at OD stats.
That and it's clearly not evenly dispersed the dose of fent in the powder. I did a line a similar size earlier in the day and turned out to be fine from that but not the line before bed. 

I'm back home now after being woken up to narcan and an oxygen mask on me...luckily was a relapse as I guess if I was dependent still/hadn't been clean for a good stint, that narcan would have sent me into straight WD.
I've now been discharged but Im being told I almost died and wouldn't have lived if it was not for my roommate hearing gasping for air from my room. He thought I was jerking off or something lol but despite that came in to find me not breathing or without pulse. 
Luckily he called 911 asap as I'd been out for approx 30 mins. He luckily new cpr and mouth to mouth.
Which just about kept me alive until the ambulance came into my building with narcan & oxygen.** 
I'd like to thank the first responders. While I'm suicidal and wish I was dead, they didn't know that and the only reason I'm glad / haven't actually acted on it is because I can't imagine what that would do to my loved ones . They're the only ones keeping me alive ***

Ia it possible legit white China heroin/dicetylmorphine still exists ? 

I recently obtained some what I thought was fentanyl. As well, it was plain white powder.  However after doing a line it burnt a little bit but still hardly so vs other drugs...  where the fentanyl I've had in the past didn't at all and is as smooth as coke or something. 

But what makes me think that it's not fent most of all is that from just the small amount I snorted, it lasted a good 5-6 hours. Vs so called previous batches of fentanyl which lasts a couple to max a few hours. 

Even after that initial high and nod passed after  the 5-6 hour mark, it was clearly still in my system as I didn't feel sick, no physical pain and my eyes were still not as pinpointed as during the peak but still pinpoints for a few hours after that.

So thinking it's a) legit China white or b) some fentanyl analouge that lasts much longer than fentanyl itself. If that even exists ? 

If it helps I'm in the Pacific Northwest west. Aka just across the sea from China. Where typically any white powder it almost guaranteed to be fent.

I‚Äôve had a taste for them ever since I was 14 getting my wisdom teeth out. I‚Äôve always been able to manage it since then.

However, this summer, I did heroin for the first time. I‚Äôve done it a few times since, and have been introduced to withdraws. Seeing as how I don‚Äôt have access to pills, I buy more heroin when I‚Äôm withdrawing to take away the pain. This prolongs the cycle and has happened probably 5 times since I first bought heroin. Since trying it, it's all that I really want. 

I‚Äôm really teetering on the line right now between functioning and full blown addict. I‚Äôm in a relatively large college in my senior year as a financial consulting major. My grades have begun to suffer at such a crucial point in my life (job search) and I‚Äôm radically depressed right now as I withdraw.

I know the only option is to stop. Are there any rehabilitation services or centers available to someone like me who absolutely cannot reveal to anyone close to them (including parents) that they are addicted to heroin and still attend college class? My ability to pay for this would be limited as my funds are currently still tied to my parents.

If you‚Äôre going to cast judgment, please do not. I have thought long and hard about my mistakes and have beaten myself up enough.

So I have a history with opiods. I am now clean 3 years. The only exception to this is taking opiods prescribed for pain by my dentist and some nucynta for back pain that I've stopped after like 2 doses.

I remember the first time I tried Percocet a 512 Mallinkrodt. I was in school, I was 14 years old. I was in a class about to be dismissed. Some form of English class..

This girl whom was my best friend, I gave her a 522 and I took a 512. We both had empty stomachs that day. 

But my God, both of us felt our ears pop the same exact time, felt the god like euphoria and warmth, we rose are hands so much that day, we we're in absolute bliss. This lasted LONG as well! ( Oxycodone never lasts long )

It was pure ecstasy and joy (one of the reasons I got into oxy was it took my anxiety away and I landed EVERY GIRL, I was unstoppable, I had good grades too)

I felt like I was the BEST VERSION of myself I could absolutely be. Now throughout future use, this stopped happening and I only had euphoria which I loved. After about 1.5 years that stopped. I stopped getting euphoria from oxy at my regular doses from 10-15mgs. Anymore and I would just be nodding.

I stopped taking for another 1.5 years and tried it again, it wasn't like the first time. In fact my body still had a tolerance for it and I just felt euphoria, but it wasn't worth while enough for me to seek the streets for uncut oxy, let alone the price.

**So I finally stopped. My question is, is their a way to permanently stop tolerance? Reduce it. Or will anything ever add to the first experience ever again.**",1542166245.0

A lot of the time, I deal with routine, everyday, mundane maladies. Infections, referrals to specialists, requests for imaging, managing chronic illness. That‚Äôs all necessary and good work. 

But once in a while you have the ability to do something that will *really* make a huge difference to someone‚Äôs life. 

No I didn‚Äôt heroically perform improvised open heart surgery with a pen & stapler on the waiting room floor. 

But I have a patient who suffers from Cystic Fibrosis. A young lad. His parents are unemployed, on benefits and live in housing commission (but are the most loving parents & humble people you‚Äôd ever meet). 

Today, I had the privilege to prescribe this young man a new medication that has recently been subsidised for CF. This will have a profound effect on his quality of life. Hopefully extending his life significantly & allowing him to develop as a normal young man. 

His specialist has asked me to prescribe Orkambi (lumacaftor & ivacaftor). 

His mother was wiping tears from her eyes and I was about ready to burst into tears of happiness as well. 

It‚Äôs recently been subsidised by the government on our PBS (cheap medicines list). Normal cost before listing last month? 

$240,000 a year. For these good people? $6.40 a month.

This is why I got into this gig. Sometimes I forget. 

But no matter what happens for the rest of the day, nothing is gonna remove the spring from my step or the smile from my face.

9wupx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9wupx4/cocaine_question_cause_you_guys_would_know_better/,5,https://redd.it/9wupx4,OpiatedMinds,Cocaine question 'cause you guys would know better than any other subreddit I can think of.,"So this question regards cocaine and potential long-term effects, particularly related to hearing. I tried posting it on r/cocaine but got no answers, to be honest they are kind of snobby snorters and my question is more applicable to IV or smoked cocaine, which many of you folks are familiar with. 

So for people who know what a bellringer is, you know how cocaine can effect hearing. I don't think it is definitively known what causes the tinnitus type effect (I couldn't find any academic information with an internet search)... some people insist it's the surge in blood pressure, I can't find solid evidence of that and I feel like that can't be entirely true because things don't sound different any other time your blood pressure suddenly spikes. I think that just like how all drugs have their own unique effects, for some reason I feel like cocaine causes this audio effect at large doses, either causing it within the brain itself, or physically somewhere within the ear. As a drug that effects neurotransmitters and specific areas of the brain, it sounds more reasonable that it is an effect of the drug on a part of the brain in a neurochemical way rather than a roundabout experience caused by some extreme physical manipulation (in this case cardiovascular response causing a change in perception).

My point is that if the bellringer effect is caused by the drug acting in the brain, no big deal (well... maybe). But if it is doing something in the ear physically through the vascular system, enough to cause that much beloved ringing, that is scary... to me that means it would probably be causing damage. And not like ""oh duh it's a hard drug dumbass, of course it can cause damage"", but more like concern that use could potentially affect hearing (like is the drug ototoxic?).

Me and a close friend binged for a couple of days and got quite a decent amount. Normally we might do a few blasts each, maybe get a little more and do a few more, and that's usually it. This time though we got a couple hundred worth and went to town, took our time and no scary heart worries, but after the long intense session and into the next day my ears felt strange. It was a not uncomfortable, almost pleasant, for lack of a better word ""soft"" muffled feeling in my ears... my hearing seems fine though, and here two days later I still feel it slightly.

I was wondering if anyone here is familiar with this after-effect... this is my first time really experiencing anything regarding my ears besides the tinnitus effect you normally get if you smoke or shoot cocaine... this is an after-effect though, persistent after use and diminishing slowly over a couple days while all other effects from cocaine are perceived to be over.. I'm also wondering if anyone knows if this indicates harm or potential damage. As you might imagine there is a shit-ton of information out there about health effects of cocaine, especially regarding the heart, but not much about hearing. Can anyone shed some light on this for me?

MY GIRLFRIEND JUST SURPRISED ME WITH A COUPLE 2MG HYDROMORPHONE AND I NEVER TRIED EM BEFORE

But yeah we do Boy (heroin) every day she takes like 10% of what I do and we go through half G a week, fent free stuff(tested with strip atleast so mostly) and I was just wondering if we were to insufflate(snort) how much should we do? Plug got locked up so last point of boy anyways so this is perfect. 

I was thinking more around the 4mg range for me and 2mg for her but idk if that would be underwhelming, cause I know oral bioavailability for it is mediocre vs IV or even insufflating at that, so just wondering I guess what would be a good starting dose for someone with a decent opiate tolerance. 

To give you guys a sum of my tolerance, 15mg of oxycodone would make me feel like im gonna throw up and maybe my first time dosing I would throw up (no tolerance) and about now I could take well over 50mg of oxycodone to achieve a semi decent buzz, with no rush no sickness just itchiness and energy. Don't really get a rush from my dope anymore either just keeps me well though im not IVing, and they are the 2mg pills if anyone is wondering. I also am curious how i'd prep for IV.

Skipping past the whole talking about my addiction which obviously got me pissed off, you guys know sometimes you get defensive about your use when people are talking about it/ you, especially considering I‚Äôve been withdrawaling and I was miserable in there. 

So obviously my current medications came up, and my Lorazepam use came up too. My mom knows that when I get them I‚Äôll take like 5-6 each day and run out early, what‚Äôs new. But of course my mom brought it up and the doctor was insinuating, more like straight out saying that I was addicted to them and if I‚Äôm going to stay with her I have to get off it, which PISSED me off. I FINALLY get on a medication that legitimately helps my anxiety, and not even 3 months later it gets fucked up. I don‚Äôt remember if I told you guys, oh yea I did, about how my mom told my doc about how I misuse them and so to be honest, I I don‚Äôt even know if I would even be able to get more Lorazepam with my doctor knowing that anyway, but I‚Äôm pissed that she made it seem like Benzos are the devil and that it‚Äôs completely out of the question for me to be on a Benzo and Bupe together, which, I get, but I have heard of people being on Suboxone and a Benzo together. Also I signed a form saying she can talk to my other doc (Lorazepam etc) doc, so my relapse and everything is going to come up and it‚Äôs just going to be shitty with her, considering she thinks I‚Äôm a little more than two months sober. I don‚Äôt know...

The Zubsolv is 2.9-0.7 so it‚Äôs not a high dose, but my new doc said she would defininitely up me if (I felt) it was necessary. I took 3 of them and I feel mildly opiate/opioid high, so that‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs obviously getting rid of my cravings a bit. So that‚Äôs good, at least I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúwithdrawaly‚Äù anymore, but I‚Äôm definitely annoyed about my legal/ legit Benzo plug to be fucking gone.

(yeah yeah, I know, ""that's not opiates""...)","Hello everyone! Hope you're starting up a good week, that you've got plenty of supplies, and that your dboy is never late.

&#x200B;

I've got a question for the hive-mind here; do any of you have experience with ketamine? (I would ask in other forums, but I trust you guys to be honest with me more than anyone else when it comes to this stuff. There also seems to be a good amount of overlap between the ""opiate"" and ""ketamine"" groups.) I have a consultation with my pain doctor tomorrow to discuss giving ketamine infusions a try. If they go well, it will end up reducing the amount of pain meds I take overall. If it doesn't work on my pain, then there's hope it will work on my PTSD/GAD/treatment resistant depression/Bipolar type 2/etc. (Keep your fingers crossed for me!) Here are the questions that have been popping up in my head;

&#x200B;

1. When you took ketamine, be it for recreational use or medical use, what was your experience? (Bad, good, amazing, horrific, just bleh?) I've read a range of different responses but like I said, I trust you guys to be truthful and honest with me more than I trust other randos online. 
2. If you have taken it, did you experience the ""K-Hole""? This is something I've heard of but never really found a good explanation of.
3. If yours was for medical reasons (mental or physical health) did you get good results from it? How long did results last, and how often did you have to go back for another refresher round?
4. (This is kind of mental health specific) If you've had TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) did you find the ketamine to work differently? Did it work better or worse?
5. How much did it cost you? Did insurance cover part of it, all of it, or did you have to pay it all out of pocket? If you DID have to pay out of pocket, what was your end cost? Did your doctor's office do payment plans? Did insurance cover it without an issue, or did you have to convince them to cover it? I'm finding lots of info saying no insurance covers it for mental health, but some insurance covers it for pain treatment.
6. If you were taking it for medical reasons in a clinical setting, what was your schedule like? I've read that I should expect anything from 5 four hour infusions to ten 2.5 hour treatments over 2 weeks to three 1 hour treatments the first week, 3 the second week, 2 the third week, two the fourth week, and 1 the fifth week with refresher doses given once a month... it just seems like there's a LOT of variety out there and I'd like to hear from some people who have personal experience with it.

(more than anyone before him at least) He's the type of dude that has two different spots, one to sell out of and one to sleep at no one knows where he sleeps. I respect that, he also has a good credit system after you buy from him for a bit. And the best part, 99% of the time he is already at the location.  He explained to me how and why  he does that he told me he never tells you to head somewhere unless he absolutely knows he is gonna get there first he likes to check out the scene and that's where the last one percent comes in because sometimes while checking he'll see something and move it somewhere else. Finally it's a trait lost among all of my dealers but a backbone. If he doesn't like something he will let you know. A good example of this is one time I was at his trap house and a girl showed up well he was play crash bandicoot for PS4 and this girl has the audacity to ask him to hurry up because her child's out in the car. He paused that game right then and there. This is when shit got real, and I knew I was gonna respect him. The first thing he says is ""you bought your baby to a drug deal?"" At this the mom looked disappointed in herself. He goes on to say ""did you leave the car on or is it just out there sitting in a hot car while you come grab heroin?"" At this point I started to get a bit scared for her. Then he goes on to say ""how much you want?"" She finally replies ""just a 20 sac"" and she holds out the money he snatches from her and looks at it with disappointment. Now I was becoming interested in this shit. He weighs out her stuff and continues to ask her questions about her kid like is he well fed? Does he have all the clothes he needs? Throwing slight remarks to remind her he's not totally okay with what's happening such as ""mother of the year"" until he get to the final question ""do you think you have enough diapers to last the week?"" She replies like she didn't even think ""nah but he will be okay"" I've never seen a drug dealer get so angry he full on starts yelling at her about where she is in life as a mother leaving her defenseless baby out in a car in the bad part of town while she goes upstairs to score heroin and buying it with money that could be used to take care of her child. He snatches her bag back away from her, grabs a bunch of h (like a half g) throws it in a bag grabs her money pushes both of them in her chest then says ""shoot this whole fucking bag but before you do buy your fucking kid diapers"". She started to tear up and started to walk to the door when he finally says to her ""don't you ever ever come back up here again and if I find out you spent that twenty on anything other than supplies for your kid, youre fucked"" she starts bawling and runs out the door and I told him how I liked how he handled the situation and that it is fucked up to leave your kid out in the car and shit. He doesn't really say anything after that but sits back down and starts playing crash again and bitching about missing shit. I know this is long but I needed to tell you guys, I've just never had a dealer that kind of cared about, well humanity any other dealer would have just told her to chill with that rushing shit or something I just couldn't believe what unfolded in front of me.

She's the type to dote on people, and being her baby brother, this is no exception. She's taking it personally, I told her it's just probably opiate rage.

I enjoy Oxycodone, sometimes a couple times a week, sometimes a few times a month and at times, rarely. In Sweden people pay up to 55 EUR / 80 mg pill where I live which is absolutely insane and I can't believe they're buying them for such prices. I take no more than 20-30 mg per dose, do people really need something like an entire 80 just to get a buzz? I haven't felt an increase in tolerance myself and I've taken it here and there for a year or longer.

Mostly curious because I know weed users like to go on tolerance breaks, amphetamine users too (even though the tolerance is devilish for recreational use) but rarely hear about opiates. If you're addicted and stick with pills, the price must be unimaginable",1542075753.0

Quickly fell in love. Over the 2 years my tolerance is up so fucking high to get high.... 250mg oxy, costing $150-$250 to get high. 

Luckily, i‚Äôve never experienced harsh withdrawals or dependency, I would space my usage out & always use to get high. 

A couple months ago my grandpa passed, who I lived with all my life and was very close with. I continued using, and I always told myself ‚ÄúI wont ever use oxy to mask the pain.‚Äù but it fucking masked the pain anyway. 

My grandmother hasn‚Äôt been able to pay a lot of her bills and she isn‚Äôt gonna get paid until March. I decided a week ago I needed to stop spending so fucking much on drugs & help her out. So I snorted my last oxys and called it quits. 

This whole week has been me grieving, all of my emotions hitting my full force since all the oxy was masking my emotions. Glad i‚Äôm able to put my foot down before I fall down a deeper hole most people fall down. 

Been having a lot of mental cravings, but no physical problems other than a little back pain. I‚Äôll miss getting high and shit but it‚Äôs just not worth throwing all this money down the drain for like 5 hours of bliss. 

Hopefully I can make it. Thank you guys for all the harm reduction tips & shit all this time.

I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve hit any kind of rock bottom - I have a good job, nice flat, money coming in, great relationships with my folks, lovely partner. My nearest and dearest know about my addiction and I‚Äôm only staying clean for them. But they don‚Äôt feel like enough...which makes me feel like the worlds worst person. 

I‚Äôm not selfish in any other aspect of my life but this. I love my family so why is the thought of hurting them not enough?

Tales of my crazy ex roommate,"Some of you remember tales of my ex roommate, the rapey gross old wife of my old dealer. Well a lot has happened. One of my best friends has beef with her right now lol. The old crone is all out against a girl I dated very briefly and against 1 of my best friends. Mainly bc she is very jealous of other, younger more attractive females. She's truly incredible in how annoying and delusional she is. Her husband deals dope to pay for their habits and whenever he makes a sale she starts bothering him for drugs. It's like a tax. She does boy, girl and Xanax. If she doesnt get what she wants she eithers starts screaming and demanding it or saying him not giving her drugs is abuse and ultimately doing the most loud and infuriatingly fake cry anyone has ever heard. Its so bad. Lately her habits so high he's been cutting his stuff so he can try to keep up w her. It's alienated me to the point I'm going to go through someone else today.

Ok let's play a game. Can you translate any of this? Keep in mind this is incredibly concise and well written for her. Also this person claims to have ""a PhD in being a lawyer"" and ""a perfect IQ"" and her stepfather is the head of the department of defense that has a secret underground base under our state's open air drug market, his dad was the head of ww2 and her biological father was a CIA super agent that invented the microwave oh and yea she was in the cia also from the age of 1 and blah blah blah she's schizophrenic and insane but can't see there is anything wrong with her and think she's the shit (oh yea lately she's been pissing and shitting herself usually laying on the couch bc when my foot was ghastly bad infected she got jealous of the attention I got momentarily and started saying she hurt her foot somehow so rather than hop to the bathroom like I did, which sucked and really hurt but just going where I lay never crossed my mind. She claims they mistake her shit and piss on her, the floor and that poor poor couch for some kind of sacks inside her that burst. Idk. I was there yesterday and literally heard a yelling argument over whether it was her or the dog that shit on the floor. Just think about that. People who think that it's acceptable to argue over whether the shit on the floor is from the badly treated puppy or the crazy woman.) Gawd I didn't mean to write so much and this is just the tip of the shitberg. I could write a whole book about this insanity. I'm just glad I didn't stare too long into the abyss by living around these psychos that I joined them in insanity. 

Anyway, her and my homegirl have been fighting (probably will get physical) and these are texts the crazy bitch sent. Like I said these are easy to understand and well written for her. Later today I will post what the fight is over and translations. I'd so post her face as a prize, she looks insane, but that'd break the rules so that's a no go. All of the spelling errors and everything is copied straight from her phone so I intentionally left them in. Good luck and have fun. 


""Stole my card subsidery melon no limit one of them card gone.im getting restrain order all them cops told P no such thing J my house not P's""

""Stole card deny my life physical thresten foot boke one of them.""


""Fuck I know what the hell I do u wallet ill say I'm u we look alikes""


""Yea childish drama lier sounds right cunt""


Keep in mind that later if you ask her to read what she wrote she can't do it. I always think of Charlie from its always sunny when I see her writing. So do.

Someone surprise the fuck out of us and list a full translation.

Edit: ok my friend lost her wallet and is pretty sure crazy bitch took it.

I. Fucking. Hate. This. Shit.

I am so fucking ball crushingly receptive to this drug.

The prescribed dose of Flexeril is 10mg as needed if Im not mistaken. I take 2.5mg and I turn into a fucking zombie, deep fatigue in my SOUL, yawning over and over, brain running on empty until I sleep.

A full dose will impact me for 72 hours. THREE FULL DAYS. Sleeping and everything. Sleeping AND naps. And every single time I wake up in that awful, awful haze from that evil fucking drug.

The story goes so much deeper than a potent replacement and fundamentally changes the drug game. It started out in strategic organized crime connected cities, tweaked, tested and market studied like a new software product.  Some batches were too strong, some too light, in the early days plain fentanyl was mixed with normal heroin or sold on its own as china-white, now most batches don't have a spec of any natural compounds.  Market forces and human neuro-chemistry spoke over the last few years and something much more sinister is hitting the streets everywhere. Something that makes ""New Jack City"" look like childsplay: Mixed Fentanyl ""Fenta-Dope"".

I am a expert on the subject, but Im not an addiction doctor, drug policist or former parent of an opiate addict - I am a former underground drug chemist and current opiate addict.

To be clear, I never made fentanyl or another other opiate, I had my principles. I made MDMA, lots of it, buckets of it.  I was connected with shady underworld brokers, Chinese labs with moral ambiguity and rouge chemists operating at levels you could not even imagine.  I was mailing and receiving industrial quantities of MDMA, hash, LSD and other compounds 10 years before Silk Road, Bitcoins or the DeepWeb even existed.

After studying every drug synthesis known to man I laid out the ones with opportunity: synthesis for expensive compounds which required new precursors and focused on LSD and MDA/MDMA, perfecting methods of the former that could be produced with no known government watched chemicals and making incremental advances in the mulit-million dollar holy-grail, LSD synthesis or more specifically acquisition of new starting compounds and chemical routes.

At the peak of my work, I saved up a good bit of cash, got an undergraduate chemistry degree, then another in management as an investment into myself.

Through my network I got offers to work for famous mafia's, lucrative crime partnerships and was even asked by a small country to kick start their party tourism industry by moving there and creating high quality mdma.

After a chemical accident which almost killed me as well as ruined a few kilograms of MDMA, I quit. I was covered with chemical burns and filled my apartment block with thick white poisonous smoke.

I left my love behind, chemistry. Its not the thrill of the science or the money or the drugs that hooked me, it is multi-dimensional problem solving, the ancient alchemic feeling of being surrounded with boiling flasks, smoke and poisons knowing you are doing something so much bigger than yourself.  For me, every reward system in my brain lit up, I felt alive. I didn't need sleep, friends or lovers, hours passed without me even thinking of looking at the clock.

Once I left that life behind I felt empty, like a tool without a use - humans are funny in that we are wired to take pleasure in some small act and devote our lives and identity to it - it happens too easily.

This mix of losing what I was best at and having disposable income led me to try opiates, a few traumatic personal experiences led me to become addicted.  When the pills ran out I had to switch to heroin.

This was 2012 or so, a pivotal decade in the opiate industry. Before then, fentanyl was most often made by single, morally ambiguous chemists with access to high quality materials.  This all changed when China got a taste of the money to be made.  Around this time the Deep Web flourished and international connections were made exploiting any financial arbitrage.  The few Chinese labs that made fentanyl were getting hit hard with orders and they realized the demand.  More caught on and the government was slow to react as it was not a local drug problem for them and possibly as revenge for the opium wars.  All kinds of savvy criminals saw the opportunity in importing fentanyl but they did not have the skills to dose it correctly, leading to 'hot-spots' and overdose deaths around the country.  Organized crime took notice and realized that if it was dosed correctly, they could make a huge amount of money swapping expensive heroin supply chains to single electronics sized boxes coming from China.  There was a period where they phased out heroin and phased in fentanyl.  The problem was that the market responded negativly.  People did not like the synthetic feeling of fentanyl, with its lack of euphoria and its tendency to cause breathing problems when that eurphoria was finally reached.

This was the turning point, the Manhattan Project of the drug war.  They realized by mixing various synthetic opiates which now came in over 20 different types, they could mimick the short term rush combined with the long term pleasant high by very specifically combining synthetic opiates with different half-lives.  Now the market made the switch, people who thought they were doing heroin were actually doing a mixture of fentanyl analoges and other synthetic opiates.  The dosing process was perfected and what used to take a small country full of poppy fields could now be shipped into critical markets in a shoebox.  That is the first nuclear level problem, the Chinese were making metric tons of fentanyl with no blowback and import could not be stopped.  A single drug mule swallowing balloons could import enough to feed an entire metropolitans city for a day or two.

This is around the time I quit and got on Suboxone therapy, when it was just plain fentanyl replacing the heroin I would get annoyed with the boring rush and the side effects, having a 50/50 chance of scoring my drug of choice or a cheap, boring replacement.  This brought the cost down to where organized crime became interested in the previously very expensive heroin market, with a dose of synthetic opiates costing orders of magnitudes less the higher up in the supply chain it was purchased.

The second and most insidious problem was the mix, by combining opiates with a variety of half-lives, they created a drug which produced cravings on the 2 hour, 6 hour and 12hour+ time-frames.  The 2 hour fast acting opiates would have you cleaning out your stash and blowing your tolerance through the roof.  The 6 hour mid acting opiates would destroy any hope of quitting cold turkey, providing waves of withdrawl symptoms instead of heroin's very predictable linear withdrawl.  Hunter S. Thompson, a veteran drug user said that his worst withdrawal was by far opium, because opium contains such a large mixture of opiates they combine to crush your spirit and resolve.

The final problem is that these compounds were so strong, that someone who built up to a 100 or 200 dollar a day habit were fucking up their neurotransmitters to a level the medical industry was simply not capable of dealing with.  There are stories of chemists working with exotic fentanyl analougs that achieved tolerances so high they could do enough heroin to kill 15 people and not feel a thing.  Not to mention the Methadone or Suboxone that was meant to replace it during detox.  This also drastically contributed to the overdose problem.  Someone would be used to taking a 40 bag, let their tolerance drop and then immediately overdose taking that same 40 bag again.  Naloxone, the opiate antidote, was almost ineffective, taking a handfull of doses to bring someone back instead of the usual single dose.

These mixes now have a rock solid supply chain, sneaking through international shipping routes mixed with innocuous packages.  Organized crime has perfected the mixes based on feedback from the users and the more pleasurable the high, the worse the detox.

There is nothing law enforcement can do so society must decide how it wants to deal with this problem.  There has been a linear progression from Oxycontin to Heroin to Fentanyl which snuck opiates back into the public eye.  Due to the money to be made in a world where the jobless are so downtrodden, open air drug markets are prevelant and only getting worse.

I wanted to provide some insight into this problem from the eyes of a chemist and the eyes of an addict.  As I write this I am suffering from wave after wave of withdrawal symptom as each different synthetic opiate is leaving my system at a different time.  I relapsed after years away from buying street opiates and am shocked and confused by what I am seeing and experiencing.  This is such a different animal than detoxing from heroin, fentanyl or other opiates that I can already tell the drug underworld will never be the same.  I hope my pain and my experiences can shed some light to those that keep hearing fentanyl in the news but don't understand why.  This is a story about myself, my addiction and my struggle as much as it is about the new drugs of the 21st century.  If this was interesting to you, please leave a comment, I will be reading them between boughts of sweating and puking and they will provide a little light in an otherwise dark time.

&#x200B;

EDIT- Thanks for the feedback guys, I am happy to answer any and all questions that doesn't put me, my past partners or new synthesis routes I developed at risk - this is a great distraction from opiate withdrawal as I have not been able to express the chemistry part of my life to many people, much less the opiate part.

&#x200B;

EDIT2 - Another serious complication of these multi-fent cocktails is that it makes suboxone induction 100x more difficult.  As the first short acting opiate is leaving your system you can easily score 12+ on the COWS chart, enough for sub induction.  The kicker is that even though you are withdrawing pretty badly, the high binding/long half-life opiates in the mix are still attached to your receptors and you will experience PWD when starting subs.  Maybe methadone would be better for this one case but it is an inferior therapy and the dose will be so high.  This is one of the reasons there are so many junkies now and so many relapses that end in death.  You follow all the rules, do a sub induction according to medical literature and you will still feel like death, quickly switching back to a high dose of fentadope which is likely to kill you as it displaces the sub on your receptors like Mr. Steal Yo Bitch and your tolerance is essentially zero depending on how long you allow PWD to last.

&#x200B;

EDIT3:

I wanted to give everyone an update on my detox situation.  When I wrote this article I was in the middle of the worst detox of my life, worse than PWD, worse than anything.  Pure animalistic doom set over my whole body and I didn't sleep for 2 days getting my dose down from 80$ or so a day to 10-20.

I had someone else dose me (smoking) because there is no way I could do it feeling like this.

Once my tolerance stabilized at around 10$ a day, I started taking 2mg suboxone 12hrs after dosing the last dose, then within the hour taking 10$ of fentadope.  Its always a bitch to play this back and forth game but I think it is working.  The tolerance drop helped so much, allowing me to get down to a reasonable level but still have a bit in my system.  The suboxone is working against the fentadope atleast for now, at 2mg it is blocking most of the effects, IE my eyes aren't getting pinned but I don't have that primal anxiety and terror anymore.  I have done this for two days so tomorrow after a small 5$ dose tonight I will take subs without fentadope and try to stabilize on just subs.  I am feeling very hopeful now that I got my insane tolerance down, its amazing how much you can build up just to feel the same effects.  When I was doing 80-100 a day I would wake up every 2 hours with full body anxiety needing to dose, that is the danger of this stuff, because you get WD in a few hours, then again in around 8/12 and it is such a worse feeling than H or pharmaceuticals.  I just knew that I would die from taking so much at night faster than I would from anything else, I would have exactly 2 hour anxiety dreams and wake up soaked with sweat and run to dose.  That is over now hopefully and I am making the transition to subs again.  Breaking out of that window of fast detox anxiety was the hardest withdrawls I ever had, I was literally crying in bed thinking about those I love in my life, shaking and shitting non-stop, even after doing around 30 a day the first day or two.

I will keep you guys updated, I am so happy atleast one person liked this insight.  I know there are some haters who think this is all bullshit but all I can say is that this is a complex world and someone has to do the work in the shadows, and that someone is human with love and worries and anxieties of their own and in a hard time they may choose to talk about it to ease their pain. This work in the shadows is so hard because its life consuming but you can't tell anyone, I think this is why you guys are a good outlet for me, I can be honest about who I am, my demons and darkside, all on the table.

Also, for the haters that think this shit is rocket science and chemists are criminal geniuses who don't read reddit, read Pills of the Gods or whatever about that half braindead nightclub owner who made truckloads of MDMA with no technical background, now put someone with a formal education, a lifetime of technical knowledge and a ravenous curiosity in his place.  Someone who didn't fill his life with dumb swedish models and supercars instead obsessing over the intricacies of some exotic chemical reaction all night.",1542000177.0

Sometime after the kid does his hit and nods out a few times we smoke roach.

It comes out of a crushed matchbox he‚Äôs got in his pocket. Pot resin stains the paper brown and yellow and smells as pungent as weed these days smells. The game has changed. It‚Äôs not like it was when I was in high school. I mean, even after we graduated from the sticks and seeds that came in the grievous bricks of Mexican swag, our ‚Äúhydro‚Äù or ‚ÄúKB‚Äù was nothing like the stuff they‚Äôre smoking these days. Nothing like the stuff the kid has in this roach we‚Äôre smoking. 

I don‚Äôt smoke anyway. Gave it up sometime after I turned 23 and realized that every time I smoked it, I would have panic attacks. Part of that could be attributed to my life and it‚Äôs degeneration into drug addiction, but I have also heard that most people‚Äôs brain chemistry changes in their twenties so that THC doesn‚Äôt do the same things it did for them when they were younger. I believe that. Just a few hits of this thing gets me coughing super hard till its like glass is cutting the back of my throat and the watery snot coming out of my nose burns like fire. Anyway, the kid nods back out, and I turn the TV on. At first it‚Äôs not too weird but as time goes on I can‚Äôt make sense of what‚Äôs going on. Some weird blue fog seems to be rolling out of it while a horrifying and amorphous writhing takes place on the screen. Whatever audio is coming out of it has shifted into strange animal grunts and gurgling, and as the weed hits harder and harder, a general sense of unease takes over. 

I used to have this friend we called Rooster on account of his last name was Gallegos. He used to joke about shooting speedballs in the parking lot of the emergency room in case he overdosed, he could open the door and fall out right there onto the pavement. The idea was that, hopefully, someone would see him dying there and call the staff out to the parking lot to save him. It was a good laugh. He also used to tell me about how he‚Äôd called 911 on several occasions after smoking weed, thinking he was having a heart attack. It was just a panic attack, which is basically what I‚Äôm having now. 

Anxiety is funny. You know? The way it makes no sense for me to be all feeling like the world is going to end and we‚Äôre all going to suffer terribly and die for no good reason that I can think of. In fact, I can‚Äôt think of exactly what unreasonable thing it is that‚Äôs supposed to end the world and kill all of us, but my guts hold the worry and pain of it all. I imagine my guts and the anxiety like a boa constrictor wrapped around the deadly sharp steel of samurai swords, and so I run to the bathroom. I get my altoid can. I pull out a hit and fix there on the toilet. Everything‚Äôs better. The TV is just going to commercial as I walk back into the living room and fall back into the couch. I nod. When the kid wakes up, I‚Äôll have him take me to meet his ex-sister-in-law.

34

The hop has me nodded hard.

Most of the afternoon, I guess, and when I wake up there‚Äôs a kink in my neck. A bad one. It is something I have had to deal with ever since I got a bad chiropractic adjustment. Not by a chiropractor though, and in retrospect, I should have known not to trust the guy as he‚Äôd ripped me off for a hundred dollars just a few weeks before when he sold me eyedrops as LSD. Anyway, my neck has had problems since, and the kid is standing over me pulling on my sleeve and asking for a cigarette. It‚Äôs annoying, but I pull the pack out of my pocket and toss it onto the coffee table. He grabs one out and lights it up. There‚Äôs more daylight out than I expected to see.

‚ÄúHey. What do you think about this?‚Äù

The kid poses in the Captain Morgan stance. His foot rests on the coffee table. The cigarette hangs from his lips and his face is ratcheted to the side like Popeye the Sailor man. He rolls up the leg of his jeans revealing what older generations might call a carbuncle, unsightly and excruciating in its appearance. It is the size of a tangerine and marbled in sickly swirls of infected yellow and a gangrenous purplish black interrupted by pockets of angry red bleeding.

‚ÄúI think you need to go the hospital.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Doesn‚Äôt it hurt?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Looks painful as hell.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúIt is. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve stayed away. I don‚Äôt need some idiot in a white coat stabbing at it and pressing on it and all that crap.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. But you need antibiotics, bro. Otherwise, you might be some idiot with his leg cut off or dead or worse. I promise. I‚Äôll go with you. There‚Äôs a doc in the box not too far from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Really. Let‚Äôs go, after we get out and get the medicine, though, I want you to take me to meet your sister in law or whatever she is. The stripper who buys a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, dude, whatever you want.‚Äù

35

The girl at the front desk requires 400 dollars before she‚Äôll schedule us in.

I pay. It‚Äôs not much to me at this point, but the kid is sitting in the waiting room trying to make the remote work and having this half-hearted conversation with a bald guy about the Mariners. I sit across from them and the bald guy starts trying to tell jokes. They‚Äôre not funny. It‚Äôs a problem this place has seemed to have ever since my dad died. I think he spoiled me. Never met anyone funnier in my whole life. People‚Äôs senses of humor just aren‚Äôt that good, and I can‚Äôt honestly say I remember them ever being better than they are now. This city got less funny when my dad left them. That‚Äôs a fact, but it‚Äôs not really even that they‚Äôre particularly unfunny. It‚Äôs the way they try to be funny. A lot of laughing at their own jokes. Deliveries are too put on and unnatural. Whatever, though. It‚Äôs just how it is anymore. Makes me miss my dad today listening to this guy try to tell me a joke, and the kid is not even paying attention. He‚Äôs just moving that remote through the air and standing on the chairs and staring at the TV up on the wall. It isn‚Äôt working. 

‚ÄúHere. Let me try.‚Äù I say. The waiting room is small and to my left another man sits with his lower lip hanging off his face like a piece of busted rubber or something. Every bit of his gums and teeth is exposed. A strand of drool hangs from his mouth and drips onto his shirt, and the man is breathing hard. I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs farted or if it‚Äôs just his breath that stinks so bad. 

The bald man has been called back. He limps away. I get the remote and make it work on my first try. The kid throws his hands up. 

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWisdom comes with age, my friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, whatever. Let me try again.‚Äù

He snatches the remote from me and tries. It still doesn‚Äôt work.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name anyway?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúCharlie, bro. You know that.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should. We went to the same NA meeting for a year or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue. Guess I was in my old world. Thanks, though, for inviting me to that game.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem. Say you think I‚Äôm gonna be okay?‚Äù There is a genuine fear in his eyes. 

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lose my leg.‚Äù

A fat nurse steps out into the lobby. She holds a clipboard and stares at it. ‚ÄúCharles Pulaski!‚Äù She screams out. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù He stands up and turns back to me. ‚ÄúYou coming?‚Äù

I stand up and walk with him to the exam room. It is cold and bathed in sterile white light. Scents of bleach and other astringent cleaners float in the air. He sits on the table, and after a minute, the doctor comes in. 

The doctor is nice enough. He makes appropriate small talk and doesn‚Äôt sneer in disgust at the sight of the abscess on the kid‚Äôs leg but instead shows compassion and orders a shot of lidocaine to be administered before he lances and drains the infection. Charlie cries in pain until he passes out. When it‚Äôs over he wakes up and we walk out as the daylight drifts into night with a prescription for Amoxicillin. I take him to fill it and back to my apartment where I hook him up with another shot to sleep it off. He calls his sister in law and sets up an appointment with me. She works south of the city at the Heathens‚Äô Den. I leave him sleeping on the couch and catch a cab to meet her. ",1541976152.0

While in MD I developed an Oxycodone addiction lasting almost a year and in the last 5-6 months I was spending 700 a day between my girl and I to stay good. After we ran through 60k in about a year and running out of savings, we decided to switch to h. Being from Baltimore I knew all the spots and if I didn‚Äôt I could call my mother to help me. Honestly there was so much dope on every corner it‚Äôs like a heroin wonderland. Points usually went from 5-10$ and a bun/g would be around 80. 

  This lasted about a month before I od off of a fent Oxy 30 and decide I wanted to move. Plus we couldn‚Äôt afford where we were staying anymore because because of our addictions. So we set out to the south because I have family down here and rent is very cheap compared to MD. After being clean for a month I relapsed when I met up with an old friend I knew down here. He helped me score some H and it was expensive and shitty, I went through my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù a few more times until people of this sub told me my friend had been stealing from my bags. Something I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed because I started on pills and only did h for about a month. 

  I stopped fucking with him because he was pinching my bags after I would take him to get his own shit and I‚Äôd throw him 20 for helping me. Well I haven‚Äôt touched H in over 3 months but I haven‚Äôt been sober either, I‚Äôve been keeping okay with the special tea that can‚Äôt be named here.  Last night I was fiending and I started to think about the one or 2 times my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù had used my phone months ago to text his plug. I found a single text of a McDonald‚Äôs order and I remembered taking the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù to McDonald‚Äôs to get his plug food. So I texted the number and within 30 minutes the dude replies, and it‚Äôs def the plug. 

  I be straight with the plug about who I am(never met him cause the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù didn‚Äôt want me to meet him) and who I know him through. He asks me what happened to the friend and I tell him that I stopped fucking with him cause he was a shit middle and pinched my bags that I got from him. Told him the ‚Äúfriend‚Äù said the plug didn‚Äôt want new customers and basically all the bullshit he‚Äôs done. Out of nowhere the plug tells me the the dude owes him a lot of money and ask me what he‚Äôs been up to so I tell him. Plug gets mad that dude was buying weed through me and hitting me up for bars while he owed the plug money.

I'm the weird type of user who can handle withdrawls. It's uncomfortable, I puke, and I feel feverish but I don't feel like I am dying. I just feel like I have the flu. Well, I had been off everything for 5 days when I started to get sicker. This is unusual for me, so I went to the hospital. 6 hours later, I am admitted with 2mg dilaudid IV every 4 hours. Apparently I had a UTI that i was unaware of and went untreated to the point of it getting in my blood. Like most OP-heads, I know what to say and not to say to get decent meds in hospital, but I didn't do any of that this time. I legit thought I was just sick and figured I would be home that day so I just told them what was up with me. Of course the pain numbers were dialed up but hey, thats the game. So here I sit on day 3. Probably going to be here 3-4 more, if not more. Every 4 hours I get off to the shotgun to the face. I have never been an IV user in the street life, so this blows my head off every time. I have a pack of flushes here if the nurse is ""one of those"" who let the iv drip push it in. Every single time, Kaboom. Just wanted to share my joy with you fine people.

All you have to do is mix up that little bit of nothing and put it in one syringe (I usually use about 20-30cc) then you're gonna want to load up your cottons and use another syringe to apply water to the Cotton's, mix them bitchs up all nice and good.

My girlfriend is an active heroin addict, I didn't know this at first but she wants to get clean and has struggled. I think she needs inpatient detox and rehab... but no insurance and detox is expensive and she doesn't want to go to a state run facility again. I think she now shoots $60-$100 a day worth, used to be a lot more.

She tried a few weeks ago to taper with subs but lasted like 2 days. She took 8mg the first day and was still miserable, 2nd day same and I thought it was too much, all while taking a bunch of xanax (also way too much imo). She definitely also has a problem with xanax but claims to never get WDs from it. 

I went ahead and ordered some meds online to have for whenever she is ready to try again.

Got more than enough of:

.1mg clonidine

40mg ondaneston (for nausea)

.25mg Ropinirole (aka requip for RLS)

800mg gabapentin

She can get subs.

Basically looking for advice on a dosage/taper schedule for subs, and I'm thinking quicker is better.  Was thinking to start this on a Friday so the worst is on the weekend and she can maybe be functional enough to go to work on Monday.

Also wondering about dosage of clonidine and ropinirole (requip), was thinking .1mg clonidine 2x a day and .25mg ropinirole 2x a day. Though I've read things about titrating ropinirole upwards. I think I would have to dispense her these as I don't trust her not to just pop a dangerous amount of clonidine.

Loperamide? Dosage? I never messed with it.

A stranger might hand me a grease stained box half filled with some unidentifiable sludge and a chunk of what was alleged to be chicken breast, or I might beat out the last bit of my peach yogurt onto my blackened palm before licking it up unashamed and starving for passersby to see.

Other times I had spells of de ja vu like I had seen these very same things in the same order in a dream a long time ago, or maybe it was the effect of living the same reality over and over again as the universe exploded out of nothing and created everything before it imploded in on itself and did it again.

One time I sat back after dinner in a soup kitchen, and tears streamed down the faces of two girls singing worship songs at the homeless shelter. They sang, ‚ÄúYou give and take away. You give and take away.‚Äù The theology struck me as odd, but I appreciated the passion before their friend came out to give his testimony of being a depressed teenager who found life and joy in Jesus Christ. I thought that sounded nice but didn‚Äôt apply to me. There were holes in my arms that had to be filled, and I regarded nothing as sacred.

And another time I met a 54-year-old woman named Donna squatting against the wall next to me out of the rain and smoking a cigarette. She wore funeral parlor perfume that seemed to be mingled with the aromas of mental illness and mildew. Her mascara ran in the rain, and flecks of red lipstick stuck to her teeth. She bit her cigarette. She punched me in the shoulder. She pointed her finger.

‚ÄúLook at that!‚Äù A dramatic scene unfolded 60 feet from where we crouched. EMTs rolled a blue lipped and grey faced person in a gurney out of Fred Meyer‚Äôs and into the back of the ambulance. I couldn‚Äôt tell if the person was a man or a woman. I just knew they were ugly.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúJerianne. I guess she‚Äôs not coming back to the apartment with me this afternoon. Bahaha. Screwed it up? Didn‚Äôt ya, Jerianne? She always does!‚Äù She threw the rest of her cigarette into a puddle. ‚ÄúYou wanna come home with me?‚Äù

We walked west a few blocks and took a left up a steep hill to her apartment where she told me about how perverted the attendant at the corner gas station was and then let me crawl all over her in the dark. Afterwards we smoked cigarettes and talked in bed.

‚ÄúMy son died 4 years ago in a car accident on the coast in Washington. He was everything to me. He was all I had. I tried to kill myself last month with my methadone and colonopin but it didn‚Äôt work. I took my whole month‚Äôs worth of methadone and my colonopin too, but I woke up in the morning. The doctors filled my scripts again but now I have to take classes three days a week for the nine more months, and I still wish I was dead.‚Äù

That‚Äôs life though. One morning you‚Äôre on your knees kissing your pregnant wife‚Äôs belly and buying diapers and rolling out pink paint on the walls of the room with the crib for the baby girl you‚Äôll be bringing home any day now, but the next morning you‚Äôre on your knees in a hospital waiting room clutching your face and screaming with blood on your shirt and trying to understand why. It happens. People lose their most precious relationships in an instant, and there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it but die themselves. She chose a slow death and hurt all along the way.

We rented movies from the library and watched them over and over without ever knowing what they were about, because we snored through them. Anything filmed in the early 90s invoked strong feelings for me, because they were from when I was a kid, before the hatred consummated within. I dreamed of living the life of one of the unnamed extras and disappearing into the fictitious background of Lethal Weapon 2 or Backdraft where life was of no consequence and Michael Jordan was winning championships in Chicago. It was not uncommon for her to wake up with large holes burnt into her sheets from nodding out with lit cigarettes.

‚ÄúDid I set my bed on fire last night? I think I remember that! Haha! Yeah. Now I remember. I woke up and the sheets were on fire. There was a fire last night! Yup. Sure was. Jeesh! You‚Äôd think that I‚Äôd remember something like that. Haha! Almost burned myself up in a fire and the whole building too. Haha!‚Äù

In the daytime, she helped me boost merchandise from stores, but I was good at it even without her. I strategized to either be in and out as quickly as possible, or if I thought a secret shopper was following me, I would walk from one side of the store up an aisle back to the other side, and down another aisle, and back up it. If anyone followed me for all of that, I would ask him why he was following me. They never knew what to say. If they were on the phone, I would ask them to say hello to their mothers for me. If they were in the health food section, I asked what a tub of lard like them was doing buying raw organic almonds. Sometimes, I would fill a hand basket and get their attention by walking toward the door and drop it, right before I walked out. Then, while they put the items back or talked to each other about it in the room full of monitors, I would walk back through the store and steal what I wanted. Donna kept lookout, and I filled my bags with DVDs and walked out with my arms full of merchandise and the alarms going off.

She kicked me out one morning after I got high and slept on the couch. A few days after that I got high on meth and texted her from under a dumpster about her naked 54-year-old body and what I wanted to do it. She forwarded the explicit messages along with her own haranguing texts to my mother every day for weeks. My mom told me that Donna sent 28 texts before noon on a Tuesday, and none of them made any sense.

In late May I found a cup of cold coffee in a trashcan and threw it on her downtown. She called the cops and tried to tell them I was a thief, which they already knew but couldn‚Äôt take me to jail on. It was in Pioneer Square where I used to sit and wait for licks or plant my feet in one spot with straight legs and fold at the waist like a taco trying to touch my nose to my big toe and drooling. People always stopped and woke me up to ask if I was okay or if I needed some help, but I was doing great.

I moved for work after that and came the city to pick up from this girl I met. Her name was Breezy, and it was good to have a steady hook up even if it meant riding the bus two hours out to he place and two hours back to where I slept every night. I did day labor and slept under the awning of a nail salon across the street. At four I woke up to catch rides with the crew out to the landfill where we worked. The guy who drove had the aura of a potato. He wore a leather jacket. He drove a truck. He grew a bushy beard. He mumbled something about alimony payments and a daughter on our cigarette break once, but when I pictured him going home to his sad life, he was a potato, a soft, lumpy potato crying on his pillow. After a few weeks, the company fired me for stealing other people‚Äôs lunches and sleeping in the bushes while on the clock, but I tried to make life in Vancouver work anyway. I didn‚Äôt give up until the incident in which a local army veteran paid me five dollars and a 99-cent cheeseburger to deposit a certain bodily fluid on a lacy pair of panties in a graveyard. Then I moved back to the city.

On a Saturday night, a stumbling and drunk Mexican flashed the money in his wallet at me by Voodoo doughnuts. He wanted me to be his date or sex or something, but it ended up that he spent about five minutes licking the side of my face while I got his wallet out of his back pocket and took the money. It was a 200-dollar come up, and I skipped around town until I pulled my money out to buy crack from a big group of black men in China town. They jumped me badly and robbed me.

As Sunday morning broke the splatter of cold rain on the sidewalk soaked into my newspaper blankets under a Chinatown stoop. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, and the loss of the 200 dollars was my only thought. My leg and hip hurt from getting jumped. It had been such a happy moment to have that money in my pocket for the morning, but I called Breezy anyway and appealed to her compassion. She told me to come see her in an apartment downtown where she was getting tattooed.

In the room, Breezy and her 19 year old girlfriend laid face down to get lace tattooed down the back of their legs. It was an ordeal, and they squirmed and squealed. The lady whose place it was kept talking to her dead girlfriend like she was floating in the room with us, and their tattoo artist asked if he should start a mobile tattoo business even though it was illegal. Breezy gave me a hit to hold me over, and we hung out for a while before I left.

I bought from her a lot, because she was reliable and always holding and generous. She fronted or gave me dope, because she liked me. It wasn‚Äôt long after we met that I came to see her at her hotel room to find her jerking around her room collecting some belongings in a bag and sweating in a curly blonde wig.

‚ÄúHere you go. Can you watch my place for me? Some f***ing scumbag tried to rob me earlier. I need someone here if he tries to come back.‚Äù She handed me a few chunks of heroin and meth. Maybe she had reason to think the place was about to get raided and wouldn‚Äôt mind if I took the fall.

‚ÄúYeah, I can watch the place.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, but I trust you. I‚Äôll be back tomorrow.‚Äù Her girlfriend wasn‚Äôt around. She was with a guy, and they took off in a truck. Later, she used this incident to make me feel special and said,

‚ÄúYou are special. I never trust people like that, but I knew you were different from the start.‚Äù

It took her a day or so to come back, and we got close when she did. Breezy chased her 19-year-old girlfriend off for being paranoid and jealous, before she moved on to the next fling. I texted Danielle back in Cincinatti even though she was with another guy, and I complained about my heartache to Breezy. Breezy asked me if I thought she liked to hear about Danielle.

Breezy would finally fall asleep at around 4 a.m. Sometimes earlier, but when she was out she could not be woken up. Slapping her didn‚Äôt work. Screaming was useless. We never tried pouring cold water, but it seemed doubtful that it would make any difference. It was a problem, because people wanted to buy 24/7. Most nights before she fell asleep she would send me and whoever was around with money for cigarettes, scratch tickets, grape red vines, fun dip, sour patch explodes, donuts and apple fritters which were her favorite. She filled the grape licorice with the sugar from the fun dip and handed them out like the loaded syringes she handed out earlier in the day. Then she would pass out and wake up in the morning raging and throwing things.

She gave me five balloons of heroine one morning and sent me to sell them downtown, but before I took off with my bag and a long board Breezy pulled out a huge bottle of random pills from which I took three. I had not slept or eaten in days, and she sent me off ten minutes later with a sweaty peck on the cheek and aggravated by how badly I was slurring my words.

At the Nordstram Rack I packed as many bottles of cologne into my black book bag and some fabric grocery bags I had, even though I could see stout men with earpieces watching me through the glass doors. It was the 4th time I had been there to rob the place of cologne in 2 weeks, and it was also obvious that the men were part of a sting operation set up to stop me. I kept going anyway and juggled the 5 heroine balloons in my mouth with my tongue on the way out. As soon as the door opened, a voice screamed,

‚ÄúSTOP RIGHT THERE!!!!‚Äù

I bolted down the street after a woman scratched my neck, and I punched her. She chased me and screamed for someone to stop me. A man with long hair grabbed my backpack, and 3 yellow balloons fell out of my mouth and onto the sidewalk. I broke free and skated to some festival at the park by the river. There were cops looking for me, so I took off my hat and jacket, hid the skateboard under a bridge and walked around talking to strangers. Cop cars drove by every 30 seconds looking for someone but never stopped me.

Later I did the two balloons I had in my mouth, and after a few hours I went to see if the other balloons were still on the ground. They were, and I sold one and did the rest of them under a bridge as night fell, because I wasn‚Äôt going back to the hotel. I told Breezy that I messed it all up when she called, and she cried,

‚ÄúCome back. I don‚Äôt care. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me. I want you back here. You are too important to me.‚Äù

The days at Breezy‚Äôs went by hot and slow. It was June, and it seemed like everyone was in and out all day everyday. We never had time together, and I could tell she wanted to get me alone. The place finally cleared out one afternoon, and I said,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving, too,‚Äù to scavenge for something to trade her for more drugs.

‚ÄúWhy would you leave now? Huh? Everyone finally left us alone and now you want to leave? What‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù Desperation and hurt squeezed through her voice box from across the room.

‚ÄúOh. I didn‚Äôt know you wanted me to stay.‚Äù I knew she wanted to have sex with me, and I felt the same, mostly from the drugs and the weird bio chemical things that happen when a boy and girl spend too much time together. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, then.‚Äù She put her legs up on the table, and we both grimaced at a bad smell in the room.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take a shower.‚Äù

She told everyone about it. Her friend, Gay Kevin, told me she said it was the best she had in a long time, and I was proud of myself. But as the days continued the meth overrode the heroin, and I never slept except the time she made me and I spilled water all over her in the bed. She laughed about it and changed the sheets, but she could be really mean too, like when I repeated myself.

‚ÄúYeah, I know, Riley. You already said that. Try saying something different. I‚Äôm tired of hearing the same old s*** from you all the time.‚Äù But, she was kind to me about the water I spilled on her. When I needed a haircut, she sat me down in the kitchen and cut it. She did a good job, too. I kept shaved for her because that‚Äôs what she liked.

‚ÄúThanks for the hit, baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúRiley?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, baby?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me baby. That‚Äôs not my f***ing name!‚Äù I pretended I never heard it and referred to her as babes within a half hour.

I stalked up and down the road in the June sun, Quasimodo‚Äôs skeleton sweating and scheming all day, marching back and forth to the department store. Someone told me shooting up in the thin veins in my wrists was the most likely place to kill me with a clot. I didn‚Äôt know if it was true, but I shot up there just in case. Everyone told me the same thing, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a gun, Riley. Armed robbery is not worth it.‚Äù But it was more about putting a bullet in the ceiling, jumping onto the counter and screaming for everyone to get on the ground. It was my new obsession but no one would give me a gun. I fantasized armed robbery in Breezy‚Äôs kitchen and sweated listening for cars through the blinds.

She punched me in the face one night for trying to defend myself against some grievance one of her ex-girlfriends had against me. It was getting more and more difficult to be there, and it seemed like she hated me. One night she had sex with several guys right in front of me and wouldn‚Äôt even look at me when I talked to her afterwards. I kept trying to get her attention, but Gay Kevin said,

‚ÄúLet it alone. She don‚Äôt want to talk to you right now.‚Äù He knew her better than I did, but I tried to grab her bags of meth and heroine to insult her. She hid the dope under her butt and told me to leave. As I made my way towards the door, one of the guys she slept with screamed obscenities and threats of stabbing me from the bathroom.

I‚Äôve always heard that Roosevelt said, ‚ÄúSpeak softly and carry a big stick.‚Äù I ran my mouth and when that didn‚Äôt work I used whatever I could to impose my will and destroy things. In this case it happened to be the wooden bat she kept by the door. I jumped over the bed and almost kicked the pocket door down before I pulled him out by his hair and drove the bat like a splitting maul to his head. It connected on the side of his skull behind his ear. He crumpled to the ground.

Breezy jumped onto my back, so I reached behind her head and hooked her armpit to body slam her onto the floor. She gasped as the wind knocked out of her. Gay Kevin charged me but bounced off me and went to the ground like an empty Styrofoam cup in the wind, and we spent the next few minutes in a tornado of random objects flying around the room. I launched Breezy backwards through the air with my legs. The blinds came down with her, and she moaned like she might be seriously hurt. The men shook in fear as I backed towards the door and grabbed a sleeping back on my way out. My stay there was up, and the cops were coming.

In a room of what were supposed to be hardened criminals, violent types, people to be feared I was the only one living up to my persona and the things I said. Everyone bluffed and lied about the danger they presented, but like a poker game I laid down four aces almost every time the chips were on the table. They all had nothing in their hands, and you can‚Äôt win with nothing when your bluff is called. It wasn‚Äôt that I was tough or bad. If anything I was a coward and selfish and stupid most of all, but I had soaked up everything I ever saw or heard since I was little like a sponge. I adapted and thrived in any environment that didn‚Äôt kill me. My environments were criminal and my life was violent, so that‚Äôs what I was good at.

The sirens wailed in the distance. There was a boarded up strip club a block away where I hid in the bushes behind it with my sleeping bag. I went back into town the next morning and never saw Breezy again.

I was arrested in September for three felonies that could easily put me behind bars for the rest of my golden years of life. I was given a consent decree luckily to remove all my charges if I finish this treatment plus one year probation. My cravings have been through the rough lately and I will be discharged successfully in one month. I still want to use even though knowing it will bring back all these charges and put me in prison. I don't even know what to do at this point it's just a constant battle in my head of me just rationalizing using on probation and trying to be sneaky and get away with it and the other side genuinely wanting a sober, successful life. Fuck all this shit I wish I could go back and punch my doctor in the fucking face.

Months later, when confessing my addiction to my Mother, she told me she knew all about it and showed me a packet with a load of oxys and some tramadol. Turns out I ordered it to my parents house rather than my flat... under my sisters name. (I was high, who knows what was going through my head lol). 

Anyway it's been a months and she keeps it by her bedside tucked down. I often wonder if she even remembers she still has it, or if she knows I might know where she keeps it and is leaving it there as a test. It's not the kind of thing my parents would do but I can't rule that out. I'm now living back home so it's so hard to get my hands on anything, especially as I have only just found another job and therefore have no money at the moment. 

How could I get them back without revealing that I took them? Like I thought I might wait until they tidy their room then check the bins (I'm sure they'd throw it away if they realised they still had them and had no ulterior motive to keeping them), but turns out they're in no hurry to tidy their room. I'm paranoid that they'll notice if I take them, but at the same time, do I care? If I deny it, they can't prove it. It's been so long and I just want something to take the edge off.

I was considering just a series of posts in these subreddits, which would be okay I suppose.

Next though, considered I should spin up a blog (hosting and such will be free) and chronicle the experience on a separate blog. This way if someone lands there they can easily search and look thru all articles.

""THE SCORE""

It's 6am and all I can think about is scoring heroin...I'm not sure how I ended up in this situation, wait....that's a lie. I know exactly how this escalated to black tar. I followed that curious cat down the wrong alley, tripped, slipped and fell nose first into a pile of brown powder...well,fuck me....let's get this show on the road.

&nbsp;

630 am ""maybe he's awake, should I try calling?"" 

&nbsp;


 I mean, the sun is almost up and he MIGHT be up....That's the logic of an addict, I know damn well he won't be awake for at least 4 more hours..and that's still not likely, my call log is more like a continual spiral into drug craving madness.

&nbsp;

While my cravings are completely mental, that voice in my head just won't shut the fuck up...That gorilla on my back weighs 800 lbs and he's a mean fucker when he doesn't get his way. He's a master manipulator and will speak to you smoother than a seasoned pimp mackin to a fresh bitch on the track. He's taken up residence on my left shoulder, like a belligerent squatter refusing to leave. At times he's calm and smooth and can give me all the right answers when I need to make excuses about my drug use and where all the money I've made is......but he's Bi-polar as a muthafucka. In a flash he can transform into the raving uncontrollable beast that brings me into the abyss of self destruction..

&nbsp;

For the past 3 days he's been on a rampage, he knows my drug break is up...he was on a warpath until I tricked him back into his cage.

&nbsp;

 About 3 weeks ago I told my dealer to cut me off...this was after several scary black outs at home, my girlfriend definitely knew I was fucked up on something.... Xanax and heroin can throw you into a helluva stupor...if you are reading this you have either been in one or have seen someone in one. This is the walking zombie syndrome, when the nod takes over and you fall asleep standing up...mid speech...in the middle of the he meal..it doesn't matter, you will only know it's hit you when you snap out of it.

&nbsp;


Like an extra in ""the walking dead"" your body is there but your mind and soul are ultimately gone

This is known as the ""dope fiend lean "" and it defies all logic of balance, some people will be full on touching their toes while nodding out while standing...others turn into bobblehead dolls and their heads just dangle about. I was the walking dead...slamming into walls, almost crashing through the shower doors and shattering them in the bathroom. .. I snapped a chair in half after collapsing into it...it was pretty scary that she saw and heard me like that. If she catches me I'll lose her...there's no coming back from ""oh yeah by the way I got a small problem, it's heroin but I promise to stop""

&nbsp;

Knowing damn well I wouldnt...

""THE ANTICIPATION ON PLEASURE OR PAIN IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE REALITY OF IT""

&nbsp;

As I sit here thinking that the high I'm chasing is some fantastic orgasmic feeling of pure euphoria, it's not...and it hasn't been for a long time. I use alone so the social aspect is gone, and having to hide the habit and the high is getting to be too much. How the fuck am I supposed to enjoy myself when I have to hide it?

&nbsp;

The answer....a drug vacation day. I put in an order for 5 grams of black tar, knowing that the chances are slim of this happening the way I am planning it. Called in sick to work to score heroin and get high....Yeah I'm sick alright..sick in the fucking head. One day this whole shit show will be exposed to the world and they will know my secret. While I clean up nice and can play  chameleon on most situations to blend in, I'm sure everyone I know has caught me in a nod once...and I've been able to blame my insomnia for most of it.

See, I've battled insomnia ever since my last long term relationship...and it was with that bitch Crystal. See, before brown sugar was my sweetener of choice I dabbled into the world of high grade stimulants. Beautiful shards of all shapes and sizes were crushed and sniffed or smoked. My girlfriend at the time liked it, and I was trying to play it cool and party with her even though it wasn't my thing.

See, the stint I served in the Amphetamine Penitentiary was during a different era, we didn't have the quality these tweekers have...our shit was just that, shit.

&nbsp;

 Crank was a filthy predecessor of crystal meth around the 90s, but it was what we had. Rose, Peanut butter, and others dirty white powders were the flavors available. We didn't have these magnificent  shards of glass that looked like they were stolen from a chandelier...we had shit that tasted like it was made in a motel bathroom. You could see the pink from the benadryl they were using...sometimes the dope would still be wet. Leave a line of this stuff on a CD case too long and it would seemingly begin to eat away at the plastic ...and we happily snorted this shit by the boatload with no concern.

&nbsp;

I didn't enjoy smokin meth because it never really got me high like everyone said...until one day. I was renting a room in these shitty apartments by the freeway, most are occupied by section 8'ers or dopefiends...I ended up with a section 8 dopefiend, such a winning combo

I was green to crystal meth and the glass pipe wasn't my specialty, she would fire it up and tell me when to hit it...and after a few hits I got the hit that changed my life.

&nbsp;

""Whoa....so THAT is what everyone is talking about!!!!"" as I feel a tingle just flow through my body like a low voltage electric buzz...we smoked more and fucked like rabbits until the next day. I was selling crystal at the time and had around an ounce or so usually with me at any time....until I broke the commandment of ""never eating high on your own supply""
Little did she know I was barely sleeping 3 hours a night after that, and was smokin my way into meth psychosis.  I was able to hide it well enough, but what happened was just more of us using together. She wasn't hooked but liked to party...so I played along. While we'd get high on the weekend together...

&nbsp;

""First me and Crystal on saw each other on the weekends,

But now Im hiding my tweekin

 and seeking her out everyday in between em""

And that's how I ended up on meth for about a year or so.

I sit here at Ocean Beach and watch the waves roll in and outt... pop another xanax to hopefully calm the beast....and wait.
I picked up some good weed from the club to try and calm King Kong down for awhile. They called the stuff Gorilla Glue,ho fitting,hopefully it will do the trick... the names of weed nowadays is pretty interesting...hopefully this glue will keep my mind stuck on something other than heroin.

&nbsp;

As I smoke my joint and watch the waves flow, I feel the warmth of the sun on my face and for a split second I forget all about dope and just enjoy the view..the weed elevates my mood for the moment and I'm at piece...

&nbsp;

I look down at the halfway burned  joint and mumble to myself ""this shit is the bomb"" I drift off into a dreamy haze with the sound of the ocean and seagulls. For a brief moment I forget about heroin and fall into the comfortable bliss of the xanax and weed...it's such a beautiful day, I remember so many good times here. My car engine still running, I pass out and let time fly.....worry free 

And then the beast jolts me from my slumber....fuck, did I miss his call? How long have I been asleep....? FUCK!

It's now 1130 am....is he awake yet?  By my logic it should be a decent time to try and call someone...or maybe not? I dialed his number and listen.....one ring....2 rings, 3 rings..

&nbsp;

The 4th ring means he not answering and inside I pray he answers.

""YEAH...what's up? ""   

Why does he bother asking this?

You know what the fuck is up, I need to get high because I sure the fuck didn't call to say good morning, make small talk, and discuss the weather. 

&nbsp;

""It's all good but you gotta wait until around 3 to get it""

A four hour wait for heroin feels like 12 hours in my mind, but what can I do? I make sure to remind him I need 5 grams, because he'll forget and only have 2 to spare. He sounds annoyed but at this point I don't give a fuck, I want my dope....

&nbsp;

It could be worse, I could be left to scouring the streets of the Tenderloin and taking my chances with strangers hopin for a friendly face....which is an endless roulette wheel of possible rip offs. I should be thankful that I have a direct phone number to the devil himself and he answers my calls for the most part.

&nbsp;

How can so much emotion and joy be created by this small ball of black goop. This sticky tar has so much power to be just an inanimate object..once it touches you, there are thousands of unseen teeth that sink deep into your soul. 
Heroin has no soul, but it can permeate yours and cause it to disintegrate rapidly and causes necrosis of the soul. When Im high, nothing matters...I am numb to the world and my mind is no longer racing with madness.

&nbsp;


I enjoy the bliss off slipping in and out of a conscious reality and into my personal dreamland. In a nod..a single thought manifests into a  detailed dream, each new nod takes me down another rabbit hole in my twisted mind. But the true bliss is the complete numbness to anxiety, worry, stress and fear..

&nbsp;

It's funny how this can ease the pain on life in an instant. The most stressful day is instantly relieved once that double wrapped plastic package is secured. After 3 days of a drought and no connections, today felt like fucking Christmas and Junkie Jesus smiled upon me. 5 grams of tar and I'll get through another couple of days before the carousel begins again.

&nbsp;



The cycle of addiction is hard to break when the monkey lives on your shoulder and is constantly whispering sweet nothings in your ear....life itself doesn't feel the same without hop and I hate that my peace of mind and happiness is routinely based on copping. I try and pass the time by reading stories on r/opiates to help me realized I could be in a much worse situation..

&nbsp;

I could be using dirty toilet water to try and get a hit from old cottons, or I could be puking my guys out and I fully blown withdrawal shitting on myself in a SRO in the TL. I'm not trying  to say my struggle is worse than anyone elses, because I know it isnt...but it is still a struggle for me mentally and controls me more than I would like it to..and this is just my story.

&nbsp;

36 phonecalls in a single day to the same number are a clear sign of a problem, and I sit here and wonder how much of a dopefiend he sees me as. See, my dealer is also one of my best friends....while dope brought us together, we formed a bond and treat each other like real family..a twisted misfit bunch of dysfunctional addicts. We don't just meet up for transactions, we actually hang out and have a friendship..

&nbsp;

This friendship of course gets rough when the main dope man aint around, he can't cop, meaning I can't either and it turns into phone tag and text relays.

&nbsp;

Yeah, I could hit 16th or head over to the TL and try and cold cop....but I got a family, a job, and a lot to lose if I were to get busted. My boy Irish aka Big Rich was my sidekick in the L's, he knw every spot, every dealer and could get us some action within few blocks of browsing.. Rich died alone in an alley in the Central Valley during a relapse and overdosed. Xanax and Heroin killed my boy.

And that's the same combination in my system now.....I pray for the strength to break free from this. I've done it before, it can be done again.

&nbsp;


Until that day comes, I'll live this life day by day....praying for the courage to face life without the need to escape reality, but to face it head first without a crutch.

There is something in life I have yet to discover that will mean more to me than getting high...I struggle daily to find and accept this, and pray for the epiphany that will save my life in the long run.

&nbsp;

Until then I'm taking my spare change, tossing it into my pill bottle with some mannitol and a chunk of black tar and drift off into my personal land of peace....without worry, anxiety or the ability to give a fuck for a few moments of incoherent bliss...

&nbsp;

May God grant me another day of life and allow me to wake up from my self inflicted euphoria....

Thank you for reading.....you are not alone..

I've had experience with oral oxy and a few other prescription opiates before, mostly prior to getting into down but dillies seemed to elude me. I was able to get 6x 8mg and gave em a try... I figured I wouldn't need all of them to get a buzz but after banging the lot, I didn't notice a rush and seemed only to get well slightly. 

I should clarify and add that I've been on subs for a couple weeks, micro dosing up to a stable dose but was only at about 6mg suboxone at the time. I've felt as though subs are able to block opiates at a low dosage for me in the past, but am a bit surprised at the fact I wasn't shaken by 48mg hydro and another gram of dope after that. Certainly I've been trying to make moves into getting off street opiates, hence the subs, but am unsure whether this is more of a tolerance issue, suboxone doing its job occupying receptors, or a combination of the two. At any rate, it was humbling and disappointing to see that I am unable to get a good buzz anymore -- and clear as day that I have to work on my cravings for that.",1541888508.0

I am sure by the title you can see I need some advice and I want to say off the hop I know you guys are most definitely not doctors.

Anywho, 12 days ago I finally made the trip to the methadone clinic that I had been putting off and procrastinating on for months due to the fact I felt I was not ready to quit despite the fact I knew it was best and it was what I wanted. The doctor started me off at 30 mg which just made me feel good for a few hours but I'd wake up in withdrawal.

So from there he bumped me up to 45 mg and same deal but also when I started on 45 mg, I was unable to keep food in my stomach which I reported to the doctor and he says he thinks it's just early on set of withdrawal between doses and bumps me up to 55 mg.

So here I am at 55 mg (day 4 I believe on 55mg) and I'm still experiencing this issue where I am unable to keep any real food in my stomach.... I say real food because I have no issues with candy, chips, or high sugar cereals but any actual meals I end up throwing up. The problem here is that I am also super hungry but when I eat I throw up and get hungry again an hour or so later since the food ends up coming back up. So far I have tried waiting certain amounts of times after taking my dose and also taking my dose as late as possible, when I do this I end up puking up the dinner I had earlier and then getting hungry a little bit later but since I know I'm going to throw it back up I do not bother to eat.

As of late I have basically been surviving off of candy, popsicles, and high sugar cereals have any of you also run in to this issue? If so how did you fix it? And if there's no one who has also had this issue do any of you have any ideas or things I could try? I just want to eat normal food and stay on the methadone program/stay clean. Any and all advice would be appreciated guys!  Thank you in advance.

This shit never gets easier. I don't even have enough fingers to count how many people I've lost to this shit. I'm fucking 18 years old and most of them are around my age as well. This shit shouldn't be happening. But it is. Please if you're new to opiates, run fast and get away while you can. To even think about the fact that I started doing heroin when I was 14 is just ridiculous, I wish I never thought I was grown at that age.",1541832653.0

I've known him since he got to Colorado, before he started selling. Today when I went to pick up, I remarked on how much I've been spending in the last week (I hate the holidays, but they're great when you're busking.), and we started talking about how on the one hand (the homie side) he was a little worried because my habit has pretty much doubled in the last two weeks. He wanted to know if I've been alright in my headspace and so on. But on the other hand (the dealer side) he was going (his words) ""CHA-CHING. *appropriate arm motion* Of course I love that you're coming to pick up twice a day now."" 

Anybody else have moments like this? Either as a customer or a dealer? How do you keep those side separate if you do (as a dealer)? As a customer do you appreciate it or no? It'd be like if back in the day Amy Winehouse told you you might want to slow it down. (Sidebar: I'd've fuckin' loved to have done dope with Amy Winehouse.)",1541831895.0

I‚Äôm happy to say I found an alternative to buying shit off of the street and found a nice cheap high quality Kratom vendor instead.

I shouldn't be picking up anymore, but I cant help myself from chasing the damned dragon. I ""have"" the money for it, sure it's an hour drive but it's the best bang for my buck given the quantity and the quality. I made my piles of money, enough to pay the 2 loans, enough for the 2 buns, gotta get my cigs and of course the gas $ to get me there & back. It's already in my head so I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Ring. Ring. Ring. Ring. ""Im sorry the person you are trying to reach does not have a mail box set up yet. goodbye"" 

Fuuuccckkkk. 

Why do I always take my last shot BEFORE I make sure he is around. Should have waited. But he is always around. I'm sure I'll get a text in 2 hours saying ""come thru"" but at that point I wont wanna drive. 

Instead I just got my cigs and a tub of ice cream. Time to sulk in bed with a fatty ass bowl of ice cream to sooth my troubles. Maybe tomorrow I'll resist, just smoke a bunch of pot instead and prepare for the worst within the next few days. Meh, I'll probably still go pick up. Unless I am wise, scrape 1/2 the bags to make it thru tmrw. Scrape other half on Sunday. Use cottons on Monday AM and begin count down to take sub & go thru WDs. Ughhhh. Wds makes me wish I was in that Adam sandler movie where he used the remote .... I'd love to fast forward thru that. Thanks for reading, just needed to rant.

I havent posted in a while cause i got off the dope and got on subs almost 3 months ago. Ive had a couple one day relapses but mostly been good. 

Basically yesterday morning i took around 2mg of subs and later that night i ended up railing a fent pressed oxy that i came across. To my surprise I got pretty high from it. Does fent break through subs more easily than say dope or other opiates?

I already know that. I am as safe and sterile as possible, I'd just like to know how to do this the right way.

So - I have some morphine powder that I occasionally inject (I mostly snort it). The 2 first times I shot up I didnt cook it in the spoon at all, but I did of course filter it. But it took about 5 minutes for it to kick in. After that I started cooking it, and then it only took about 1-2 minutes to feel the effects. So my question is, is it even supposed to be cooked? If so, do I actually boil it, or just like I've been doing - heating it up to that point right before it's boiling? Am I doing something wrong? How do you guys do it?",1541819602.0
