I ended up nailing the interview and I start the job on Friday!!!

I can't sleep and my fucking legs feel like they're on fire. I can't get my hands on NOTHING right now... I tried to get some Valium just to knock me out, and I can't even get those. So I bought a box of co-codamol from the pharmacy, and attempted my first water extraction

They're 8mg/500mg.

This is what I did: 

1. Crushed up 50 co-codamol pills (480mg codeine) 

2. Mixed it with w/ water

3. Left it in the freezer for 20 minutes

4. Now (and this is on-going), I'm filtering it using a couple layers of tissue. 

I've changed the tissue several times and I don't see any trace of paracetamol on the tissue, even when squeezed.

The liquid is clear, it looks exactly like water. In fact, I'm going to upload a picture now before posting this thread.

But yeah... stupid question, from a guy who's on the verge of jumping out of a window, and pictures, I don't know if they're gonna help at all but really ANY advice right now would be helpful.

If I fuck this up, I'm taking 25000mg of paracetamol, which, safe to say, I don't want... Although I don't think it'd make me feel any worse than I feel right now.

http://imgur.com/a/0XwnY

Here's an album.

Top pic is the actual extraction so (I'm hoping) pure codeine, the second... well, what's hopefully filtering the paracetamol out, and the bottom is the co-codamol. 

Again, stupid question but I'm kinda desperate and when I first started Opiates, I always got pure codeine, never this shit chemists put in to fuck with you so I've never done a CWE.

I'm not doing this to get high. Hell, 480mg codeine ""high"" I wish I was that lucky. I'm a dope addict, and like I said, I can't get anything until tonight at 10pm, and it's currently 3pm and I just can't go the whole day like this. ",1464788356.0

Deeply depressed and honestly a little scared.","Okay, so here's the thing: I'm a dope addict (shocker, I know) and I really want to get clean (so original!) Okay, so now that I've said it as simply as I can, I'm doing that whole ""starting to get better, but self sabotaging at the same time"" dance we all know so well. I'm the father to a beautiful little girl that'll be here in October, and I will break down and hit rehab if I have to. I want to be clean for my daughter. 

I come from a good family, poor and enjoy a good a buzz on a roxy or two, but good none the less. My father was addicted to the criminally over-prescribed medicines he used to receive for Degenerative Disk Disease. He has since quit the every-day-dosing, but will still take pain pills if he can find them. The point I'm making, is that dad is a raging-turned-recreational addict. Mom decided that a good way for she and I to bond was to start snorting Oxy with me at 15. I'm 22 now, and I'm addicted to heroin. It can happen to anyone. I always thought growing up that heroin addicts were the dudes who lived under the bridge. But the opioid epidemic starts in regular working-class living rooms.

I have cut back significantly; when my fiancé took the test and handed it to me to read, I took that as a sign to straighten up. I did stay (mostly) clean for just under three months. When I say mostly, I mean once or twice a week, mostly suboxone the rest of the time. I did some damage prior to my fiancé going from my best friend/ex-roommate to the person I'm going to marry and finding out about the baby. I have left mine and my father's life buried in a mountain of debt just large enough that it's scary. I was never taught to cope with anything other than substance abuse. So now, I'm about two weeks into another relapse and sleepless nights with RLS. Not to mention another two week binge that took place about a month ago. People offer free dope for driving services and such, it's not hard to get even when I don't have cash.

I do have one important asset: my wonderful, supportive, understanding, fiercely loyal fiancé. We were near-inseparable best friends since we met a year ago. She was even my roommate, crashing on my couch for a while. She moved out, and one night I finally worked up the courage to kiss her. And it worked. I am convinced I have found my soul mate. She fits every awkward nook and cranny that comprises my anatomy perfectly, and I her. She is the most incredible thing I've ever had the pleasure to acquaint myself with. Even better than my dream girl. Our relationship is near-perfect. It's effortless, and beautiful, and I've never known unconditional love until I met those hazel eyes. She has watched me shoot up, snort, withdrawal, tossing and turning keeping her awake, steal, lie, smooth over, cry, beg for help from my family, and she has held my hand through every step of the way and hasn't faltered one time in helping me to recover with love. She is the light of my life, and the person I will see every morning until I'm an old man.

I could opine further on my love for daughter, but I think you can tell where that would go. Sorry for the long ass post. It's 4:00 in the morning, I just woke up from two hours of sleep over the last 36. Stress will keep you going. And a lot of dope, because I just can't stay door well. I have to keep slipping up, and I don't know why. I always feel guilty after I get high. Which is a normal response for some, I suppose. I'm sure you guys will rip me a new asshole for posting such a sappy sob story, but it's late and I'm deeply morose. I want to be better already. I wanna wake up tomorrow not sick, not craving, maybe smoke a little herb, and just be happy with my family. I hate myself.

Recipe:

1lb poppy seed, (Unwashed)

500 mL water

Empty 2L soda bottle

Directions:

Put seeds in bottle. Add water. Shake vigourously for 6-7 minutes. Screw cap a bit so only water gets out. Empty water from bottle. Water should be a brown color. If it's white, you left it in for too long, if it's clear/mostly clear, then your seeds have been washed too well.

I drank 100 mL of my brown liquid and I feel so good. It's been a while since I had a real opiate (I use kratom on the reg, but stopped a few days before this tea). I believe the main chemical in the tea is morphine. It's very good! 9/10!

It would be 10/10, but the taste is just HORRIBLE! Oh yeah, your brown liquid should be very bitter! The good alkaloids are bitter. Think a CWE. Lmao. My girlfriend had a smaller dose, ~75 mL of brown liquid. She's not feeling it as much, but I have no idea why. Have a great night y'all. :)

I say this because he uses too (which doesn't help) and he's beaten me before several times. And by beaten I don't mean like just took cash and ran, I mean handed me bags that had cinimom or some shit in them. Shit that's made my nose bleed to fuck.

But out of desperation I decided to take a chance on him for the 100th time. 

First off the amount of $$$ that was asked for was crazy, 10 a bag and I only had 70. Through desperation I still did that.

Then he finally gets here. I hop in hand him the cash and he hands me the shit. I wasn't gonna let this mofo fuck me over again so I said ""You don't mind if I test it do you?"". He said nah so I pulled out my straw and sniffed a bag off my phone. Sure enough it was dope so I said your good and then he dropped me off. 

Got home and these bags were SMALL AF. They were good but their was barley shit in them.

I still had a nice night of being high though, even though now I'm not high and pissed I blew through 7 in one night cause 2 fat good bags can have me nice for awhile.

Anyways just thought I'd share my experience, also have an interview set up and an uncle of mine might give me his car, so Mabye I can try this cold copping thing in the future.

My fave Summer activities are going to the waterpark, chilling by the lake and bodyboarding in the ocean, all of which will be infinitely cooler on opiates.  This is the first Summer I've actually had the dough and connections to stay high consistently so forgive my enthusiasm.

What's in your Summer stash?  What activities do you have planned for the next 3 months?  ",1464737855.0
4ly25a,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4ly25a/bag_to_water_ratio/,5,https://redd.it/4ly25a,TheRealGeigers,Bag to water ratio?,"To explain a little more, do I need to add more water for, lets just say a 6 bag shot versus a 2 bag shot?

For example, when i do a 1-2 bag shot I only give it about 10-15 units of water, but if im doing anything higher I do about 20-25 units. 

The reason I'm asking is because I just did a 5 bag shot with around 25 units of water yet it didn't really feel like it was that big of a rush compared to the 3 bag shot I did earlier in the day with only 15 units. 

Sorry if this seems completely dumb but I'm semi-salty about having used more bags yet not a better high. 

Edit: forget about trying to get that rush though, does it matter how many units of water I use if I use more bags or hypothetically could I use 20 units for like 10 bags?",1464735296.0

I was cleaning up my room when i stumbled upon an old drug bag and in it was some white morphine pills with 200 stamped on them that i had bought a couple years ago and only used once. 

What im thinking these are are 200mg extended release morphine tabs. Now they are about 2 years old but havent left the bottle since i bought them but id be worried if the extended release mechanics in the pill might have worn away.

What im wondering is what danger id be in taking one of these? Last time i did i just remember it made me feel goofy and sleepy but id be worried about old pills breaking down too fast and killing me lol.

4lxn99,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4lxn99/first_time_iv/,6,https://redd.it/4lxn99,agatpom,First time IV,"So today, finally, all my IV supplies arrived and I took my first shot of heroin, after about three weeks of snorting. Three observations:

1. The rush is not quite as good as I was expecting, but that's probably because I was overly careful with the dosage. And I shall proceed to be for as along as I can.

2. The whole procedure is a lot trickier than it looks. I guess it takes practice, but tying the tourniquet and precisely manipulating the syringe is not as easy as I thought.

3. Finding a vein is easy for me (for now), but hitting it is difficult. I can see them, I can feel them with my fingertips, but it still took me six tries to pull *anything* other than air and thank fuck it was dark red blood.

Despite this being quite the dark and sad moment in my life, I can't help but feel a little bit excited. And scared. And high.

There isn't really any point to this post, so let's make it slightly useful: When I dissolved the heroin 3, I just used water and citric acid, no heat. The water turned brownish and there were some tiny bits floating in it. I assume the particles were the substance used to lace the drug and not undissolved heroin, right? Also there was almost no blood oozing from the injection site after injecting. When I get blood sample taken by a doctor I usually have to hold my arm for like five minutes, here I just wiped away some blood and it sealed. Is it because of the smaller needle or did I somehow massively destroy my vein?

EDIT: Observation 4: Now I have a bunch of needle marks on my arm, except for the one that hit the vein. That one is a barely visible tiny red dot.",1464730105.0

So, I od'd on my normal dose of 2 of the OC 80's and 2 blue 30's with 4-6mg of Xanax. I woke up surrounded by paramedics and told them where all my pills were so they could be destroyed. I was done. 

Well, the rehab I chose to go to suggested that I detox first, so I went to a little detox facility in Texas. During intake they asked what all I was on and how much. I told them the truth that I was taking 560 mgs of Oxy and around 10-12 mg Xanax daily on top of 60 mg adderrall every morning. 

After a couple days of just being totally disoriented and really not knowing what was going on I started to have unreal hallucinations. I was absolutely certain they were never letting me out and had vivid dreams where I was having tracking devices inserted in my body at night to make sure I couldn't escape. I actually started telling my mom they were putting things in my butt at night. I was fucking terrified of this super nice man that worked there because I saw him in my dreams and he was the one that would give me a shot to knock me up at night. 

The doors to each two person room were these heavy steel monsters that slammed uncomfortably loud, and they droned on and on all night keeping me awake. Well, on day three or so I fell out in a seizure in the lunch line. When I fell I landed face first and knocked out my front teeth. The next day I had another seizure while they were checking my blood pressure. They sent me to some hospital where I was diagnosed with having some thing where you give yourself seizure from being super stressed out or some bullshit similar. 

My mom got online and found that benzo withdrawal causes seizures. She called them back and asked what they were giving me to keep me from dying of cold turkey stopping of benzos, and they had literally fucking forgot I told them I was on Xanax. They started giving me 1 mg footballs every four hours or so and I was instantly back to normal. 

I nearly died because this detox facility just read that I was on opiates and I'm guessing they stopped reading and totally missed my massive benzo addiction. So, I always tell people to make damn sure it's known if you go anywhere with a benzo addiction, or they could mistakenly kill you. 

This is the first time I've told this story, and it feels good to tell all you wonderful people. ",1464879026.0

id love to give this a shot after one of my runs. but im scared of wasting my money for a pile if red crap thats useless to me.

if i had my way, id do things like this. pick up my next script of subs, and get a g or 2. do all my dope, get on kratom during wd, hopefully make it through acute withdrawal, taper the kratom off. from this point id try to abstain for a month so that im not physically dependent anymore. get some naltexone and try out ULDN to see if i could keep my habit under .2 shots at a time when i do use.

I do however feel like there even is some glorification in the dark side of opiate addiction. There seems to be something mysterious, wild, and beautiful about the life opiate addiction causes.

Prior to that it was a half gram or less a day insuffulated for about 4 months. Before that, approx 5 years of hydrocodone abuse, starting at 10-15mg a few times a day and growing to, on average, 200mg a day up to to the point I started snorting dope. 

Now I feel I need to stop for at least a month to hopefully lower my tolerance at least somewhat for at least some short amount of time... I DO plan to start back up. I have no delusions of quitting permanently nor do I even really want to. I just want to enjoy the shit again, rather than it being a part of my daily routine to survive such as eating. Aside from a day or two here and there, 3 max, where I couldn't find or afford drugs, I've quite literally basically done opiates every day for the last almost 6 years. 

My goal after this clean out is to, obviously do less, but also to have a day or two in between days I use. I'd really like to maybe not so much go back to recreational use.. but at least drift just some small amount back that direction on the scale, away from full blown addiction which is where I am at currently. Which I know that's kind of a stupid way to put it. I know I'm an addict, I'm always going to be an addict... I just don't know of a better way to word that  I want to be a little more functional than I currently am. I haven't lost my job or family yet.. but it's fucking close if I don't get a small handle on it. 

Anyway all of that is really irrelevant... I just wanted to give some background on my usage and kinda, idk brag (for lack of a better term) at what my goal is for this clean up.

The *REAL* reason for this post is to ask a question... I have 3 8mg Subutex tablets and I few 5mg Valium (not sure on exact number, but I have a good bit and absolutely no benzo tolerance) With my habit being what it is, will breaking those subs into 2mg fourths to somewhat lessen WD and using the Valium to combat RLS and help sleep, should that be enough to at least get me thru the first 4 days? I only plan to use the pieces of sub when it's really really bad and only use two pieces a day. I also have a small amount of kratom (maybe 3 or 4 doses) and I can usually get thru a shitty but not horrible day with a good dose of kratom in the morning and evening. 

I know everyone is different and all of that but on average do you guys think with the small supply of stuff I have coupled with fairly decent willpower that I can at least get through the brunt of the WD process? Also, I am 6ft tall, 163lbs, work a labor intensive job 40+ hrs a week, and also have access to about 20 or 30 1mg alprazolam should I need them. Oh and a bottle of lope too, which I've used in the past to help with WDs. 

Any other suggestions I'd be open to listening. Thanks r/opiates I still have half a gram to finish tomorrow before I start the cleanse using sub pieces after WDs have fully set in and I'm already ready for this month to be over lol

An old friend who uses reached out to me today and we reconnected.  So he's always been a shooter and offered to help me with my first time doing it.
I don't plan on ever doing this again. In fact, i have an appointment with a sub doctor next week so this is really my last little run. If I don't quit, my SO will probably leave me. Anyways, I digress.
He says he can come over to me in about an hour or so and show me the ropes/do it for me. I'm nervous. Since I have an incredibly high tolerance after 2 years of usage, how much is a safe amount to start with? And odds are, I'll be okay? Right?

I do oxy (60-120mg) twice a week, cutting back from every other day. Ive noticed as of recently the past month or so, the 3 days spaced between dosages helps to keep my tolerance around the same area, but I get withdrawals like I was using every day. I slowed down from every day to every other to twice a week, yet the symptoms just get worse.

 On top of falling into some hard times, I decided I need to take a break from this wonderful drug, in order to get my finances and my health back in check. I had 2 Roxy 30s and 2 OP 40s left. I decided I would wait to do them, a treat for myself when I finished this endeavor. 

Now to the good news! My normal supplier hit me up, he gets scripted quite a bit, but has run out early (what a surprise) and he was owed 30 blues and this bitch burned him and wont return phone calls. He asked me last night if I had any left, and if I could front him some till Friday, if a deal Thursday didn't work out. He offered to double my mg I fronted. He always hooks it up, I often save some that I buy for when he needs them in a month to have some in his piss for his UA, or he is sick. He will always hook me up with more than I buy, plus sometimes a better price, and throw me extras like Valium, xanax, soma, and sometimes lyrica and klonopin. Not to mention when Im over there he will often give me a nice fat line of a few blues. 

Well I ended up fronting him the 2 blues and 2 40s. He is going to hook it up 10 blues, plus give me a fatass line, and a few goodies. He is goingto buy some on Thursday but isn't 100% if they will come through or not, and if not he will have them Friday. Sounds like Friday is the perfect day to end my tolerance break!

If i stop and dont do anything else after today that leaves me roughly 4 days of clean time...will the alprazolam and the hydromorphone be out of my system by the 7th? Also should I expect them to drug test me on my orientation? They didnt test my girlfriend on her orientation they just set up her probation. And everyone keeps telling me that certo (surejell) works to help pass drug tests but it seems like bullshit to me...and others are telling me to dilute my piss and add color with b vitamins so they cant tell that its diluted but, im nervous to fuck with my piss at all.

If they decide to test me the first day of pti on my orientation i really dont want to fail...i know that they pretty much expect you to fail your first drug test and i could probably get away with it but its going look bad.

Except my parents are starting to think something is up with me. Apparently the way I’m acting is fishy.  I’m really good at hiding my use otherwise; there is no way they’d find out.

My county has a pretty big drug issue being so that were located only about an hour away from a major dope city. 

So I try using my junkie senses to scan for people that are high and or look like they use (dickesh I know). First one was a lady he had it all. Pinned pupils, skinny, and a car that just screamed I use all my money for dope (pretty judgmental but I had to go with it)

Went up to her and asked if I knew her she said no then I kinda just felt dumb so I walked away.

Second comes and this dude was high as fuck I could just tell. I ask him if I knew him and he said nah. Then I said I think you sold me some shit before and he was like nah I don't do that. I told him I was looking and he kind of gives me the look then proceeds to say whatcha want. I didn't want to come right out and just be like heroin please but I gave him the look and I said you know. He was about to ask directly what I wanted them he kind of shyed off. He got in his car said I can't help you and dipped.

3rd and last was probably the most hopeful. Dude and his wife get out of the car with NA tags hanging from the rear view. Nearly shat my self and said this is my chance. Since  they might've been in recovery I treated lightly and asked if they go to NA. They said yeah and I said how long you been clean, the answer was ""awhile"" so I took that as ""we still getting high"". They asked if I went I said I should prob be there right now and they asked if I was looking, after that he took my number and said if I ever needed a ride to a meeting hit him up. So I gues it turns out they're clean.

I want to discuss the merits of kratom here and what everyone else thinks of it or what your experiences are. I'm a 6 year, on and off opiate abuser - ultimately when things get bad I'm shooting speedballs for a few days, stopping, suffering, and repeating the cycle until I either have no more money or my life becomes totally unmanageable. However, I've IVed hydromorphone for months (ran out of that source), sniffed oxycodone, smoked fentanyl, snorted U-47700, drank PST, and other stuff - no amateur in the opiate world really.

I've been taking about 15 gram gelcapped doses of kratom every day for a few months now, somewhat successfully, and it seems to do be doing the trick; allows me to be semi-functional without requiring total abstinence.

I find that kratom does for me what an e-cigarette does: it provides a low-moderate buzz that is nowhere near as enjoyable as the real thing but somehow manages to satiate the urge that I have to use heroin. I take my kratom, get a nice buzz, think to myself ""man, I wish I could do some heroin... but eh, this is good enough"" and repeat the process.

I currently have on hand some lactulose (which I have been taking for the past 2 days) and some duolax - which I hope to use only as a last resort. So, my question is, what would be the best way to go about this now? should I just take the laxative now or continue with the lactulose + keeping hydrated.

So thank you all, this sub made me feel significantly less alone and less like I was going completely insane in my situation. Your sense of community is phenomenal, so much so that I felt the need to set up a Reddit account just to join you all.

Also, I'm finally to the point in withdrawals where the AC stopped hurting my skin and I can sleep for more than 2 hours at a time. ",1465035083.0

Is that possible?","Hey guys, title says it all. I have a buddy who is very experienced with opes and makes them sound like heaven and hell. As a drug nerd, I am very interested in trying hydros for my first time. I want your honest opinion on this; am I a dumbass for even considering this, or is it truly possible to indulge sparingly? 

Some background info about me. For 3 years I was addicted to cigarettes before I switched to vaping  (now down to 1mg/mL nicotine concentration juice; a very low nic solution), and I was mentally ""addicted"" to smoking cannabis daily for a period of a month after about 4 years of on and off smoking. Both addictions are now under control, and the only drugs I regularly indulge in now are nicotine from my vaporizer and caffeine (cut down from 8-12 cups of black coffee a day to 1 cup/1 energy drink in the morning). I occasionally consume alcohol (never an addict), and less occasionally consume psychedelics, my new favorite being 1p-LSD. My take-away from this is that I can fall in love with a drug relatively easily, but I feel I have enough self control to remove or significantly reduce substances from my life if they appear to cause issues. 

Are opiates a whole new level of addiction potential, or is it possible to indulge fairly infrequently without fiending for more?

Thank you all for any insights you can give, and please be as harsh as you need to be if you feel this is a bad idea.

 Much love!",1465021269.0

Sorry if I'm in the wrong sub. /r/drugs is awfully special bunch apparently. 


I'm looking to jump off at 1/4 gram of ECP. My other withdrawls have been from PST. I don't think I can survive another withdrawal if it's as bad as kicking that shit.


How would you kick the habit if you had everything at your disposal?


I would think:

Subs: 8MG for 1 day

4MG for 1 days

2MG for 2 days

1MG for 4 days

.5MG for 4 days

.25MG for 4 days

And then jump off. So sub taper for two weeks. That seems too long.


While doing the sub taper also taking 10 grams of kratom twice a day.


Roughly 4 grams of xanax daily for sleep.


Clonodine as needed for cold sweats (the 150 MG pills).


Is Gabapentin  (Lyrica) at all helpfull? I've never taken it. 


Does anyone have any experience with Agmatine Sulfate (sp)? 


Would it help to take a weaker opiate like hydros or tram before kicking?

1.  **Don’t try to convince the officer of your innocence**. It’s useless. He or she only needs “probable cause” to believe you have committed a crime in order to arrest you. He does not decide your guilt and he actually doesn’t care if you are innocent or not. It is the job of the judge or jury to free you if he is wrong. If you feel that urge to convince him he’s made a mistake, remember the overwhelming probability that instead you will say at least one thing that will hurt your case, perhaps even fatally. It is smarter to save your defense for your lawyer.

2.   **Don’t run**. It’s highly unlikely a suspect could outrun ten radio cars converging on a block in mere seconds. I saw a case where a passenger being driven home by a drunk friend bolted and ran. Why? It was the driver they wanted, and she needlessly risked injury in a forceful arrest. Even worse, the police might have suspected she ran because she had a gun, perhaps making them too quick to draw their own firearms. Most police will just arrest a runner, but there are some who will be mad they had to work so hard and injure the suspect unnecessarily.

3.    **Keep quiet**. My hardest cases to defend are those where the suspect got very talkative. Incredibly, many will start babbling without the police having asked a single question. My most vivid memory of this problem was the armed robbery suspect who blurted to police: “How could the guy identify me? The robber was wearing masks.” To which the police smiled and responded, “Oh? Were they?” Judges and juries will discount or ignore what a suspect says that helps him, but give great weight to anything that seems to hurt him. In 24 years of criminal practice, ***I could count on one hand the number of times a suspect was released because of what he told the police after they arrested him***.

4.    **Don’t give permission to search anywhere**. If they ask, it probably means they don’t believe they have the right to search and need your consent. If you are ordered to hand over your keys, state loudly “You do NOT have my permission to search.” If bystanders hear you, whatever they find may be excluded from evidence later. This is also a good reason not to talk, even if it seems all is lost when they find something incriminating.

5.    If the police are searching your car or home, **don’t look at the places you wish they wouldn’t search**. Don’t react to the search at all, and especially not to questions like “Who does this belong to?”

6.    **Don’t resist arrest**. ***Above all***, **do not push the police or try to swat their hands away**. That would be assaulting an officer and any slight injury to them will turn your minor misdemeanor arrest into a felony. A petty shoplifter can wind up going to state prison that way. Resisting arrest (such as pulling away) is merely a misdemeanor and often the police do not even charge that offense. Obviously, striking an officer can result in serious injury to you as well.

7.    **Try to resist the temptation to mouth off** at the police, even if you have been wrongly arrested. Police have a lot of discretion in what charges are brought. They can change a misdemeanor to a felony, add charges, or even take the trouble to talk directly to the prosecutor and urge him to go hard on you. On the other hand, I have seen a client who was friendly to the police and talked sports and such on the way to the station. They gave him a break. Notice he did not talk about his case, however.

8.   **Do not believe what the police tell you in order to get you to talk**. The law permits them to lie to a suspect in order to get him to make admissions. For example, they will separate two friends who have been arrested and tell the first one that the second one squealed on him. The first one then squeals on the second, though in truth the second one never said anything. An even more common example is telling a suspect that if he talks to the police, “it will go easier”. Well, that’s sort of true. It will be much easier... *for the police to prove their case*. I can’t remember too many cases where the prosecutor gave the defendant an easier deal because he waived his right to silence and confessed.

9.    **If at home, do not invite the police inside, nor should you “step outside”**. If the police believe you have committed a felony, they usually need an arrest warrant to go into your home to arrest you. If they ask you to “step outside”, you will have solved that problem for them. The correct responses are: “I am comfortable talking right here.”, “No, you may not come in.”, or “Do you have a warrant to enter or to arrest me in my home?” I am not suggesting that you run. In fact, that is the best way to ensure the harshest punishment later on. But you may not find it so convenient to be arrested Friday night when all the courts and law offices are closed. With an attorney, you can perhaps surrender after bail arrangements are made and spend NO time in custody while your case is pending.

10.    **If you are arrested outside your home, do not accept any offers to let you go inside to get dressed, change, get a jacket, call your wife, or any other reason**. The police will of course escort you inside and then search everywhere they please, again without a warrant. Likewise decline offers to secure your car safely.

4mln6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4mln6d/questions_about_tolerance_and_withdrawal/,3,https://redd.it/4mln6d,tolerancewithdrawal,Questions about tolerance and withdrawal,"Hi folks.

I'll try to make this short.  I'm in my early 30's now, first got into heroin when I was 20.  Only smoking, never IV.  Spent a lot of time off and on until about 25, then almost always clean.  I remember the first time I got into it, I smoked around 5 grams over a month, quit cold turkey, and the withdrawals were a nightmare.  After several years I got pretty good at using for a few days, then quitting long enough to prevent withdrawals from going too apeshit.  But I was also going pretty hard when I was on it.  Minimum a quarter of a gram a day, most I can remember was half a gram over about 2 hours.  Lots of dope.  Also used to love smoking it while peaking on MDMA, found that was about the closest I could get to the feeling of that first hit...  that's not related to anything tho, just a happy memory :)

So recently I started up again.  Hadn't had any opiates in 7 years.  I got a quarter gram thinking it'd last me a few days for sure.  But even after all that time off dope, I managed to finish it in the first day.  By the 3rd day I was up to half a gram a day again...

So my question is: is this normal?  Is dope tolerance a thing that stays with a person forever?  For anyone who might say ""maybe it was shitty dope"", you'll have to trust me when I say it definitely wasn't.

Also, unrelated, but sort of related:  I'm sure this is very subjective, but are withdrawals worse when you do a lot of dope in a short period of time, or a little dope over a long period?  Suppose I have a quarter ounce, would I feel worse if I smoke half a gram a day for 2 weeks, or a quarter gram a day for 4 weeks?

You go too early, you're the latter - just some dude robbing a pharmacy.

I don't know if he simply lost his mind or if it's a side effect of being off opiates after 20 years of abusing his prescription meds or opiates in general, but it's terrifying and I have the feeling he may have suicidal thoughts too. He acts like this emo tormented 15 year old emo kid when he's actually a grown-ass 39 year old man.

Thi is coming from a newer IV addict; new as in only been doing it in the vein daily for a quarter to about a half of a year year, but still not having fun when WDs come.

1) How does a vein stop working?

2) When does it come back, if at all?

On a side note, hydrocodone seems to work best for me.  Oxy, morphine, worked little better than ibuprofen.  I guess they both mellowed me and helped me deal with pain that way but as far as direct analgesia, they were very lacking.

4mrvin,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4mrvin/second_time_mild_od/,20,https://redd.it/4mrvin,agatpom,"Second time ""mild"" OD","Hi, guys, it's me, your favorite self destructive noob. Tonight I managed to finally feel a vein in my arm. Big one too, so I decided not to waste any time and proceeded to give myself 20 seconds of the greatest high yet, followed by an hour of trying to keep myself awake and breathing. 

This was not the first time I OD'd either. I managed to snort my way into hospital two weeks ago, so I feel like comparing these two horrible experiences.

First of all, neither of them were life threatening, I just needed to wait it out. No Narcan was necessary.

The first overdose, from snorting: It's hard to say how much I took, but it was quite a lot more than I usually do and after I was done, I just lay down and passed out. It happened at around 1 AM and I slept until 6 AM. The moment I woke up, I realized that I can't hear properly. I went near deaf, everything sounded distant and barely audible. I stood up only to find my legs were very stiff and uncooperative and then I realized that I don't really know what I'm doing. Where am I going? What's going on? I was completely confused and fumbled around trying to make sense out of anything. Some women nearby expressed concern over my well being and asked me if I needed an ambulance. I said yes, sat down on the ground and waited for the medics to arrive. After that it was mostly just lectures about drugs, IV fluids and slowly but surely my symptoms disappeared. I left the hospital at 3 PM feeling pretty normal, just a bit tired.

So, tonight. Tonight I did a syringe full of heroin IV. I should say that the heroin was much lower quality than the one I snorted before and I used a lot less, of course. That could explain why the overdose wasn't nearly as bad as the first one. Still it's interesting how fast was the onset of the symptoms. After the rush, I think I may have nodded for a few seconds. I was loosing time throughout the whole situation, short bursts of seconds were seemingly missing. As a result  it's hard for me to understand how exactly certain events happened. 

For example, the first symptom that I noticed was a small pop in my ears as I went deaf again, exactly like the first time. This sent my heart racing and gave me a huge anxiety attack, which I'm sure made things a lot better. I wanted to clean my ears with my fingers, because it's a rather uncomfortable feeling, which is when I discovered, I couldn't move my right arm. It went completely numb, very quickly. That would be very scary, fortunately that was not the arm I injected in, so I thought it had to be asleep. Like sometimes when you wake up, laying on your arm, and you can't feel it, or move it. That's what it was like. Theory was confirmed in a couple of minutes when I started to feel the crawling, or pins and needles, and I was able to slightly move my hand and make a weak fist. It didn't last very long, during the next hour my arm returned to normal and so did my hearing.

The biggest problem turned out to be the ridiculous double vision. I was trying to google some help for OD, but I couldn't even read the google logo. I was extremely tired and my eyes kept closing constantly and I had to repeatedly take manual breaths as my body seemingly forgot how to breath on it's own. Now that's what got me afraid. Sleep + respiratory arrest = death. Yeah so I tried pacing the room, slapping myself in the face, opening the window (I was also very hot and sweaty). Fortunately the whole thing stopped as quickly as it started. In about 90 minutes, I felt relatively normal again. My arms were both working, my hearing returned to normal, I could somewhat focus and I no longer felt this empty, cold dread in my lungs. Finally I gave in to tiredness and slept for about two hours and woke up recovered completely. Almost. I still have pinhole pupils, but that's to be expected.

Given my current and previous experience I can make an educated guess, that my dope is cut to oblivion, which is either what saved me, or what caused the problems in the first place. Hard to say. But at least now I have a battle plan for future. First step is to acquire Narcan, before continuing using. Second is to rent my own place, so I don't have to call an ambulance at 1 AM into my parent's house. Third is to buy some concealer makeup for the bruises. Fourth, reflect on the decisions I made in life. Nah, just kidding. Fourth is to buy a precision scale and stop eyeballing it.

EDIT: I get it, I get it, I didn't OD. I'm fine, it was just rather scary feeling, so I panicked.",1465199778.0

2:07 AM: Pop 2 5mg Valium
3:07 AM: (less than 5 minutes from now) - Plan on snorting 5-6 stamps of this new gear I've been getting...very dark grey/blueish color. I've had grey dope a handful of occasions before, and 95% of the time, it was a solid 8/10. But never have I gotten anything this dark before with a blue tint to it. Was almost hesitant to give it a go at first, but I got confirmation from my dude that it straight. And it sure is. 

My question is...anyone with experience with this combo of substances? I've taken Valium before in low doses (5-10mg) in combo with dope before and it was a very positive experience. No blacking out or doing anything dumb that is typically associated with benzos, excepted mixed with dope. 

I've also mixed dope with adderall before, as a comedown aid, with positive results, as well. 

My question is...I've never mixed all 3 together...what is the synergy like? Thanks for any input, all!

I've drank a big red bull earlier, is it possible that has eliminated so much of the high?

I'm wondering if I take either 5mg of diazepam, or 7,5 mg of zopiclone, would that be asking for an OD, even if your not nodding or feel out of it? This high feels like a weak dose of oxy w/o tolerance.

The next day i tried 100mg and noticed next to nothing.
I've read up quite a bit regarding this substance and usually the verdict is more mg equals a stronger effect.

One explantian could be tolerance effect but that would mean there's an almost absurd tolerance increase. I double dosed the next day and noticed [i]way[\i] not only no increased effect  but no effect at all.

I was  really happy with what I got with 50. So i will try that again.

We did our last shot- oh the doom of knowing our hustle has to begin. I took a Xanax because I had not slept yet and I was so very tired but couldn't sleep. He left for work and I woke up for the day at 1pm. Shortly after awaking I am getting blown up by an ex who is black mailing me telling me I need to come to his place immediately or he will do x, y, and z. I arrive and our mutual friend Sara is there- I'm starting to feel sick already... It's amazing how quick I went from having 24 hours between doses to less than 12. They are scheming on picking up. Her dude, whom I've never met is on his way back from the city nearby with some good shit. He agrees to meet up on his way home- wants $200 for a G- Ha! I'd never pay that.. Anyway.. We drive to Harris teeter to meet and minutes are slipping by. Sara has a bad feeling. She is calling and texting and dude is not answering. Finally he calls back- he says he has ""broken down"" and needs to be picked up. We drive about 5 miles to him and see his truck- totaled and another car- totaled. The high idiot was drinking a beer and rear ended someone. There are 3 cop cars. They gave him a field sobriety test and he passed- they didn't find any drugs- just called a tow truck and helped him get all his shit out of his truck. We pull over near by and start moving his crap into my car. It's a lot of crap- 3 chain saws, giant shears, rakes, fishing poles, my car is packed with four people and all his shit. His truck is towed and we leave the scene. About 2 miles later we run out of gas (my gas gauge doesn't work), I grab my always full 2 gallon can of gas and dump it in. We go back to my exes house- his mom is going to be home so we have 15 minutes to all four do a shot. Boom we succeed. I was supposed to drive him home 40 mins away but luckily Sara says she will do it and we transfer his crap to her car. I leave and run by my house- I'm in need of a few books to read and some more clothes. I'm there for 15 minutes before heading back to my boyfriends with another laundry basket of crap. I arrive and it's time to work my main hustle- middle manning for a local dealer. I drive to pick up his cash and all 5 of my city connects are either out, going to get it, at work, or phones of. Great... We get the cash and decide to ride up there anyway and wait for someone to get off or get back with shit. Finally a dude we haven't gone thru in months due to him having a shitty batch hits us. He is our only option and we just hope it's good. We do the deal and dude just drops all the bags in my car... They fall every where and I'm pretty sure we are missing one or two bags- that are ours for doing the deal. He hooks it up good with weight- we ride to near by McDonald's and get high. It's great stuff! Oh what a relief- my tolerance is way to high to get some bullshit. We ride back- drop shit off to dude- and head home. Once home we do a real shot. I'm in bed nodding off to sleep by 11:30. I awake at 1- wide awake. I sit up reading for a few hours and then my bf wakes up.. It's 4:30. We do what he hope isn't out last shot. Hoping we will find a bag in my car when we wake up for real later. Still not very tired- this shot wasn't very big. Blah blah blah.

I have tried toradol in the past but it does literally nothing for me. My neurologist would probably be open to prescribing me something stronger as a rescue med but I'm not sure what that might be - I thought vicodin might be good stuff (seeing as it's such a big deal for Dr. House lol) but if I am understanding correctly, percoset is actually stronger.

I brought enough to use through the flight and pop the last roxy at landing. (btw- snorting roxys in plane bathrooms is a thrill)

I am now at 72 hours and I actually feel okay. It's 3pm here and I haven't had to work or do ANYTHING since I stopped.

What I DID use is close to the thomas recipe (potassium, multivitamin, mineral supplement, lots of water). After Day 1 I was freaking out and actually got a local (western) doctor to give me xanax and ambien. I even admitted I used to be on opiates, but didn't bring them due to the strictness of the country. He ignored my remark, called it travel fatigue+minor viral condition and gave me the xanax and ambien.

So with his help (I took everything he gave me at once- obviously- supposed to last 5-7 days, but we all know how our tollys are) I slept on night 2 and woke up day 3 to a fruit/veggie protein shake with yogurt and berries. I went to the gym and walked 30 minutes on the treadmill. I'll admit I'm spending my 3 weeks in a luxury compound so I've had steams/saunas/hottubs/fit centers available to me.

But at 72 hours, I'm about to go pick up more of the xanax and ambien and hopefully get one more solid night sleep. Wake up and start the Ltyrosine+b6 portion of the thomas recipe.

The worst part of all of this was being so far from home on days 1-2. It took me until day 2 to go to a high end grocery to buy gallons of water, Gatorade, protein drinks, berries. Once I started hydrating nourishing it made a world of difference.

So Day 4 tomorrow, and I'm hoping for a good night sleep tonight (night 3) and to get in front of my colleagues tomorrow recovered from ""my gringo stomach+minor viral condition in this exotic land"".

Everytime at home I would take my last dose friday at work and tell myself I'd detox sat/sun maybe call in sick monday and be great by day 4. I had all sorts of benzos (way more than here) and weed and western comforts (ensure, Gatorade). Sunday night I always called my dealer and 20 minutes later....6 roxys up my nose. How many weekends I wasted feeling like shit only to relapse.

I jumped at this opportunity to go on this work trip...I knew three weeks away was needed. I need to be clean in the fall when I go to grad school. Days 1/2 I was ready to hop on a plane home and waive the white flag. Every night was a sweaty battle. That xanax/ambien saved my life and got me through.

for background, im a high functioning addict with a high pressure 24 hour job making a lot of money, but still in deep debt bc of my stupid fucking habit. Hoping to come back clean in 2.5 weeks and start anew. There is ALWAYS hope. There is ALWAYS and a chance. Whether it's on this earth or somewhere else. Hope.



tldr; get away, use ~thomas recipe, stay nourished, SOME benzos/sleep aids will help, mild exercise and heat/steam/hottub",1465283185.0

I thought I would create a space/thread appropriate for denoting these stories. I have always found that when high I have quite an open, free, and promiscuous sexual aptitude. During my dope ventures I have had group sex scenarios with different genders and types of people, never a hair raised or terribly anxious or concerned regarding whatever.
My ex-fiance and I were in a three person relationship at one point. She was in a relationship at the time with a video artist and both were addicts. I was new to the dope game and one night we all shot up and started snuggling on a wispy mattress, soon evolving into kissing and whimsical fingers wandering through cloth. Clothes fell and he began fucking her and she pulled my briefs down, and started licking me. No orgasms of course, we were junkies after all.

This wasn't the only three person sex scenario she and I (we soon became dope-crossed lovers and a bit of a team, often fucking for hours fueled by dope and lust) were involved in, as we would often get high and play with a mutual friend. I never thought much of it, carried by an opiate-crazed cloud. Now, in reflection, the ideas and memories of what happened are much more exciting than they were at the time.

Prologue: I am not here to preach recovery or say if you dont get clean you will die. Thats not why I'm here. I am here to simply share my story with everyone. I was inspired by a story I read earlier here written by /u/swakelyal 

#The Year: 2011 (October)

My girlfriend and I had just found out a few months earlier that we were expecting our first child. We had been dating for 3.5 years at this point and with this news decided it best to get our own place. So we did. A month later, I proposed. 

At this point in time I am just drinking and smoking pot. My girlfriend (even before becoming pregnant) was only a mild drinker. And had not consumed anything harmful to her or baby since finding out the news. 

Most of you here would probably consider us pretty ""normal"" - working members of society, both had jobs, both file federal tax returns, both own a car, never any trouble with the law - you know ""normies""

I had always known she had a problem with me smoking pot. I never did it around her ever. But she could smell it on me and taste it in our kisses. She complained frequently. So with the news of her being pregnant, and for the health of our child, I vowed to stop smoking pot after our son was born. 

#December 23, 2011

I left the hospital that night as my fiance slept peacefully. Not knowing this was the day before my son would be born, I headed on a rather long drive to meet my pot dealer for one last hoorah before my son graced us with his presence. I spent the night/early morning smoking and drinking at a strip club in the city. 

The next day, my son was born late in the evening. And as promised, I discarded the left over weed from the previous night with joy and ease. The feeling of being a father was greater than any feeling pot would give me. 

#January 2012

We are home. We are a family. I havent smoked since Dec. 23rd. and only a few beers during that time. Baby is healthy. Things are going well. I love holding him in my arms watching him stare up at me. But before long, the added tension on my back started to cause issues. I went to my family doctor and they prescribe me Naproxen (nothing more than super powered advil/tylenol)

Doesnt work. 

*****

And this is where my downfall begins.........

Having vowed to give up smoking pot, I had to find something to replace it with - booze didnt cut it. And now my back was hurting. I hit up a few friends and manage to get a hold of a 30s. Legit. I crush it up and snort it, as i did with most pills that didnt burn - bad habit from my summer of coke binges years prior all this. Man do I feel great. Back pain is gone. Body feels wonderful. It didnt even hurt when I had a metal toy car thrown at my head. 

As with anything, all good things come to an end. A few days later, the pain is worse than ever in my back. I repeat the steps and get my hands on a few 30s - figured I'd stock up and have them for when I need them. I got 5 for a discounted price. 

They lasted 4 hours. 

You see where this is going. The progression my addiction drug me was fast and furious. By the time I took that 3rd pill, I couldnt get enough. I couldn't feel numb enough (physically). It felt great. I was still functioning - going to work and such. 

That ability to function FADED FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAST. 

Before I knew it I was behind on bills, rent, lacking money for baby food and diapers and formula. You know - the essentials for my son. 

#Fast Forward: March 2013 - St. Patricks Day - Our Wedding

My addiction had progressed to a several hundred dollar a day habit. Not making enough money at work to support my family AND my addiction, I had already begun stealing from them. Forging and writing checks to myself for thousands of dollars. A serious crime. And yet, still behind on bills and necessary living essentials. 

My one groomsman was my closest using buddy. I told him not to get me a wedding gift, but to just bring a few 30s for the day figuring I could sneak off and bump one every once in a while. He didnt come through. At this point, I hadnt used in the last 24 hours. So as a fall back I was plan on drinking and getting a little shitfaced for the wedding and dancing and such....but I was too sick to even do that. Ceremony went fine. I was sweating like a pig. Probably a combination on things, but I attribute it mostly to withdrawal. Barely touched my dinner at the reception. And had 1/2 of a mix drink. I was just not feeling the day. In fact, I tell people this all the time....a day, that is supposed to be one of the happiest days of anyones life, was actually one of the most miserable days I had ever experienced. 

How pathetic is that? I'm getting married and with the exception of the first dance, mother/son dance, and the whole garter ceremony thing, I was basically sitting, sick, in front of family and friends. Little did they know it was withdrawal sickness. I played it off as ""one hell of a bachelor party the night before"". 

#April 2013 

My using had continued as usually - dropping as much as $700 in a day sometimes. Our honeymoon was coming up this month. A cruise to the Bahamas. My genius brain told me that ""what better way/time to get clean than on a boat in the middle of the ocean surrounded by strangers and my wife."" 

Big Mistake. 

I thought my wedding day was the most horrible day I had experienced....well it was until my cruise set sail. Stuck in the middle of the ocean. Withdrawing. Nauseous. Miserable. I didnt sleep for the first 3 days. I was emotional. I missed my son. I missed my drugs. I wanted to go home. 

I struggled to get through the cruise. The end was significantly better than the beginning. But as soon as we were back in our hometown, i was ringing my ""friends"" so I could pick up. 

This went on for another few months until the first week in August. My parents had paid the last few months of our rent. My car was uninsured at this point. Still struggling to keep up with the mass exodus of diapers leaving my house and the jars of baby food. 

Everything I could pawn was gone. Mine and hers. She hadn't noticed the missing jewelry she never wore. If only i could have gotten that engagement and wedding ring off her finger. That would be gone too. I was a mess. Effectively destroyed everything I had. Tore my family to shreds in just a year and a half. Went from 1 ox30 to an expense that would make some gamblers cringe. And nothing to show for it. 

#August 2013

I'm admitted into a rehab facility relatively close to home (not a Florida or Cali ""getaway"" rehab). By the time my stay there came to an end, I had experienced emotional breakdowns. Miserable mornings. Pooping normally for the first time in what felt like years. My parents and wife visited me on separate occasions. I was ready to come home and stay clean. 

I hit a meeting (NA) my first night out of rehab. And continued to do so for the next 120+ days. In that time, my wife and I and our son moved back to my parents house in order to start saving the money I mindlessly snorted away. After a few weeks of meetings every night (I was fortunately to get a job relatively soon after rehab - working full time in my field of my college degree). My wife approached me and told me something along the lines of ""i hate that you go to so many meetings. its like you work, come home, eat dinner, go to a meeting, and by the time you get home, R (our son - name omitted), is asleep. You go to bed. wake up and do it all over again""

I remember this because I had over 60 days clean at that point. I simply looked at her and said ""would you rather me go pawn some more of your jewelry or steal money from you?"" She didnt give an answer. She couldnt. She knew that me getting and staying clean was important to me...and so that our son could actually have a father. But she also wanted me around more. I tried to assure her that I wouldn't be going to meetings every day for the rest of my life. But right now, I needed them. I was still dumb. I didnt know how to live in the ""real world"" - living without the fog and haze from the drugs. I didnt know how to function normally. I needed these meetings. And they kept me clean. 

That didnt stop her and she filed for divorce after only 5 months of marriage. 

#Fast Forward: Today

Today I have 2 years, 9 months, 29 days clean. I have my own place. I have a car which I bought with my money. I have a motorcycle. I have THINGS. They are all great and all but this is the best part. I am happy today. I am not curled up dope sick. I am not stealing from ANYONE - family, friends, employers....nobody. I pay my bills on time. Today, I am an adult. 28 years old. 2 handsome young boys which I have 50-50 custody with. And I couldnt ask for anything more. I, can 100% guarantee I didnt get here because I am using drugs. But because I decided to change myself. To change how I live.

*****

There is a lot more to my story - I left out a lot of the battle stories and consequences from my actions (or lack there of). But here is a short list of some of the shit I dealt with right after I got clean (within the first year). 

* divorce

* custody hearings

* 7 using buddies (2 of which I was with daily) died in the first year I was clean

* death of my grandmother - first family death in over 10 years

* calls from detectives about the money I stole from my previous employer

* my parents paying off the 70k I embezzled to keep me out of jail and in my son's life. (I have since paid back 50K of that in just under 2 years). But when I first got clean I was pretty much begging them to let me go to jail. That was their retirement money the basically bailed me out with. I am grateful I have been able to pay much of it back and continue to make payments to them monthly)

* birth of my second son (same mother - we tried ""working things out"" through the divorce process and she ended up pregnant again)

But, I'll finish up with this. I worked hard to get where I'm at. I work for a large international company making enough money to support myself and my boys and continue to pay off the debt I racked up during my addiction.

 .

Im going to ramble a little about myself and why im asking. 

 Im on it now for detox from heroin. It doesn't feel very effective for pain. I get that my tolerance is high but it seems that suboxone only effects my mental cravings my body still will be hurting. Also I heard that methadone will be prescribed once daily for opiate dependancy while when it is for pain relief it is taken every 6 hours (by some people) idk I take my sub dose split up so that I take something 3 times a day. People say im lying or its in my head when I say I can feel withdrawl from suboxone after 12 hours. But I really do feel in pain and im wondering if it the same thing where maybe bup needs to be taken more often for pain management than it does addiction. I would say I don't get mental craving until 24 hours after sub dose but I feel pain setting in after a few hours.

I have serve depression since I can think. (Amongst a lot of other diagnosis) I tried every legal anti depressiva and was in many psychatric hospitals. Nothing helps. Absolutely nothing. 


I started reading about using Buprenophine as anti depressiva: 


http://www.google.de/patents/EP2001456B1?cl=en


http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2014/03/19/suboxone-buprenorphine-for-treatment-resistant-depression-partial-mu-opioid-agonist/


A company even wants to create New Antidepressant ALKS 5461. 


I tried 0.2-0.4 mg x 3 a day of Buprenorphine:


It felt like my depression was gone. This fucking part in my brain that kept me from doing anything? - gone. I decided to clean my room and I could do stuff. Felt like a normal person. 


People around me noticed that I was ""happy"" the way I talked and interacted with them. 


No high. 



Now many questions. I guess the dosis of 0.2 -  0.4 mg x 3 Buprenophine a day is very low. 


How long could I take this dosis? Will I need more and more? 


No doctor will describe it to me - all say it's bodily harm (German: Körperverletzung) 


Only legal way to get it would be buying it (illegal), taking it and then going to a 
substitutions doctor. Well then I would have to go their every morning at the same time to get it. And well I would be treated as a normal drug addictit in all the paperwork. I don't know if that is worth it and he could denie me and tell me to go to a withdrawal clinic. 


Buying it illegal is too expensive. 


I don't want to get high. I just want my fucking depression to go away... 


It feels like a finally found a solution but I don't know if it's only temporary and what I can do about that solution. Any advice of what I could do? Am I missing something? Any advice? Feeling lost.

a lil background on me. ive had two big runs with heroin in my life. from 2005 to 2009 and 2013 to present i would guess.
first time i went to jail and rehab, got on subs, got off subs, stayed clean for quite some time.

during that time i really clung to the stay busy or relapse kind of thinking. id regularly work a shit ton AND take on school. No problem.

i was almost done with my associates when i relapsed. stop signing up for classes because i knew i was just wasting money if i went to college in full blown active addiction. went to work oilfield for awhile. hated that. came back and got hired on at my local hospital working in the er. i wanna be a nurse so this is right up my alley. pay and benefits are decent too. got on subs again. i will occasionally step off subs to get high when i just cant stand it anymore but thats not very often.

this time around i cannot muster up any energy at all to get to work on school. before i relapse i worked 2 part time jobs and was taking full time credit hours. was beyond busy but happy and never seamed to struggle really until like finals time. now i can barely get myself up off the couch to get started.

i regret all the damage ive done to my life with my addictio,, but hot necessarily the addiction itself because its molded me in ways i kind of like. but holy fuck i wish i could stop being lazy.

(With a moral for you kids)","So first off today I took suboxone too soon from my last dose thinking I'd be okay.... I was wrong. Wasn't the worst hour of my life but PW was miserable. 

I was already late for work by an hour and told my boss hel'll probably fire me next time but I called my friend and asked if she had spare dope if I could use it to make PW's go away, she said no and that she couldn't. 

Currently I have no cash as I bought a prepaid debit card and can't use it at ATMs or for cash back, but my dealer graciously agreed to trade a fifty something inch tv I found on the road( he doesn't know that ) that has minor issues and a fifth of Hennessy Privilege. 

So I oblige, luckily he's close by my house as he usually is before the ""work day"" starts for him. Now took 2mg suboxone orally and 1mg I shot up. By the time I got the dope the PW's were pretty much over and I felt good. So i know this guys stuff is fire so I only did two bags and although I believe I'd be the exception to modern medicine and science or whatever but that shit did not work( go figure ) so at my lunch break about 4hours after my sun boxing I tried to just do one more and that shit didn't work again. So when I got home from work I immediatly took a bunch of hydroxizine so I could sleep until it was atleast 12 hours past subs because I figured since I never take subs that a shot of 4 bags would do the trick. Well, it was about 14.5 hours after the suboxone. This time it worked but not as good as four bags of this normally would. I would typically be nodding out hard right now. I wish I would have waited until tomorrow morning to do it. 

The moral of the story,  don't think because some people claim they can get high a few hours after suboxone. And although it might work around 12 hours after if you took a small dose and it's not in your system just wait the fucking 24 hours. That was the last dope ill have for like a week and I completely screwed myself over because I am grossly impatient. ",1465356943.0

Of comfort

Almost as if its crumbling 

You feel the vibration through your feet and into your legs

You can only wait as it bellows and grows stronger

Creeping in, almost beckoning you as it gains ground

You stare at it, and it stares back
Grinding its teeth, scuffing it's hooves, rearing back to strike

There is a moment of understanding

A mutual agreement

And it's really consistent. But he's not always the best about his phone consistency. So what is there to do when I don't get an answer? Take to the streets of course. The stuff I've gotten on the streets the last two times has been good. Like, really good. Like, too good.

Two weeks ago I got a dub from a spot. It only weighed .13g. I had taken suboxone 4.5 hours prior. I did my dub expecting nothing, but I did it anyways to feel it out because my girl had a dub of the same shit. My normal dose is .3g to .5g. And... Well... I did the .13 and it fully broke the sub barrier. No problem. I wasn't super high, but I was high and shouldn't have been. And I'm kind of scared that it takes something higher affinity than dope to break through a sub barrier like that. It was a full 8mg. I worried about fentanyl, or something else, but I brushed it off, thinking, ""I won't cold cop in this spot again. No worries.""

This brings me to last night. Dboy isn't answering. I have a friend with me, and we have to go cold cop. And I go to a different spot, and I do .15g because I got shorted. Half my minimum dose. And I'm floored. Not sure what happened. But if I had done my normal dose, I'm not entirely sure I'd be talking about this.

I could be paranoid. I could be used to mediocre dope, which I'm fairly sure I'm not. I'm not sure what's up with the shit I've been getting. Its tar, but it could have something extra put in it. I don't know. But people around here, please be careful. Buy from someone you trust. Do test shots of anything new you get, and of anything off a corner. Don't be expecting bad dope off the corner.

First timer.,"Okay, so I first tried H about 4 months ago after a bad breakup. I used it regularly for awhile but slowed down to maybe once every couple weeks just because I like to have fun. Anyway, long story short, a couple of days ago I got some really good stuff and ODed. My friend was there and called 911 and cops and ambulance came and I was given a few shots of Narcan and taken to the emergency room.

I wasn't charged with anything at the time but the cops confiscated the spoon I used, the needle, and a few weed bowls and about an eighth of weed. In the process of being taken to the hospital the sheriff that came ended up accidentally keep ing my driver's license, so I called yesterday and was able to get him to bring it back last night. He was very friendly and expressed concern for me. He said that he was going to write a report and forward the charges on to the prosecutor's office and that it was up to them to decide whether they want to officially charge me. I asked about chances of that and he said he can't really say, maybe 50/50.

I understand that my chances aren't great but I'm wondering about what charges I might ultimately face. I didn't lick or clean the spoon after I used it and didn't flush the needle. I'm wondering if they can charge me with possession of heroin just from the tiny amount of residue they find or whether they would just charge me with possession of paraphernalia. Also, this wasn't my apartment and the weed and bowls that were confiscated weren't mine but my ""friend"" kinda threw me under the bus since he was scared and said that they were mine. Would it do any good to tell the truth and say they were his? Is that a dick move? 

I was just hoping to get a better idea of what I might be expecting because I've never had anything like this happen before. I've been arrested twice when I was 19 for illegal consumption and I got those expunged. Other than that I have a completely clean record. 

Does anybody have any experience with this? Is there another subreddit that I could post to that might be able to help?

Usually was a .2 a day but sometimes as much as a gram and a half. It was unbelievable heroin. Fluffy, white rocks that were just unlike anything else I've ever copped. I've had good dope, this shit was *great*. You could cut it half/half and it was still pretty good. I lucked out with a connect that junkies go entire lives without getting close to. I wasn't particularly savvy in this business or anything, I just had a friend who had a brother who had a friend and blah blah blah.

So shit hit the fan and I had to abruptly stop using (in all my months of using, I'd only run out maybe 4-6 times each for a period of 24 hours or less). I made it 36hours into some pretty terrible withdrawal that really gave me a reality check but I had subs. 4mg held me the first day, 2mg the next day, and then 1mg or even less for the next few days. Yesterday I didn't take any subs. I did 2 bags of dope but I barely felt shit (guess the subs still kickin).

Wake up today feeling dandy as a flower. No fiending, no scrambling for my phone, just feeling content and knowing if I get a bit sick I got plenty of medicine. I've been working out again, keeping a good sleep schedule, eating better, etc. My life is back on track.

I'm not your drug dealer bro"" My friend who was meeting his ""friend"" didn't even know who we were meeting for sure.. I digress...

The guy hands the money back and says ""I'm a walking pharmacy though, what're you guys looking for?""

My eyes widen and I quickly blurt ""OPANA?""

He says ""No opana but bars for $3 and blues for $15 since I'm broke"" 

Blues are normally double price so I say fuck it and load up on cheap bars and 7 blues for $100

It's dark but I check the pills and see light blue ovals and assume they're the correct pills and carry on getting the coke

Once we get home and I check my new cheap stash I realize these aren't blues at all.. I call the guy and begin cursing him saying he sold me bullshit and he assures me they're generic oxy...

So I've tried blues, the oxy 30's with ""U24"" and the ""A215"" printed on them.  Since I'm naive to opiates, I take it slow, and never did more than half a pill (all snorted) and never all at once.  15 mg would get me pretty freaking hard, combined with dabs I was definitely sitting there struggling to stay awake; I felt amazing too!

Now, for the first time I have a confirmed 10/325 hydro/acetomet, and I'm curious how this is going to effect me vs the oxycodone I've sampled?  Roughly how does 10mg of hydro compare to 10mg of oxy?  Oxycodone is stronger I'm assuming.

I just don't want to get too high and get nausea and possibly throw up.  I'm sure I wouldn't, but I just want to know if I'll be overwhelmed taking the whole pill at once.

I hate the media, tv shows, movies, and shit glorifying the use of opiates. like house, nurse Jackie, etc. the news always talks about the opioid epidemic, and somehow that makes people want to try them??

hey, this drug will ruin your life and then kill you. better try it!

I can't stress to opiate-naïve people enough, opioids will grab a hold of you, chew you and your life up, and shit you out on the corner, or in a morgue. they're no fucking joke. 

I'm sure there are a lot of people that will agree with me. and every thread I see about somebody who wants to ""start"" I tell them this. same shit. why the fuck would you want to ""start"" using opioids? it's like somebody saying they want to be a meth head. or a junkie. so fucking stupid. 

I love this sub. it's really the only one I frequent. the people here are great. stories are great. people are supportive. helpful. understanding. but 99% of us HAVE A PROBLEM. and 99% of us (I think) would go back and stop ourselves from going down this road if we could. I know I would go back and smack myself silly. 

people don't know what they're getting themselves into. it's no fucking joke. if you want the experience, just get hit by a bus and then go lay in bed if you're not dead. feels the same in the end. 

I just wish more people would stay the fuck away from opioids. it hurts me to see so many people ""interested"" in ruining their lives, and the relationships they have with people. the opiate/opioid road does not end well. it just doesn't.

Then I got a headache, and my left side of my chest is really hurting.. on the inside.  It feels like my heart.  And my left side is hurting a lot too.  I took 160 my oxy.. waited 15 minutes.. nothing.   Took another 160... waited 30 min... headache is now gone but nose is still plugged to shit and heart and side are really bothering me.  I've drank a ton of water, and eaten about 6 yogurts.  I look in the mirror to see my usual pinpoint pupils.. and they're dilated instead.  It's been an hour or so since I took my first dose of oxy.

I noticed that she always makes sure not to actually shoot up in front of me, which seemed pretty weird to me because we both do it. I kinda peeping-tommed her to see what she was actually doing, and it turns out she's just been injecting right into her arm like you would if you were IM'ing, but with IV needles so obviously there is little (if any) effect at all. I've noticed she has multiple abcesses and seems to think they're a common thing? I ended up confronting her about it because I care about her and her health and where she's injecting just really looks horrible. I've tried explaining to her multiple times since then how bad it is to do it/no high (realistically the high is most likely 80% mental)/dangerous/just dumb as hell and she tries to laugh it off like a joke or pretends (badly) to take is serious. I told her to do it IV like a normal person and she acted like she didn't even know how (which brought up a million other questions about her honesty with drug history and other things) and I have been basically teaching her how do she doesn't keep doing this. It seemed like she was doing good/actually getting hi but the other morning caug ther trying to just miss again because she was ""tired"". I don't understand this. Do any of you do this?? Is it effective? I don't understand the reasons of ""laziness/low self worth"" behind it. I lost a lot of trust with her after this leading to her stories not matching up, etc... Why doesn't the seriousness through her head? 
TLDR; 
Chick at my uni is purposely missing shots and got caught in a million lies in the process. 
Does anyone else do this?
Is this a 100% mental high? Does that make the withdrawal 100% mental too?
Why not buy IM needles? (opposed to short IVs)
Why waste the cash?

So my usual connect that nearly always has fire has been out for nearly a week so I've been going to my backup guy.

It mixes up into a light yellowish color and there is little no cut left behind in the spoon.  All that is fine and dandy of course but when I use it, I essentially get no rush and very mild euphoria and sedation compared to the dope I usually get.  The kicker though is the stuff from my backup that I just described has pretty good legs and it keeps me well way past my normal dope does which is usually 10-12 hours.

So what I was curious about is does this stuff sound like any sort of research chemical that anyone has had experience with?  I'm sure it's probably just weak dope but the long legs has me wondering. Anyways, I appreciate anyone's input.",1465516000.0

With a 1.5"" needle, won't I increase the risk of going right through the vein? The action on them is a bit smoother than my 29Gs but now I'm wondering if I'm fucking up by using insulin needles. I can get both 23G or 29G in unlimited supply.",1465515203.0

I've suffered from chronic depression and  general lack of passion since middle school when I came to the sad realization that I wasn't going to be as cool, popular or as good looking as the other kids. I grew up in a white middle class home with two parents who love each other and are still married to this day. I've taken IQ tests and score above the 90th percentile. From the outside I don't think anyone ever suspected I was depressed until I was graduating high school. I've always been adept at acting how others want to perceive me. If you want the innocent white boy that's who you saw. If you wanted the smart college bound student, that's what you got. Looking back I suppose it was a mechanism to keep people from knowing who I was. Ironically as I came out from my inner world the senior year of high school and throughout college I grew increasingly resentful of who I was, who I pretended to be and what I figure I can never be. This self-depreciation permeated everything I did and still do. My first experience was with opiates was the snorting of a roxy 30 at fifteen. I wouldn't touch another opiate outside of the occasional hydro for five years. I eked out of college with a sub par GPA and an ever increasing lack of passion for life. Without the droll of schoolwork and the lack of job prospects I got bored. I honestly haven't done roxy since high school all the years ago, but look at me now; addicted to heroin. I'm not even sure why I tried heroin. A good friend of mine is a chronic user and I asked him for a hit one day. He would have never pushed it on me, he knew the dangers all too well. He didn't explicitly say it, but we both are adults and aware of our actions and the consequences that arise from them. I haven't been using for a decade, or five years. I can't begin to understand the magnitude of an addiction so out of control. I know this path is wrong. At first I thought heroin was my salvation. It made me feel how I imagined all of those tall good looking guys who went to my school felt. For a few moments I was normal. It didn't matter that I wasn't tall, good looking or silver tongued. I had an inner peace that I have never experienced before. The fears of life melted away. We all know where that dragon takes us. Immediately I was using five or six times a day. Blowing through money and hiding my use from my girlfriend and loved ones. I'm sure they noticed but I didn't care. I nodded through the days and I don't think I have ever been happier. I'm sure you know how the rest of the story goes. The money dries up, friends notice strange behavior, the normalness I felt turned into bitterness and contempt for myself. Withdrawals are debilitating, and hatred is plentiful. I don't really have a point for this post. I was feeling isolated and I know others feel the same. Fuck I don't even buy my drugs on the street I get them shipped to my front door. Literally no one that I didn't want to know could find out. The only people who know right know are my girlfriend, and two other friends who only know because we all use. My girlfriend is the only non-user who has any idea. I've considered telling my friends, who by the grace of God I have an amazing group of people around me. I just don't want the attention. I'd rather sit in the back and watch than deal with the emotions of telling my beloved friends. Some day I hope to be free and see the world as it is, not through half open eyes.This post is mostly a rant from an insomniac in withdrawal, but if you've read this far I thank you. If you are addicted like me I would stand in solidarity with you, knowing all to well how little life means and how fulfilling heroin can be. If you don't use, I won't tell you to stay away, but opiates are a fight you will lose. The house always wins. Thank you.",1465501816.0

So, longggg story short:  I am in hellacious, uncontrollable, unbearable pain due to a nerve condition.  Opioids work not well on me.  I feel nothing: no drowsiness, relaxation, sleepiness, well-being, etc.  And unfortunately very little pain relief.
I was in hospital for a month and the docs were shocked at how they had to keep raising the doses cuz I was practically screaming in pain.  So....I ran out of my meds (fantanyl and oxycodone) couple days ago and I can't ask doc for refill for 5 more days.  My mom says I need to go to ER, this is a true medical emergency.  Plus she wants it on my med rec that the pain is worse now, and uncontrollable, so that the docs GET IT, and help me more from now on.  The ONLY reason I don't want to go is that a friend gave me a little methadone or hydromorphone....and he said to just use a tiny bit per day.  If I go to ER, it'll be in my urine.  My mom says ""WHO CARES!!??  People will do ANYTHING to escape this kind of pain....PLUS withdrawal.  So the docs will understand that u r NOT a drug seeker....but a person who actually has no quality of life due to this hell.  All I can do is sit/pace/cry 24/7.  I can't go on like this anymore.  They NEED to find a way to help me!!!!  So, my question is:  I shouldn't really care about whether an unprescribed drug is in my body? Is it that big of a deal at ER?  I have been trying to find what I'm prescribed somewhere so that when I would go back to doc....I'd be 'legal' and copacetic.  So, honestly what do u think?  I know you shouldn't use someone else's opioids.  But....when you feel like you're DYING in pain....isn't that what matters....? In other words....docs are in the business to help people, and uncontrollable pain IS a medical emergency, so I feel like they truly will understand.  It's not like I'm shooting heroin.
I can't ask my pcp; not happening.   Any suggestions; I am seriously so desperate.  And my mom keeps crying and crying begging me to let her take me to ER.  BTW: I haven't been able to eat for days and days and am losing large amt of weight a day, and I was already way too thin.  She says there is NO other answer.  Go to the hospital and let the professionals do what I need to have done....treat my pain immediately and hopefully strongly.  Then everything is 'reset'....I""ll only have what they give me and the script from when I leave there and I won't have to worry about something in urine that shouldn't be there.  Can you think of any other answers????  What is your opinion?  Pls help!!!! Thanx so much.

I posted a few weeks ago saying how worried I was about returning to my situation after being away on vacation, cleaning up and surprisingly going through a scary-easy withdrawal with the help of loperamide.

Inspired by a few recent posts in r/opiates about tripping and getting off drugs / resetting their addiction / giving life a new perspective. I'd like to share my LSD experience. Its still early days, but I still feel great and much more

About 18 months ago, I had previously been through an Ibogaine practitioner in the UK. My desperate parents forked out nearly £3,000 to do it.. (fuck it, I've done subutex, 5 rehabs, both short term and up to 4 months. What else is left but extreme solutions). I obviously have deep addiction issues and am a chronic lapser. I was fed up with using 6 months in and that was 7 years ago. 

As for Ibogaine, I'm still angry about it. Intense my ass.. I barely felt it, total scam in my opinion (my experience, not the idea itself). I should have just ordered it myself online but my parents wanted me in a safe place after reading it can be quite heavy on the heart. 

Fuck the war on drugs. The government treating addicts like hedonistic weekend warriors and not the mental health issue it so clearly is. Total ban of MDMA and Psychedelics inuding for research purposes has been holding back the search for relief in those suffering from PTSD, anxiety, depression, addiction etc. For decades.

Here in the UK Professor David Nutt is my hero, check him out and his lectures on YouTube if you have time. As a professor of neurology and neuropharmacology, he was hired by the government as an advisor on drugs, he knows more about their safety, effects and potential therapeutic techniques than anyone.. he was hired as an advisor because he is an expert and politicians are not.
After giving his report on what is and isnt dangerous (how alcohol and cigerettes kill more people than all the other illegal drugs combined x 1000!). The politicians disagreed and fired him. This speaks volumes about our draconian laws and views on the whole damn damn issue. Don't like the truth, fire your advisor and sweep it under the rug. Let the turf wars and deaths continue, the billion dollar black market thrive and impurities give many of these safer drugs a bad name.

Prof Nutt was against the recent UK blanket psychoactive substance ban - after crunching all the numbers, the deaths attributed to cocaine plummeted when M-Cat came out because it was safer, when the media jumped on it and got it banned, cocaine related deaths rose above pre-ban levels because those that tried the legal high and had it taken away, switched to dirty illegal cut substances. Where is the education? Where is the harm reduction? Its nothing but stigmatism and ignorance. These many recent celebrity deaths have helped to sadly highlight the problem of indescriminate addiction (Amy Winehouse, Philip S-Hoffmann, Prince,  M Jackson, Peaches Geldoff.. its endles)

Prof. Nutt's recent studies on psychedelics is facinating. The first images of a tripping brain in an MRI machine. The results of these studies for people with depression and addiction are OUTSTANDING. 

Get this though.. Some politician in the houses of parliament read the title of the study and demanded in government this scientific study be closed down because it used an illegal drug. Regardless of the positive outcomes or having applied for all the legal permits to do the study, this person simply saw 'MDMA in Treatment Resistant PTSD' and freaked out. This is an example of the bullshit scaremongering and outdated thinking and opposition that everyone needs to challenge in order to move research on. Important research into LSD type chemicals, Ketamine in depression..  consciousness research has been held back 50+ years because of painfully failed prohibition which has done more harm than good.


Anyway, After YEARS of H abuse, I'm now over 2 weeks clean, thanks to a smooth rapid 3 day taper with loperamide (I just heard this is in the news too recently isnt it? But this been a legal GODSEND for me. What are they scared of now!?).

Most of the withdrawals were gone, haven't slept in 12 , but good or bad, I am trusting in the power of the reset. So, Midnight on Tuesday, I dropped 200ug of 1P-LSD.

My first trip in 10 years. Ambivalent feelings of anxiety and excitement. I know both sides of acid all too well!

Lost the plot sufficiently to stop writing things down. It was intense, but nothing I couldn't handle, communicating all those thoughts was pointless and virtually impossible!

I have the money my pocket, but deleted all my numbers. 

Last night was all out enjoyment, I didn't go the epic introspective. I barely steered the trip at all, the wine let comedy unfurl. I didn't have to have an introspective nightmare to weed through my addiction, just being in the moment felt like the biggest change to my everyday consciousness, which may be why meditation works for so many. Addiction is all about the pain of the past and what the hell you are going to do in order to stay well tomorrow. There is no real enjoyment of the moment. Whatever opiate you get, it won't be enough, when it runs out, you'll want more. Feeling like you are truly loving the moment you are in on psychedelics is something I haven't remembered I could feel for a long time. Addiction to me feels like I am just stretched across time, unrelaxed, anxious, in pain or brief relief.

Update.

Its been 2 days and I still feel an afterglow. I've made some calls to get work and some short term benefits, thought about work (I have volunteered at a recovery cafe in town too!)

So, this could be it for me. I hope so.
I'm going to try a few meetings and I MUST do some exercise because thats like free feel-good drugs! 

So, as long as I keep rebuilding, it  like I can do this, like I have the ability to choose again, which is quite amazing.

All in all, would totally recommend to anyone looking for an aid in getting clean. I feel I may have leapfrogged about 4 months of clean time, past the depression, insecurity, worry and come out the other side more solid in my recovery.

Any questions, I would be happy to answer.
7 years as an addict that has lost everything, relationships, friends, property, savings, everything I own I pawned.. its long enough for anybody. I really hope I don't 'choose' to go back, but right now, I feel like I have the will to choose and I am moving forward",1465495772.0

We started hanging out for a bit and one thing led to another and we had sex. A couple days later she moves in with me because she begs me over the phone how much she wants to quit and that she wants me to help her stay clean. Of course, a few days later she leaves my house to go meet this black dude for meth. They both come back high as shit and the guy offers me some H. I'm already drunk and I'm being piss tested on probation so I say no. I fall asleep on my bed with her and when I wake up, the guy has his shirt off and my girl is changing clothes. I'm assumed that she had sex with him for ice and she tells me they're going shopping and will be back mid day. Well she still isn't back and all I heard from her was ""im really sorry yo, i dont know whats happening"". I have no idea what that means, and tried to message her back but she hasn't been on fb in a few days. I honestly just wanted to meet up with her to fuck but ever since she moved in, I started actually developing real feelings for her and now I'm worried about her. I'm debating on breaking up with her the next time I see her, because I don't see this relationship going very well. Also, the guy she came back up stole my $200 headphones that I use for my computer and I'm really fucking pissed about that. I guess I'm just stupid for wanting a real relationship in this lifestyle...

I've moved away from my hometown to my uncle and started working where he works a few days ago. I really like my uncle and his daughter (my cousin obviously) but I'm so fucking bored. Work has kept me pretty occupied, it's pretty heavy labour. But just a few hours in on our free saturday I'm already bored out of my mind.

I want to get my musical creativity back. Writing and playing music was all that mattered to me before I got into drugs, and I keep fantasizing about a future where I can play music for a living. But when I pick up a guitar I just feel completely empty. Like, I've always felt like I am able to express myself emotionally through writing songs but even though I have a million emotions I want to express, nothing comes out.

I try to watch tv shows or movies but I just can't get into it. Watching football (""soccer"" for you yanks) and having a few beers with my uncle is alright but I'm never distracted enough to get out of my head. I'm just mulling over past mistakes, day dreaming about getting high, thinking about ordering off the dnm's when my paycheck arrives. I don't even know if I'm getting clean for myself or just for my family. I've hurt them so much this past year. 

I don't know, maybe it's just PAWS coupled with the depression from before I started to use. I just don't feel like I have a will to live. I've survived three attempts of suicide by OD and promised myself that I would try to do this, live here and work like a normal person no matter how shitty I feel but I'm already sick of it.

I don't know why I'm writing this, I guess I'm just really lonely. I burned a lot of friendships and I still miss my ex gf after 8 months of not having even seen her. I think I need to meet a girl, and get some friends. But it's not easy in this small, hick-town where everyone's bigoted, racist, sexist and no one has a sense of fashion or acceptable music taste.

We'll see how long this sobriety lasts. Probably not much further than the arrival of my next paycheck. Sorry for such a shitty shit post, I just really like this community and I'm super lonely and down right now.",1465654260.0

Thing is, I need fucking money for rent in like 5 days. A flake of a friend bailed on me yesterday with the majority of my rent money. 

I'm willing to do pretty much anything for money not to get evicted (nah I won't take a dick in the ass, thanks though. Other kinky things, that's definitely up for debate as long as it's legal. I'm down to pee on whomever). I'm a dude, are there are services I could post there? I know one of my female friends used to sell her old panties, is there anything of the sort I could do as a male?

I've never bothered with pills as I was introduced to h before pharms. But m dboy recently went ghost (have to go way out of my way to get anything now bout 4 hours) and all i can get in my area is Dilaudid. Or so one of my friends says. Well he charges 40$ for an 8 so I never bother as I might as well use 20 of that to get where i need to go for dope but I was sick as fuck and figured why not. But anyways, I bought a half from him. 4mg. I posted recently asking how much I should do and that seemed ti be a good dose. It was a white pill. Circle. (not an alien head like I used to seeing so i was worried.) He broke it in front of me and actually used the other half. Now again I have no experience with this. He told me to crush it up and back load it into my eig and then suck water in and shake. Thats exactly how he was doing it so I figured if es doing it that way it must work. So I mix it up and everything and it's clear but there's like a white film almost floating in it. I ask if itd supposed to do that as I know filtering is KEY with pills and he says it's fine that it's supposed to do that. He shoots his and as far as i can tell he enjoys it. (Now i also want to add he doesn't seem to use nearly as much as i do. We buy about the same amount an mines gone In a day as apposed to his 3.) So I figure ok it must not be bunk. I proceed to register and shoot. Now i can feel it almost traveling down my arm. I shoot in the crook and i could feel almost a cold liquid about 3 inches up my arm as im shooting (towards my heart not away) so I know it's going in. Finish the whole shot and nothing. Not a rush like it's been so heavenly talked about so I got mad. I asked why I didn't feel anything and he said he doesn't know he said he feels it. So whatever I give him the 20$ and yea im a little upset but this dude is cool. He's actually a friend. I buy subs from him he buys dope from me we make trips together and cop he hooks me uo with dealers in different areas I give hi customers etc. Were cool. So I'm nit too mad about it if it's bunk it's nit his fault he got it from his friend and sold it to me but like I said he seemed to like it. 

So I guess READ PAST HERE IF YOURE LAZY

so I get out and I start walking home. And about 5 minutes pass and my sickness is gone. Im not throwing up or sweating anymore. I feel fine. So I guess my question to everyone is was my tolerance too high? 4mg seemed to be what everyone said to go for and i couldn't see myself just NOT having a rush because of tolerance. Was I giving bunk? It was definitely something because I went from wd to fine. Do he lie about the dose? It was a circle white pill it looked like it had a line down the middle. I should have asked to see the whole thing first. ",1465634765.0

Me and my Dgirl are cool she has always been cool with me so no complaints on my end.

The Dgirl (we'll call her W) works on dealer time like every other dealer I hear about so of course she is taking forever. I'm chilling in my car outside the apartment, just a young white dude in the not so great part of town.

In my experiences throughout the years I have never cold copped our had any dealers single me out or come up to me, like I hear happens when you are in one of these parts of town, until today.

I have been akwardly been sitting in my car at this point for about a half hour (after W said I'll be right out 25 minutes ago) and this Black guy (not trying to be racist just describing) comes up to my passenger window. He seems a little nervous, but he says ""you waiting on someone?"" And I say ""yeah they will be out in a minute. He replies ""who you waiting on?"" Still looking me over cautiously. ""I'm just waiting on..."" And kind of point at the building not wanting to drop W's name (I don't know the rules of dropping dealers names to potentially another dealer.

The man (call him M) says ""alright"" and kind of starts walking away. He doesnt get very far before he turns and says ""you sure you don't need anything?"" And walks back toward me. At this point I'm a little excited but at the same time W has always been good to me so I'm not trying to bail on her, but I've only ever bought from her so I'm a little pumped just to try something different. I say ""why, what do you got?"" Which apparently was the wrong thing to say and must have screamed cop because M noped the fuck out saying ""Nah man"" and he turns and walks away.

Shit I just blew my chance to try new dope. I watch M walk away slightly disappointed when suddenly he walks into W's apartment and she walks out. Apparently he works for her so I wouldn't have had new dope regardless. How is it that the one and only time I almost cold cop it would have been the same shit?

I've discovered and intereting way to find new veins that you can't othweise see or feel. It allows you to see then nearly perfectly; you can seet their size, shape, what direction they're going.. Anything you could possibly need to know. Best of all it, the only requirement is somehing many of us already have! A smart phone! I personally have an iPhone 5s and it works wonders 

#**THE METHOD**
I have all that intro for a method that rakes two sentences to explain.

Use your smartphones flashlight feature turns on the front cameras flashbulb. That bright as fuck LED that flashes when taking a pic with flash. Turn that shit on in flashlight mode as bright as possible if you're able to adjust it.

Go in a dark room. Bathroom with no windows works fine. Close the door so it's pitch black. Press the Flashlight LED against your skin (obviously it has to be turned on). Don't press it hard, just it enoufh so that little light is escaping.

Run it around the areas you want to try and find veins in. You gotta go all around and at all diff angles. If looking at your fingers you gotta put the light on both sides. Veins that are too close to the LED will be overpowered by the light and now show up. But ones like a centimeter away from the actual LED but still very well within the illuminated area of your skin should show up. That's why you gotta move the light all around and at diff angles to make sure your missing anything.

#ADDITIONAL USEFUL INFO

I've used it everywhere. Works fucking wonders on fingers, you'll find some tiny as veins that don't roll that you'd have never seen otherwise. I found some deeper ones on side of wrist... All sorts of places I thought FOR CERTAIN were dead and barren of any veins.

This has to be done in the dark for obvious reasons. But obviously trying to hit in that darkness is hard. So often I just find the veins in the dark room then open the door to some light to be able to hit accurately.

More often than not I'll actually but holding my phone against the area/vein I'm trying to hit WHILE I'm shooting there. It's super fucking hard to hold phone in and hit at same time (try it). But that way you don't have to like mark where the vein is for when hjk leave to somewhere with more light, or just trying to remember wher it was at and what direftion it went. Keeping the phone pressed there also allow you to see if the vein moved/get pushed by the needle when entering skin, allowing you to make adjustments as needed with the direction of the needle.

If you have any questions or comments let me know.

#LET ME KNOW YOUR RESULTS!

If you are a person who literally could not find a vein to hit even after chugging water and a hot shower, I want to hear if this helped you find something. I know for a fact that this method can help you find veins that you can't see from the surface or really feel.",1465592800.0

I have been feeling strange in the head not nodding at all, cold yet sweaty limbs but my core and head feel very hot. I checked my temp and it is normal or just above. I am not sure if this related to what I consumed of panic attack because I am prone to it.

Essentially at the end of may, I was getting some fire #4, occasionaly a day of fentanyl, and otherwise mantaining on 200-300 mscontin every 12-24 hour, as I quit methadone 9 weeks ago (maybe it was 8?) at 45mg and went through a lot of hell substituing morphine at rediculous doses.

My arms were looking beat and weren't hitting and after must frusteration and a few spots that are what the doctor calls hematomas/sterile abscesses or maybe just loads of scar tissue, which hurt slightly when pushed on and the docs say ther eisnt much they can do...

So I decided to go for the hands, I figured, just about every other junkie does it, can't be that bad, right? I knew theres lots of nerves, and more easy to hit an artery, so I had my fears. WEirdly enough, everything went smooth, except for a few small veins that really didn't pan out easy (may of even bursted trying to push in too quick, but I learned..)

anyway, I found near the C from the index to thumb a great vein on each hand that has been doing me :). 

But the reason for this post (sorry, in some shitty wds so typing is scattered) I did miss on both hands slightly with clean dope that went down immediately within 30-60 mins, almost 2 weeks ago, 

Theres a slight red faded mark that remains, but the really worry for me is honestly the fact that the skin when its taunt / moved, some ways I can bend my hand in weird positions (I have full range of motion), I feel a painful striking nerve pain. Poking around I've always scattered by nerves in the arm or even went through them if the pain was minor, and they never left me with ever lasting damage. Well from my research the fourth and fifth finger which this affects, is the median or ulnar nerve I believe.

The reason I find this odd is that the pain didn't begin till a few days after the injection on the right hand, and nearly two weeks for the left hand. It's a nerve, that creates a fork (could it be this valve i've read about in forked veins blown?), over a tendon, readers, if you look at your hand and see at the fourth and fifth fingers a juicy vein that forks and begins slightly below the fourth fingers knuckle and travels along the tendon, that's where i'm referring

see:

I use dnm but I honestly hate it, it's such a pain in the ass and I hate waiting days on end.

BUT I just came across a nice opportunity.  My favorite new coke dealer (tough as nails old lady pushing 70 -- love her) just also happens to get a script for OP 20s every month.  Well she just told me she doesn't need them at all, and since she's taken a liking to me, she'll sell me her whole script each month.  Or whatever amount I want.  OP 20s aren't super exciting.. but beggars can't be choosers and I'll take a steady stream of these happily.

My question is regarding pricing since I would be buying in larger quantities.  The amount varies each month (I think it depends on the doctor that see's her that day), but it's usually between 60 - 120 pills.  She sells them for 20 a pop when you buy like 10 but obviously it shouldn't be that much if I'm buying a lot more.  But what is a fair price?

We got pretty close over the last 2 years. He was always careful about never shooting up. To my knowledge he never did.

He last text me Saturday,  looking to score. I told him I couldn't help him. Apparently he found some anyway. 

Im not sure if drugs were involved,  waiting to hear back still,  but I'm almost positive it was a fatal mix of benzos and fent laced dope. 

Im so sad. Fuck,  I'm so sad. He'd text me when I'd make a post here,  asking if I was okay. Every time. 

Now,  I'm not okay.

*For those of you that don't know. This is an ongoing series that I've written about my past drug usage, MM'ing, and drug dealing. It started out on /r/opiates, but I now have all the stories on my own subreddit /r/Critical386 - and it was suggested that I post here instead since not all of my stories involve opiates, but they do almost all involve drugs. I hope you enjoy!*

So this story is about a friend of mine, we'll call him Mark, and this story took place a few months ago.

Mark was from Boston originally, was living in Florida at the time, and in his own words, was *""wicked smaht""*, especially when it came to computers or programming. He devoured programming books like whores devour dicks. But Mark also had a small problem with opiates. Like most of us, he started out by getting a legit script of Lortabs. After realizing what a wonderful high it was, he was addicted and he didn't even know it.

He found a connection for blues, and he stuck with those until his girlfriend realized he was spending all of their money. He called me and told me to come over, as his girl was gone. So I come over and we both get to the bedroom and he has 10 roxies on a plate. He then pulled out a couple of syringes, and picked the best looking one (which wasn't in great shape).

I was taken back, as I thought all he was doing was snorting a pill or two here and there, and now he's asking me to shoot 60mg, all at once. I asked him what he normally does, and he said 1 at a time, but he wants to get really fucked up. I told him that I would do 45mg, find the vein and register, but he has to push the plunger. He agreed.

We get to talking, and he says he wants to do heroin. I told him it's not like the blues or Lortabs, because you never know how potent it can be, and some even has fentanyl in it. He said he already ordered some off of the DNM's, and some more syringes and Narcan (the syringes and Narcan both came from the same seller, but a different seller than the heroin). I told him to wait for me when he gets it, and not to do it before he gets the syringes.

A few days go by, and he tells me he got the heroin, but hasn't gotten the syringes or Narcan yet - I told him it will only be a day or two and he'll get them. He then said that he broke up with his girlfriend and she was moving out, so he's at the house by himself. I told him to just do some blues, and I’d be over tomorrow.

The next day I texted him that I’m coming over, but I didn’t get a response, which wasn't that unusual for him. I didn’t think anything of it, and just headed over there. I get to his house and I see that his car is there, so I know he's home. I open the door and yell for him - no response. I look around the house and I don’t see him, still yelling his name as I’m walking around. Not a peep. I head for the bedroom, taking notice of the huge amount of dirty plates and cups by the side of the bed, where his girlfriend would’ve NEVER allowed. That’s strange. I took a quick look into the bathroom, but didn’t see anything.

At first.

I looked to the floor, and there he was. His motionless body, slumped over.

I quickly call 911, and when I touch him, he’s cold. The paramedics arrived and said he’s probably been dead for a few hours. I look through a window, and I can see the mailman delivering the mail outside. I know what’s inside that package. The syringes and Narcan - just a few hours too late.

Last night I took my dose at 11pm and by 1am I was nodding hard as hell. I literally spent the next two hours teetering between being awake and sleep/dead(?) until somewhere around 3:30 am I felt confident enough to sleep without thinking I'm going to die in my sleep. 

I upped my dosage by like 20% about a month back because my tolerance just wasn't allowing me to feel anything. The upping of the dosage worked well enough to get me high so I stuck with it. i would think if the dosage was too high and I was going to be nodding and drooling on myself it would have happened then but it didn't ... it's happening now... a month later. I don't feel as high as I did a month ago but now I'm nodding every time i dose (3 times a day) for a good hour or two. I spend a huge chunk of my day fighting that feeling as it scares the shit out of me and I honestly think I might die if I just ""let go"". 

The obvious answer to this problem is to lower my dosage and quit soon which is what I'm doing starting today. I'm just curious to know if anyone else has experienced this before.

I do anywhere from 10 or 12 up to 20 - 30s a day - my girl roughly the same. My days are long - usually up early am 7am-10am and won't sleep until 4/5/6/or later some times. We don't do d0pe - I never have and have no desire too.
I know of people ordering other pharma/meds from overseas manufactures like china and it always looks suspect. the thing is the batches I get never look sus at all. the ppl i deal with know I'm good money and spend money daily and know if i have any issues i won't deal w them ever again - i don't think they got them intentionally thinking they were bootleg (if they are) - again they always look 100% legit.. I was thinking that one of my guys may have grabbed it from someone thats getting them from one of these internet pharm/doc things maybe? I mean I will get an average of 20-30 30s a day from him and he's always good - never on empty. maybe a day or two here and there that he's not. they have to come from somewhere. 
sorry for the rambling - 
am I crazy? 
I know some companies 30s or 15s seem stronger than others sometimes - (i usually prefer a215 over k9) thats not really what it feels like tho.. Im probably not articulating this as best I can. Its been a long day infant of computer screens.
Has anyone ever delt with over seas distributers or mexi pharms or any of these places that promise you actual real prescription meds w no docs note or any issues?
are these the type of places the bootleg roxis that supposedly contain fentanyl come from? 
any way to tell aside from just the usual visual touch/feel/texture identifiers?

Sorry I know this thing is a spelling/format/grammatical mess. Its too late to turn back now.I won't be sad if its deleted.
Thank you all.

Shit post from Day 8.,"It's Day 8 and that was a very important realization for me. I expected a few days of increasing symptoms, a few days of decreasing symptoms, followed by return to normalcy. And I guess that's how WDs worked when I dabbled with low doses. But now I'm coming off a big habit. And there's no ""day # out of the woods"". 

My body temperature is relatively stable. I can't sleep for shit even with ambien and another sleeping pill. I'm getting 3-5 hours a night and maybe a 1-2 hour nap. Everyone I talk to about my sleep says not to nap (they just think it's sleep trouble- not WD), but I will take ANY sleep I can get.

I'm still having anxiety attacks and I'm out of xanax, but they're getting better.

My appetite is better, but still not great. I'd probably be better off if I was eating more.

I'm drinking alcohol again (after Day 5) and maybe that's not helpful. 

The only thing that's really breaking me down is the sleep. That's something that slowly drags you into insanity- especially when the other symptoms are gone and it's just you awake at 3am. When I was up with hot flashes and aches at 3am I at least understood.

I'm just understanding it's a long road back to normalcy. Little steps- not some 6 day diet.

But the bottom line is I am 8 days clean. That is real fucking progress. I'm kind of exiled with no sources for two more weeks. I just hope by then I will feel no need to shovel that blue gold up my nose. 

Hope everyone else is doing well today- or as well as they want to be!",1465722193.0

Burroughs was a 40-50's author and heroin addict who spent a lot of time getting high in Tangiers (and some other places) and then writing about it, I'm curious to see if people who've read it feel like it's relatable or not.

Sample quotes: ""A junky runs on junk time. When his junk is cut off, the clock runs down and stops. All he can do is hang on and wait for non-junk time to start. A sick junkie has no escape from external time, no place to go. He can only wait.""

""Why does an addict get a new habit so much quicker than a junk virgin, even after the addict has been clean for years? I do not accept the theory that junk is lurking in the body all that time - the spine is where it supposedly holes up - and I disagree with all psychological answers.

I am prescribed tramadol and norco for a degenerative synovial fluid condition in my knee (among other things. My knee is fucked.) I enjoy tramadol for lots of reasons and feel it really is better for legitimate and chronic pain. I also love norco for the same reasons everyone loves norco. When it was legal, I used alot of kratom to make my tramadol and norco last longer.

An observation that I've tried too many times to be a coincidence is tgat while tramadol and kratom seem to work together and potentiate each other to a place where neither could get alone, kratom seems to block the effects of hydrocodone to a similar degree that it increases the tramadol. Also, tramadol and hydrocodone together seem to potentiate somewhat (while changing the experience qualitatively ) but not to the degree tramadol and kratom do.

But, I'm definitely NOT saying that I know for a fact that that cig caused this feeling in my tongue.

Wds are minimal so far, and I have a lot of self control so I will stop before it gets too bad. Besides, I have 84 reasons I can't get addicted.

What books do you all like? I read everything. Just finished ""where the money is"", a book written by an FBI agent who spent his career investigating bank robberies. Excellent read. Before that it was "" how can you defend those people"", a good read written by a criminal defense attorney. It was a very insightful look into the US justice system, and a look into the world of the lawyers we often need.

I read morbos books and Tracy's book. They were very entertaining. I strongly reccomend them.

I like books about fringe elements of society, I read a lot of Ginsberg, Burroughs, Kerouac, etc. growing up. I liked 1984 and animal farm, most of Huxley's work, Vonnegut's work and Kafka growing up too. Writers of these nature strongly appeal to me.

It happens. Some are better at controlling it, some are very... well, *ungraceful*, to say the least. 

Guess I'll start it up. On Fridays, Smoothie King has a $5 medium sized deal. Everyone pitches in their cash and I go pick them up, getting a freebie for making the drive. Well, apparently I overdid it on the powder earlier in the day; I felt great, but not noddy or anything. I happily drank my smoothie throughout my shift thinking nothing of the little rumbles and tremors building in my stomach. If anything, I may have to drop a log at work (which I hate doing) but the rumbles where mild and i figured I can wait til Im at home. 

Boy was I wrong. Once I made it home I realized it wasnt my ass I had to worry about. As most of you know, dope-nausea is absolutley dreadful. Suddenly my mouth was salivating and i knew that some up-chuck was in my immediate future. ""Well, this shouldnt be so bad..."" I think to myself as I prepare to get hunched over the toliet... I only had the smoothie for breakfast and since it was delicious I figured the vomit wouldnt be as terrible as say, dinner at taco bell vomit. 

It was by far, the worst thing Ive ever had to puke. The first few squirts were liquidy and cold (COLD!! Its a bizarre feeling to vomit cold stuff)... the little chuncks of fruit getting stuck in your teeth, but the worst part was at the end. It was all the powder stuff they add to the smoothies. Only it was more of a paste. Like really dry thick oatmeal that sticks to everything... coming up from your stomach and getting stuck at the back of youre throat, which caused me to gag. Trying to get that last bit out was just awful. Just... awful. So no more smoothies for this guy when theres certain drugs in his system.

I have been in pain management for several years for a long list of medical problems and chronic pain. I have my monthly appointment with him on Thursday to refill my medication, and he only makes me give a urine sample every 4 or 5 months or so. I have been on MS Contin ER for about two years now. It works wonderful, and I don't take anything for breakthrough pain. At my appointment on Thursday, I think it will probably be time for me to give a sample. I have a couple of lortabs given to me by a family member who received them for a leg injury, and no longer needed them. They gave them to me because they  'figured I could use them.'

Now, as I said, I am not looking to jeopardize my pain management contract, but just out of curiosity I was wondering, how do lortabs and MS Contin ER show up on a drug test for pain mgmt? Are they classified as opiates only, or do they show up in individual markers?

you guys are probably my rescue. I can imagine that probably daily **pops** a thread like this here, but I seriously have no idea.

English isn't my native language, it can be that (besides that my grammar and the syntax is completely trash) I swap words, because all I just run all those terms from my native language (Russian) into the translator and see what comes out (But I google it too.).

Today I found a poppy, but probably trash like that poppy without any opiates. I currently have only one [small blurry picture of it](http://i.imgur.com/cZZOVYS.jpg) but tomorrow I'll make specific pictures with higher resolution and more light. I just quickly photographed it so a friend of mine can identify it, he told me it's really opium poppy but my knowledge about it disagrees.

I already tried to identify it with Google, but only on my native language and I didn't found shit. Also sadly is my English way to bad to understand it.

The blossom / bloom was red, like bright red, not pinkish. As you can see in the picture, the stem is kinda prickly, the top purple and when I cut it white tough liquid passes out.

I cut them around an hour ago (10pm), I'll just wait to the very next day, wait for it to harden, scrap it off and repeat.

I can imagine that this post will probably fall deep into the oblivion of downvoted threads, but I'm just a heroin addict who gets fucked with a steel dildo with fucking razor blades by the government and its shitty laws.

If someone is really about to help me, please tell me which parts to photograph.

Thank you in advance!

I started doing heroin recently. I IV at most once a day, usually once every two days, but sometimes I shoot two or even three times. However that happens only when I screw up somehow, or when the dose is too low. I also snort during day, as an anti anxiety measure. Not quite as effective as alcohol, it nevertheless does a good job of loosening my tongue and preventing panic attacks.

As a result of my frequent usage I already built up a tolerance and, oh joy, physical dependence. Somewhat. A little bit. I did a test a few days ago. I stopped using and experienced very mild withdrawal symptoms. Really nothing earth shattering, mostly just anxiety and discomfort, with a sprinkle of flu symptoms. Not enough to take a sick day, but enough to ruin my day and irritate the hell out of me.

If I wanted to quit it would be quite easy right now, alas I don't want to quit. However due to some unexpected circumstances I will have to temporarily stop using. My stash is running very low, I got like two hits left and I am right now in a very hectic period, without money, starting a new job, moving, etc. etc. basically for almost six weeks I will be heroin free whether I want it or not.

Now as I said, I got only very mild WDs, I could handle it cold turkey, but what I wanted to ask the experienced users here is, is there a better way? Can I wean off slowly, by lowering and spacing out my shots, perhaps? I could theoretically get maybe even six shots out of my stash if I were more conservative. It wouldn't get me high, but maybe it would lower the withdrawal effects. Would that make the WDs even less of a nuisance?

Another thought I had was to pass the uncomfortable times with another, non-opioid, drug. Now I don't think it would stop the withdrawal since they act on different receptors and such, but it may psychologically help. I happen to have some speed, cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine available. And of course there is always good old fashioned booze. Since I don't suffer nausea during WDs yet, alcohol might be a valid choice.

Such a long post for such a simple question (I tend to do that, I noticed). How to minimize the effects of mild heroin withdrawal. Also, preemptively, I would like to ask people to stop suggesting I quit. Yes I know it's going to destroy my life. I believe you and I still want to do it. I may change my mind in the future, but it's not gonna be because of some internet strangers, it's gonna be because of my parents tears.",1465850017.0

I don't use opiates personally, but I have a friend who has been using heroin for the past several years. She came down to my city to visit and asked me if I would like to accompany her to some random suburban town so that she could get her fix. 

I'm not the type to judge, but as we made the bus ride up north, I continuously told her to stop using, for she was better than heroin. I begged her to just turn around, but she said she needed it. So I relented and shut up after a while. 

We got off the bus in a suburban neighborhood and walked a mile. Eventually, we stop at this house with a well-manicured lawn. I follow her into the house. The front door was unlocked. 

The house was a pigsty. Trash and crap were strewn everywhere. There also wasn't anyone there (my friend told me that her junkie friend would keep it unlocked for her). 

We go upstairs into her friend's bedroom (her friend was at work). Inside, there was this baggie with some brown powder on the dresser. 

I narrowed my eyes. ""So, I assume your friend isn't giving you any freebies...""

She opened the bag and poured a bit of the powder out. ""Nah, I just have to suck his dick every so often.""

""How are you going to do it?"" I didn't see any needles.

""I snort. Scared of needles.""

Using her fingers, she created two brown lines. She pulled out a $1 bill and rolled it. Using that, she inhaled the two brown lines of stuff. 

A few minutes passed. Her eyes relaxed, the color returned to her cheeks.

""You okay?""

She tilted her head back. ""Yeah. I can go to the party now.""

We headed to a birthday party in the neighboring town. She left a couple of minutes after saying hi to the birthday boy. (She needed to go back to the house we were at to return the favor to her junkie friend.)

The next morning, I get a text from my friend. She overdosed while doing more heroin at her friend's place. Luckily, her friend had was able to rush her to the hospital a few blocks away. They gave my friend narcan and she recovered. They also told her that she had traces of fentanyl in her system - the heroin she was using had been cut with fentanyl. 

I was relieved, but I was firm.

""Promise me, promise me, that you won't use heroin ever again.""

I couldn't see her face, but I got a reply a few minutes later.

""I promise.""

I hope she keeps her promise, but as they say, use once, use always...

**TLDR: Accompanied my friend and watched her snort heroin. Later that night, she overdoses, largely because the heroin she had been snorting was laced with fentanyl. It was her first overdose, and she promised she that she would never do heroin ever again.**",1465846155.0

My cancer has metastasized; it's officially stage 4 now. I started taking opiates during recovery for surgery to cut my tumor out 2 years ago. Since then, my dose has steadily escalated since opis help numb both the physical and mental pain that has confined me to bed most days. I'm only 29 years old, and now, there's chances of me surviving this cancer are very slim. In addition to being stage 4, it's a super rare type of cancer so advances aren't being made on the same pace as the more common types like lung cancer. I wish I was a more spiritual person, but I'm bitter that God has dealt me this hand. I worked my ass off to get where I am in life: college, law school, and the unique hell that is working as a junior associate in a boutique firm whose life-blood is billable hours. I never pressured myself to online date or settle for less than amazing guys, because I always figured I'd find someone when the stars aligned and the time was right. 


Now, I'm realizing that time may never come and I could die single and childless. But even that realization pales in comparison to the other things I wanted to do during my lifetime: volunteering for lawyers without borders, traveling throughout Asia, going to Oktoberfest in Munich, rekindling things with my European ex-BF I met while studying abroad, learning to speak Russian, serving my country as a JAG lawyer... So many things left undone. I will never give up my fight against cancer so that I can maintain a glimmer of hope that I'll, one day, make these things happen. 


Still, in the mean time, rx pills are keeping me sane. Started with 5mg percs... Now I'm up to 6 blues per dose, 5 doses per day. And actually, that's down from 10 blues per dose. I also allow myself one splurge dose per day--8 blues plugged. I forced myself to taper bc I was getting neither high nor pain relief from my ridiculous doses. I can at least feel my dose now, however slight the buzz may be. 



Anyway, on to the real point of my post: I'm thinking of escalating to shooting, H, or both. I bought all the supplies to shoot my blues (wheel filters, luer lock syringes, sterile water), but haven't taken the ""plunge"" yet. I guess my biggest worry would be that I develop track marks that my doctors notice and cut off my rx. Is it possible to have nearly invisible tracks with good, sterile technique? I'm less interested in H due to the possible contaminants, but nothing is off the table at this point. If I tried H, it'd have to be the purest shit I could possibly fine--probably off DNM, which I've never used before. I'm also considering shooting fent, since I have about 100 patches of various dosages laying around. Actually, now that I think about it, I've got dillies and morphine sulfate to shoot too. I tried plugging these, but they didn't do anything so they've just been chilling in my pill box (ok it's actually a huge rubber tote box full of random meds).


If you were in my shoes, which drugs would you do with which ROAs? Can you think of any potential backlash I should be aware of? I just want to enjoy my opis like I used to when I had no tolerance. Money is no object; can't take it with me and it's not like I have kids to take care of. I'd appreciate any insight y'all could give. Thanks family.

Damn. I usually don't mind giving the guy a bag as he picks up daily so always knows who's good, and I get to wait at his place rather than on the corner.  
Hopefully it'll cook up ok, if not I guess it just reinforces why I don't use much anymore.

Its been a fukin crazy few years. Lots of dead friends, lots of sick friends, multiple raids, lots of charges, been in the news twice haha (Yeah, I'm a badass :), court ordered detox, luckily no jail time thanks to my crafty lawyers and me pleading guilty in return for a reduced sentence. But I am on my last chance now for real so I have started to pull my head in a bit.  


After the last time I got my bedroom door kicked in by the drug squad rolling in with machine guns, I decided to put an end to my hustling ways and keep it to occasional use. I still love a good binge when I have absolutely nothing to do, but I dont miss the headfuck that is involved with moving dirt. I make my cash in legitimate ways these days so I don't really need to commit more crime.    

I have just started to study youthwork and I am hoping to work with the younger generation of crackheads and fiends to help out them out of the gutter.

You guys are so self aware and caring to people you don't even know and it's really great to see especially since addicts are so often marginalized and isolated from society.   

What I'm trying to say is that although I am not a user, I identify with a lot of the feelings and experiences I see on here and am glad this community exists. Sorry for tha feels but it was just something I thought I needed to say...",1466000238.0

It's not something I'm proud of but we are finding it so hard to stop. We stopped for 3 days and got so sick, runny nose, cold sweats, nausea, upset stomachs, you name it. We just went and borrowed money from my partners sister to go and get a box of 40 pills just to stop the sickness which makes me feel like such a junkie. 

Our plan after today is to get alcohol and weed and go cold turkey off the codeine but use the weed and alcohol to help with the withdrawal symptoms.

I just don't even know how we ended up here, it started off as something we did every couple of weeks then we came into a bit of money and went on an 8 day binge and since then it just got out of control. 

It's gotten to the point where we have been barred from some chemists for buying too much codeine and have been pharmacy shopping. We've also been doctor shopping to get panadeine forte scripts. It's just junkie behaviour and I feel ashamed.",1465967702.0

I was a daily oxycodone addict from 19-23, a black tar heroin addict for about 6 months, and then switched to prescription suboxone for 2 years from 24-25, to escape all that madness. 

I've been off suboxone for about 95 days now. I have relapsed on east coast heroin 5 times since quitting. This past weekend I got ahold of some very fire Baltimore raw. 

I guess what I realized on this last relapse is that I don't really like the opiate high anymore. I felt a similar feeling of disappointment on the first 4 relapses but I thought it would be different this time because it was raw Baltimore dope that everyone loves. It did feel good. But I guess I just don't like to nod anymore. I also don't like being high in front of my new sober friends, and I don't like all the goofy shit I say when I'm high in dope. It's almost like dope releases this manic side of personality, that I'm not normally like. I'm usually a really laid back dude but when high on dope I feel mentally insane. Like the little shit will set me off and im not normally thet way 

I do not do AA or NA at all and I am not anti-drug at all. I have been drinking red wine daily the past 60 days. Usually go through a bottle every 3 days. I don't smoke weed because it makes me socially anxious. I really really want to do MDMA again, to feel the good feelings of love and openness. Opiates don't give me those good feelings anymore. 

So I guess my question is, am I alone here? Has anyone else lost their appetite for opiates? I used to be obsessed with opiates. Addicted daily for 6 years if u include subs. But now, I don't like the chase for the high anymore and the high itself isn't what it used to be. I guess I just love my normal, non-addicted life now. It's a lot of fun having friends and dating again. I don't need opiates to mute my true being anymore. I love who I am and want drugs to open me up to the world, not shut me down.

Last night my girl and I are hanging in my room, shooting up. Nothing new.

I keep shouting her name and she barely responds with actual words and I run up to her and lift her up, she isn't responding really at all. I am shouting her name through tears at this point, I lift her up to put her on the bed and she is still breathing but very sparsely, and sometimes made a horrible gasping noise. I was going to take her to the hospital myself but was too fucking scared so I called 911and they walked me through it until the paramedics came. Her lips started to go blue, I swear I fucking killed her. After being on the phone with paramedics for about5 minutes she starts to come to very out of it. Color back in lips and everything.

And to think. She was gonna meet my son for the first time in 6 weeks. Fuck.

I'm a long term opiate user. I've been going back and forth between getting clean and using for like 13 years. I keep thinking someday I'll win. But I feel like you cannot win. When I'm sober, I hate it. I'm emotional, sensitive to everything, anxious etc. My meds don't even hardly help. But when I'm using I feel better short term but nothing haS been resolved and my problems are still there. So I ask, what's the fucking point? There is no pot of gold waiting for me. I work everyday just to be a fucking debt slave or when I'm using I'm a dope slave.  So what difference does it make? Why not just indulge? But then when I go on a binge, I feel bad, then I get clean only to feel worse. It's a terrible cycle. You know they say the definition of insanity is ""doing the same thing and expecting a different result""  if that's the case then I'm fucking insane. Sorry for the depressing post. Just how I'm feeling these days. ",1465924205.0
