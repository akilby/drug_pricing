And do you think it's unwise to use the urine with levels as low as 1-2 mg of bupe a day. I think they just test for a positive (not completely sure though) but will 1-2 mg be enough?**

Also I think everyone should start putting TL;DR's at the top of the post, ya know where everybody starts reading.


I have some clean pee from myself that I produced earlier this morning. It's sitting in the fridge right now. I also have another bottle in the freezer for any future drug tests in case it is needed. I have one concern however.

I have only been taking about a milligram or two of buprenorphine a day, yesterday I only took one. I don't think my doctor sends our urine in for lab testing but I'm scared if he does I'll get cited for having low levels of bupe in my urine. The bottle in the freezer is from when I was taking about 4-8 mg of bupe a day and it might be better to use that one but I'd rather not use it if I don't have to as I'd have to throw out the newer sample.


what do you guys think? Do you have any tips, this is my first time doing this but I think I have everything down. It's crazy, I'm pretty much clean right now and I'm a bit reluctant to throw it away too. Like clean off bupe (almost) and clean off H and I feel pretty alright tbh. The most normal sober me feeling, that feeling or mindset you haven't felt in a while when you've been using every waking hour for months. It's pretty crazy and I'm a bit reluctant to get back in the obsessive mindset that comes with H use.


.... I suppose I could flush what I just copped and stay clean, and really give it a try right now instead of getting back into this. I really do feel kinda okay, not the best but the best I have felt since I first got off of dope and onto bupe and I'm getting by on about a milligram a day.



Sorry for going off on a tangent, anyway my main question is, do all doctors submit patient samples for lab testing of buprenorphine levels in the urine? And do you think it's unwise to use the urine with levels as low as 1-2 mg of bupe a day. I think they just test for a positive (not completely sure though) but will 1-2 mg be enough?

Post here a lot. I do a lot of thirties with my girlfriend of 8 years. We met when we were 17 and started out drug journey together. I get her all her drugs. She's half my size yet somehow has twice my tolerance. Things between me and her have been rocky for a couple months. Mainly because she fuckin nods out anywhere and everywhere. I've seen her doing it in public. At our house (we live with her parents who have no idea we do drugs) so she could be getting us caught. She's killing my wallet having to buy so many per week. I would just break up with her but I fear her going fucking nuts and trying to kill herself.

So here is where it gets interesting. At my work I met a girl (26) who works in upper management who dabbles with thirties. She's got a low tolerance and actually buys me a couple when she asks me to get them for her. She's easily as hot as my girlfriend and is everything my girlfriend isn't. Driven. Already Successful. Great conversationalist. She's perfect.

So I was telling her about my relationship problems at work. We had just split a thirty in my car and were smoking butts. She turns to me and goes ""if you were single, I'd be blowing you right now..."" So I turned to her and my jaw dropped. She got out of my car and lifts up her skirt and shows me the sexy ass G string she had on. She goes ""this can be all yours tonight if you want.."". LIKE WHATTTTTTT I GOT INSTA-WOOD. Her ass was fucking perfect.

So the way I see it I have three options 
1. Dump my gf. Start banging new girl. 
2. Don't bang new girl, stay with gf.
3. Tell new girl I dumped my gf but not actually do it. Bang em both!

I'm going with option three for now. Keep hittin em with the 30 dick!!


EDIT: DUMPED GF. NEW GIRL IS FUCKING PERFECT. BEST DECISION EVER.

EDIT 2: I'm shocked by the number of you guys who told me not to cheat. For some reason I expected there to be less people with a heart in this sub lmao",1493640972.0

When is it safe to call asleep after taking oxycodone? I am having a hard time finding this out.. 

I love me some oxys, though I get a bit paranoid about falling asleep too close to taking a dose. I figured that the closer my sleep is to my dosing, then the more likely I will experience respiratory depression in my sleep.. this freaks me out! 

Since the half-life for for oxycodone is about 3.2 hours, I figured I'd start getting into the habit of not going to bed until its been 4 hours since my last dose. However, I thought perhaps I should push this 6 hours to get closer to two half-lives.

About 8 hours ago I dosed 30 mg, and 5 hours ago I dosed 25 mg.  I am trying to stay awake for one more hour, but damn its hard.. my eyes keep shutting and I dose off.. I have to pace around to keep awake! 

Anyways, yeah.. whats a good time to wait until I sleep after taking oxycodone so that I don't die in my sleep?

Just pure utter shame. The days when this whole thing was a chilling pass time are so hazy. I can mainly remember law trouble and working daily hard as hell for my money and never saving a dime. I over dosed two times the first time I woke up to my cousin who is my blood and best friend and also one of my long-time friends who is practically family  both crying looking over me sprawled out in a tub. I promised that was it. I went on a small binge during a month or so after during those days thatat fent was pretty much all you can get (this was fairly recent) and over dosed at the one place where I should have been on point. Hit me out of nowhere, and made a complete ass of myself. I still romantacise it all but over all at the end of the day you know what? I feel shame how could I have had such little respect for my self. I'm not bashing people who still use but it's a gluttones thing. Once your in your in but if I could of never gone to the big leagues I could have done more and most of all not live with the shame and guilt. Yes, I am  responsible for my actions but boi did I fuck up and shit this really is no joke. Too many people we have known have been lost. Most of us try and maintain a normal life and some of us can somewhat control it but these days I can't help like feel like dope is some fuck shit. Trying to work long shifts drinking bottles of imodium, crawling skin,wild mood swings/emotional disability, no sleep,sneezing, shitting the works...the looks you get from people. Its wack. It changes the persona. Makes you this character that is too comfortable for their own good. When it's gone it literally fucks you up. I'm glad I've been able to keep my distance. I don't post a goddamn thing really but this sub helped a bunch when I was off the shits, but now I would feel better if I could catch others on to that mentality. Smoking mad weed and keeping busy can suffice. I just worry about those who can't control their urges. Also being of Puerto Rican decent sucks cuz the sterotype is alive. 9 out of 10 junkies I know are Puerto Rican pan handlers with 0 shame and boast about what they just copped.  I just never understood how people can get into this and be about it. It always ends up sucking. Unless you're filthy rich and can do whatever you want and when withdrawal​ starts they have all thee means and no job so can go to a fancy rehab where a somewhat normal appearance is necessary. Trying to get buy as a below average Joe with a dope problem is too much. Well, ill end the rant with once again​ saying that it was a tiny fraction of my time using where I was into it. Trying to find the best work and now I just feel shame. I have a nice scar and it's haunting. Yea this is written poorly but I see all types of fucks writing stupid shit on Reddit so I figure it's my time. Peace. 
 if you read this cheers.

Every fucking time the same thing happens. I plan for it, do the last of my shit at night, throw all my gear away, look up an AA schedule, stock up on Kratom and vitamins and day dream about having regular relationships and friendships where I'm not sneaking off constantly to get high or backing out of plans but I'd rather stay home and get fucked up alone. 

I wake up in withdrawal and freak out a little bit and then wait and wait and wait until it's been as close to 24 hours as I can. Relapsing can make it hard to judge COWS symptoms. I'll be sweating and tearing up super bad, feeling kinda flu-y and definitely like I'm about to get sick, but with less severity than I would experience when coming off a heavier habit. 

So I sweat and shake and second guess myself and I get that FEAR, the fear that it won't work, that I'm permanently broken, that this is just who I am and I'll be like this forever. When I can't take it anymore, when the fear of precipitated withdrawal feels about the same as the fear of just cold kicking, I dose aaaaaaaaaaaand like 20 minutes later I'm TOTALLY FINE. No withdrawal symptoms, no fear, no freaking out. The reassurance that even if I used, nothing will happen. The reality that I could have done this days or weeks ago and I'd still have all that money and I wouldn't have lied to as many people. 

And I feel like a fucking idiot for relapsing in the first place. I wonder what this has all meant. And I know that this may be last time I ever go through all this bullshit, but it probably isn't because I've thought that so many times before. 

Detoxing without subs is so terrifyingly miserable (lord knows I've done it so many times and it never gets any easier) but with subs, it manages the symptoms so completely that I'm stuck pacing around my apartment like a normal ass person just completely fucking normal and it's so bizarre and disorienting. Like, half an hour ago I could barely get myself to the bathroom to shit and now I'm eating a big ass bowl of lentil soup and watching Futurama like nothing fucking happened. It's so weird and lonely. 

I don't know why I'm like this. I don't know why any of us are like this. Literally no one knows about my last relapse. I've been out of the program since moving cities. If I told my girlfriend she's probably break up with me. If I told my friends they'd see it as confirmation of their worst stereotypes. I'm completely by myself and I just wanted to say something.

I've been building this habit for over a year and I just got the opportunity to purchase some suboxone.  I was thinking of using it for 3-5 days to get over the worst of the WD symptoms then switching to kratom and lope.  What do you guys think?  I definitely have no desire to stay on suboxone for an extended amount of time so I want to make sure I don't get addicted to it.  I don't wanna trade one addiction for the other.  For context I have a good job that I can't miss and even though kratom and lope work to eliminate WD, they don't get rid of the MASSIVE cravings I have in the first few days of WD.  I have a beautiful, awesome wife and a 13 month old son who is everything to me and I HAVE to put this shit behind me.  So is the suboxone a good idea?  I only ask because I have tried with lope and kratom several times and I always find a way back to the pills because I am mentally fucking weak.  I'm determined to overcome that weakness this time but I'm going to take any help I can possibly get.  I'm desperate for a solution and I'm hopeful this is it.  I'm posting this tonight because the opportunity to procure the suboxone is tomorrow.  I was thinking 2 mg dose for the first couple days then one day each of 1.5 mg, 1 mg, 0.5 mg, and then go to kratom and lope.  Thoughts and advice would be greatly appreciated and if more information is needed don't hesitate to ask.  Thanks in advance!

I live about 20 to 25 minutes away from the big city where I always had to cop, from all my previous dboys, (about 7 of them haha) since I started, I have never copped anywhere else or in any other state, I tried in Ohio with very little effort because I brought shit, but that 2 day trip was to watch my brother in senior high school play on the Cleveland Cavaliers court, with a CAVS game being 2 hours after his. And I live in NY. 

Anyways my longtime dboy for almost every time I copped  since I had started literally walked ten or so minutes everyday to the biggest open air market street in downtown.  But about 2 months ago I quit going to him, I was his biggest customer going literally everyday sometimes 2 or 3 times a day and he never hooked me up or gave me deals or anything, fucking Called him Spanish Red, but when I got into trouble about a month and a half  ago and went to cop he gave me garbage, little Dope, little Fent, and it just sucked even worse although his shit had always been a 7 or 8; sometimes being straight from his main source being a fucking 10, best dope I had ever had! But even with like that first week and a half tolerance  break the few bags I snagged that were a little dope and a little Fent was just terrible didn't even get me high after having to snort 4 or 5 of the 7 I had picked up.I'd say they were at most a 4 and that's being generous as all can be, prior his buns were always $60 or when he tried to charge me $70, always paid $60 flat.

At some point down the road I was pulled over on a side street from Spanish Red sniffing his bags prior to getting in legal trouble, maybe 4 months or so ago and I had gotten a free sample and that was when I had started going to this newer guy who did $5 bags or $50 buns. He had a car and I guess I could've boosted items for buns but never had the chance to do so, well even with his car if I offered to throw him gas and pick up at least 3 buns at a time he wouldn't do it, had to always meet him in another part of downtown and he was always making me wait 20 minutes! Anyways I went to a movie tonight which is roughly 10 to 15 minutes away from my house and the new dboy in the big city, just about a halfway distance for both of us.

The story behind this dboy was I had met him waiting for the $5 dude roughly 2 or 3 weeks ago and he pulled up and offered some samples (2 boy & 2 girl). Well that same day I was messaging him letting him know I had his cell number and id hit him up whenevee I could. I also asked him a few otherbasic questions such as ""do you or could you hook me up with weight, I.E.- cost of 1G?"" The answer was yes for $160. I also asked ""would you deliver to my place if I was looking to cop higher amounts 3, 4 bundles, or a brick to make it easier ($200/5buns)."" Which his response to was yes also. So at this point I was mega happy to have found a cheap and reliable source for some quality dope. 

There is just one other thing I just don't quite understand. So if someone could shed some light on this predicament it would be much appreciated. -- So if costs $160 a Gram for Dope/Boy, and it's $200 a Brick (being 5 buns). Presumbly  if each bundle weighs between .25 to .5 (.5 short from the standard .1 a stamp then that's equaling 1.25-2.5 depending on what each bundle has inside. But for that $160 a gram then what the fuck is the best choice, copping a brick or a single gram?

Like I has mentioned above he had also sampled me out 2 Coke/Girl which I had asked about the cost of that too, inturn he said it was $100 a gram. Going back to tonight though as I apologize for carving into some key details and getting slightly sidetracked hehe, if someone could please try to get me a solid answer to that $200/Brick & $160/G it would be much appreciated. 

Anyways tonight roughly an hour before me and my buddy headed to the movies I asked if he would drive and meet me there at the movies. I figured it was highly unlikely considereing I only had $25 to work with but I'll be damned he fucking did it!  Unfortunately I couldn't pick up a bun like I really wanted to do. So I only got 4 & 1/2 bags for $25 because of the drive he made (10 to 15 minutes) which means I only missed out on 1.5 because his buns are $40.. anyways sniffed 2 throughout the movie (The Circle, I would gladly give the movie a solid 7/7.5 and would recommend to people to go see.) Also had about 4 or 5 beers since this afternoon and going fishing, I caught a good size Perch, Bullhead, and my buddy a monster Bass. Well I had also decided to smoke weed again one last time for quitting due to rehab and the ungodly long amount time that THC stays in the system! -_-. After fishing we grilled some heavenly good swiss cheese burgers with onion and steak sauce haha!  

Anyways I'm sorry for the extremely long post but I hope everyone had a wonderful day. **A quick little information update while I've been editing this post to space out the text to add  paragraphs and make it a little easier to read.** But while doing so I had finished my last bag and scrapped em all, went out to smoke a cigarette and then got a mild wave of nausea (that hasn't happened well at all really ever since I started (think I have always had a naturally high opiate tolerance) ..but I didn't end up throwing up or anything and the nausea had passed about 10 minutes after. 

Once again thank you everyone for taking the time to read this post and hopefully to answer my question. <HAPPY NODS my OpieBros! :D> Remember to be safe and test your doses. Much love all! :) .. my time to nod out now! Have a wonderful Monday my FAM.",1493612956.0

I once got invited, and went, to a house party in a rich neighborhood of Sacramento hosted by Brotha Lynch and including Tech N9ne, Keak Da Sneak, and E40 on the guest list. Keak brought two full CASES of the big pharmacy-only bottles of oxy cough syrup, Lynch brought several ounces of coke, and E40 brought more dro than we all could have collectively smoked in a year.

The party was absolutely incredible. The house was constantly hotboxed, like a thick fog had gotten trapped inside. We were constantly making ""purple drank"" with the oxy sizyrup and grape Fanta. E40 never left his spot on the couch; he was just hitting blunts nonstop and having bitches bring him purple drank, whiskey, and occasionally a fat rail of coke on his personal little mirror. Tech N9ne just smoked weed and took the occasional shot of rum while being a fuckin weirdo in his face paint and hitting on any chick who got close. Brotha Lynch was having as good a time as he could while trying to make sure his house didn't get *too* trashed. Keak Da Sneak, on the other hand, was living it the FUCK up. He always had a crowd around him (usually including me), and was constantly being the joker, telling hilarious jokes and anecdotes while having a guy he actually paid to roll blunts for him working nonstop so he was never NOT smoking. My favorite part was when he finished a story and yelled, ""LET'S DO SOME *FAT FUCKING LINES!!!"" At which point his blunt roller split up nearly an entire ounce into like 20+ massive lines, and we all took one. I had to split the damn thing up between both nostrils, it was so massive.

That's about when I questioned if this was really happening. ""Am I really helping Keak Da motherfucking Sneak kill an entire ounce of cocaine? I must be, because I'm fucking WIRED! Now, where the *fuck* is that oxy juice?""

 I woke up in an upstairs bedroom the next day with one other guy and four women, all of us naked, with no idea wtf even happened towards the end of the night and a condom still on my dick. I was one of the first couple people awake, and managed to make out with a bottle and a half of the syrup. :D Never saw anyone from that party ever again except for the coworker who invited me, and my best friend who was also invited. But I'll never forget it.",1493612875.0

> ""It has hardly —if at all any — heroin in it,"" Chevelday said. ""It is basically fentanyl, and they're saying that there could be some ketamine in it as well.""](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/overdose-spike-1.4006087)


**wow could even have ketamine in it what a treat LOL WAT i love me my ketamine but come on whoever touches these drugs doesn't really seem to understand normal business practices such as letting ur customer know what they're buying.**


> [W-18 is a powerful opioid 100 times stronger than fentanyl. It was previously discovered in Vancouver last April and also found in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
According to a release, Surrey RCMP seized pebble heroin in December 2016. The drugs were sent to Health Canada for analysis and recently came back positive for W-18.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/overdose-spike-1.4006087)

I find it incredibly hard to believe they are not for a recreational high and were tied off in the corner of a baggie- presumably fell out of someones pocket after doing laundry.  After asking some neighbors if they lost anything in the laundry room, I've ended up with these mystery pills.

I'm half tempted to just throw them away since I cant ID them for sure, but I feel theres a strong chance I have some opiates here.

Small white oval pills, no specks.. The inside of the pills are slightly more cream than white.  I SWEAR I could almost make out the impression of a faint cursive V on one, but I wonder if that's wishful thinking.

I took a taste and I think it tasted acetemetophan, but its been too long.

Based on my research, I feel like its mostly likely that these guys are hydro, muscle relaxers or for herpes treatment.. lol.  Possibly could be anything, but like I said.. the tied off in the baggy thing kind of tells me its very possbly hydro.

Input before i consume / trash mystery pills? How would you handle this?

I have no idea on the process of how I'm gonna pay for tuition but if there's a will there's a way. Now being the only kid in the family with high set goals, I do have a little problem just like the rest of my family. And I have a girlfriend who is so supportive of me. Got me out of hell and put me back in high school to achieve this goal. Now my family (a specific member who ""dearly loves me"" who's addicted to adderall and methadone) is practically trying to make my girlfriend who has high goals set too, leave me ""if this issue of mines gets too out of hand."" I've been staying at her house and doing the right thing. She's holding my Oxys and giving me a limited quantity of pills for the day and a plan to go along with it that we both agree upon. But to have my family trying to ruin our relationship kills me. I lost two parents I loved to drugs, I have no trustworthy family for support, only ""Family"" who tries to bring me down while being hypocrites in the midst of me putting most of my all in improving my life. Suffering with social anxiety and when I'm off my normal opiate dose, I can't open my mouth to argue back; I'm essentially passive. How do I deal with these horrible family members of mines? I'm the only one trying to do the right thing while they're running the street with three kids at home alone, 3am for adderall and throwing me under the bus because I use oxycodone to cope with this horrible anxiety and allow me to go to school/talk to people/work/etc... sobriety is difficult and to lose another love in my life I've been with for 4 years will kill me more.

TL;DR: I have high goals set that I'm going through with to become a physician, I don't know the true path to get there; I'm learning; I have a supportive girlfriend of my oxy use and she's helping me manage/taper; but I have hypocritical family members (worse than me) trying to get her to leave me. I have no parents; nobody but her: how do I deal with my ""family""?

The last year been anywhere from around 60-120 mg/day on average of hydrocodone, oxycodone or morphine, its usually a combination depending on what I have that week. Oral or snort, no IV. Sometimes more sometimes less if I'm broke. Have stopped a couple times and definitely went into pretty bad withdrawals. 
Went out of town on a work trip (5 days) and before I left the only thing I could get my hands on was 4 Suboxone pills and one strip. Had never taken Suboxone before but have been taking them past five days and nothing else. Took the last dose I have and headed home in a couple hours The subs have done nothing but make me feel pretty much normal the whole time. (Which is great for a work trip) Kinda Tired, but not high and not sick. 
I've been thinking about quitting. Is this a good starting point?  Will taking the subs have reduced my tolerance? I usually don't have access to them, I got lucky before the trip. What should I do when I get back to continue tapering?  I haven't taken the subs long enough to become addicted to them separately  right? How long after the last dose of sub what I need to take something to not feel crappy?

Last weekend, a friend told me that someone gave him 3 grams of ECP as payment for a debt. I was given a sample and it was absolutely just like I remembered it, from 20 years ago.

I bought more that same day and went back for more the next day. Then came Monday.. I knew that if I used on Monday, that would make three days in a row and I would be very close to physical dependence. I did it anyways.. and then Tuesday and Wednesday.. I ended up sick on Thursday morning and started a Kratom taper considering I have to work daily and can't miss time for being dopesick.

Needless to say, I'm ending my opiate career for the second time in my life. I actually went to a SMART Recovery meeting on Saturday and haven't used any opiates since, except for the Kratom taper. 2 more days and I'll be done with that as well.

I'm just about to take the next step in my relationship. I'm proposing to my SO this upcoming weekend and we're trying to have a baby. I need to be present in my life. Constantly wanting to escape responsibility definitely creates its own problems..

I will stick to my daily cannabis use and the occasional mushroom trip but I don't have the self control to use opiates/heroin responsibly so I am going to quit them all together.

BTW, I've been chipping for the past year. In my experience, it always catches up with you in the end.. Perfect example: I told myself that I would never use a needle again. I've had someone shoot me up multiple times in the past couple of months. This is after I finished a hepatitis C treatment and there is no more virus in my blood. Talk about insane behaviors...

We went to middle and high school together. We were inseparable homies. We shared our first joint together at 12, first beers together in the woods at 13, and had many other great times. Around the age of 16, Charlie got into oxy. I had actually started getting really into booze at the time, and wasn’t much into pills. About a year later when we were 17, I was drinking about 8-12 beers a night. I was a wreck. Needless to say I had developed a pretty nasty habit at a very young age.

At about the same time, Charlie was railing oxy 80s in one sitting. I still hadn’t tried opiates, and Charlie had actually discouraged me greatly from trying them. Well one day I couldn’t find any beer so I decided to see if Charlie would let me try some oxy. With a little convincing, Charlie gave in and showed up to my house and cut me about 10mg of his oxy to bump. I railed the line and boy did I feel good. Well I won’t go into detail but you know how that shit go.

So I started doing oxys whenever I didn’t have booze readily available. After a few weeks or so I started to choose oxys over beer. Charlie was my main connect the entire time. Every day when we got out of school, we’d hop in the car and go venture into the city to find pills from his large network of connects. I quickly started using oxy daily, and within a year was doing 60-70mg a day. Of course this was a time when oxy was readily available and significantly cheaper. Charlie’s habit had escalated pretty badly too, except he was IVing three OC 80s a day.

So to combat his habits, Charlie started dealing. He had the hookups so he was able to have oxy on deck all the time. He was a smart dealer, he maintained a good clientele and stayed out of trouble for well over two years. The cool thing about Charlie was that he always gave everyone the benefit of the doubt. He always hooked up new customer’s in hopes that they’d stay cool with him and keep hitting him up for pills. This worked for the most part as nobody wanted to piss off a new prospective pill guy. He was also the nicest dealer ever. He’d deliver to you if you couldn’t get a ride, he’d front you if you were short on cash, and he’d answer the phone at 4am if he knew you were sick. Charlie was a dream dealer.

Charlie had been dealing for over two years now and he was still my main oxy connect. I had one or two other guys but their prices were too high and supply was too inconsistent. I was very lucky to have Charlie. Well one day, a former high school classmate of ours hit up Charlie for pills. Charlie had not yet sold to this kid, but like I said always gave people the benefit of the doubt and was quick to establish a new customer. 

The first red flag that Charlie ignored was the kid wanted twenty OC 80s which is a pretty big buy for your first purchase from a new dealer. I warned Charlie to only sell this kid one or two pills to feel him out, but Charlie was too eager to pounce on a big deal. So the two meet up and the kid holds up Charlie at knifepoint. He steals the twenty 80s, and another ten pills meant for other deals. Overall he stole about $1400 from him. I remember when Charlie called me immediately after getting beat, we were so pissed off.

Now the thing about Charlie was he was one of this nicest kids you could ever deal with but he was also a dangerous guy to fuck with. He didn’t play around. I wanted no involvement, but Charlie wanted revenge. He had asked a few friends who knew the kid where he hangs out to find out where to find him. I told Charlie to just cut his losses, but there was no getting through to him during his blind rage.

So one night around midnight Charlie gets a call that the kid is hanging out near some apartment complex where he was known to chill. Charlie rolls up on the kid, leans out the car window with his handgun, and pops the kid twice in the chest. Kid goes down, everyone goes running, cops are called, Charlie rides away. 

The kid ended up surviving but of course the cops weren’t going to let this one go. The kid wasn’t cooperating with the police, but there was still a huge investigation. A week or so later Charlie tells me he’s leaving the state for a bit to lay low. He hops on a plane and flies from AK to Seattle. He crashed in hotels for a while but being an addict without any more income, Charlie quickly went broke. The investigation back home was heating up so he couldn’t come home, so he took to the streets.

About three months after the shooting, the detectives finally somehow pin Charlie as the suspect and a warrant is released for his arrest. Charlie managed to make it another month or so on the streets, until it all ended one day. The narcotics squad was conducting surveillance in a known drug-trafficking area and Charlie ends up getting picked up for buying heroin in the mix of things. He’s promptly extradited back to AK to face 1st degree attempted murder charges. 

He was facing up to 99 years but managed to walk away with 10. Charlie gets released in 2024. I still visit him whenever I get the chance. I miss Charlie so much. I miss the times when the two of us could just shove an 80 up our nose and have a good time. Before money and addiction took over everything. Charlie getting locked up left me with no more pill connects, and I promptly switched to smoking tar. After a few months of smoking tar, I moved out to OR with my mother to get clean. Eight months of sobriety (from opiates and booze) and I decided to move back out to AK for work as I was broke. Within six months of living back out here I started smoking black again, and very soon after got on the needle. 

I’m not really sure why I’m posting here but I’ve been lurking for quite some time. I finally just wanted to pop in and say hi to everyone. Today was Charlie’s birthday, and it made me think of him, and due to the nature of how things went down, made me think of you guys. I hope you guys are careful out there. I know it’s always about harm reduction, fent cut bags, clean needles, but there’s other ways that this game can take your life. I’m not justifying in any way what Charlie did, he was a violent drug dealer who tried to kill someone. But he still is my best friend, hell he’s my brother.

TL;DR - Reminiscing on the good old days with my best friend when we used to just snort oxys and have a good time. He ended up getting in some pretty serious trouble and getting hit with 10 years in prison. Today is his birthday, so I've been thinking about him extra today. This is also my first post, so I just wanted to tell my story and pop in and say hi.",1493710532.0

Thought of sharing the quick story.,"Back about 3 years ago I had developed an addiction to opiates. Nothing like it is now, just some oxy and hydro. I was taking on average about 60 mg of oxy a day and days where I couldn't get that I would take 5 or 6 Vic 10s. Nothing too crazy but because I was pretty young it was very tough to deal with mentally, so I broke the news to my folks...

I told them one night and the next afternoon I went into the ER for detoxification. I stayed in the ER for a the night, getting several tests runs. They drug tested me, checked my heart, took my blood, you know just the works. After that I talked to a doctor and he said the nurse will give you something to help with the withdrawal and he will be talking to me tomorrow. They gave me an iv of saline solution, then some iv benadryl and ativan. I slept a few hours, woke up, and sent me upstairs to a bedroom.

I woke up in a private room with my own TV, bed and bathroom. It was actually pretty nice, until I saw the cost of detox without insurance was! Anyways a middle eastern doctor came in, a different doctor from earlier, and I told him my situation. He prescribed me 10mg hydro's, norcos I believe. And was told to take 6 a day and to slowly tamper myself off. While in the hospital they gave me one every six hours I believe and when I got discharged I got a script of 30 of those norcos and they gave me some information on where to go for an outpatient program.

Now of course those 30 norcos were not used correctly. They were gone in about 3 days. Now there is 2 important things to take from this boring story. 1. Is my mom worked at the ER of the hospital, and 2. Is that my sister was good friends with the first doctor I talked to. The day after I was discharged, my mom called me from work and said they had a big meeting  about that doctor that gave me the norcos. He did not get fired, but he was for sure disciplined in some way I imagine for giving me the exact thing I was addicted to. 

 But anyways 3 days later, shortly after I finished my prescription, my mom texted me and asked if suboxone helped me with my withdrawal. I said yes of course and said that the original doctor I talked to said that's what he recommended. So anyways that doctor wrote me a prescription and gave it to my mom to fill and give to me the next day when she got out of work. I never even had an official appointment with him, he just wrote me a script and Gave it to my mom while they were working together. I was ecstatic!

My mom came home with the script, I was told to take a half a strip if I wanted but I was prescribed one film a day. I took it around 3 when my mom came home, and that night I went to the ER to because he wanted to talk to me. We had a talk right in the lounge area and he just asked how I was feeling and everything. He was such a nice guy and wanted to just help me, but I obviously knew the situation was rather strange and unprofessional. 

I was on suboxone for 6 months and all of a sudden when i texted him to go meet him in the ER to get my next script, he told me he has to take a class to keep prescribing suboxone and would text me the day he finishes it. I didn't hear from him since. I was fucked and went through terrible WD and was struggling to get by. 6 months later I checked myself into an outpatient program and since they ask a million questions they found out about that situation.

I thought beinng the guy with the hook up was where its at. I thought knowing everything about drugs was the coolest. I learned later that doing drugs was what i wanted morphine and oxy  saved me from awkard socail situations, I could fuck like a champ, talk to anyone have money whenever etc... 

That went on for a few years till just oxy and benzos were left i was invincible i could do anything. Then my mom caught me shooting up mom was my world best friend she was so upset that to fix this fuck up i got on subs everthing was good for 2 years being on sub selling my script shooting opana and 30s and coke off what i made selling my subs. Then i found out i kind of like drinking too who would of fucking thought alcohol can be awesome, the only shit part is you have to stay drunk 24/7 for it to work. So inwent on living drinking shooting and taking benzos to function i had a job and if you cand believe or not delivering chinese food witth a bottle under my seat partying with colllege kids when i got off.

It started as subs, eventually becoming kpins and occasionally gaba. He's been in one program or another of the justice system the entire time I've known him, but he finally just finished parole and has gone back to shooting dope. Since he's local and his prices are about the same as what I've been getting from my main guy (45 mins away), I've started going through him. We bicker on prices just about every time, but he lets me shoot up at my house and all in all, we have a pretty good thing going (he's never ripped me off). I added him, and then his gf (whom I only know because they used to buy bud off me and because she's a true his house half the time I go to pick up) on Facebook, and two hours later I get a message from her asking ""What's up."" I figured it was my dealer (cuz why the hell else would she hmu), so I figured I'd ignore it unless I was asked a specific question or texted directly. About two hours after that, my dealer texts me ""Wtf is going on with you an my girlfriend?"" Turns out, she told him I messaged her hitting on her, and when she said ""what are you doing,"" I replied with ""trying to make you smile."" I asked him to send me a screenshot, and he told me his gf is a pathological liar, but I'm just a customer and his gf is his gf.. You can imagine who he'd be more likely to trust. What should I do? I imagine she was trying to hit on me with the ""what's up"" message, now is tryna cover her story (which her mom coroberated). I'm fuckin pissed, because first of all I've been working on establishing a good relationship with my dealer (we used to see each other once a month, now it's like every other day), but I know this is gonna fuck shit up.

(X-post from /r/Drugs),"So today, I decided to buy some pills off the street. This isn't something I've done before, but due to excruciating pain caused by my ingrown toenail and my inability to see a doc for at least another week, I decided to pick some up. I grabbed 3 10mg pink oxycodone pills, which were marked k56. I sniffed one (which isn't something I would normally do, but this pain genuinely was unbearable, and I had to head across the city on foot due to some protests taking place near where I started). 30 minutes later, felt nothing. Swallowed one. 30 minutes later, nothing. Sniffed a 3rd pill. Didn't feel anything for about 45 minutes. Then, after I had smoked a cigarette, I began feeling extremely extremely sick and tired. Vomited multiple times. Felt very limited pain killing effects and no euphoria whatsoever. I have never vomited from opiates before in this manor, and have taken oxycodone up to 30mg orally before, as well as a number of other opiates numerous times, although they're not my preferred class of drugs. 

I know that there's no way to know for sure what I took without testing it, but I only had the 3. I'm wondering if anyone else has had an experience like this because it was pretty terrible and my stomach is in knots still, who could clue me in on what the fuck I might have taken.

I've recently got my hands on 6 10 mg oxy OPs, and a buddy and I were planning on using them soon (not all at once ofc). I know OPs are generally useless, but the Pepsi/coke method works wonders for me.

My question is to what extent does somebody's bodyweight effect their dose. I've had a fair bit of experience with opiates, but haven't had them in a long time. With no tolerance I know 20 mg will be good for me. My friend hasn't really done them before, and I want to be safe with the dosing. He weighs about 230 lbs. I weigh about 180, so I'm not sure how much of a factor weight is in determining a good, safe first-time dose.

Is this why I find it difficult to sleep when I smoke heroin #3? Yes it can make me 'nod', which essentially means closing my eyes and being in a bit of a 'dream-like' state, but that never translate to falling asleep.

In fact, I find it actively prevent me from falling asleep correctly. For example if I smoke 0.25 g of H #3 at 9pm until say midnight, it will be impossible for me to fall asleep until at least 5am, and taking a lot of benzodiazepine will be required. 

What happens is that I'll close my eyes, and just as I'm about to fall asleep, I'll get that sense of well, waking up suddenly, like when you kick your legs as you fall asleep. It's like switching between dreams, never quite falling asleep. And when I do get some sleep, it's not a nice, recuperating sleep either.

So... should I blame the caffeine? Or is it a side effect of Heroin itself? ",1493670168.0

Oxys too! You know, those blues and greens are so gosh darned expensive and you can't expect to have an easy time finding them. Even when a guy is coming through, is he really? 

... 

Paid for half a bun less five bux last Monday. Today I received my 5 + 4. Not a superb windfall when taking into the account that I threw 40 down to help my friend but either way I got slightly more than what I paid for. Tomorrow is another special day, 

...

Feels great since I had nearly a week for my tolerance to go down. Also only felt significant WD symptons for 3 days. Not as bad as my first experience with WD and I'd say it's partly because of a planned taper and partly because of a more rapid taper towards the end of that taper due to logistical difficulties. Only had gastro trouble for no more than two of those days but it wasn't as severe as my first time. First time it felt like my stomach was on fire and I wasn't even certain if it was truly able to digest food. 

...

I've learned if you can eat when sick, eat and drink water. Perhaps a few vitamins if any are available. I'm not a daily vitamin user but on days when I'm eating less than I should it seems like a good idea. Still haven't bought loperamide but I intend on buying that this pay day for good measure. 

...

So all-in-all, for me the wait was a blessing in disguise. It allowed me to take a break from a multi-week spree thereby allowing me to clear out my system and be ready for next time I need to abstain. I learned that I can go to work while feeling a little sick. I also didn't know if my symptoms would be 3 days or 5 days and of what severity. Easier to prepare when you know. Now I just need to maintain will power so I don't put myself into a hole that is too deep to handle comfortably and predictably.

I'm also glad that the dboy took care of us and made us whole by covering what was owed and allowed us to short him 20 bux while still hooking us up well. Still, just for the sake of removing the rose tinted glasses for moment, I wish were told something more honest in the middle of the week. It sounded like he had some if we could drive over.. but then the next day whether or not we had a ride he had none. Then again.... other factors came to light today but enough has been said on the topic.

For Those About to Rock
A speedball encounter scenario
by Rem



Some people find heroin boring and cocaine fake. However in meeting with those substances caution is advised, as one should not underestimate their addictive potential. The use of both substances at the same time poses even a bigger problem. With a rather small bag of heroin and cocaine one can transform his mood at will, for a few hours at least. What starts as a test drive can easily become an addiction if hits psychologically fertile ground. Before one realizes, snorting cocaine and heroin becomes a repeated thing. How otherwise, when just a nice fat line of good cocaine can elevate mood. As soon as plateau is achieved one starts on heroin and makes into a blissful, removed High. Your body feels electric as waves of cocaine rushes overlay with the numbing softness of the opiate. Problems, inhibitions, all bad feelings seem a past history as now thanks to some C&H you have been magically transformed to a more blessed plane of existence. In fact you are chemically pushing the pleasure buttons in your brain so this feels For Real. Navigation is easy. You want more lucidity and energy .. just do a line of cocaine .. More relaxed dreamy state ? No problem .. a small line of H will level you off perfectly. Your existential pain is Nullified. The Problems of Life seem small to your unlimited good-feel powers. You feel Fun. Coming Down ??? Just Do Some More.

What was an excursion into some plant byproducts becomes a small obsession. For a fistful of 10 dollar bills you Can Feel like a King of small Country. Of course its fake, But the pleasure centers of your brain are buzzed up for Real. This is the grand trap of The Speedball. Once you learn to derive pleasure from it, develop the need for that Instant, almost sexual in kind gratification, the tiny white hands of those powders grab you. However this might seem like no cause for alarm. You might say to yourself, that you're bigger than this little pile on the mirror. But as many cases around have shown, people greatly underestimate their potential for addicting to masturbatory, chemical self gratification. Then the harsh reality creeps in, as tolerance to mix builds and regular doses don't suffice to acheive the nirvana. You're a pendulum of moods as you await the weekend to do your ""thing""- rock a bit , feel good with no effort. That is the last warning to get out of the roller-coaster to hell. The ride is tremendous, But the price of admission is Very High. 

Upgrading to every 3rd, 2nd or daily use you pay first installments on the ticket. Its your good feelings. As the psychological need for the Chemical nirvana grows - so does your dose and tolerance. This quickly leads to withdrawal symptoms. As your mind spends more time nulled out, you are growing uneasy with being sober. Coping skills go out of the window. Without The Superhuman Power of the speed-ball you.re just a measly depressed, withdrawing wreck of a human. It feels like you have lost the ability to maintain a decent level of pleasure inducing brain juices without chemical help. You are No longer Indulging in the speedball, you're Living it. It becomes your vitamin, food. You do lots of cocaine to get out of bed, more heroine to go to sleep, and mix to your own pleasure during the day. Any thought of stopping is buried, as lack of those now Essential nutrients causes you to be in literal physical and emotional pain that is torturous. As the habit progresses your performance and finances take a dive. After all, now you need $60 a day to feel good, and a $100 worth to party. Soon it grows into ridiculous sums. but by then it's already too late. The trap locks. You are a prisoner now, and getting and absorbing the mix is your utmost priority, next to breathing and actually higher than eating, or for that matter anything else. The pain of withdrawal becomes so intense, you are fully capable of committing acts that you would never really consider in a sober state.

Stealing, ""Borrowing"" money, prostituting, dealing drugs are all possible realities. Whatever your desperate mind will think of to ease the pain. Oh .. well there is always the syringe. Direct IV input is a way stronger rush and much more economical way of utilizing your stash. Before you know it .. your apartment is filled with piles of unwashed clothing, garbage and dishes as you.re not able to deal with even simple chores. You have your ""pals"" sleeping in corners and shooting up. You alternate between 3 main activities 1) Buying the Stuff 2) Getting a Fix 3) Sleeping it off. But it really does not matter anymore. Even walking the streets on an empty stomach, in search of the next bag with your last food money, you will feel ""cool"" as long as the chemicals are in your bloodstream. Perhaps one day you have a godly moment of lucidity on the way to the bottom, and Decide to stop. It's tough, Its very hard, withdrawals are terrible. But its safe to say that feeling ill and a depressed for some time is much better than continuing on the path. A path that has lead many to various hells known as homelessness, street prostitution and many other well depicted scenarios. Death from overdose is clearly an option as quality and purity of such drugs is always questionable and by than you have no control over dosing.

Hopefully you are one of those that find coke fake and Heroin boring, or are able to control it. But if you ever decide to cross those white lines, remember that the potential trap is always there, just waiting to expose your weaknesses. Sounds like nasty, full of lies, drug propaganda ? Think again *Sniff* *Snort* perhaps it comes from people who had tested effects of long term opiate/coca indulgence themselves and seen the damage in people around them. It would be a lie to mask the fact that a Speedball makes you feel godly, and elevates your mood to heavenly levels, but by the same token it should be told that there is much potential for abuse leading to hell of addiction. So please be warned.

I just got out of rehab two months ago I did a four month program and towards the end of my program I was able to convince a close friend of mine to come out and get help. He arrived at the beginning of my third month and I was able to stay there for a month while he was there. I helped him get a sponsor showed him the ropes and was there for him. He had never really attempted recovery never had any clean time. I felt good I thought as though I was able to save a life.

I got a call yesterday saying that my friend had left Rehab on his own accord disappeared he left all his belongings there and took off. He was gone for just one day and it turns out they found his body lying there dead to an overdose. He seeemed so happy on the outside like his life was going well. He was able to contact his family after not speaking with them for years they were so proud that he was getting help.

This drug is so powerful. It makes those seem so happy and content in life and something just comes up and says you can get high one time that's all just one time. For my friend that one time is exactly what it would be just one time and I'd only just one time his last time.

My friend was only 19 years old he didn't get to live life he didn't get a chance to have a family or fall in love. I feel as though I failed I feel as though I didn't do enough. I've been told that it's not my fault it was his decision to do what he did. In my head I keep telling myself you could have said just one thing that might have clicked in his head to make him not use. Now I'll never get to see him again I'll never get to hear his voice again. I hate this drug I hate heroin I never thought I would lose somebody to it. Sing this happened to him only gives me more incentive to stay clean because I still want to live my life I want to be able to start a family and fall in love have children have grandchildren. This drug can take it all away in an instant and you never see it coming.

My messages if your clean please stay clean that one moment of bliss is not worth the rest of your life. I love not knowing what I'm going to do tomorrow. In the past I knew what I was going to do I was either going to get high or I was going to be sick today neither of those crossed my mind

Rest in peace Adam we've known each other since we were in elementary school together I'm going to miss you dearly I love you man.

I've actually stayed clean. It feels awesome .. my old job asked me to come back so i've been working 6 days a week. It's not difficult but I am still getting used to running around all day.  I live with my boyfriend's parents, his mom watches our daughter for us while we work.  I got home, talked with his mom and played with my daughter like normal... Then put a movie on and I sat down on the couch LOL mistake.  I got sooo tired I was falling asleep on the couch only for like a few seconds but I kept having quick dreams and wake up all fast in a panic and then do the same shit again. Once I stood back up I wasn't tired anymore.  Then today when my daughter took a nap (we share a room) I stayed downstairs on the couch. Ended up really tired again and his mom was in her room sleeping too so I was like fuck it, I'm closing my eyes. 10 mins later my daughter wakes up. So I go upstairs and bring her in the bed and we watch tv.  She starts playing in the room and starts throwing shit everywhere bc she thinks it's funny and shes right lol.  So I'm like laughing at her and his mom comes up the stairs (which she really never does) and opens the door and says ""I heard banging I thought she fell"" and I was like ""nope. Just throwing shit"". Sooo that was odd bc even if she did fall I'm more than capable of handling it. I chalked it up. My mom wanted me to come over her house bc she hadn't seen us in a few days. So I tell them were gonna go there.  I get our stuff together and in the car. It's about a ten min drive.. in like 2 mins my bf texts me ""you're going to your moms?"" Lol. So she legit called him as soon as I walked out the door telling him I left like it was a secret ? Then she told him she came upstairs and I was asleep while my daughter was running around. Umm yea it's just weird. She's definitely a sweet lady, but a bullshitter.  If she wants to make a point she will just make shit up to help her case and get others to agree with her. I wanna tell her that i literally can't get high on vivitrol, but she prolly would not believe me. I guess Its just gonna take some time to adjust to working again.  I get that she is just worried but it's so irritating bc she called my boyfriend at work and blatantly lied about me.  And she probably said it in front of his dad so now im sure he thinks I really was up there sleeping while my toddler was running wild. I may say something but I doubt it bc I don't want to start drama and hate confrontation. Plus I know she is only worried bc she cares. Still annoying tho.


Example of her tactics : she got baby clothes from a friend whos kid didn't need them anymore. One is a shirt with a tag still on, It says ""I love my daddy"". I thought that was sad. I was like aww why'd she give this one away? She goes ""ohh well the dad doesn't have a job or provide or anything like that."" And I'm like.. waiting for her to continue bc wtf ? What kind of reason is that to not let your baby wear that shirt ? Maybe he cant find a job idk. She noticed that I was not satisfied with that answer and she real quick adds ""OH and he's SO mean to them!!!"" Lmfao. I was like oh okay. Start with that one next time ;)

Tldr; boyfriend's mom is worried about me. Makes shit up so other people worry too. Whatever.",1493806239.0

we go to a gas station and he asks for ten on pump whatever and when he was getting his change back he seriously started nodding out.  i basically had to walk him back to the car like a solider carrying his wounded comrade back to base.  i sit him in the drivers seat and i tell him I'm gonna pump the gas.  I finish pumping the gas and i jump in the passenger seat and i realize that homeboy looks like hes fucking dead.  (completely blue including the lips, drooling, and his head is like a deadweight to his neck)

at this point i jump outa the car and go to his side and open the drivers side door and start slapping him in the face.  saying ""WAKE THE FUCK UP, WAKE UP""  then i start punching him in the chest.  then i notice a bystander staring at us so i give him a mean mug and say ""FUCK YOU LOOKIN AT NIGGA"" he looks away lmao.  then my junkie ass decides to light up a cig and put it out on my friends arm and he jumps up and is like WTF and I'm like you just oded get in the passenger side I'm gonna drive. hes just like okay bro and gets out and wobbles his ass to the passenger side.

second time ive seen something like this was with the same person.  we were injecting tar in a motel this time.  he does his shot and i do mine and i look at him and hes on the floor blue again but not as blue as the time on the acetyl fent.  hes also doing this thing where it looks like hes having a seizure?  so i do this thing that he taught me where you rub on a persons chest really hard to keep the blood flowing through there body.  (yes i should have called an ambulance but this person said hed rather die than have his family find out he relapsed again)  i continue this chest rubbing thing for about an hour and then finally he gasps for air and is like OW MY CHEST.  and I'm like bro you went blue on me again lol ",1493799236.0

Lsd if you can get it, you can probably get it pretty cheap by the sheet, either it be by dark net or rat race.
I've seen shit 1.50 a hit (bulk) on the DN with good reviews. 
Recently there have been these people who have been trading acid for pills. Where as street price is dictated by supply and demand and supply is always slim, shit goes for $10 a hit round this way. If you were to buy a sheet at even $400, trade 3 hits for a 20, you get a 20 for $12 and they get a free $5-$10-whatever the fuck they do with it. Larger scale example 25 footballs for 15 hits and $20. 15 hits at 3 is $45, + $20 (I was being nice) is $65. $65 divided by 25 is $2.6, he wanted $4 (you see my problem). 

I overpaid but that's because I like the guy and want all the xans and p's. 
Even if you don't like your guy though 15 hits at face value is $150. So $150, or less*, for 25 xans ain't that bad if he thinks he can get that shit sold near $10 a pop. 
The oxy is where it starts to get interesting. At $3 a hit trading  a hit for a 10 or 5 hits for 30s is the kicker. Fortunately for us we found the only black person in Ohio who sells pills and likes acid, but doesn't know how to get it.
Buy a sheet, you might be able to upgrade that shit without no one ""feeling"" robbed. 

I can only imagine if someone hooked shit up with their dope dealer trading 25 hits for somewhere in the middle of $160-$250 and only spending $50 to $70. 
I don't do dope, so someone should try it and lmk, for like science and shit.

Edit: A gram of acid (locally) is $15-20k (10 years) but you can get hits for less than a dollar, the margins are astronomical, I would advise staying small potato and never getting more than 1000, if some little risk takers do decide to try this hustle.",1493792627.0

I am in a cheap motel, dopesick, wondering how I got here. A million thoughts flow through my head and I feel compelled to write at least some of them down. I have no idea if these thoughts are of value, but the compulsion is so strong I can not resist. I ask myself, why did I get to this point? I am freezing, shaking, covered head to toe with sweat, finally able to hold back vomit. I knew this would happen. Yet, I decided to stick another needle in my arm, years after,I swore it off, knowing the ultimate result would be this no matter how much evanescent bliss I would achieve in the moment. As these waves of torture pass over me, I know with all my heart that I wish to never go through this again, yet accept the reality that as an addict I will most likely go through it time again. 

>	Sartre’s words on absolute freedom pulse through my mind and infect nearly every thought I have. That only under the duress of violent interrogation can we truly realize our freedom. That being tortured and knowing the possibility of ending it all with a single action but choosing to restrain is the apex of expression. At this point, this peculiar awareness associated with a particular poorly-designed bag-of-meat agrees. Every synapse in my brain fires irregularly, perverted by an over-expression and subsequent flood of ∆FosB protein combined with a lack of mu-opioid receptors. Only stronger than the compulsion to write is the compulsion to take out my phone, call one of my half-dozen of connections, and put the needle back into my arm. I resist. In this resistance, I find Sartre’s absolute freedom. This freedom is the complete expression of our consciousness. As much as my animal body wishes to replenish its depleted reservoirs, my conscious mind, for whatever it is capable of, is screaming no at those seemingly autonomous functions that will result in a phone call, a person showing up at my door, heat to the spoon and finally injection.

>	I am not alone (In this case, literally) I am here with my boyfriend, poor thing, also suffering the effects of opiate withdrawal simultaneously with alcohol withdrawal. My boyfriend is strong of will, perhaps dwarfing me, but struggles. Alcohol withdrawal, unlike opiate withdrawal which only makes you wish for the sweet embrace of death, can be deadly in itself. For someone who is already epileptic, the seizure threshold can drop dangerously, deadly low. I put out wine and beer for him to drink, to keep the withdrawals slightly away while not allowing him to get sloshed the way he does on liquor. Subtly shaking, while in what appears to be slumber he picks up a can of beer and sips from it in what appears to be an automatic action.

>	All this affirms my belief. Consciousness is the interruption of the autonomous actions of our bodies as meat-beings. Our animal brains dictate actions we take in the form of our hearts beating and the expansion and contraction of our lungs, as well as more complex functions. Many of our day-to-day actions are simply imprinted on our instinctual brain. Have you ever driven to a workplace and “drifted off”, to leave all of your actions to autopilot, having little recollection of taking place? Our deterministic nature drives our body a majority of the time. Only through conscious action can we disrupt these automatic actions from occurring.

>Conversely, this is the sum of what our consciousness is able to achieve. Nothing more. While one who is particularly strong of will can shut off all actions other than the ones their mind desires, it is impossible to strictly force one to actions which our deterministic body does not initially conceive of. While we may think we no longer wish for continued existence, our bodies do not have such a “program” implemented in them. We may wish to slit our wrists, put a few “practice cuts” in our arms, but find ourselves unable to go through with the exact same cuts on parts of our body which we know will lead to death. For this reason, suicide is the ultimate expression of consciousness.

Anyone got better ideas than I?,"Trying to make this quick.  I have no wheels and no cash at the moment.  I did some tech work for a client.  This client paid me $100 USD via PayPal a few hours ago.  I don't have a debit card for this PayPal account yet.  Literally cannot wait 5-7 business days for one to come in, as I am not going to be around for a few weeks after this week.  

It's too much to hope for for my dboys / dgirls to understand how PayPal works and that I am sending them REAL money that they have access to if they care to learn how to get it out.  Most dboys are as impatient about getting paid as I am about getting drugs.  Which leads me to this problem:  I have $100 that I can't easily spend.  I can try going to Dollar General and buying/returning things for cash back, but I feel like that'd be really hard to do in the amount I want to do it in.  I have a couple dboys asking me a million questions about how they could turn it into direct cash, and the one dboy who seems interested doesn't have a car.

The only options I can think of are the following:

Go to Dollar General or Autozone, buy things with PayPal (as they accept them,) and return them, HOPEFULLY for cash.  But that's not a guaranteed outcome.  Tried it once and got $10 cash from returning an item, but on another transaction I had to eat a $30 purchase.  That sucked.  

The other option I can see is to maybe get a Walmart or Best Buy eGift card online and then somehow exchange that for cash at a kiosk, at a significant loss.

Other than that, I'd have to get a PayPal debit card, which I do not have time to have it shipped.  need my money converted to taboo consumables asap.  Guessing I'm out of luck, but asking anyway, on the off-chance I'm not as creative as I thought, and y'all have known methods of doing this.

Since weed isnt addictive, scary or carries some big stigma but still considered a ""drug"" that it makes kids comfortable to try harder drugs.  

Maybe by removing its ""Illegal Drug"" status it wont be associated with dope, coke, meth, ect and it wont be a ""gateway"".


I bet more Heroin addicts experimented with alcohol first then weed, but because its not in that category it dosent expose you to the idea.  


Example.  Thinking ""well I love doing drugs, I smoke weed all the time, so a little cokes not a big deal.  Or I like this drug maybe ill like other ones too.


Lets get pot pulled from drug status so that real hard drugs are kept seperate and that thought of trying more or different drugs goes away.   


Simply classifying pot as a drug might take away the scaryness of other drugs, or desensitize them.  Pot is sold, used, kept hidden, and treated like hard drugs so whats the big deal trying other ones.



Just a rambly thought


[Edit]  ok when I say drug, Iam not denying that pots a drug, like asprins a drug,  I am saying that its treated and catagorised like hard drugs, and considered comprable to Shit like dope and coke.  That kind of drug,  STREET DRUG or HARD DRUG


In most areas buying pot follows all the same steps as buying dope.  Need a dealer, cant get busted by cops, it kind of trains you in the ways of drug deals, maybe making or considering buying heroin less scary, difficult, or different than what you already do.",1493747378.0

Sooo as many of you know I'm a pain patient with a rod in my leg. After two tramadol seizures my doctor had me on no script and said because of the crazy laws now here really he couldn't Help me until I get an updated MRI. I finally got insurance in march and did that Recent MRI showed a cyst growing in my knee, and two other things something with hardening patellar plica and then something with fluid. Plus screws in my knee & hip from my surgery. So anyway my knee swells bad lately, I've been taking pics to show doctors to add to paper proof of something wrong. Also have good ol' rheumatoid arthritis. 

My doctor threw me on oxy 5mg (not Percocet, straight oxy IR) 3x a day to lead me up to my specialist appt saying as a GP it's the best he can do. Now in NY as a GP he's not even allowed to 30 day script me, he has to write it every 10 days. So shitty. Anyway, he said that he would've given it at least one or two more pills a day plus upped it to 10mg because he knows this is a tiny amount and that it's not really working. 

The rheumatologist he referred me to is someone he knows and this guy has been in the practice for a while. I know 2 current patients of his and he has them on okayish scripts considering how hard doctors are getting slammed. I see him may 15th. 

ANYWAY my question is does anyone have advice how I can try to taper myself and not abuse my pills? I know this is like a million dollar question lol. But I do have real pain and I want to just use the meds for that and stop being a dumb fuck. I plan to go to therapy to work through my mental issues and try to work on the cause of me seeking an escape. I've been overtaking the 5mg oxys, sometimes I get a few 15mg greens here and there for free. Dope when I can. 3bags a day max on top of the oxys but this is still way higher than I should be relying on. 

I was thinking maybe I could try using Kratom with it. If I take Kratom before an opiate it kind of blocks the effect, or dulls it a lot at least. But doing it the other way around doesn't do that as much. Maybe after I used all my pills for the day, supplement with Kratom for the rest of the day?  Idk I know it's gonna be really hard and take a lot of self control but I'm tired of this shit. 

**TLDR: legit pain patient, plan to work through mental issues that might help me not want to abuse, any idea how to successfully use a script for my pain and stick to not severely overtaking it?? Possibly supplementing with Kratom? Thanks if you read this all!!** ",1493745985.0

It wasn't the first time it happened, though it does not happen often at all. Like maybe once every few months he'll make the goof in my favor. 

Well today he did it again! The order I placed clearly stated I wanted 2 halfs. The dude gets in my car, I hand him my money, and he spits out the balloons and hands them over to me. I quickly glance at it and notice immediately 1 half colored balloon and 1 gram colored balloon before I stuff them in my pocket. Sweet, I think to myself. He done goofed and I got an extra half.

But then he asked me for a ride a few blocks down the street to his place. I agree and we take off. He starts counting the money and I'm thinking shit, he's gonna notice I only paid for 1 and ask for the half back. Nope! He counts it and sticks it in his pocket without a word. Fucking sweeeet! 

Then after I dropped him off 2 minutes later I reach in my hoodies breast pocket and pull out the bags and there's actually 2 half g balloons along with the g! Fucking double score! Free grizzle! He must not have even realized he gave me the g cause usually ill get a text saying I owe them for the extra bag a couple minutes later. But no text so far and this all happened about 45 minutes ago. Fucking yes!

This is especially awesome cause my shift at work tomorrow starts an hour after they open up shop and I wasn't going to have time to see them before I went in. So I was going to have to wait until my lunch to hopefully leave for a half hour to go grab. That wasn't even a guarantee as I've only had 1 real lunch break where I left the store in the ~2 months I've been working there.

Sorry for the obvious humblebrag. I'm just super fucking stoked. I won't have to deal with shitty customers all day while sick tomorrow and by golly that just makes me happy. I hope you all have something wonderful happen to you today. And every day after. Peace fam. Its time to smoke. :)",1493743881.0

I have a chronic condition and usually avoid asking doctors for drugs to save it for a time I'd really need it. Well this time came. I had meetings on meetings and I was without any oxy.

So over the course of two weeks, I got a couple bottles of norco, and 5-10mg oxys. Obviously these amounts didn't get me ""well"" compared to my normal habit, but I was steadily slightly miserable for two weeks. I think that time did the tapering. I could never have disciplined myself to taper if I had unlimited access.

Jump to today, Day 2 completely clean and I've never felt this good this early.

Anxiety, some MINOR gastro issues, lethargy, and light sleeping are my only symptoms. 

I've only been treating myself with lope, valium, and weed these past two days. 

I can't say that a taper should work for everyone. I know it normally would have been impossible for me. And some might say weeks of suffering mildly is worse than cold turkey ripping the bandaid. 

But I just wanted to share my experience and maybe give someone an idea or hope. Usually Day 5 is when I can start making it to the store. I already went to breakfast with friends on Day 2.

What's the story that goes with?,"Well back in the day before I started using the H, I was big into poppy pod tea, I also had my scripts for oxy, norco and tramadol. As I started doing dope I was still doing these other opiates as well. I wasn't planning on doing dope that day as I had just gotten a fresh pound of poppies the day before, but my guy calls me early in the moring saying he has some fire stuff laced with fent (which we call gunpowder, is that common?). So, me being myself I went out and got some. I took some tramadol prior to leaving as I was sick and wanted to save the big guns for later. Picked up. Got home. Brewed a strong dose of poppy tea and chased 3 norco with it, and smoked a bit of the stuff to test its potency. It was good, but nothing too strong, def had fent in it. As I was waiting for the tea and norco to come on, I crushed up some oxys and did some lines (20mgs) right as the tea and hydro were coming on. A little while later I looked at my bag of dope and said fuck it, prepared a nice shot and did it. I'll never forget how I felt that day. It felt like rock bottom. I was just drunk on opiates, stumbled around, found my bed and had about a hundred lucid dreams and a bunch of sleep paralysis. But that wasn't my rock bottom, not even close, it was just a branch I hit hard on the way to rock bottom.

All in all, the alkaloids I was on that day were:

Tramadol

Opium Tea - Morphine, Codeine, Thebaine, etc.

Hydrocodone

Oxycodone

Diacetylmorphine

Fentanyl

There was a similar time with the same list above but the norco and oxy were replaced with dillies. So how many different opiates have you been on at the same time?",1493910402.0

696pug,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/696pug/gut_troubles/,9,https://redd.it/696pug,Painpatient1,Gut Troubles.,"A question to my fellow pain patients/opiate enthusiasts/both, followed by a mostly ranting shitpost. 



Has anyone had trouble with testosterone? (stupid question I suppose). Mine has bailed on me after recent surgery (and long term oxy use of over a gram per week) and now I'm not even remotely interested in sex, I don't even play the skin flute anymore and I used to feel I needed to blow a load on a daily basis. 



Another new problem recently is that I couldn't work out why the fuck my oxy wasn't working anymore! I took 40mgs and 2 hours later I'm starting to twitch and sweat like a motherfucker because it hasn't kicked in for some reason. So I think shit my tolerance must have skyrocketed and I take another 30mgs then another 20mgs a bit later and still fucking nothing and the withdrawal is getting worse. After a few hours it *finally*, slowly kicks in. 



So I go to the docs and it turns out my recent surgery has caused gastroparesis and the oxy isn't working because it's stuck in my stomach for fucking hours. Sounds like this might be permanent, which sucks but oh well that's life. 



I'm getting some gastroparesis pills tomorrow which will hopefully help but for now I'm sitting here waiting for my oxy to finally kick in again. I know people will say snort it but it wouldn't last long enough and I don't snort my meds anyway. 



If I can't sort the gastroparesis out with medication then I will have to move to the fentanyl patch. Are amy of you on the fentanyl patch for long term chronic pain relief? If so, is there any major pros and cons vs oxy? I've read a lot but would like some first hand knowledge. Thanks for reading. 



TLDR; no interest in sex and guts aren't working so oxy isn't getting absorbed properly :(

Turns out we write each other at least one email/day, the 1st time i called her : 5 hours on the phone, and same pretty much with each other phone call. And she's cute. And she has addict friends. And she's sweet, funny, understanding etc...Basically i'm falling for her big time.

So : what i've told her on the first phone call, is that i used to have huge addiction troubles but i was doing much better(which is true, because heroin doesn't rule my life anymore. I still use pretty much everyday when i'm at home, because i live 500 meters from the copping place, and all my friends are addicts or ex-addicts. But when i travel(quite often, basically almost 6 months/year) or when i'm in another town, i don't bother looking for H, and with my morphine maintenance treatment, i really don't care, and my use doesn't prevent me to do *almost* all what i would like to do.

She hasn't asked me shit about my current use. Should i tell her everything before we really start dating?(IF we start dating...i'll meet her this weekend for the 1st time, pray for me fam!!)

I don't want her to feel betrayed, but given the context and where she lives, she will never see me high, because i won't use there, and basically i only use when i'm where i live(i will move soon though).

So : she doesn't ask me about my use although i've told her i used to be deep into addiction. Now the main thing compared to before is that i am happy, and i live a nice life(and i use waaaaay less, maybe a bag/day, and it's 10% pure H when it's good). Should i tell her all like it is? Def. i won't lose her, but i might compromise a romantic ending...

And do you think i'm lying to myself? The only trouble H causes me is a rough end of month financially at times, and again, only if i'm staying at my place.

P.S: i've decided i won't set foot on the copping place anymore last night. It will be hard as fuck, but that's the only way for me not to use. Send me strength bropiates!!

2nd P.S : sorry to shitpost, but this is an important issue for me, i so much hate lying, and definitely she's the last person i want to be an ass with.

Makes sense, dope problem is way worse out east. Out west, though, tar is pretty much all we get. I'm not mad, tar is pretty great, especially when you're getting good shit for $30-40/g. It's a real bitch to work with, though. Tar is the only word for it. It's not goop, or wax, or gum. It's fuckin tar. It gets all over your fingers when you handle it carelessly, and I just hate to see dope go to waste. 

When you get the dope, it's usually in plastic. Well, tar *really* likes to stick to plastic. There are other ways to get it off the plastic, but it's usually a bitch. This method isn't as ideal for non-smokers, but if you use foil, you should def know how to do this. It's simple, really, just stick the plastic onto the foil tar side down. If you just do that, though, yeah you'll get some tar off the foil, but there will still be plenty left on the plastic. What you gotta do is rub your thumbs over the plastic for a minute, really let your body heat/friction warm it up, keep going until it feels reallly stuck on there. Then rip the plastic off like a bandaid, and there should be almost nothing left on it, all left on the foil. If the tar is spread out on the plastic you can do this a few times in the same spot with the foil, with diff parts of the plastic, to concentrate it into one place. Then just smoke right off the foil. You can even use very low heat to melt the tar and get it all together/even run it off the foil into/onto whatever you'd like. It's a good way to handle the tar in general, even for non-smokers.

Another thing, I know us junkys are cheap as all fuck, but you can get one of these little silicone containers meant for wax/dabs from a smoke shop for a couple bucks, they work *perfectly* for tar. Once it's in the silicone container, you never have to worry about any of this tar sticking to plastic bullshit. It's crazy that dealers don't just slang the shit in parchment paper/whatever in the first place but I guess they really just don't care.

Hmm, one more trick I guess, is to make your tooter out of foil. That's not exactly a new trick, but I used plastic for years and years before I realized it. There's a trick to it, though. The first time I tried I was like yeah this sucks, had to use scotch tape to keep it rolled up and shit. What you wanna do is roll the foil around a pen/similar tube, roll it tightly the first couple go arounds, then keep it tight with one finger while wrapping it around loosely with the other hand. IDK how to explain exactly, but basically the outer layers are ""baggy"" and you squeeze/twist slightly to compress the whole thing. You end up with a very sturdy aluminum tube, perfectly smooth on the inside, all scrunched up looking on the outside, that definitely won't unravel on you. Then after a few grams, unroll it and there'll be like a point right there on the foil ready to smoke. 

Another tip is to freeze/air condition your dope if you're having problems with it being too sticky. A bit of cold air will usually turn it into a much more solid state where you can break it into pieces and shit.

Any more tips??",1493859068.0
694bbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/694bbq/how_do_i_know_if_i_even_should_be_clean/,5,https://redd.it/694bbq,5y64r1t3,How do I know if I even *should* be clean?,"I've been using opioids casually for ~12 years. In the past 3-ish years that's gone from enjoying a few norcos or a percocet here and there to viewing that as my only way to relax, making sure I had pills for any time I wanted to enjoy myself. Well of course pills are expensive af and my tolerance is naturally already pretty high, so we got some U-4 (my girl at the time was/is *super* against actual heroin, it's ""gross""). The irony is not lost on me; U-4 was much grosser in every sense than any heroin I've had. Unfortunately before too long my use became daily (well, nightly), but since U-4 is so short acting I managed to never get a physical dependence, and never push my tolerance past ~10mg. I swear, in a year of almost daily U-4 bingeing, I still wouldn't go through a point in a day. Later, I did steal a few points out of the old stash that she still had hidden, and binged round the clock with a friend for a few days. Our tolerances very quickly got to the point where we needed 2 lines at a time, as opposed to a toothpick bump. Seems the key is to limit use to a few hours a night. There is no good way to use U-4 regularly though.

I stopped the U-4 after my GF had to suffer the trauma of finding/saving me from overdose several times. She used it with me, but of course doesn't have my problems. My brain was re-wired, though. I don't think I'll ever be the same after that U-4. I was fiending like never before, and my addict brain quickly found some of the other popular ""legal alternatives"". I also still used pills whenever I could, but my tolerance never got down enough to feel even ~40mg oxy. I was using an array of sort of ""lesser"" opioids, thinking I was being safe, when really I was just cementing my addiction. First I'd set the psychological addiction in with the U-4, now I was making sure I was physically hooked by doing things like using bupe every couple of days. What can I say, I'm a drug addict.

Well, my relationship with my GF got worse and worse over time. Due in no small part to the elephant in the room; I was obsessed with opioids and in denial about it. I treated her like shit because I felt like shit, *because I was clean*. I've been in this same situation before with benzos, the only fights I had with my previous gf were when I *didn't* take xanax. Now I'm on klonopin and it helps me soo much. I tried to go without benzos entirely and I just couldn't function. I have serious GAD and they help *a lot*. 

So, right now I'm trying to kick a heroin habit. My GF suggested a break, and within 30 minutes I had the dope delivered to her house while she slept. I was off and on for a couple months, until I was just on. We ended our relationship, and I still haven't really processed the heartbreak. The past couple months I've used more than ever before. Even finally got into IV'ing for a couple weeks, and got a meth habit stuck on top. Pulled the reins and got that down to a light sniffing/smoking habit, then kicked. It's been tough, and I keep slipping up. I did 7 days, but there was bupe and kratom in there. Then I picked up a half and killed it in about a day. That was a few days ago, I made it through ~36-48 hrs of WD hell again before giving in and taking 2mg sub ~2 hrs ago.

I gave in partially bc a few ppl I was talking to for support sort of asked me stuff like ""what is getting better? is getting clean right for you?"". Sounds bad out of context but the shit makes sense. I have severe multiple major depressive disorders, and I've never found any relief, except for... opioids! Of course it's not ideal to be on sub or 'done or w/e long term, but the side effects are somewhat negligible/manageable. It's not ideal to be on benzos long term either but it's an absolute no-brainer for me. I've never taken it daily for that long but I'm one of these people who is relatively satisfied by bupe. 

I guess I feel like my habit isn't serious enough yet, or hasn't been long enough or something, but really I've been using heroin casually since I was 15, been a poly drug addict since a pre-teen, and this struggle with opioids has sort of been dominating my life for the past 3 years. Not to mention I've come very close to fatally overdosing more times than I can count on one hand. So maybe I'm already in deep enough that a switch to subs wouldn't just put me deeper in the hole. I'm really trying to go completely clean now but I don't have the structure/motivation/desire to do it. I keep going through 6 day withdrawals and then saying fuck it and getting right back on. It's fucking miserable.

So, sorry for the rant, this shit is just a real fuckin conundrum. Anyone here on subs/done/maintenance go through anything similar and have some insight? I don't even want to feel ""high"" (I mean, yeah I do, but I can let that go) I just want to feel not suicidally depressed 24/7.

TL;DR Getting totally clean maybe just isn't *for* some of us? Maybe I should just suck it up and at least try getting on subs?",1493857595.0

Obviously being one who has a particular hate on for the police had the shit kids backs and warned them. They were grateful damn ain't letting a street kid deal with the police if i dont got too.

I just quit on Monday at 9PM with my last dose of level 4 China white and yes it was real and incredible stuff.

I wanted to stop for so long but couldn't after relapsing from being sober for one year in the last 6 months.. I quit my job the weekend before and picked up my last bag of China white so that when I'd finish, that'd be it. 

BTW I basically stole from my job to pay for it so that's a big no-no as well that I'll have to deal with.
I alsovl got my car impounded the Monday I wanted to quit, almost as if god was saying you're definitely going to quit this time. 

Anyways, after 25 hours I decided to take a small dose of suboxone and sent myself into Precipitated Withdrawal which sent me to the hospital and getting ativan IV'd into me. (Thank god for the philipino nurse who listened to me when I said IV my hand because I'm shot out  game at 24 years old) this got me close to my 36 hour mark where I took another 2mg of Suboxone and finally started feeling minor relief after leaving the hospital... Also with a prescription for 1mg Ativan in mg hand.

As the week goes by it gets easier but the RLS hasnt seized completely yet thank god for Sub's. 

Now I'm coming up on my 72 hour mark, took 6mg of Suboxone today, no rls, and 1mg of ativan and going well so far... I'm gonna take another 1 or 2mg of ativan later and then should be feeling pretty okay.

Guys, its possible to quit but the hardest part is knowing what happens next..  

I need support here, can anyone tell me what I could do to continue keeping clean? Any advice?

I'm all ears! 

Thanks for reading, also yes it was real level 4 heroin and my god do I miss it already but I can't live my life buying $90 half a gram of heroin every day. I need to be able to work and be normal without needing a reward, I admire those that are able to sit for hours and work, I admire those who can sit through a bus ride without a moments notice that their legs will start shaking for craving or WD.... God bless you all

The Gallows



Merry on, side by side 

Laughter leaping from our chests 

At the onward looming test 

Shadows lurking in our eyes 

To the gallows stride by stride 

Crumbs our Fathers, clenched In fist, 

Taught we scatter, without remiss 

At the traitor's taken life 

We arrived, prize in tide 

Hungry crowds had beat us there 

Repugnant in their rapture rare 

For a butcher white hangs high 

Cracking snap! Tried and tried 

Judgement dressed all hyacinth 

God wrought law In rope and plinth 

My kin avert his gaze to cry 

Wait and wait from prying eyes 

Once gone, approached deceits defeat 

Laid our breadcrumbs at limp feet 

Shrieking crows above I spied 

Understanding dawned, I'd lie 

Upon Eld's ear, returning home 

For only love from him I'd known 

His lies were theirs 

And theirs alone.",1493938749.0

You can be too","I'm writing this for those who may be seriously depressed and addicted to opiates. You know who you are, you may have issues admitting it to others, but you know when you have a problem.

1) In my case, and in the case of many many other addicts, the addiction came about as a result of some kind of mental illness, whether you know this or not. I strongly suggest asking your doctor for a referral to a psychiatrist. You need to be honest, you may need anti-depressants, your thyroid may be low (causing low energy), your hormones may be off, or, in my case, you may have bi-polar disorder or any number of other disorders. Getting the help you need here will make it much easier to stay clean. 

2) Attend meetings or 1 on 1 counseling and *actually do the things they suggest you do*. This almost always includes some sort of exercise (could be as simple as a 30 minute walk each day), creating a budget, dealing with your problems head on, etc. 

3) Realize that you WILL get better. The first month or two are the hardest. It gets easier from there. In a period of only 5 months, I went from having crippling depression to being happy and able to hang out with friends and family with energy that I haven't had for many years. 

If you don't commit yourself to a lifetime of addiction, and if you're at the point where you've had enough with this depression, lack of energy, no money, etc. then this will be the best thing you can do for yourself. ",1493924432.0

banned from r/drugs so I have to put this somewhere.

as an opiate addict I never thought there was any drug more addictive than opiates -- but it turns out the opiates are just the most addictive in terms of physical withdrawal when you want to come off it but cocaine and especially crack cocaine //freebasing is apparently the number one all consuming most addictive drug around.

Richard Pryor would spend millions on cocaine and would talk about how he would freebase all day every day any  all day every day and I'm wondering for any of you crack Smokers, **is it indeed the most euphoric feeling you've ever felt?**
**and how does it compare to just snorting cocaine** ...

and secondly I have to ask for about Richard Pryor who had millions and so would buy cocaine in the kilos and then smoke all day, surely to sleep they had to use downers? and lots of them?

am I right in thinking that every free baser would also have a **daily addiction to sleeping pills**
 which in those days (1965 - 1985) would be barbiturates because I don't understand how you can sit in your house and smoke crack all day and then just go to bed, or would they use whiskey to sleep? which I find very hard to imagine is the truth because if you are already doing cocaine drinking whiskey just make stick again even more potent emojis keep you up even longer.

I  have these questions Cos crack is becoming more interesting to me as I get into drugs and I don't really plan on becoming a crack addict but the amount of heroin addicts I know that actually prefer their  crack over the heroin which blows my mind because I didn't think there was anything more pleasurable than dope but  it seems that smoking crack is a lot more euphoric and actually had to be The most intense and hard to break addiction despite there being no physical withdrawals.

and as a lover of Richard Pryor he would always talk about how much cocaine he used to use and that he would buy in the pounds and spend millions on it and it was his drug of choice to escape but him I just don't understand how you can escape using cocaine I understand her opiates can help you skate from reality book or can I just don't get how that can help you escape me but this is my question -- maybe freebasing is different maybe smoking crack does let you escape reality even though you're going at 3000 miles an hour and sleep is the furthest they could possibly be away from you.

Tldr: freebasers - is it the most euphoria you've ever felt and am I right thinking that a daily freebasers is probably addicted to downers a well just so they could sleep. ",1494080839.0

The tl;dr is my friend used, found out that IVing makes him vomit even as sub-nodding doses, but also really enjoyed the high. I didn't relapse. 

For supplies we had new needles, bacteriostatic water (distilled water with benzyl alcohol in a 1:100 ratio), high quality heroin from a known dealer who doesn't cut with fent, .22um micron filter (probably overkill but they're cheap so I got some), some 1 use cups for cooking heroin from the local exchange, promethazine tablets taken half an hour prior for nausea and itchiness, alcohol swabs, antiseptic cream for afterwards (again probably overkill but it was cheap and also helps prevent scarring and infection), and most importantly a Naloxone injection kit.

Before anything got started I explained everything I knew to him, told him about the difference between shooting in veins and arteries, never reusing needles, rotating injection sites, how to tell if you've slipped out of a vein etc. Took about 30 minutes of Q&A and quick anecdotes before I felt like I had covered at least all the basics. I gave him one more chance to think about if he wanted to do this, made him write a short letter to himself about how he was never going to use in consecutive days, never practice bad habits, and get help the first sign of trouble (credit for this idea goes to /u/Fearzebu). I wrote on the back I loved him, and when/if he needed help I'd be there no matter what. It was sort of a quiet moment between us, I think the gravity of it started to sink in a little bit for him there.

So we began to get ready for the shot. It was a really nice day out, we were in my flat with the windows open and sun coming in sitting on the couch. I made him wash his arms thoroughly before we started. He's active and has huge veins right at the surface so it wasn't any issue finding an easy vein, honestly I haven't used in a long time but I had some serious vein envy going on, he just has veins popping out of his skin everywhere. We decided to go with the one in the crook of his elbow since it was the easiest.

His first shot was an extremely small test shot. He was shaking pretty bad with nervous anticipation so I was a little worried it would slip out of the vein, but it registered no problem, and didn't slip out. It's been a long time since I IVed, but I must have given myself thousands of shots over the years, that being said I've rarely IVed someone else, and honestly it's quite a bit harder. The angles are all different, and you can't feel whats going on, plus it just felt bizarre putting a needle in an arm that wasn't my own.

After the first one he said he wasn't feeling much, so we waited a minute, I weighed out enough that he should be able to feel something but not a ton, and he asked if he could try to do it himself this time. Unsurprisingly he got it to register, then when he started to push the plunger down also pushed the needle further into his arm. I stopped him almost immediately because I knew there was no way he was still in the vein, and said I'd do it again for him. So I did, we got a new needle, cooked a new shot, switched to a different vein, and this time all went well again. He was fairly high at this point but not especially so, so I cooked up one more shot and he was fully high.  He got about 30 minutes of good clean euphoria which he was pretty happy about. Said 

> ""this doesn't even feel like the same drug I've been snorting""

> ""I'm not crazy about the IV process it seems like a lot of effort, but the high feels so much more complete it seems like it's worth it""

> ""I know what people mean by rush now, for a minute before I feel just normally high I feel it kicking it and it's just, I don't know what to call it, but it's so satisfying.""

> ""I can't believe so little heroin got me so high, I would have had to snort like 3 times that much to get anywhere near this high"". 

All things that broke my heart a little bit to hear.

We sat on the couch in the sunlight and listened to some music and chatted before that first 30 minutes ended and he became incredibly nauseous and threw up. He ended up being sick off and on for about 3 hours after that, which honestly I'm pretty happy about. He's got a pretty weak stomach for opiates to begin with, and he'll throw up if he gets too high from snorting, but the IV made him really ill, I think it's just too much for his stomach to handle. It also wasn't because he'd taken too much, he was high, but not nodding, and nowhere close to passing out. It seems like IVing just makes him sick, which I'm hoping is enough to keep him away from it, or at least more wary of it.

I made him some ginger tea, and heated some homemade chicken soup I had made they day before cause I've been a little ill, we watched tv until the drugs wore off and he went home with all his gear, and told me he was probably just going to keep snorting, but might IV once or twice more when he has a full day where if he ends up sick it won't ruin any plans. His room mate does drugs (although not H) and knows how to use the Narcan so he said he won't be using alone. Overall he seemed happy with the experience, but despite him finding it better than snorting, the nausea, and risk of it seems like it might have outweighed the benefit. Hopefully all those needles and filters will go unused.

As for me, it was weird having a fully loaded syringe in my hands again, and H in my hands, and a friend who was high but being sober myself. I won't lie and say there wasn't any temptation, especially when I saw the needle register, I used to think that was the most beautiful thing in the world watching blood bloom in the golden brown liquid of a syringe, but I've been steeling myself against this for a week now and firmly decided not to relapse. He left with all the H, and I have no intention of getting any more or relapsing. Watching him vomit for hours, and thinking about withdrawals, and how much of a setback it would be for me to relapse was enough to keep me from using. All in all I think it went as well as it could have, he knows everything he needs to be safe, has people to make sure he never uses alone and they all have access to narcan, he learned that IVing makes him vomit all day even if he takes an anti-emetic and takes only a medium sized dose, and has me to help him stop when he decides he wants to, and I didn't fall to temptations. So I guess it was a success.",1494078511.0

My dad is a recovering Heroin addict. He visits his clinic once a month so he can get tested and so he can receive his monthly supply of methadone. After these clinic visits, he goes to hang out with some of his friends from the methadone clinic. He returns home discombobulated, unbalanced, and very drowzy.He forgets where he puts things, breaks plates, leaves food out, and falls asleep standing up. Today I had to pick him up from the hospital because he got lost and was picked up by an ambulance. He absolutely denies being on any opiods.

He also takes different medications for his blood pressure and diabetes (he takes a lot). He blames his odd behavior on these medications. I have seen him take these medications in front of me, and they do make him more sedated, but not as wacky as when he comes home from the clinic.

I am not exactly sure what to do. Should I alert his clinic? I am afraid of him being hurt or something during one of these phases. Is it possible that this behavior results from his blood pressure medication and fatigue from a day full of activity?

I'm in the Northeast, getting stamps. There are fentanyl analogue bags around, and they are sold as such and mix up totally clear. There are (or at least were) bags of dope around that mix up to the iced tea color, and shittier bags of dope that mix up lighter to a yellow color.

I don't even shoot lately, partially because I'm only even tempted to on the rare occasions I actually get good shit, so I taste the stuff when I snort. I taste a strong dope taste sometimes, sometimes not. The taste that tar and ECP and ""Mexican powder"" (? I got in Florida that was dark brown as hell and was definitely real dope with no fentanyl, just so much warmth and euphoria, the best dope I've ever gotten in $10 bags.) I got stuff yesterday that did taste like dope, and it had been appropriately hyped for me by a good friend. 

However, also yesterday, I got some bags of GARBAGE dope, supposedly h, not fentanyl. It tasted so weird. I've had it a few times now, only when I have no other options, and on multiple occasions it has given me *bad* anxiety. Yesterday I started with half of a bag, and that did have a very distinct opiate effect, but not much (i.e. none) of the warmth and happiness and itchiness I would expect from heroin. I went slow because I'd had a panic attack the previous time I used. I did 2 bags, 1/2 a bag at a time. I didn't drink coffee. I felt OK, no big panic attack, which I did have the previous time I used t

I always try to rinse my nose out ASAP after doing those bags because not only do I feel that I did something other than H, I can also taste something else in those bags. WTF is it? Who knows. I think there is heroin in the bags, but also something else that, for the life of me, I cannot imagine a way to get it out -- you could run GCMS on bags you got consistently. But how to get out another drug, with GCMS, let alone without it and no specific idea of what you are trying to get out.

I know a wheel filter won't get out drugs, just other impurities.

I just wonder, how many batches of dope have been cut with birth control pills? A friend in California (Clay) who was an old head like me said that his Mexican dealer and him would get high together, and his dealer told him that *his* dealer admitted to him that he melted electrical tape into the tar, presumably to make it ""smoke better"" and run slower o foil...This is, of course, completely insane as electrical tape is bad for your lungs...**not to mention your fucking cardiovascular system when you bang it!!!**

Does the US government allow a certain amount of raw, uncut dope into the country but require that some certain cuts are added? They could hit over half the users in a given region like that, if they allowed the biggest importer to move his shit in but added the cut.

So, why don't we figure out a way to filter out the electrical tape and birth control pills and Afghani faeces and herpetic hood ball sweat and Latino saliva, etc., from our dope?",1494070894.0

So I’ve been using very casually, chipping, for about 2 years. Shooting mostly, sometimes smoking, maybe once or twice a week for a little while, maybe three days in a row then I’ll stop for a month. 

I’ve never gone through very serious withdrawals, and I’ve stopped for long periods of time. I keep thinking I have control over it, I’ve lost my fear of it. 

Nearly a year ago I went through and told everyone, and quit and made a big stand to stop using. I’m getting to this point, though, where I’ve been lying about it (again) and hiding it. When it does come out, people around me are really upset about it and the choice is either to lie to them or to tell them the truth and then take the consequences of losing friends or lovers or loved ones. 

And the question I keep asking myself guess is like, is it worth it? Actually. Like all I’m getting is the occasional high, and what I’m losing is so much worse. And yet, I keep making the choice to use, even when I know the risk. I’ve seen friends and lovers in dark fucking places, and I know where this shit leads. But somehow, I don’t care. It’s fucked up to say, but I don’t.

The obvious answer is that I’m an addict. I’ve been to NA and AA and shit, and I feel out of place because, even though I get (and they get) that I’m an addict, it’s such a minuscule and simple problem comparatively, you know what I mean? And it ends up making me use more which is fucked. Not just that, though, it's like the whole dogma of making your life all about NOT using instead of using also fucks with me.  

But anyways, I guess what I’m asking is, what is it that keeps you from using? What finally got you to stop? How do you honestly face yourself and say enough is enough? ",1494060379.0

I got back into pills about a year ago and my tolerance has skyrocketed tremendously. Started off with bumps, was snorting full blues (30s) for a while, eventually got into snorting two blues. I started reading up about better bioavailability, longer duration, etc from eating so I switched up to eating one blue and snorting another when the oral dose kicks in. For a while it hit me like a train with a decent rush.

So this past week I upped my dose. So now I'm eating 1.5 blues and snorting one (75mg total). Was expecting to get some pretty intense rushing feelings from upping the dose, but it's pretty dull tbh. Snorting oxy doesn't do it for me anymore I guess. 

I don't want to eat my entire dose, I like getting a little rush feeling from snorting. I know that eating it all will just give me a decent high that will last longer, but no rush and no major nods. I'm basically considering two options for the other blue that I don't want to eat: IV or plug?

What's your guys' opinion on either ROA? I hear oxy has no rush from a friend but I find that hard to believe when it's affects kick in the second I take the needle out of my arm. I don't know anyone who's every plugged oxy before so it'd be nice if someone could weigh in on that too. I'd realistically rather plug than pick up an IV habit. Either way popping and snorting isn't cutting it for me. I don't want to snort the entire dose either as I hear at large doses snorting gets wasteful. ",1494056409.0

It all started with abusing the prescription meds I got from my doctor - CWE them and taking xanax before bed ( I just needed to sleep and feel relax I swear, I told myself.)
Then time went on I found myself no longer getting meds from the doctor and I bought off the street ( but I needed them for my pain.) I got burnt once - I told myself thats it I was going to stop.


Then I go onto ***** where I knew I could get anything I wanted. Sooner or later I was spending more money on pills that anything else in my life - but I was functiong! I have a stressful life and these pills eased my stress - therefore I was justified in taking them - doctors opinions don't matter it's not like they are professionals or anything - they just dont want the dea down their throat I told myself.


Then I find the holy grail an affordable sustainable source of opiates it required patience because I had to wait weeks but once I got it I was so happy.
I am only going to to this on weekends every other week - the first week I was using every day. Well I am not using during the day - then I was. I kept making excuses. At this point I was taking them to avoid getting dope sick.


I have an extensive stock of Kratom so I used that to manage my use - so I would only use the pills at night. This was working but then I binged for 2 or 3 days - I told people I had a bad stomach flu and needed to take off.


I see a psychiatrist for depression, adhd and anxiety + sleep I need these prescriptions because I really cannot function without them. I am a law student so my school work requires a focus I just wasn't born with and depression that I have had for years. The anxiety medication is the only thing that allows me to go out in public or else I get to scared and will avoid people to the best of my ability.


I am so scared I will lose my prescriptions for the problems I actually have that I don't know what to do. I refuse to go into an inpatient detox or anything like that because I want to work on this while still being a functional member of society. I also don't want anyone to know that I have this affliction (except maybe my psychiatrist.)


I freaked the fuck out this morning when I wasn't getting the same high I was getting from 300+ mg of codeine and 3+ mg of klonopin a night. I literally placed an overnight order so I could get my medications tomorrow. Phew I though, now everything will be okay. Then it hit me like a fucking steam roller - I am a full blown addict - I had been contemplating using IV morphine ( not heroin because that's a dirty drug ) and I didn't see anything wrong with that.
I am going to see my doctor next week and I want to confess everything. I know I maladaptively coping to my life events and I just started the patches for stopping cigarettes so 


I think I might as well stop opiates while I am at it.
My plans are to either A. Use kratom aggressively to combat WD's and then find a taper plan or B. Risk losing my Rx's for my psych problems and ask about starting a suboxone taper plan.
I don't know what the hell to do. I am scared shit less and just am so glad no one knows about my secret. I don't want this be on my 'permanent record' with health insurance and what not so I am reasonably hesitant for plan B and I don't know how I could use dose kratom so that I can ease off the opiates easily.


I look at the calendar and it hits me like a brick that I have been this way for 5 months and realize I have to decide which path I am going to go down and I have too much to give up by staying with this. Can a psychiatrist prescribe me suboxone or do I need to be in patient - I literally know nothing about this - I just want to break free from these chains..",1494028284.0

Wait, let me correct that--

I smoke weed in the morning before I get out of bed.

Yeah, that's better.

Now, this is to get myself hungry so by the time I am out of the shower, I would be slightly motivated to chow down something before I suffer from energy deficiency during my morning poo hours.

The day is Friday, and holy fuck, i have never been this ready for the weekend. I start the ritual like any other day. Pack the bowl with keif sprinkled on top because, hell, it's a Friday. Take a few deep breaths to exercise my lungs. Light the whole thing up, and take a huge ass bong rip.

Usually, I'd find something to use it as an ashtray. An empty seltzer can, a half empty seltzer can, a bowl with cereal milk dregs on the bottom forming green mold, empty ass disappointing prescription pill bottles, my college readmission letter, the plastic bag that is obviously right next to a ceramic ashtray... Anything is an ashtray if you try hard enough.

This time, I cash the bowl out into a styrofoam cup. It had some old ass coffee in it. I honestly don't remember the reason why I transferred the coffee into the used styrofoam cup from a disposable dunkin plastic cup. But I wanted to hear that ""chsssssszzzt"" sound when the cherry hits the liquid. I sometimes specifically practice that even though it means I would have to dump out the still-lit-precious-weed. I know, I know, it's wasteful, but I reiterate: I wanted to hear that ""chszzzzsst"" sound..!!

I take off to shower, eat my vegetables

Haha who am I kidding, I don't eat greens I smoke em.

I come back to my room to take my psych meds. I notice my bottle of Oxy 30s behind the dozens of pill bottles that are mostly to potentiate other drugs. I'm thinking, ""Do I have enough to get through the weekend?"" I pick the bottle up to shake it. It's the sound that is music to my ears. I gloat like an idiot, or in this case, a junkie who realized there are more pills that he thought.

I sit down on one of those bungee chairs, and I start carefully take out the pills onto my sweaty ass hand one after another to count. One, two, tree... This is hopeless, let me just pour it-- WHOOPS, hahaha...hah.......

Before I know it, I see a load of them slip through the crevice between my thighs, down through the bungee chair's holes, and three of them lands into the styrofoam cup that I had left it underneath the chair.

Mind you, this still has leftover Dunkin mocha swirl with floating pieces of half burnt weed in it, and an addition to that, there's a mystery used-tissue in it. It could be anything from dried snot to dried cum.

I scream FUUUUUUUUUUCK louder than your average roommate having sex with the neighbor girl directly upstairs of your room.

You can guess the ending from what any normal junkie would do in this situation.

(I poured the nastiest, slowly solidifying thing of goo on to my carpeted floor as soon as it happened and picked the pills up with my fingers and dried it in my best effort, but realized that the reeking stink won't come off, and out of agony and resentment, I put them in my mouth and washed them down my throat to numb the pain of the heartbreak.(

TL;DR I hate myself so much

My withdrawals consisted of RLS for about a week, mild sweating (more like clammy) for the first day or two, diarrhea on the 3rd day a few times, then just soft poops for a week or so, and as far as body pain went, I have genetic disorder that causes consistent aches/pain, although the intensity varies from day to day. So waking up and feeling like you were hit by a truck is nothing new to me, and basically the main gripe I have about my withdrawals is the RLS. Now I'm not trying to say I'm some badass and y'all are just being wimps. I have seen someone in WD that had damn near a 1.5 g habit a day, and FUCKING HEll  that looked terrifying. Mainly I'm just curious as to whether my reason for only having mild wd's is due my body just handling withdrawals well, or if it's because my pain tolerance for general aches and pains is just high thank to my genetic disorder.  I feel if I was in the same situation as you, I would likely only have some RLS for a few days and maybe poop more than once a day a few times.

I think mostly bc I was unhappy because I had no friends, no/shitty job, and where I lived was boring.

Then I met my current SO. I did oxys a few times with her, but we decided that if we move in together it would have to stop. About a month ago, we moved in together in a great place on the beach. We did some one night when we first moved in. And then 2 days ago, we did it again.

The first time we did it at our new house, it had only been about a week since I did it last. Still got w/d's, but not as bad as daily use. Then a few days ago, we planned a trip to go to some springs by my old house. We drove a hour and a half to get there, and when we got there we realized it was around 10 degrees colder than beachside and overcast (the spring has constant 72 degree water), so it was too cold. She then said ""Doesn't your boy live around here?"".

One call, 10 minute drive and I had the pills in my hand. We both did some and drive home and finished them off.

The next day I felt great. Beautiful day, so I did chores, yardwork, and went swimming at the beach.

Woke up this morning hoping I won't go into some delayed w/d's or something and nope. I'm good. Besides being sore from all the activities, everything is great. I'm gonna give it another 2 weeks or so before use again.

But has anyone done this, if you dose bupe on top of kratom will it still rip the kratom of your receptors and send you into pwd.


Im also thinking it might not be worth it to risk it. Maybe I'll just use the kratom today and then stop a little bit before I go to sleep and then dose the sub the next morning by which point I should probably be in full wd.

The doctor in detox was CRAZY. She dropped benzos from benzo addicts to 0 in 3-7 days. People were seizing like hell, in 4 days 14 seizures, one guy seized over 12 times during the whole time. Many people have complained about the doctor to authorities and so did we inpatients.

Coming from heavy use of oxy and fent (180mg/day in the end), the doctor gave me TWO clonidine pills and TWO hydroxyzine per day. 

She tried to give me antipsychotics but they caused RLS like crazy and I slept 8h in total during the first 5 nights. Still she didn't give me even pramipexole for RLS because ""even it can be abused"" (and even ibuprofen can be abused according to her!)

To make matters even worse she started blackmailing one of her patients to ditch his private doctor and drop benzos and ritalin to 0 in 2 weeks or she would kick that guy out of detox!

I didn't get any help at all. Only peer supports (AKA local contacts...) Never ever will I go to a drug free detox/rehab again.

On the bright side I now seriously do not want to go back to daily opiate use. Fuck maintenance therapy, I just want to get proper medication to live without daily opis.

I laughed at her and called her crazy or something like that. 

I dunno, i didn't even remember that had happened until after a few times injecting, so her having said that didn't contribute whatsoever to my opiate use. She was really right. And now I just feel guilty about it because I don't have the chance anymore to ask her for help.

About 6% of fentanyl is excreted unchanged.

So a simple way to test it is to first buy [this](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/282145593082) type of piss test. Next you take about 1-2ml of preferable sterile water and add about 15mg of the drug you're testing and mix. It doesn't matter if you have #3 heroin that's not water soluble as fentanyl is water soluble. Now just follow the instructions on the piss test except obviously don't dip it in piss, dip it in the solution you made.

There we go, a cheap way to test for fentanyl without buying several expensive reagents.

The piss tests also include 5 tests for the $5 or £3, so in actuality you're only really paying about a dollar to test.",1494139431.0

How worried should I be for a knock on the door from the fed? It was a small order since I've just gotten into the DNM, I've used all the basic security, VPN, linux, TOR broser. Only thing was that I sent my real name and address for shipping.

Do I have any sort of plausible deny ability? I also have another pending shipment coming from overseas (made both purchases the same day)

Any one have any similar experience and did you ever get visited by LE?

I've been struggling for awhile now, and I'm stubborn and private and shit, I don't want anything related to drug use in my medical record, if I can kick privately I will. I'm not averse to the idea of NA, but I'm not committed or with the right mindset enough to go. I was talking to my brothers friend and found out he's starting to get into heavier stuff. I know a bunch of people who are struggling and who know they need to quit. Then I got to thinking, what about starting a private support group?

A small group of people who all know each other, and are somewhere along the spectrum of struggling with addiction. Meetings maybe once every two weeks. Meeting opens with a discussion about how things are going, people can talk about issues and struggles, others can give advice and support. But that wouldn't be the sole purpose of the get together. For example we could meet somewhere to get coffee and talk, then go out and go bowling or something. So there would be the opportunity to talk about issues and progress, then experiencing some recreation and fun in a sober way, relearning that fun can be had without drugs.

Pros: 
people that know each other, it would be informal, it wouldn't dwell on addiction and drug use the entire time, and can start to reprogram the brain that fun is possible without drugs

Cons: Well, let me just say this. Me and 2 of my brothers use, and even if 2 of us are committed to quitting and one is still using, the others fall back in. The last thing I would want to see happen would be the group degenerating into a drug club haha. I feel like some people in the group would have to be currently sober and doing well, and everyone else would have to be strongly committed to getting clean, or at least feel they need to get clean, and willing to try to proceed in the right direction and put in work to get better...

Anyone ever think of doing this or actually tried it? Any ideas? Obviously like I said in cons, there could be the risk of people enabling each other, bringing each other down deeper instead of out of addiction. There would have to be ground rules, like respectfully don't come to the outing high. It could be laid back, like since it's narcotic focused, maybe a few beers could be had. Maybe even some weed could be smoked. The message could be clear that there is to be no networking within the group. If Johnny is taking about his heroin issues and is in WD, and Jim's been clean for awhile but facing temptation, Jim needs to not go up to Johnny after the meeting saying ""I got some money lets go get some shit"". I don't know how this could be enforced other than making it clear that out of respect for people trying to get clean, Jim needs to not take advantage of Johnny's desperation, and Johnny needs to respect Jim's progress and not help his temptation become a reality. This is the only real issue I can see with trying to do this. I mean obviously it can happen at NA too. If I go to a meeting and someone is telling their woes and I know they are an active user, I can meet up with them after and say ""hey I got some money, I'll buy you a couple bags if you help me score"". I don't know if there is a way to prevent this, other than demanding a mutual respect from everyone in the group. Like if you want to go out after and get high that's your thing, just don't involve anyone in the group and don't help bring anyone down. If you want to/need to get high, don't come to the meeting this time around. I wouldn't want to be like kicking people out or banning anyone. If there were any issues it would have to be aired out with the group, everyone making it clear that that shit ain't cool.

My Situation: 
      I'm an experienced opiate user, currently situated in brazil. Here the best opiate cost/benefit is oxycodone. 
I used to... be addicted, quite addicted, then i got treatment, but since i started up again it seems by base tolerance is WAY high. I'm keeping the interval between doses high, since i know physical dependence doesn't really come from amount, but frequency.

Question:
Since it's not about amt but dosage frequency, the only way to sustainably use opiates without creating physical dependence is to binge. What i want to know is the rates, how long can i bing for, and then how long to i have to wait for the next binge?
I beleive using for about 6 hrs every 72 hrs isn't too bad, but i think if it's kept up for too long user will start to experience constant W/D effects. 
I don't like doing 1 dose, I think the joy of opiates is redosing and finely-tuning your high, then maining it for a few hours.

All said, if i want to use for 6 hours on a night, what do yall think is the minimum time i should wait before repeating?
Also what if i were to use for 12 hours, would the waiting time increase? and if so, how long? is therea  formula to calcuate this?

I can get pretty much anything from a farmacy here, but i still think that W/D is the worst thing ever, and even small w/d with only mental symptoms is horrible since you think your actually feeling that way because of something emotional you did.


BTW this is my first post here, i often read good things here and i see many members strive to educate themselves and i find that an amazing quality. looking forward to a great relationship with yall",1494113750.0

Due to supply issues, it took a week to get it back. Ultimately I ended up getting 4 extra bags because the supplier gave him extra for the inconvenience and he gave me some of the windfalls.

This morning he texts asking what I had left and that he wouldn't be able to get more until tomorrow. Of course I'm not going to tell him exactly what I have left. Instead I ask, ""what amount are you looking to borrow?"" This time if I spot him anything, I'll be very conservative about it and will make sure I have enough for myself for at least two days. 

On the positive site, I'll be more likely to conserve and not burn through my stash rapidly which inevitably happens when you're sitting on a good amount. Like last time there was a supply issue, this is a great opportunity to taper down.

So I'll likely help my friend because I can empathize with him feeling sick and because he *may* remember this favor in the future.

Nonetheless, I'd love to hear perspectives and suggestions. I'm open to all tonalities of response. Also, what do you think is the minimum my friend would need if he snorts up to ten bags or one bundle per day?
____________________


Update: 

Should've pointed out by doing this I force myself into the ""waiting game"" because I was expecting to get my bags back today + interest. I didn't mention it while writing this post because I didn't want to be a pessimist but I half expected that something would go wrong. I should have asked my friend why he needed to wait until today to buy more dope. If I had asked he would've said ""I have a check that's dated for monday but my check casher lets me cash it a day early."" At that point I would've at least conserved what I had left for myself since there would be no guarantee that I'd be getting resupplied today. 

So tomorrow he better be able to cash that check and I really hope I get what's owed plus interest as promised. I read somewhere else that one should ""never let money walk, never loan, never borrow.."" in this game. Now what if through deductive reasoning I determined my friend would not have my dope today? Probably would've still loaned him dope but kept some for myself for today. 

I just can't believe that I didn't listen to my own instincts. I knew something would go wrong and it surely fucking did.",1494100546.0

And yes it is hypocritical to try to make her stop smoking if I still continue to use oxy with failed attempts of quitting because I rather not feel apathetic and emotionless, but that's besides the point here's the TL;DR, the answer and statement I just need to show her that smoking does so much damage to the body while pure opiates (without acetaminophen and such) do not do much damage to the body obviously if you don't OD.

*Somewhat summary (semi-TL;DR)*me and my girl are hypocrites. I use pure OXYCODONE HCL with no APAP; she smokes cigarettes. We're both addicted. But I'm trying to explain pure opioids such as oxy and morphine with no adulterants or APAP, doesn't directly harm the body in any way severely enough to cause damage (obviously respiratory depression and ODing & dying is bad for the body lol) whereas cigarettes on the other hand severely hurt your body in pretty much every way (heart damage, arteries, lungs, reproductive harm, ingesting unknown chemical into your body like arsenic, etc.)

REAL TL;DR: I'm proving and need help proving that pure opiates/opioids such as Oxycodone and Morphine do virtually no direct damage to the body where as cigarettes do so much more harm to almost every organ in your body.


Don't be a dick. Me and my girlfriend are being toxic having a proving battle on which is safer on the body CIGARETTES or OXYCODONE (opiates/opioids). 

Thanks my fellas!!!

Edit: forget to mention opiates are virtually safer on the body than per se more drugs like Adderall or cocaine because they fuck up your neurotransmitters & receptors in the brain/body. Not tryna preach we're all gonna die some day obviously but when I hear someone with a cigarette in their mouth and a drink in their hand say that ""drugs bad"" I can't help but think how ignorant people can be lacking drug knowledge.

and sorry if all my writing is scattered just took 1mg of xanax which I'm not 100% used to so I may be a little fucked at the moment but my cognition stills works.

You can call me a bartard after stating some educated facts my friends. :-* love ya's

And weed is safe too & obviously can't die from it but weed gave me depersonalization/derealization for almost a good year and scared me away from all drugs *until I got an MRI with mild sedation (they used an IV benzo called Versed brand name for midazolam three times in combination with FENTANYL 50mcg three times*.. that dissolved all of my depersonalization and derealization and showed me what it actually feels like to FEEL emotions again.. they psychedelics can change you life (which I never tried and I'm not mentally prepared to yet) but any meaningful event or any meaningful powerful drug moment can truly change your life.

I've been lurking this subreddit for a few months now, and I finally decided to introduce myself! 

I am a male in the USA in my late 20's. I was actively addicted to dope for about a year (2015-2016), and have been relatively ""Clean"" for about 5 months now. My old plug got locked up, and all of the other dboys I could find were selling mannitol with a little fent(Fuck that shit) so I switched to Kratom. Also decided it was time to chill out for a bit due to finally getting an awesome job. 

I have made 3 orders since then on the DNM for a few grams of dope. If anyone here is hesitant to get dope from the DNM due to price you should try and give it a chance.. The shit i've been getting is so pure, just a small 10mg line had me puking (was totally worth it of course). 

Here is a pic of what I just picked up.. https://anonimag.es/image/JT9s3hl . Ordered 1g, but weighed out to 1.1 so I am quite happy. This guy had some grey dope before that was completely out of this world awesome, but this stuff is tan but nevertheless still better than anything I can get from local dboys

One for each nostril.. https://anonimag.es/i/unnamed1b7760.jpg (i gave up shooting when I stopped using everyday, shit almost ruined my life). It's gonna be a good day :). About to play some CSGO while nodding.. lets see how that goes lol. If anyone plays send me a PM with your Steam ID and I'll add you! would love to play with fellow bropiates.

The baking/microwaving/snorting method? The coca-cola method? or just swallow them? I don't know how I feel about the extended release. I have only really fucked around with percocet, and about ~20-30mg really gets me high. Can I take 3-4 of these OxyNEO's in one shot??

So today my dad (who I'm living with currenlty) says that my mother, sister and ex wife all 3 day he should take me to lunch and leave me somewhere, or drop me off at the salvation army or leave me at a random park or something. (correction: My ex wife actually said that the idea of leaving me somewhere really upset her and that she hated that suggestion. She was afraid this would cause me to do something crazy or to snap.) Them all coming down to where I am living and staging an intervention (including my ex wife) was also an option discussed. The main overall point is they told my dad that I need to basically be homeless or else I would never hit bottom and get help etc. Basically straight off an episode of A&Es intervention. So here is the kicker. I had already decided to go to treatment and try to patch things up with my ex wife. But the whole making sure someone is homeless thing I think is crazy and has the potential to backfire in a HUGE way. I could see this leading someone to doing nothing but getting high all day long or killing themselves or all kinds of terrible scenarios. I've seen the show intervention and now I have an idea how fucking awful that shit must feel for the people that are being interveined on. Damn FML. In any case I have decided to go into treatment, put down the dope and step away from the needle. And attempt to put my family back together. Wish me luck guys and thanks for listening to my story.

I was thinking to myself ummm shady, but no He's my friend! So he tells me to park at apartments, borrows my phone to call. Goes ""i'm here let me in"" and Iheard a voice reply so I'm like ok..he's not bullshitting. Hand him 100$.  5 mins go by. Then 10.  I couldnt accept it, just kept smoking cigs and waiting.

Ok well they were misinformed. But I have an idea, a fucking brilliant idea. I go ""yep"".
""we cool?? I'm sick"" 
I'm fucking giddy as hell. We get some stupid nothing pills and into the cellophane they go.  Soo we drive up and he's actually in a store.  Perfect. He can't/won't kill us in there. Ex goes in and i kinda panic! But one minute later he comes out, we drive off into the sunset.

Get high, then my phone rings. Police! Telling me we have to come in. Ummmmm?!?!?! People these days have no fucking respect for the rules@!!@ Cops here are bored, they took this as a serious crime. He said we ""stole his phone"". Really? Fucking wow.
 
Were interrogated. The most retarted thing Ive ever been through.. i become annoyed. I've never been in trouble, had nothing on me, and I didn't even execute the thing. So I said fuck it, ""this dude stole money off me. And we stole it back."" The cop told me thanks for being honest. And i can tell the dude lying to cops is illegal, don't do it again.

So I have a disorder that causes me regular issues with my joints, and as such they are very easily overstressed. Well it's finals and over the course of two weeks (last week and this week) I basically have two 10 page papers to write and need to prepare for both the in-class exams, for which I will end up writing 10-15 pages per class. Now to prepare and complete all of this, I have basically spent the last two weeks working solid. This means I have spent near every waking moment sitting in a computer chair, usually slumped forward over my computer. Well I was doing fine managing my aches and pains caused by  constant sitting through the use of mary Jane.  However this changed as of yesterday, as I had basically spent 20 out of the 24 hours of Thursd and friday in my chair getting one of the papers ready to be turned in last night. This in conjunction with a warm front coming through had my joints very very unhappy with me. But I'm currently looking for a new primary source of income, and my side gig of tutoring just covers my gas. So even if I wanted to get something to help the pain, I had literally no cash to do it, and I ran out of weed around noon yesterday. My shit was so fucked up I  literally only got 3/4 of a page done over the since yesterday, because at this point even my fingers aches and I didn't even want to type. THEN JJ smiled upon me (initially it was more of a smirk) and I got a text from one of my plugs asking if I had any of my ADD meds I could spare, and we usually just trade meds for H. He also happens to be my only connect FOR ECP IN A LAND OF TAR!! AND IM SO EXCITED.......Then he basically says he wants some, but I guess he was more just checking it out as he right after we had ironed out the specifics for what quantity would be exchanging hands he followed it up with what amounted to: ""can't do it tonight, maybe Monday"". Fuck. Well the reason for Monday is we were both supposed to be busy all day today (and my brother was using my car because his wouldn't be out of the shop till this evening). BUT my brother's plans got canceled so I had my car and I decided to hit him up and tell him 30% off if you can make this thing happen today. Well I started to lose hope after 4-5 hours of no response, and because I wasn't getting anything done school wise I decided to split half the gas money I had and grab a few beers to possibly help me ignore my joints and get some work done.  And if I bought beer I would only have enough gas money to get to school for both finals. so I wouldnt be able to meet with him even if he did reply. WELL GUESS WHO I HEARD FROM ON THE WAY TO GRAB BEER!!!?!!!

Yuuuup, thank JJ that he both happened to text back right then, and his afternoon had also become free so I could run by. So even though I was broke, wasn't supposed to have access to my car all day, and my only plug I could possibly get something from  w/o cash was supposed to be busy all day; I instead am  sitting here pain free and 4 pages closer to being done with this essay. 

I know it's not a like I found a an oz of tar on the sidewalk on the 2nd day of withdrawals. But before all this happened, I had no idea how I was going to get this essay completed on time, which would likely caused me to fail if I didn't, so this is junkie Jesus


UPDATE: Oh and Ganja God threw me some love today too. My weed guy, who is awesome and has awesome (ganja) was out of town till today, but it didn't even matter because I had no money I could spend on weed. Well with the H in my system, and it being a beautiful day , I went for a walk right off campus to try and let my body remember what it's like not sitting at a desk 24/7. On this walk I just so happened to find a $10. At the time I didn't even think about being able to grab weed now, as my guy was still out of town. Well till I get a job and can afford to move in with a buddy, I am staying at my dad's which is a ~40 min drive from campus. Well the place I meet my weed dealer is an exit off the interstate that basically makes a straight shot between my dad's and school . Now the spot we meet is about 10 min away from campus and as such 30rom my dad's house. So I'm on my way home and two exits up from the one we meet off of and I get the text, ""Baaaaccckk"" and it from my boy.  One of the reasons he is my favorite, is because he always has a few strains of varying quality available at different price levels. Technically it his bottom level (still good just not amazing) that $10 a g and it's only 10 a g if you're buying 2 or more.

Back to the cycle of daily pickups, fighting to find usable veins, and hustlin' to afford the life.

So, as to the last point, I decided to fall back into my old hustle: being a middleman. Since my nORmal Connect-finding method had proven ineffective, I figured there were other people trying to find a hook, too. So once I found my own source, I started trying to reestablishing my own network on Friday night.

I forgot how adept I am at it, I found. Between Friday night and the time I came home this evening, I managed to befriend and help out like ten people; that's more than enough interactions to keep me supplied. Also, a couple of my friends are trying to do a sort of underground needle exchange, since we don't have one here, which makes rrigs hard to find. So, I partnered with them, and keep little gift bags, containing some sharps, some alcohol wipes, a cooker, and a tie, in my car to give out to people who need them. I also have a sharps container to collect their used points, and we're trying to get some narcan to distribute, as well.

So, an overall interesting weekend. I also partied with a bunch of frat boys who like to cook the hard, and I have a junkie hooker chick who wants me to be her boyfriend/pimp/general partner in crime, mostly just because we shared a motel room bathroom to both shoot up.

I'd like to share my experiences with K and Opiates.
Some seem to think there is no problem with mixing them, and the net has hardly any information on the actual effects on the high itself, mostly focusing on problems with the interactions of the two CNS depressants (usual set of problems when mixing CNS depressants, nothing extraordinary here); HOWEVER:
         The ketamine RAPES the euphoria from the opiates. I've tried this mix with dope and oxies: you get the same amount of sedation and depression but only about 0-20% of the euphoria. by this i mean the warmth, the unconditional love that feeling like your having ~60% of an orgasm except it lasts HOURS, all of that goodness is pretty much replaced by you being scratchy, not feeling pain, and SLEEPY AS FUCK (but as usual on opiates unable to actually fall asleep).
That's about it. i don't know if this effect is somehow related to the hearsay about K doing something to the opiate receptors...

TL;DR: IME K, even in very low doses (really spaced out bumps of <50mg), inhibits the pleasure and euphoria in opiates.",1494207396.0

The first time I got busted by family members they kept it in the Family. This time a family member texted a picture of a rig to my mother and sister. For whatever reason my mom blurted out everything to my ex wife and my dad told her. Oh he had money I gave him X number of dollars. I was going to go see her and my son but didn't have the money. The worst part of this is my ex wife can and may eventually use this against me to take away my right to see my son. She's being pretty cool about it for the time being, but that can change in a flash. Our relationship has been overall somewhat up and down but lately we have actually been getting along quite well. oh yeah and my family made sure to tell her that she would be enabling me if she let me come stay with her. We have actually been having sex, seeing each other and talking about getting back together. I feel that was totally crossing a line by involving her and trying to make sure I can't stay with her. WTF? Is making sure someone is homeless and on the street really helping them to recover? I understand family is concerned and all that but I really feel like they stepped over a huge line by involving my ex wife who has been up until now in the dark about My Heroin use.

Today i wanted to ask for help with dosages and intervals to help with W/D's. I used to have a big habit a few years ago and i'm very sensitive so even a short binge will bring a W/D.
Past week i've been on ~ 120-200 mg oxycodone per day, and i still have like 400mg left but i've decided to take an 14 day break.

What i have on deck: infinite xanax, infinite cyclobenzaprine, 1g of tramadol, infinite clonidine, and ~ 400mg of oxycodone.
How do i survive these 2 weeks with the least side effects possible?
I've never used any of these things to fight w/d with the exception of xanax and cyclobenzaprine (to sleep and keep me tired during the day).
From past experiences i'm expecting dysphoria, strong irritability, dis-motivation, possible heat/cold feelings... that's about it. My life is at a fragile stage and i need to keep going to class and moving forward. how should i dose the tramadol? how often? and the clonidine? also advise things that might help because in my country lots of stuff is OTC (clonidine, cyclobenzaprine, idk if loperamide helps...)

Seriously this thing is the shit! Anyways it got me thinking about what else could make living the junkie life easier.  I have got quite a few, so let me know what you guys think and add any of your own in the comments!

First, check the sidebar. It has lots of good info about life hacks to not die and to help potentiate your precious dose, so I'm going to leave all that stuff out for the most part. Perhaps the mods would consider adding a ""Junkie Life Hacks/Pro Tips"" link to the sidebar?

[Here](https://ac.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1l7tqx/what_are_some_junkie_life_hacks_that_you_have/?st=j2f8nut9&sh=24730a51) is a post I found about junkie life hacks that was posted like 3 years ago so I think it is time for an update! 

(Yes I actually tried to find existing information about a post I'm going to make before blindly posting.. That is an excellent tip many of you could take to heart before I have to read yet another post about how opiates and nicotine are a great combo and how everyone should try it. Spoiler alert: We are all well aware of your opiate and nicotine combo discovery)

So without further ado, here are my junkie life hacks:

* Check Sidebar
* Search or google your question/discovery before making a new post
* Buy a backscratcher
* Invest in a vape/e-cig: I dropped like $150 on a quality vape and I was hesitant to get one, but I am so glad I did. It is a convenient source of nicotine, it moisturizes my nasal cavity allowing maximum absorption of intranasal heroin, and it is fun af especially while tripping. Still not convinced? Then spend that $150 on dope that is going to last you a couple days before being back to square 1 with nothing to show for it. Though that is kinda why we're all here so fair enough!
* Make a snorter out of a Bic pen. You can use this exclusively and will have some residue you can scrape for when you're sick!
* Agmatine Sulfate is an excellent potentiator.. sometimes.. It is honestly hit or miss for me but when it works I'm nodding my tits off
* Don't use insanely excessive amounts of loperamide and start taking it a day and a half before you think you'll be sick (Has long half-life and doesn't help me at all until it has been in my system for like 36 hours). YMMV about the timing, but seriously your heart will thank me for using lope in moderation.
* Get a Netty Pot to clean your nasal cavity.. Night and day difference for me if I haven't used it in a while.
* Use opiates while poolside (Don't forget the sunscreen and don't drown)
* Put some dope in the tip of your cigarette. Like take out some of the tobacco, put in dope, replace tobacco and smoke! What a rush.. and what a waste, but fun to do on occasion. Or if you roll your own boges, then add it to the entire cig
* Befriend your DBoy
* DON'T BE A FUCKING SNITCH (Literal lifehack to not die)
* Don't let your money walk if you can't justify charging it to the game. No matter how well you may know your junkie ""friend"".
* If letting your money walk, ask for collateral. EDIT: Getting their ID is an excellent form of collateral. Still no guarantees with this method.
* Have backup DBoys
* Pokemon is a fantastic game for nodding
* Adventure Time is a fantastic show for nodding
* Try plugging (make sure to not have any literal shit in there for a depth of about 2 knuckles)
* If your dope gets wet, plug it.
* Sour candy while nodding is heaven. PSA: Be aware if going hard on a 5lb bag of SPK or something that you will have essentially sandpapered your tastebuds. Ever had a tongue as smooth as a baby's bottom? That is like a week of discomfort and limited food choices FYI

EDIT 1:

* Dope is perfect for come downs. My favorite is using it to come down from lsd and mdma
* Sleep with mittens!!
* Vitamin A&D Ointment helps to prevent trackmarks from scarring 
* Don't introduce friends to opiates.. It could cost them their life. Even if they don't blame you, it still was facilitated/catalyzed by you and you don't want that on your conscience. I've unfortunately gotten a couple people into dope, though they are handling it much better than I am.. Only time will tell at this point
* Use 90% Isopropyl alcohol to clean your tooter/zooter and let alcohol evaporate. You've got another dose!
* When I make my lines, I do half a line (1/4 in each nostril) then wait 5-8 minutes and do the rest
* I sniff some distilled water off my finger before or after I do my line to aid absorption
* I use aquaphor at night to repair my nasal cavity (i've had 3 cauterizations for frequent nose bleeds)
* (Random) Less is more with melatonin. .5-1mg is plenty for a dose, good for getting a restful sleep
* Peanut butter is a great way to mask the taste of vomit
* If you've gotta puke, just do it. I'd say 93/100 times I feel better and higher after puking
* A bowl of oatmeal is a good base if you're going to be doing dope all day. Helps prevent nausea and is healthy
* Don't forget to eat! I get high in place of dinner more often than I should. Fun fact: Most of the calories from food are absorbed within the first EDIT: 30 minutes of eating! If you at least get some food in you (fruits, protein, smoothies are great) the nutrients will be mostly absorbed by the time you are ready to puke
* Take a daily multivitamin. I use the gummies or centrum pill. If you take more than one dose of multivitamins in a day, you're just pissing out the rest so you can't ""stock up"" on vitamins for the week
* Stool softener is quite helpful. Stay away from laxatives
* Smoothie/Milkshake seriously these are your best friends. Filling, nutritious, and easy to digest
* Weed makes it so I can't even feel opiates if I smoke the weed after getting high on opiates. I prefer to come down from weed with dope. Helpful for nausea as we all know lol!
* Uncrustables are the bee's knees!
* Don't be afraid of your anus. If i'm majorly backed up, I apply Equate water-based personal lubricant and manually extract those boulders. This is easier on your asshole and will prevent the ripping/tearing of your rim and will prevent the hernia you're going to get from pushing so fucking hard. 
* I've heard of a little stool you can use to get leverage for pooping. No personal experience on that one but heard it works! I forget the name
* Drink lots of fluids over the course of a day (Not chug a half gallon in one sitting). 8 glasses of water a day affords you the reapage of many benefits. Good for organs, good when sick, helps constipation, essential for nearly every bodily function. Water AND gatorade. Not exclusively one or the other
* Use drug cocktails!! Got a long day at work? Do just enough to get well and do some less-hardcore amphs (Vyvanse, addy, ritalin, caffeine) to help power through the day while having some fun. Next take a day off, then have a hay day with opiates, then use benzos the next day etc.. Mixing up your drug of choice for the day keeps your tolerance to all those substances down and is less rough on your body as you are giving it time to recover from each class of drug instead of binging one drug multiple days in a row
* Is it a nice day out? Do your morning dose, make a cup of coffee and enjoy a cigarette outside for a low-key speedball. Honestly this is one of my fav things as I can take a nice dump once the morning dose wears off. Caffeine and nicotine are a great way to give yourself that kick in the pants you need to get things movin'!
* Don't use bills when snorting. Next time you're about to use that crumpled $5 bill, think about how many hands have touched that monetary compensation your'e sticking in your face orifice. Though I must say something about a crisp $100 and some ecp is certifiably badass.... Aw who are we kidding? We just spent that hundo on dope the second we it came into our possession from places.. unknown...
* Don't frequent this sub if you're trying to quit
* Don't start bulleted lists about a broad drug topic in a drug forum to further procrastinate: *Insert procrastinated responsibility here*
* Doing dope with the SO is fun and games for only so long..
* Only take the minimum amount of dope you need to survive with you. If you take it all with you, no matter where you're going or what you're doing.. those bags aren't gonna make it back home. 
* You can't use heroin to taper off of heroin. I mean you can, but you won't so don't fool yourself *He types while the rest of his last bag goes up his nose cuz ""FUCK IT""*
* If something is troubling you while you're high, you're not high enough
* Get real friends
* Use friends to find a job at a dining institution (Tips. Cash.)
* Become machine that converts cash into boogers
* Locate booger clientele 
* ??????
* Profit

EDIT 2:

* Add water to cotton and dab cotton on surface where you inevitably spilled your dope
* BANG THAT SHIT!
* Nasal spray (oxymetazoline) ironically aids to increase absorption in the nasal cavity by clearing up your nose while lowering surface area by shrinking blood vessels
* Buy Knock Off *Insert expensive and subjectively viewed as indistinguishable from legitimate product Brand while still in seemingly legitimate package here* to give to dboy instead of cash because you're broke and desperate (The best kind of broke amiright?)
* Get your drugs and get the fuck out before your ""gift"" for your ever-so-respected dboy irreparably breaks the moment it is exposed to any environment whatsoever outside of the seemingly legitimate packaging.
* Check r/opiates for ways to get a new dboy upgrade because you broke your most recent dboy edition while nodding and NOT creating a new post that is exactly the same as precisely 1,736 other posts in this sub
* Have success cold copping and get new dboy
* Pray you never see your old broken dboy or his ""accessories"" you also broke ever again!

Well folks that is what I got for today's episode of Junkie Life Hacks! I'm sure i've got more but i'm nodding too hard to finish right now. Let me know what you guys think! I'm obviously a sniffer so life hacks for shooters/smokers would be appreciated. I'll edit more in at my leisure so check back to see any new Life Hacks!

(and what can we do about it)?,"I was addicted to amphetamines. I was prescribed adderall. But eventually lied to up my dosage to insane amounts and basically had serious issues. For about 1-2 years I spent everyday tweaking my nuts off. I had a series of poor mental health issues which caused me to use and things spun out of control. In addition to that, I bought both ritalin and adderall from a different guy. So my script, plus ritalin from the street. That plus tons of weed. Sometimes xanax to get some sleep. I remember looking forward to going to sleep sometimes in the morning. it was the highlight of my day. And my life felt like a dark cartoon. I basically felt braindead without my drugs of choice. and spent my evenings coming down, staring at the wall and doing nothing but feeling ashamed of myself

Plot twist; I got really good grades as a result of my drug abuse (ironically). transferred into an amazing college and cut off a lot of people in my old friend group. I got over my mental health issues by getting help and was able to quit stims. I then built good work/study ethic and I am mostly clean and sober outside of beer, tea and shrooms. I don't do anything else. Now I am graduating with a degree and have a nice paying job

I remember the way people treated me for my issues and its horrible. When someone opens up about their drug addiction or issues, they are looking for support and a helping hand. People just labelled me, judged me. Reading this sub makes my peak addiction look like a walk in the park. I can only begin to imagine what a serious opiate addiction looks like

**tl:dr; What the fuck is wrong with people? why is it that when they see someone suffering, they judge them? People fail to realize that drug addiction is a serious mental health issue. You don't laugh at someone's depression. Why is it that people lose all ability to feel when they discuss drug addiction? Is it the drug war and stigma?**",1494176171.0

I'm really trying to change my life around to lose weight and rehabilitate my knee, but I'm in terrible pain everyday. Just getting up makes my knee feel like raw hamburger, I can barely go up steps at times. There have been a few occasions where the pain was too much and my knee buckled causing me to fall down. 

None of the doctors around me will prescribe pain pills, they acknowledge that the pain is there but due to my area having a heroin epidemic, irony, none of the doctors are willing to touch writing a script for it and refer to me pain clinics where it takes months to get in, then months of testing. 

I was able to get a hold of a script of perc 10's and oxy 30's and I'm been taking those this past few month, it's the first time in the past years I've had hope as I was able to get up and do things on my own more. I'm able to actually do more meal prep and even pick up a few old hobbies I used to love, hell for the first time in years I went on a date. But I'm at a crossroad, I make very decent money but buying prescription pills just isn't sustainable as my tolerance has gone up.

I want to make it clear that I take enough to get a mild buzz, just enough to handle the pain, never more than I need for a few hours. I understand that a lot of people may say that but I've been practicing it for past two months. Taking a lot and nodding or getting blasted into outer space has never been my style. I enjoy a mild buzz and engineering things or building projects. I understand that I'm developing a physical dependency on opiates, I do from time to time stop for a few days to see how bad withdrawals are, which medically speaking are pretty mild at the moment. 

As I said I'm at a crossroad, I've acquired a micro gram scale and several g's of H, along with 15 x 8mg suboxone. I've begun stocking up on subs as I plan to exit taking opiates in about 6 months after I've rehab'd my knee enough.  I've been waiting to pull the trigger on this as I know this is a giant step up, on one hand I can begin measuring out and insufflating measured micro doses, or I can start my exit plan and transition off. I'm not sure if I can go back to being bed ridden.. but at the same time I understand the insanity of this plan. 

I know the boy scout idea would be to flush the h and do the exit plan, then live in agony while attempting the rehab, maybe I get better, maybe I don't.  Today my perc supply runs out, so I have to make a decision.

Today he seemed excited when I told him we had found out the gender of our baby and talked for a minute.

**1. The first time I started taking pills right after I woke up:** Before this I'd wake up, do a few things, maybe hang out with friends, and then take some later in the day. One night I had the amazing idea of setting a pill next to my bed and taking it right once I woke up. ""Ill start my day off high it'll be great, right?"". Couldn't have been more wrong. From then on I had to take pills right as I woke up because until I took it I'd feel like shit. This then caused me to take pills from day until night. I think I can pinpoint this simple action as being the catalyst for my addiction

**2. My first feeling of withdrawal:** I was working my first job as a janitor at an Outdoors/Hunting store. I was standing in the janitors closet just waiting for my shift to end when I noticed a wave of heat come over my body. The feeling was new and extremely agitating. Since it was a relaxed job and my boss was shitty I just clocked out early and went back to the house and took some pills. If only I had withstood that first withdrawal I bet it would've only lasted a day tops considering I wasn't too far into my addiction.

**3. The time I went through full withdrawals, quit, but then started using again:** Quit a job thinking I'd get a new one in no time. Ran out of money. Sold everything I could get a buck for. There was nothing else I could do but quit. I withstood the physical withdrawals that lasted about a week. I can remember each night laying awake sweating and sometimes breaking down in tears. It was easily the worst pain and discomfort I've ever felt. Through broken bones, respiratory infections, the flu, etc nothing was as bad as the withdrawals. But I finally overcame the withdrawals and yet the first thing my dumbass did once I got money was go out and buy. 

**4. The Feeling when I found out my main ""drug acquirer"" had died:** I had a friend who was initially my friends dad. The guy was as experienced as drug addicts got. The dude had been legally pronounced dead 3 times yet always came back lol. He could find anything even if it was a drought and he'd get the best prices in town. I relied on him to get my drugs more than I realized. 

One day I look out my window and I seen his step-mom hobbling up to my door. I opened the door and right as I seen her face I knew he was dead. Dude died just like everyone knew he would, Fentanyl patches Xanax combo. Its what killed him the last 3 times but the 4th time was the charm I guess. Well once me and her finished talking and I went inside a wave of ""Hopelessness"" hit me. My main drug fetcher was gone. I had lost the stability that had allowed my addiction to become so strong.

**Conclusion:**My days as an opiate addict are now numbered. I had relied on this single guy for so long that my own connects are total strangers. I've tried calling them but its been so long one of em even thinks I'm like working for the cops now since I came out of the blue asking to buy. This friend could get what I needed at an affordable price. Without him its far too expensive of a habit to continue. I'd have to pay triple, even quadruple the price if I wanted to continue and that's if I could even find them. 

When my friends mom had hobbled up to my door, before she left she leaned in and whispered to me ""I can still get those"". She's been carrying on where her step-son left off. She has her own source and its been going steady for about 6 months now, but there is NO ROOM FOR ERROR. If she falls through then its finito for me. I know she's inevitably going to fall through too. She has a daughter who's set to be released from prison soon and once she finds out the price her mom is selling me these for she's going to jack the price up immediately to a level I cant afford, that is if she doesn't start taking them all herself first. Also, one thing that's stopped me from quitting in these past few months is I'm afraid if I stop calling her that I'll lose her as a connect and then in the future if I ever want em Ill have no where to go so that's one reason I continue to buy them.

Its kind of sad thinking of quitting. I really enjoy the opiate high and I don't like thinking of never experiencing it again but due to the legality issues, pricing, and availability I see no other option. The withdrawals alone stop me from being able to finish school and get a good job. You cant get a good job knowing theres going to potentially be a week that Ill have to call in sick due to withdrawals if my connect falls through. My addiction may even cost me a house that I have an opportunity to own due to an instable income that my addiction causes which wouldn't allow me to pay the bills. 

I see no other way but to quit.

End of my rant. I cant really tell this to anybody else so I just felt like unloading a little bit of it here.

Some of my questions:

I read that Bob's Red Mill is one of the better types of seeds to use, is this outdated or still pretty true?

Is it better over all to use the full process or just make the tea? I'd like to reach the optimum effects and maybe also make it easier to dose, which I think just ""poppy seed tea"" is not the best option for.

Really just any information you can give about the process and how much work/benefit ratio there really is... I feel like this should be more of a common thing? I get that because of the amount of effort it takes and budget it's not the most convenient for everyone, but still I would think more people would try this.

I know that narcan can save someone who is overdosing on opiates/opioids alone...

I know benzodiazepines have their own ""reversal agent"" called flumazenil which can save someone overdosing on benzodiazepines alone...

So here is my question: 

Will narcan alone be enough to save someone who is overdosing on an opiate/opioid *and* benzodiazepine combination assuming reasonable doses of each substance were consumed and the combination itself is what caused the overdose?

Not a fatal dose of either alone but a potentially fatal dose when the substances are *combined*...

I assume that the answer is yes because the narcan would effectively be removing the opiate/opioid intoxication part of the potentially fatal combo and leaving only the ""safe by itself"" benzodiazepine intoxication remaining.

First day you say to yourself ""I'll do more, up to 5 to celebrate"". Typically this may involve ripping two from the starting gate as snorting/insufflation is my chosen method.

..

One thing I noticed is that after doing more than two on any given day, the last one I rip an hour or so before bed time doesn't have a noticeable effect. So in other words it's definitely a waste especially if I'm spending time the following day waiting on middlemen. At that point we all wish we had saved just one bag. 

On the other hand, the first one for the day always has a noticeable effect whether or not I'm experiencing any kind of withdrawal symptoms.

I understand that tolerance increases when using opiates but I do think I hate being dope sick more than I enjoy being high on opiates. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the energy and the feeling of being on opiates a lot otherwise I wouldn't snort it throughout any give week. 

Last time I was clean, I felt really good after day four. There was a lot of positive emotion in knowing the depression of the prior days was gone and that I was out of the woods if I simply abstained going forward. I might repeat this again after tomorrow since I'm off from work for the rest of the week and don't want to be dope sick next week when I happen to be working more days than usual. 

If I don't stop after tomorrow, the only way I can sustain consumption until my next pay day and still have some left for work is if I only use two bags per day. Hence my initial question. 


TL;DR:

The initial question is valid but I shall rephrase in case anyone prefers answering the question in an alternate way:

Has anyone been successful snorting just two bags per day on a consistent basis?

I've been addicted for as long as i can remember. Dope for years. Quit 1/1, been clean 5 months. And those 5 months has been nothing but crippling depression, suicidal thoughts. I got a new gf, a new apartment, money, back in school. Doesnt matter. 

What my point is is that the battle isnt over as soon as you kick and if you kick, be prepared for fucking war. 

I'm legit on the brink of suicide (Not gonna do it) but you get the point. I think about it all the time just to end the misery. Because after I kicked dope, it's all thats left. 

The depression I had before is still here. The psychotic depressive diagnosis is still there. 

I feel happy when I spend time with my gf or my friends. When im in school studying, occupying my mind, im fine. Whenever im isolated I get immidiate intrusive thoughts of suicide. Whatever problems you had before you became addicted WILL STILL be there when you quit. Depression will 

Have a plan, see a psychatrist even if you CT like i did.

it's a drug that is much more common in the UK than anywhere else and is the number one prescribed opioid for severe to moderate pain but what keeps people mosylu delpendemt to only is the fact that it also acts as a very very strong antidepressant. 

if you're a dope user of something stronger than tramadol won't get you exactly that high but I think 250 mg 400 is a very good dose of antidepressants and for an opiate it type of high.

The truth isnthat it can an and will cause seizures over the 500 mg Mark I've used it for years and never come close to the station but I think that's a large aspect as to why people don't don't like the drug.

I've turned to buying them on the streets which has become way too expensive.

So, Im seriously considering switching to heroin, or at least trying it for a while. I know, I know, this sounds crazy to most ppl. I'm curious to hear from others who have done this. I'd like some peactical advice. How do you go about finding it and buying it, esp w/o getting ripped off? Im in so cal, and Ive seen ads online for black tar.

They forced her to come in. Over an hour went by between asking questions and HR was making calls. She signed the paper to consent to the test. But during this hour of questioning she was dehydrated from being sick and the room was hot she felt dizzy and said she needed water. They told her she could only have 40 cc of water.

And they wouldn't allow her to take the test and she lost her job and is now fighting to keep her medical license. But my question.

All of my friends opiate addictions progressed the same way. We started swiping hydro, moved to 30's, snorted heroin and then shot it.

I've seen friends go back out to use, knowing their lives will be shit, seen it all. I can promise you one thing if you're in this sub taking pills and becoming dependent, that it will progress to heroin, and you will end up IV'ing if you don't figure this out now.

I've been exactly two months sober tomorrow. Sober in the sense that I haven't touched heroin. Getting on a methadone program was the best thing I ever did for myself. It's not for everyone but I truly believe it saved my life. In before liquid handcuffs because at least on methadone you can have a life and the half life is way longer. I can finally wear dresses without being ashamed of my arms (even though I occasionally shoot sterilized water but that's another story there is something truly wrong with me,) and I go to work and make money. Sure I'm fiending but being in Morocco gave me an opportunity to fill my life and give my body a long rest in preparation for the big move. 

I'm not going back to my ghetto ass midwestern city cuz I will either die there (like one of my closest friends did a week ago, OD,) or get a criminal record. I'm moving to Spain. Yes the temptation will be real but I'll be able to learn about myself and my addiction in a place that is considerably safer and closer to home. I need to fly by my own wings I need to swim or drown. My survival instinct kicking in is the only thing that's going to enable me to fight this. ""You don't win a fight by defending yourself"" I forget what that's from.

My parents have a hard time understanding this concept but little by little I've finally been able to get through to them. They know eventually I'm going to have to live my life and they can't keep me here safe from all the heroin forever. Until someone nukes the fields there will always be heroin I'm ready to face it. Am I 100% sure I want to be sober? Fuck no. But I'm willing to give it a go.  Plus I'll learn Spanish. Being able to speak 4 languages would be neat (well 3 and a half my Arabic is the Moroccan dialect which apart from north west Africa no other Arabic countries can understand so it's pretty useless.)

It's not opiate related, and I'm not sure because I really do repress these disgusting memories and get physically sick when it comes to mind, because I can remember so much of it.

I'm sorry if this isn't allowed here. I've literally never told a single soul about it, and never plan on it. I was in therapy several times for partying and getting in trouble, before drugs, and still could never find the words to just come out with it. But, I feel such empathy in this community and really feel like it's a warm home where we can all talk about anything really.

So.. almost 20 years ago I would be babysat by a friend of my mom's, she lived very close by. This woman had 2 sons, one about 5 years older than me and the other about 10 years older. The oldest would torment me, put me in the dryer and turn it on, all kinds of shit. I hated going there then.. But my mom was convinced the younger was such a close friend of mine, because after all they had the mom friendship going on.

I was babysat for about 6 or 7 years there. Very early on, my ""friend"" would start to ""experiment"" on me and touch me. Not any doctor or house kind of shit, full plain pull your pants down and do these things to me and I'm going to do them to you. Then it progressed to him making me watch porn with him and I had to jerk him off. But, then he wanted to jerk me off. Then I'd have to suck his dick and he would try to penetrate me. It made me seriously so ashamed of myself, and now even typing these words makes me sick to my stomach.

I've never been gay, never questioned my sexuality. I have no qualms with homosexuals, it means nothing to me just like my sexual orientation of absolutely loving females has nothing to do with that community. School starting pretty much ended this whole situation, as my siblings could watch me after until my parents would get home. But the damage was done. A serious health event happened to the kid, and although he is still around the town I grew up in, I never talked to him or saw him much. I couldn't even think about him without getting sick. For so long, I wondered if it all of it was my fault and that even tho I love women, if anyone even knew would they all ridicule me and I be labeled gay forever? My whole, real, friend group was popular so it would have been devastating. I think I always was so focused in school and loved it so much because it was my escape.

Can't believe I'm posting this. Almost 20 years later it still makes my stomach physically ill and makes me cringe so hard. Still question myself on the situation, was it my fault? Since he was only 5 years older.. does that mean I had control? I was so young. I love you all.",1494371588.0

I was heading back to my side of town after leaving my dude with a gram on me. All my life my parents have stuck in my brother and I's head cops will sit at the spot of the high I got busted at. He followed me across four lanes of traffic just to turn his lights on.

It was a quick stop. Maybe 5 minutes? If even that. 

He asked for my license, registration, and insurance. I told him I can give him my license that the car is my brother's and I do not know where the other two are. I then like a dumbass proceeded to make a show of digging into my glovebox where freshly cut of straws and a mirror was. I know he had to at least seen one of the two because he was on my passenger side glancing into the glovebox as well. 

He pulled me over because he seen me swerve into a lane. I almost hit the Prius in front of me because they randomly started going slow as sin. I fed him so bullshit story about how they had just gotten on the highway and recounted like five cars around me (like make and model as well as color) and how I had to quickly avoid them. 

Didn't get a warning, no ticket, no nothing. He told me he just seen me swerve and if it had happened the way I said it did then he pulled over the wrong car. 

TLDR: State Trooper pulled me over, no registration, no insurance, and had to have seen my straws and mirror. Had a fresh gram on me. No ticket, no warning and was told to have a nice day. 

I wasn't even shaking or sweating it. Yet when I got pulled over a month ago meeting dude and all I had was the money on me I was shaking and the cop noted it. I'm starting to become a seasoned vet with the cops. Thank you Junkie Jesus? ",1494371404.0

been living all around south america for about 6 yrs now and im well aware of corruption and crooked cops here, have had to pay bribes here n there but not a whole lot and it was never so blatant, like they just show up at my door asking me for money or threatening to take me to the calabozo - dungeon - jail holding cell. 


one thing i know is generally if they want money dont argue or bargin with them, and its better to pay what they are asking unless its a lot and you just dont have it, just to avoid trouble. now i have heard horror stories of gringos getting taken for lots by the cops but nothing that bad has ever happened to me, maybe it was just dumb luck....


i guess i have to look at it as an occasional arbitrary gringo tax. try not to let it get me down too much but today was just over the top. that said i dont want any trouble and will just roll with it and probably try to find a better room to rent in a better part of town. 


i just got some decent cash, live on a very very low budget and keep a super low profile, blend in with the locals and dont call attention to myself, dont have a car or flashy expensive things but i do live in ""el barrio"" more or less. i had just stored most of my cash in my super duper uber secret banco del colchon but i still had a fair amount on my person as i was going to buy some new clothes and other stuff. so they asked to search my place and who am i to say no but i didnt have anything to worry about anyway, i literally have no valuables, one bag of clothes and basic toiletries. the room is really basic they took one look around and asked me to empty my pockets. i took out my wad of cash and they got all wide eyed. fucking corrupto policia de mierda! asked me how much was there and I told them. then they wanted to know why i had so much cash. i fished out a western union recipt for like 350 so they wouldnt get any ideas and showed them that. they then pocket my 200 and say ok have a good day with a smile on their face and probably off to eat a fat cat lunch on my dime no doubt.


anyway i am really lucky i had that recipt and also really lucky i didnt have the rest of my cash out n about or they could have gotten me for a lot more. now i am thinking like ok gringo tighten up your opsec! and its already as airtight as can be, i usually never go around with more than like 20 and the rest is stashed very safely. i did not have any drugs thank god or that would have given them the pretext to take me away and ask for a lot more to let me out. 


was feeling pretty shitty and a bit shaken up before but have calmed down a bit and just needed to vent. anyway im sure this group is very open to corrupt cops robbing you so i wonder what kinds of stories anyone has to share, and my words of wisdom are to not make yourself a target and do whatever you can to limit your exposure.",1494370322.0

I seen a post on FB going on a rant about the 'if addicts get free Narcan why can't cancer patients get free chemo?' that has been going around. Welp, I shared it. And a friend of mine shared it as well, but her sharing of it included a giant rant about how all addicts should just die and quit wasting everyone's time. She is a 'recovering' meth addict of 12 almost 13 years and now still abuses her son's script of Adderall. She is fighting with me in comments and I just gave up. 

Even if I didn't use, I wouldn't judge addicts that are actually trying to function. Everyone wants to lump us all into the junkie grouping.

And when the fuck did crack become socially acceptable? 

A vice is a vice, I'm so tired of the raging hypocrites on Facebook and life in general who rage about opiate users. 

I don't even know why I try to get people to look at it from a different view point, we're all bad people to them and a danger to their community. But they aren't with their drunk driving bullshit.

Then i came upon some kpins which i never fuck with anymore and usually am first to say FUCk your benzos but now ive been blacking out bahhhhh. Sunday was bad, greyed out as fuck trying to hit a vein and my arms look bad. 


Yesterday at work i was careless. I usually have long sleeves to cover my tattoos but now having to cover track marks is not a habit im in too. Well bitches get to talking like bitches do and next thing i know im sitting down with my boss and HR. i acted super offended off the bat, told em on friday i let the new phlebotomists practice drawing blood on me. HR seemed pretty satisfied but my boss knows im full of shit. But i have a really good relationship with him, he gave me an hour before i had to do a urine drug screen. Ive been carrying around this bottle of quickfix for 2 years in my backpack and used it. Im so worried it wont work. Ill find out soon. 

I havnt been sober for more than a few days in maybe 5 or 6 years. Im really truthfully scared. I wish i could find subs but i dont have the time or energy to this week so i got kratom in my bag and thats it. I havnt used today and feel okay but the yawns are rolling in. I should have called in sick..but what looks worse..me calling in, or me being dope sick at work. FUCK.

So.. Im gonna drop this sub for awhile and that bums me the fuck out. I love reading yalls stories, even the stupid fucking memes make me smille. I just know for sure i dont want to be another statistic. I really dont want to die but i really dont want to be sober either. Moderation was never my thing and ill probably go after the bottle now, but thats legal right :/

Not an opiate user myself, but my mom's been one since I was about 2 years old, and I'm 18 now so she's been going for a good long while now. Thankfully my dad got me away from her and they divorced as soon as he realized she was an addict. AFAIK she's done about every opiate under the sun, ODed one time but got narcaned back to life. Right now she's on suboxone and I've been trying to get her to try kratom (I use kratom myself so I'm decently knowledgeable about it) because she's tried suboxone and methadone a few times each and they've never worked long term for her. She's interested and willing to try it once she's done with some court stuff in about a month from now. I was just wondering if any of you folks had some advice for a situation like mine.  I just feel like this is her last chance to get clean because there's tons of fent and even carfentanil in the area so if she goes back to stronger opiates there's a good chance she's done for. Especially since she doesn't seem to bother testing anything she takes. She doesn't live with me and my dad but I've been regularly texting her info about kratom. I'm really worried about her and I'm just hoping that some people with experience can help point me in the right direction as to how to treat her or things I can do.

I've poked around here for a few months just because it's nice to get an idea of what might've gone through my mother's head through all these years.

so i took my last 30 this monday around 9 pm. yesterday i took probably 2-3 mg of a sub at 11 am, then maybe another 1-2 mgs last night befor bed. i also took about 20 mgs of lope. I did the same this morning. (I also dab concentrates constantly through out the day unless at work). And surprisingly i feel.....

normal??? I guess? very slightly detached/weird... But normal. 

I swear i feel about the same as i did when i was still on blues. I guess i was just at a point i wasn't doing enough to get high and couldn't let myself spend anyyy more than i already was. i guess this is usually where people decide to start using H, or shooting up or both. For many reasons I don't see myself going that direction. The few times i have tried it was just underwhelming AF & just felt weird. 

Im a littl nervous since i have only a little more than a whole sub left, but i also am kiinda glad since i really dont want to depend on them like the last time i got sober.. I plan to stop once im out, and taper off. now i just need to find some fucking xanax which is damn near a fuckin witch hunt out here. 


I plan to only take subs, lope, xanax, kratom (NOT AT THE SAME TIME) throughout th next week. If i was to only do them each 2-3 days simultaneously would that save me from having more withdrawals on top of opiates?

--

I want to email the suboxone / methadone clinic in my town (I hate talking on the phone as it is, not to mention it being about recovery which is even worse), but they're asking for my address and insurance info before I can even ask a question. I'm not sure if this indicates a scam (as I've heard almost recovery clinics have no interest in their patients' well-being).

- I'm very concerned about keeping my identity secret, as I'm in education and hoping to teach in this town, as well as run for town council in the near future. Is there any way I can find out the cost of treatment (through insurance) while being sure my identity is protected?

- Also, would you guys recommend methadone or suboxone? Do I get a choice? I think I'd be willing to go to the clinic every morning if it meant I was getting a full agonist, but maybe siomeone with 'some experience can tell me otherwise?

- Lastly, are there any specific requirements that I need to know? Do I need heroin in my system or can it be any opiate (I alternate between heroin and PST)?

--

I've been using for about 4 years to varying degrees, so you can probably imagine that it took me a lot of consideration to decide on this.

Weed, I never know where itll take me.  Will everything I do become more interesting? Creative enough to let me break through mental barriers i didn't even know were there?   Or will I spend hours replaying every bad decision ive made in the last 15 years? 


Acid, every time it wears off i feel like im a kid realizing that magic isn't real.


Cocaine,  after the initial rush and the afterglow a peice of me fades away. when everyone goes home I feel alone, dirty and empty. If i have to pick through my carpet for hours to find the chunk I dropped, my dignity is a small price to pay to fill that emptiness.


Meth, yeah sure come over! We can do what we did last time.  Talk about nothing and everything with bits of biography and fiction mixed with sex so that by the time the sun rises we won't have followed anything to its conclusion except our lust.  Damn the sun's coming up, let's try that again.  We can do this for weeks!  Sleep is unnecessary, sanity is temporary.


Benzos, it's nice to not be crippled by anxiety. Its also nice to have inhibitions in place to keep you from punching random people, deciding to have another drink, going on a 4am food run, sending 4 am messages to your ex (possibly while driving to get food). its also nice to know where you are when you wake up, and how you got there.


Alchohol, See benzos but include waking up feeling like you've been hit by a train and rodents made a nest in your mouth then died while having an orgy.  Plus I tend to remember all the bad decisions I made while drunk.. benzos at least spare me that.


Opioids, wrapped in a protective warm cloud.  Everything is falling apart around me, mimicking the way my insides shattered long ago.  Its ok though, as long as you don't leave me. hold me untill i fall asleep?  please don't leave me. I've been saving, is this enough for you to be there when I wake up?   I'm sick and tired of waking up without you. 
Im always sick or tired though.  Don't worry about that thing, I'll do it tomorrow when i feel better, you'll see.

Anyway about 2 weeks ago I got a job in a restaurant downtown in my city. I didn't really talk to others there to much just cause I'm shy at first and then once you know me I'll tell you anything you wanna know. Well my coworkers were getting to know me and when I told them that what I did for fun was ""go party and hangout with friends"" they wanted to know what my idea of a party was so the topic of drugs got brought up. 

Well after talking about all the ""hardcore"" (I guess) drugs I've smoked, snorted, and swallowed of the last few years one of the servers told me that him and his sister had scripts for painkillers and benzo's that they never ever take and they just throw them in jars in their cabinet. 

And boom! Suddenly I have what feels like unlimited access to oxy, hydros, xanax, kpins, morphine, codeine, and some others he didn't remember the name of. Good prices on all of them too.

The reason I ask is due the fact BTH commonly contains 6-MAC.
I've done #4 and #3, but never BTH. But I know that doesn't mean much considering #3 &#4 arent suppose to have any traces of this, and bth is suppose to.

I got all excited about 6-MAM and completely forgot about 6-MAC being a possibility.
I'm gonna try it anyway, just would like to hear from others.

Before anyone thinks that 

Stop.
 It's not that. 

There are a few things I feel and realize 


-my boyfriend can NOT be emotionally, mentally or physical controlled by me and I have no say so in how he feels 

-these pills are in fact creating a false hope and covering up his emotional pain 

-there is a chance he may never want to completely stop and take it therapeutically (which he does)

-and there's always a chance of him taking one pill too many after a build up of tolerance.

He takes too much sometimes if that makes sense 
Nothing drastic to a point of overdosing 

But he's been through hell in the past two years alone he's lost both parents. He lost really anyone who cared about him 
He has depression and lacks motivation and I do too at times. 
The MENTAL withdrawal I feel is what's killing him. 

Every time he gets a call or text I see his eyes light up. 
I see the way he looks at his phone the way a man looks at a woman they love 

It's scary. 
To know and love him as much as I do and have people tell you to walk away
It's scary 
Not wanting to leave their side because you're scared of them going overboard
It's even scarier when he sleeps because even though mentally I know he couldn't have possibly taken enough to OD he took enough to not wake up as soon as I shake him lightly and say ""baby I love you"" or feel my lips kiss his
Or hear the sounds of me crying because I'm so scared that tomorrow isn't promised for us or that one day there won't be a day for us to say I love you because he's gone so far

I'll clarify he's very med savvy and can recite practically Any pill you give him without referencing
And he's never overdosed he just gets overboard and dippy sometimes (a little more frequently than normal) 

I'm not much of a user but I have snorted Percocet with him on occasion and taken them sometimes too I'm admitting I'm no angel. And I can see why he loves them so much I fight it too every time I look at them I want that shit crushed up in my nose and down my throat.

Bottom line

I love this man with all of my heart 
I love him so much I cried in the car ride to the dealers house 
And on the way back home but I did it quietly so he wouldn't worry. 

I know the withdrawal has aches and pains and physical hurt but I just need support. 
I don't need to be told to walk away
Because you can't walk away from the ones you love when you need them most. 

I want an opinion on how to HELP stimulate him mentally 

An opinion on how to keep his mind off of it. 

A story of someone who had to learn the hard way 

A reassurance that things will get better 

I want someone to fucking feel this post and think of their loved one who they lost because of this fucking opiate shit whether it be the pain of the person dying walking away or just completely shutting them out I know all of you have felt that once and it doesn't feel very good

I don't need anyone telling me to ""walk away"" because That's completely selfish and taking an easy way out and could possibly lead him to taking more. And I was raised not to quit on anyone or anything. That's fucked up. 

But to all of you that I'm reaching out to. Anyone struggling to kick this shit and anyone just struggling mentally just know that there is a brighter side to life and not everyday will be a day you can smile
Not everyday can be full of laughs
But when you get there hopefully you'll look back at the very second of reading this and remember your emotions
Remember your struggle and pain 
and realize that it's nothing you can't handle. 

But please for right now I just need some support. 
Because I can't lose the one I love and 
I don't want him to ever lose me or push me away because of these. 
Thank you all in advanced 
Xx

My most memorable would be, working as a middleman, middle of December, blizzard in nys.

Custy/coworker carmine (with a full mike Tyson face tat) asks me to get dope at 11 pm. Ride to Walmart to meet the guy, got him $200 worth ($100 for free for my self for price diff on bundles)

Drinking a beer in the back with carmine, get pulled over after leaving Walmart because the driver didn't know where the lines on the road were by a stateboy because blizzard.

Carmine hid his beer and tried to hide mine. Cop saw mine. I had 30+ bags in my pocket and rigs. I was out past curfew, on probation. Cop asked everyone for id's and name told him I didn't have my license on me, he asked me last and forgot to ask/write down my name. Made us follow him to the local sheriff station/county jail.

Turns out nobody had a valid license.
Let carmine keep my beer and told him to ""drink it on the way cause he was getting a ticket for open container anyways.""
Turns out nobody in the car had a valid license. Never got my name ran and never had to swallow 30+ bags of dope.

State boy told us he couldn't let us drive away but ""if we waited five minutes and drove away after, the driver would risk another driving without a license ticket"" then let drove away. In the jails parking lot.

I shot up to get right in the 5 mins. In the parking lot. Stopped at a gas station and the trooper was on the other pump. Saw me going to pay for gas and just shook his head.

He really hooked us up.

Turns out carmine told a guy at a party he could get dope, guy thought he meant coke, took the money and drugs, prolly never paid him back.


Also I was dropping off a bun once and got caught doing 94 in a 55 and got a ""failure to obey a traffic device' ticket because according to the trooper "" no judge would reduce that ticket because I was 1 mph under being arrested and losing my license. "" and the cop ""was young once""

So, 1st thing when i arrive, a friend asks me if i can middleman for him, and i got a free bag in less than 10 minutes. Off to a good start. Then i meet a guy i've hosted at my place quite many times, and he tells me he had just found 15 grams of h. So he offers me a big fat line, so so far almost 0.5 gram free. Next i ask him if he would like to have the vita, he offered me 1.5 grams for it. I wasn't pleased, so i asked for 2 grams at least. He was ok with it, my vita is gone, but i have at least for 2 days worth of stuff.

Afterwards, just because i sent someone to another friend who deals, the said friend offers me a beer, and a pack of cigs.

Cherry on top : after snorting a nice line, plus offering one same-sized to my roommate, i scale the stuff : there was 2.8grams left!!

Why?,"Hi guys-- I'm someone who does volunteer outreach with homeless folks, a great many of them opiate users. In my town, people tend to use H or dilaudid most of the time. When the first wave of fentanyl really hit us four years ago, I asked some of our usual gang what they thought of it. The response was unanimous: everyone said they hated fentanyl, that there was no rush, it did little more than make you pass out, and when--and if--you woke up again, you were basically sober. I've literally never met someone who sought out fentanyl. The people I know who've done it had it in bags they thought were H (or I guess in counterfeit pills).

My question is this: I know SOMEONE must do fentanyl because they like it. How common is that? Does everyone have the same experience as the folks I asked about it? Is it more euphoric for some people?

I'm trying to get a handle on ""the fentanyl crisis,"" because I'm not sure how much of it is people deliberately going out and buying what they know to be fentanyl, and how much of it is people getting surprised with fentanyl in a bag or pill they thought was something else.

Please let me know. It doesn't really make a difference to the way I deliver services to the folks I work with, but it helps me to understand the news, at least, and talk to civilians about harm reduction issues.

It was a copping experience that just turned into hell on wheels. 

So in my state there's this area that takes up a large chunk of a county, it's basically the sticks and is notorious for all of its hard drug activity and mishaps. Lots of woods and trails with poor neighborhoods scattered throughout. There was a crew I would hang out with and we would always go to that area to cop. The guys I always ran with were B and C, the other guys in that crew weren't able to make it on this very unfortanute day. 

We were going to cop from a dude we picked up off of frequently, J. Today this kid who I've never met but knew my friends was riding with us, his name was T. Usually I'm driving, but today B was. 

The meet up spot was by this park with a row of houses just on the other side of the road. B parallel parks in front of the houses, and I see the Dboy J in the park just 20 feet to our left. I was in the passenger seat, and B turns to me and says, ""My boy T is taking care of it this time,"" and T gets out and starts walking toward J. Okay, whatever. I just met this guy like 40 minutes ago and he seems pretty solid so far. B, C and myself are just bullshitting for a minute or two before I look out the window and see J pull A FUCKING PISTOL out of his waist and stick it in J's face. 

""GIVE ME THE FUCKIN DOPE, GIVE ME THE FUCKIN DOPE,"" He's shouting at the top of his lungs, this is the middle of the day and he's doing this shit outside of the car in a park. I start asking what the fuck is he doing and B decides then to inform me, ""Oh yeah, we're robbing him by the way."" Well thanks for the god damn heads up. Such bafoons. 

Now J is a big motherfucker, and even though T is sticking a gun in his face and took the dope, J isn't blinking or moving at all. Until T does. T starts backing up toward the car and J is stalking toward him at the same pace, he has no fear, or if he did he wasn't showing it. ""I'LL BLOW YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF IF YOU DON'T STOP MOVING,"" T would be screaming, shaking the pistol in J's face, walking back toward the car, and this giant named J kept walking toward him. It was honestly some brave stuff and I applaud that part of the performance. Ballsy shit. However, it drew the attention of a kind old lady who stepped out of her house right by the car. ""What's going on here?"" 

I turn to her and say, ""it's almost over, don't worry about it."" 

""I'm calling the cops."" And she retreats inside. Fuck.  

At this point T thought he had something to prove, so he decides to walk circles around the car with J slowly chasing him, hoping at one point J will back down or he'll gather the balls to pill the trigger. I step out of the car while they continue circling each other. ""T, get in the fucking car, seriously, quit dickikg around the cops are coming."" Then I make eye contact with J, ""J, I'm sorry bro, I had no idea these fuckers were doing this."" 

I get T in the car, I hop in, and B speeds off, leaving J in the rear view mirror staring the car down with a look of cold blooded murder on his face. A couple miles down the road we heard the sirens approaching, but we made it back to the crib. I was bitching at everyone the whole ride home about how that's the kind of thing they need to tell me so I can not be there for it. 

Oh and it was only for a gram. 

Oh and T dropped the dope getting into the car, so the only thing that came from this was a severed relationship with a very solid connect.",1494533611.0

[A retrospective... and a question],"So I have been clean from heroin for 11 days and I feel pretty much normal again. A little insomnia still, and some stomach cramps, but otherwise fine. In the peak of my habit I was insufflating ~1 gram per day and then suddenly quit (due to running out of money lol) for about 4 days. Then I managed to get a little bit of money and bought a couple bags and decided to IV for the first time to make it worthwhile. I was 'extremely' careful and was IVing much less than 100 mg and still felt amazing. So I think my tolerance must have gone down. Well I had a fun little week of my IVing and then decided that this was a crossroads for me. I realized this after I used just a little too much (probably interacting with the long half-life kpins I took) and went to get a drink of water from the bathroom after a shot, only to wake up 2 hours later soaking wet from my spilled bottle on the floor. That was my last day of IVing, I snorted the rest I had (about 0.2 g) and that got me merely well for one day and then quit. 


As from the beginning that was 11 days ago. Now I'm not looking to jump back onto the dragon's back, but I can't deny opiates were a wonderful study aid. I have been working on completing my thesis for the past week and just have had no motivation or willpower to do anything on it. I have leftover Tylenol-3's from long ago (the start of all this in fact) and was wondering would any amount of codeine even touch me at this point?



tldr; Used to insufflate 1g of H, tolerance went down a bit, insufflated only 0.2 g and felt normal, quit for 11 days. Would using codeine produce anything anymore? Or have I climbed too high up the opiate ladder?",1494529867.0

She glares at me, obviously not amused, her friends in the back seat aren't amused either, I feel their eyes burning holes into the back of my head as one dipshit mutters an insult under his breath.

I just used half of the money I have left in this world to get everyone in this car well not 20 min ago, what the fuck is wrong with me? I loath myself more than they ever could. No matter what crazy stories she's been telling people this time.

I fantasize about being in my bed at home a county away, interspersed with thoughts of showing this kid in the back seat why he's subconsciously scared to do more than mutter under his breath.  I know I'm not really mad at him. 

He has the look of someone who's been strung out for a while but hasn't been through the real bad shit yet.  This isn't his first rodeo, but he still has that bravado and excitement in his speech, his eyes have a happy manic glint to them, not the dull deadend hopelessness I've grown so used to. His lady has that look, I've met her before, she's been turning tricks to support his habit.  He has no idea.  

Why did I even agree to come on this clusterfuck of a pick up?  I needed the human contact and i could use the money, but I knew damn well that this girl and I have a bad history, our demons don't play nicely with others.  

After one look at the couple in the back seat I should have gotten out of the car, fuck it I coulda walked the 20 miles home.  At least I wouldn't have been violating my probation.  I'm a master of self sabotage.   I was supposed to be turning my life around when I got caught up, that elusive last time..  One missed methadone dose was all it took.  Then 4 months in jail the last of which I spent kicking, I get out and I do this?

""Fuck me"" I think once again, this time keeping my self deprecating chuckle on the inside.

It was about a guy who coerced his mom into driving him to someone to buy suboxone and to pay for it, and then heard her crying in the bathroom. It was very sad. It also reminded me of my story which is very similar but also much happier. Just for reference, my mom is generally very anti-drug. It happened 2.5 years ago when I went to a rehab clinic to quit a heroin addiction. I was there for two weeks and they kept me on suboxone, but after I left I didn't have a prescription and my appointment with the doctor was in 2 weeks. So as I was feeling very bad and was afraid I was going to use again, I called my old dealer, told him I quit heroin and asked him not to sell to me again, and asked him if he had any suboxone. He did. I didn't have any money, so in desperation I stole $20 from my mother's purse (damn these stupid old habits!). As I was about to go, she found out and confronted me, and I explained what I was doing and why I needed the suboxone. She said ""Why didn't you just ask me? I would have given you the money, anything to keep you off heroin"". Then she actually drove me there so I wouldn't have to ride my bike in the rain. I got the subs, it kept me well until I went to the doctor, and since then I've never used opiates for 2.5 years and counting. I love you mom, thanks for bearing with me. ",1494667046.0

Last year after getting off a nasty Valium/Ativan addiction I decided to start using opioids often. I was suffering from severe chronic anxiety and dereal/personalization while also being in a long term relationship with a girl that I frankly couldn't tolerate any longer alongside of having to hide the fact I had to sling $400 every two days to keep myself alive. I've enjoyed opioids for awhile but always kept myself in check with their use. I said fuck that and chose to get smashed every day for 3 months until I built up a physical dependence that would cause a believable death for my fam/friends due to an OD. I wanted to die slowly and enjoy myself  before ending things intentionally. I was up to 160mg/day of Oxy, not the craziest habit but in a rural town thats VERY expensive.

Fast forward 6 months later and Im here loving being alive and happier than ever. Ive randomly and rarely used script opioids and Fent once(hated it) since I kicked cold turkey last November as well as other drugs but as of 3 weeks ago tried skag for the first time. I like it enough to use it but not enough that it makes me crave it like I do blues. Ive snorted and IV'd it, 3 times the former, once the latter, but idk it is just really mellow (IMO) compared to the sharp euphoria i used to get from Oxy (again imo). 

My question is how long do you guys think itll be until I cave and relapse? I have an awkward life right now as im inbetween jobs and apartments due to some strange personal issues that ive been indirectly affected by that are too complex to go into atm. I can afford the outrageous $20/pt premium we have here but so far ive not given into any desires just out of the blue. Only when I already had plans to buy it anyway.

Sorry if any of this is confusing Im edged out rn on coke. Thx for reading c:

My regular dose is around 10-15 milligrams orally and that makes me feel quite amazing, but I would still want to experience the famous nod. The problem is, every time I upper my dosage to the levels which I assume would make me nod (30mg+), I get lots of nausea which ruins the whole high. I guess you could say this is a blessing in disguise but it still bothers me a bit. 

Is oxycodone even a good opioid for nodding because from my experience it isn't as sedating as lets say morphine? I'd probably try heroin but (un)fortunately there's practically no heroin trade in where I live.

It come down to simply not having enough money to pick up weed along with my dope. This has caused me to forget that I can actually nod out still haha ::) I'm pretty damn happy that I've rediscovered this combination...I'm not using half as much dope before I'm nodding out. It even takes away some of the nausea that I'll experience around %25 of the time.
Some say that it causes quite a bit of respiratory depression, (which I won't disagree with) and others have said it makes the paranoid and have heart murmur/irregular beat.

I haven't experienced this, however I do believe that it increases your heart rate and drops your blood pressure therefore allowing the opiates to spread across the blood steam very rapidly, and could even become fatal in large amounts of both. This is almost the exact quote, and I have no idea if this is true or what but the effects tells me that there might be a little bit of truth to that, (low blood pressure potentiating the effects of both drugs, I don't believe you could die from this combo unless a stupid amount of heroin is used.)

I've looked through some websites and many different forums but have come to realize that this is a subject that's rarely brought up. What do you guys think about it. Have you used this combo & do you enjoy it? Will it make you nod with decreased amount if heroin, and most importantly do you think weed is actually potentiating heroins effects by spreading the drugs through the bloodstream at an increased rate?",1494653197.0

Basically, as a noob to the opiate experience by and large, I am wondering how to know when you are nodding too hard.

I do not have a tolerance at the moment and 20 mg of hydrocodone is enough for me to have a good time. I believe that I have nodded several times as I remember being in a state of basically conscious dreaming interspersed with periods of being fully awake and back in my real surroundings. I believe this is what is referred to as nodding as these sensations were accompanied by euphoria and a sense of wellbeing.  


Any insights on how to know when you've gone too far would be appreciated! I have recently acquired some promethazine so I would like to try potentiating my standard hydrocodone dose to sample the effects and would like to be as safe as possible. Cheers!

	Fuck. You ever have those rare introspective moments in life? Where you look at your life and wonder just how the hell you’ve dug a hole this deep? I have. I have that every morning when I wake up. The missed opportunities and burnt bridges and ruined friendships and bad examples you’ve set? Losing jobs because “you just didn’t feel like it today”. For people like me, Losing jobs because you were dopesick, or nodding too hard to function. Probation, Court, Paternity tests, Suspended licenses, Custody battles, Relapse, Alcoholism, Dopesickness again, Taking things you shouldn’t take to fix the sick. Rotten teeth, debt from medical bills because you cant be bothered to have insurance and your credit is fucked anyways. Headaches from aforementioned rotten teeth. The list goes on and on and nearly everything im going to whine about is self inflicted. Not knowing why I made the choices I did. Hopefully if I finish this story, and anyone bothers to read it, It might make you feel less like shit about your life. I’m going to try to tell it in the order it happened, but your reading something written by a scatter-brained, alcoholic, ADHD, like bi-polar, ex-junkie who is nursing a neat vodka at 11 a.m. So, let’s jump into it then?













Early Life

	I had it made, I did. In 4th grade I had an add test (Definitely had it) and the psych-fucks-whatevers did an IQ test. Oohing and Aaahing over how smart of a kid I was. My sister had been tested and tested in the high 150’s-160’s. Definitely genius (Show-off) while they told my parents that I was in the high 140’s or “borderline genius” with a near photographic memory. Im not too sure if my two younger brothers ever got tested, but I’ve probably killed off the brain cells that remembered that anyhow. Back in those days, I learned being “The smart kid” was terrible. Nobody liked a showoff. We were in a tiny rural town in upstate NY that trapped most of the kids growing up there or in surrounding small towns. I still have a bunch of friends there doing the same shit as me, in a different town. The only sports my school really offered was Football (Too much running for me), Baseball (Kind of dumb), and Swimming (Eww a giant fucking toilet). I ended up finding other ways to injure myself. Skateboarding (Second longest lasting hobby after my dope addiction), wrestling with my younger brothers and friends, Riding dirtbike and atv/atc (The threewheeler is better.), back yard football (less running, more concussions, my kind of sport), and getting in fights. Back then I had a much worse temper and definitely about exactly the same impulse control. I feel bad for my brothers, they got the brunt of my anger. We’d fight over anything, and some were brutal. I’ve heard people say fights with brothers don’t count, they definitely fucking do. I was always scared of hurting someone in a scrap at school, but family was fair game for some twisted reason. Our family was kind of rough and tumble, redneckish, etc. I’ll try and give you a list of some early memories.
	The snowmobile incident. This was before we moved from Oswego to Wayne County. Circa: Around 4 years old. The first sign I might be a complete fucking moron, albeit a lucky complete fucking moron. My dad had a (pretty nice as I remember it) snowmobile, and had cousins and neighbor kids and my brother Steve (2 or 3) out in the front yard. He had tied a bunch of sleds in a line and was slowly pulling all the kids in a line around the yard and they loved it. I was sitting behind him on the snowmobile and my cousin Adam (a few months older than me) was sitting behind me. As I remember it, although this is over 2 decades ago, my brother Steve was sitting on the last sled and fell off at 2 mph. The snowmobile was a bit coldblooded and hard to start sometimes if you shut it off. My dad asked me if he could “leave it running without me touching anything”? Of course I said “yes!” and as soon as he was a little bit away I slid up and held onto the handlebars to be like pops. I saw him walking back, and much to the protests of Adam, I kind of panicked and hit the throttle. Thank god he jumped off and so did any of the kids in the sled or I would’ve killed someone. At 4 years old, I did a full lap of the large front yard we had (I remember going up on one ski in a wide circle at one point with the throttle pinned) before crashing into a plow truck we had parked by the driveway. I closed my eyes as it happened and really cannot even begin to explain how nice physics were to me. I hit the truck, fast, maybe the snow around it, I have no idea. Somehow I ended up underneath the truck, opened my eyes and couldn’t see where I had flew in, complete silence, and after a minute or so of appreciating being alive still, my father dug/dragged/pulled me out. I had totaled his snowmobile. I told both of my parents that my stomach hurt really bad… Until the neighbor’s daughter I had a crush on came over and wanted to play, then I was fine. Twas the first example of ruining my parent’s stuff, making them worry, and doing stupid shit for cute girls. 
(Foreshadowing)

The caravan incident (#1)…... We had moved from my childhood home (Trailer) to an actual house. We were parked at a gas station in my mom’s van. I remember feeling my brother Steve tap me on the shoulder, turning around, and getting punched in the nose as hard as he could. Just because. It sticks out because it’s the worst bloody nose I’ve ever had. Both nostrils, Full flow. Over ten minutes of bleeding. I probably deserved it though.
Anyways, as aforementioned, I’m scatter brained. I might dive back into earlier memories but my brain isn’t feeling that right now. “I’m good bruh”-The bane of my girlfriends existence. How about diving into into where my love affair of opiates started?

Nate1
	
Nate was a friend. I guess. I knew him for a while. It was most certainly a Love/Hate relationship. The fact he now tries to text me for dope hookups  is a bitter sweet irony. My first taste of opiates was from my mother. Gimme a sec and lemme explain. Nate and I had been friends for a while. Since elementary school. We we’re great friends but if we spent too much time together we’d get in fights. Kind of the same situation with a lot of my childhood friends. Any-fucking-whoo. This incident happened around 13-14 years old and ended up shaping the rest of my life. Nate and I were rough housing and wrestling (I think me or him had a fight at school coming up and were practicing for it. He ended up trying to do a take down, but instead of a double leg, he grabbed me around the waist. I tried to counter by putting my legs down. Mistake. My right ankle rolled. POP!
“My ankle broke.”
He laughed it off, in 5 minutes it was 3x the size it should be.
Called my mom, went to the ER, where the doctor took one look at it and said “You’re ankles broke.” After doing X-rays he came back in and said “Well, it’s not broken, but it would’ve hurt less if you had broken it. It’s just a severe sprain.” He then prescribed an air cast and crutches.
…and told me to take ibuprofen. Thanks brah.
	Maybe because she felt sorry for me, realized I was in pain, My mom gave me one of her “Headache Pills”, casually mentioning she would take two sometimes because she liked how they would make her feel. They were big pink-fucks and I noticed she had at least two full bottles. Propoxyphene (now banned for causing heart attacks) was my first opiate and I loved it. One Pill. Three pills. Five pills. Fifteen pills. Twenty-five pills. This was over a few years. She had bottles of 240 pills and didn’t notice when one went missing. I think I told her about this being my first opiate experience, but I’m not sure. I don’t want her to feel guilty. I found out why Darvs are banned now. My first heart-scare was around 15-16. After 2 or 3 years of daily Darvocet abuse, I came home and took 10 pinks. Something was wrong after an hour or so. You know the feeling when you pull a muscle? My heart felt like that. I cut down my daily use, but everytime my heart beat it felt like that. For two.fucking.weeks. ALSO, My mother confronted me because she had gotten a new script, had taken none of the 240 pills, and there were only 90 left. My parents were pissed, I blamed friends for taking them while worrying about dying every night when I went to sleep (had apology/explanation letter in my bedside table and fell asleep how I’d want my parents to find their dead 16 year old) The funny thing is this was just the first time I planned my death because of this drug, and I didn’t care.
	After getting busted about the blah-blah-blah amount of missing pills, I found new sources and started buying Vicodin/Percocet/fentanyl patches from fellow highschool students or adults willing to sell drugs to a teen.

THE FUCKING FIRST BOOZE INCIDENT!
This also happened with Natedawgdiggity dawg! We made friends with a neighbor across the street from me named Timothy. I remember thinking I was racist because he was black and from Haiti (Maybe?). We had just read “The Cay” in school, and (Never to his face) I called him Timootay of da cay… Gotta read that fucking book again. Anyways. I might’ve been 15-16. We each had 20 bucks. Gave him our $40. To go to the liquor store and get us 2 of the big bottles of vodka… The 1.75 liter bottles. He took a while to get them and we thought we had got ripped off by “Timothy of da cay”. He came back with 2 bottles for us and told us he bought 2 of the 99 cent bottles of fireball for himself as a finders/buyers/whatever fee and actually gave us change back with a receipt. 
Anyways…. It might’ve been the night before something? I’m not sure. It was a holiday eve-fuck. My mom had friends/neighbors over. I was in my room. Drank half the bottle of vodka (Nate sniffed his bottle and said it smelled like 7-up, so the drunker I got, the more it tasted like 7-up). I ended up waking up the next morning. At 11. On. A. fucking. School. Day. Dad. Stayed home from work, that’s weird. Tear my room apart looking for the other half of my bottle I spent 20 bucks on. Thought to myself I must have hid it really good-like yannae (Fucking trainspotting fuck-talk, it means “You know”…. By the way “You like degs?”…. Fucking fuck pikeys something). Go downstairs and asked my mom why no one woke me up for school? (I’ve ways been horrible to wake up… used to have full arguments with people I never remembered having whilst waking up. I’ve called my mom every name in the book, once accusing her of “being a fucking gypsy” or something along those lines.)
	Her response, “Oh, you’re father thought you would be too hungover to go to school.” I saw the empty bottle of vodka sitting on the kitchen counter. Apparently I “went to bed” blackout drunk at 7 p.m.
 The rest of the story I can’t promise is accurate because of drunk. According to my brothers and parents, after going to “bed” I went downstairs. Walked around in circles in the living room drunkenly, with friends/neighbors there. My brother mentioned he was planning to wear the jeans I was wearing after my nightly shower to school tomorrow. No problem bruh, I took em off, handed them to him and walked around in my boxers for awhile. My dad ended up walking me up to my room, seeing the bottle, dumping it, then (I imagine, staying up all night worrying about whether or not to bring me to the hospital). Worst.Fucking.Hangover.Ever. I saw my dad had called into work, told my mom I was fine to go to school, and had her bring me. I got a “Very Pissed” glance from my dad and a talking to (My dad has a fucking scary loud yelling voice, I’ve inherited it, around this time we had some pretty intense screaming matches. I was too big to spank and he knew I probably would’ve fought back. That reminds me of the next story) went to school, tried to eat lunch and couldn’t…. blah blah blah dumbass drunken story.
Early Life2

The “Last time my dad hit/spanked me story”
No idea why I was in trouble…. I might’ve been 10-12. So before the vodka and ankle stories. He was pissed about something… Probably trying to make us clean up messes around the fucking house. He was yelling in his scary loud dad yell. I tried to walk away. He grabbed my arm hard. I tried to pull away and he thought I was cocking my other arm back to hit him (With my temper I very well could’ve been). I got back-handed hard and got yelled at for trying to punch him. My jaw popped and I couldn’t chew right for a week or so. That fucking sucked.
The murder.
This happened around 5/6 years old (Remember when I said I would try to tell these in chronological order? Plot twist, junkies fucking lie., who saw that coming?) There was an apartment building next door. My mom befriended one of the tenants, a black lady named Robin. She was an on/off crackhead living with a dealer. He was old but always friendly. One day he asked my dad to borrow a hammer to fix stuff around the house, blah blah blah. My dad gave him the hammer. He waited for her to come back from her night job, outside, near the driveway, under mine and my brother’s window. Knocked her out with the hammer. Dragged her inside. Butchered her in the bathtub with a butcher knife. Look it up if you’d like. My mother confronted him the next day while we were waiting we were playing with her kids waiting for the schoolbus… 
“Wheres Robin?”
“She took the wats bus to Rochester to go score crack.”
(Pretty sure her words were) “That’s bullshit, she would’ve left the kids with me if she did that” (She hated this guy and robin wouldn’t have left them with him.) while trying to peer around him into the apartment.
He closed the door behind him and said “Lady, if you don’t leave now something bad is going to happen to you.”
Turns out, he killed her, with the kids there. One of them woke up and saw him cutting her up. “If you say anything I’m going to do to you what I’m doing to your mama”. Fucked all the kids up. For life. My mother tried calling the cops. Had a Sherriff tell her “She was reading too many mystery novels and bad things like that don’t happen in small towns like this.” A week or so later, I woke up to police cars all over the yard/driveway/road and they were finally investigating after enough calls from family. The grandmother and aunt called daily. He had moved out and had the landlord help him carry a rug with the cut up body parts in it to his car. Buried them underneath the trailer he moved into. I remember it was around my birthday, and him moving. He was irritated I was trying to show him the bike I had just gotten while he was loading stuff into his car. My mom immediately called me back over when she saw me next to that evil piece of shit.
They found the body. The old apartment smelled like bleach and when they did the black ray bloody-mcfuck spray stuff they said the entire living room and bathtub lit up like a christmas tree.
My dad got the hammer back from the cops after the investigation and still uses it to this day… “What? It’s a good hammer”
FUCKING PENIS BITING.
Before she died, Robin had a son. A year or so older than me. We would get in some pretty brutal fist fights from time to time (As I did with most other kids my age-ish) The piece of shit who killed her, told him the night before “In prison if you’re getting beat up, you bite the guy in the dick” (He spent 10 years for manslaughter for killing his brother…. Tried to shoot his girlfriend and his brother stepped in the way.) While I’m punching him, he got knocked down to his knees. Proceeded to bite me in the fucking dick. I pummeled his face for that bullshit.

Saving my little brother.
This happened WAYYYYYY the fuck back. After we had just moved to the new house from the trailer. I was 4-5-6. Lil future drownedy drown bro was a wee fookin cunt sleeping in his crib. Form some reason I woke up in the middle of the night and checked on him…. Probably around 4 am. Told my mom “Zach is turning funny colors”. She shoo’ed me off then realized what I had said. Immediately jumped up and ran in the bedroom. Baby zach’s crib was next to the window blinds. He had rolled over and gotten the cord wrapped around his neck. He was blue when she found him. I don’t know why I woke up and checked on him, but it saved his life and the crib was no longer next to the blinds.
Enough of this fucky mcfuck fuck for right now. Don’t want to delve any deeper into previously repressed memories. Let’s get on to the real start of the downward spiral I call a fucking life.

Tweet1
	No, not a twittery tweet, Tweet was a nickname he despised at first, then kinda grew into. He was a twiggy alien looking fuck with big goddamn eyes, looked like tweety from the cartoons. Or because he sang like a fucking bird when in trouble. Not sure. I first met him around 16-17. Working at mcdonalds. He was an ex con, probably 10 years older than me. First day I met him we smoked a joint in the parking lot on break. Became my new weed dealer and started selling me/fronting me Vicodin. More on him later.
Motherfucking Jaime.
	This fucking guy. Had a job at mcd’s. for a short few months.
Fuck.
I don’t wanna blame anyone. But fuck. The amount of shenanigans we got into were ridiculous. We eventually became co-dependent. Like Russia and US in the cold war. Mutually fucking assured destruction. 
He was even older than tweet, or the same age, or younger. Mid 30’s. He had a “back injury” and got prescribed vikes. Had a girlfriend, 2 stepkids. Was a coach for his stepson’s baseball or football or fooseball team or something. I remember back in the day waiting for half time or something so he could sell me some of the sweet little somethings in his pocket. Little 10 year old ginger fuck and his “sports”. Anyway, His girlfriend (Kinda hefty with widespread down syndrome looking eyes) eventually got tired of his shit. Moved out with her kids and then the shit fan really got started. 
	After I came back from college (More on that later). I hooked back up with him. He was living alone, heavily using Fentanyl patches because his pill hook ups were running dry. One day I asked if I could come over and if he was good. He said he was. I get there and he has over 20 bags of dope in front of him. Turns out someone He knew from high school, (2 fucking decades ago) talked to him and was slangin that good dope. Those were the superman dope times (Shit was fire)
	At first, I refused to do anything but snort it. Then only skin popping until I got an abcess in my arm. One day while broke and sick, He offered me 2 free bags and 2 dilaudid “IF and only IF he could shoot me up right with it” He said it would change my life. Little did I fucking know…
	Can’t look. I don’t hate needles per se. Getting tattoos was fine. For my first I was so doped up I laughed because it kinda tickled. I could skin pop, fine. I hated OTHER motherfuckers putting needles IN me. Like deep in me. Probing around. I’m sweaty sick, it was probably summer but I can’t recall. That. Fucking. Rush.
	When motherfuckers talk about addicts trying to re-live “that first rush” I want to say it’s bullshit. But it fucking isn’t. 16 mg of hydromorphone and 2 bags of fire ECP for the first i.v. shot in years is insane.
….
I woke up. It had been two hours, Jaime was nodded the fuck out with a lit cigarette in his hand sitting next to me on the couch. It was dark, I had missed calls from my parents. Quietly excused myself and 3 free bags (rude to wake him right?) and left.
	Ugh. That’s enough of that fuck for now. Want to meet the next fuckin fuck in my series of fuck ups?

Motherfucking Juan (50-fucking something)
	The friend from highschool, Jaime had met, was a woman, M.
She’s the only one I wont name by her name. She genuinely seemed motherly (Motherfucking superior?), liked me, and was a sucker for sad puppy eyes when sick and broke. I could always get her for a free bag, place to stay, or some housework to give me a bag. Our falling out sucks. The way she lived her life sucks. She is a gentle soul, who met an ex con she loves, who knew one way to make money.
	Motherfucking juan. First thing I notice. His eyes are black. No fucking color to his iris. Not dark brown. Fucking black, I shit you not. It looked like all pupil. 5’3”-ish, shorter than me, but kinda ripped. Like bruce lee ripped. But, more Prison-ey. He moved in the apartment above Jaime. With M, and her child. One day he came down for his daily visit to Motherfucking Jaime. Turns out he wanted to get cable but had bad credit from being in prison for 20 years for murder/some other bullshit he told me. Offered me one free bag a month to put his cable/electric under my name.
One free fucking bag a month, fuck yeah. Here’s my ssn. (Being sick and broke is a helluva not-drug)
Didn’t let me deal with him direct cause Jaime was there.
A while later, after Jaime’s use got un-manageable, he was telling me bags were $20+ and didn’t tell me he was taking half out.
	Bought one from Jaime, but it was also free bag day. Went up to Juan’s apartment. “What’s the dilly chillie willie?” I showed him what J had given me and asked why they were 20 per. He laughed.
“Fucking Jaime. You don’t deal with him anymore. You come straight to me, I’ll give you a deal, mmmmm $15 a bag!”
Fucker probably got me for 10 Bundles after that before he dropped it to $10/bag or $70 a bundle.

Jaime was pissed he lost a cash cow, but fuck that fuckin fuck.
Going through juan, I did the next logical thing for an unemployed junkie. Started selling and pushing it on people asking me about pills….

	Standard text back and forth.
	“Any V’s or P’s?” 
“Nahhh, but opiates still.”

“Like what? Patches?”

“Nah, boy though.”
“Oh im good.”

15 minutes pass and they couldn’t find anything else.

“Hey can you still get that”
“Yeah lets ride out”
(15 minute drive to the spot. Make them park a block away cause para-fucking-noid juan, and so I have time to tap their bags (If I was really hurting)… Take half outta each one, sell them at the price I get em for, but with one free bag for me. That was my charge.)
 Which reminds me of some fucking bamboozelery.
Middleman Diaries.
	So. After a year or so…. I believe I was 23-25. Kind of a blur (remember that near photographic memory?). I had what I’ll call my “Good summer”. I had 10-15 people who copped through me to Juan or other sources (for a small fucking fee of course.) I kept juan in the money. For living in a small town, I was kind of making bank. If I didn’t put it up my fucking arm constantly. For at least 3 months one summer I brought him over $1,000 (Sometimes $2,000) a day. I got buns for $60 at this point, charged $100+ a free bag). 
Fuck. Lets talk about some custies now.
I was on probation at this fucking point. It sucked, but I lied/cheated/faked my way through it. More on that later.

I am trying to titrate off of U-47700. I had no idea how short of a half-life this chemical has and after frequently redosing exponential amounts for a week and half, I know I withdraw is bound to happen. 

Anyways, because of how quickly the effects ware off, I am wondering if anyone has experience or has heard of methods to increase the longevity of the drugs effects (or even how to potentiate the effects) so I can take smaller amounts and not feel desparate to redose.

Perhaps it is not possible to level off of U4 the same way as other (pharma grade) opiates. 

Any advice is appreciated! My ultimate goal is to quite and never order this stuff again. If it means suffering cold turkey then so be it, just thought I'd ask around✌🏻️",1494628487.0

I haven't used regularly in a few years and my wife only lets me use about twice a year the last 4 years. My tolerance obviously isn't what it was when I used regularly and it's probably pretty close to baseline now. Although, there seems to be a cross tolerance with the 35g of Kratom I use per day and I'll tell you why I suspect that. 

Last time I got some Lortabs and ate 4 of them, felt nothing and ate my 5th 45 minutes later. Still barely nothing. I was super disappointed. 

Since I only get to do this twice a year, I don't want to be disappointed and I want to get it right this time. Anyone got advice on how many MG of percocet I should take? Is it possible that Kratom blocks up my receptors or something?

Edit: just incase anyone runs into this comment wondering about opiate Kratom cross tolerance, I took 50mg of oxycodone and felt a slight high, I didn't get the nod I was looking for unfortunately. Keep in mind that I had not used opiates for about a year, so I should have 0 tolerance. Seems to me that Kratom has a major effect on opiate tolerance, at least at my level of consumption.

Once I got hooked, I never felt like working out, I know my test levels were so low, never having a libido is proof. Plus I was taking DHC which is converted to morphine and codiene and makes you crave sweets which I never touched before, and it makes you incredibly boated. Anyone that has detoxed for a few weeks can vouch on the massive weight lost.

I have some knowledge on steroids from the past, and thought about self-administration test-prop to increase my test levels and hopefully get me back and Keep Me in the gym until I see results. I am about -240lb but was 210-220lbs before opiates, it was all muscle from training for so long, which isn't the case now. 

I don't want to bloat up even more which is why I have water-based prop and some things like armidex and Nolva.

I would love to go to a doc for blood tests but I don't get opiates from a script. I am trying to taper down to Kratom and I know from experience that after a few weeks, the workouts help that depression and just getting out helps. This post is more for long term abusers, I'm in my older 30s. I used to gain so much self esteem from fitness and when I stopped is was a big reason for my depression that I kept using opiates to hide because I was in so deep, my physical change was a dead giveaway to many that something was wrong. 

I got clean for 3 weeks but I still was a mess and I broke down and took kratom thinking it was at least the weakest and was surprised how well it got me to leave and get exercise. This last for a few months but It eventually made workouts worse and I got injured and couldn't workout. However, working out, cardio specifically gives me something positive and something to look forward to. In a way I feel it's the key to me getting clean.

I have some anavar coming as well for fat lose, I just hope the test-prop doesn't make me look even more bloated, even though I eat clean when I get into training and focus a lot on cardio and weights.

My experience is purely anecdotal, and my opinion is my opinion, But for context, I was coming off shooting about 2.5-3 bundles a day. I was able to control my symptoms with 3 mg at induction and taper off subs completely in a week. There is plenty of incentive for physicians to over prescribe medication... so think about that before you agree to go on some years long suboxone replacement treatment. 


Day 1: 

3 mg suboxone

4 300 mg gabapentin

2 seroquel 

4 loperamide tabs.



I waited 20 hours after my last shot, and took the sub around 5 in the morning when I was really sweaty, anxious and my heart rate elevated. I then took the seroquel, which knocked me the fuck out until about 3 pm the next day. No shitting or puking, thank god. I ate some mac and cheese, and watched Netflix. 

Day 2: 

2 mg suboxone

2 300 mg gabapentin

1 seroquel

I woke up around 11 am, and ate a PBJ. This detox was surprisingly easy and asymptomatic. My girlfriend was waiting for me to be puking, screaming and shitting. Hot and cold flashes happened throughout the day, but nothing I couldn't handle.

Day 3:

1 mg Suboxone

2 300 mg gabapentin

Again, another pretty uneventful day. No horrible symptoms. Ate, slept, fucked.

Day 4:

 Meth

I took no meds on day 4, but did smoke some meth when I started getting a little antsy. Girlfriends roommate is a stupid rich meth head, he suggested I try it. To be honest, it alleviated every single mental symptom I had, but I didn't get ""high"". Weird.

Day 5: 

1 mg Suboxone

This morning I woke up anxious as FUCK. Like freaking out, wanting to blow my brains out. She held me, I took the sub, and about an hour after that it alleviated.


After that, I took tiny tiny pieces of the strip when I felt compelled to, and I'm currently 5 days or so off them completely. I do drink sometimes when I get anxious, but other that I'm completely clean! Ask me whatever you want in the comments and I will try to help.

I passed out last night thinking how lucky I was that this withdrawal hasn't really been shit because I've had subs and mostly felt better off of like 2-3 mg, even though I've had a 1.5 g/day habit. Also have some clonidine (the RLS and anxiety are the worst parts by far for me, so I've been pretty straight, even though I know it's early). Took a shit ton of vitamins last night, woke up this morning, bed soaking wet, which is no big deal. But my stomach starts cramping so fucking bad. I've had bad stomach aches, but this one had me keeled over on the ground. Couldn't even stand up. So I'm sitting on the toilet, and I know there's a shit ton of liquidy poison blocked up by the dehydrated pellets that I have to forcefully and patiently push out, all while I'm sweating from the excruciating pain. And it goes through waves where my shit will get progressively softer. I know this game, and it's the fucking worst. So I switch from shoving glycerin suppositories up my ass, praying it'll help get through each progressive wave faster, so I can expel the liquid poison demon from my bowels as quickly as possible, to sitting on the toilet, beads of sweat dripping down my face, just rocking back and forth from the pain begging for it to stop. ""Please get soft, shit. Please get to the soft part, so at least I know I'm close."" Suddenly, I get really thirsty, and the thought comes to my head. I wonder if I'll throw up. I learned the trick of chugging water to throw up when you had to recover a swallowed stash. I had no idea how the fuck I was gonna be able to drink water when my stomach felt like the Alien was about to rip a hole through it and pop out. But I chugged the water. Immediately started getting nauseous, and grabbed the little trash can by my toilet and start puking the most sour, nasty vomit, and it goes right up my sinuses, so it's coming out my mouth and my nose. It stings so bad, and I can't breathe, but I'm just puking handfuls into this little bucket meanwhile, I can feel crap finally coming out of my ass. This lasted about 10 more minutes until it was out of both ends. Immediately went to go brush my teeth and do whatever I could to get the taste out caused by the lingering vomit in my sinuses (though I couldn't do much, and every breath I took made me gag). I crawled in bed, so weak and fucking traumatized. Holy shit, that was a first. Worst fucking thing I've ever had to endure. Holy fuck. I was just shaking after. Thought you fellow junkies could maybe relate to the trauma. Kicking is no fucking joke. But I'm still junk free, and if I can make it through that shit-vomit-can't-breathe-sweating-from-the-excruciating-pain trauma, I know I got this. Pray for me, fam.",1494610251.0

I would've slept so amazing (I have a hard time sleeping any night) if it wasnt for the fact that I kept having to go pee. Which obviously didn't happen. (my poor man kept waking up as I was climbing over him to get out of bed). The one time I was able to pee I was passed out cold until he woke up. He woke up kinda groggy like. I didn't think anything of it because I wouldn't think I would feel a thousand times worse. When I finally got up to start my day. Laundry. You know. Household responsibilities, I was just so nauseated and my head was pounding. He felt better as soon as he had coffee. Now we're at IHOP and I feel better now that I had coffee in me. (thank God, I don't do nausea well. At all.)

 Anyway id got rigs and needles and filter needles since i had been shooting my Subutex literally just for the needle fix as it gave no euphoria. When i got coke I'd shoot that too which is always a wild ride that always ends in awful track marks and bruises and self loathing.   


 After a a few weeks when i ran out of needles i decided not to buy any more since it's the last thing is needed. I still had half a box of the filter needles though, which are 18g, 5micron filter, and say not to be used for injection and look truly impressive and terrifying.   

I'd gotten more blow a few days ago and In coke fueled desperation and as a junkie i caught a yen for the C in my veins and i obviously wasn't going to let a warning stop me from catching that bell ringer so i grabbed the last syringe tube and loaded her up.   

My God did I manage to get that 2.07mm wide needle with its kinda but not really sharp enough tip into my ragged mainline, register and blast away. It was awful because of the force I had to use to get the fucker to break through the vein. Obviously as soon as the tip of the needle gets through the blood starts coming out of the vein and pooling, since the ""hole"" of the needle still hadn't gone all the way through the vein and ""plugged"" it, so you end up with an instant bruise. When the needle is pulled out a large amount of blood shot out onto my arm and even with elevation and pressure wouldn't stop bleeding for a few minutes. I still managed to register with the filter needle and get a nice ringer even though the next 15 minutes were spent with my in warm water with a compress on it and sweat dripping off my face and my arms held above my head for the rest of the night.   

went through that torturous process 11 times throughout the night, once for each shot and i luckily hit the first time for 7/11 shots with that monster of a needle. Suffice to say that my veins are gonna take a while to heal from this one.

Just wanted to share how I prep my shot, and if people ever do this. I will try to explain the best I can.

I put my dope in a spoon as always, add 70 units of filtered water at 98 degrees. I mix it up for a couple minutes and get my cotton around. I try to get my cotton as tight as possible and wet it first so it doesn't swell up and loosen when I put it in my spoon. I don't heat my solution, just draw it up normally. Onto the next part....

I take another syringe, pull out the plunger and add roughly 20 units of cotton in it when it's compressed. I then take my syringe that's full and squirt it into the other syringe with the cotton in it. I then put the plunger in and squeeze out the solution back into the spoon. Then of course i draw it back up one last time, and it is ready. This makes it much moire clean, and it's basically like filtering it 5 times. A nice clean shot. I started doing this when I was injecting morphine pills that had a lot of unwanted filler material I did not want in my system.

Now I know micron filter's are a better and safer way to do things, but if you just have cotton, this method really works well. Especially for people with large habits shooting a lot of powder. With ecp it's not a huge deal, but with bth, I feel like this is a must.

Also what's the difference in the process that makes it into black goo, instead of beautiful soft brown to grey to whiteish powder? Any insight from any of you amateur drug chemists would be much appreciated. Happy nods frends.

Bonus question: Why do they only get heroin base (#3) in europe? Are their cartel chemists too lazy to take it all the way to #4? Or maybe they lack the know how, it maybe it's just plain cheaper. Pls weigh in.

Type: Whatever H I've been getting in individually bagged doses.
Usage: Pretty consistently, see below.

**Day 0**, any day before Thursday in which I was using every day. Some days used 4, others 3, and 5 on one of them. After this the taper is started and is documented below.

**Day one, Thursday:** Don't remember but maybe it was up to 4 bags. 

**Day two, Friday:** 3 bags over the course of the entire day.

**Day three, Saturday:** 1 bag consumed 14 hours after Friday's last bag. Eight hours later, after dinner a friend shared a ""bump"" from that he saved from his own line.

...

The following days have not transpired yet since it is presently Saturday night when I am writing this post...

**Day four, Sunday:** 1 bag left. Starting work at 9 AM until 8PM. The plan is to not consume the bag in the morning as I normally would when I have more on hand but to wait till later in the day to consume it. I'll most likely wait til mid day.. perhaps my lunch break or ""bathroom break"". 

Although a friend may get me something like half a bun until pay day, I'm going to work off the assumption that I will not be able to get anything else until Wednesday.
______________________________________________

Based on the assumption that will be my last bag tomorrow and the end of my taper: what can I expect? Will I be able to look forward to appreciably reduced symptoms?

..

**Update 1:**

**Sunday 8AM:**
Woke up at 7, ate some breakfast. Noticed that it felt really cold in my room although the temperature indoors is 72 F. I chalked it up to the discomfort of reduced blood flow in the morning and having a thick skin for lack of dope in my system which which would help to raise body temp. I'm pretty sure my morning dump was normal though the second one seemed a tad closer to diarrhea than normal. Thought about taking lope, though I only have the liquid version and it's a year beyond expiration.

Read the first comment, which made me realize that maybe I was feeling some symptoms or kicked me to psycho-somatic overdrive. Well, I justified using my last bag right now because it can be hard to find a place of seclusion at work to do a bag of dope. The risk of trouble is much lower if I do it at home and I know my body will function for the next twelve hours until work is over. I mean like watery nose, sneezing a bit and stomach sensations were already present so I probably was experiencing light symptoms. They've seemed to have subsided after snorting a bag. 

I may or may not get lucky tonight, my friend may be able to spot me half a bundle if I give him $20 later. I plan to convert $20 from coinage to dollars to make that happen and have access to a place to do that. I also have a way to legitimately make $50 after work but I'm not counting on that individual to show up. Last time they were supposed to show up they gave me some excuse they were running late for work then a day later when I went to reschedule they said they couldn't see me until today when they get paid. He'll show sooner or later, just no guarantee that it'll be today or tomorrow.

I'm confident that I can get by with two bags per day until pay day. That I can even get through today and get a good night's sleep even if that requires the help of a little benzo. Just from experience with this before, audiobooks are a wonderful. Sci-fi buffs are welcome to PM me if they want a recommendation for the most amazing sci-fi book ever. It got me out of depression one evening and ignited my imagination for days after. 

Regarding kicking it.. if I choose to kick once the hard work days are out of the way, provided that I have the option to continue using between pay day via divine providence, this is one of those weeks where it can be done. The colder days have a nasty bite for anyone who stops using whether you're an IV user or snorting at the kiddie table like myself. 

If you live on the east coast, temperatures during the days will be in the mid 70s (F) by Tuesday. Last time I kicked and survived symptoms it felt so good seeing light at the end of the short tunnel. The good weather helped tremendously. Saturday is projected to be the coldest day and even then it won't be too bad. Per 10 day forecasts, next week will have lots of rain but the temperatures won't be horrific. 

**The reason I mention the weather is because this week offers a lot of folks in the community a good time to deal with symptoms on favorable terms.** 

On a side note/question: What is it like going through withdrawal symptoms on a hot summer day? A friend said it wasn't so pleasant but I didn't get around to asking him why yet. I have my theories but I'm sure some of the members of this community could share some perspective on that. Thank you for being an outlet to write, vent, inquire and participate. Be well, and stay safe!

    So last night I buy one measly overpriced point and I smoke it like the usual in about 5 or 6 hoots over the course of 2 hours. As I'm laying in bed thinking of how underwhelming this high is, I decide to shoot a message to my roommate. ""Hey girl what's good you got any stuff? I will throw ya ten bucks for a hoot"". She tells me to come to her room and she gives me a tiny chunk of some pink shit that looks like a shard off a pepto bismol tablet or some shit. Like this piece was the size of maybe half a match head and she's like this is stronger shit don't tell our d girl I gave it to you she saves it for her clients that she knows have tolerances, but its such a little piece you will be fine I wouldn't give ya a full point of it.

 So I proceed to the washroom and put it on the foil, I remember it was such a tiny hoot it barely sizzled on the foil. My roommate heard me hit the floor and she immediately started trying to bring me back spraying me with water and all that shit. She is a medic in the oilfield here so she has higher than normal first aid training and shit. Narcan and paramedics is a shitty way to wake up. Of course being a small town one of the paramedics is a crusty old fuck who just so happened to be at my last overdose about a month and a half ago so he was an absolute cunt to me. But anyways two ODs in two months I think its time for me to hang the skates up I'm done this shit is just far too dangerous. Fucking fent grrr",1494725478.0

So fam, I've been a member of this sub for a while now, and uhh I have an issue. 
After quite a few years of doing Heroin (3-4 years), I have decided to finally take the leap-- to go ahead and give shooting a run for a bit. 

Unlike many, I have quite the self control over opiates (including heroin!).

I know a lot of people say that it is nearly impossible to control yourself after taking the big jump to the needle. 

But the thing is, last night, for the first time ever I was with my close friend who happened to just pick up a fresh pack of rigs. I went ahead and asked him if I could get one of his fresh rigs and he shot me up but now today I'm sitting here poking my arm reading a shit ton of valuable information like this ""Getting off right"" guide here:

http://harmreduction.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/getting-off-right.pdf

And watching YouTube videos from medical professionals showing how to hit a vein properly in hands/ arms / etc.

From all of the information I've gathered so far, from watching my friend shoot me up and from seeing so many of my friends shoot up in the past and most recently, I just can't understand why the fuck I can't seem to hit ANY vein in my arms and hands. 

It's like my arms aren't really veiny to be honest, even though I'm properly hydrated and I went to the little gym set up in my house & worked out for a good 45 minutes or so, plus I did push ups to really get the blood flowing in my arms-- so far I've pricked my arm and hands about 20 times in estimation, with plenty of little marks all over my hands and arms now I've decided to take a break.. 

My question is, why why why is this so difficult? So far I keep trying to pull back to see if I registered (checking if I see any blood  when I pull back) but it doesn't wanna hit a vein! 

Maybe I am pushing the needle in too far? Am I supposed to try and pull back to check if I get any blood multiple times AS I am pushing the needle in further? Is it normal to have like half of the needle in as opposed to pushing the needle all the way in to where the point is completely hidden in my arm? Any help would be really appreciated.

I know the taste of Oxy well, and from what I've read Fent doesn't have the same taste.  That said, I don't know if that's true and I don't know what fent tastes like.

(what would it look like?),"So we all know the war on drugs is a mess. No doubt here. I have a cousin who was addicted to heroin and xanax for a few years. I have another cousin who is starting to fuck with heroin. Most of the kids from my high school who are fucked from drugs are depressed from too much E. I know very few who opies really affected. (I live in Cali. perhaps its just my town?)


But anyways, if oxy, H, and morphine were legalized and made available and cheap, would you (or any other addict) be able to function normally? Ie go to school? Class? It seems in pure form, used responsibly, the damage opies cause to people lives is greatly diminished. But I presume that one would still struggle with addiction. What would the life of the avg opie addict look like in this world? I want to say that at least people would be off the streets?

I mean I doubt that opie users could blend in the same way that coffee drinkers and cig smokers blend in. Would an opie addict function like an extreme version of a pothead? Just kind of watching TV and not harming those around him? But missing out on oppurtunities in life?

NO doubt in my mind whatsoever. drugs should not be criminalized. But making opies legal and available to the 21+ crowd seems like a bold move. Given how opies have ruined lives, I am skeptical that this would be the best solution. I think decriminalization and making treatment much more available would work better. ie iboga and kratom should be HEAVILY subsidized

thoughts? **tl:dr; how would a responsible opie addict function if all all drugs became legalized?**

FYI I am just a lurker. I tried every drug besides heroin, meth and crack in the past. I stopped and I am now sober outside of beer and shrooms. I am just coming to just get some opinions.

6bb2p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6bb2p7/theories_on_tapering/,0,https://redd.it/6bb2p7,sloan_fitch,Theories on tapering...,"[Last post.. was a shitpost of sorts](https://ac.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6b1ptg/shit_happens_sometimes_youre_lucky_enough_for_it/) 

This post is mostly about H but can be applicable to oxys. Even so, I've tapered off dope (H) that was obtained as I was running out of oxys. So I've never tested results with jumping off or tapering off oxys. Many of us may already know what it's like jumping off of oxys after multiple days + a couple of weeks on another opiate.

It has come to mind that tapering may be a good way to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Upon some web searching it turns out that it's possible. Others have indicated ""barely noticeable"" or fairly reduced symptoms.

**For oral ROA**, provided that one has self control then I'd say success with tapering has the best odds of success without experiencing strong ill effects. There's a lot of decent material on this. I read one how-to that went on for WEEKS. I think even that was too long but I'm sure you'd feel no symptoms if it was drawn out that long. In the case of dope I think we can agree that may be too long not to succumb to temptation. Also impossible if you're gonna run out in less than a week.

**For snorting**, of course you've already been chasing a more instant rush and probably raised that tolerance ceiling considerably higher. The shit post details my account on precisely how much I was using as I began and conducted my taper.

**For IV**, okay this is where the theories come in. I have no experience with this whatsoever but I suspect some of the postings I've read where folks are inquiring about tapering were from IV users. My theory being, this is the most challenging type of taper. To go further I don't know the mechanics of it. Like does someone do a full shot on a less frequent basis or do they turn it into a half a shot at some point in time? 

Last theory on IV tapering... I suspect that after tapering down while using the IV one may be able to switch to snorting H and then taper that down. Not sure if it's been done but I'd like to think that this may be an option for some who wish to avoid or reduce withdrawal symptoms.

A few hours went by and I really wasn't feeling a lot, so I just decided to fall asleep with it on and see how I felt in the morning with enough time to let it build up a bit. I woke up feeling a bit buzzed but still not really a noticeable effect. The day went on, I just lounged around, kind of just trying to make the most of the tiny bit I was feeling.

Eventually I got fed up with how little I was feeling and about 3 hours ago (nearly 24 hours after first putting the patch on) I took it off and decided to gum/suck on the patch for about 5-10 minutes. I started to feel a bit more of a buzz, quite enjoyable, but a tiny bit of nausea, but that was expected from what I read. Another hour went by and I wasn't feeling floored by it so I decided to chew it a little, and again I felt a little more buzzed, but still not much of a 'wow' factor to it. About 40 minutes ago I just chewed up the whole thing and sucked on it until I was certain nothing was left. It's still not ""wow, omg"" or anything, and the nausea is a little off putting, but it's still a very nice pleasant glow.

Thing is, I thought 5mg would be *way* too much from the dosing reports and recommendations I was given.

20-25mg of oxy will give me a *strong* nod, for comparison. So what gives? Why did the bupe have such a smaller effect than I was expecting?",1494857094.0

First I'd like to apologize for the lengthy post. I've never told this story before.
On May 17, 2016 I received the worst phone call of my entire life. My boyfriend of three years committed suicide by overdose. We were living together at the time, but had went to my mom's house because ""T"" and I got in a fight that day before. T and I were both in college, we had an adorable cat named Peanut, our own apartment, great jobs and were totally in love. We both had an addiction problem, but T also had schizophrenia, bi-polar disorder, anxiety, and depression. We had seen so many doctors trying to find the right type of medicine to combat the voices in his head, the mood swings, the paranoia, etc. He told me opiates were the only thing that fixed all of his problems, and to be honest I thought it was just excuse to use, until he stopped taking his meds and started sniffing dilaudids. In complete honesty though T WAS better. He was just so much better. He was happy, he didn't hear voices, he didn't wake up from nightmares, he was HAPPY. We both did dillys together, I knew it was wrong, but we all know the cycle of addiction. Eventually our dealer went to jail and that's when we found doap. It was only a little bit at first. Then he started shooting. I've never done it, but seeing him the way he was, damn did I think about it all the time. We did this for about two years and then T and I decided it was time to get our shit together. He went off to rehab for thirty days in April 2016, and I detoxed off suboxones while he was away. I was finally feeling optimistic because I knew we were both making the right decision, but was scared that all of his illnesses and all of his old medications wouldn't work like last time. I had been in relationships before, but I was in love with him, so I had to be strong and be the best girlfriend I could possibly be. He came home May 1st. We were both finally sober and we were doing so well.. or so I thought. T's new meds weren't working. He was hearing voices, accused me of trying to poison him, had his mood swings again. May 14th 2016; my college graduation day! After an amazing day with family, T and I came home, cuddled up in bed and fell asleep. Around 2 o'clock in the morning, I am fast asleep and jolted awake to T's hands gripping my neck. He was choking me because, once again, he thought I was trying to poison him. I truly believed that if I didn't kick him in the nuts he might have killed me. The morning after, May 16th 2016, he went out and got doap. I couldn't say no when he came home and we both relapsed. He started to cry, which made me cry. We both just didn't know what to do. The voices in his head had their grip on him.  Doap fixed everything for him and I loved him so much that I convinced myself that it was okay for him to do it, because I wanted him to be happy, I wanted my babe back. My T. We got in a fight that night over our use, relapse, etc. I decided that I would spend that night at my mom's house as the fight was pretty bad and we both needed some space. The last thing I said to him was, ""You're pissing me off. Don't talk to me."" That was the last thing I ever got to say to the only man I actually fell head over heels in love with. May 17, 2016, 10:04 pm. I get a call from T's mom. My heart immediately sunk to my stomach. ""Megan I'm so sorry sweetheart. I don't know how to tell you this, but Tyler's gone."" Later I found that he had commited suicide. He was supposed to do something for his mom, and after he didn't call or text her. She decided to stop by our place only to hear T's phone ringing inside and Peanut meowing uncontrollably. She called the police and the rest is how you think it would go. The note? ""[parents, sister, me] Thank you for everything you've done for me. I love you all so much.""
It will be a year since his death on Wednesday and I still feel completely numb, heart broken, and GUILTY. We were together for three years and I couldn't tell that something was wrong? That he must have been depressed? I should've been there to help him. I should have never left our apartment that night, never said such hurtful words as I left the apartment. He died knowing that the last thing I said to him wasn't I love you. Why didn't he try to call me? Why didn't I call or text him that whole day? I should have never left the apartment that night, he might still be alive if I stayed home that night. We would've celebrated our four year anniversary April 29th this year. I have so much guilt and sadness running through me that somedays I don't even leave my bed.  I never truly knew the meaning of love and heartbreak; the feeling of complete loss and emptiness..until the presence of his absence hurt just as much as the absence of his presence. For those that have read this far, thank you. I have never told this story to anyone. Just bits and pieces, the ""in a nut shell"" story. I really need someone to talk to, someone who might have been through a similar experience. I have so many questions. I have never felt more alone in my entire life. I feel that I lost my future and that a peice of my heart and soul died that night. The only time I see him now is in my dreams, and every single day I want to fall asleep and dream forever. I don't know what I'm doing anymore, I miss him so much. I fear that one day I won't remember his laugh, his voice, all of our memories we made together. I'm lost and I need guidance. Thank you for this. Allowing me to share our story for the first time, seeking advice and help, it feels good to let it out. He loved Reddit and made me a lurker. I finally made an account and I feel like I've found a second home. I know this post is long, so thank you to those who took the time to read it, it means a lot to me. Xo. ",1494829187.0

So basically long story short. I need reccomendations on which opioid to graduate to next.

I currently am addicted to codeine and my tolerance is way too high. I take almost near the LD50 for a decent nod and I worry about the damage on my liver as the majority of the time I CWE pills.  The only issue I have is the strongest opiate I can get is dihydrocodeine, which, let's face it is pretty much just codeine with less itching.  I was thinking morphine or oxy though I have no way of getting it. In the UK you have to be VERY ill  to get anything stronger than codeine and tramadol. I can order drugs via a friend on DNM's though the cost of oxy on there is insane and I rarely find morphine.  Heroin is very cheap but the social stigma attatched to it puts me off and I worry about my friends reaction to me asking for H



What drug opiate would you reccomend. 

Is £30 for 30mg of oxy a good price in the UK?

A couple days ago I posted about how happy I was to find a plug for the pills I like so much at my new job. Well anyway this job was a lot harder than anything I have ever had to do before in my life. I've had 18 years of things being given to me all the time. 

This place is an Italian restaurant so the names of the food were really hard for my uncultured little brain to learn and memorize. My feet hurt from walking around for hours on end during busy night. I was about to give up hope and just go get a job somewhere where I could sit in a cubicle and look at Reddit all day. Not to mention I sucked at everything I did and couldn't memorize the menu for shit so my manager told me I needed to step up my game or he would have to let me go.

But then my new dealer swooped in with a baggie of hydros and xanax I asked him to bring me! I popped some pills and all the sudden I knew the entire menu like the back of my hand. My feet didn't hurt and my mood went from annoyed and miserable to happy and I got that ""I don't really care what I'm doing cause I'm high as fuck"" feeling going for me!

Well then I was on top of it. My manager was impressed with my work the past few days while i was high and I felt great the whole time I was there too!

Or I would take a sub then a few hours later try and over ride it and smoke a lot of H. The problem that really effects me is when I'm trying to get clean I take subs but they don't work I still have terrible withdrawals so that's why a few hours later I'll end up doing H. Has anyone had this happen or have any advice to get my receptors back to normal, I know not to keep doing the H but I need to get clean and want to but can't deal with the withdrawals, my life is to busy and I have to keep up with appearances so I have no down time to be sick.

Here is the reason why essentially.

So I am getting 15's at the moment and I feel like literally 5 more mgs might make significant difference in bringing my pain down to a decent tolerable level that I will be comfortable with. I have only been with my PM doc for about 3 months but I have essentially been going to see him like 3 times a month. We have really been trying hard to control this pain. I feel like just being straight up and suggesting that maybe a small titration like , 5 mg, will make a difference. That would bring me to a 20 mg script. Because of my age and the fact that my script just got upped recently, I do not think it is a good idea to suggest in anyway going up to 30s. I also do not want my tolerance to build up that quickly. But, If I do get the 20's, I might have to get the script 3-4 days before I run out each time since they seem to be more rare.

Now normally the bags are the average size for the stamps I get but yesterday he sold my friend a bundle and my friend hit me up so pissed off saying that the bags were tight (tiny) as fuck! 

When my friend told me this I was in disbelief because I've been seeing this connect for a long time now and I've never had any issues at all.. 

But check this out... 

I went to pick up a few bags off of him and I didn't even look at the size before I got out of his car, because I never have had any sort of issue even yesterday when my friend complained about his bundle.

Bags from Dealer A my friend complained about: https://anonimage.net/gallery/xEScQauUgy

Now since I grabbed a half bun and ALL of the bags were this size I got so pissed off bc once I told my connect they were too small and he needs to make it right he began to ignore me! 

Since he ignored me, I went and hit up one of my old connects that I hadn't seen in a year-- and peep these bags he sold me-- ten bucks a piece instead of $40 for a half bun, but look at the difference!

Bags from dealer B, old connect I just saw today for first time in over a year: https://anonimage.net/gallery/eMn5awmua

So my point of making this post isn't to brag about my bag size (lol) but more so to ask my fellow bropiates- why the fuck would any dealer even THINK that those A+ red stamp bags were OKAY in size? Like what the Fuck? They aren't even worth $5 IMO! I literally am going to save those until this guy hits me back and I'm gonna give them back and either get my money back or trade them for new bags.. I know he will pull through just crazy how he won't answer why would he even risk losing a customer that spends nearly a grand every week?  I must be too kind hearted or something.. doesn't make sense to me..

Oh and funny thing is I actually sent Dealer A with the shitty tight bags a picture of those NWO bags (means new world order some conspiracy theory) and said ""this is what a normal bag should look like buddy"" and he's probably like what the fuck was I even thinking selling tiny ass one line bags like that? 😂👌

Mind you I know a majority of this dealers clientele and I already told every single one of them how tight the bags are now so none of them are hitting him up any more until it's resolved, I have plenty of leverage since I've been in this game for so long!

**UPDATE:** I've been nodding hard as fuck allll day long because I got those NWO stamps from my old connect, and boy was that a smart move! So what happened with the A+ red stamps you ask? If you are wondering, like I had said in the comments here, I actually didn't blow the guy up as I am not that kind of person. When something like this happens, or if I get completely beat by someone for any drug-- heroin to cannabis-- I don't just let it fly and continue to help them make money but I also don't just sit there and blow their phone up calling it and texting it over and over. The best thing I could do is just wait it out and see if he truly wants my business or not. Sure enough, guess what happened? He finally just hit me up and said he got me with 2 fat bags of a brand new batch that just came in. 

Just goes to show if you don't bother them, don't blow up their phone, and some how make it known that you have a big impact on their flow of business you will get what's yours.

So I recently had around 90 days clean and a couple of weeks ago I thought ""y'know what im doing pretty good maybe I can do this every once in awhile..."" NOPE. This chipping thing definitely ain't working and it seems I'm back to full on shitty active addiction and dopesickness. I feel like an idiot. Things started going great for me once I got sober. I got a new job. A new house. A new amazing boyfriend (who's a fucking chairperson at NA I might add... who would drop my ass in a heartbeat if he found out I was using again...). Not to mention, I just fucking finished a 90 day out-patient program with 30 days of in-patient prior. I really thought that things were starting to look up. It's like no matter how great things are going in my life, I'm not truly happy unless I'm high. I wish I didn't love getting faded..

Anyone else have this problem where the fuck up everything good they've got going for absolutely no reason?

/end rant. /shitpost over.
