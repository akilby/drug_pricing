I’m a 24 year old girl, had a habit on and off for a few years. Last time I was clean was like 8 or 9 months ago. Anyways I’ve been taking like 4-6 or sometimes like 8 blue 30’s a day. Really whatever I can get my hands on I’ll take lol. I used to take real ones but for the last few months I’ve been snorting fake ones because they’re stronger. Probably fent in them, the guy who sells them to me swears it isn’t but I doubt it. Anyways I’m not going to have any money for the next week, Maybe longer due to some unforeseen shit circumstance and I only have $100 left then that’s it, this girl (me) is so fucked lol, so looks like I’m detoxing. I can either:
A: get about 5-6 more of these fake ones and stretch them out as long as possible then I have a pretty much unlimited supply of subutex to take once I run out and take those for a few days and try to ween off
Or
B: get about 10 10mg methadone pills and try taking those? I took like 7 at a time a few weeks ago and only they seemed to only work for 12 -15hours and I was hurtin again so I’m nervous to do this because what if I fuck myself and only get one good dose?

The reason I’m scared of option A is because Ive taken subs twice now and each gone into PWD. Worst. Experience. Ever. The only thing that got me out was taking more fake ones and I had to go thru hell for like 6 hours. But It’s subutex not suboxone and yes I know it’s the bupe not nalaxone that makes you sick. I’m just so afraid to take it again. I waited like 12 hours last time I guess that wasn’t enough. It works fine when my friends do it thats why idk why it won’t work for me. So what’s everyone’s opinion here.",1555816429.0

Figured when a woman who worked their asked if I wanted to try a new flavor that she ment a vape cart😂, not a thc cart. Immediately noticed it was oil but could not resist a nice inhale once I tasted that fruity oil cart. Did not get free food. Got too high and forgot about the food once I realized I had really fucked up. My friends at sober living got a fucking laugh over my lack of thinking. Of fucking course there was oil at a party thrown on 4/20.. even thrown by a vape store, I forget that cali does not work like New York. I'm not even of age to buy recreational weed here being 19 and my med card from home doesn't mean shit here but the lady still asked me to test it out... wonder if she would've let me buy some.. but was it worth it getting toasted on accident?? Does the pope fuck kids? It was totally fucking worth the impending failure of my UA on Monday, haven't smoked in 60 somthing days. They'll call it a ""relapse"", I'm here for heroin crack and xans I have no plans on not smoking tree. I'm honestly feeling better about things than I have the past week. Was struggling with mad cravings for heroin and crack, weed sooths the fucking soul tho did not obsess about it for the first time today. Even with the failure of my UA on the horizon I feel more at peace with my commitment to stay off of the hard shit than I have since I started getting sober in February.

After all the shit, sweat, nightmares and tears I finally got clean. I was able to welcome my sister home from school with a pretty set of eyes rather than the glossed void leading to anything but me.

She was here for one day before I got in touch with the middle man, who struggles just like I do. He got me what I wanted because he knew I felt shitty but this was the first time he told me that he respected me because I was the only one in the game that never gave him shit. Never gave him hell for getting arrested with my money. Never asked him to hurry up. Never asked to replace the funds he lost. He told me it hurt him bad each and every time he scored for me.

I have this burning, aching love for each and every soul on this earth that suffers the game of life. I respect everyone for the fight that goes on for each and every one of us. I snuck out my window in bare feet to retrieve the cure from down the road after it was dropped near my home. Stepping in puddles and tripping without a damn care. Upon sneaking in I heard the dog move in my mothers’ room, so I stuck the dope under the bed and began watching videos.

Waited thirty minutes until I finally decided it was the appropriate time to feel better. This was the first time I spent someone else’s money. I made sure all was quiet in the home and racked it up. I took it...

I just started fucking crying. I have everything in the world going for me still even after a few months of active addiction. Scholarships to university after years of struggle in community college engineering programs. I have the most beautiful and loving family that transcends what words can say.

Here I am. High as a kite. Alone in a dark room just as I had planned.

And now, for the first time in my entire life, after all the detoxes and probations and death...

I realized just how sad I am.

I truly, undoubtedly love you all so much.

I make no claim to being special, each and every one of us deserves the chance to make a difference in this world. I would die if it meant getting just one addict clean.

This may not be everyone’s case but for me it is. The sadness, the feeling worthless, self hate or  esteem issues, lack of confidence, tiredness and the many other feelings that opiates used to block out or make 100% better doesn’t last. 

To those out there who take them for fun, for those out there seeking this Reddit thread for info on how to start or where to get the most prescribed........ turn around now. Don’t look back. One day if you happen to need them, don’t take too many, don’t use them for the wrong reasons, use what you need and be done as soon as possible. I know many of the members on this sub would agree with me and know all too well what I’m talking about. You may take them for fun off and on, then start taking them to cope through a bad break up, then end up actually needing them for incurable medical problems, This being my own scenario.

Ultimately they don’t make you feel better. Eventually you will take them and they don’t make you numb to the emotions you wish to not feel, they don’t block the painful memories or situations you wish to have never gone through. One day you will wake up taking one hoping it will make you feel better, just like it used too, but instead you still feel empty, you still feel sad, alone (even if you aren’t).......the point is: you still feel!!!! This is what I’m going through right now. Not even the drugs designed to make you feel good make me feel good anymore. Instead I sit here alone, crying wishing everything was different, wishing I could have felt the things I numbed for so many years instead of feeling them tenfold now.",1555794119.0

but I ran into a couple yesterday, I took half of one to start off with and it knocked me on my ass like no other. thought maybe my tolerance had gone down a little bit since it had been 2 days since I did more than half a 10mg hydrocodone - so I gave it a bit and took the other half that night. knocked me on my ass straight until the morning and part way through the day, both times yesterday they made me throw up. decided to break one into quarters and do bumps of a quarter at a time ( just finished one rn ) and I’m not noticing any lesser effects than when I was bumping halves. 

has this happened to anyone else ?? I’m pretty certain they weren’t pressed bc I saw the script bottle, but anything’s possible. breaking them into quarters made me not throw up but I feel as high as I did doing a half.

I'm a 26-year-old living with my parents for the next 6 months due to weird circumstances with my previous roommates. They (my family) know I use, so they forced me to close my previous bank account and transfer it over to a joint bank account so they can monitor my activity. I'm fortunate enough to make a lot of money for my age, but taking out cash is painfully obvious. Even if I go to a grocery store and get cash they'll know because I don't otherwise spend $100+ dollars at Target.. Unfortunately, my tolerance is at the point where I need at least 120mg of oxy to catch a buzz. They do not drug test me, but that really doesn't make a difference if they can see what I'm doing with my money. It's super embarrassing considering I'm a college graduate with a good career that I've worked hard for. I shouldn't be dealing with this shit from my parents who make maybe half what I do. It's only temporary, but it still fucking pisses me off regardless. I'm usually smart enough to figure a way around this, but I can't. Any advice?",1555787867.0

At my peak I was taking 500mg of tramadol a day, for about 7 months, luckily I never had a seizure, even though I often mixed the 500mg with 2mg of xanax. During this time being I felt wonderful since I always had my ways around with scripts so I had an endless supply of pills. 

&#x200B;

Nevertheless I had to taper off the pills for various reason and it's been one week since I popped some tramadol, and needless to say I feel horrible. The physical WD's were horrible for about 3 days then it went away but the psychological WD's are killing me. I'm always hanging out with friends and smoking mad weed to distract myself but I always end up craving this wonderful feeling that is the warmth of Tramadol.

A research article on the drug Tianeptine. It states that the behavioral effects of the antidepressant requires the mu-opioid receptor.,"I have used tianeptine recreationally and was not prescribed it from a doctor, a version of it was sold as a “dietary supplement” in gas stations throughout the southeast. It had great antidepressant effects and I believe this was mostly due to the fact that it’s a full agonist at the mu-opioid receptor. Could this change the way we view opioids/opiates in the treatment of depression?
*Edit*: It does claim tianeptine does not lead to tolerance or withdrawal and I disagree with that statement because I have experienced the hellish withdrawals from continued use of this drug.

If you take to much just dulls the codeine high?

I still smoke marijuana daily, I still occasionally take bars and hallucinogens, but at least I’m not in that lifestyle anymore, and I thank God every day.

I'm a chronic pain patient who has been prescribed 5/325mg percocets for pain the last couple of months, starting in January. It was a relief, and even though they don't do much, it provided a nice window where I don't have to worry so much and it takes the edge off of the pain. I had a ten day gap between prescriptions in late February, so what's relevant is that I've been taking 5mg just about daily since then. Almost every day, sometimes twice, and occasionally a day or two in between without. Those days in between haven't been all that horrible, but the past few weeks to a month, the day after or even later in the day of that dose:

 \- intense pangs of dizziness and anxiety that last 0.5-5 seconds at the longest (the worst version of this happened when I came off kratom last year, it lasted a half hour and was debilitating)

 \- barely noticeable runny nose

 \- occasional muscle twitches/rarely the shakes

 \- scalp crawling

 \- irritability

It's not every day, and in fact most recently I went 2 days with basically no withdrawal symptoms at all. Maybe 3 pills over this past week after 5-6 most weeks, and that was the last of my prescription. I had my last pill about 29 hours ago, but last night and today have been rough for some reason. Lots of that dizziness, raised anxiety most of the day trying to distract myself from all this.

I know it's withdrawal, but I also know I'm taking the smallest amount my doc will even prescribe. I even asked a few appointments back about a lower dosage, but he said insurance companies don't even like to pay for anything lower than that. It's a specialty item. What can I expect? I know it's going to be an unpleasant few days before I see my doctor and whether or not I want another prescription or not is in the air, though my pain is fucking awful. Is this going to be as bad as I fear? Or am I blowing this out of proportion with my low dosage and relatively low frequency medical habit.",1555713211.0

I take 400mg of quetiapine at night for insomnia and bipolar. I've read that it can possibly lessen the WDs, but I'm not experiencing any symptoms at all.

Maybe this is something others can try out to see if it helps them with the WDs. Any feedback is appreciated.

as a disclaimer: im not bad mouthing the sub.
i know diferent people like different drugs wich is fine but just from my point of view as a heavy opiate user i cant help but be very amused by that sub because it reads like its the child or 
r/opiates if that makes any sense. one post on there i read today hit it om the head: there are only a few types of posts on here and they are: is my shit real/good, how much should i do/pay, look at the shit  i got and  how do i get it?
the reasons  i find it funny is that i look fondly on people asking about the dosage of codiene seeing as it has a bioavailability  threshold   way lower then what it would take to OD for just about anybody.  the  prices they pay also makes me laugh seeing as theyll  pay $800 for 1500mg of codiene  wich i could buy otc for $30 😂 i mean perspnally  at this point codeine  is completely  pointless for me to do due to my dilaudid tollerance , shit even oxy dosent do it for me anymore. but i have had a codiene script from the ages of 13- 18 and even then  i didn't find much recrrational  value to it, ive also gotten scripts for lean and its abundantly clear that  the  antihistamines (promethazine) is what makes you high since it potentiates  the codiene. i also find it funny how people  make fake lean and who can blame em since its so lucrative  but im really mind boggled  how this exorbitant value was established, but thats what really makes me laugh  that  people pay  **$1000** for the morphine miligram equivalent  to an oxy 40 😂 wich as im sure u all know its waay overpriced if it costs you even $40.  like ok the drug is the drug and its fine if people like it  but the dealers who set that price and the users who are willing to pay it is just too funny. like getting a script for lean is one  of  the easiest things to do i could get several every day if i wanted to even in this day and age.  i guess its the novelty factor. anyways like i said im not trying to talk shit about the sub its simply a forum for the lean community  but the community and market itself os just fuckin hilarious all around. so to r/lean i say :to each thier own it obviously dosent bother me if you  want to do lean instead of other opiates but  im willing to bet that most of you arent even aware that you dont get high off codiene, oxy , hydros  you get high off of what they are metabolized into in your body and its all...MORPHINE!!   yep however you take it and whatever opiate you buy ( with a couple exceptions) they all end up being the exact same thing in your body the only differnce is bioavailability,dosage  and price.  if you wanna do  try lean just go to the doc and say uve had a cough for 6 months and that ur allergic to those two ingredients  in ever otc cough syrup or even buy it one time but for your own sake  just try  buying  any another  prescription opiod  at least once ,dose accordingly, add some $5  otc antihistamine (bebadryl, prometh wtv)  and tell me that  it wasnt exaclty the same  or better for much much less.  


tldr: i find r/lean very funny because  i view it fondly as a sub of people  who are on thier way to us but ironically are spending waay waay more than we ever would on thier habbits  (about $1000 for a pint wich is the morphine  mg equivalent  of a  single $20-$40 40mg oxy) and have  pretty much the same product quality,dosage  etc. problems we do but  but are  only  as dire  as a  small  fraction of  the scale  of ours. o yeah did i mention how much  they spend 😂?",1555704580.0

In a web I saw that mepiridine or petidine cannot be mixed with methadone due a interaction, but i don't know more about it.

I'm on methadone since almost a month, started with 30mg per day and since 9 days ago the dr upped my dose to 40mg due tolerance, I had some withdrawal symptoms at the end on 30mg. Well, the last weekend I don't know how, but 2ml (10mg) lacked in my last dose of Sunday because the PMM is closed on weekends. I took 30mg instead 40mg due this on the morning, and on the nigh I was in an extreme generalized pain in all my body, was unbearable a fucking hell, I almost couldn't walk for the pain. I'm suffer of chronic pain since almost one decade (for that reason I started on opiates by medical prescription). Then I went to urgency of my private insurance, I told the situation to the dr and he said to the nurse that inject me 10mg of diazepam IM and 50mg mepiridine IV. I felt great almost instantaneous, without any kind of pain, really relaxed, seems like I was walked in the heaven between clouds. Never tried mepiridine before, because where I live just is comercialized for hospitable use, not for prescription in pills. And excluding tramadol a few years ago in urgencies too, was the unique strong opiate I tried IV, for medical reasons.

Well, that was on Sunday-Monday at midnight. On Monday I started with my usual dose of methadone everyday of 40mg, but on Wednesday at night I had an awful withdrawal symptoms, I took 6gr of kratom red vein borneo in less than half hour and I took diazepam 10mg but I was very fucked yet. Then I took one oxycodone 5mg IR I had in my stash, and in 20 minutes I felt great without any withdrawal symptom.  

Do you think this could happened for the interaction of mepiridine and methadone? Or maybe because 72h later after the 50mg of mepiridine injected I could entered in withdrawal? Or could be the tolerance of methadone that is rising and maybe I need an adjustment in the dose? 5mg more for example.

My fucking pill bottle (oxycodone, 15mg) was in my hand; he didn't even ASK for a pill count. I tried twice to get a word in and he would just cut me off and say, ""I'M JUST GONNA STOP YOU RIGHT THERE"".. Thus, I could never explain to him that I simply fell asleep early after work the day before and didn't take my evening pill.

He then gave me only half of my normal script.. so #42 pills for exactly 14 days and said I had to start coming in twice a month (so he can double his monthly co-pay from me at $40 a pop). He then said after the next two scripts, he would be taking me off the medication and putting me on medical marijuana instead.. and to bring $150 for the application. LO'fuckingL.. So anyway, fed up with the scrutiny, interrogations, false accusations and petty behavior.. I gave him the script back and mouthed, ""fuuuck yoooou"" and walked out.

Kratom is illegal here in my state (hence why I even ended up taking opioid medication for my chronic pain issues in the first place), so I went back to my GP who initially referred me to pain management. He was originally prescribing me #120, 10mg Hydrocodone, #90 Klonopin and #90 Gabapentin every month; without issue. I just felt that the hydro wasn't lasting long enough an was tired of popping pill after pill - so the plan was to hopefully be scripted oxycontin, dilaudid or some other type of ER medication.. but nope, this dickhead pain management doctor somehow figured that a 15mg oxy would cover pain for EIGHT HOURS. Sorry, I digress.. so I go back to my GP - who is a super legit physician that is compassionate, patient, understanding and doesn't judge you for being honest. I don't abuse my meds and I don't ask for more than I need, so he takes care of me. I explained the situation to him and BAM - he writes me four scripts; one for my blood pressure, cymbalta (new), #120, 10mg hydro and then without me even asking, increases my klonopin to .5mg, x3 day (was taking x2 day).

Sorry for the long, boring rant.. I just had to get it out and then share the obligatory ""refill"" photo; as I always enjoy seeing others pics when they score:) Hope everyone is comfortable and taken care of today.. and if not, best wishes on getting well soon. Peace and empathy to anyone hurting or in WD; you have my utmost sympathies from someone who back in the day abused everything from heroin, oxymorphone, fent, morphine, hydromorphone, etc. to the tune of approx $80k between 2012 and 2015.. it's been a long dark road. Happy nods to the soldiers and feel better soon to anyone just dealing with chronic pain - cheers

bf0fcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bf0fcg/oxy_withdrawals_sleep/,13,https://redd.it/bf0fcg,KnowTheConversation,Oxy Withdrawals & Sleep,"Hi y'all,

Stumbled on this forum while looking for WD advice. Figured I'd tell my story and hunt for some feedback. Skip towards the bottom if you don't want the context, just the question. 

I've been a casual recreational user of opiates for over 10 years now, and had always been under control, doing maybe 15-20 7.5mg hydros a month for the majority of that. No problems, withdrawal, cravings, whatever. 

Well flash back to two months ago, I'm with my weed guy, who has another guy at his place...convo turns to opiates, he whips out some of those oxy 30 blues with the M in the square, talkin' bout how fun they are. My normal rec dose was 22-25mg, so it didn't feel like a big bump up, I was flush with cash, so I thought 'fuck it, let's go on a little bender.' Something I've done before with the hydro, with no ill effects. So for a few weeks I was doing those blues once a day...then it became twice a day for a couple more weeks. After a month I figured I was done...but I began having early withdrawal sweats and anxieties, realized this was more of a problem than I realized, and resolved to self-detox when I could break away from my life/partner/work for a little while. Unfortunately, that opportunity didn't come for another month or so, and towards the last 10 days of that I was up to 3 30s a day because why not, right?

However, I'm a self-possessed guy so I didn't have a problem leaving town, booking a nice hotel in a big city, and just suffering through it. I'm 6 days' in now, and the worst of the acute withdrawal symptoms are fading, though at peak they were intensely hellish (I can't imagine what the heavier/longer-term users on here have to deal with, I have immense amounts of sympathy and respect for those of you that manage to get through that without using.)

My main problem at this point is sleep. I have slept 2, .5, 0, 1, & 1 hours the past 5 nights, I've tried CBD, tylenol pm, benadryl, nyquil pm, melatonin, st. john's wort, valerian root, showers, baths, fuckin' warm milk, asmr, ambient scandanavian music to focus on...nothing helps, I toss & turn all night and usually after going to bed around midnight and trying desperately to make it work, I'll get a wink before the sun comes up. I feel in my waking hours like I'm starting to become incoherent, and I've only got two nights left to fly solo before I have to head back to my partner...and I'd rather not tell them about all this, having gotten into it and working on getting out of it on my own...but there'd be no getting around it if I'm in this state when Sunday rolls around. 

So, given my timeline/dosage, do you guys have any advice on how long this insomnia is going to last, or anything I haven't tried that might help? Thanks for reading and I appreciate any advice.",1555687761.0

Having lived in America in the past, but lving in a very anti-drug and conservative country right now has made me abuse prescription drugs whenever I could.

So I found out that Tramadol is an opioid that gives you a opiate-like high and has been abusing tramadol for 2 months now. My tolerance is pretty high now needing at least 600mg to feel the effects. Due to my low supply, I googled ways to potentiate tramadol for days and finally was able to narrow it down to two methods : 1. Staggering the dose 2. Taking other potentiator drugs such as gabapentin, cimetidine, xanax, alcohol, weed, and etc.

As I mentioned before, I am in a very conservative country right now. Out of all the potentiators mentioned above, I only have a few mgs of xanax. (Alcohol too but I personally do not like to drink when I take trams)

After all the googling and studies, I found out that taking tagamet (cimetidine) some time after taking tramadol can potentiate the high.

Unfortunately, I am not able to get my hands on cimetidine but instead I have some ramitidine and was wondering if this will potentiate trams as well.

Also, would having some baking soda or tums (to make your stomach less acidic) potentiate tramadol the same way it potentiates opiates?? How about drinking tonic water some time after taking trams?

Would taking daily supplements such as multivitamins, fish oil, coq10, silymarin help??

These are the list of drugs I have: Xanax / naproxen / lexapro / aceclofenac / celecoxib / ranitidine / trazodone Would any of these help? I know xanax does but dk abour others..

Damn I am so frustrated how I have to find ways to potentiate tramadol in extremely limited ways.. Would appreciate some help here.",1555664344.0

Broken the big sub addiction, use long enough to pass the main wds. Then taper over 3 days: 8, 4, 2.

- already 18 to 14 for 48 hrs.
- negative 2mg more tomorrow. 12mg.
- continue dropping twos till I get to about 3 weeks away, and try to stabilize and deal with the rest 1 mg a month after that.

My new life and experience off opiates below,"Where do i start?  87 days ago I woke up to my lines of dope on my nightstand.. I hit em hard and called my boss to tell him I needed help... I was living in Chicago sniffing hella dope and popping 15 Klonopin on the plane on the way to rehab at 160 lbs and now I'm 185 lbs stupid healthy and living out west (from the east). I live in a 1.5 million dollar sober living house with plenty of space and comfort for 1200 a month (cheaper than my chicago spot)  I am great shape I workout 4 or 5 times a week and i go hiking every Sunday with a ""normy"" friend I met on bumble.  I also play basketball at the gym with my childhood friend who moved here last year. 

My experience....I don't have a car and it sucks to bum rides but it's whatever.  There is STUPID money out here lotta old money and a lotta new money self made and trust fund babies who took advantage of their situation.  I like talking to people about their buisnesses and getting to know the ropes.  Because of my situation I don't feel I am right for AA.  I soak up what I can at the meetings but I don't work the steps and I probably wont.  I wasn't a deadbeat I supported my addiction I didn't steal and I never oded.  Basically if its not the AA way its YOUR way but both might work and both might not.  I said at a meeting im doing it my way and that if you're hiking to the top of a mountain you don't have to take the hardest trail...the easier trail leads to the top too.  

A story worth noting
(I dont call this a relapse) 14 days ago I went out with my ""normy"" friend and i got drunk.  I was on my level hitting on every sexy girl I could and if they rejected me I didn't let it affect my mood it was just on to the next one...i had a black tee and Levi straus tight blue jeans I borrowed from my friend that weighs 60lbs more than me and old air maxes ... No buss down rolly no car no hurricane Harvey on my neck but this didn't stop me from approaching this bad bitch and making her mine for the night...ireland transplant dark features but blue eyes and one of the dopest asses ive seen yet...she had a heavy accent using words like cunt and wanker which turned me on bc it was different.. She was really down to earth and fun to hang out with ...we left the bar together and I brought her to the hookah bar next door..? By 3 am I was sipping henny with her, her hand laid up on my leg and me making drunk jokes to her saying freaky shit like you can sit on my face when we get back to your crib (turned out it wasn't a joke) ...as I spit my game ego on astronomical levels, these herbs across the hookah bar from me watch closely with their 1000 dollar louie and gucci outfits that they ran up a check on, which made me feel even more like the man .... To cap the story off She said ""you better fuck me good if I take you to my place""... Of course I said ""say no more!""  Off to her crib not far away and it was OVER. I accomplished my goal for the night.  

Needless to say this was a MAJOR ego boost and if you read this far you can tell I still like my vices 😆..i love hitting on women I'm probably a sex addict and I like filling voids..(I also rented an exotic car for a few days the week before that) ...but this doesnt mean I have to sniff dope and do other drugs people!  I think it's prudent to also say that I feel like I'm learning to love myself now ... Like I really feel like I'm never touching drugs again .... I even smell weed (its everywhere out here) and I'm not phased ... I'm a little bit upset with myself for drinking just over pussy but hey I still feel great and I don't regret it... I moved on from that awesome night..pleasure is temporate (as well as pain)  I have my good days and my bad days but i get through them without substances thats what is most important...i should also note that they dont test for alcohol so I know I could get away with it again and I  had many more opportunities to drink and chose not too... Rather than drink a bloody Mary that Sunday I ran off the hangover playing basketball at the gym .... ONLY reason I felt any guilt at all was bc of the setting i live in at the moment...

To close with positivity for all opiate addicts out there
we can all get through this... We are all smart and creative people.  We just have to channel our energy in the positive direction not the negative one.  Don't run from your emotions, recognize them, contantly be mindful and check yourself as quickly as possible..bring yourself back to humility... BE PATIENT it will not come to fruition overnight... not all of you may be able to pull this off getting drunk once in a while but no one knows you like yourself don't let anyone tell you differently...I literally feel like I got it out of my system ... I can seem sociopathic at times but best believe I am aware of it... I like my character defects I don't want to be some even keeled boring guy.. and I havent even felt like drinking since... You won't ever catch me drinking alone if I ever have a drink in the future it will only be to enhance my social event ...Best believe i still count my clean time...alcohol is not the same thing as dope idc how you slice it ...you still need self control but opiates are another animal people....I really feel like I'm a new man ... I live in a new city and the health and business vibes out here are on another level... I've never felt so inspired to be the man in my life ... I'm going to take a real estate course this summer and continue to grow ... Be perrenial learners people... Put in the work to grow and sustain the growth ....accept change and most importantly love yourself... We fucked up but everyone fucks up we are human and far from perfect but we can strive to be better....own your addiction ... Know which lines You crossed that You can't come back from...You are not powerless .. Shit if I was powerless I would not have gotten this far ... Anyway that's all I got",1555656898.0

Its about the treatment I got in a research study for monthly Bupe injections. Im pretty sure it was 2015 when I decided I wanted to get clean and found out about this study. It was being done at a nonprofit drug clinic close to me. After my initial acceptance into the program I had to prove I was addicted by showing up with withdrawls. Then sign all the papers for it,  which included stipulations like i cannot drink grapefruit juice, and I have to use birth control when having sex (condoms,etc) because they dont know what the affects could be during pregnancy. 

So I got in. They paid me with gift cards each appt I had. I constantly had UAs,  blood taken, a machine with the nodes hooked to my chest reading whatever it was reading idk.  And ofcourse I had monthly bupe injections, that slowly released over that 30 days. They had 2 strengths available and let me choose,  I always chose the stronger one. The injections would be given into my lower stomach area, in 4 places that rotated. It actually hurt pretty good when they put that needle in me and slowly pushed the bupe dose in, burned like hell. 
Not that this was a bad experience. I got clean, got paid to do it, and didnt have to do any of that group stuff or NA. We did have a counselor assigned that I would see one on one once a week. But thats it. I actually had a lot of fun coming in, all the ladies there were really nice and chill. 

Anyway. I did that for 18 months. It was suppose to be a year study, then got extended. The shots work very well and theres no going back, couldn't have got high if I tried. I know the plan is for this to be on the market soon. So I wanted to throw it out there that there is someone here that has done it and I can try and answer any questions anyone might have about it. One thing though, it lingered in my body longer than it was suppose to. It has its own natural taper because of the way it works, which is nice. But I really wanted to test my tolerance after being clean for about 20 months and could not get high at all. Took an extra 3 to 4 months longer than expected to finally wear off. So heads up on that. 

I actually was in to see them today for my very last visit. Several years later. They have been checking to see if there are any amounts of bupe left in my system still. Some of the others have had trouble passing UAs for work or drug court because of how long this shit stays inside the body. There are still trace amounts that are inactive they said. Like .04 micrograms in me or something. I was told I had a lower amount than the others that were in the study. 

Well thats my story in a nutshell, Im sure I left some stuff out, but whatever. If you read it all than thanks for your time. Im down to answer any questions.",1555656058.0

Doc switched my gout prevention drug and gave me 21  tabs of 10-325 Percocet which is my DOC. But even more rewarding...I come home and my wife told my mother in law about my pain recently and gave her a bottle of 20 5-325 (the 512s which I like). As a result...,

1. I’m in very little pain at the moment
2. I’m high AF
3. I spent the last 2 hours talking about baseball with my 7 year old while not In pain....which was a spiritual experience in its self.

But....

I’m at cross roads, I have legitimate chronic pain and Oxy works and truthfully I love the high so much, with that being said....I think it’s a blessing and the world working correctly that I can’t get a long term script. I have gotten constant small scripts over the last 6 months (10 pills here, 20 there) the ortho practice i go to has the PAs, whoever is working call in the scripts so my PMP looks like I am doctor shopping. Truth is, if given a monthly script, I would  abuse and become physically dependent (which has never been the case). I never actually admit it out-loud but I definitely have the addiction gene. My dad is in pain management but it’s really just a doc giving him 120 Oxy 10 per month, he has since 2006. Dad is fucked up all the time. My uncle died of a codeine overdose. Seriously, he took a shit load and died. My grandmother’s trifecta was wine, Valium and bathtubs for hours at a time. My grandfather walked around the house with a cup of Wild Turkey neat.

Just a little backstory, my fiancee and I were full blown pill heads about 3 years ago and got into contact with an older couple (mid 50s maybe) who were slinging Roxy 10's, 15's and OP 80's. They lived in the worst trailer park wed ever seen on the outskirts of Gary Indiana. This area still felt semi safe to us as it was still on the edge of an affluent area. We quickly gained the trust of this couple and we had a GREAT relationship. I knew I could count on them to be good when they said and I could roll by their trailer and grab my stuff and dip out in mere minutes. The wife was always outgoing and asked about us and our relationship and took a genuine liking to us. It made us sad when we quickly noticed the signs of crack abuse and literally watched them deteriorate in the 2 years we worked together. 

Don't get me wrong this couple were straight crackheads and we had our ups and downs. Sold bunk E to us, left us hanging a few times and got into shouting matches with the husband but overall we knew they were very caring, took time to take care of us when we were sick and fronted us in desperate times. They knew we were dumb kids from the suburbs but never took advantage of us. We knew they had an extremely tumultuous relationship (she often sold us pills she stole from her own husband) but we also knew they cared about each other genuinely. 

We eventually had to cut ties when we knew we had a real problem. Besides the random offer for a stove or microwave we hadnt heard from them in awhile. We recently went to find out how they were doing recently only to be shocked by the fact that they had both been murdered in Gary IN. We were both speechless for the rest of the night because we had formed a pretty tight relationship with these people. One of them were literally left in a ditch like an empty pack of smokes. We think the wife got killed and the husband and his bro went for revenge and got in over their heads. We still don't know how to process the whole thing but are just glad we got out when we did.

The whole thing has just been a sobering reminder of how fucked the game really is. This couple literally could have been the people you know from down the street who love to see you in slightly different circumstances. The game don't give a fuck. They probably owed a dealer a few bucks and disposed of them like trash. 

Don't mean to bring y'all down but were just really sad about this and feel that no person deserves this shit and its so sad that our system pushes aside otherwise decent people like this. Please stay safe out there and hug your loved ones whenever you can.

Maybe he only got it for her cuz he knew her, idk man.. but he didn't come back, then I had to fucking leave so I got burned for 40. Who knows, maybe he did come out, but regardless, I know his name now and what he looks like and he's smaller than me so I'm definitely gonna be paying a visit back there, the last 2 times i've been there he's been just standing outside so i'm pretty sure he lives there.

Previously i started with a small amount and kept smoking til i was high enough, so i dont really know the proper dosage to do this.

I dont have any tolerance to opioids rn but i am experienced with them. Just not with H since its not really around in my homecountry.

Is 70mg a good dose to start with?

Boy was that a mistake, i’ve never been so vilified in all my life. I love that sub there are some wonderful people on there who have helped me produce some beautiful buds, which caused another argument because I sell a lot of my weed as its never going to be decriminalised in the UK anytime soon. That was a big nono as well! People need there green man one way or the other, better your friendly neighbourhood dealer than some Afghanistan Farm or a Cartel. So that tripped me up a bit as well, but mainly just the fact that people who use drugs themselves were not open to the fact that a consenting adult should be allowed to put whatever they want in there body, so long as they’re hurting/effecting anyone else, which i’m not. I would have loved to have discussed (to them it was an argument) with maybe 2 people at the most but i was fighting a battle on several fronts and as soon as i closed one point another was opened so eventually I just deleted the post. Shame, it seems we are.. and will always be labelled nothing more than junkies.. all because you like opiates haha. I’m not fussed I just thought earlier at work i’d like to tell you guys.

It might help to put a but about my back ground, i’m 24 UK earn a very good wage at quite a prestigious company who fortunately don’t partake in RDTs (although i’ve heard though the grapevine they’re trying to push it through but the union isnt having it). I have a beautiful GF who is aware and has no qualms with my drug use, some times partakes herself (not opiates, I won’t let her just incase she goes down the addiction road) and own an A Class A200, my life atm is perfect and i really am just a recreational user! Haha so hard to make that sound convincing! 

But i do know that a lot of people on here are addicted and don’t want to be and are living much harder lives than me so i’m really not trying to shit on anyone here coz i love you guys same as I do on MG, i just thought i’d offer a little background.

For about 9 days ive been on a H binge. That being said im quitting but I know even minor withdrawals from a binge canbe a bitch. Luckily i have plenty of kratom,which I hate, anyway i just planned on using it for the 2 days im waiting for etizolam to come in which will make withdrawals simple. 

However i did a shot this morning and decided i would take 5-6 grams of kratom so that i could save my last shot for a goodnight sleep. That was about 2 hours ago. Suddenly im sitting in my games chair playing overwatch and i get a wave of EXTREME anxiety and i break out it an ungodly sweat. It was the closest thing ive ever experienced to precipitated withdrawals. 

Anybody else ever experience this or something similar? Tbh it lasted maybe 5 minutes and now im just hungry af and feel fine. A little jittery but thats super common with kratom for me.",1555620043.0

He introduced me to Reddit and this page. He has truly opened my mind and heart to addicts. My brother is also an addict. Addiction surrounds me. I promise you though, I'm not empty or lost. 
I would like to say I don't really like to call my brother or my boyfriend addicts.  I understand that have an addiction, but I see them as people before I see them as an addict. I find that to be important. Labeling is a powerful thing in my opinion. I feel as a society we minimize people's worth by labeling people as an addict. If we're going to do that, can we leave the label as objective, without such negative connotation. 
Addicts are not bad people. Some have done morally questionable things, but they're not bad people. Family take their act of addiction and use personally, it's not personal. Everyone is just trying to cope, trying to feel normal I guess. What is normal? Life's a mess. Maybe society should change their view and understand a day in the life of your shoes, then they could begin to understand why you do what you do. My boyfriend loved getting high too. He still does. But he doesn't like being alone on the comedowns..he doesn't life the inevitable withdrawals, and he doesn't like working his ass off to have nothing to show for it. He wants to see a different side of life.

""This is a little counterintuitive, given that cold showers also stimulate noradrenaline, which can feel like panic. The answer appears to be that cold showers also increase levels of beta-endorphin, which binds to opioid receptors the same way as opioid drugs. Beta-endorphin reduces bodily stress and promotes homeostasis, which involves pain management, behavioural stability, and reward.

Mentally, physically and financially.","I know everyone’s different and this maybe personal and if not allowed plz let me know. I’m new. Just wondering how everyone feels about their current situation. 
I like learning and hearing About how people got to where they are and where they plan to go in life.  Like my buddy is a veteran and struggles really bad with pain, ptsd and anxiety.  He is very under treated and under prescribed at the va. He has neck and back injuries and knee injuries from combat. All they give him is tramadol twice a day 50mg and that usually isn’t enough for him. I worry about him all the time because he has to resort to street pharma some times and I feel like it’s a double edge sword. Yes it’s good to have access to pain meds to keep you out of pain but it’s costing money and also it could be dangerous maybe if there pressed. 

I know many of my other friends I’ve met it affects their anxiety and daily life having to worry about having enough meds and not get sick or be in pain.  How does one cope with that? Does that lead to anyone struggling with depression or anxiety or ability to work? I struggled with being under prescribed myself for a long time and it took a toll on my body. My mind. And my life. I’m still technically not prescribed what I should be in most people’s eyes with all my conditions and injuries but it’s better than it was. At least I don’t have to go the street pharma route. 

Does anyone have a story they’d like to share. 

I would like to encourage anyone struggling with pain who is under prescribed. Don’t give up. Plz. Never give up. If you ever feel like your done and you wana give up. There’s people on reddit and drs who do care. I will even be here for someone if you need a shoulder to cry on on someone to just vent out to. I’m a very good listener and I have a ton of advice usually people say they appreciate. I try to stay positive and helpful and hopeful. I had to deal with a very rude dr for a long time who made me feel terrible about being on opiates and made me feel a way I can’t explain.  And then I read some reddit post about talking to a diff dr and how to talk to them and I found a ton of things that helped me communicate better and open up more dialogue. Honestly changing drs and speaking exactly how it is and not being dramatic and not over using words helped me relay to my dr how bad I really was struggling. 
I also keep a pain journal. I am very fascinated with opiates and thing they are an amazing thing and should be both respected and loved at the same time. They can help and they can hurt. You gotta have respect. Just some feels I have right now. I hope everyone’s having a good weekend and drop a line or something here and tell me how it is for you or your view on things. I know there is a vast array of opiate fans and opiate haters and people who have to do them or just enjoy take them people who just only use for pain. What do opiates mean to you and what does the current situation do for you.  Has the “opiate epidemic” affective you? Even my dr told me most of the opiate crisis is because drs are cutting people off, under prescribing or other things but the major issue isn’t opiates. It’s the cutting of street meds. And many drs are staring to really see that and realize hey if we just treat people like they should and not punish them for being on opiates maybe we can decrease their chances for really abusing. There’s fine line between it. And I know many friends teeter between it and I don’t judge anyone for anything because everyone has a story and a reason.

Today I'm 579 days ""sober"" after I started suboxone treatment. I don't consider myself completely sober, as I am still dependant on suboxone.

Two days before I started, I made a post here on my account (which I can't use anymore due to it being too much of a reminder). When I made the post saying I was done, that I'm tired of being sick and only using to avoid WD's and not because I enjoy it, I got the typical ""see you soon"" or ""you'll be back"" posts, but I also got a lot of support.

I asked what I could expect, I told you guys that I was scared,  and most of you believed in me. You called me down and reassured me. You helped me. And at the time, you had much more faith in me than I did.

I wanted to thank you and this community for helping me through the worst part of my life when I was using, and also when I was recovering. Your words, whether you meant it or not, really saved me, as I didn't want to live like that anymore.

I want you to know that no matter how far gone you are, or how badly you think it's too late, or how you don't believe you could ever actually quit... you can. It is never too late to quit. Ever. If you've even considered quitting, it means that your brain is already on the path of quitting. I honestly believe that if I can do it, so can you.

Sure, you will still have to live with the reason why you started in the first place, whether it's trauma, depression and anxiety, or mental illness or... Well, anything, you can get help for that. I started using because I was suicidal and I knew this would help. And it did. For years and years, it put a bandaid on, and I never killed myself, suicidal thoughts weren't as prevalent... but they came back when I quit. Now I'm seeing a therapist on antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication, and I might be for a long time. But it's miles better than what it was before.

To sum up, thank you for believing in me when I didn't. It's never too late. You're not too far gone. You're not too old. You're not so damaged.  You can quit if you want to. But you **do** have to want to quit. Thank you what you've done for me. I believe in you. If you have any questions, or just wanna talk, I'm always free to help a friend.",1555584404.0

I know the fent tests are a must have, but I think the test kit will also be a good thing to have around just because. So I guess the question I’m asking is, does anyone have any experience with it or perhaps any other test kits that are able to test for oxycodone and are also well known and do indeed do what they’re supposed to do. 

Also, is there somewhere else online that is cheaper than $2 each for good, real fent testing strips. I know you can’t put a price on saving your own life, but I’d really like it if I could get more than 10 for $20 considering that’ll be used in like three days of using. 

Lastly, I know it’s possible to get anaphylaxis from heroin and morphine. When I’ve shot morphine, I’d get “hives” around the area for a few minutes.

I could keep on the way I am, or I can try something different for a while and see where that gets me.

I wish everyone going thru it, getting away from it and staying away from the very best and much love. You've all heard it, but if I can then you can too.

And to those thinking about it, thinking you can just live the life every now and and then, it's all in the blink of an eye the things you'll go thru and where your life ends up. Maybe it's worth the second thought. Gut instinct is a motherfucker.

So for the sake of discussion here, lets presume that the drug in solution has been processed with a micron filter, and reasonable clean technique is used throughout this process, including actually administering the dose IM.

The question then is this: Can you administer a dose IM with an insulin rig? I have missed shots before, and most certainly these doses are more subQ than IM, and I generally don't seem to get much that way as far as onset of drug effects.

Lets say the largest size is being used, 1/2 inch needle, is it reasonable to try to reach muscle tissue with 1/2 inch needle? Obviously some areas of the body the muscle is closer to the skin.

I would love some advice, both from professional medical folks, or people who have direct experience. My reasoning and intuition tell me there's no reason why the muscle tissue couldn't be reached (with maybe a little downward pressure to help ensure entry to muscle tissue),  however obviously it is not the right tool for the job, definitely not as long as it should be.

Today I copped 5gs of some super fire #3 H. I also got 100x 2mg Xanax bars originaly sealed. They arent fake and only costed me 30$. Great deal. Love the UK because of  their super cheap Xanax. Never got them in a bottle before. Only got blisters. Man how I missed being high from H. Last week I ODed of some Fent analogue because that was all I could find. In my now 4 years of addiction I never ODed before since we dont got an opioid epidemic the prices for Heroin are more than great and even the street dope isnt cut with fent. So I got the fent from the onions and the vendor told me its super strong and that I really should only consume mg's of it. It was the second day I used it and it even had some real legs. But I wanted to nod and snorted about maybe 10-15mg and I still remember snorting it, pack away all my consume stuff and laid down to wait for it to kick in and being high as a kite. Then the next thing I know is waking up in the ambulance car, my ears had such a strong bellringer. That was more than crazy. I screamed super loud while talking to the guys in the car and they also screamed cause I didnt can hear them. I am so glad that I am still alive. So today I popped 2 Xanax and snorted about .3 of H amd I am feeling more than great. Also I know that after I ran out of dope I got the Xanax to help me through wds. Thats a great thing cause I know that the 5g are gone in latest a week. But this week I dont have to stress myself about dating, not sleeping and all the other stuff you have to worry and stress about while being clean.

I went through a breakup a couple months ago and started using dilaudid heavily and doing it every day while still taking my suboxone.

Last week I had an appointment and I was completely honest with my dr about it (he’s a good guy and I’ve had to do work at his house through my job so he kind of knows me a bit better than some patients) and I expected I’d lose my take homes as per what usually would happen. 

I told him what happened and that by taking my suboxone at 7am, I can usually shoot up around 7pm and catch a fairly good buzz if I do enough, so I wanted to go on a higher dose. 

He cut my takes homes down from once every 2 weeks to 2 times a week. Gives me a higher dose. So now I have to go on saturdays and also on Wednesday. With my job, I’m not able to go until after 5pm, I normally take my dose in the morning at 7am. 

Now I’m in an even worse spot cause on Wednesday, it’s gonna be over 30 hours since my last dose, so I know the highs gonna be even better. It kind of makes no sense to me since he knows what my job entails and that I work until 5 everyday.

I have never tried alcohol with it and I have cider 4% alcohol (it's like beer but sweet).

I'm scared shitless of dying and want to do this sensibly. Can I sip on cider slowly every 20min 1 sip and see how I feel or is there a chance of instant death? I'm very cautious and nervous about these things and want some advice.

Is there such thing as instant death with this?

As he has recently sold his house and as far as I know arrangements were made to so that he could pay of other debts and get a multi-thousand dollar chunk of money. Thus, I should be able to get my money now.



Of course I didn't expect him to simply call or text, ""hey buddy, I got the money.. hit me up so I can proactively pay you back!"" I'm reluctant to initiate contact or to be receptive because he might ask for a favor that I have to awkwardly refuse. If he needed to sleep over because he's waiting for his new apartment or something.... I could get bed bugs. If I turn that down, I'm arguably a bad person.... he would say yes to letting me sleep over his house if I was out on the street, so why not the other way? Well I guess, I'm not a risk for him in terms of bed bugs... it's a one-way risk factor or unidirectional.



&nbsp;


He has shared a number of stories about his charitable exploits. Such as when a beggar asked for money and he took the guy inside the store to buy the guy some food. Unlike his alleged recent run-ins with women, the aforementioned charitable acts are believable. Also, he really likes the Avengers movies. I am courteous when he talks about it/them because I've been given many an opportunity to mention Star Trek, so I'm not gonna be a dick and be like ""these movies aren't that good"" or something. I'm actually pretty neutral but I liked Iron Man a lot. 




More importantly, last time he kindly invited me and covered the cost of a movie ticket for the last Avengers movie, he offered me fucking oxy and/or dope multiple times. He wans't forceful about it, but for a recovering junky like myself.... any offer is arguable forceful. He's doesn't know that I'm still on subs, and I'm that is a factor as to why his offers are not terribly tempting.


What if I wasn't as motivated in my recovery as I currently am. What if I was not on subs and the aforementioned lack of motivation was the case? If I wasn't on subs, would I be more likely to say ""fuck it, for old time's sake""?



Then there was that time a month or so ago when I had him over in my backyard while I did some astronomy. He was telling me about his plans when he was like ""when I move out, I plan to have a little get together.. to party. Would you be down for that?""

My answer being, sure... but then an apparent misinterpretation of his words was realized by both of us. A duality to his meaning of ""party"", in that he also meant ""party favors"" in the sense of heroine and/or oxy. This I am obviously not down for, but it wasn't obvious to him despite my many ""no, thank you"" type responses. 

Maybe that's the problem, that I don't fucking snap and make it crystal clear that I'm good. Maybe he's just an asshole. 

He went on to softly insist and was like ""it's on me... you know like you don't have to buy any.."" Oh joy, and I already had said that I've accrued so much clean-time that I wouldn't want to break my clean streak. Does he truly not understand how important that is to me or he just trying to influence me back down that road? Anyway, he was like.. ""would you at least come hang out and drink if I got a bottle of Vodka?"" 

I like vodka and cranberry but I think this is part of his grand plan. Maybe I'm getting to conspiratorial, but I believe this kind offering of vodka isn't simply so that we can have a fun party. Nosiree, I think he wants to get me drunk enough to reduce my inhibitions... to drop my shields... to stop caring so much about my clean time.


To simply say ""when in Rome, break out the dope!"" Surely he would settle for, ""ugh, fuck it... chop up the line.."" OH wait, I wouldn't have to say that.. the line would already be out and ready for me before I got to the bottom of my third cup. At least, I would bet on that.

 
Point being, this is one of the reasons I'm not quick to reach out to him or respond. **Why I haven't reached out and simply asked, ""do you have my $50?**


&nbsp;

**Basically, the reasons for me are:**


* He'll offer me drugs.


* He'll say ""the money is held up in [escroll/insert reason here] and I only get [insert smaller amount of money here which is only enough to cover basiscs + his own drugs + any drugs he intends on offering me despite my refusals to partake]


* He'll make some kind of request that will make me wish I was not having a conversation with him so that he wouldn't have been able to make said request in person.


&nbsp;


**Scenarios** - if I were to contact Cliff:


I nominate the second bullet point from right above, that he would not have m $50 for some stupid reason. Real or not, it would at least serve to explain why he hadn't proactively messaged ""I got your $50 ready and waiting for you.""


That if I'm not hanging out with him, it's impossible for him to offer me opiates and impossible for him to get me to go down that road. I consider my sobriety to be as important to me as it is to others. Even if it isn't that important to others, I want to be beacon of hope and strength of will. Something others can look to in their time of temptation. Another reason for others to pick themselves up and brush the dust off in order to resume their recovery. There are too many heavy handed, judgemental Nazis in recovery communities... or those with an ""all or nothing"" attitude who care not to acknowledge anything less as being good. Well, that's what I've heard and interpreted, I have not interacted with those types very much and when I have I usually don't enlighten them to my status. If they're happy with where they are at, I congratulate them if the topic of their recovery comes up.


So anyway, as I said.. don't wanna communicate because then he'll try to get me to hang out. If I hang out, he'll use that as a vector to offer me opiates. Sloan using short-acting opiates is not an option because failure is not an option. Deviation from my personal program is highly discouraged. I don't want to say it's not an option (although it isn't for me) because I want others to know that if they do deviate... their recovery is not over. They just gotta get back on the horse even if it hurts a bit. That if they put up with that momentary discomfort, I'll be cheering them on and will put my hand out to pull them above the field of despair.


If Cliff was getting clean, maybe me not interacting with him would be negative on his psyche. However, it's more likely anything I do to help him will simply support his ability to carry out operations as an addict in active addiction. 


Maybe he really did scale back his use, I coldn't tell because I barely hang out with him but I am well aware of his ability to tell tall tales.


&nbsp;


**tl;dr:**


Is it worth $50 for me to re-initiate communication with Cliff. This could be as simple as texting, ""can I get my $50?""


Is it worth letting him keep the $50 in order to avoid contact. If or when he does hit me up, he'll probably be inviting me to a movie or asking for a favor. If he rings my doorbell at a time I can't avoid, then I might regret not getting my money back while there was a chance? Then again, maybe he has an excuse that would prevent me from getting my money now anyway.",1555515275.0

So I think I am a low level user. I mostly hit the codeine and I have binge stints of taking anywhere from 60mg to 150mg daily.  Been doing this on and off for three years. I have never exceeded 210-240mg a day (and I was only using that much daily briefly). My regular dose is 120mg.

However since having a long break of around a month I can no longer take any more than 90mg without feeling sick.

I just finished a 60mg a day stint (stints last around 7 weeks), and have had a week or so with nothing. Also 60mg is such a small amount so it shouldnt ruin my tolerance that much right? But when I take 90mg+ or more it makes me feel so seedy! WHich is bizarre considering I could take up to 200mg + in the past

Just took 7.5 Oxy and it just doesn't get me high in a nice way either anymore. I just feel spacy and nauseous.  I dont even want to take more than this as I feel it will just make me even more sick. This never used to happen :(

Even after longer breaks its just like my body cant handle them anymore or do I just need to have a much longer break? Surely this is abnormal though. People abuse opioids at much higher levels for longer than I do.

Love to all of you. Be safe everyone. Wish me luck. Not only do I need to do this but I want to, and that ‘want’ is for the first time. And I think because of that ‘want’ is what will make it a possible, reachable goal. 

Thanks to all of you who have been supportive in the past, and again, everyone please be safe and have a good one. 
I’m sure I’ll be on these forums again but it’s probably best if I stay away from looking at dope porn while going through the worst WD I’ll ever experience lol. 

Cheers friends.

So if youbget grossed out by shit, please don't keep reading.... I am doing this to genuinely help people. I dont wanna see comments ""Oh thats fuckin gross man"" ....you chose to read it. NOTE: THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANNA TREAT IT NATURALLY

So I've found some hacks for myself that may help you guys as well. I know how stressful it can be. I take Subutex everyday and I feel like it can be worse than dope or oxy as far as OIC goes. It's not all the time, but when it happens it sucks. So here's how I fix it.

1) Get a full nights sleep. This will not work if you dont get enough sleep.

2) Whatever you eat before that full nights sleep, make sure its rich in fiber. I get a nice big salad, with spring mix, spinach leaves, red onion, broccoli, some bacon and egg.
I also eat a wheat roll with butter.

3) Drink A couple glasses of water before you goto sleep, and when you wake up. Water is natures laxative, the opiates dry you up. 

4) When you wake up, after drinking a glass of water... Drink something with enough caffeine in it. I prefer Monster Lo Carb. Most people know what I'm talking about with coffee, coffee will make you shit. 

5) If you clash the sides of your hands together, and then cross arms and tap your elbows (funny bone) switching about every ten reps....this will natrually help your bowels move. Do this for about a minute or two and you'll be surprised how much it will help.

6) Also. If after that your still struggling, smoke a bowl of a weed. For some reason when I smoke , when it starts hitting me it will raise my heartbeat. Probably because it raises metabolism. 

7) Dont sit on the toilet, just squat over it. It will slide out so much easier.

8) Wait till after to dose your opiate.



Just so you know, if you haven't went for 3-4 days, your stool might be in chunks and hard, and it might hurt, but you have to get it out. What I do is just close my eyes and tell myself DO IT!! 

Again I'm just trying to help, the main key is honestly water and staying hydrated.",1555459650.0

I personally need at LEAST 30g or 29g. They used to have quite the variety. Now it's all one brand, kind of shitty lasting 31g rigs.

I'm considering going to Walgreen's or Fry's (Kroger) pharms to try & get the size rigs I want.

 I've tried CVS in the past and idk if it was the pharma cashier but she gave me the 21 questions bullshit, which I all had answers for. I look clean cut, I rarely IV so no track marks. 

I'm just broke af from medical bills, cerebral palsy specialist & 3 surgeries on my legs (2 major on my legs & ankle 1 minor on my lower leg). I'm in a lot of pain from that, even though I had the thigh high nutsack scraping casts taken off, I still have the below knees casts on. 

I'd order online (what site is the best, allegro?) but cant afford it atm with the shipping & I really dont need a box of 100.

Idk this started as a post about Walmart's new BS rigs but I'm wondering if any kind souls on this sub would mail me a bag or even a few sterile 1cc/1mL 29g or 30g ""long"" needle (12.7mm/ 1/2"") rigs

It’s all a bunch of crap.  Even some drs will admit that it’a a joke and a news/political/money thing and they don’t need to get in the way of letting drs ex and treat patients. The problem is when China got involved and shipping mass loads of fent and carfent and there was a ton of pressed pills and cut stuff and people are dying that way. If they just decriminalized opiates and cannabis and natural things like Kratom many people would be a lot safer and lives would be saved.  The act of having to rely on street pharma is what really makes it more dangerous. If we could just get access to safe meds when we need them we wouldn’t have the risk. There’s actually someone who is running in 2020 who said that’s what he wants to do is decriminalize stuff. So I dunno much about him other than what all he said on the joe rogan podcast on YouTube and the news article I read the other day but he sounds like a smart guy with plans.

So its been a longg ass time since my last post. But I was bored and decided to share this simple little trick (that Dboys DONT want you to know!!!) that ive been using to conserve my H lately. Ready?

Smoke with your scale on. Thats it. Sounds stupid simple right?

If you’re at home, and you have a scale, place it on your desk/table/whatever surface that you have your dope and foil on. Turn it on and place your dope on it. Now, every time you pick up your tar and break off a piece, place the rest back on the scale. That way you see exactly how much you’re actually smoking. I know I’m personally prone to just chain-smoking until all my shit is gone, not really realizing how much I’m actually using/wasting in a given smoke sesh. Its way too easy to just keep breaking off small pieces and throwing them on the foil until suddenly all your dope is gone and you’re fucked until the next day when you can re-up.

Leaving the scale on while you smoke forces you to consider how fast you’re going through your stash, and encourages you to conserve what you have. Its especially helpful for those who (like me) can compulsively smoke through all their dope in a single evening if they’re not careful.

So yeah, I hope this helps a few smokers out there get a little more mileage out of their dope. Also, if you don’t already, use a tooter and collect your resin! You’re missing out on some good returns if you don’t.

Anyway yeah, thats all guys. Happy nods and stay safe errybody",1555408263.0

Now over six months later, it starts leaking the same gross liquid and blood as well now. But the more i squeeze out, the smaller the hard part under my skin gets. Like it never entered my system.

Nice little personal stash I picked up today. My habits so out of hand right now that ive been having to pick up every two days at the very least, no matter how much I get! Nice feeling knowing ive got some time now without having to worry about hustlong money, going to cop or being sick. Easy pick up and cheap too! The bag came straight from the piso (actually been meaning to ask yall this for awhile now but do you know/use that slang? Pronounced pie-zo and means a mexican runner for the cartel. Think piso>plug>dealer>middle.Everyone uses that up where I am in the pnw dunno how common it is or even how to spell it or what it actually means....) Miticulously Wrapped in about half a roll of cling wrap which appeared to be dipped in soap every couple layers to keep it from smelling. It was even a gram and a half extra than the Mexican ounces (24gs) we've grown to expect up here so I was able to kick down my buddy who helped me get it nice n fat. Plus I was able to do all this while still having a 3pc left from my last pick up (which is why its 27) so I wasnt even sock while waiting to cop which NEVER happens. Felt so good. Anyway hope some of y'all had a good day as well and are catching a well deserved nod and maybe even a couple days off from your junkie hustle! Much love!",1555399681.0

The swelling was very minor, it went down about an hour or so after the missed shot. Today I was going to shoot in my left arm at the crook like normal. I didn’t register when i stuck the needle in so i pulled out without injecting any of the shot and a small pea sized knot formed at the hole afterwards. I pulled the tourniquet off and after a few minutes the knot went away but the area is bruised slightly and sore when i bend my arm. I wanted to know if there was anything I should do to speed up the healing process, and if there was anything i should avoid doing like not using that same vein until it heals completely.

Is there anything i should be worried about? Im a bit paranoid that there may be something wrong, but then again there are no bumps or knots and its just sore.

sometimes that can lead back down the dark path, but most times I think we can deal with the maintenance programs many of us have started on... the maintenance program i started on with subs, then m-done, then finally to Kadian has 100% saved my life since I started it about a year and a bit ago, that was literally the turning point when I stopped using fentanyl and crack, and stopped being majorly depressed and on the border of suicidal thoughts/tendencies.

Anyway here are those tips I wanted share for ANYONE who's thinking about or wanting to relapse.. or just wanting get that itch scratched temporarily because we all know it's a thirst that will never be quenched, and it's a mental disorder that will never go away, something we may most likely be fighting for the rest of our lives.

1. If you don't have any good friends you can link up with that you trust to make sure you're ok or that you trust enough to make sure you don't die in the event of an OD or some event where you're unconscious, make sure to use in a public park, or the washroom of a busy fast food restaurant or diner, that way if you OD there will be a much better chance of someone finding you and calling for paramedics, or if you're in my part of the world someone would just have naloxone on hand and be able to save you right then and there.
2. If you're in an area where Narcan has been made available OTC/non-prescription always make sure you have a stock of narcan, where I am they give out 0.4mg ampoules for free at every health center.. it usually takes 2 maaybe 3 on average of those ampoules to bring someone back, from what i've seen.
3. VERY IMPORTANT. Make sure you are NOT SITTING IN ANY AWKWARD POSITIONS. Preferrably laid flat on a bed or in a comfortable chair of some sort... This is a very serious one.. I personally know of a guy through my dad's ex wife who was clean for 4-5 years or something crazy, and one night he decided to relapse for one reason or another, maybe he did plan it out, who knows, but he clearly didn't plan well enough, because he nodded the FUCK OUT... in a really bad position apparently, because he ended up having to get BOTH of his legs amputated the day after or a couple days after. Niiice trade-off. I guess that dope he did better've had some decent legs hey? absolutely terrible joke, but you get the point.
4. If you're in a region where fentanyl and it's analogs are even remotely prevalent, which is alot of places now, smoking is the golden ticket to not dying.Take it from me, when I started out I was a snorter. I always did pretty small bumps of any drugs I ever snorted, because for one, i started out with coke first and I know from researching cocaine is ridiculously potent for what it is, I think I read that something like a pound of coca leaves produces a half gram of powder, or 1 pound equals 1 gram, something crazy.One thing to always remember is you can always take more, but you can't take less...IV'ing is the top method for ODing and dying I guarantee you.You don't know what's in your shit or how much, and once you press that plunger down there's no going back.at least when you're smoking you know the bioavailability is relatively low compared to other ROAs therefore decreasing your chance of OD and making it easier to titrate your dose up effectively. This is advice for some newer users, and some experienced users alike.
5. Lastly, don't be an idiot like I was in the beginning stages of starting doing opioids.I used to go to the studio every friday night and turn up with all my drugs and a drive full of my own beats ready to record some shit.the average friday night there consisted of a 40 or 60 oz bottle of hard liquor, usually vodka, a 0.5 to a gram of coke, and a couple quarter bags of down/''heroin'' aka fentanyl analogs since that's all thats out here now pretty much.literally most dope is colored weird colors here now, just cold copped a 0.1 of some shit that was kool-aid purple today.n when the guy was getting my shit another dude who was gonna bring me shit came back out and said he was 20 short of a reup and it wouldve been blue chunk dope. all colors of the rainbow now.BOTTOM LINE, DON'T MIX DOWNERS. NEVER MIX ALCOHOL WITH FENTANYL OR ANY OPIOIDS OR BENZOS FOR THAT MATTER, THESE GREATLY INCREASE CHANCE OF OVERDOSE.I swear the only reason I never OD'd when I was at the studio is because A) I take small bumps, and B) I was always doing coke along with the alcohol and down.

Finally, sorry for the giant post but I felt like some of this should get out there to some people on this sub.Just trying to make the world a safer place.As an addict myself, I know what were some of the factors in me NOT dying early on in life.I have a whole life ahead of me, I'm only 26, turning 27 next month.I feel old but I look WAY younger apparently. I just moved to a new neighborhood and the 80 year old neighbor next door asked me if I was going to highschool in the area... LOLAnyway I hope these tips help some people in this sub and I hope people take some of it to heart because I'm only trying to decrease the amount of people that have to die way too early in their lives. It's not worth this little drug. this drug and all the dealers selling it will be around for centuries to come, we only have one life here.

Anyway take care guys n gals & stay safe.",1555390623.0

I have boofed other drugs but I've read that boofing hydrocodone isn't that effective?

Lately I've been doing 2.5mg of heroin nasally every hour during the day for pain relief.  I take an extra 1.25-2.5mg when I work out or do something strenuous, and on occasion I need an extra 1.25mg just because my pain seems worse but for the most part it's 2.5mg every hour with edibles and smoking at night to go to sleep.  

I've been reading about methadone for pain and it seems while methadone has a silly long half life it only works on pain for about 6 hours, it also has a silly steep response curve starting at around 22.5-25mg.  The guides I was reading for methadone were saying how morphine can be used for breakthrough pain, although I assume the heroin I have would work just as well.  I was thinking of starting at 2.5mg of methadone 3x a day with heroin as needed and moving up to (if needed) 5mg of methadone 3x a day and then just having the heroin nasal spray as needed.  I'm avoiding getting close to the 22mg range, I don't wanna get hit with little effect then suddenly hit like a pile of bricks, especially not for like two days. 

Any of you experienced with using heroin on top of methadone?  Any warnings I need to be aware of other than methadone having a long life of respiratory depression so even if I don't feel the pain relief it can still be depressing me?  I wish pain doctors didn't have their hands tied so much, all the docs I've seen say they want to treat me with opioids but their hands are tied so here I am asking this sub about my pain relief plan haha.  

Thank you for any input, warnings, you have :)",1555355371.0

Feel suicidal lately,"I suffer from borderline personality disorder. I’m 25 years old female. My depression and anxiety is so crippling. I always have many intrusive thoughts which leads to mood swings and finally physical symptom — heart pain. I have committed suicide once this year.

Have you tried Tramadol for anxiety and depression and ocd(mostly intrusive thoughts)? How does it feel? My goal is to live in the moment(since I also have ADHD), less mood swings, emotionally less intense, relief from OCD and can control my own thoughts.

Life is hard for me. I cannot even sit down watch television WITHOUT intrusive thoughts. Just to wake up in the morning requires a lot of willpower. Everyday feeling suicidal. Even I have something good to happen. I feel anxious too. I’m afraid of losing them and feel the crippling heart pain again.

I’ve tried basically all the antidepressants and none of them do anything to me. Tramadol is pretty much my last chance. Thought about trying Kratom but feel most of the good comments are too good to be true. Which makes me wonder the vendors’ politics.

My plan is to take Tramadol 50mg x2 daily to receive the goal mentioned above. The tolerance is a big issue. How fast can you build a tolerance.

If the drug does not work or tolerance build up, I’ll eventually have to kill myself becoz of the pain of BPD.

Btw, how does it compare to benzo? ( the side effect, feeling, withdrawal)I’m on Xanax for a few months and feel the short term memory gets worse. And the withdrawal is uncomfortable. Benzo just makes me relax and comfortable but didn’t do much to the thinking. 

As a 25yo girl who desperately want to enjoy life, yet feeling everyday in the world is torturing. I really need your help. Thank you and please.

Edit: do you take it daily? How long have you been on it? How’s the tolerance? Thanks.

2nd edit: microdose is a wrong word. I mean use low dose like 50mg.",1555346486.0

JJ came in to save me twice but the devil fucked me over hard twice.,"Oh my god guys this has got to be the worst day of my life. i just got ripped off twice!! im here bawling my eyes out, shitting myself, throwing up in full blown withdrawals. let me explain to you guys what happened.

well everyday i struggle to get a fix. everyday i go through so much shit to get a fix. today i thought would be different. i was so happy. i woke up at 7am probably in 1/10 withdrawal mood. nothing to big. i have nothing left to pawn or sell. i can't middle man since all my friends who used got clean. i can't go donate plasma since i'm already known as a druggie. my connects won't front me. my family won't lend me or give me money. i had $2 in my pocket. so what did i do? i went out to buy a scratch off lottery ticket. i thought to myself might as well risk well. well lo and behold i won!!! i won freakin' $80. i was so darn happy. finally i'll be able to buy myself a nice gram.

so i head on over to my OG connects house thats like  2 blocks away from my crib. turns out he got raided 2 days ago. fuck! about 2 hours have passed and i'm already in a 3/10 withdrawal mode. so i say FUCK it and decide to bike 15 miles to a another connects place. by the time i get there i'm tired. i knock and knock and his mom comes out. ""X won't be here till about a 2 or 3 hours"" . so i head on over to the park that's a block away to kill time. a friend saw me there. he stopped by and asked if i was still on H. i say yes of course. he tells me he can take me to his ""super legit H connect."" i say sure. i put my bike in the back of his truck and we drive over there and its only like 8 blocks from the park. so i get off with my friend. he introduces me to his connect. we make small talk and then he pulls out some of the best smelling most beautiful looking heroin i've ever seen. $60 a gram! hell yeah. this is where i fuck up. the guy tells me to go buy him some coke at another connects house and he'll hook me up. the coke connect is 2 blocks away so i bike there. i pick up the coke and come back. i give him the coke and he hands me the supposed heroin in a baggy wrapped in duct tape. i thought weird but ok i already saw his stuff.. he tells me ""dont open it until you get home bro. its real hott out there wit  the police"" ok whatever. my friend takes me back home. when we get there he surprised me ""so wassup you gonna give me gas money"" because his tank is full.. ughhh i thought ok so i give him $10. ""nah bro come on i introduced you to a new bad ass connect. gimme another $10 or we'll have problems"". ok whatever i already have a gram so i give him my last $10.. then i take like 10 min trying to open it and its fucking salt!! fucking salt!! by this time i'm already in like 5/10 withdrawals pissed as fuck.

again i bike all the way to that guy who gave me the bunk. who's there? my supposed friend. i go up and start knocking hard as fuck. both of them come out high as fuck laughing in my face. ""WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT YOU JUNKIE?!?!?"" i'm calm with my voice fucking cracking and i just say ""i dont want any problems man. please just give me wants mine"" my supposed friend socks me in the face. i tried to fight back but i was withdrawing bad. i end up being chased away and barely managed to escape on my bike. 

then it happens again. i find a fucking $20 on the floor!!! hell yeah. so i head on over to my connects place. yes! his car is there. i knock like a mad man and he comes out. i tell him what happens. he tells me to bike home that he doesn't have nothing but he'll take me a a fat $20 sack in a while. i bike home again.. im tired as fuck! my legs are killing me. i've probably biked, no lie, close  to 50 miles at this point. by this time the sun is already going down. so im chilling and i hear the honk and go outside i really trusted this guy. i hand him my $20 and he gives me the shit how he usually use to give it to me. when i go inside to open it AGAIN ITS FUCKING BUNK!!! 

goddamn. i call him up. to make a long story short there's a rumor that the last time i was in jail is because i was arrested for child porn. BULL FUCKING SHIT. i was arrested for a fucking misdemeanor. so that rumor spread like wildfire and that's the reason they pulled that shit on me. i can't believe it y'all. it's 5AM here and i'm in full blown withdrawals. i really want to kill myself. i won't do it but i really wish i was dead. i called another connect, explained what happened, and though he was sympathetic he told me he doesn't front and isn't a charity.

god i don't know what to do. i'm really thinking of selling myself but man i will never suck dick for dope. what can i do to get money? at least $60 bucks to hold me over until friday. i tried begging at the gas station a few hours ago but there's already a chick there thats a junkie so most people give money to here. i begged like 20 different ppl and they all just blew me off. i even saw a old teacher of mine. i had been crying. i went up to him and flat out told him what happened. his reply? ""tough shit. get clean you tecato"". god that word  TECATO stings. its a derogatory term for junkie in spanish. man why are people so mean to junkies? i dont steal. yeah i'm a tecato but man i aint a piece of shit.

anyways... i cant donate plasma for money, i have nothing to pawn or sell, nobody will front me, nobody will lend me money and much less give me, i tried to tell my connect i'll wash his car/clean his house/etc and he said no, i've run out of options. WHAT CAN I DO FOR $60? i'm so damn desperate. i even tried going around the neighborhood to look for aluminum cans to sell in a few hours to at least make $10 to get a lil dime. i had collected a bag until someone called the cops on me. again i was treated like shit. cops know me around here so they fucked with me. ""Mr.X if you dont stopped sniffin around the neighborhood to steal someting i'ma book you."" MAN I'VE NEVER STOLEN ANYTHING.

sorry for the long incoherent rant guys. this has got to be the worst day of my pathetic junkie life. i have no idea how i'm gonna get my next fix. i wish i was fucking dead. i'm tired of this. i'm gonna get on  methadone but until friday. my aunts gonna pay for it. i tried to explain to her what happened and if she could at least give me $10 to get fixed but nope. i have no idea what im gonna do.. worst part is i've been getting shit laced with fentanyl so the withdrawals are bad. right now i'm at 10/10 withdrawals... shitting myself, runny nose, throwing up yellow, shakes, cold-sweats, the works...

anybody have any ideas? no stealing or prostituting or nothing illegal. pease guys i need help. any ideas or recommendations will be appreciated.

Who would have thought it'd come to this?
I'd almost rather just give in and slit my wrists.

I need help.
But others dont seem to like me
After all does anyone trust a junkie? Not likely.
I'm not asking you to love me when im wrong.
I've done bad things but not for too long.
Falling down and gaining speed.
Further and further from what I really need.

I need help.
Just understand this isn't the real me
I'll be back after facing my enemies.
They're growing stronger as I grow weak.
Happy thoughts skrink, life becomes bleak.
Never thought a needle would make me sink.
Forced to do things I wish I could undo
I admit my wrongs, what about you?

You find it easier to sit and criticise.
Until the day your dreams die and you realize.
Us two arent quite so far apart.
We all have demons that wreck the heart.

Healing is a process that requires another

I wish I had been blessed with a real mother.
Instead I got an example on how to fuck up.
Just a young pup with no grown up.
If leading by example was true.
I'd have no question of who lead who.
Pills were worth more than my brother or I

At most to her we'd just ruin her high

The floor was her bed and her sleep was a coma

All because of a pill called soma
Am I a hypocrite for not forgiving?
I'm not too different with the life that im living
Numbing out my feelings is what I know best

The needle answers my problems to life's test

I act as if im better than my mother

But I'm just as bad, I still hurt myself and others.

The light is getting dimmer as each day passes

I'm feeling as though im just following my family tradition

Ive seen her fail attempts at sobriety more times than I can count

Is that nothing more than a window to my future?

Do I even want to try to change if I know failure runs in my blood

I feel as though happiness is nothing more than a mere lie that people trick themselves into believing

Some are lucky and believe the lie,

Others like myself envy such people. 

Fake it till you make it they say.

Faking being content does nothing but make me wish I could feel like that for real. 

I know I'm most likely wrong and true happiness exists but for every extra year I live I seem to have more reasons to keep numbing out. Hell compared to a lot of the world my life has way fewer reasons to be unhappy and ive actually got many reasons to clean up but history repeats and it seems more logical to maintain the level of unhappiness I'm at than to attempt to get out of this pit only to fall into a deeper one almost immediately.

He was supposed to get some DAYS ago, but it’s been radio silence since he told me he’d have something. Oh well. I’m in withdrawal right now. It’s been about 19 or 20 hours since my last dose. I’m on 350mg of soma and 300mg of gabapentin, so I’m not feeling too shabby but I know it’s only going to get worse. 

Honestly this addiction has ruined my fucking life. I only take 40mg a day (sometimes 30 and 20mg when I’m running low) but it’s still total shit. I really want to get off this shit before I’m stuck in this game forever. I guess my question is: how bad are the withdrawals going to be from 1 year of 40mg of hydro a day? I’m an emetophobe, basically meaning I’m deathly terrified of throwing up. That’s the main reason why I haven’t made it past day 2 of withdrawals. I can deal with all of the other withdrawal symptoms, but if I’m going to be vomiting from it then I have to find something to stave it off. 

So, can I get clean and get rid of this habit without having to throw up during WDs? I’m really worried about day 3, as it’s highly regarded as the worst day of opioid withdrawals. If I can make it there without having any episodes of emesis, then I might actually be able to live a clean life. I guess I don’t really have a choice in getting clean, considering how dry everything is in my area.

I'm 18 years old and I don't want this to be what my life is like. But the choices I've made have already pretty much guaranteed that, to some degree, I will always struggle with thus addiction. I have some notable chronic pain in both my back and my legs, and have always had trouble sleeping. So heroin has essentially been a mericle drug for me. I feel like there is no going back once you've had the cure. 

I hear a lot of recovering addicts talk about their drug if choice like it's this awful thing that wont leave me alone. Though I want to quit, I don't feel that way about heroin. Those two months, feeling my body, just left me crying every day. The thought of never feeling like I was able to run around or focus enough for schoolwork loomed over me every second of it until I gave in.

How can I get better at registering and staying in a vein? My veins don’t really bulge out much. I’ve looked at veins maps online but most of them are just drawings and I can’t match my vines up with them.

Also, what sort of aftercare should I be looking into to treat all my failed attempts at shooting? Mostly my arms just feel bruised not too swollen or anything. Is it just  matter of the needle punctures to heal?


Some back story:

So I just starting IV’ing, I used to exclusively snort. My current cycle is to binge for a week, use Kratom to get through the WD’s and then go 10 days clean before getting the vivitrol shot for at least 3/4 months before I rinse and repeat.

Anyway, since I’m new to IV’ing I’ve been taking it slow - always doing tiny shots first to test the strength, always using clean rigs for each new shot, sterile cotton and water and I always sanitize the area before and after I shoot.

My problem is, I’m having a huge problem registering the vein, and when I do eventually get it, I stay in for only half the shot really before it try to register again and it’s come out of the vein and I can’t get it back in. It makes it hard to keep trying because after a few partial registers that don’t take, the shot is filled with blood and it’s hard to see if I’m registering anymore after that.

I’ve missed a few shots already and after so many attempts of trying to find a vein and register for the whole shot to go in; I’m left with mad needle marks and sore arms.

I think I should be okay with not getting an abscess (I was very particular with sterilization and I don’t see any signs of the areas I used deteriorating, but it I’ll keep and eye on it.

Good part is, I did it - and I'm not going back.

Bad part is... I can't seem to find anything (legal) that will touch the euphoria that comes with opiate use. You know, the warm blanket / heaven on earth / everything is alright for eternity type stuff.

I have done research into different supplements and tried a few and the closest time I have ever gotten on my quest is once at the gym, I did cardio for 45 minutes on an empty stomach, got off the machine and swallowed a Kava (piper methysticum) capsule. 20 minutes later, on the ride home, I was feeling that familiar warm wash of contentment, peace and relaxation that I miss. It didn't last long, but like I said, its the closest I have gotten. I have since tried Kava and it never feels like it did that time at the gym. So I am thinking it must have been a perfectly timed mixture of a supplement that affects GABA and good old fashioned runner's high. In the past I have also tried two different types of Kratom and felt nothing.

Can you suggest anything you have found that produces a similar type of euphoria and well being as opiates? Or is it just a fool's errand to keep searching...",1555277129.0

I’ve been on an opiate binge the last 3 months. Before that had a period of clean time and on and off using for the last 10 years. So I’m not new to this, but this is a new experience. 

Within the last month, i found a good connect who’s hooked me up with very good dope. It’s good stuff and I’ve just had the weirdest experience over the past week with the same stuff I’ve been using for about a month now. 

I am having crazy muscle spasms and RLS in my whole body (especially my legs). I woke up from a nod kicking my legs in the air. I feel like my muscles have to keep moving I don’t think it’s possible for me to be in wd, because it does not subside when i use more...  I feel like I look like a fish out of water squirming non-stop. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? 

Are there any medications that could potentially create these symptoms? Is there anything the dope could be cut with that would create this?

A guy I’ve made an exchange or two with before was someone I contacted yesterday in hopes of finding a plug as I’ve been having a bit of a dry spell. (Background: I’m a female and he is about twice my size.) He woke me up early via texts saying he had the hook up. Drove to meet him. He wants to come to my car window, but I insist he gets in the car. I get my money out and (stupidly) start to hand it to him. We both are gripping the bills when I stop and say I want to see it first. He gets edgy, but hands it to me. I start to open the folded paper and he says “I don’t know nothing bout that”. It’s obviously empty and I tell him to fuck off. At this point I’ve dropped the money down by my feet (in driver seat of car). He FULL ON TACKLES ME & repeatedly yells “give me my money”. I started laying on the horn, but it didn’t deter him one bit. At this point he’s straight up physically assaulting me. I give up. It’s not worth getting hurt. Let him grab the cash ($80). He hops out the car and takes off. 

I sat there stunned for a moment until my senses came back & I locked the doors, but he was long gone. I took off for home. After a bit of driving I look down in my passenger seat and his phone is sitting there. Instant. Fucking. Karma. I quickly realized I shouldn’t bring his phone home with me in case he has a phone locator app. I threw it out my window as I was going about 55mph.

How much do you get each time? Do you have to go in every time to get a single dose or will you receive several days worth and is this the same for both methadone and subutex? (Not that I plan on misusing it in any way but I want to visit my family for Easter so I won’t be able to pick it up daily and would rather not be withdrawing) Do you have to collect them from the drug service itself or do they give you a script that would allow me to pick it up from a pharmacy closer to home?
Finally, any reasons why I should be looking to get methadone over buprenorphine/subutex or vice versa? I don’t want to be on maintenance long term I intend to taper off as quickly as possible (currently on 100mg oxycodone daily).

I am also very depressed and opiates seem to fix all the problems: depression, diarrhea, and stomach pain.

Is it possible to get a prescription for codeine pills in the USA? Will a doctor give it for something untypical like this? I feel like this is the best option for me because it solves all of the problems. I don't want a strong opiate because I know they won't work forever and may eventually cause negative effects.

bcyxiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bcyxiv/fentanyl_identification/,5,https://redd.it/bcyxiv,BlueWaffleScoffle,Fentanyl Identification,"Hey there so I usually buy pure d I'm from MA so its always ECP and I'm quite Familiar with identifying if product is cut or not. My usual source is never cut w fent which I know is rare and I've actually wondered if it's just morphine. The whole type 1, 2, 3, 4 thing confuses me. I just smoke it off foil and occasionally sniff it. Now recently I found a new source and I'm Familiar with buying straight fent before. I've also bought alot of product cut w fent. Just the way it burns is one key give away.

Anyway my main point is if anyone on here can help me with some pointers on how to identify the purity of straight fent. Like what should it smell like, taste like, what texture and what it should look like, how it should burn, etc. I was wondering if this was even a good plug or not, I know I'm high but it's just hard to tell because I took my suboxone the other day so it's not hitting me as hard as it should be, that and my tolerance is through the roof. Anyway any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. I know the effects are stronger than real d but less euphoric and ""fun"", and only lasts a couple hours or so compared to the real d I'm use to getting.

 I also have experience with the gray stuff around as ECP which is a mixture of several different ""fentalogues"", and man has nothing ever before ever gotten me that high or fucked up. I'm not sure there was any dope or analogues of morphine /diamorph at all, but man i have never had better drugs in my entire life. I think it had Carfent and it was extremely pure like hardly any non-drug cut in it at all, again it was ECP and it was a light-dark gray color and it HAD to be at least a handful of different fentalogues and the high lasted a while but i was never more fucked up in my life. Sadly I've only ever had the fortune of getting that once in my life, as the person who got it for me was a huge asshole (which is way too fucking common for the game around here) and it's just too difficult to go through them again and according to them its rare and hard for them to find anyway. They always try n rob me by charging just to have them help me find shit anyway. But yeah that gray shit was the best high I had EVER gotten and all I did was smoke a tiny ass little 0.01 bump if that off of foil and was instantly blasted.

But yeah I'm looking for tips and pointers now on identifying good quality and pureness of fentanyl purchases. I bought it as dope but I'm experienced enough to tell what I get especially cuz my usual source is straight dope (or morphine I've questioned before if it was). I've bought straight fent in the past and it didn't t burn well although this stuff burns fairly easy, though it is harder to smoke than dope is which I know is a tell tale sign of fent. Dope usually melts easily into a redish blackish color liquid and this stuff melts similarly although it is mostly burning and not melting to liquid which is what I know fent to do. It has no smell but the smoke tastes super sweet, idk if it's a cut like sugar or if that's a sign of fent. I don't know if this is quality or not and I'm just looking for any info anyone out there may have on identifying fentanyl and the quality of it.

Also bare with me this is my first time on reddit I just made the account like a week ago but I do constantly google reddit forums they have the best info and is an amazingly helpful and just generally a really great site source and forum.
So I hope i didn't do anything wrong and if i did i apologize and ask you to pls just kindly have patience w me and just let me know what i did wrong so I can know to avoid it in the future.

But all and any feed back and help my fent problem is greatly appreciated, thank you so much!!!!!!!! Wish everyone the best stay safe and happy nodding!!!!!!",1555213866.0

I have chronic pain everyday and thats enough in itself but currently I have broken & infected teeth. I cant chew. I can barely talk. its miserable. 

now heres my question- I get a small script from my dr. she lowered my dose DRASTICALLY and I convinced her to put it up a little, which is still less than what I have been on for years. this pain is out of this world and I am completely out of meds. i’m not due til friday. I cant go to er as theyll do nothing. I planned on calling today & leaving a message being honest. ive been taking more the past few days bc its just unbearable and asking if I can get it monday or tuesday instead. if she wants to see me, I have no qualms since its obvious my face is swollen. 

am I rocking the boat here ? I dont wanna push it as if im fucked if I lose this script but to expect me not to need any extra is just crazy. also: if I were to get it monday, that means I took 13 extra this month. so idk how thatd play out bc thats more than a couple extra. idk. my other problem is she only does 2 or 3 week scripts. this is hard as I live an hour away from her office / my pharmacy atm. so I feel like if I ask for a full script and asking early, ill fuck it all up. but I really cant wait. idk.

edit: I feel like I should just ask to come in regardless. words get twisted by nurses and I dont want it becoming misconstrued. but I do think I should still call as a warning so that she feels comfortable when I come in. or should I just ask if I can be seen monday and not leave message. idk !!",1555177271.0

Started off with an injury, and was prescribed Norco.   That ramped up to ridiculous amounts prescribed monthly by a pain management Dr.  Eventually, I was running out of my scripts earlier and earlier until the Dr noticed and cut me off.  I tapered with what little I had and soon went through the shear hell withdrawing.  Well being the addict I am, I started back with the pills within a few months and when that was not enough, I was introduced to BTH.  After a while I got on suboxkne and tried my best but continued to use when a better alternative presented itself.  So basically would stop the subs, go on a  bender and then coming crawling back to the subs.  
Now here I am on a solid 6 weeks of daily BTH and/or Fentanyl ecp.   Obviously the subs are totally out of my system by now and I am over spending every minute of each day preparing my next shot, far too much time spent trying to find a useable vein bc they are all completely shot.  My ankles and feet were are frighteningly swollen (never injected there ironically) my hands are puffy, bruises and marks everywhere.  I look awful.  I’m ready to be done.  SO, .....my question now is wait till W/D and get back on the suboxone , then eventually taper off of them OR taper with the  2 gm of Heroin I have left.   I am a huge pus and scared out of my mind bc I know I’m gonna go through hell, mentally and physically, followed by the months on end of PAWS depression     The whole thing just sucks.

My tolerance was pretty high, so I thought (in comparison to a lot of people here, probably low), and I was taking recreationally mostly. I would take about 40mg at a time at time to get an okay euphoric feeling, then once that stopped working, I started snorting back in about early 2018.

&#x200B;

So after not even an entire 12 months of snorting oxy, I was snorting about 30-40mg at a time at my highest point, until around January this year, where some weird things start happening. I would snort about 10mg at a time, always have, but now suddenly I was feeling really light headed, faint, and super anxious. My anxiety was forming from the idea in my head that I was going to overdose and die, I guess? It sounds ridiculous, but that's just how it feels. I would feel so dizzy and faint, when I stand up I get that dizzy tunnel vision, my breathing would feel shallow and it constantly feels as if I will just stop breathing if I'm not manually taking breaths (this is after only 10mg, remember I used to take 40 in a matter of minutes). Just last month, I was snorting in 5mg increments and had to stop after just 10 because I started to freak out, even went to my girlfriend and mom saying I felt like I was going to pass out and blamed it on my ""anemia"".

I really don't know what's been going on, I don't know what happened in the first place, if what I'm experiencing now is just completely psychosomatic, etc. I've tried doing research on this and nobody what kind of stuff I search, I cannot find anyone with this experience at all.

Back in the hayday of OxyContin *circa 2008-2010* my roommate and I would regularly make trips down to Mexico, where we had a pharmacy that we'd frequent to get large quantities of Soma.

The MP58's... 

We'd go and get anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 of them at like.... Roughly 10 cents each depending how many we grabbed. 

Then we'd bring em back, where they sold consistently for $1 a pop. 

Sometimes $1.50. 

So, if we brought down a thousand bucks, we'd make 10 grand back by the end of the week. 

Sweet gig! But besides the point...

His girlfriend's mom had cancer. Real bad, stage 3. And she was prescribed on OC 80's... 

The *real deal*.... Them *BIG DOGS*... lol.

She hated em. Didn't take em, ever! 

Said they didn't do anything for her but she lovvvvvved Soma.

So, she tossed up an offer to us, in which she'd trade us her OC80's for our Somas at a 1:1 ratio.

Pill for pill... Soma for OxyContin 80mg.

I forget if she was getting 120 or 160 or what it was but it was between 120 & 180 count per month.

Regardless, at our cost it was under $20 investment for a script of 80s (which we sold for $50/ea but retailed up to $80/ea)

So I was just sitting here reminiscing on when we'd pay $18 *give or take a buck* for a script that we'd get $7,500 to $12,500 out of. 

And this was a MONTHLY arrangement which lasted for close to a year before she passed away. RIP Lisa!

The good old days!

Luckily mine have been but DAMN...

They are flawwwwlesss counterfeits! 

I got legit scripts for 6 or 7 years and straight up.... I would have called them authentic pharma, based on visual inspection!

Though a friend of mine says she's seen some sketchy presses that are crumbly & inconsistent doses.... One will do nothing & another will smack your ass into Nodville.

Anyway...

My buddy came back from the army & thought he was dabbling in roxi 30s for a few months and then it turns out that they were really Fenties.

When he eventually DID run into some authentic A-30s, he said they didnt do not neir nada nothin' for him.

Needless to say, now HE is balls deep in an opiate addiction again & dabbling with BTH.

I hadnt eaten much the day prior or at all this particular morning. We get into the restaurant, i order nuggets and fries and a side of mac n cheese. I eat it all. As soon as i take my last bite i start to stare off into the distance, get a horrid sinking feeling and my vision is a tunnel and super blurry around the edges. Something possessed me to jump up and scream ""IM GOING TO DIE HOLY SHIT IM DYING CALL AN AMBULANCE"" so as mentioned before, i just briefly stared off into the distance. WRONG... My friend told me i was blank faced, mouth gaping open for 5 MINUTES and she couldnt get my attention at all until i sprung up screaming. Ambulance gets there, my blood sugar was at 42 which he said was almost lethal. I left the hospital and went home and slept but i felt like crap for weeks.

And I want to thank the people who sent their support it really gave me the boost I needed. 

So I successfully completed the buprenorphine quick taper. But the first 19 hours were complete hell. It took two hours to even get into the level one room which is a big room with 30 recliner chairs which is where you spend your first 23 hours but is often not the case. And I was throwing up in there. And the nurse was this jamaican lady and she was a BITCH. it was like she was annoyed that I was so sick. And after being there for several hours i was telling her my symptoms and she was getting mad and saying ""well look I've already given you all that I can"" but in just a rude bitchy tone. And this tech lady that was there was fucking cool man her name was Maria and you can tell she grew up in a hood because how she talked and she even talked about her hood too. Anyway she was awesome because she went into the nurses  room and advocated for me big time and she told me she had my back and she would make sure that the nurse that would work the next shift would know how bad I'm suffering and I believe that she played a big part in me getting into the medical unit which is where they do the buprenorphine taper. 

After 12 hours I was finally taken to the medical unit at about 1 am Tuesday. And I was told that the rest of the night would be rough because the doctor wouldn't be in till 830 or 9 am. So it sucked and I got next to no sleep. But at 8 they served breakfast and I ate as much as I can but it did not feel good but I knew I should. And I saw the doctor just before 9 am and he told me they would do a 4 day buprenorphine taper starting with two 8mg doses on the first day one 4mg one 8mg dose on the 2nd day two 4 mg doses on the 3rd day and one 4mg dose on the last day which was today. And it helped to put it lightly. And they normally send people off with a script for suboxone for it bridges them till they get set up on a sub program with their respective agency. But I said no that I wanted to get off everything. I dont want my body dependent on anything anymore. And I know that the odds are against me on that but my gf is a big reason for that. She doesnt like me being on anything. AND I agree cuz I dont want to be dependent on anything. 

So that's what happened guys. I know I might still get a little sick tomorrow or the next day. But it wont be devastating like it was on Sunday night to Tuesday morning.

I know it's not over yet. But I'm here back home with my girlfriend the person who is my world. Shes amazing and without her I know would've been in a worst spot. I'm so grateful.

Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to proceed from here? I would appreciate it. Thx.",1555126076.0

&#x200B;

So at the end of december I jumped off 15mg of methadone after being on it for 4 years. Since then I have used sporadically (nothing for the first month after jumping off and on weekends after that). I was at home, at my parents when I was detoxing from the methadone and the city where the live is where my addiction developped so I have a few good connects there. I had been getting the purple fent/heroin (Canada) and it was always good. Sometimes it would hit me like a bus and other times I'd have to smoke a .1 and then i'd be captain of the nod squad.

&#x200B;

Since I moved back with my girlfriend at our house (2.5 hours from my parents) we would drive down to our hometown once a week or so to grab. As luck would have it, one of my old plugs from University (same town where my girlfriend and I live now) is able to find the ""same stuff"" (purple down). But hooooooly fuck is it annoying. He's good with meeting and the prices are the same but I literally just got 4 tokes out of .2 which would normally get my girl and I nodding hard.

Someone I'm close to has been using about 4 pills a day of hydrocodone (sometimes 2-3 more, but I don't know the dosage), along with klonopin and muscle relaxers (all prescribed for pain and some other chronic issues). I think at one point during the script a few pills were borrowed and it may have been up to 6-8, and has been at least 80 per month for the last couple years although I don't know the exact dosage.

After having some issues and a scary experience while drinking he decided to talk to his doctor about taper down and stopping. That was about 3 weeks ago, the DR had him go from \~4 down to 2/day for a week, then 1/day for a week, then 1 half which is where we are now. Last night was the first time I noticed any seriously noticeable side effects, he ate some fast food and then laid in bed moaning about stomach pain and had the shits for like an hour and a half.

Still doing the muscle relaxers and klonopins.

The last half dose is next Wednesday, I really didn't think that the dosage would be so high as to cause acute withdrawls, but his Doctor said that would happen. There have been some complaints about headaches and other symptoms, and mood swings, but until yesterday nothing really noticeable to me until this stomach issue.

 

I really have no idea how strong the withdrawal would be after the last dose compared to what is happening now with 24 hours between what looks like a pretty small dose, anyone have any thoughts or advice on what to expect? I am way out of my area of knowledge here.",1555116731.0

It happens, easier than you thought given the anxiety. You even manage to have a pretty decent night, then comes the most deceitful of thoughts.

“Hey, maybe I won’t get sick, after all, it’s not like I was going too hard. I’ve been worse.”

Worst nightmares of your life, all bringing the things and people that matter most to youcinto some horrific scenario.

Then you wake up sweating and suddenly you can feel the cold air penetrating both of your nostrils through a thick, wet layer of what your body is trying to use as protection.

Oh boy, I’ve got a cold. Nothing I can’t handle.

Another week of use and you awaken to the same experience that has air feeling like a weapon that nature is using against your body, this time you can feel the skin around your nostrils cracking. You’re not dumb. None of us are. We know and we knew what was coming. We just pray every time that maybe it won’t be so bad (after all, how can withdrawal from a high be more intense than the high itself?)

Take the day off, you’ve got a cold, you tell your family. THANK GOD. I’ve scored a day of rest from this hellish earth. You lay, watch some YouTube, but when you try to go back to rest...

Man, I can’t rest without a kick or a twitch every 30-50 seconds. Maybe I’m in more trouble than I realized. Before you know it, you’ve been lying in bed all day, just waiting to be tired enough to fall back to sleep in hopes that when you wake up you’ll be dead or feel better.

Heh. Funny thing about withdrawals is they always take just long enough to kick in for you to MAYBE believe you’ll get off Scott-free.

You lie awake, checking the clock every hour to see how much sleep you’ve gotten. It’s always none. Before you know it, the air that was acting so aggressively toward your nose is doing the same everywhere. You can FEEL the air against your skin, and it near FREEZES you. You wrap yourself tight under the covers, gripping them harder than you’ve ever held anything in an attempt to fight this like you would a fever, until suddenly you realize you’re equally uncomfortable there.

Your family is shocked. You haven’t been sick in years minus the one time you had withdrawals. No way this will be that bad, right?

Suddenly your mind starts to tell you what it is that will make you feel better. “But wait, how can a painkiller completely cure my flu?” 

You’ve got time and a little bit of extra cash. You figure, after walking into walls from taking so much Benadryl (in an attempt to sleep), maybe it’s worth another hundo to get something that’ll actually make me feel better. Hit up the dope man, he takes your money (yea yea never let your money walk and I’ve paid the price already a few times).  8 hours pass; and you barely had the ability to walk outside and leave him the money.

After nearly breaking down to cry, you get the thumbs up. Suddenly you can feel an anticipation you had no idea you would experience, nearly SHOUTING “FUCK YES” to yourself.

Package procured, contents dumped, and nothing could be better. You’re finally starting to feel normal again, so you can resume your regular intake and daily activities.

You take that bump the dealer warned you about, and...

Here I am. I’ve always known exactly what it was I was doing to myself. I never usually make it past a few weeks before the pain of addiction forces me to give it up.

This time, after another semester at school, a lifetime of fucking up, and finally having everything under control....

This time it cures all the pain.

But this time, I’m going to keep going with school and life. Sick or not.

I fucking hate seeing kids at school suffering trying to make a MINIMAL life for themselves. The only dream they’ve ever had and society just crushes it for so many.

Fortunately, for me, that isn’t the problem, but the pain of seeing a world so lost in its pursuit of anything but human.


Another dose, please.

Much love to all of you.",1555116146.0

About 5 to 10mg each time I dose. I have been under this weekend recreational routine for about 3 years now. 

At first I felt like I wasn’t physically dependent on it but now I’m not so sure. I feel light withdrawal symptoms during the week with the worst of it on Thursdays. But I still continue to take a dose on Friday and continue through the weekend. I use it over the weekends to stay productive and get a lot of shit done. Also I have a very active life style and play sports, do yoga etc. 

Problem is that I know deep inside that I have a light physical dependence and definitely a mental dependence but based on the withdrawal symptoms I get during the week it feels like I can manage to quit without too much nasty side effects when I decide to do it.

My questions below and I would love to get your advice and experience:

Assuming I can continue the discipline of limiting my use only to Fri-Sun and don’t increase the dose will my withdrawal symptoms get worse overtime and therefore harder to stop later on or would they stay the same?

I also worry that I may have skipped the worst of withdrawals as I take a break from Mondays to Thursdays. I take my last dose on Sunday morning and next does Friday noon / afternoon. Could it be that I have never felt the worst of the withdrawals yet?

Curious to see if there are others using methadone recreationally over weekends for a long time and if they have been able to continue the discipline? What doses and what are your experiences?

I feel like I'm posting a lot, it's just something else to be able to to talk openly with folks who *get* it.

My buddy has been on suboxone for over a year and a half, maybe even two. He's up at about 18mg. He's always hated the side effects, struggles with appointments and working and feeling like shit.

He's about as ""sober"" as he's going to be. He'll skip a day and use, here or there. Kind of knows what he can get away with. He's not really feeling that it cuts his 'wanting' and he puts it off so it's a couple times a year.

He's scared shitless of the wd. He's tired of it, done it before. Fast. Slow. It all sucks and he's so, so tired of it.

He's sometimes, with mixed results, switching to a short active opiate and then quitting that. Kind if lowering the half life, and then being able to control that taper easier. Either another opiate, or like benzos. 

Is that crazy? Or is tapering off the subox better? He can't trust his doctor anymore, it's a new one. Has seen ""medically assisted detox"" in places, does that mean they'll use medication or just lock you in and force you into meetings while you're in the shit?

Need advice,"I’m basically at a bottom from a financial standpoint. But mostly because I don’t have a job at the moment. Although I guess more money=more drugs. 
However I’ve been doing iv cocaine on top of my prescribed klons and subutex (I also iv these out of habbit), along with random other opiates when I can find them (heroin, fentanyl,morphine but only when they can be bad i.e. 2-3 times a month) so I’m essentially on subs 27/30 days a month and other opioids rarely. 
But i have had some trouble shaking this cocaine rush. 
I’ve Been to treatment 5 times already (completed 3, left 2 early) and have wanted sobriety in the past and failed. 

Long story short , at this point I’m not sure if I am back into the full on every hour speedball junkie I was before my last treatment (October 18) or if I’m in a backslide that could stop or crumble even more. 
I don’t know if even know want sobriety to be honest. 
I don’t want to leave my girlfriend (she had 1 year and did Roxie’s with me after a couple of days of knowing each other and now uses with me) 

I don’t want to go sit in a treatment that I’ve been to twice. I’ve heard all there is to hear I feel. If it worked , why am I not sober? 

Sorry for rambling, just kind of woke up after 24 hours of sleep from a 3 day no sleep coke/fent binge with one shot of meth mixed in from my brothers peer pressure. I never stay up 2 nights in a row , one maybe but that  meth threw me off. I really don’t like it. 
I just smoked some weed for the first time in a while and took a klonopin to chill out a bit and got kind of introspective on life and cane here for some answers I guess. 

I just need some advice of some sorts and I don’t even know what my question is. Any answers are appreciated. Thank y’all, seriously

Edit right after typing : I do have private insurance and can go to decent treatments. 
My dad did an intervention of sorts on me yesterday too (get out of my rent house within the week if you don’t have a job, Give me my truck, don’t come to my house) 
He offered treatment. Not sure of cost conditions but it’s usually 1k or so out of pocket. I think they want me to be put on a contract to repay that not sure. Was whacked out) 
So yes I can go to treatment with low cost options",1555090092.0

My skin gets extremely itchy when I'm on heroin/opiates. It got to the point where it's non-stop itching for around 3-4 hours after snorting. My whole skin turns red from all the scratching and it's really not enjoyable.

I'm using a coolpack right now to sort of make it go away and also used creme, but it doesn't really work. Do you guys know what I can do to reduce the itch? Am I maybe even allergic to heroin?

So being sick sucks, even if it’s just a little sickness, it sucks. But the way I do subs after a binge, I hardly ever even feel sick at all.

Note: this might not work for everyone, but it works for me and remember, someone only takes oxy, no H, pressies or anything else....

So after a binge, around the 9-11 hour mark(before any WD symptoms begin), I’ll take about .75 - 1 mg of a sub, then I’ll wait about an hour and a half to 2 hours and take another 1mg, then I’ll wait another 90 minutes and up my dose of subs to 1.5 - 2 mg’s and again, I’ll wait another 90 minutes and repeat that dose. Sometimes if I’m paranoid enough, I’ll repeat that dose after another 90 minutes or I’ll up the dose to 3mg’s. Then I’ll wait another 2 hours then take 4mgs, then I’ll wait a while (like the next morning or late at night, depending on when I started tapering onto subs) before dosing again, and usually that next dose is a whole 8mgs to help completely kick WDs ass. 

Once I have everything under control and I’m not getting PWD or any WD for that matter, I’ll take 1.5mgs in the morning and 1.5mgs at night each day and I’ll feel fine.

Please keep in mind, taking subs too soon can be very dangerous, I would hate to see anyone get PWDs, but at the same damn time. If I can help some ppl beat getting sick by using this method than great! But I would only try it if you knew you had real oxy or uncut dope.",1555068050.0

I have a few questions about trying these oxys, i am planning on taking 15mg and possibly another 5 after an hour if not at desired effect.

1- i am planning to crush the tablets to remove the time release mechanism - has anyone got experience with this?

2 - i am worried about nausea - should i take promethazine along with them to combat this and itch?

3- i have alot of experience with weed and might smoke a joint along with it - is this a good combo? 

4 - does oxy result in a ‘hangover’ effect the next day?

I'm out of my methadone about a week early, due to a shitty car accident 3 weeks ago that caused me to take an extra or two for over a week. I've been taking steroid packs to help, but it's only taking the edge off. I already have fibromyalgia and DDD, among other things. So after two days out of everything and the withdrawal pangs of restless legs, mood swings and terrible stomach upset, my friend who said he had something for me still hasn't answered me. Fuck it, I'll just drive over. Then I have to walk up a steep ass dirt road to his house and see if he's there.  His lights are on, he's home. He's sitting on 20 norco 10s. Thank fuck, it's at least something. But now I've got to turn around and drive to an ATM, because I didn't want to pull anything out prematurely because I know if I did he magically wouldn't be home or wouldn't have anything (cause that's just how the luck in my universe works).  So I hobble down the hill, drive to the nearest gas station....they're closed, alright, let's continue to the place by my house. They're open, cool. Marilyn Manson's Dope Show is playing on the radio as I pull up.   I go to use the ATM, and hit the amount I want to withdraw. Just before it starts to make that little hum as it releases your money, I look down at the slot. I see a tiny corner of green already sitting there, and the humming began. I pull out the cash from the slot...count it... FUCK YES there's an extra $20 there, someone didn't grab all their cash and left a bill. It was like the excitement of getting a free coin back at the arcade for a game you didn't even play!  Only ten times more. Nothing like this ever happens to me, and yet I've given my last dollars to help others so many times. I felt like a light was being shown on me, and my immediate thought was, ""there is a God!"" After 11 years of this pain and never catching a break, it just felt like a little something nice as payback. I got back in the car and Rival Son's Do Your Worst is playing (oh, the irony). I got back and hiked up that big ass hill again with my joints aching, stopping for breath every few steps. Got what I needed finally.  Some days I feel I'd practically kill to end this chronic pain. That extra 20 will at least cover the withdrawal for another day...so I'm happy.  Those of you that play this game recreationally... consider yourself lucky.  If I didn't have pain I wish I'd never have to go this route. But I'm thankful for my little green glimmer of help today.

&#x200B;

Having had a truly exceptional day of divine intervention injection, I decided I'd try my hand at the same hustle one more time.  Like a gentleman, I went ahead and used all of the free bags that first day when I got them and enjoyed a day smacked and cracked out of my skull.  Unfortunately, though, even though it was just a day of use, I ended up with withdrawals nonetheless (thanks a lot old age and history of use).  I got on my hustle and hit a lick today, by some crazy miracle I sold old luggage from the 80's for $700 (I'm still not sure if I got ripped off or the old lady from CraigsList did), but I couldn't help myself trying to still get my dope for free (free dope is the best dope).

&#x200B;

With a swollen pocket, I hopped on the train, smiling ear-to-ear, confident I'd be returning with another cornucopia of free drugs.  Again, as I approached my main spot, my dope boy comes running at me.  Everything was lining up as it did the first time, I'm already halfway to a chub I'm so excited.  Before I can get a word out, though, he says ""Ready to come back to the dark side?""  As my heart sank and my smile turned to a turbo frown, I went ahead and paid for a bag to avoid suspicion, made an awkward joke, and scurried off like we junkies do.  Funny how when the dope boys owe me he practically has Alzheimer's, but when I owe him he is like a goddamn elephant.  Things had taken a sharp left turn rather promptly.

&#x200B;

I proceeded to hit the other two dopes spots I shop at, neither of those dope boys were amused nor did they forget the freebies from the other day either.  Accordingly, while I was rather disheartened, I went ahead and paid for a bag from each of them.  I was still far from willing to give up, though, so I decided to try my hand at two spots I have never shopped at before.  Not only were those gentlemen not amused, one of them actually stuck a knife to my tum tum.  I am not sure what he intended to do with that knife in my belly, but having positively no desire to find out, I actually copped two bags off of him, made my go-to awkward joke, and scurried off like a crackhead in sunlight.

&#x200B;

While I was now decently stocked on a variety platter of dope, and I managed to also grab three bags of crack on the way to the train station, I was still disheartened, my faith in Junkie Jesus tested.  Looking for answers, I decided to blow through the variety of dope I'd just bought, of course toking on some crack here and there along the way.  I finally made my way to the two bags from the gentleman with the edged weapon and, as soon as I tooted them, I knew there was some trickery afoot.  Star wipe to 45 minutes later and I come to half-naked, 30 blocks from my home, walking down the shoulder of a major highway.  I wish I could say that was the first time I'd done that.

or years throughout active addiction, I asked what I now know is my higher power for help. My higher power works slowly but methodically. 

I call her Karma, but not karma in the traditional sense - well sorta. Karma for me is defined as:

>a greater spiritual force that guides the way your life can go. If you put good karma in prayers will be answered, if you put out bad energy or karma you may remain stuck for a long period of time.

Throughout my addiction, I tried to be a good person. Even though my friend and I had a falling out, I still gave her a good recommendation for a job roughly 4 years ago. (this is important for later on) As time progressed during the last year of my addiction I was completely hopeless. I wanted to die or change. 

I just didn't know how to change and that's when I was on OkCupid. I wasn't taking it seriously and was really just messing about there in my own misery. I had originally gone on there to troll men for good r/creepypms content, but for some reason, I didn't bait anyone. Instead, I ended up having a conversation with someone. 

We'll call him Josh. Well, Josh was nice. We chatted for two days and decided to go on a date. He had no idea I was at the worst point in my life in terms of my addiction. Well, Josh and I started dating and 3 months into that I made the decision on November 23rd, 2017 to become clean. That was my first attempt.

It lasted me 100 days before I relapsed and went on a 4-month long run. Then June 8th, 2018 I attended my first meeting ever. I was 8 days clean. I was still shaking from my withdrawals, but I was on the tail end of it. I fell in love with meetings at that moment. 

I stayed clean for 60 days before having a 1-day relapse because, I fell down, but I got right back up. I pushed forward and I relapsed on October 8th, 2018. Again, another 1-day relapse. This time I stood up stronger than ever. I went with a new fiery force to seize my recovery. 

I started really working Step #1 and On October 9th I took a step of bravery and let my boyfriend, Josh, in. I told him every single one of my dirty secrets. Complete and raw honesty. We talked well into the middle of the night and ended up strengthing our relationship. Then on October 16th, 2018 Josh proposed and became my fiance. 

I know we're not supposed to make major decisions in the first year of recovery, but for me, Josh & I were already living together. We had moved into an apartment close to my friends and were building a life together. Plus, we're still not married, the date is sometime for Summer 2020. I digress.

I could not believe that Josh wanted to be with me despite everything. It was a very rewarding feeling. Then, I got sick again in February 2019. This is when I lost my sponsor because the doctors I was working with for my chronic pancreatitis decided to do a ketamine infusion and try me on Subutex. The pain was beyond my control and we were looking for alternates to full antagonistic opiates. I called my sponsor after everything happened at the hospital. I let her know that I went through a Ketamine infusion and got put on Subutex. Well, roughly a month later she dumped me over a text as a sponsee. I was devastated.

Very devastated. I cried about it for two weeks. Josh worried immensely about me. Soon enough though I got ""over it"" so to speak and carried on. I am still scarred from that event but, I knew I needed to change my life. For me, the Subutex had given me some freedom. I was no longer practically bedridden. I was able to go out and get things done, and live a bit of a life. Something, that used to take immense amounts of energy to do. Even going out to a meeting would require less activity the day and/or a nap prior to February 2019.

So, yea, it's ""using"" but I've dug deep into research NA's official policy is if maintenance drugs are used to treat a medical condition other than addiction, and so long as it's not abused, it counts as being clean. Therefore, I still count myself clean. Especially because I've never done better. 

Remember that friend who I gave that good job reference to? And the fact that I moved near friends? Well the friend who I gave the job reference to, let's call her Kristy, well Kristy got me a job in accounts payable at a large building roughly 45 minutes away from me. Now, I don't drive so, normally that would be one very expensive UBER ride, but lo&behold another friend that we had moved closer to, worked in the same building at a different company. With her help, I accepted the job offer and started work.

I have now started getting back in touch with my NA friends, I've adjusted to working, my stress is way less and I'm happier overall. I couldn't ask for more. Plus, I'm starting to get excited about planning my Wedding and getting married clean.

That is what has gotten me to 6 months clean as of April 12th, 2019. It's amazing how so many pieces of my life came together. Getting a boyfriend, moving in with him out of the parent's, becoming stronger and more energetic, getting a job and living life the way it's meant to be lived: With Faith, Hope, & Love. 

Now all I need is a new sponsor :-).",1555041433.0
