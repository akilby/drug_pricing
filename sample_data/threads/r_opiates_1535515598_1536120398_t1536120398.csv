9d2ihn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9d2ihn/vent/,6,https://redd.it/9d2ihn,DeadbeatPieceOfShit6,Vent.,"My names Matt I’m 20 years old. I’m about to kill my self. This is my throw away. I’m somewhat well known on here on my main account. I post this here because you guys are some of the kindest, wisest, purest and funniest human beings I’ve ever had the joy to get to know over the years. If I go through with it, thank you all. 

I can’t take this anymore. Been sober for 4 days, not out of choice, everyone’s dry. 

It’s a fucked up thing when you need chemicals in your blood to feel like a human. 

Anyway, i think this is my last night on earth. Imma bout to pop 15 bars and wash them down with a handle. 

When I’m sober I realize how fucked I am. I was sexually abused everyday for 3 years by my older brother, and that shit has cost me.  I suffer from horrible mental illness. CPTSD, MDD, OCD. I can’t look anyone in the eye, I’m socially retarded, I can’t talk to  anyone. I don’t think I’ve made a true connection with anyone new in half a decade. 

I just want to feel like a normal ass 20 year old kid. But that shit isn’t going to happen, I’m never going to feel normal with all this trauma and mental illness and that’s a hard pill to swallow. 

I’m trying to better myself, and go to school and shit but my retarded ass is already flunking out. 

I lost my girl of 5 years to this shit. She couldn’t take being with my drug addict mentally ill ass anymore. She was my best friend and I miss her so much. 

This world is so fucked, she was raped a few years ago and I wasn’t there to protect her. I truly fucking hate every fiber of my being. The fact someone could do that to such a beautiful sweet girl truly makes me lose my faith in humanity. Nothing here but garbage. 

Last year we went to steamboat for New Years. We went to the hot springs, drank wine, bought her a nice dinner and watched the fire works and cuddled lovingly all night. I’m fine with that being the best night of my life. 

I’m sorry.

Had to pop a perc just now cuz feeling so awkwarded.

So, today, I feel super weird. I saw a family friend today that I had hung out with among the rest of the fam. this past sunday and my heart almost jumped. I was sweating the whole time he was sitting around and had this really bad headache. The weird thing is we did absolutely nothing that would be a reason as to why I would feel like this. We just literally hung out together. The whole fam. was together. It's like the feeling you get when you ""fuck"" someone and you are ashamed of it and then you see the person. You get all cringe, and socially withdrawn and don't wanna see the person, talk to them, or be around them or even THINK about them. That is EXACTLY what I would say that feeling is like. Except we did nothing sexual or remotely intimate. He is married, and has a kid. He is 12 years older than me wtf...he is like 12 years younger than my dad and my dad is 49 (BRAG INC: Im 25 yrs old - 5 ft 7, 145 lbs and athletic body - got a 4 pack lol - listen, im not gonna sugarcoat and humble brag, i say it like it is, and i wanted to say that so yea). What the actual fuck. Why do I feel this way around him. He is just a regular normal chill dude. Why is every part of my body and mind telling me he is weird to be around.

Ugh. So fucking frustrating.

Had my appt. with my HIV specialist today.  Told her about my night sweats, headaches, bone aches, nose bleed (first time in years I had a nose bleed last night around 4 am) and heart palpitations. She isn't too too worried but we repeated blood work today just in case. She said the nose bleeding would be due to four things, either my liver, a subarachnoid hemorrhage or lesions in the nose or dryness the nose with a history of snoring. She said that my previous liver results show it isn't the liver but TODAY, once my bloodwork repeated and uploaded, my total and direct bilirubin are abnormally high, as well as my glucose (fasting). Also, the trend for my usual blood work is not looking good.

My meds are:

**Genvoya** once per day (been on it for 1.5 years now), **Concerta** 36 mg B.I.D (first dose at 6 am, second at 12 noon) - been on it for almost 6 years now, **Percocet** (5/325) B.I.D PRN with 20 tabs refilled every 28 days, and my **Prozac** (20 mg) once per day (which is the first time ive mentioned it on reddit because i feel like everyone rolls their eyes at people who take it). I have been taking Prozac for 5 years.

BLOODWORK FROM TODAY: [https://imgur.com/a/kbXYAHS](https://imgur.com/a/kbXYAHS)

I have some theories at what could be happening.

A flare up of serotonin syndrome due to Prozac with Oxycodone and Prozac with Concerta. Prozac with Oxycodone is especially NOT a good thing to mix, with respect to how it affects the CYP2D6 enzyme. This leads to higher plasma concentrations of oxycodone, making it have a stronger effect ( fluoxetine oral will increase the level or effect of oxycodone oral by affecting hepatic enzyme CYP2D6 metabolism. Opioids may enhance the serotonergic effects of SSRIs and increase risk for serotonergic syndrome - [https://www.rxlist.com/drug-interactions/fluoxetine-oral-and-oxycodone-oral-interaction.htm](https://www.rxlist.com/drug-interactions/fluoxetine-oral-and-oxycodone-oral-interaction.htm)

This is further exacerbated with Cobicistat (found in genvoya) which is a pharmocokinetic enhancer (increases levels of many drugs in plasma indirectly). See: [http://www.hivclinic.ca/main/drugs\_interact\_files/narc-int.pdf](http://www.hivclinic.ca/main/drugs_interact_files/narc-int.pdf) page 12 (bottom right). So basically a 5 mg oxycodone for me hits me hard. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, HEART ISSUES. I know that SSRI's like fluoxetine with opioids like oxycodone can cause a form of heart arrhythmia and the fact that I have heart palpitations and sometimes struggle hard to take a satisfying breath is indicative it could be from the Prozac with the oxycodone. Pr**ozac with Oxycodone could also cause Torsades des pointes (thank you @PlatinumTower for enlightening me about this when you responded to someone else asking about methadone/oxycodone with an ssri)**

**My fun personality sees that as awesome, my intelligent side sees that as highly dangerous.**

Ive been on the prozac and concerta mix for a long time though, it's literally like snorting coke. No lie. They each enhance the effects of the other. Literature (see: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829342/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829342/) and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139175/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139175/) and [https://journals.lww.com/psychopharmacology/Abstract/1997/12000/Replacement\_Medication\_for\_Cocaine\_Dependence\_.8.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/psychopharmacology/Abstract/1997/12000/Replacement_Medication_for_Cocaine_Dependence_.8.aspx) )

I was an addict when I was 18 due to needing drugs to cope with being basically ""forced"" to fuck guys for money for a couple (YES, a COUPLE - FEMALE AND MALE WERE PIMPING ME OUT). They gave me 50 % cut though and I think thats what kept me with them for 2 years until cops raided the place. It was in St. Clair (downtown toronto).

I did EVERYTHING on the spectrum, from H to coke to K (K all the way) to MDMA (hated it tho) to Crystal Meth (hated the comedowns, my friend wouldnt let me smoke tina again after a party session once cuz I was beyond suicidal). All the way till I was 21.

Anyways, I dont even know why im rambling on. I went on a fucking tangent but this felt so good.

fuck i feel great rn.

Let's be friends.

P.S: Im starting school tomorrow.

Hello guys, i have pretty high opiate tolerance to my own estimation, but i have a anxious mind so i cant help asking this.

Sorry if the forums spirit is more recovery thing, i'm a kratom user myself and just the last 2 weeks i havent had access to it as its illegal in my country (but more should arrive by mail tomorrow) so ive been using different opiates, and i dont like them as much as kratom so im lookin foward to be back on it soon

so here it goes

I took around 10 mg methadone today at 19:00 (yesterday around 20mg, the last week every other day varying 20 or 7mg methadone and mixed in oxys and heroin couple of days) and at 00:00 i took around 30mg oxycontin crushed (snorted around half) . Im now reading scrary threads about methadones high risk of respiratory depression.

Im not especially sedated or anything just bit energetic anxious and kinda chill (fucking oxy ruined the methadon gave some anxious energy)

Should i worry for respiratory depression when i go to sleep? I feel like i have some , but not much when im awake but i fear if i go to sleep it could go worse.

Do you guys have any idea about how long methadone affects respiration ? analgesic effect is around 4-8 and all sources say the respiratory depressive effect peak comes later and lasts longer , but theres no actual hours, so i cant decide when it is safe to go to sleep.

Ås said, im not really sedated at all (which tells of my tolerance) neither yesterday from the 20mg methadon, only energetic.

Can u guys tell me if it should be ok to go to sleep at 6 am? Or should i stay up all night? Åny estimates of the lenght of the respiratory depression?

We can call this more addict behaviour than proper methadone therapy (obviously) so i wouldnt want to consult a doctor at 3 am as i dont have any history of substance abuse and dont want the problems it would cause..

Point is ive done this before with similar doses and didnt die so should i just trust my tolerance? Methadone accumulation is one thing that worries me but as you see from my description i have good tolerance so i dont think the accumulation would be that toxic in this short period yet?

I dont feel sedated at all either, isnt fatal respiratory depression usually with other symptoms also of opioid toxicity?

Now, since I began taking it again, I started taking the 1-2mg every day, because while off the Subs, I started having absolutely horrific insomnia (I'd often go without sleep for 40+ hours, and when I finally did sleep, it was maybe only 3-5 hours)-- so I'm taking them every day now to help me sleep.

Unfortunately, as mentioned above, now that I'm taking them every day I'm unable to achieve orgasm. I have no problems with my sex drive, I just can't orgasm no matter how hard I try.

Thought I might share it with people going through the same struggle.

Y'all have a wonderful day keep being strong.

 

I need to write out that letter for you who has been a part of my life for almost 6 years now. The first time we met, I had heard things about you. Some people said you were beautiful but hurtful, caring but manipulative, you were holding everything and its contrary. But no matter how many times you were getting called out, it wasn't fear you were making me feel. I was fascinated, I believed in myself enough to think I could experience your beauty while handling your madness. 

Our first exchange was at the time the best moment I had ever lived. Nothing existed anymore, it was just you and me against the entire world. Anywhere I could ever be would feel like the most comfortable spot as long as I was with you. You remember that public bathroom? It was pretty far from romantic I’ll admit, but just the two of us we couldn't be happier. Hiding from the world was also part of the thrill, you were an outlaw with blood on your hands, I didn't plan on ever telling my family about you. I didn't really care about how long it would last, I was just hoping to get something out of our relationship. I guess I was looking for something. As a kid I always dreamed of being above other people's opinions and life obstacles, and I found out spending time with you was helping me with that. I had more and more problems up my ass everyday because of you but I didn't give a damn about them, because of you. 

Came the day I was the most scared of, the day you got blood on your hands again, but this time you'd chosen someone I loved as much as you. We broke up for a while, I wanted to try on reconciling with life after all the shit you'd been throwing at my face for the last couple months. I eventually did, but something was still missing. I was doing great on my own, I had made new friends, a good life was opening its door for me. Maybe I was doing too good, so good that I started talking to some of your friends again. They wouldn't stop reminding me of how good you were, bad memories slowly fading away. At that time I thought you and me needed to have one last talk, just one, so I could get my head around what our story meant. I found you in less than a day, you came to me so easily, like it was the one thing you were waiting for. How dumb could I be to think it would all go well, the addiction started all over again. I couldn't spend twenty-four hours without thinking of you, I needed you, at every second of every day. I believe those few weeks were the ones we’ve been the closest, and that was one hell of a crazy ride. I loved you too much, when I was forced to stay away from you I would sweat, get anxiety, tears in my eye, and believe the sky was going to fall on me. Those things were putting me at risk regarding our secret, I knew that if we kept on being that careless we would lose absolutely everything we had. I didn't want to lose you, I just wanted you to stay away for a little while. Which you did, mostly because we knew we would get together again someday. It ended up happening like we said it would, you came back. How am I supposed to live without you, all these years you’ve been there allowing me to bear everything around. You occupy so much room in my mind, telling me sweet words but I know what they hiding. I know. That's the problem, I know you're no good to me, I know I would waste my life away if I stayed with you. I know. So why am I here again searching for a vein?

Been lurking this sub for a while as I got interested in opiates. I know this is a slippery slope etc but please I am only interested about harm reduction.
So I've got this brown H powder (0.13g) from the deep web and if I believe the reviews it seems pretty strong.
So for the sake of it lets assume its pure, and I have no scale. I did a test with a tiny flake (insuflated, i dont want to smoke it/IV) withtout any effect.
How should I go about actually dosing ? Is a small key bump alright or too much with (lets assume for hr) pure heroin ?
In the case where there is fent hotspot (im in europe but I read it happened) how can I ""even"" it in the bag I have and dont die from it ?
Only opiate I used before was codeine very infrequently, last time was mast week and I ate a box of 28 30mg over 3 days.

Since Afghanistan has been completely occupied by the US and other countries military,  why did Our troops just eradicate every poppy farm in the country as they were patrolling it for the past 18 years?? 🤔🧐",1536065888.0

i've always been curious whether that could be worked into the current harm reduction best practices, to have a Narcan cartridge within arm's reach whenever you inject by yourself. i know it's probably rare that anyone would remain conscious long enough to administer it or even to figure out that they were in trouble in the first place...but i ask because during my OD, i actually remained conscious and more or less lucid for at least a full minute before blacking out. it's hard to say for sure what i would've been capable of in that moment, whether i would have been able to identify the onset of an OD (i'd think now that it's happened once i'd be more apt to recognize it if it happened again, but idk) or whether i'd be able to make any cause/effect connections between the presence of the Narcan and the fact that i needed it...just something that occurred to me because so many fatal ODs take place when the person is using by themselves.

there is this seemingly relevant paper on ""[two patients who self-administered Narcan to treat their own overdoses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24821348/),"" but when you read the abstract it's actually just talking about people who had previously given instructions to another individual on how to use the naloxone, and the individuals were then able to successfully administer it. i wonder if there are any recorded instances of someone actually managing to do it themselves before losing consciousness.",1536045779.0

Outside of the meeting we gather around an old bench and two coffee cans on the ground.

They are half filled with gravel. Once soggy cigarette butts sit smashed and brown on top of the rocks inside of them. We puff on our smokes. I am down to four cigarettes a day. One before work. One at lunch. One after the meeting. One before bed, but on the weekends, I smoke more. There’s just not as much to do.

Some of us sit. Some of us stand with our backs to the red brick wall of the church’s covered walkway. Jerry chugs sugar free Red Bull from a tall silver can in the dark. He turns to me and speaks. His breath is combustible and chemically sweetened, fed by fumes of the artificial poisons bubbling in his guts.

“So, it’s been a journey, man. I’m just stoked to see it all.” An image of the neighbor girl’s white breasts jiggling on the living room rug and her shaking the orange bottle of pills like a maraca flashes in my head. Then, it is Sal limping off the Sounder earlier that morning saying he will see me tomorrow with a dub of fire. Number four. And the Junky Vonnegut is getting some for free.

Jerry pulls hard on his on his cigarette. His cheeks collapse around his teeth. The cherry ember glows orange and lights his face. He continues, but now, he speaks words made of smoke.

“Two years is an amazing feat, dude. Really, not many get there if you consider all the people who have ever tried to get sober. Almost none. Be proud of yourself.”

“Thanks. I am,” proud of what? I’m not sure. I just know it’s the right response.

“Call me tomorrow.”

“Why? Won’t you be here?”

“Nah. I got some work to take care of. Won’t be off in time for the meeting.” Jerry says.

“Okay. See ya.” He walks off.

Another guy I know from the meeting taps me on the shoulder. He says he has tickets for a Mariner’s game next weekend and wants to know if I’d be interested in going. I tell him yes. We exchange numbers and walk our separate ways.",1536040637.0

I will do this until the water is cloudy as apposed to brown/amber. I have noticed that when I filter I get a much more sedating buzz, and my cotton never washes 100% white, it's always stained brown which leads me to believe that I am potentially filtering  out coffee particles as when I do ""raw"" plugs I have issues getting to sleep/nodding. 


I am curious if anyone else who plugs filters/ rinses their cotton until they only pull cloudy solution from their filter; if so do they also think filtering adds a better buzz and do you also feel like you are wasting product if the filter is dripping brown/ tan liquid instead of clear water.

She decided she wanted to do cold turkey at her dad's house, but because of his felon status there were a lot of restrictions (they didn't want us to talk, they searched her shit, I'm not allowed in his house, etc). I was going to my dad's to do a sub taper. 

The first day was pretty fucking awful for both of us. We woke up to get news that our cat had died. While she wasn't supposed to see me, they brought her over for a ""memorial service"". Her grandma has hated me since the second time I met her, and she came to town for her detox. At the ""service"" my divorcing parents got into an argument, and grandma takes my mom's side (FYI she cheated on my dad after like 25 years and hid it for an extra year, then treated my dad like shit after his suicide attempt), and with knowing she hates me, and now she's against him, he went off. As everyone was leaving he kept calling her a witch (was fucking hilarious, I had to hide so she didn't see me laughing).

After that, I went inside, still not feeling too bad, didn't take a sub that day. Next day, woke up miserable, took half of the sub..... nothing. A few hours later took the other half, also nothing, we had it open for a few months. Sick as fuck, I managed to put a deal together so I could buy another sub. Waited til today at 1, felt pretty good most of the day, til about 2 hours ago I feel sick again. 

My fiance made it to today with nothing, she says she's feeling a little better, but she couldn't deal with the restrictions (mostly the no weed part). She texted me today, she wanted to leave, now we're together and everything seems easier. I'm still in some pain, that's the point of the taper. I just didn't expect to be this sick so more subs would probably be the solution, but I'm working with what I have.

Sorry for the wall of text, just don't have a lot of people to talk to about this, not having struggles wanting to use, just want to feel better, not high, just tolerable, that's what the sub did for a while, about 6 hours, now I'm sick again and can't take more subs til tomorrow.

Technically wouldn’t that be safe Heroin, because it’s Diamorphine pure and hospitals use morphine on patients. I’ve also heard that Heroin use to be used for patients in different countries, hospitals were using it. They now have safe injection sites with medical grade Heroin. So basically, what I’m saying is “IF” YOU could control the dosage you take every time and stick to it then you would never OD and die right??? Just don’t take huge amounts go up very slow then take a break have weed and dabs on deck for a withdrawl let the tolerance low a bit and start up again...

Fall is coming.

Early morning faces stare into cell phone screens like magical handheld portals. Many wear still wet hair and smell of toothpaste. Some carry briefcases or bookbags. One boy sings along with whatever is playing in his headphones, and another smells of cheap aerosol cologne. A young mother addresses her small children wearing their school uniforms. We wobble along the tracks. There is the digital recording of a woman’s voice letting us know which station is next. The brakes let out their empty metal howl, and we float forward in our seats. We fall back into them. Sometimes, I look up to see who is getting on and who is getting off. Mostly, I read.

20 minutes before it is my turn to get off the train, someone is standing over me. I ignore the shadow, hoping to find a better place to let off reading in the book. A familiar voice gargles through a thin film of phlegm above me. The words are warm.

“Well, if it ain’t the Junky Vonnegut.”

Only one person calls me that. My friend Sal.

“Well, if it ain’t old Salamander Sal come to terrorize the masses this morning. How’re ya doing?” I’m the only one who has ever called him Salamander.

“Are you really reading that again?”

“Yeah. I am. Look.” I hold the book out so that he can read the reviews on the cover. “It says he very nearly levitates. Don’t you think that might be worth reading once or twice?”

“Whatever man. You’re crazy.” He shakes his head. “It’s good you like it. I just ain’t ever liked a book that much.” Sal flashes a smile to reveal the kinds of gaps between his teeth that I associate with a certain brand of Latin American masculinity. I’m not sure where I ever got that idea. But, there it is.

“Yup. Yup. And where’ve ya been? Ain’t seen ya at any meetings lately.”

“Dee Dee. Man. Said she was tired of that meeting at the church. Said it’s too sad and depressing. Too many old people. Said it’s time to find a different one.” The last time I saw her was at a meeting. She spent the whole hour trying to open a bag of Sour Patch Kids. It was difficult for her to do. She kept falling asleep while she was standing up.

“Where you go now?”

“I don’t know. Haven’t been in a minute.”

“Oh, no!”

“Yeah.” He laughs. “And how you doing?”

“Good.” Memories of the last two weekends at the neighbor’s apartment with her grandmother’s bottle of Xanax make an unwanted appearance in my mind. “Yeah. I’m doing good, man. On the suboxone program.”

“Cool. How long? You been on subs since rehab?”

“Yeah. Coming up on two years here soon.”

“Has it been that long?”

“Two years for me in two weeks and a day.”

“Wow. That’s awesome, bro. I’m proud of you. Done better than me.”

“Yeah.” I shrug and shake my head.

“So you ain’t messing around then, huh?”

I stare at his arm. The world and sounds around me fade. There are gnarled knots of chicken bone gristle and tendrils of scar tissue holding him together inside. Under his clothes the unsightly webs of paper bag flesh cover half of his body. Part of my mind wanders back to the memory of Sal sitting across from me in the small air conditioned office with six other men while he stared down and recounted the night he turned 21. Our beady eyed counselor held his clipboard and nodded his head. Sal told us about losing his scholarship to play college baseball. He told us how his girlfriend lost her life. We all saw the reptilian skin grafts when he got out the shower at night, but now, he sees me looking at his mangled wrist and hand. He quietly moves his arm back behind himself.

“What?” I look up at him.

“You ain’t messing around then?” Sal asks again.

“Nah.” I don’t mean to say anything else, but the second part is a slip. “Not really.”

“Not really? Or yeah, you are? Cuz last I checked, not really means yeah.” Sal smiles.

“I’m not getting high.” That is the truth. Two weekends on Xanax is not something I plan to continue, even if it has ruined my sobriety date. I’m not doing heroin. I’m not getting high.

“Too bad.”

“What?”

“I said that that is too bad, man.”

“Too bad what?”

“You won’t get to try this fire.” Sal’s never been a junky. His vices are women and alcohol.

“Fire?”

“Yeah. You know I won’t mess with it. I just need someone to tell me if it is as good as it’s supposed to be.”

“What’s it supposed to be?”

“Number four.”

“Number four like the movies?”

“Yessir.”

“Man. No way you’re getting real number four. You know these streets. We're on the west coast. It’s all black out here.”

“Seen a stamped kilo, man, at my boy’s place just last night. White powder. Vietnamese cats.”

“White powder?” I take a moment to think on it. “Well, what about Dee Dee?”

“Dee Dee? Man, you know I love her. I don’t need her any crazier than she is already. Bro, she’s a junky worse than you.”

I stick my thumb in my chest. “I’m not a junky.”

We both laugh at that.

“Seriously, though, Sal. I’m not using. It ain’t like that.”

“You’re on subs.”

“So?”

“So. You wake up everyday and run to that medicine cabinet and take that pill, just like you used to wake up everyday and call your dude for your fix. Same thing. Besides. Last I heard, the sub program runs a pretty penny.”

I had nothing to say. Without the state insurance I got from living on the street and going to rehab as an indigent, I couldn’t afford it. Still, my life is way better on subs than it ever was on heroin.

“What you say, man? You wanna try some of that good good?”

“Maybe.” I slump again in my seat. He catches my smirk.

“Yeah.” Sal nods, excited. “Yeah. You do.”

We sit in silence. Another station is announced. The train stops. People get off. People get on. He waits for me to ask him or volunteer myself for the experiment. Minutes pass.

“Look, man, tell ya what.” He lowers his voice. “You gonna be on the train tomorrow?”

“Yeah.”

“Then, I’m a throw you a dub of that fire for free.”

“You know what they say, Sal. The first one’s always free.” I refuse eye contact with him.

“This one is. But, it can be your last too. You ain’t gotta be a junky.”

“Sure.” I shake my head.

The voice announces the next station over the speakers.

“This is my stop.” He limps toward the doors. He descends the stairs and looks back. “Don’t forget, Junky Vonnegut! Tomorrow. Same train. Same time.” Like I would forget. 

Through the window, hushed halos of copper light hang over the passing neighborhood streets. They sit silent in the shade or see the soft steps of family members dispersing for the day. Forrest fire smoke pollutes the air from other states, and the distant silver dollar sun wears an orange wreath hovering on the horizon. It is warm on my face. Soon, that incandescent orb will be sitting in places and lighting the sky in ways that make me anxious. Soon, the dog days will be a memory I long for, lost inside of me somewhere.",1536004749.0

We all know the difference between getting well and getting a fix. Jails keep killing addicts. I think it's cruel to let someone go through an opiate withdrawal. Methadone and suboxone need to be much more available and we must work to end the stigma and change what is commonly known about opiates. If not just so we have a chance but everyone else too. Ill let you know if I use your story. There are many facets of withdrawal I'll be focusing on. I'm trying to put the whole story together in many people's words. Maybe you sweat more than other people, maybe your a puker, shitter, or have seizures. I'm going over every agonizing detail. Tnx! ",1536000535.0

I am musing about this and I need some advice

In short:
I know that an ultra low dose of naltrexone together with an opiodergic increase the effects and prevents tolerance from forming

Also, I am not sure if taking a low dose (1 mg) just before bed could lower the tolerance to opiodergics per se

So, my idea would be this:
Would taking an ULDN together with every kratom consumption AND a LDN at night (1mg), not less than 6 hrs after last K. dose, just before bedtime, make sense and be viable to keep my tolerance down **without** precipitating me in a withdrawal-like state during sleep and/or preventing my day-after K. dose to exert effect??

[I already take sublingual agmatine with every K. consumption]

Thank you",1535997891.0

Its a great way to stay connected with the community without putting myself back into a compromising position of scoring from old friends or meeting up with dealers. Addicts get a bad rep and are viewed poorly by society but some of the nicest people i’ve met in life are addicts. Yes we have an addiction and sometimes we do shitty things but deep down we are good people(most of us are at least). 

Overall I’m feeling a lot better, almost 100% physically, but the mental game is still tough, i still get anxiety and cravings often but they are becoming a lot less frequent each day. Im slowly gaining my confidence back, I’m going to therapy to work on some issues that my have caused my drug use and am learning to cope sober. All and all things are looking pretty good.

Since I first got into them on Friday I've had a worsening physical reaction which i believe is related:

I've been unbearably itchy (even more so than I usually am on opiates), 

The upper half of my body feels warm yet it is not particularly warm to the touch,

My face around my eyes is red, irritated and feels like its on fire (It almost looks like I have Lupus),

And My face, head, chest and back have been sweating uncontrollably, my T shirt was wet through earlier.


These symptoms were initially not so bad, so thinking it was a passing thing I continued to dose and it has gotten more intense, causing me to believe it is related to the dope.


I've had the itching and irritation around my face/eyes before, but never this bad and I have never experienced the uncontrollable. sweating before.


So I come to you guys... Does anyone have an idea of what it might be?  

A histamine reaction?  An allergy to heroin or to a cut?
I've just taken 50mgs of Promethazine which I am hoping will provide some relief.

I've had pure fent before and that was damn close to it barring potency. However, in the background I swear I could feel the actual heroin lingering a few hours later. I certainly didn't get enough actual heroin in me to get a decent nod.

Opiates have never really been my cup of tea, but somewhat recently I had a nice tramadol bender that helped me realize I just haven't been using high enough doses.

Blot away any pus or liquid draining from the abscess with a clean tissue or bandage. Avoid direct contact between your skin and the fingers blotting away the liquid. Throw away the bandage immediately and don’t reuse it.Always wash your hands before and after you tend to your abscess so you don't spread an infection. Dangerous infections like MRSA can spread.

Apply warm compresses to the abscess. Wash your hands with soap and water. Heat a cup of water so that it’s warm to hot and won’t burn your skin. Dip a clean bandage or soft cloth water and place it on the abscess and skin around it. Applying warm or hot compresses can help drain your abscess and reduce your pain and discomfort.Apply the compresses several times a day.Rub the abscess with the cloth in a gentle circular motion, which can release pus from it. Seeing a little blood when you do this is normal.

Soak in a lukewarm bath. Fill your bathtub or small container with lukewarm water. Then soak your body in the tub or the abscess in the water for 10-15 minutes. Soaking may help the abscess drain naturally and minimize your pain and discomfort. Clean the tub or small container thoroughly before and after you use it.Consider sprinkling the water with baking soda, uncooked oatmeal or colloidal silver, or Epsom salt. These may calm your skin and help to drain the boil naturally.

Clean the abscess and surrounding skin. Wash the abscess with a mild antibacterial soap and clean, warm water. Make sure to clean any skin around the abscess, too. Dab your skin dry with a soft, clean towel.Wash the abscess with an antiseptic cleanser if you prefer to use something stronger than soap.Part of washing your abscess is showering or bathing daily. Maintaining good personal hygiene can heal the abscess and minimize the risk of further infections.

Cover the abscess with a sterile bandage. Once your abscess is clean, loosely place sterile gauze or a bandage over it. To prevent infection, change the bandage if the abscess drains through it or if the covering gets wet or dirty.

Use an over the counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Follow dosage instruction closely to relieve any pain and discomfort you have. Pain medications such as ibuprofen may also minimize swelling.

Wash items that make contact with your abscess. Set your washer to high water temperature. Place any clothing or linens or even the washcloth you use as a compress in it. Run the machine and then dry the items of high. This can wash away lingering bacteria that may further inflame or infect your abscess.

Wear loose and smooth clothing.Tight-fitting clothing can irritate your skin and make a boil worse. Wear loose, smooth, and light clothing so your skin can breathe and heal faster.Smooth textured clothing such as cotton or merino wool can keep your skin from getting irritated and can prevent excess sweating that may irritate the affected area.

Watch for signs of further infection.Continue self-care as long as your abscess is healing and doesn’t show signs that the infection is getting worse. Look for the following signs the abscess and infection are getting worse and seek immediate medical attention if Your skin is getting more red or more painful.There are red streaks running from the abscess and surrounding area towards your heart.The abscess and surrounding skin feels very warm or hot to the touch.Significant pus or other fluid is running from the abscess.You have a fever higher than 101.5 °F (38.6 °C).You have chills, nausea, vomiting, headache or muscle aches.",1535947008.0

Trust me I love them that’s why I’m on this sub and I love all of y’all and truly try to love everyone I can but I’ve been worn down by them. I’ve always been into drugs and started smoking weed everyday when I was about 11 (I’m in my mid twenties now). I also grew up with health issues so I had been on various “medications” since as long as I can remember. Last year things went way south in my life and even though I had dabbled in pills/syrup, I had never done real dope...I had morphine a few times IV in some hospitals but after things turned to shit finally from my best friend dying (not opiate related, just accident) my girlfriend at the time cheated on me and that relationship had fallen apart...then school finally fell apart when I got caught in a drug test and they decided to be harsh. ...I went overboard and one of my best friends had been fucking around with H, he told me of course it was just opium and tried to actually keep me from it...unfortunately he couldn’t keep himself from it which always leads to “what’s mine is yours brother” ...at least till we’re hooked on something ha but yeah he let me smoke and snort some with him...felt amazing. First time in years I felt the warmth of loving accepting blissfulness wash over me and when I would exhale it was truly one of the most relaxing sensations I’d ever felt. Sure enough I got hooked and then had to go home and leave that friend who I had been scoring with. The next couple months were fucked up...started raiding the family medicine cabinets...started finding other ways to score/meeting sketch people in sketchy places...all right around that time I also started having a lot of old friends back home od on fent laced stuff so my anxiety was always heightened when I was scoring unless I saw it come straight from a script. That was when the depression kicked in and I started feeling really tired. I don’t want to bitch and complain so I’ll stick with just trying to tell my story so others can maybe relate for whatever reasons... I tried to overcome all the depression partially from using lots of different substances (not just opiates but also hallucinogenics, stimulants, benzo’s, and pretty much anything I could get my hands on). I got school back going again last week and have held down a steady job for the last 7 years at least. I tapered myself down with my pills and lost most all of my connects. Met a new girl not that long ago that started helping me care about myself again and insisted I cut out doing all the “hard” shit (she doesn’t care if I smoke/consume weed and trip every once in a blue moon) but she doesn’t like me doing opiates/white/pills. Honestly her discouragement has helped get me where I’m at but these cravings are fucked and terrible. My thoughts race and go slow at different times. My mood swings and I physically ache and feel like shit overall. Got a knarly head and stomach ache and chills/sweats to match. Got through the worst of it I felt like over the last 3 days (today is day 4) but still feel just bad. Luckily I can throw myself into school these next few days but it won’t be easy, I don’t expect it to be but just damn...I can’t let some of my family know I’ve been battling with addiction because it would literally tear them apart... I just have to push forward and get through these next few weeks, then months...I used to go to NA meetings, my Dad is also an addict of course so I grew up around the “groups/rooms”. Might start back going to them regularly, already checked out some student recovery groups that look really awesome, truly. This is where these specific drugs potentially can lead you. They’re not necessarily bad drugs; I understand in the treatment of chronic pain opiates can truly be lifesavers actually, I get that first hand...just I also know how it feels to finish your third script and wonder where/how you’re going to get relief in the meantime before seeing your doctor. I get all of it, truly. And it makes you tired when you get all of it. Shit post I guess and like I said I’ll probably just remove it anyways but if anybody feels this pain, anxiety, and depression as well then my heart truly goes out to you and this ones for you.

You will bff needles eventually and likely,"So use new ones. Use the thinnest tip, the shortest tips, the tiniest puncturing implement possible.

Years of use will pass before registering battles you. But you're smart so you slay your enemy by using longer inch tips to reach through scar tissue to tap a whole new level of veins.

Then those destroy all your roads quicker as they're wider forcing strategic retreat, back to 5/16 inch comfort, ak 47 comfort that Rwandan rebels feel.  You hit hands, feet, ankles, fingers, toes, and sporadically any resurgent arm bulgers.


Years..... Then a day comes. You can try longer tips if they've recovered if you're lucky...

It's raining tho. You're already late for work. Shoes on, nose dripping. You could get down to business if you could just hit.

But you can't. Frustration and blood clots block the day starting.

So the pads of your feet, the,neck, the palm, under the triceps.... All places with successful shot percentages less than 50%....


But you finally hit the gesyser and that crimson ploom makes you shake from giddiness... You thank god and speed to work ready to annihilate any task put in front of you....

This is possible because you read my post decades prior.  You're thankful you even have those measly, uncooperative spots left to shoot.  If you hadn't kept up on your vein health, you'd be sick and still poking scar tissue now.

So you work all day high as a kite still injecting the only joy from this world. And you're thankful. That iced tea lunatic sure cared about people's circulatory system.


You then remember why I care. Because I'm out of fuck ing veins to hit!!!!!! Argggghhhhhh seriously take care of your shit!!! I have to quit because snorting is useless and missing every shot is pointless.

With that being said, I’ve got what I believe to be quite an interesting story. So I have been an opiate addict for 10 years (since I was 17) Make that 11 years because I turned 28 yesterday. My opiate of choice was old school OC 80 in the beginning then when they stopped making those Sept. 1, 2011 (my birthday) I switched to stop sign opanas (irregular to locate) and the ever present oxycodone 30 mg. Because of life there was a few periods of sobriety peppered throughout 2011-2018. But for the most part, probably 90-95% of 2008-2018 I was in active addiction. My addiction came to a head when I relocated to an area where the opiate flow like milk and honey. Baltimore. Here is where I finally found a consistent supply of my favorite - Opana. At this time the opanas were no longer stop signs, they were the G74 Orange panda bears. Over the next few years my addiction progressed to the point where I needed 200 mg of Opana to just sustain. Very, very expensive. Introduced to H and IV and what was somewhat manageable for 10 years quickly became unmanageable within a couple of months. Long story short, I finally put together some time off of opiates (longer than a rehab stint) I have been clean from opiates (other than a pretty gnarly kratom habit) for close to a year. 2 weeks ago I reintroduced myself to the beast and have been IVing H for exactly 2 weeks. My question is if I were to stop right this instant do you think I will withdrawal? Secondly, I have a wash for tomorrow.. what’s the best way to store it? ",1535916080.0

She wanted to go play pool last night and have a drink and i told her i was in too much pain, she was like i dont have any more pills but i have these edibles i bought in colorado that are supposed to be great for pain. We had actually only met once before when she had given me the pills. I didnt havr a lot of hope that it would help much but i figured why not. The gummies were 20mg of thc but much higher in CBD as they were made for pain. I aye one, which eas delicious actually) and after an hour i took the other and it helped so much. Vetter than most pain meds i have taken and ive taken them all.  I hadnt smoked in 5 years so i had no tolerance but i was shocked. It took 80% of my pain and I slept like a baby. I wish iy eas legal in my state i wouldnt need nearly as much pain meds as i now take, if they really want to do somethi ng about the pain meds crisis a lot of people could just take these edibles instead of getting so strung out. Obviously we need both but i was shocked at how effective it was.  they need to legalize it, im in texas and i dont think they will anytime soon. Im going to make a trip to Colorado and stock up but any chronic pain patients out there should give it a try it helped so much and allowed me to eat and even get some sleep.  This woman who ive only met once in person was like an angel. Free dilaudid and edibles. I wish i was attracted to her, she even tried to suck me off last night but i said no. I like her too much as a person and didnt want to lead her on which was rough because i really needed that head lol but shes a sweetheart so now i have my pandas back and all is right in the world.  Treat people well and it usually comes back to you. Its great to have friends who legitimatley want to help you when youre down. So as im curious what are so me of the best edibles? Strains?

Junkie from a different monkey here (greetings from the Sun Gods of the Peruvian and Bolivian jungles!). I'm trying to compile accurate insights and helpful advice for a compendium of harm reduction information I was dispatched by a psychedelic union to produce, and I need some information that I cannot find too easily on the web because of all the fucking Malibu Barbie capitalist rehab sites that come up when I try to google substance use information. What is elusive to me is how heroin or opiate ODs play out — what their timeline is, how one can tell it’s an OD and not something else, what might help if Narcan isn’t on hand as you wait for an ambulance and what would definitely hurt, etc. The best information I could find were instructions for Narcan application, since they came from public health organizations and EMTs. Yet even these pages left me dissatisfied with how to handle an OD should I ever come across one or, I guess, experience one myself ( I fent test all my stuff, I swear I do), in that the instructions varied based on the kind of OD that presented (?), and that there was still a risk of a patient slipping back into OD (???) with some substances. Moreover, I was aggravated by the lack of good information to delineate between a person ""nodding"" out or copping a sickness-preventing buzz on the one hand, versus someone that is out cold in an a drug overdose, and who needs immediate help, on the other. To add to the confusion, a lot of the symptoms of a normal high and an OD seemed to overlap, a fact that triggered my anxiety disorder and panic — and I've been around enough cocaine and acid to know a panic attack on top of an OD or bad trip is absolutely not preferable if it's possible to not induce one, please and thank you, good samaritan. 

With other drugs, there usually is a threshold moment or peak of drug effect, and once you're on the comedown, you're most likely going to ride out an overdose alive if you indeed had one. But since opiates tend to be the ""slow drug"", how would one know if the normal high isn't going to cross over to a overdose? Doesn't one phase lead to another? Or — and this is my central question — is there a certain point along in the opiate high that you know you're more or less in the clear since you're over the peak of the drug? Certainly I am not interested in forgoing a 911 call, but it seems to me that getting more education about what is going on with someone believed to have used opiates benefits us all because you never know in America if your call for an ambulance maybe was not totally necessary to dispatch because assuredly someone nearby probably *is* ODing, and that was their ambulance you just called for your situation.  

All I know is I'd be totally useless to apply sound judgment based on the phenomena the sites instructed I observe, and so they probably should have just instructed a 911 call and left it at that, if that's the best they can offer (and ultimately, all sites say to do just that). I just haven't been around enough people I know to use or at least admit to using opiates to know this stuff, which is why I come here to your fine community’s absolutely-necessary online page to seek assistance in defining down what constitutes an overdose, if there is acute OD as well as chronic OD, what effect other drugs might have on an OD, when in the timeline of use ODs tend to occur (I *do* know relapsers are at greatest risk), if that’s different based on route of administration, if it’s possible to know you’re ODing, etc. 

If anyone can help me out here, it'd be great. If you need more stricture to know what I’m asking, I feel like it’s those timetables of when OD happens and when one is in the clear and just experiencing a come down or sleepy, nodding effects, and how these might be different for ROA and for length of binge.

Edit update: 12:30 am est

Hi everyone, thank you all for your kind words and help! So we made it out of there. After explaining I was not leaving my belongings in the apartment without a key (boss husband wanted me to leave my key and my furniture that I could not bring with me today still in the apartment) he got very aggressive and loud as he does. So what do I do? I call back my local PD who had already explained they cannot do that. I wish I could have seen the look on his face when the cop pulled up. Wasn't expecting it at all. So he puts on a one man show with every possible emotion all within an hours time and gets to go home looking like a complete lunatic to all those present for the show.

End result? I'm out, partner it out, we are safe and housed, my furniture is still in the apartment, but my key is in my pocket 👍

Okay so my favorite stamp right now is called White House/danger. Love it. Nice rush and nice legs. So after the first time I tasted the liquid my mouth was numb and when I missed a little of the shot my hand was numb. So after that I figured coke was in it. 

A while back my girlfriend failed a test at IOP that came up methadone/Suboxone. I didn’t think anything of it. Thought it was a false positive or mistake.  

Now the other week my friend came out of county jail on a Friday night. He only did this stamp. For some dumb reason he ends back up in county Saturday morning lol. 
They tested him and he said he failed for coke and methadone. 

So now I’m wondering if there is some synthetic fent that could test positive for methadone? Because I really doubt it’s methadone in this powder, but what do I know. 

Another friend failed a test for his IOP this last Thursday. He just failed for opiates on an 12 panel. So methadone would of came up. He also only has done this stamp.

An hour and a half later, they call “yo man sorry, I had car problems, I’m just leaving now so it’ll bew 30 mins there, 30 mins back.” You know that’s a lie. So you look at the clock, okay, so I’ll see you in an hour. “Yeah I’ll call you.” An hour and 45 mins later you call, no answer. 3 hours later....you get a text...”lm like 45 min away,” you get a little less anxious.

It was May 2017, I was supposed to be graduating High School, but I dropped out in December. I had the graduation trip paid off though, so they let me go anyways. I had developed a small Hydrocodone habit. I would take some norcos/vics once in a while, but I never ""nodded out"". I didn't even know that was a thing. I would take them for the euphoric, body relaxing ""high"". Started out taking 1, but by May I was taking 2 to achieve that high. Only $10 to get a good nights high.

Anyways, for the graduation trip, we were going on a cruise ship. 4 days stress free, on a boat, making a stop at catalina island & ensanada mexico, surrounded by people I considered friends for the past 4 years. I had been on a good amount of Carnival cruise ships already, so I knew everything. How to get shit on, how to get shit off, etc. 

I purchased 8 norcos for the trip, to have 4 highs. Put those in my backpack since I was gonna take 2 on the bus. I was packing my bags, putting the Rumrunners filled with Hennessy under my luggage to sneak on, and my carton of cigarettes on top. I was  listening to Earl Sweatshirt. ""Half a Xanax when i'm traveling 6 hours or more"" a lyric which I thought about. This bus ride would make me really anxious, being around all these chaperones  that already knew me as a troublemaker. I decided i'd buy a bar, but I would only take like .25-.5 mg of Alp. 

Did that. Packed up all my bags & everything was ready. Got dropped off where the bus picks us up at 4 AM. It was 3:30 so me and my boys walk to the donut shop for a quick snack, and to have one last cigarette. I was pissed, because the chaperones made it CLEAR there would be 0 stop the whole 7 hour trip, and I fucking love smoking cigarettes when i'm high. Whatever, i'd be okay. 30 minutes pass, were situated on the bus, starting to leave.

Everyones seated, I cut the bar in half & split it with my friend. I have a low benzo tolerance, so I knew 0.5mg would chill me out. Then, I decide fuck it... I want a good Norco high on this trip, so I double my ""dose"" and pop 4 10mg norcos. 40mg Hydrocodone. Was ready for this euphoric trip with my homie right next to me.

15 minutes pass. I feel less anxious and more relaxed, definitely the Xan. 30 minutes pass, I feel the Hydrocodone start to come on. But holy shit, this time it feels stronger. Did I take too much? Am I going to OD? I was so dumb. But I calm myself out and sit back. I feel euphoric as fuck, I turn on ""Drugs you should try it"" by Travis Scott in my headphones, and sit back. I start nodding out, for the first time. There's no ""real"" way to describe nodding for the first time, but holy shit.... I felt perfect. I could barely keep my eyes open, my body felt like it was floating on a cloud. I looked at my friends across from me, who were chowing on a edible, and we dap eachother up. 

I was enjoying the fuck out of this high, for like an hour. Listening to my playlist with my boy next to me. Driving on the freeway while it's pitch black, most of the people in the bus sleeping. It was just really nice. No stress. Nodding out and fiending for a stoge. Holy shit it was fucking amazing. After like an hour & a half, I fall asleep...

... Then I was awaken by a friend shaking me. I figure I slept the whole way, but I didn't. We were ahead of schedule, so we made a stop at a rest stop after all. I was still high as fuck since it was only like 3 hours, so I jump out and spark up a stoge. Boom. The cigarette enhanced the FUCK out of it. Im sitting there, nodding with a stoge in my hand. This was a new feeling to me, but I fucking loved it. This was the high I was gonna chase after for now on. Chaperones walked past us smoking cigarettes, giving us a dirty look, but I was too happy to give a fuck. Everything seriously felt perfect for a second. Fuck stressing about  the usual shit I was stressing about back home, I was in heaven. I loved it.

When the bus took off, I enjoyed the last of the high for like 30 minutes then passed out again, and woke up at the cruise ship port. Holy shit. That was the greatest experience ever. Little did I know, this whole fucking graduation trip was gonna be drug-fueled, and full of fun & more nods. ",1535845720.0

That said, fentanyl has almost entirely absorbed the dope game in a matter of just a few short years. I don't even really enjoy the high of most of the dope I get anymore, because fentanyl doesn't really serve any better purpose recreationally than most other opiates. Sure, the potency is ridiculously, but the duration is incredibly short.. hence why it is usually administered in patches or lollipops etc.

So naturally as an opiate user, any media or entertainment involving opiates interests me. The new season of Ozark just came out, which imo is a great show, however, one little thing annoyed me. (Small spoilers if you haven't seen it, but not really) When the Cartel's heroin is laced w/ fentanyl and distributed all over, they get super pissed and start interrogating and killing mid-level dealers in Chicago. This is complete BS, The only benefit of fentanyl is the financial one, and the cartels are the ones who are taking full advantage of this the most in real life. It's super unrealistic, but that's not my quarrel, I get it's just a TV show. In reality, I don't understand why people like it.. it's a really dirty and short high. It seems like the more overdoses there are, the more people come looking for what caused them, fentanyl being the number 1 culprit. It sucks because there aren't any standards anymore, nobody gives a shit about the quality of the product they're pushing because they know people will buy it regardless. Not like the Frank Lucas days where his product was used as a brand and known for quality (How true that really is idk). 

It would be great if the cartel actually started murdering drug dealers that lace pure product with fentanyl and are killing massive amounts of people, but they are the biggest facilitators of this. It's almost impossible to buy even close to pure H anymore. So for those of you that enjoy it and keep buying it, can I ask why? Is it because you have no other choice, or you prefer it? Would you rather have pure dope or this new BS fentanyl laced crap? If people just stopped buying this shit, the top tier dealers and manufacturers would be forced to go back to selling pure shit. Obviously this is just a pipe dream, but it's why I just went back to pills instead, but I know most people can't afford that. That said, why not just go on the dark net and buy a bunch of fentanyl yourselves if you like it so much, it's significantly cheaper and this would put the dealers slanging this crap out of business unless they started selling pure again. Again, another pipe dream, but I'm curious to know if other opiate users feel the same way I do, or if I'm relatively alone in this opinion. ",1535844504.0

It was already posted in this sub two years ago by what I've seen, but there's so much new people here since then that I decided to post it again. Written by JENSFROMDENMARK.

Hi.

I’m not going to tell you my real name for obvious reasons but you can call me Jens. I’m an ex-pat and I came to Estonia to work here a few months ago. I have worked previously in the US, Spain and Norway where I had no problem getting the fix to my little problem, called heroin addiction. I thought cold copping is easy in Estonia as it is in any developed nation but I was soon proved wrong.
I’m going to tell you the story how I cold copped in Tallin.

—

The first time I came to Estonia was for the job interview so I didn’t stay the night and snorted a fat line of Copenhagen’s finest before boarding and as I had hid half a gram in my ass aswell for emergency reasons, I snorted like half before boarding the return flight. The following week I had a few Skype calls vice-versa with my soon-to-be employer and they hired me. Speed up the time a little bit and we are in this chilly July evening. 24 hours before the flight I steered clean of any dope and before boarding I put a 8mg Subutex under my tounge and 9 8mg Subutex’s in my ass for emergency reasons as I wouldn’t be able to survive the next days doing important shit while in withdrawal. Subutex was just my safety line. As soon as the plane landed in Tallin I took a cab from the airport to meet the realtor who gave me the keys to my apartment in downtown Tallinn which I rented via Internet beforehand. I handed the driver a piece of paper where the realtor wrote the address of the apartment and off we went. We were approaching downtown (I think?) when I saw the town was really buzzin’. It was Friday night. Then it hit me, this is the perfect time to go and look for a plug for gear in Tallin. If not today, then when? I had 9 fucking Subutex’s left in my ass and I had to head to work on Monday. I told the cab to stop and asked back the paper with the address to my apartment.

—

I stepped out of the cab somewhere near the Viru roundabout and I headed towards the place where the biggest noise was coming from, the old town. I’m a bit hipster as much as I hate to admit it and all the fuckers in my new workplace who I met while being here on the interview thingy were also dudes rocking mustaches and they were fast to give me recommendations on the place with the finest beer in the old town. But see, the thing is, I don’t give a fuck all about beer.

—

As I already I mentioned (I think?) I have cold copped loads of times before and it has never backfired. So I was going to use the same gameplan as usual. Find some sketchy looking people or some young potheads and move on from there. Entering the Viru street I immediately noticed two females nodding their fucking asses off on something but they looked too scary to approach and didn’t fit my protocol. In about 2-3 minutes I spotted a large crowd of young hip guys and gal’s aged 18-21 in front of some establishment I don’t remember the name of. I approached a dude in a camo-jacket and some skinny jeans and politely introduced myself. The murmur stopped and the crowd’s eyes were locked on me. Not to look too sketchy I swiftly moved on to the subject of drugs. I told them I needed to score weed in hopes of them leading me to someone who is selling BECAUSE, in other countries, like the US or Spain or the UK, they are usually holding something else aswell and if not, can point me in the right direction. To my surprise the dude looked at me for like 3 seconds scoping me out and then proceeded to call his mate over to us. They were speaking something in Estonian for a minute and then the other guy who came over asked how much I want and that he has it on him right now. I am literally thinking, SCORE, when I tell him something along the lines of „Yeah cool mate, I’ll grab 1/8 off you (just to be polite, It would probably sit in my desk drawer for months) and maybe you can hook me up with something else aswell?“ He gets slightly paranoid and starts assuming I’m a cop or whatever and they start mumbling in Estonian again. I notice the situation getting pretty tense and I just tell him that I’m a junkie and I need some dope. Then the other guy started getting mad and asked if I was fucking around with him and that he can give me the dope right there and then.
Turns out, we had REAALLYY fuckin’ different understandings of what ’dope’ means. They didn’t even know what gear is. At that moment I was literally thinking if I should just move on but I still felt I needed to spell it out for them.

„Guys, I don’t need weed, I don’t need MDMA, I don’t need coke or what the fuck do you have for coke here, I need H-E-R-O-I-N.“

…Silence, total silence. The situation was already as awkward as it could get because I was getting looks I had never gotten before doing this kind of shit. I swiftly said that I’ll take his weed but can he atleast point me to the direction where a fucking human being can find some Heroin in this town. They chill out and point me towards Kopli and Balti Station. They said it’s supposed to be really dangerous though and If I don’t speak Russian I shouldn’t go there. I then asked which of the two is safer to begin with and they recommended the Balti Station. One guy had joined the chat and was almost bragging-like that you guys here in Estonia have fuckloads of fire H and that Tallin is supposedly the OD capital of Europe (which I later found out to be true, only for not fucking H overdoses). I felt like I was wasting my time now and we proceeded to a little bit more closed off area so I could buy the eighth off the weed guy out of politeness and get back to what I was doing. As we were parting ways, the dude tells me that old town is infested with heroin junkies and I could probably find few in a very short time but again, he didn’t recommend it. He told me to go check out a place called ’Protest’ where I might be able to grab someone along who knows the area. I offered him 100€ just to show me the ropes himself but he declined and said he had better shit to do.

—

As I stood there, this eighth of weed in my pocket thinking what the fuck just happened. There was a fast food joint called Hesburger next to me with loads of taxi’s standing in line. I hopped in one and said I need to go to some place named ’Protest’. The driver suddenly has a large grin on his face and starts driving. Turns out, this fucking place was like 300 meters from where I boarded the cab. Cool, take your money and fuck off. As soon as I set feet out of the Taxi, HOARDES of hipsters. My eyes were literally getting cancer from the happenings going on before the front door. As you guys are local, you probably know what I’m talking about. A little bit further, I spot two dudes sitting on a bench. They were definitely 10-15 years older than the crowd I encountered in oldtown. The guys were sharing a beer and smoking a J. I was already so fed up with this shit that I just point blank told them, that if they can point me in the right direction where to get some H, I’ll give them the eighth of weed I just bought for free and 60€ on tops. To get rid of any suspicion I whipped the mini-grip bags out almost instantly and held my hand out. The dude who was smoking on the J started laughing and then looking at me with real sad puppy-like eyes, then laughing again. Then I couldn’t believe the sentence he uttered out of his mouth.

—

„Bruh, uh, *giggles*, I’m not into that shit but I can tell you for a fact that we don’t have Heroin since 2002.“

My brain literally couldn’t comprehend what he said at that moment. I tried to wrap my brain around that sentence but came up short every single time. It was like it shut itself down. After the beer drinking guy saw the reaction on my face he added:

„Yeahh, uhh, but we have this thing called fentanyl.“

Fentanyl? What do they mean? Like trans-dermal patches? You guys have addicts shooting up the gooey-like substance from trans-dermals? No wonder you guys have the highest death toll of EU but it’s not probably from overdoses but injecting all kinds of fillers in your veins which come extracting the fentanyl from the patch. The dude was a little bit confused at first but then tried to explain the situation in more details and I was slowly getting the grasp on what is really happening here. He told me that in one of the previous years, the police caught a whole 0.4 grams of Heroin PER YEAR, PER FUCKIN’ 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE. I was astonished. Thats LESS than what I rail in ONE day! The dude was explaining to me that Tallin doesn’t have stamps or anything like that, it’s only powder wrapped in aluminum foil and you got to go through some really shady characters to obtain the substance. The dude looked like he knew what he was talking about so I took his word for it but I wouldn’t stop pressuring him even though I knew the substance I would be dealing with is in a whole another league. He told me he can bell a acquitance who sells Speed (first country I ever been to where this is still alive, usually it’s meth/crack everywhere) and MIGHT know someone who can help me with my quest for a fix. They blabber over the phone and I could pick up some instant rise in the tone of their conversation when he mentioned why does he need his help for. He probably had the eighth and 60€ I promised him in mind so he kept talking to him. Finally, he put away the call and told me that someone will call him back. I hoped to god it wouldn’t take long because I was getting really fed up. But to be honest, the awe-inducing stories he told me about the substance called trimethylfentanyl intrigued me even more. I lighted up a cigarette and chit-chatted to the guys about everyday life when suddenly the dudes phone rings. The conversation is pretty short and straight forward although I can’t understand shit. He tells me I need to go to Balti Jam, infront of the Schnell hotel and wait for a girl to show up. It was safe to assume that the girl won’t be holding and needs to be taken care of. It’s the same, doesn’t matter where you are, addicts are addicts. He calls up a Taxi for me and vaguely brings up the subject of the eighth of weed and the 60 euros. I asked him to come along, he said he is not in the mood for this kind of trip (I pretty soon found out what that meant) and he’d rather not. Well, I hand the guy the stash and the money just to get some + points or karma from the „dope gods“ (mind of an addict) and wait for the taxi. He also asks for my phone real quick to put the number in there what I should be calling when I arrive at the hotel. The cab pulls up and I sit in and tell the driver where we need to go.

—

In like 5 minutes we park infront of the what looks to be the Schnell hotel and I tell the driver to keep the engine running and pull out the phone. I bell this number. At that moment I had literally no idea we were at the place I was recommended to go to earlier, the Balti Jam. The phone keeps ringing and just when I’m about to hang up a really cracked out female voice answers. The first 45 seconds she doesn’t know what the fuck I am talking about and is probably cussing at me in Russian. I calmly repeat the words „friend“; „Schnell hotell“; „taxi“ over and over ’n hope for the best. Finally I sense some recognition in her voice although I had no fucking idea what she was saying but it ended in something that sounded „minutes“ so I just said OK and ended the call. We sit there like maybe ten-fifteen minutes and the cab driver is smoking a ciggy outside while a female with a beat-up face and some missing teeth approaches the Taxi. It’s her, no doubt. She sits in, starts talking in Russian, I nod and slowly and politely as possible swivel away from the middle of the back seat so I would seat as far as possible from her. She tells something to the taxi driver and then the driver looks onto me, I nod again. We start moving. Me, an Estonian cabdriver and an absolutely cracked-the-fuck-out (or maybe withdrawals, I can’t tell) Russian girl. She is talking to me all the time and it all sounds like some jibberish and all the time I’m like „Yeah“; „Uh, uh“, „Da“ etc. She starts getting a little bit mad which I pick up from the frequency of „cyka blyats“ in her sentences in one minute frame (Yes I have worked alongside Russians before and know what it means, kinda). Then, the taxi driver jumps into the conversation and translates her shit to me. „She’s asking how many do you need and can she keep 20€?“ Cool dude! The taxi driver knows his shit. This doesn’t feel so alienating after all. Maybe I should have looked up a cheap taxi at the first place and started my search for gear there but I am already in way too deep to change the gameplan. I tell the driver that I wan’t 10 doses, which if it was H would be a gram but I had no fucking idea what she was going to bring me. Again, some Russian jibberish from the girl and the taxi driver jumps in: „She says she needs 120€, you should probably ask her to leave her purse and belongings in the taxi. If you want, I can tell her you said so.“ I was like, yeah, do it. The reaction is fuckloads of „cyka blyats“ again but she takes my money and takes her bag off her shoulders as we pull up to some really shady houses. I can read an address sign on one of them „Kopli something“. Cool. So this is the place. She leaves and me and the cab driver go for a cig outside. I ask him if it’s really that dangerous to be doing this alone and he said pretty much, yeah. Turns out, his brother is an addict and also addicted to the same stuff so I felt kinda bad for the guy for the whole ordeal and made sure to keep in mind to tip him generously. He explains to me, that this really is the overdose capital of EU and I should be really careful with the stuff and also the people I would be dealing with. I take his number just in case I need a cool driver to cold cop again in the near future, although feel bad doing it.

—

From somewhere between the shacks, the girls pink jacket starts to appear from the shadows and she sits in the car, insisting that we drive to a gas station so she can shoot herself up fast and then take her back to town. We start driving again and the girl slides 10 little aluminum-foil wraps into my hand. Soon we pull up at a Statoil and she goes in to do whatever she has to do. Meanwhile I am contemplating in my head about which ROA should I use for the substance. Given that I’ve taken 8mg of Subutex about 12 hours ago I would need alot to break through (because of the super-strong hold buprenorphine has on your receptors) the bupe. I think it’s best to do an allergy test first and snort one dose and then proceed to other ROA-s. The girl returns, all fucked up. Her speech is so slurred I couldn’t even catch a clear „cyka blyat“ from her mouth. Then I remember the girls on Viru street who I saw a few hours earlier. Yeah. Probably the same stuff. We are driving again, I don’t even know where. Russian girl’s directions. Right about now I start thinking about what the fuck I am really doing. I came off my flight, haven’t even checked „home“ yet and wen’t straight to dope hunting and am proceeding to consume something which has supposedly ended so many lives here. The meter on the taxi shows 22 something and I hand the driver a 50 eventhough the ride is not over and politely ask him to ask the girl if she has any clean rigs. She did. She handed me some really wierd ass looking rigs unlike I’ve ever seen before. Thankfully they were all in plastic wrapping and new. I also ask for some filters and get a response she doesn’t even know what the fuck I am talking about. I guess they don’t hand out filters at the exchange here if they even have one. We pull up near the oldtown somewhere and the girl gets out and yells something at me as the door closes. „If you need some more, call me“ translation (c) cab driver. Me and the cabby both exhale from relief quietly but audible enough for each other to hear. I found that pretty funny. I finally hand the driver the little paper from my realtor with my address and we start driving there. At this moment I am really wishing I didn’t get burned or something like that, with gear I would atleast know how it should look at and smell like. With this I’ve got no idea and I’ve already blown upwards of 250€ to the air.
We pull up to this apartment building not far from the hotel where I met the chick (Schnell hotel) and I hand the cab driver another 20, shake his hand and tell him hes a good guy and leave. I proceed to open the door to the elevators and go all the way up to the last floor. I open the door, throw my backpack (all my belongings I took with me) in the corner.

—

I lay the wraps with the rigs on the kitchen table and run to the shower cabin. I forgot. I still have 9 8mg Subutex’s hid up my asshole. I try to pull the string gently (which I left hanging out my chocolate starfish just a bit) so it doesn’t break and slowly get the balloon out of my asshole. I close the tap on the sink, fill it with water and put the balloon floating in there. I couldn’t be fucked doing a proper clean-up on that at the moment so I just washed my asshole and the shower cabin with the water and ran to the kitchen with a towel around my waist. When I opened the first wrap, I felt like I got grossly parred. There wasn’t even a ¼ of 0.1 gram dose. I proceed to snort the whole powder up my nose and literally feel nothing. I decide to wait for about 15 minutes and see what happens. Nothing. Not even a slightest mood lift. I am getting really agitated and thinking I got burned so I unpack a rig and mix up a solution with 2 doses and 50cc of water, from habit, I also add few drops of lemon juice and heat up the solution. I get a yellow-brown like transparent solution in the rig and without doubting myself for a second, proceed to shoot that shit up my elbow crook vein (despite not having shot up for 2 months). Oh… Ohh… YEAH… and now the rush is getting too strong even for my taste. Mainlining two doses measuring up a measly 0.035g hit through the buprenorphine like a fucking freight train. I was pulling the syringe out of my vein and the blood was literally squirting out of the vein (never happened to me before and definitely didn’t hit an artery) on to the refrigerator and oven. I was slowly fading into unconsciousness and when I woke up two hours later I honestly thought I had borderline OD-d. I threw away the rigs for safety reasons and proceeded to take out my macbook from my backpage and read up a bit on the substance called 3-methylfentanyl. Turns out, I am dealing with something as potent as 6000 times morphine (FYI, Heroin is 2-4x as potent).
I also read that it can be smoked aswell for an even faster but safer onset because you can inhale smaller amounts of the drugs at a time. Basically, this whole cold cop experience was one of the wierdest yet, or maybe the scariest due to the uber potent nature of the opioid 3-methylfentanyl. Barcelona and Atlanta ghettos were also pretty scary but like a whole different way. I ended up copping a few times a month from the girl and a few new numbers I’ve acquired and finished off the batch of wraps I got in like 2 days (ROA smoking). The way I mainly got my gear now is I called up my buddy in Copenhagen, I hopped on a flight and met my buddy in Kastrup. Shoved 10 grams of gear up in my ass and took a flight back to Tallin. I had to do this like 2-3 times a month. Pretty excruciating and if I’m honest, I was already looking for another more stable job which wouldn’t throw me around different cities around the world few weeks after starting here. I couldn’t encounter another clusterfuck like I did in Estonia again so I actively sought work in my hometown to escape this place and I am happy to say, I am working in Denmark again for the third week and railing fine Heroin #4 straight from the middle-east daily. Life couldn’t be better. Please do something for your addicts and fix your situation. I have never in my life seen addicts in such bad shape before, although I haven’t been to Russia (hint: Krokodil). Not even the African-American dope users in the US ghettos are in so bad condition (crackheads yes, dopeheads no). I can’t imagine any other developed nation enduring something like this for so long and doing literally nothing.

Thanks for reading, and please, fix your shit Estonia.

I’ve often wondered about this and would be interested to see if anyone here has any knowledge.

So, the likes of Oxy/Morphine/Diamorphine/Benzos/Hydromorphone etc etc are obviously manufactured by certain pharmaceutical companies spread out across the UK/US, wherever.

Obviously these batches of drugs then need to make their way from manufacturing plant to wholesaler warehouse. 

How are these shipments protected? 

I appreciate there must be a tried and tested system but am curious as to what that is? I mean, from a simplistic standpoint, the location of these plants are public knowledge. You don’t see lorries heading up and down the motorway with the police in convoy.

What promoted the question is the following news story. Have a quick read if you have the time...

From the start. This is my main guy... I see him every single day... And spend 150. Today I had a double shift at work... Started at 1030 am. I asked him just to drop me off at work since it was on the way back for him... And I needed to see him anyways. So he comes to get me... Paranoid as always. He said there are cops parked outside. So I roll my eyes and go and look... Nothing but someones parole officer. He makes me walk clear across my complex to get in his car anyways. So I stop at the bp bc I needed to take money out... We leave there and right across the street there is a flower shop someone else he deals with works at. She called to see him so we swing around back and she says "" my bf just ran across to the atm to grab the money so just pull up a second"". He was like no I'll just brb bc he had to drop me off. As soon as he hands her the shit... A fucking swat team surrounds us... At LEAST 20 of them... Guns drawn... Like GET THE FUCK ON THE GROUND. I was immediately like... Well my life is def over as I lay on the ground everything I worked for and accomplished in the last 3 yrs here just fade the fuck away and I'm basically just totally numb at that point. They arrest us both. They said they have had him and his ppl under watch for months and months. They have even sat outside of my place... And my job... Taking pictures of him selling to me. Thank Jesus Christ he didn't sell to me yet so I had no dope on me. I did have my needles... Which they gave a fuck less about and threw away. They still take me down to the station... Where I had to sit for 8 hrs in an interrogation room. Which they asked me questions but I told them I literally know nothing about him He's just my dude. They have nothing on me so they eventually let me go at like 6pm. So I missed both of my shifts. Luckily in 3 yrs I've never called off or done any kind of no call no shows... None of that shit. So work was inclined to believe I had a major emergency that didn't include me being caught up in a sting. Long story short... Be FUCKING CAREFUL guys. I never expected that... And I'm sure he didn't expect a girl he's been serving for years to put the nail in his coffin by serving her in a controlled buy. I'm just fucking thankful I'm ok... I feel terrible for him tho... And how fucking annoyed he made me being so paranoid. That was the last thing he said to me when we had guns pointed at us. Basically... Told u so.

I’m watching the news here in the land down under, and the state I reside in is apparently implementing a real time prescription monitoring program (according to the ridiculous government propaganda that shows someone’s head being swallowed by a comically large pill designed as a pillow). 

So doctors and pharmacists can check (and soon will be legally required to) check on a database your history for drugs of addiction (think opioids, benzos, amphetamines, all the fun stuff). 

For my American colleagues in particular, do you think these programs are or have proven effective? I guess it’s a seperate issue from the DEA threatening to pull a docs prescribing privileges for “overprescribing”, but somewhat intertwined. 

It may deter the “casual” doctor shopper, but realistically I can think of half a dozen ways to circumvent it just off the top of my head. 

Judging by how many of our friends in the States have “plugs” for Oxymorphone etc, I can’t imagine it’s been THAT successful? 

Or will it simply be an inconvenience that professional doctor shoppers (who sell their scores) will overcome & drive the casual ones who bounce from doc to doc for the equivalent of a Tylenol 3 script, into the arms of Heroin / Fent dealers? 

TL/DR Do these programs work to deter doctor shopping or just drive people to Heroin etc? ",1535790601.0

He told me it was a concoction of fentanyl and a few other things I do not remember. Was pretty cool to get to try it in such a safe environment, but damn was that shit crazy.

I have never been on any detox-drug like suboxone before and honestly have never been interested in them - I had several misconceptions about them that are now mostly cleared up after actually doing some actual research. 

&#x200B;

Now that I've learned a bit about them, I think this might be just the thing I need to help me finally get clean for good. The thing is, the last dose of heroin I took is already out of my system (I know because they did a drug test while I was in the psych ward - I tested positive for amphetamines and marijuana but negative for everything else, including opiates). Does this disqualify me from potentially being prescribed suboxone while in a residential treatment center? 

&#x200B;

I'm not really sure what kind of information to include... maybe my current withdrawal symptoms? I don't really experience the ""typical"" heroin withdrawal symptoms like I've heard horror stories about - the shakes and chills and discomfort that supposedly lasts about a week for most people. When *\*I\** try to get clean, it's more of a subtle, long & drawn-out type of withdrawal: I am overcome with intense fatigue to the point where I'm unable to do anything except sleep or laze around, I become so apathetic and demotivated and depressed that I have absolutely no regard for my personal hygiene or any type of self-care whatsoever, and during the rare occasion that I am actually somewhat awake and somewhat inspired to do something, I can't for the life of me concentrate at all, in any sense of the word.

&#x200B;

So, to sum up my primary questions: 1. Is it a possibility that I will be prescribed suboxone (or a similar drug) when I enter a residential treatment facility tomorrow, even though I've had a little bit of clean time and my drug tests come back ""clean?"", 2. Are my withdrawal symptoms normal for a heroin and meth addict, and can my symptoms be attributed primarily to either heroin or meth?, 3. If there's no possibility of being prescribed suboxone at this point, is there any other medication that might help me? I've heard of drugs being used mostly for alcohol withdrawals but I'm unfamiliar with the medications typically used to treat withdrawals from heroin and meth.

Essentially I am a chronic pain patient who has found oxycodone to be the most helpful opioid medication for my pain, however, I am facing some financial trouble and my oxy is not automatically covered by my provincial disability health insurance and I have other meds to buy for my condition that are also necessary and expensive and not covered. I am considering eating less and have been looking for a cheaper place, however, the most practical place I can save money is on my medication as some other opiates are covered by my province as I have been on Tylenol 3 and MS Contin without any cost out of pocket and I also think the Percocet was covered, it’s just the morphine is too much for me even at low doses and the Percocet doesn’t last for 10+ hours like the oxy does.

I don’t know what to do. I need a refill and can’t really afford to keep paying out of pocket. I have been told 2mg hydromorphone should be covered but I am skeptical if taking those by mouth will be as effective and last as long as the oxy. Oxy is ideal because it doesn’t impair me or give me the effect that morphine does and I need to have a clear mind and they just brought in a new drug test for impaired driving I’m really worried about. FYI I usually need between 25-40+mg per day of oxy in a few smaller doses. Without my medication I honestly contemplate ending my life, however, no fear reddit all is well and I find meaning in my life and am relieved from my suffering at times by my therapies but I need to bring my costs down and keep my pain controlled. 

What’s the best option? Stop eating fresh food and stay on the oxy. And try and get it covered but the drs and pharmacists are so weird about pain medication. 

Should I ask for Percocet again? 

I can’t have two different opiates.

I could consider MS Contin but would need a stimulant which worsens my pain.

I have no experience with hydro morph but hear all sorts of things about it and am not sure what to think I will only take it orally and need 6-10 hours of pain relief and don’t like the morphine effect I prefer the oxy because I can’t tell I’ve taken it most times only that my pain is more tolerable.

So I had to repost this a few times because other subreddits kept taking it down and other subscribers to this sub told me to just post it here  so that's what I'm  doing now. Enjoy

 Had to repost this since > tHe FoRmAtInG iS uNrEaDabLe< or something. Anyways, here it is. 

This is a personal expierence, or it could have been... maybe. As a warning ignore all my spelling, gramatical, and sentence construction mistakes. I failed English 3 times, it's not my fault I'm more of a math and science kind of guy. Also you'll probably see way to many commas. 

Anyways, for some context, have you ever recalled an old memory maybe from your early childhood that you could of sworn really happened but as you grew older, I'm 19 now I'm case youre wondering, you started convincing yourself that it had to be a dream. There was just no way that could of happened, or maybe you really hope that it didnt. Well this happened to me and I wanted to share it and see if anyone can shine some light on it or reassure me that it was a dream. 

So when I was about 4ish my family and I used to live in a kind of big house in the suburbs near Chicago, near Chicago meaning over an hour drive maybe an hour if you're driving on weeknight at 1am and have luck on your side. 

I had a lot of good memories in that house but the more I think back the more unsettling it becomes, other members of my family have weird occurances that could possibly tie in with mine but maybe we'll save that for another time since I'm starting to ramble. 

So getting back to the story, some important info is that back then i didnt have my own room, I slept in my parents room most nights. Also, me and my dad loved sleeping inn the cold we just can't stand the heat. So on hot nights we would sleep on the floor so it was colder while my mom slept on the bed since she's always hated the cold and prefers warm weather. 

So for a while leading up to when this happened my mom had been complaining about her back hurting and waking up in pain in the morning, the words that stuck out to me were "" it felt like someone heavy had been sitting on me all night "" or something like that but I'm Spanish. 

So getting to it now after going to bed with my dad on the floor, since it was a hot night, I had woken at some point in the night. And for some reason I thought that i would peek over the edge of the bed and look at my mom real quick just to check on her I guess. 

So I got on my knees to look over the bed and I see this big human shaped shadow, and when I say big I mean big like it's head almost touched the ceiling, and it was just staring down at my mother in bed. I quickly ducked down behind the bed and covered my mouth. For some stupid reason I decided to steal another glace instead of waking up my dad, but when I looked I saw the shadow dead ass sitting on my mom staring blankly out the window and that's about when the memory ended. Its not that I can't remember I just never had any memory of what happened after that. 

I guessed I passed out because I ended up waking up at night time the next day like I had slept for almost a while day. I quickly ran downstairs to then kitchen ecstatic to tell my mom what i had seen and why her back hurt but my memory ends there for that time. All I remember is my family looking at me weirdly because I just ran in there screaming at my mother that I knew why her back hurt and then blank I have no more memory. 

I have stories of my mom being cursed by her old mother in law/ my older half brother and sister's grandma who was supposedly a witch of you believe in that sorta stuff. Also supposedly my older sister's great aunt or something was trying to contact her even tho shes been long dead. 

Anyways if you have similar experiences or can help me with mine thatd be grate. Would love feedback, thanks alot. ",1535761429.0

It's payday and I have a nice little pickup scheduled for after work, so the weekend is shaping up nicely. Anyway, had a funny story from earlier in the week I thought you guys might enjoy.

So my dealer is an older gentleman, disabled and has to get around in a chair because he lost one of his legs. Really nice guy and sometimes when I pickup I'll chat with him for a few. I was sitting outside with him shooting the shit and I notice this young black guy walking up. He's dressed in business attire, looks like he's just coming from work. He walks up to my guy and without saying anything hands him what appears to be funds for a parking meter. Yeah, a fistful of assorted pocket change. 

My guy shoots him a look of both confusion and annoyance. The young fellow says ""I told you, I'm going to make this right"". My dude says ""What is this bullshit? You told me you was gonna bring all of it"". I'm now realizing this is a debt collection situation and I miss some of the back and forth of what is being said as I feel a little awkward sitting there listening to this dispute. This kid keeps standing there saying things like ""Don't you see my car over there? I got an apartment. I honor my word"".

I'm just chuckling to myself the way this dude is listing his basic level life accomplishments like it somehow excuses whatever his fault in this little dispute is, and validates that he is in fact a responsible adult. Anyway, he finally storms off and they close it out with a sort of ""whatever bro/fuck you"" type exchange. I ask my guy about it and he explains he's been selling this dude crack and the guys has slowly gotten in way over his head, and owes a good bit of money. He's also supposedly a really conniving ""steals from his own mother"" kind of rat bastard, but is in complete denial about his status as an addict, AND actually looks down on other admitted addicts.

The last thing my guy says is something about how easily he ""could have this dude dealt with"" and ""made to disappear"". I don't know what was funnier, the idea of someone getting subtracted because they tried to pay a debt installment with arcade money, or that the guy even bothered showing up with like $1.35 in nickels to make a good faith debt payment.

Now for the past 2 yrs, have been on kratom, which is a lesser evil, but still at 60-80g a day, withdrawal can be/is just as bad as IV heroin IME. And I was sick of opioids/ates running my life.**

After a serious failed attempt to get help, earlier this year, where things just went wrong (oh btw this was the ONLY other time I relapsed over the span of 2 yrs and wasnt bad as now, did a 6-7 day bender, then got back home, and got back on kratom with no issues. 

​

​

**But this was a failed attempt at getting Treatment from an Ibogaine Clinic, I know the owner, he was going to help me get treatment for a serious discount under a certain condition, I kinda did my part. But the guy I relied on to come with me, Shafted me and didn't show up, So I was stuck in mexico, I told the owner I wanted to at least come to the clinic and visit, since I had a 1wk round trip ticket, he kinda just said he was busy and ignored me. Although I didnt have enough for treatment, I had $2k, and I offered to pay this as a down payment, then perhaps stay in mexico and work at his clinic to pay it off, or even stay there, or go home, and make 400-500$ monthly payments (using my mere $500 disability monthly check) to pay off the rest. He basically ignored me(while i was in mexico, simply asking to visit him and check out his clinic, Even thought I didn't have the money, I would have been glad to meet up with my friend(the Nurse, who now runs/own his own world class facility) and take a tour of the clinic, in case I do ever have the money and come back, I even offered $1,000+ to stay anywhere near his clinic, or get a room there for just a WEEK. (again I only had 2k, which was like 8 months of saving for me).**

​

​

This is where I learned that all of these clinic owners, no matter how nice they may be, at the end up of the day, are very money driven. I still think this guy who used to be a nurse at another Ibogaine clinic in 2015 and treated me back then, is an awesome dude, and absolutely the best nurse I have ever been treated by, Better/nicer/more professional/more caring/bedside manner, than ANY healthcare professional that has treated me in the US (Psychiatrists, MDs, Nurses, Psychologists, Therapists, etc). Healthcare workers here have seriously let me down, and they are absolutely terrible and VERY unprofessional and I have had HORRIFYING experiences with them to where I still face PTSD to this day from. Ugh my short term memory is fucked. Sorry if this isn't in chronological order, and sorry about the terrible formatting, I am not very familiar with reddits formatting and in general have not written or formatted anything online for years.........

​

**But This is where I was absolutely TORN APART. I felt rejected by the owner who I thought was my friend. I wanted to at least use the money I had to visit him or pay to stay in a room in his clinic and just see how things work for the week I was there, but he was ALWAYS busy and couldn't talk, EVEN WHEN I TOLD HIM IM IN MEXICO TO COME SEE HIM. (To be fair, im sure he was/is very busy running an Ibogaine clinic, But, I'm sure he could have arranged something or made time to see me for one or 2 days. Or even just let me drop by the clinic. (I didn't want to show up unannounced, but looking back I probably should have, maybe it would have saved me from wasting all my money partying in TJ and going on that bender.....Still, of course I don't blame anyone but myself. But the asshole ex-patient who was supposed to be my friend completely flaked on me, which made me lose my opportunity to get treated for 1k. Still my fault, for not planning better. Oh and also, on their website, it said they had ketamine infusion therapy, which is obviously way cheaper than ibogaine, they do like 6 infusions over 2 wks or somehting. I was extremely interested in trying this out for my treatment resistant MDD. And I asked the owner about it, (not to mention I probably could have afforded the infusions with my $2k, as is it wayyyy cheaper than ibogaine.  His response was,**

If you guys like stories, lol my time in TJ is a whole differnt story, and if I continue doing coke, or take some adderall maybe Ill write the whole story about that, IF there is interest (involves bringing 3 fam. members, all females with me, getting shaken down by corrupt cops, but outsmarting them twice because I know how they work). And meeting a very interesting guy, who worked in a head shop, who was obv. Caucasian and claimed to be a german national, was very vague about who he was and what he did, But he had a bunch of Jordanian flags outside his shop(this is where my dad is from, and where I LIVED and did high school for 4 YRS. although I was born and raised here, But this white dude, spoke PERFECT Arabic, in multiple different dialects, Jordanian, Iraqi, etc and I was extremely impressed. Also spoke Spanish and English, Was obvious that he did more than run a fukin tiny tobacco/headshop in Tijuana, Im willing to bet he was in some type of intelligence service for wherever he was from (CIA, Or Some type of intelligence service, agency, maybe for his country of origin, which i still dont know, but he was NOT Arab, but spoke it perfectly and better than me, which was so cool)

​

​

**Mostly while being 'treated' for WD/mentall illness in a psych ward, but I would consider it tortured and used as a guinea pig in a psych. ward, in my state. They were AWFUL, they insulted me, called me a junkie (while I was extremely dopesick, puking, couldnt get up to use the bathroom, diahearea leaking, couldnt urinate, had wayyy too much anxiety and pain and weakness to even talk or move my mouth, so I couldnt even respond while they were calling me a 'typical junkie' and making fun of my mom who came to visit me while I was hospitalized (This is a whole different very LONG STORY, but back then years ago, I thought tianeptine would be a good replacement and get me off opioids, I started shooting it, 100mg a day, that shit is like super glue when you cook it up (anyone who tried this would know).  But eventually after close to a yr. Tianeptine DESTROYED all of my veins permanently. I mean it did more damage than years of IV drug use (h/coke/dissos/even filtered pills) etc........ But I was hospitalized kinda because I had suicidal thoughts and wanted to quit tianeptine at the same time (at this point my veins were completely gone so I was taking it orally and obviously had to take wayyyyy more to reach the same effects. But my IV use was prob up to 1-2g a day maybe more I dont remember, now my oral dose, was ...... well I dont want to say, im not proud of it. I was taking several grams, multiple times per day after being on it for a few months....Was not getting 'high' I just built an insane tolerance and need that amount to function.**

​

I did not just 'relapse' I dont even like that word, but i know addicts/people in 'recovery' use it.  But I went from using only Kratom and prescribed meds, for the better part of the last 2 years, To becoming a full blown speedball junkie, In the span of 2 weeks, and Using more than I did, when I was at my peak usage in '14-'15' before/while I got on methadone, and then did Ibogaine in 2015, to get off the methadone. The Ibogaine worked really well for acute WD, given I was using it to get off of 100+ mg methadone, and still shooting a gram of H some days, usually on my one take home day, Id save the take home and shoot a gram+ a day, and given the blocking effect, id shoot like .5g of decent quality shit in one shot. And I didnt really get deep into speedballing, but I think I first tried it a few yrs into my h usage, maybe 2014 or something, and wow, it was the most amazing rush ever (im talking fishscale coke with good quality dope)... however I was able to control my usage of speedballs and only use them on special occasions, or when I had the extra money.

​

​

^(But anyways I did Ibogaine in 2015, at the time I was on methadone, the clinic told me I had to be off of methadone for at least 2+ weeks or something, and to switch to a short acting opiate, I was pretty ecstatic about this, Because they basically told me to start shooting dope again for 2 weeks prior to treatment, Same goes for suboxone, I think for suboxone, you have to be off of it even longer, im not sure, but i believe it is because they have such a long half life, and after being on them for months/years, they take a few wks to fully leave your system, and while doing Ibogaine, you cannot have opiates in your system.  But anyways, Even though I switched back to h for a measly 2 weeks before going to the clinic, the WD was still basically Methadone WD because I had been on it for over a year, and only switched back to h for 2 weeks, and boy did I have to use a lot, the blocking effect lasted at least a week, gradually slowing down as the days went by, but yea, after a week of doing like 1.5g+ a day just to get well, I needed so much since the blocking effect was so strong. But after like 5-7 days or so, I would be able to get by on less and get a better rush as the done left my system.)

​

​

>^(Anyways, so again this was in 2015 that I got ibogaine treatment, the owner of the clinic was very friendly, and since my family was so poor, took us in on a 'scholarship' program, where they treated one patient a month at like half price, which was like 2500$,+airfare, They even said they did not make money off of the 2500's, which completely made sense. Reg price back then was like 5k or so, now its 6.5k  (at the best clinic in mx, very luxurious) and I think that covers airfare. Just saying, I think even at that price its worth every penny. But anyways, I think I made a post somewhere else with more details about my treatment in 2015, basically it did the job, And within a few days, Immediately after ingesting ibogaine I felt relief from WD, and tripped hard for a good 18+ hrs or so. And after the trip, took a day or so to recover, and pretty much 80%+ of acute WD, was gone, and we're talking methadone wds. So it did its job. However, aftercare is very important, and I had no plan, so I ended up relapsing on one methadone 40mg tab when I got back that I found in my room, and holy shit I got pretty blasted off of that 40mg, while 120mg prior to ibogaine was just keeping me well. So another benefit of ibogaine is It has the ability to reset tolerance, or lower it significantly, If I had the money I would do it just for this....  But anyways, after that 40mg done relapse, I ended up in a psych ward. for psychiatric reasons, and this was perhaps my first time in a psych ward I believe, and it wasn't bad at all, because I had no WD, and still felt pretty refreshed from the ibogaine, and was pretty functional without opiates, which was a miracle.)

​

The reason I'm sharing this is because I was expecting to completely turn my life by doing an ibogaine flood again, whether it be at a clinic or at home, by my birthday... So if you really want some more context or want to read, it will make more sense

​

​

But, for many different reasons..... I could make a whole page listing why I chose to do so.... I fuckin 'relapsed' shortly after my 28th birthday . I normally do not have the energy or focus or motivation to write stuff on here, or even respond to people(family/friends) on FB messenger, because I am debilitated by my mental illness, but the dope/coke as bad as it is, temporarily makes me pretty functional.... I usually take showers like once a week at most up to once every 2 weeks, at my worst I could go months without a shower... Thats how bad my MDD/ptsd/mental illness was/is. But 'relapsing' and using daily for these past 2 weeks, I have been taking showers daily. And writing, a LOT. Responding to friends/family. I wish they had Herion Assissted Treatment(HAT) Programa in the US, like they have implemented in More than a half dozen countries in Europe and Canada. I think this may be one of my last hopes. I have tried methadone and suboxone, and while they did help somewhat, the cons outweigh the pros.

# 

[If you have never heard of (HAT), here is a quick readup, showing how extremely effective it has been in countries where implemented.  Every published evaluation of HAT has shown extremely positive outcomes: major reductions in illicit drug use, crime, disease and overdose; and improvements in health, wellbeing, social reintegration and treatment retention.](http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/DPA%20Fact%20Sheet_Heroin-Assisted%20Treatment_%28Feb.%202016%29.pdf) ^(I would gladly go live in any of these European countries, to get this treatment, and to get away from my toxic living situation. But of course, even if I did have the money to travel to Europe and live there, I strongly doubt they will accept US citizens in their HAT program.) [Even appears they have it in Canada, but appears to still be in clinical trials/infancy,](http://drugpolicy.ca/issues/harm-reduction/heroin-assisted-treatment/) ^(As much as I love being an American, I would gladly give up my US citizenship and Become an EU or Canadian Citizen if it allowed me to participate in a HAT program. I mean if it would give me my life back, im willing to do anything/live anywhere. So if anyone Europeans or Canadians have any idea if this would be a possibility for a US citizen with dual citizenship(Jordan), please let me know. I doubt it though.)

​

**^(If you are too lazy to google it or click the link HAT is basically where you go into a clinic (usually 2 times daily)** **and under dr supervision they administer IV 100% pure Pharm. grade Diamorphine to addicts, usually a last resort who have not responded well to methadone/suboxone, or anything else. Now, being pharm grade, 99.9% pure stuff, I'd probably be happy with one shot every 12 hrs, as pure stuff would have much longer 'legs'. Instead of shooting up this avg. 11% purity street shit 3-5+ times a day)**

​

**^(I doubt we will see this in the US in my lifetime, with our strict/outrageous drug laws/failed 'war on drugs'. Shit, in my state, people are still getting arrested for possesion of weed, I had to do 6 months probation for possession of like 2 grams of weed and 'paraphernalia'.  Its ridiculous.)**

​

​

>**Sorry Im really stimulated, and im not sure where Im going with this. Just stating a pipe dream of mine I suppose. You can skip through that if you want to just hear about my relapse and in the span of 2wks how I went from being on just Kratom (Albeit high doses) to becoming a full blown junkie/addict(I dont like these words, but I have been acting like one, worse than ever, lately, Over a period of JUST 2 WEEKS!**

​

# 

​

(Turning 28 and my life heading nowhere(Or actually constantly spiraling downwards especially started getting bad in my early 20's, which is the most common age for depression/mental illness to manifest/hit in full force) is one of the main reasons, Also was expecting to just do it for my birthday To enjoy it 'one last time' BECAUSE AFTER GOING TO MEXICO EARLIER THIS YR, WITH ALL MY DISABILITY MONEY SAVED UP,  WAS SUPPOSED TO GET INTO AN IBOGAINE CLINIC, WHERE I AM ""FRIENDS"" WITH THE OWNER.

​

I ONLY HAD 2k and Treatment is like 6.5k BUT HE SAID IF I RECRUIT OR BRING ANOTHER PATIENT WITH ME AND THEY PAY FULL PRICE, HE WOULD GIVE IT TO ME FOR 1k, Now me and him *were* pretty good friends, I got treated by him in 2015, He was a nurse at another Ibogaine clinic at the time(We have kept in touch since, through FB from time to time),

​

​

He now owns his own clinic, Which is probably the best one in Mexico, World Class Facility, Entire medical facility/hospital, but at the same time very homey/luxurious rooms on the beachfront in a gated community. I wasn't too surprised either about how he went from being a nurse at a clinic, to opening his own. He was/is Very Passionate about what he does, and really cares about his patients, he treated me better than Any Healthcare professional (Dr's/Nurses/Techs/Etc) In the US. He really was/is an all around great person/Healthcare Professional .

​

Sorry Im taking this too far, I've been shooting fucking crack and coke/speedballing all night. (something I haven't done in years).  Im not proud of it. But hey it allows me to get on here and talk, Something I can never do in my normal depressive state, When on 'nothing' or even my prescribed meds, I am still debilitated and have wayyy too much anxiety to get online and talk to strangers and even family and closest friends, I just ignore them.... Not because I want to, but because I just cant talk. I always considered my opiate use 'self medicating', rather than 'chasing a high', I never aim to 'nod out' And I go from being debilitated from depression, to being almost completely functional after using opiates....Started with prescribed pain pills like most, which led to dope, I guess started messing with it around 2012 but took a good 2 yrs to become a fully blown addict/dependent on them. I did hold a job, and function better than usual on them. But eventually, it was just not feasible so I stopped.

​

TR MDD, Is what led my drug use (mainly opioids/opiates) after not responding to over not a dozen but maybe 2 dozen Antidepressant meds of every single class throughout the years, as well as therapy/CBT and any type of treatment I had access to with medicaid, or with my limited funds. I WANT TO DO ECT RIGHT NOW, But its not covered by medicaid, thats how desperate I am. I am Willing to Amputate a limb, if it cures my depression and I can feel 'normal' again. As in being able to enjoy things, and feel pleasure, energy, confidence, motivation, sex drive, etc...... Everything mental illness has taken away from me.

​

And Literally went from using just Kratom and prescribed meds, (klonopin+Parnate) to Doing H/Coke/Crack IV Speedballs DAILY And using more than I ever did when I was a full blown H junkie in 2013-2015. And back then, I only did speedballs on very rare occasions and managed to stay away from them, now, I'm Doing them daily, And within 2 wks, I reached the same tolerance/usage amount when I was at my peak in like '14'-15 which was 1g up to 2g (at my very worst a day). And when I speedballed, I'd do 100mg of coke power or freebase(cooked with an acid) It was on rare occasions when I had the money and connections and id be satisfied after doing 2-3 100mg hits max.

​

​

​

So,  I contacted this patient I got treatment with in 2015(he was my neighbor, room next to mine), This dude was crazy, he arrived like one night after me, and on either his first or 2nd night, We became well acquainted, (both of us from the south), He would come in my room and chill during the late night, but my room although like on a 3rd story, there was like a 4-5ft distance from my window that you could jump and get to the street.... Not sure how to explain, the clinic was in a gated community, but there was this little security loophole I guess.

​

He busted out the screen and jumped out the window and found a taxi, took one to TJ, and stayed out pretty late, partied, fucked a hooker, and did dope, and brought some back..... and leaving is strictly against the rules

​

​

anyways I could write a whiole story about this guy and my relationship with him, were still in touch until now

​

BUT,,, I contacted him earlier this year, before booking my flight(S) to mx, (brought some fam. memebrs) and again this was the dude that did treatment with me in 2015,  he also has problems relapsing every now and then. hes always talking about his good job and how much money he makes. But I asked him if he'd be willing to go to mexico and do the treatment with me again, (so that I could get the treatment for $1k) , he said yea, Anytime.... So earlier this yr, I booked my flight, and expected him to come along. on the last second he shafted me and said he cant make it he was busy with work or something,

​

Soi I was stuck in mexico, hoping to get treatment,..... I contacted the owner and told him I was in mexico and that the dude shafted me, and asked if I could come visit the clinc, stay there, do some work possibly in return for treatment. The owner said he was really busy, and stopped replying me. I was stuck in Tijuana with a 1 week return flight. and I had 2k saved up that took me a whole yr to save up with my disability money and fuckin, I didnt know what to do. I atleast wanted to go stay at the clinic or something. the owner ignored me, even tho i told him id like to come visit.

​

**OH AND THIS IS VERY RELEVANT. I WANTED THE IBOGAINE TO GET OFF OF KRATOM, BECAUSE IT WAS RUNNING MY LIFE... 60G a DAY OF KRATOM, and IT COMPLETELY LOST ITS EFFECTS AFTER THE 2 YRS OF BEING ON IT. I WAS JUST TAKING IT TO NOT GET SICK, AND BE SLIGHTLY FUNCTIONAL. Now kratom WD you would think is benign, which it is, if you're taking a normal dose of like 10g a day, or something in that ballpark. However the 60-80grams a day I was taking, the WD could be just as bad as dope, if not worse. I have nothing against kratom, I just used it the wrong way, as maintenance, still better than being on done or subs............The kratom was running my life, having to dose every 5-6 hours, BUT THIS PAST 2 YEARS especially PAST YEAR, I HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FROM SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, AND COMPLETELY DEBILITATED BY THEM............I was putting sooo much hope in the Ibogaine, I was ready take thing things seriously.**

​

​

**But it just didnt work out (Earlier this year in april, So for the time I was stuck in TJ I did what any ex-junkie would do, and for the first time in about a yr and a half, I relapsed on IV Heroin, IV METH, IV Coke, you name it..... went on a complete bender for 6-7 days that i was there,,.......I was soooo frustrated with my ex-co-patient, for not coming through (we stayed in touch on fb for yrs and i considered him a friend).,,, he has money so I was relying on him to come and get treatment at full price so i could get the discount of $1k, which was an awesome offer that the owner gave me because he knew me well and we stayed in touch... But yea when i got to mexico I tried to just go stay at the clinic for the week that i was there, I offered the Owner to pay for just a room and hoped I could just chill there without treatment...... but I guess in the end It all comes down to money. I thought he truly cared....... im pretty sure If I had the money for treatment (6.5k$) he would have immediately snet someone to pick me up and took me in.... but instead since I was broke, he just told me he was busy and ignored me...........**

​

**So that was earlier this year why I relapsed, but anyways it was no biggie, I got back home, and just started kratom again, went thru a bit of suffering for a few days but increased my kratom dose and I was fine and back to normal...........**

​

**Now why I relapsed these past 2 weeks is another story...............**

​

​

Shiiiit ive been sitting here for hours shooting up and missing hits, of crack  and h dissolved in citric acid....... I know thats fucking bad and i should see a dr Etc.......I would register and draw up blood clots, then the syringe would clog so when i pushed it was clogged and wouldnt go in, so id have a syringe full of blood clots with 200mg of crack/coke and 150mg of dope.......  I wouldnt want to waste it, so id pull out the plunger then dump it in the cooker, add some heat and maybe water,,, Refilter it, oh and there would be a blood clot that looks like a little red worm,... its disgusting.... but id draw up the blood drug solution.,,, mostly crack+citric acid, and sometimes dope........

​

And when Im shooting crack/coke, I have no self control, I get crazy and always miss and redose compulsively even tho I know its not gonna be the same rush...... I will be so shaky that I miss like over half of the hits, so thats citric acid,crack and sometimes blood getting skin popped.... I have lumps, bruises, abscesses all over my arms that I developed in a mere 2 weeks

​

**I fucking went through 1 gram of IV crack and a gram of dope, in one night, Mostly because I missed most of the crack hits....... Id prefer coke btw, but good shit thats not stepped on is hard to find. It sucks, because All I wanted was one Good ""BellRinger"" from the crack/coke And because my arm veins are so fucked up (yea they are permanently damaged collapsed, due to IV use YEARS ago, Even though I havent touched them for years at a time allowing them to recover, they never really did..... One in my right arm kinda came back but its really shallow and small and just hard to hit..... (Oh btw 90% of this permanent vein damage is due to a phase where I thought I was off of opiates and I was IV'ing Tianeptine sodium powder, oh boy if any of u  have experience u know what im talking about that shit is like super glue... I got myself hooked on it in 2015-2016, thinking it would be a good replacement for opioids, and boy was I wrong.........**

**That is another story in itself......**

​

​

But oh so, the Reason I relapsed 2 weeks ago and ffucking went ballistic, and still am, well its a very long complicated story and I had many reasons(Keep in mind prior to relapsing 2 weeks ago i was using nothing but kratom in high doses, and dr prescribed meds, Klonopin and Parnate (MAoi as a last resort since nothing worked, but Im off of it now, for reasons i will explain later if there is interest)

​

**But Yea, so  after my failed attempt at getting ibogaine treatment earlier this year. I continued kratom and yea like I said I Was up to 60-80 grams a day.... dosing every 5-6 hours, letting it run my life. the main issue is that it was doing nothing, and obviously for years, if you read most of this, you would see that I could never stay off of opioids, no matter how many times I detoxed or what methods used, even CT'ed multiple times. Every time I would get off, even months after being clean, I would be debilitated and more depressed than ever and very suicidal.... So i always ended up back on them. However I just turned 28, I had planned a month or so before my birthday, that I was finally going to take things seriously and get off of opiates once and for all. I ordered the ibogaine myself on July 1st,  (Because i could not afford a clinic) and even the $500 it costed took me months to save up and was a lot of money to me.**

​

I planned on taking shit seirously this time around. I thought I would have the ibogaine by my birthday, and I had trip sittiers, I got an EKG and Bloodwork done to make sure I was healthy enough for it, I was ready to completely turn my life around........... But things went terribly wrong again....... The ibogaine never came. I had planned on doing it before or on my birthday and making a seirous offer to stay sober....... I was torn apart that it didnt arrive in time, in fact its been about 2 months since I placed  the order and IT still Did not arrive..............

​

​

**So this is one of the reasons I got frustrated and relapsed on my birthday, however some other crazy shit happened, like 3-4 weeks ago that landed me in the psych ward. Its a long story, but against my own will I got locked up in there for a week and had to go through kratom wd (I know it sounds benign but I was taking 80g a day, WD was just as bad as a serious Iv heroin addiction), and they also cut me off of benzos Cold turkey, Like I get 4mg klonopin daily from my pdoc, and they Did not give me any benzos....... Even though i was prescribed them legitimately, they didnt give me shit for the kratom WD. I tried asking for suboxone, and although they do give it to some people, they said id have to be there for a week atleast to get on it..... I was suffering like crazy tho......... Full blown opioid WD and to make things worse Benzo wd, they gave me a low dose of gabapentin to avoid seizures, which i already take everyday and doesnt do shit.......**

​

​

**But this psych ward was dingy and disgusting and the staff were awful..... The nurses were rude, and didnt listen when i told them i wasnt sleeping, the dr only came in like for 1 hr every other day or w/e and saw me for like 5 mins, and was a dumbass. He was a psychiatrist, and he didnt know what MAOIs were, or what Parnate was...... like wtf.  I could barely express my complaints of concerns because i was in so much pain from the double WD and had so much anxiety, I literally spent the whole 7 days i was there tossing and turning and exmtremly restless in bed..... I had to BEG them for immodium.... some nurses would give it to me after begging, some would ask to see a 'stool sample' and act suspicious when I was asking for an anti diarrhea MED.......**

​

But overall was a terrible experience and my 2nd time in a psych ward this year............ This place was the worst ever tho, they have like a 2 star rating on google....... I have PTSD from psych wards. but again that is another story.........

​

​

But anyways, after 7days in the psych ward, without my klonopin or kratom, I wanted IMMEDIATE RELIEF. This is a huge part of what made me relapse and go crazy with it... i was still WDing when I got out after 7 days.... Although I deleted all my dope contacts years ago, i immediately went downtown, looked for the stragglest looking dopehead mfer, and asked them if they could get ""dog food and girl or hard"" , they pointed out this girl who worked as a street tarot reader, she said she would help me, she took me like on a 15-20 minute walk to her dboy to score.... we waited a bit she called him from my phone..... and I had 85$, I asked for like 50/50 dope/coke. and of course, she broke off half for herself obivously, but it was cool. I was glad to get anything. I Got home and immediately did the dope to relieve my WD's. I only did 100mg, and it Lasted like 12 hours, I didnt crave more til the next day....... I started with 100mg, but slowly because i added in the coke, that would make me use way more

​

​

​

basically she left her delaers num in my phone, I Got ahold of him and started copping off him. these past 2 weeks I have used more dope and coke and spent more than I ever did in my life..........

​

going through a midlife crisis......

​

​

I had soooo much hope in ibogaine, but things went wrong once again. Anyways I have less than a g of dope left and no money so im gonna be in for a rude awakening when i switch back to kratom..........

​

&#x200B;

I still want to get clean. All I want is ibogaine treatment which probably isnt going to happen anytime soon, so ill stay a dopehead until then

​

To be continued.............

Basically I had the typical story of starting on hydrocodone and oxy and eventually graduating to heroin and now I’ve been on subs for 6 months. I really quite enjoyed being on the subs if I’m being honest but I’m moving across the country to get a new job and I have to quit before then. Basically what I want to know is, about how long will it take for this feeling of absolute boredom to go away? Every single day I just feel like I can’t enjoy a single thing and I just feel so depressed and uninterested in everything. I know the physical withdrawl will end in about a week, but how long do the mental effects typically take to start getting better? Keep in mind I was only seriously addicted to heroin for about a year and a half before I switched to subs but it would seem I’m hyper-sensitive to addiction because even when I was only doing 30 mg hydrocodone every day I was still so deep in it and quitting seemed like an impossible feat. But now I really have no choice, because I can’t get anything out there. It’s gonna be hard leaving my home and everything I’ve ever known and I feel like the mental effects of withdrawl is going to make it unbearable. Oh and just for some perspective I’m only on my 1st day clean but I know how it is because I’ve ran out many times in the past. I warned myself down to like one 8th of a suboxone every day before I quit. So, in your opinion, how long do you think the mental aspect will last?

Is IV worthwhile or should I stick to insufflated? Would prep with a micron filter for harm reduction purposes. 

&#x200B;

For the record I know many people think it is not enjoyable to take bupe but take it from me, an opiate addict for just about two decades now that has had very little clean time and had a high tolerance to iv heroin and pharms, if you let your tolerance drop enough low doses of bupe can be very enjoyable. Not in the I'm nodding out all day but definitely a good buzz. Been doing it for about a year now so please don't post to tell me its not possible or unsustainable to get a bupe buzz for more than a month. It is if you space out your doses by at least every other day and keep doses below 2mg a day, preferably 1mg a day you can maintain the buzz. Ideally I try and take 1 mg a day or less and only use once or twice a week. Been going strong this way since I was locked up. Know plenty of junkies who made the switch in prison and enjoy it plenty. Many who have done so for years.

&#x200B;

So please, people who have both snorted and iv'ed their bupe, which do you prefer for getting a buzz and why?",1535682752.0

I feel like I have the flu but obviously as we all know and despise this is the caveat that opiates inherently carry. 

Its been 3 years of opiates now so far. These are sourced from my regular gp who knows a fair amount about chronic pain. I have problems with sciatica, herniated discs in my lower back, narrowing discs in my neck and signs of spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease all shown on my MRI I waited about a year to get. This was my second MRI. 

Admittedly I'm dependant and borderline addicted at the time however because I had not found alternatives for my pain  I relied on opiates way too heavily and my drug use in general became obscene to a point I seriously couldn't even actually perceive who I actually was and all my identity centered around substances. 

Basically I became a psychonaut I guess you could say but not with psychedelics but addictive substances making me no better then a hardcore junkie. But I digress that's enough backstory. 

Shakily I walk back to my room and pull out my pill crusher and a 40mg oxycontin and 10 percocet. Twist the pill crusher and dump out the white powder and grab a pen and hollow out its contents so I can insufflate. Then grab a card and line up the powder into two trails. Each one is delivered up one nostril and I then down some water with the 10 percs. I also decide to grab one of my 2mg clonazepams and put it under my tongue then proceed to smoke a snap out of my bong. 

At this point I'm feeling extremely euphoric but still stable and functional and go outside to check the mail as I have a darknet order I have been waiting on. I grab the key unsure if it will be there and find four pieces of lettermail addressed to me. Inside one of them just encloses the drugs in a greeting card and a simple plastic bag. Suffices for domestic orders really. This order contains 1 gram of pure acetyl fentanyl. I ordered this based on my tolerance being excessively high, also for if I get cut off my prescriptions and wanting to conserve some of my pharma opiates as they never seem to last the full month before my next appointment to refill 60 40mg oxycontin, 30 2mg clonazepam and 100 10mg oxy or 200 percocet ( A few months before my doctor was actually writing for 300 percocet a month which was insane)depending on what he feels like writing. The next envelope is more secure and uses a vacuum seal and a moisture barrier bag. This contains 1 gram of pure powder shiny crystalline looking etizolam. I ordered this to make my clonazepam go farther or if I get cut off. Next envelope contains a gram of mxe as currently at the time this is my favorite drug. On top of that I also receive a gram of rock MDMA in the last envelope for my girlfriend. 

I leave these drugs at home because I need to see my doctor as its refill day. Everything is fine and he fills them without any questions or concerns really and I head home. Once I get home I have a small line of the fentalogue and pass out waking up to my girlfriend coming in the room. She comments on how I was sleeping strangely and look sort of out of it. However she knows I take prescriptions and order things off the onion fields. She has had a hard day doing residential cleaning and though she is not much of a drug user takes an ativan for her anxiety and I show her the MDMA that looks like a chunk of glass almost. She decides to take a couple points and eventually her eyes roll into the back of her head and she is nodding just not the way we all know and love. 

Through the night I use mxe and etizolam and also have 1 beer and we watch movies and listen to music and have sex. We stay up all night long and eventually we can see the sunlight coming in the room and at this point we are dead tired and my girlfriend goes outside for a cigarette. I realize I'm not much opiated anymore and have a line of acetyl fentanyl. This is where everything goes black and I don't remember anything.",1535658790.0

I figured, okay sure, I'll come by while she's at work and throw away the miscellaneous shit I know she doesn't want. I smoked a joint and brought some trash bags.

Here comes the fuck up.

I threw away a bottle of aspirin that was sitting under my mom's basement cabinet. I opened it and checked, and it was for sure the yellow aspirin that I know my dad takes for his heart. The lighting in the bathroom is kind of weird and I saw that the pills were kind of off but I didn't think anything of it. I thought maybe the coating had melted off a little because of the heat.

Well here comes the fucking realization. 

15 fucking years ago, I watched my mom take my grandmothers M boxes and shove them in an aspirin bottle. I only remember this because I asked my mom ""why does gram have to take so much medicine?"" And my mom explained that pain medicine was helping her deal with a botched surgery and whatever, and that she just had another surgery, and yada yada.

GUYS I THREW AWAY AT LEAST 10 FUCKING 40MG OXYS AND BROUGHT THE FUCKING BAG TO THE DUMP. I MIGHT BE THE DUMBEST MOTHERFUCKER ON THE EAST COAST.

Also fuck my mom for stealing 10 mboxes and not using them, BUT FUCK ME MORE FOR THROWING THEM AWAY

Edit: I just realized the slang might be confusing here. Generally where I am ""mboxes"" refer to any opiate with an m in a box. Idk if this is a local thing or whatever. I'm specifically referring to yellow oxys printed with M 595. They're 40mg each.",1535654574.0

9bk2rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9bk2rt/uldn_and_opioid_tolerance/,6,https://redd.it/9bk2rt,InfiniteEyes0609,ULDN and opioid tolerance,"I thought I'd make an official post about this since it may help someone in the future.  The first thing to note is that I've achieved these results with Kratom.

A little background.  I had been taking Kratom for a couple of years.  I took 6g per day, split into 2 doses of 3g.  I never once felt bad on this dosing regimen; never woke up sweating or feeling moody.  I could go 12 hours between doses pretty easily.  At this point, Kratom did not interfere in my life one bit.

Then I tried tianeptine.  After my first real big dose of tianeptine sulfate, I found out Kratom no longer worked on me, so I was stuck using tia to fight off withdrawals.  After 7 weeks of tia use and abuse, I jumped and haven't looked back since.  It's been over 3 months now, and I developed such hate for it that I haven't craved it once, not even when I found an old NM container with some...I didn't hesitate to throw it out.

After this I had to take about 20g of Kratom per day to feel fine, and now I had to dose every 4 to 6 hours.  Needless to say, this dosing scheme sucked and it did interfere with my life.  I started to look at all the ways I could reverse my tolerance.  I learned about proglumide but couldn't get any.  I learned about memantine and got some but it seems like it was bunk, as I've taken big (150mg) doses of it and not felt the slightest thing.  I'm waiting on some more memantine from a different source and will post my results with that.  I've been taking 30mg DXM every night before bed.  

Then starting about 6 days ago I began taking ULDN (Ultra Low Dose Naltrexone).  I bought some LDN drops and further diluted these drops in distilled water.  I made a solution that was 50ug of naltrexone per ml, or roughly 2.5ug per drop.  The first day I took 2 drops, or 5ug.  The second day I took 1ml, or 50ug.  The third day I took 100ug, the fourth day I took 250ug, and the fifth day I took 500ug, or 0.5mg, and last night I took 250ug.  Before starting ULDN I had been able to taper my 20gpd of Kratom to about 13gpd in 3 or 4 doses thoughout the day.  Then, magically, on day 4 of my ULDN experiment I took 3g in the morning and 3g in the afternoon and all of a sudden I could dose 6gpd like before and go 12 hours without dosing.

My plan is to stay here for a few days and continue cutting.  I post this in case it can help someone with tianeptine, as I've already read various studies that say chronic administration of ULDN along with an opioid agonist may reverse tolerance, shorten the acute withdrawal period, and attenuate the expression of any withdrawal symptoms.  I'm hoping this would work with tia and any other opiod as well. 

TL;DR:  Tianeptine ruined my tolerance so bad that my usual kratom dose of 6gpd split into 2 doses 12 hours apart became 20gpd split into 4 doses 5 hours apart.  After a few days of taking Ultra Low Dose Naltrexone, I was able to go back to my old dosing schedule and could once more go 12 hours without dosing.  I'm hoping these results translate to tianeptine and other opiods and may help others taper and quit in the future.",1535639190.0

I'm in it for the long haul.,"Currently sitting in my parents bathroom as I am typing this, at 6am on August 30th, 2018. Just did the last of my dope. My bags are packed. I'm officially moving out in two hours. Away from this place, where I can take a short 15minute drive to pick up my favorite drugs, crack and heroin, sold out in the open on the street, in front of passerbys, in front of cars driving by, and in front of cops parked at the corner, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, no appointments necessary, no connections necessary, and no phone calls necessary, for as little as $7. It's a really run down, stereotypical looking trap spot, a spot you'd see ina rap music video. A very short drive from my nice looking, upper class neighborhood. A place that'd seem scary to a lot of people, though a place I enjoy driving to, being in, and using in, where people I don't even recognize know me by name run up to me and ask me what I need. It's an odd type of place one would enjoy the environment of, however what I really loved about it was the drugs. 






Starting out as a Heroin addict 6 years ago at the age of 18, I'd never imagined a place where the drugs were SO easily and readily accessible and available. It was a dream I didn't know I had. My time is finally up though. It's time to leave before I end up dead or in prison. I was officially taken off supervised probation a little over a week ago, and my parents and I had been planning this move. I HAVE to leave. There's no other option. Rehab didn't work. Suboxone didn't work. Functional use is not possible [for me]. I've done this before, 3 or 4 times to be exact, quitting. The longest I made it was almost two years. The issue I have here is the accessibility. Once I leave I am thoroughly confident that I can surpass 2 years and longer of clean time. The place I am moving to is states away, a small town almost in the middle of no where, away from that toxic yet seemingly graceful environment disguised by the wonderful rush of dopamine the drugs gave you. 





Taking me in is my brother. Oddly, it seems like fate, we had only reconnected after being separated for over 15 years, on Christmas of 2015. I visited him at the place I'm moving to and when it came time to, I did not want to leave. It is a beautiful place, with a beautiful beach just a drive away as short as the one I'd take daily to buy drugs. My brother and I have so much in common its almost like we lived the same life. We have only seen each other 3 or 4 times since we'd separated, yet are closer than my father and I who I Iived with for all 24 years of my life, who just yesterday asked me what my girlfriend's name was. A girl I had been seeing for over a year and a half. I never fully grasped how estranged we were until he had asked me this. Our relationship, which was never close in the first place, is permanently ruined through my drug use. I've stolen thousands of dollars worth of things from him and my mother, so it is absolutely understandable that they are kicking me out, however it is in the most gentle way possible, and in a way that is helping me. I never deserved the number of chances they gave me in the first place. For all of that and this last bit of help they are giving me, I am truly grateful.

No idea how I'm going to stay awake at work today.,"So, I didn't sleep much Monday or Tuesday night from doing opiates. I was super sleepy at work yesterday and could barely hold my eyes open. Told my boss I had not been able to sleep the previous night and used PTO to leave at noon. The plan was to go home and take a long ass nap, and get plenty of sleep last night. But then of course a curve ball is thrown my way. Dboy texts me as I'm driving home and says he got some new product. So stupid me bought a bag, figuring if I used it mid afternoon it wouldn't affect my sleep. Well despite being tired as fuck last night I only slept a few hours. 

I've had multiple cups of coffee, and three Vivarin tablets (caffeine pills). I feel like I should be wired as I'm already pretty sensitive to caffeine. I'm barely able to hold my eyes open sitting here at my desk. And the worst part is that I have to help a colleague work on building an app today, so I can't leave early. I also had planned a first meet/date after work. Fuck me. 

Is it possible to be so tired that no amount of caffeine will actually help? Like I feel my eyes are so tired that nothing is going to make them alert and wide open. ",1535634083.0

""Hey man, get off me "" I heard like an annoying conscious voice inside of my own head,
     ""What the fuck?? ""
      I scanned my surroundings, realizing what had just happened and quickly faced the window folding my arms and cradling my head Into the left arm of my seat as I dozed off again into my last great slumber .
     4 and a half hours before that very moment,  I snapped awake with the SWOOSH of water splashing my face , I scanned cautiously, realizing again , ""Fuck, not in the shower again, I could've drowned or something, Eh, who gives a shit anyways "" , I laughed quietly under my breath to myself, knowing death wasn't anywhere close.
      ""C, TURN THE FUCKING SHOWER OFF AND FINISH GETTING READY, YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE FOR THE PLANE !!""
      The euphoria I was experiencing quickly fading into a suttle anger that didn't faze me, but rushed the intoxicated slowness of my walk when it came to getting shit done period. 
      "" Just putting clothes on! I'll be out in less than 5 minutes!"" 
      I heard no reply , but at this point my parents knew what was up, knew that 5 minutes NEVER actually means 5 minutes nod time, no more time could be wasted , as my phone glistened with the codensation of the warm vapor flowing throughout the entirety of my small suburban bathroom. 1 line lay protruding from the opaque , glistened screen. Quickly, I grabbed my small-cut straw and inhaled quicker than I would at the last second arising from the depths of a dive into a pool, ""the dying fight for air"" , Threw my clothing on, hair in a bun, ready to have an exciting plane experience! 
      This was absolutely incorrect, I ran upstairs into my room, knowing my room would be searched upon leaving , i had to find somewhere good , it was my only chance , Think, Think, C , where could she not look,  where the fuck should i.... "" "" OH SHIT, PERFECT!"" I then put about .2 (What I had left), into a piece of parchment paper and stuck it in a candle with a silver lid atop it's cylinder fixture. 
      ""WAIT"" my mind screamed as I almost exited my room, ""I need just a little more , just a little bit "" , My brain had the best of me at this point.
      I grabbed my straw once again,  lifting the chrome lid,  then , while opening the parchment paper carefully I noticed a good amount of powder along with the rocks , perfect , just to stick the straw in and get all the powder... a second later all the powder was gone, leaving a few rocks (one maybe being gone may have snorted a rock along with it I'm not sure ), vision, increasingly fading to grey , then back to normal , then back to grey , I threw the lid onto the candle , stuffed it into a box and wobbled out of my room , barely conscious,  I walked out   of my house towards my car, parents waiting to drive me , slowly fading to black as I reach the seat of the car ... ""C?"" 
""C?"" "" We're here!! ""

So in the last 6 months ive basically maintained on loperamide at about an average dose of 100mgs a day sometimes more sometimes less. 
     In this 6 months I developed a bad benzo addiction which I've since stopped as of a month ago, but I can't give up lope even tho I know its terrible for me, and I'm just tired of keeping up a dope habit, so I'm stuck on lope, however I chip occasionally sometimes with dope/fent lately its been with oxy( ir oxy not shitty neos) anyway the past 6 times I've tried to get high on oxy I barely even feel it at all.
  I figured it was because I wasn't doing enough even tho my tolerance should be pretty fucking low, last nite I snorted 130mgs of 100% real oxy no presses or anything I know its fucking real and I barely even got a head change I got a little body high but I thought i should feel pretty Damn good from it, now ive tried slamming it and eating it and all of them have been pretty much the same I felt iv decent but not like I feel i shoulda.
   So ive basically given up on getting high for rite now but if some one with a little more knowledge about body chemistry please give me some input about this shit. And I'm just gonna go ahead and say this because I already know some one is gonna be like oh but loperamide doesn't cross the bbb so your just psyching yourself out and this doesn't make sense, regardless of what Wikipedia says I know at least some of it does becausr when I don't takr it I get withdrawals like any other opiate and ive used it when I was dope sick as Fuck shooting Damn near a ball a day and it got rid of 90 percent of my withdrawals.

I know klnopin is addicting, but I’ve been on that for 15 years for severe panic attacks. 

I had just thought or heard GABA could mimic opiates or something.  Which was odd since he could see my old suboxone  scripts, and still prescribed it.

9bbpok,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9bbpok/my_father_the_opioid_crusader_self_story_i_know/,33,https://redd.it/9bbpok,PablaEscobar,"My father the opioid crusader... self story, i know ill be judged for, but ...","So  my father has recently developed a heart condition, and my mom needs surgery on her eyes, 

My father has always trashed me. He callsme a druggie, and everything else, even though ive only used Suboxone and Klonopin at very low doseages, and am at my lowest doseages ever, i dont get why he has the gall to be like this to me.

I chose not to go to my MRI with him based on all the things hes said to me, and made fun of me, i am truthfully scared that he will try to have me committed to a psychiatric facility because he doesn't like it when im in pain and considers it a psychiatric problem.

Meanwhile, his heart problem is entirely ""real"" (even though theres no evidence)


He is totally against all opioids including suboxone. I hurt , myself, trying to talk to him. I do not have a choice . 

You can call me a bitch, whatever, but im not in a physical state where i can move out, as well as support myself, as well as take care of my pain problems.



So i guess my question would be, how do i speak to my father about pain in a way that he will understand? My father grew up in the Bronx and he is very hard headed and thinks everything that he ""thinks"" is based in reality and fact, and everything anyone else says , even if it comes from a doctor, is untrue.

I do wish to get along with him, but i also feel he also he underlying conditions, maybe bipolar disorder. He will go off and scream at things for no reason . no reason whatsoever.


When i was younger i believe my MOTHER would make fun of my father after he had cancer saying he was a pill popper (this was over 20 yrs ago)

All the things that have happened to me come back to haunt me everytime my father is obnoxious to me. 

in year 2000 i had my ass kicked by my older brother whom i had not seen  in over a year. i was speaking to my mother on the phone, asking her where is $5 as i had just come home from the fair and wanted to get something to eat . My brother gets on the phone, drunk, cusses me out, threatens me, hangs up, 

I walk out my back door, lock the door, and the motherfucker pulled up in the backyard, lol, oops, i effectively locked myself out.


my brother beat me up for over two hours . i was screaming for someone to call the police but nobody heard me due to the noise of the fair which is diagonally across the street . 

when my parents came home, they could not stop him, and were not calling the police. at that point, i pulled out a knife, and he proceeded to spear me through a tree/bush , and i stabbed him a little bit (not much, but enough to make him keep punching my lights out ) {in that moment i knew that if i could show my parents what hes doing to me i knew that i would be the better person so to speak so i began laughing while he was punching me}

My father took the knife an threw it in the woods

My mother lied to the police,
I got taken to jail,

5 hrs pass and my parents come to pick me up, as obviously my brother wasnt going to press charges

My brother is a professional bodybuilder, he is very strong in comparison to me  or anyone really . 

After that, is when i began my ""real drug use"" i.e. taking suboxone and oxy 80s . 


When my brother beat me up, i had detoxed, cold turkey, from 32mg of Suboxone due to the fact i was being over-dosed . I did it the hard way, as my kidneys were causing water retention in my feet i was scared i was going to die.


Theres more to the story but

I can't really talk to my father anymore, and everything gets blamed on me, no matter what. My father treats me as if i am subhuman because i use suboxone and used to take pain meds. 

Yes, i had an addicton, over 10 years ago

But now i have intense pain and that doesnt give him a reason to not only treat me like shit, but treat my mother like shit.


my father has continuously called the police on me because i will not take his bullshit anymore. the same things that he does to me, he does to my mother, and i really need my mom, as she is the only one i can truthfully talk to . However, she cannot drive very far . And i cannot drive due to the pain i am in.


Overall i am in a very shitty situation and each person involved is suffering because of it .

i want to kill myself in one way, but in another way, i just wish people would be nice and not have an agenda . i just dont want to be in pain anymore. i have tried a lot of things, all NSAIDS, etc... accupuncture, chiro, phys therapy (my Dr. told me NOT to go back.)

my mother tells him to be nice to me, and he says hes going to beat her up and throw her out .


i have records of some of this as he threatens me everyother day


my father and i also run a business together that i developed from the ground up 10 years ago. while i am appreciative for his great help i also want a father that i can simply talk to without him getting agravated. Who teh fuck screams over meaningless shit? Like me asking him to help me move something, or while im doing the dishes he is screaming at me ""im wasting water"".


i would l ike to get counseling/help but i also dont want to be blamed .


My mom wants us all to get along but doesnt follow through with truthfully getting us all help, and ive been in pain for 8 years or more , and its now radiating into other areas of my body and getting worse and all i am looking for is fucking help and i get destroyed .


Yes, i yell and scream, but thats because i think about all the shit that my father has said to me , and i wish that he was just nicer, i know he has it in him, 
But he was also abused by my mother's parents. Which i guess he thinks gives him the right to shit on my mother and i day in and day out


He thinks that i am brainwashed , and i was brainwashed to ""hate him"" by my grandmother and aunt.

This part is partially true unfortunately . My grandma and aunt are in the divorcee club, and i had to stay there when i was very young. They would say to me ""repeat after me""

""Your father is wacko jacko"" (which is what was popular at the time)

""Your father is OJ""


Then we would drive past the bar, and we would see a truck at the bar, that looked like my fathers, they would point and laugh and says ""Look, theres your father at the bar!"" and i would say to them ""No, thats not his truck""

They would go ""yes it is"" ... thinking i am too young to know better, so yes , my father was shitted on.

My mother left my father two or three times when i was younger, as above, i was forced to stay with them. 

My mothers reasoning for this , is that, he wasnt nice to me, and was beginning to become physically abusive, one time throwing me across the room for touching the mousepad.


My father will frequently bring up opiates and drugs to draw us into having an arguement with him. and with my mother he will bring up things about her mother and father just to draw us into arguing with him.



The only time i felt my father was truthfully nice to me in this past year was a week or two ago when he thought he had a heart problem.


Im stuck.


My suboxone Dr. is 2 hrs away


I am not CURRENTLY in need of suboxone, but in the future i will be, and the car ride hurts my neck and jaw so fucking bad that i vomit several times on the way there and the way back . 

my father has called the police on me for no reason, after drawing us into arguing with him . then my mother gets flustered and doesnt know what to say or do with the police officers so she usually just tells them ""well my son was yelling because he doesnt feel well""

Then i do this song and dance with the police officers where they try to force me togo to a mental institution . Its fucking hilarious TBH especially when i get these PO noobs , i just fuck with them at this point. My father doesnt care to be nice. he just doesnt care..


But the problem with this is that the nervousness is causing me not to eat, i have lost 40 lbs since the start of 2018 and my blood tests are coming back good so far . Why am i losing so much weight when i cant even fucking move around?


if you have any questions about my situation ask them, as i need all the help i can get.

I plan to admit myself to a counselor or psychologist as i have nobody to really talk to as my mother pow-wows with my father because my father says he will beat her up and throw her out .... its sickening, just sickening . 


i just want my dad to be nice. if he was nice, theres a chance my pain would be greatly reduced. i would be less nervous, i would move around more , and be a little more social . 

Maybe i wouldnt need any medicine at all ,

But he is just a pompous ass. He also, thinks, now that Donald Trump is president, that he can get away with more of this type of abuse.


I understand that he doesnt like me taking suboxone or whatever, and that i had a hard time when i was younger, but jesus christ, if he has a heart problem, how can he scream for 12 hours a day?

He claims that ""he  knows what i am looking for""
and that ""you only want opiates""
as another one of his gimmicks to draw us into arguing with him.

So now when i get my MRI - if theres nothing on it - its free game for him to run his mouth about how all my pain is psychological rather than physical .............. im sad . i just wanna be happy tbh

im not really depressed, i just need a little easier life, i.e not driving 2 hrs to acquire a suboxone script.

I am looking for local  sub doctors, but i dont wanna pay $700 introduction fee..
And not only that, im not truthfully sure that it even helps me with my pain at all , i have to even feel nervous when im taking them becaue my father hates everything besides nicotine and alcohol...................


Suggestions? (besides moving out, id lose my business.... and i wouldnt have any help for pain .)

anyone been in this position before?


When i wake up at night, sometimes i scream, because of the pain, it is very hard for me to go back to sleep, as my neck gets extremely swollen if i get up and down several times. i feel bad that i have to wake my mother up for a neckrub, and it is all wareing on me. 

Im also blamed for all problems that they have. anything and everything. I don't smoke, yet im blamed for his walls being yellow . ....


Somewhere in my father is a good person....

My mom doesnt know shit about computers, but she wants to help me, she doesnt really know how, as she works, and my father doesnt . its hard . its also weird. my mother sleeps in the fucking livingroom... for a long , long, long time now. When iw as younger, my mother would jump out of the car and run away. my mother would run away at night time which caused me to sleep with her at night because i was scared she would leave me . 

so basically, my father blames my mother, and my mother blames me because she doesnt have anyone to blame. 

honestly, i think my mother enjoys being abused . shes like subserviant to it . its weird. she wont do ANYTHING to help their own personal martial issues  . because she likes it. my father told me she was abused when she was young, and then she goes on to tell us about how her father would drag her up the stairs by her hair . 

Im going to be 30 in a few days. My dad is 70. my mom is 61.



My father has a friend that overdosed, died, and was revived on the operating table. This dude is obese like 500lbs and was taking like 500mg of morphine a day. 

He literally would rather that i kill myself than have an opioid for pain.

I have been prescribed weak opioids for pain, i have NOT tried getting aNYTHING at all yet. I WILL BE, in the future, especially if this negative attitude of theirs does not cease . my mother only supports my father because my father will do things , like, when they take a ride to get a pizza, he wont let her out of the car until hes finished yelling at her, and i see them driving around the block several times.


So yea, pops is super anti-drug, anti-opiates . i swear to god imma tap his morphine line when he gets ill . just kidding. 

My mom is very nice, but she allows this to go on...


I feel really badbecause she feels bad .


Sometimes its very hard for me to shutup because ive been in pain for so long and ahve been dicked around by many physicians due to being on suboxone . in a way its the greatest drug ever, on the other hand you get treated as if you're sub-human. even by your own father.",1535566157.0

Early 2000s, oxycotin booming. It is very easy to obtain in large amounts, in some cases, multiple scripts from multiple doctors. Millions of people get hooked, recreationaly or for legit pain. 

9/11 happens, we invade Afghanistan. Many people use painkillers to cope with with loved ones going off to war, or ones that died in terror attacks. As well as emotional pain from loss of jobs. I know personally many peoples lives fell apart after the terror attacks just because of the scary state of the country at the time and it triggered mental illness in them, and used drugs to cope with that.
___________________________________

Afghanistan, one of the biggest heroin producers in the world, is a country we are still occupying today. Many argue we shouldn't even be there anymore. We start seeing a flood of heroin in the country like never before, and the DEA starts cracking down on pharma painkillers.

People losing their huge scripts of painkillers make the jump to heroin as they can no longer get it/or as much legally. As time goes by, fentanyl laced heroin starts to become way too common, and the DEA continues to crack down on legal opiates so much that doctors are scared to prescribe it, and are even worried about the DEA looking into the scripts they've been prescribing for years to their patients and end up cutting it down, if not cut it off completely. 

Now, we have the biggest opiate epidemic we've ever seen in the United States.

My question is, was this all planned to happen like this? I can't understand how this would all be a big coincidence. I can only come to the conclusion of this being some sort of population control. Similar to the theories in the 70s and 80s with the DEA in Columbia cracking down on cocaine, then seeing a flood of crack in the 80s

Now I drive for a living so I've become cocky as shit. Driving with Netflix playing and redditing. And yesterday it almost killed me.

Currently im staying with my parents in a beach town an hour from a major CA city. So we get tons of traffic round 5.

Me being the dumbass I am I was cooking down that freeway social d sings about, looking at my phone when in my peripherals I see stopped traffic. Like a fucking cat I jam the brakes and a swerve into the shoulder.

Thank God I was in the fast lane and that there even was a shoulder, let alone a clean one.

Unfortunately, all sorts of lights lit up. Ebrake light is stuck on, two other brake lights, and my VSC light. But I'll be damned if that story doesn't end in me completing the run.

Marijuana: So yesterday i tried smoking some bud after smoking H. Boy was i off my nut. If people could share their experience with mixing these two I’d love to hear it. Personally I was way more fucked than i thought i would be, I was kinda freaking out for a couple hours. This is the second time i’ve mixed the two, the first time i definitely noticed the enhanced effects of H, but yesterday it felt more like very enhanced effects from both ends, don’t know if i’ll try the two again. Gotta say on the flip side of the peak, I experienced some really beautiful feelings. Overall a very bittersweet high.

Xanax: I was originally enticed by the mix as i heard it enhances the nod with the negative of having Xanax take away the euphoria. 100% DID enhance the nod, which sounds great but the euphoria (not necessarily turned to dysphoria), but with the intense nods not being euphoric it felt almost pointless in my opinion, won’t be mixing the two again.

Any drugs people have mixed with H with good experiences? I’m looking to enhance the experience of H without messing with the high too much. ",1535516785.0

So I luckily got my first paycheck today from my new job. I had enough in my sack to last me a little bit longer than today, but of course I had to celebrate the fact that I could go get more. So I finished that little bit and finished up all I had to do at work in order to get off and hit up the ATM. Everything is going smooth, traffic was sweet, was feeling real good the whole way down to the city, and I had finished work at the perfect time for my plug to open up shop himself. So I make it to see him, go in and get a free cookie and lemonade and grab my sack and I'm on the way back in less than 10 minutes of making it into the city. Well it's been a tradition that before I leave I gotta find a safe place to either park or a single toilet bathroom that locks and gives me privacy. So I've found a gas station that has this and I always stop at it before I hop back on the interstate. Well as I pull in and park I see a girl looking a bit rough just sitting there up against the building. She was wearing some Dark John Lennon looking sun glasses so I couldn't see her eyes, but judging how her body was reacting you could tell she was nodding. So I go in, buy a scratch off and ask for the bathroom key, do my business and walk out. I don't smoke in my car so I'm outside in the shade near her and the building smoking a cigarette. I heard a guy, that had the look of someone who used, hollering a name and she wasn't responding, not only because nodding but because it wasn't her name. So he walks up and asks if she's alright and stuff and ask me if she's ok I'm like I dunno I'm not with her I'm just smoking a cig and about to head back home. So he finally gets a response from her and he asks again if she's okay she just says yeah I'm just a bit sick. So he sits his snack cake and drink down and says don't let anything happen to my stuff and he walks in the store. As he walks out to get his stuff he tossed her down a bag and said here it ain't much but it should help. I got his attention as he took off walking and said bruh that's what's up man, that shits cool as a fucking fan. He said yeah man it's the way it is, you just gotta give and let the cycle do its thing and good karma. So after that she asked me if I had a spare cigarette and I obliged and I stood there smoking and having a conversation with her. She was intelligent and knew about bioavailability but she mentioned something about BTH and how it has a good bioavailability of swallowing it  and I was like no no no. Don't swallow the H. She didn't know what boofing or plugging was though. I told her to check out reddit if she ever got her phone working again. It's just cool to see someone getting blessed like that outta nowhere. 

 
Side note, I love my plug as far as being prompt and professional in the business, he takes great caution in making sure we're not sitting around in the hood all day looking suspicious and getting eyeballed by the police. Ain't it funny that the only time white people are racially profiled is when they are in the hood buying drugs? Like come on that's not fair...

Before you ask, no I didn't want to chance doing a hand off of drugs to someone I didn't know for one and other things considering my given situation that I personally am in. I don't care to share and I'm not a completely greedy person, but I was still technically in the hood and had to be safe and yeah...

​​
​​Diane didn’t look like a crack head. Sure, she was short and overweight and her age showed. I always imagined she was somewhere in her mid fifties. She showed me pictures of herself from her younger days and she had been drop dead gorgeous, once upon a time when weed was Moroccan and pants had bell bottom legs. Now she was an old cape battleaxe. Her voice was low and raspy from years of smoking Newport 100s. I’m sure all the crack smoke played a part too. But underneath all that pudge and the hard leathery skin was a big heart. Diane cared about people. And when she learned I was homeless the night I met her, smoking coke in her car with reggie driving around Hyannis, she immediately offered me a place to live. Diane had been homeless in Hyannis years before, but she had never forgotten her roots, so to speak. She had lifted herself out of the street and into a life in a beautiful 4 bedroom house that she shared with 3 older men, all of whom had also been homeless at one point or another. It was a strange arrangement but somehow they seemed to make it work. 

​​Diane took me to Ocean State Job Lot the very next day after I met her and bought me a $20 twin airmatress that we setup at the foot of her bed in her bedroom. She washed pillows and a big plushie purple blanket for me to use, and that blanket was the warmest fucking blanket I’ve ever had the pleasure of sleeping under in my life. It almost made me forget the absolute disaster my life had become. 

​​Diane and I started to run together, and people noticed. Everywhere her white Chevy went, I was usually in it, riding shotgun. We got high together, daily. She drove me to reup when I started making moves, and to hit sales when I needed to move work. I fucked with Diane the long way, even if I never actually fucked her. She was good people.
​​For example, I had been living on Diane’s bedroom floor for a few days when, one night, I slipped into her bathroom around 1am. She was snoring on her bed, sound asleep. I had been waiting for her to pass out because she hated that I shot dope. But like any good heroin addict will tell you, I had no choice in the matter. The methadone clinic was in Yarmouth off exit 6, but it might has well have been non-existent. I had no transportation of my own, and there was no public bus route to speak of. So I was shooting dope, even if Diane didn’t want me to. Like I said, I didn’t have much choice in the matter.

​​Anyway, I got myself into her bathroom, which she had exclusive rights to, I locked the door, making sure the exhaust fan was running to muffle any noise I might make. To anyone else I hoped it would sound like I was just taking a shit. I got my heroin out and prepped a nice size shot, one I had been waiting many hours to do. I sat myself on the toilet, tied my arm off, and then…. nothing. Deep, black, silent bliss. I don’t even remember actually injecting the shot.

​​
​​When I came to, or better said, woke up, Diane was standing over me, shaking my arm. 

​​“Oh my god, you scared the SHIT out of me!” she barked as I tried to get my bearings. My neck ached and I realized I was pretzeled in between the wall and the toilet I had been sitting on when I did my shot. The needle was still in my arm, hanging out of my skin, a long trail of blood down my forearm and wrist. 

​​“I thought you weren’t shooting up anymore!” she exclaimed as I removed the needle from my arm and dragged myself up and out from in between the wall and the toilet. 
​​I couldn’t help but laugh a little at myself as I began apologizing to her. 

​​“Look, I’m really sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.” I offered meekly, turning on my best puppy dog eyes. Diane was so good to me. I hated deceiving her. But heroin addiction isn’t about impulse control like cocaine addiction is, at least not all of it. Diane understood cocaine addiction. We smoked a lot of coke together, we bonded over it. But her knowledge of opiate addiction was limited, like most people. 

​​“Well what will it take for you to stop shooting up? Because I can’t have you overdosing here, I care about you too much to find you dead.” she asked as I cleaned up my shooting kit and washed the blood off my arm. 

​​“I mean the only thing I know of that works is methadone. But the clinic is in Yarmouth, and I would have to go every morning, 7 days a week without fail. It’s a giant commitment.”
​​”We will go there in the morning” she countered without a single second of hesitation. “If I take you will you promise not to shoot heroin anymore? Not shoot anything at all anymore?”
​​”Fucking absolutely” I said. And she did exactly that. She took me to the clinic day in and day out, 7 days a week, from that day forward until we had a falling out, months later. While I lived with Diane I kept my promise. She took me to the clinic, I never missed a single day. She was a fucking angel to me. She never complained about having to take me. Eventually she let me start driving her car, her sleeping in the passenger seat, to the clinic and back. She never even asked me to reimburse her for the gas we used. In a very real sense, I owe Diane more than I could ever repay. 

​​
​​ 
​​Anyway, Diane used to volunteer at the soup kitchen. She pretty much ran it, actually. So I’d ride with her to dinner almost every night, and by doing so, I began to get to know a lot of the homeless crowd in Hyannis. 
​​Diane introduced me to everyone. People would look at me a little funny, trying to figure out if Diane and I were fucking, but they quickly made their own realizations. It was obvious. I was not romantically involved with Diane. And to her credit, Diane never tried to be romantic with me. She was just a true friend. At least until the drugs got in the way, like they always do.
​​
One person I met was a lady we will call Joan, mostly because I have forgotten her name.
​​I ended up at Joan’s tiny efficiency apartment one night that spring, hanging out with her sniffing her xanax and smoking coke while she got hammered on natural ice cans. Eventually her beer ran out, and she began to tell me how her next door neighbor was out of town, but that he had beer in his fridge. She convinced me that she had permission to go in his apartment and get the beer, but had lost the door key. And then she convinced me to break in. 
​​I was never into that type of shit, breaking and entering. It felt wrong to me. I always imagined what I would feel like if it was my place being pilfered. But I had been sniffing xanax, so I was in that dissassociated haze that comes with large amounts of benzodiazipines. For some reason, when I take benzos, the person I become is nothing like the person I am sober. Its like Dr Jekyl and Mr Hyde, it really is that much of a dramatic change. I am not proud of some of the decisions I’ve made in a benzo-induced stupor, and this is one of them.

​​At Joan’s behest, I first went to the front door, which was literally right next to her front door. It was the corner unit, in a single story building that stretched along the property. It must have been a small motel at some point, but now they rented the rooms out as a year-round efficiencies. 

​​The front door was locked, so I went back in to Joan’s room and she continued to prod me, working me up to the point that I went back outside, determined to get in this apartment. I didnt even really want to, but again, xanax. 

​​I found the bathroom window in the back of the building, and a stray empty bucket laying against the foundation. The bucket was my step ladder. I went back into Joans room again and found a roll of duct tape. Back outside, I taped over the bottom pane of the bathroom window, and then with a single punch, I knocked the pane glass out and all over the bathroom sink and floor. The duct tape didnt do shit.
​​I’m not a small man by any metric, but I somehow made it through that tiny bathroom window and into the apartment without a single cut from all the broken glass strewn across the bathroom.
​​Inside, I first made sure I had not tripped any alarms. I then opened the fridge, grabbed a case of cold beer, and walked out the front door, back to Joan, handing her the beer. 

​​“I’ll be right back” I mumbled, as I walked back out. 
​​“Dont take anything else!” Joan commanded, but I wasnt listening. Now, I was going to get something I wanted too. It seemed only right. I dont drink.

​​Inside, I found a filing cabinet. It was locked, but I found the key in about 30 seconds, and opened it up. Immediately, I knew what I had found when I saw the blue plastic case inside. 

​​“FIREARM” I screamed silently in my head. 
​​I slid the case out of the cabinet drawer onto the floor and opened it. The sight of a brand new .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver took my breath away. 

​​I’d be lying if I said I didn’t love guns.

This is How it Went (Ms.AHL),"So my dad has know about our addiction for awhile. Hes an ex addict and I didn't choose to tell him. He knew far before I ever admitted it when he confronted me. Note that I'm the type of person who once confronted about something serious by someone I love is a) a terrible liar if I try and b) most of the time I can't even bring myself to lie or should I say, keep lying. So my dad has known and is the only person who did. He said a) he knew he couldn't stop us until we we're ready and b) was ""okay"" with it, not really but you know what I mean, so long as we we're happy. 

We've been struggling to detox by ourselves. Everytime we try we end up getting to the point where we're so sick we go back to the d-boy, if we had the money, because usually we help him out and it's free but if we've been sick the last 2 days we can't exactly run a few errands first. Or if we were too broke, before we had our nifty little arrangement, we figured out the cash side of things. Note we've gone 15 hours into day 2 before, so 39 hours total. 

We decided we needed help and I knew my dad was willing to help both of us. But, there's a complication, my dad along with being an ex-addict is a felon and he's in a work release prison program. While he doesn't live ""on-site"" anymore because he's progressed enough to have his own place, he does still have restrictions. 2 days ago today I called my dad and asked for his help detoxing. He said he'd do anything he could and started the approval process to do it at either his house or my grandpa's. Obviously some of his ""team"" had their concerned. 

Right off the bat they said my fiance ""AHL"" couldn't do it with us. He'd have to make his own plan. A plan my dad was still 100% willing to help with. Up until today though I knew they were worried about the ""safety"" of doing it in a non-medical environment, ER, hospital, mental hospital (just detox, or inpatient) I didn't think there were going to be any problems once we got the logistics figured out. 

Boy was I fucking wrong. Don't get me wrong, some of his team are on board but there is one person specifically who isn't. One of his therapists, let's call her A. I called A last night after meeting with my dad to talk about how it was going on his side and what he needed from me. He said A was concerned because she's had too many patients die before, in even medical detox. That even an MD she knew who specialized in detox wouldn't let his son do it at home, because of the risks and because if something did happen they'd have everything they needed right there (no shit, it's a hospital). It should be noted that I hate hospitals. I just went to the ER Sunday night after 3 weeks of having an asthma attack. I have a fairly mild form of asthma so yes, it is possible. However they told me if I had let it continue for another couple days to a week I could've died. 

I told A all of this and basically her response was she won't approve it at my dad's house or my grandpa's, her exact words, ""there's no way I'm letting that happen"". That the only way to do it is at a hospital. I told her I won't go. She said if I'm so eager to do it by myself that I can do it by myself and then go to the ER when I can't deal with it anymore. I told her I've tried doing it by myself and I know on my own, in that much pain I'd go back to my dealer before I ever went to the ER. I guess she doesn't believe me because her tune didn't change. I thanked her for her advice and here we are. 

TL;DR ready to get clean, dad is willing to help, he's a felon and has a team who needs to approve it at his house or with his involvememt at my grandpa's, one of his team (one of his therapists) told me she would never let either happen and that the only way to do it is in a hospital of some kind.

There are so many songs by Lou Reed to choose from but I'll go for a slightly less obvious one -

If it weren't for the fact that my girlfriend says that's not normal I would see no problem with it, as I feel entitled to rich tourists' cash.

My life is a long waiting period between baggies, and my only social contacts are with middle aged junkies who smoke up at my dealer's (I'm in my early twenties), as well as my girlfriend and three friends I see less and less, as I believe they are alienated by my recent behaviour.

The worst thing is that I am doing exactly the same things that were done to me when I began taking drugs. Intimidating people and manipulating them into buying a gram of chalk they know is not coke, taking them to an ATM at knifepoint; exactly the same things which were inflicted upon me and which made me believe people were pieces of shit. And now here I am, and I enjoy it because I like feeling power over some poor hipster teens or tourists.

I feel like I'm slowly becoming a piece of shit, a waste of space, and I don't seem to care. Why do I keep getting away with this? Deep down I know that as long as people keep believing my bullshit, I will go on with this shitty behaviour, and it's not going to end well. Only my girlfriend knows about this, though, and even then she doesn't know the full extent. My parents think I'm keeping it together and just smoke weed and such. They made me promise not to screw up, but it's starting to seem inevitable.

I've told myself I'll go back to NA, but I still have three baggies left, so it will have to wait...

Thanks for hearing me out, I needed to tell someone and I know you guys understand this shit. Hopefully one day I'll stop being a lazy, nasty fuck. The thing is I've alway's been very polite and helpful, and still am (when in ""normal"" mode); yet now it seems so easy to betray people who thought you're cool when they met you, and joking along with them knowing full well you'll pull a knife on them in a few minutes if they don't give in to verbal intimidation/insistence. I promised my gf I'll stop that shit at least, but man the idea of getting such easy money...

By the way I know I'm a massive cunt, at least I won't lie to myself on that aspect any longer.

EDIT. Thank you for confirming my suspicions. I am indeed an arsehole. I think I needed a reality check cause most of the junkies I hang out with either approve of these methods or they don't give a shit. This is not normal behaviour and I shall try to correct it. And thanks for telling me what a cunt I am (I mean it, I really needed that, people treat me like the victim, but I'm anything but. I feel pity for everyone who has to deal with my antics).",1535481532.0

So I went into rehab, one that I’ve been to a few times that I absolutely love. Was there 3 times before I went in this most previous time, but always left early— 14 days was the most I’ve done, but it’s a 28 day program. So this time I actually graduated, June 22nd-July 20th, and then I left, went home, and that night smoked bud, next day went to a meeting at that rehab I was at, then bought a bag— basically in the 4 days I was home I hit the ground running, not to mention I overdosed on the day I went back, July 24th. 

This time was cool too, so I stayed until August 11th and then went to a sober living part of the building, and it was fucking AMAZING. The set up there was a 3 day restriction, you could go outside and such but you can’t leave the premises of the building until your restriction was over, so that was awesome. Then on my 4th day being down there, I relapsed on dope... of fucking course..

So the day after I relapsed, long story short, one of my favorite counselors I was talking to from upstairs where I was at, who is in recovery (14 years), saw my pinned ass pupils and had them drop me, so their thing was either go back upstairs to Aspire, (The unit I was on before), or go back home. So I went back upstairs for 2 days, then I left because I felt as though I had learned about everything that I could, it just was the type of thing where I had to use the knowledge I had accumulated. 

So I’ve been out about 10 days and just am fuckin up. I used for about a week up until Saturday and then went through baby withdrawals. Then yesterday I decided to be a dumb fuck and pick up a bag, and I’m sure it will completely reset my withdrawals and they will start again tonight or tomorrow, which I am afraid of because tomorrow I am going on vacation to TN.

I guess I’m just giving y’all an update, but I just feel like such a dumb fuck for fucking up the great opportunity of that fucking recovery home. It was fucking amazing there and I guess I’m still using because I feel guilty for fuckin it up, you know? I don’t know... How have you guys been though? Anything new? ",1535480744.0

They have spread propaganda convincing generations that the uninsured poor are the reason healthcare premiums are so high.

When that gets proved wrong and They are pressed for the truth, they use their back up scapegoat topic research and development.  Do you trust corporations to create the drugs for humanity's future? How many drugs, vaccines, viral understanding, life saving procedures, and antibiotics have been buried and shelved because they develop drugs based on market need and profit margins? How much longer will you allow politicians to keep shooting down legislation and allow them to keep these monopolies on our health?

It took me 2 emails to get a number to set up a sales meeting to buy the active ingredient in a drug that costs 25k a month with insurance. 5 kilos would cost a .months pay for a full time 10 dollar an hour wage worker.  According to the estimated statistics, I could provide every diagnosed patient with daily medication for their life time.

United States laws make only one company a legal a seller. This medication keeps people alive. It's a necessity. Not a relief-comfort drug.

How long can patients afford 20k a month? They die without this medication.

How can a corporation price gouge these people? The CEO is on record smiling quoting ""supply and demand allows us to charge whatever we want. If they want to live, they have to pay""


This is sickening and lobbyists ensure this remains the status quo. Lining politicians pockets is how this whole system was created. Its why the govt spreads propaganda to keep the public arguing with each other instead of demanding change.

Our whole drug approval system needs over hauled. Even Cuba has a lung cancer vaccine first developed beginning in 1993.  Investment managers for,corporations are not interested in developing cures or vaccines. They cannot be trusted to make these decisions.

Their developments are decided by profit and there is hardly any profit in cures. Only drugs that manage symptoms so keep buying them for life.


Health care costs so much because of corporate greed. Nearly every other 1st world democracy can produce medication that costs chump,change or provided free. They also can afford R&D.


DO NOT BELIEVE THE CORPORATE PROPAGANDA. TAKE YOUR UNIVERSAL RIGHT FOR HEALTHCARE TO YOUR POLITICIANS FACE.

I'm utterly disgusted every time I hear another story about families going bankrupt and having to watch their loved one die.  Leaving their family a lifetime in debt as if the death wasn't enough.

And the only other time I almost threw up was when I took my first blue oxy.

Getting to the point I know for some people taking any opiates makes them extremely nauseous and can cause them to throw up even. I’ve never had that problem, until recently. For the last month of so every time I have taken any opiate, be it a hydro or oxy, I’ve always felt sick to the stomach, so sick that I’ve even yacked a few time because of it, and it all started recently

I don’t take opiates that often, maybe 2-3 times a month, 20-30 mg of either hydros or oxy. I thought maybe it was the lack of food because I don’t really eat before taking pills but I have always done that. I then decided to take 30mg of hydros last week and eat before and snacked a little during my high but I still felt nauseous. And I almost threw up the next morning

A story of why relapsing after ten years was the worse decision I’d ever made. It all started with that positive pregnancy test.,"I woke up this morning, slightly panicked. I thought I was back in my country of birth but I turned around and could feel the warmth of my boyfriend’s chest around my back, and his breath slowly tickling the back of my ear. I had put him and our family through so much. He has a child, they were broken up, she carried through and he took full responsibility. I had one too, mine was the product of trauma I thought I had resolved. I had full custody and raised that child alone, pushed through the post natal depression and learned to cherish life. Life at its most innocent and most vulnerable. We were happy alone, the little one and I. We both thrived in ways never thought possible for two and a half a years. I enjoyed my own company and that of what I had created looking at me softly and sweetly every night. I didn’t want anything to change. I had a social life, but didn’t drink. I didn’t want a companion, I had one for life whom I would teach to be independent, compassionate and loving, one that I would shield from the years of trauma I had undergone. 

It all changed that one night halfway across the world. Every time I’m in my partners arm the memories of that night keep flashing back. I wasn’t seeking anyone, and in the blink of an eye two lives became one. I knew who I truly was in that moment and didn’t have to hide it and didn’t feel the need to hide it. That same smell I wake up to every morning as I snuggle up tightly under the douna brings back electrifying feelings of a connection that can’t be explained. I’d never experienced love before. I’d experienced what I thought was love, masked as manipulation, gaslighting and abuse. 

We were at a big event, surrounded by mutual friends we had all known for years but nothing mattered anymore. The warmth of his lips, the way he gently stroked my hair, looked into my eyes, the way we writhed and wriggled all night long, not once letting go of each other. The intensity of those feelings grew between us every day and it continues to grow. 

But we’d been broken and healed in the past. We both had our coping mechanisms, I was more open about my emotions, he contained his. I knew something was off physically, I didn’t feel myself, I felt drained, nauseous, and at the end of a long day, I robotically went to the pharmacy and purchased a few tests. All five of them came up positive. We had a family, but not a biological one. I never wanted children, but I did now. The way he looked after my own child and his, both brought into the world without our consent. It was still a little early but we could make it work. We could make it work he said as he held my face tightly but gently, wiping the single tear slowly making its way down my face. We’d discussed it, but not this soon, just throwaway comments, baby names, the usual, we never expected it to happen this soon. 

Six weeks and three days. Perfectly healthy, I was told to come back in a few weeks. We had done this before but this time it was tears of elation and joy. The sickness started to get worse, much worse than my last one. He stayed up with me clenching my hands as I emptied out the bile and choked and the acidity, knowing this time it would be worth it. 

It was 3 am. I never leave my phone on loud but I had that evening, I quietly left the room and took the phone call. My whole world collapsed around me as my uncle told me my mother had been hiding cancer from me. It was serious. I don’t remember but I just screamed. She was my only parent. She had abused me, physically, emotionally and financially but she was just repeating the cycle. She was my only parent. Or so I thought. 

Baby was doing well. I had to leave the country soon to see my mother, and I had come to terms with it. The prognosis wasn’t as severe as first thought. I used breathing excercises to get myself to sleep as he was away on work. I felt this tingling pain down my side. I ignored it. It got gradually worse but I slept through it. 4 am. I woke up in a pool of blood. Alone. I called him. He told me to hang up and call and ambulance and he’d be on the first flight back. I couldn’t talk to him for 24 hours, just me alone in the worst hospital in the eastern suburbs as it happened to be the closest. I was sedated. I woke up and there he was. Nestled in between my neck, bloodshot eyes. How would we pay this month’s rent? We earned good money, but a huge tax bill had just hit. The rent had gone up. He lost the job and I couldn’t work. I felt like it was all my fault. He was distant. 60% of relationships ends after abortions or miscarriages, I was terrified. Out conversations were monotonous. I had never felt so alone and the hormones were playing tricks with my mind. 

That’s when I made the worst mistake I possibly could. I knew where to score, so I did. I knew it was the worst possible thing I could do. I never had any cravings over those ten years. I turned to the needle pretty fast. Things got nasty. We were arguing. I can’t remember half of it. It was all my fault and i had to change it. I went onto subuxone. My dose was too high and after a few months the side effects were killing me. I tried to taper until that fateful message came though. “She died last night”. My sister, 20 years older than me had succumbed to ovarian cancer I went out for a long walk. It’s a safe area normally but those who hunt vulnerability can sniff it out a mile away. Out of nowhere. Three guys, two holding me down, one trying to grab my stuff, two trying to undress me. Two women across the scream saw and screamed for help, the men ran, my clothes has been torn but my bag was intact. I used all my strength possible, everything I had left in me to retain my dignity. I couldn’t tell how quick time was passing, but the NSW police and paramedics were here. Court is in mid September. Straight back to the H. 

I returned to my country of birth to see my mother shortly after that. She could tell I wasn’t well, but everything I told her, would be my fault, the miscarriage, the attempted mugging and rape, all of it. She would just berate me and make me feel like the useless piece of shit she had done a good job of making me feel all my life. The H was cheaper out there. It didn’t stop. My wife beating, alcoholic piece of shit dad who we thought was missing and presumed dead had died and been cremated a week before my sister. My use got heavier. The rest of my story can be found in my previous posts. 

I’m done. I woke up smiling for the first time this morning. Four days out of hospital. He told me it was going to be ok. It felt like that first night again as our bodies intertwined into one and he kissed me gently on the forehead. We made love like we normally do, selflessly, each taking care of each other. The mild WDs had started to kick in and the oxytocin was flowing through me. We held each other like we normally do and had a playful fight about who loved each other more. 

I think I’m going to start my bupe taper tomorrow. I’ll see. I have a family. I have someone who loves me unconditionally and I’m learning to love myself unconditionally again. Never again. 

If anyone is struggling. Reach out to me. Don’t keep it to yourself. No matter what anyone tells you, you’re a human being who is worthy of love and respect. ",1535444532.0

I should have just flushed it and been done but nope I just did a fat line and got fucked up. Well 5 hours goes by and I’m starting to get sick so I say time for my subs. 25 mins laters I started sweating really bad and got cold. Than it was like I was exploding out of skin in every direction from muscle spasms. So my dumbass thought I need more subs so I put another in my mouth and literally a couple seconds later I rushed to my bathroom saying I’m gunna throw up. I put my mouth under the sink and wash the sub out and also puke. Than I ran to the John to shit my brains out! I have to saw half a month of being blocked up becoming liquid that fast shocked me. Than I had to puke again so I was in complete hell. That’s when I realized that this was precipated withdrawals. I would literally make fun of this shit and say it wasn’t real. So I go into my mind and say this isn’t real, this isn’t real and than I faced reality and panicked...it’s real. I do the only thing I could do and jump into a shower. It helped somewhat with the hot and cold on demand but the illusion started to fade. I get into my robe and call my junkie master. He says there is basically nothing you can do. I’m like omg I don’t if I can handle this. The worst tremors of my life and I was thinking of killing my self. My mom finds me later and takes me to the hospital. High dose promethzine and colodine actually helped me a lot. Don’t think this is a joke or it can’t happen.  I will say that whenever I was sick after that shit it was nothing! I had such a high benchmark to compare the pain it makes regular with deals a cake walk. I remember when I was sick with my friend. He was freaking out and shit, I was fine cuz I was like a god now.

8:00 PM : hit some lines (if i have any coke)

8:10 : 75mg promethazine, coke has hit

8:25 : coke starts to comedown

8:30 : Opiates start to hit, bliss from here.

Is there some type of hack for partially bypassing the hangover symptoms? Like when you’re wasted, you pound a bunch of water and take some Ibuprofen before bed to avoid that crushing headache?

Looking nonchalantly at the guards, they don't even know we are on the planet. He puts the purse in his waistband then sliiiiides the carrier bag back!!! ""Let's go!'' We get up to go.... and leave. We exit through the main entrance and take a right turn. ''Harry, stay in front of me because there are camera's and if they are on us, you are blocking the view''. I do exactly that. 4 seconds later he shouts ''Harry! We got it! We fuckin got it!!'' Remember, we were both sick as fuck when this whole deal went down? This was no plan either? I went to see him for some sugar or coffee? Anyway, this was where we end up. Get to an ATM. He works his magic n I get half the charm. £200. $360? This was the first time!

I've always tried it on a mostly empty stomach, occasionally with agmatine which is known to be a potentiator of opiates.

I've never felt any euphoria or bodily sensations. At best, it feels like a cup of chamomile tea to me. I felt very subtle effects once as mentioned. My mood was slightly lifted for maybe 10 minutes and I got a very slight body buzz, but nothing stronger than what smoking weed would do to me.


 Is it possible to just be a non-responder to opiates?

Emotions are non-existent when I use, the only emotion I have is joy when I'm going to pick up, but I can't even enjoy doing the dope because I'm already stressing how I'll get more. After some time of using  It gets to a point where the only thoughts I have are how/when/where/money. I've conquered it before but it's always there in the back of my head and what I've come to realize now is it will never go away. Every time I've relapsed it was great for those first few weeks, the first couple hits were like the first time. A few weeks later Instead of getting a bag every check, it's now when I go to work, lunch, the gym, slowly progressing in to not even going outside unless it directly involves how/when/where/money. This has become my life at the moment, chasing a high that I no longer enjoy because I'm sick from not having it. Every dollar I've ever made when using has went straight to dope, I can't devote any more of my life to this. Every person in my life gas been affected by my use directly or indirectly.

(Take in mind when I snort tar I make cheese so it's not just straight tar going into my nose)

Also I just recently got some gun powder heroin and that's seemingly giving me some nausea as well. Is it perhaps related to the drip and me swallowing alot of much more potent heroin and it upsetting my stomach?

I am running an experiment as of now, I put alot of moisture on the gun powder and turned it back to tar and am making cheese with it to see if perhaps this helps with my nausea. I'll let y'all know how that works.

Does anyone have any explanation, or perhaps any tips to combat this nausea it's extremely uncomfortable and I NEVER get nauseous except from these different types of heroin. What can I do?

Thanks😊

Edit: update to my experiment making the gun powder into cheese, it worked. No nausea at all. This leads me to believe I was getting nausea from the drip because when I make cheese it gives me no drip. This is great news. FOR SCIENCE",1535406489.0

Accidentally dropped my baggie of K57’s and then ran it over :( - so I need help with how to go about using them while still maintaining a specific dosage.  For the last 5 years or so I’ve made sure to set daily limits for my pill usage to make sure my tolerance doesn’t sky rocket.  So I like to know exactly how much I’m taking.

My issue is that with a bag of crushed pills I have no idea how much I’ll be taking each time and won’t be able to keep track of my usage.

I was thinking if I mixed the pills with water I could then measure out a specific amount of liquid since I know how many milligrams will be in the solution - do K57s gum up when you mix them with water?  Or is there a better method that I have not thought of?  Also as a side note this may be a good time for me to try plugging them, would this have a BA equal or greater than oral?",1535405570.0

Got some FIRE that's worth telling a story about... Here goes,"So I got a super steady connect. Basically always out on the same block/corner. I call and ask if they're out there and they usually always say yes and to come thru. They're open from 7AM-9PM EVERY DAY (including weekends and holidays) like clockwork. They sell bags of boy (dope; my DOC) and raw if someone wants to buy raw. Also sell hard, soft, bars, bud, etc. Basically a one stop shop crew. Not always on the corner but that's why they got numbers. They usually out there tho in the summer, winter not so much. 

&#x200B;

They trust me enough that I got both the ""bosses"" (it's two brothers) of the crew's personal numbers as well as the standard number (some burner phone) they give their customers. Basically I get their bags because it's cheaper for me than raw and I don't buy anything else they sell since all my bread goes to dope. 

&#x200B;

So about their bags. They sell some of the BEST bags anyone would even find here on the west side and are always on point with quality. Shit they even never put fent in their bags (I've had lab tests done on my urine MANY times in my treatment center and I only ever had fent show up once and that was from another connect with shitty bags when I was desperate. Basically I'm saying their quality is on point.

&#x200B;

So today I went to grab and as usual I call and as for 8 bags and they say they'd give me ten. ""Shit, cool thanks"" I said, must be some new shit I thought. When I went there both the brothers were out which made me assume that it was new shit even more. After I grabbed I even noticed the bags were a different color than usual as well.

&#x200B;

Anyways when I got home I did a couple bags and HOLY SHIT. These bags were fire with LONG ass legs. So long that when I decided to do a third bag a few hours in they got me nodding out so hard I haven't experienced that in a LONG time. Basically had the BEST rush ever. When I woke up a bit from my nod I noticed my legs were completely asleep and when I tried to get up I basically fell on my face haha. Was so crazy.

So I'm still high as fuck typing this now and feel great. Haven't gotten a feeling like this in a LONG time so I thought I'd share.

The nurse and doctor I saw should have transferred my prescription to my pharmacy but didn't so I was screwed and couldn't dose Saturday or Sunday. 

Really not impressed at all with this clinic I've been on the phone with my pharmacy and methadone clinic on and off most of today too and they still haven't resolved my script. The first two days without actually weren't that bad but today is absolutely abhorrent. Abysmal stomach feeling can't puke but feel like I need to the only way I could describe this is feeling like acid is sloshing around in my stomach. 

Probably doesn't help that methadone makes me nauseous naturally anyways. Just wish I could actually eat feels like there's a vault of empty space In my stomach lol. And it's windy and kind of ugly outside so evidently I'm absolutely freezing and also having cold sweats thank God the shits haven't started yet. 

I really despise methadone all it does is make me sick to my stomach when I'm on it so I can only eat a meal a day and generally puke bile once or twice everyday ( thankfully I don't have sexual side effects from it like alot of people). And as for subs I can't tolerate them I get a really bad drug rash from the naxalone. 

Anyone else have problems with opiate agonists/ maintenance opiate related drugs? Thankfully recently I did find a program in my city that offers slow release morphine orally the same way that methadone is offered and you can keep increasing to I think about 500mg to a gram depending on your habit. That and when I get takehomes in this program then I wouldn't always have to take orally and could boof/plug. I'm In Canada but where I am does not offer HAT ( heroin addiction treatment). They may be offering hydromorphone assisted maintenance in the future but currently isn't offered either in Alberta. Wondering if anyone thinks it would be a good idea to switch from methadone to morphine substituted treatment.   

Update: Fucking finally I'm not sick anymore I got a dose. Still frustrating as hell though. And my dose was 85mg and because of the clinics fuck up making me miss two days of dosing I only got 65mg today...lame. Positive is at least because I haven't dosed in 2 days I have a bit of a buzz off this 65mg.",1535402545.0

I received an unneeded rx for hydrocodone/acetaminophen syrup after dental surgery and last night decided to try to get high.​

I'm aware of acetaminophen toxicity - I calculated that the entire bottle of syrup was not anywhere near a toxic dose. I drank a little over half the bottle of syrup, which I estimate was about 37mg of hydrocodone.

I chilled out and shitposted on Reddit for an hour or so, then got in bed. Didn't feel ""high"" so much as just relaxed. I could feel that my heart and breathing rate were significantly lower than usual.​

I got up at my normal time and felt super SUPER tired and incredibly nauseous. It's now about 14 hours after I took the syrup, the nausea has diminished a bit, but I could still lay down and take a nap right here on the floor. Everything I've read suggested that the drug should be out of my body by now, but I feel very unlike my usual state.

Is this normal? Is 37mg a high dose for a 125 lb woman? And is there anything I can do to make myself feel better for the rest of the day?

Also, please don’t tell me about the dangers of mixing, I know what they are and I took them anyway. I have four doses of Narcan in the house. It’s not full proof by any means but at least it’s a line of defense beyond my stupidity.

Ive had chronic pain for quite a few years now. Also my immune system sucks and the only indicator of that is elevated levels for lupus like 9 years ago but not enough to call it the disease. I decided it was time to get off suboxone a few months ago. I wanted to see what my baseline was and I hated the effects it had on me. So I did it, it was hard but survived. Meanwhile I had a staph infection which wasnt taken care of after going to the dr like 5 times. They just kept putting me on antibiotics. Worst case scenario happened, got c-diff. Was hospitalized for a week and they finally opened up the staph. Two months later, still recovering from c-diff and staph is worse so now I have a nurse coming every other day to repack my wound. Through all this I havent asked for pain medicine at all. In fact the surgeon argued with me in the hospital about needing something for pain so I took a few norco and that was it. Now Im having a lot of pain in my arm after dressing changes for 12 hours after. They will do nothing about this. My aunt is a nurse and was shocked they didnt prescribe pain relief for dressing changes at least. I had to go to er this weekend they did blood cultures and gave me another antibiotic which Im worried will give me cdiff again and 6 Tylenol with codeine. She did give me iv morphine and is the only one that seemed to care about the pain. This wasnt hurting for the last two months and now its unbearable. I was supposed to see the same surgeon today, they called me and said dont come in we cant give you medicine take Tylenol. This is the same doctor that wanted me to take medicine in the hospital. I was like what? Ok well thats not my only concern. They still wouldnt see me. He just stares at me when I talk to him and ask for advice about staph infection and which dr to see for other symptoms. Like seriously what the hell. First of all you have to see like 3/4 different doctors for the same issue. US healthcare sucks. And then as soon as you say you have pain people are suspicious instead of actually helping. Im like no wonder so many people just try to find a connect. Its insane. Ive refused pain meds many times, i dont want to take opiates on a schedule anymore. Anyone else have these issues? I know Ive read some stories on here about pain management horrors. Is this because of new regulations? My visiting nurse looked at me like I was drug seeking as Im yelling while they pack the wound. Like your an idiot woman. Im just done with it all and venting.

The erotic intelligence of plants, the erotic intelligence of magic mushrooms, of magic cacti, of cannabis, of ayahuasca...the erotic intelligence of poppies.  
Lie back and think of Cambodia, and let Poppy pleasure you. No need to disrobe, to get erect, or to move at all. Actually, I must reach for my pen and papers; I feel a poem coming.  
An opium poem is the orgasm cry of a man in the motionless throes of sex with Poppy. More quiet and still than the most vigorous thrustings with a woman of his own kind, but far, far more pleasurable. You would not think so just by looking at him, calm as a horizon; nor would he know who was judging him and his choice of intoxication, for his eyes are closed. Nor would he care, for his brain is open to all such pleasures, as open as a woman's legs for the invitation of her own favourite passion and the man of choice who would fulfill this for her, seemingly endlessly.

Waiting for the methadone WDs to kick in before I start my bupe taper.,"As the lucidity set in, I realised what I had done. I realised that this wasn’t ten years ago and I wasn’t that teen who could conquer all her demons and burn all her bridges without consequence. The trauma I had tried to suppress was bubbling to the surface so quickly yet quietly. It was Friday evening. My boyfriend came home, and I was making a cup of tea. Suddenly I couldn’t see. I couldn’t speak. There were ants in front of me everywhere. The room was full of ants. I was told to go lie down but I couldn’t walk. I was carried somewhere. I went to lie down but it wasn’t my room. This wasn’t my house. All these people were around me. Was this it? The afterlife. It was pretty boring. It was bright. 

I woke up. 

“You have severe PTSD” 

I couldn’t open my mouth. 

“Your NSW health records told us you relapsed a few months ago. You are on a methadone taper. Do you know what year it is? Do you know where you are?” 

Nothing. 

Just my boyfriend crying so much that I could feel his emotional pain throughout my body. 

“Do you know what your name is?” 

Nothing. 

“Her Mum’s got cancer. We had a miscarriage. Her sister died. She found out her dad who was a wife beating alcoholic died and was cremated a week before her sister died. She got mugged and borderline raped before the police arrived” he blubbered. 

They gave me an injection, I passed out and he snuggled up into my arms. 

I woke up. It was 6 am. We walked the five minutes home as he held me and we fell asleep. 

I never sought him out. I was living a sober life and had achieved amazing things in those ten years. He had also undergone trauma in his life, we had both been in unbelievably fucked up abusive relationships and both had children from those relationships. We weren’t codependent, we wouldn’t use anything together except the odd bit of coke once every four months. I didn’t even drink. I love his child like my own and he loves mine like his own but they’re being taken care of and in good hands while I heal. We take care of each other. He taught me what life and a healthy relationship was. He taught me what a normal family dynamic was. 

I was happy before I met him and he was happy before I met him. I didn’t rely on him for my happiness. He just added to it. His beautiful dimples. The way he took care of me and the way he took care of my son. The way I felt true love the first time I set eyes on him. I have a family now. That’s it. No more abuse. Just unconditional love. They don’t deserve this. They deserve me at my best. 

Edit: to those of you struggling, there are people who care about you believe it or not. The first person you should learn to love is yourself. You deserve yourself at your best.

*The introduction*

The year was 2012, I was in high school, I found some pills in the back of a drawer. I knew enough about pain pills from hearing my older neighborhood friends talk about them. I knew they had *something* in them that would get me high. My dad had mouth/jaw surgery, but it was over a year before. These had sat unused, as he hated the nausea they caused. I looked some info up on the internet, and everything said it was pretty much safe to take. I dug more around the house and found two more bottles, these ones full and semi hidden. 70 total 10mg hydrocodone/ 325mg acetaminophen. And then about 20 total 7.5mg norcos. The bottles were semi dusty, I knew they had been forgotten about. I popped one 10mg and within a couple hours I knew I would really like them.
I hoarded them all.

*The young entrepreneur*

I waited weeks before I even touched another one. I didn’t want to be high around my parents and them notice the pills were gone. They’d put two and two together. I told a few of my class mates I had found some pills, interest grew and some people asked what they were like. Some wanted to buy a few. I had some friends, some of the older kids from school who sold drugs, so I asked what I should charge if I had a script. They basically said $6-$10 for the 10s and $4-$7 for the 7.5s, depending on how much I liked the person. As I had not paid anything, my profit would come no matter what. So I sold for as much as possible in every situation. Made a pretty penny. Did a couple. That’s when I fell in love the first time; my god look at this money. My fourteen year old self was astounded.

*Now your scripts you found are out, now what?*

Those older kids I was friends with, one had an ability to grab Percocet scripts. I had my money I made, and bought three Percocet scripts. A total of 90 10mg oxycodone/ 325 acetaminophen. I would owe him some money when I made it, but again I sold them so quick I only had the chance to do a few. I did this a couple times. One of my favorite hobbies.

*You sit on top of your throne of sins*

Eventually I went over my connects heads and met their plugs. My friends were generous enough to put me on. They saw my potential. I was good enough for a couple months. Saved money. Didn’t do my own drugs too much. But eventually, ran into relationship problems, and I grew nasty drug habits as a result. Switched the Percocet for Oxy 20s. I had it on tap, and I didn’t worry about making money, I knew it would come. I had made enough addicts, now one more in myself. I grew less reliable, they put up with it, or else they started to get sick. 
I started to get sick. I had to slow down, most of them sped up.

*Only thing that makes the voices stop*

My head, has always been plagued by insecurities, anxiety, mood swings, unwarranted aggression, violent depression, sadism and narcissism; a sick mind medicated and sedated by a warm comforting chemical. Docile and seemingly stable, my family thought I was doing better in life. My peers, thought I was like two people. There was the one who was using, and had his dose that day. He was funny, charismatic. The one you wanted to spend time with. The one who was calm and confident.

Then there was the sober one, the one who collected debts. The one who made their hair stand up. The one they hated picking up from. Scary and sober, unstable, bat shit insane. 

*Head in the clouds, fuzzy thoughts, puddles in my brain. My sanity loves to jump in puddles*

The year is 2015, three years of heavy poly drug use, began to take its toll on my mind. I began to think how Yoda talks. I wanted to quit using all drugs. The event that made me decide was a shamanic type trip, induced by making tea with 2 grams of shrooms, cooling it. I dropped in 100 mg of MDMA crystals into the tea, and I put 50ug of LSD onto my tongue. During the trip I felt my body so polluted that I was very sick and threw up after giving thought to how I felt and what caused that. My own choices to over do recreational drugs. I weened off opioids over the course of a month. Cocaine I was able to stop without problem. Quitting amps made me narcoleptic for awhile. Dissociative’s really were the crux of the problem I’d say as far as mental scattering. Benzos and opioids made me increasingly nauseous and hung over the next day. I took it as my body supporting my decisions. 

*The journey so far afterward*

Every once in awhile, if I get the ability, I will indulge and buy a few Oxy 20s. I will also wet my beak with other substances, but this is the opiates sub. It’s been three years and I want to live life like I used to. I can’t, if I was half as high as I am now at work, I couldn’t focus on anything. But damn I miss this warm feeling of euphoria. My life now seems so boring to what I used to do, the people I hung out with. Over the past few months I’ve found myself slipping back into that lifestyle. Riding around the strip, visiting the different plugs and partying hard. When I used to be involved with this scene, fake pills weren’t the norm. Pressies weren’t everywhere. The candies were real, and always hit, always safe. It’s so dangerous now it seems, and more expensive and harder to find legit stuff. 

Please be safe when you go out and play, I’d like for you to be able to come out and play tomorrow. Look both ways before you cross the street, test your drugs. Don’t sell fake shit.",1535361294.0

I think my brain is fucked up pls help,"Hey everyone I have a few questions about some shit that I need help with. Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

I've been addicted to opiates for about three or four years now. I was on subs for about a year and then I had a big relapse last year. My habit wasn't as big as some, but I was doing 5-6 oxy 30s a day. I've switched from oxy to subs way too many times within the past year and I just had 3 months clean from everything but subs. With that being said, this weekend I decided to have a little fun.


Within the last month or so I've been experiencing some issues where the subs have been giving me anxiety. I've been snorting them because I have an intranasal fetish (I realize that I need to stop doing it because it's just a waste), and I don't think I'm even taking 1mg a day (I've been trying to ween myself down). The lines I'm doing are extremely small, but sometimes I do get ""high"" from it. I dose the same size line about 3 times a day, which is MAYBE .25mg per dose. It may be a tad more/less. If I don't take enough, or if I wait too long to take the dose then I start feeling kinda weird and shitty. I know most of you have experienced the pre-withdrawal fogginess, and the restless feeling in the pit of your stomach. I thought subs had a pretty long half life so should I even be going into withdrawal so soon? There have been times where I've woken up in the middle of the night with restless legs.

Anyway, I did two of those lines on Friday: the first was around 9am and then again at like...11:30-11:45am. I had to dose a second time because the first line didn't really do anything. Later that evening I bought three oxy 30s around 7:30pm, dosed 7.5mg (just to be safe, lots of fakes going around) and I felt it. It wasn't strong or anything, but I was feeling kinda nice, and then I took another 7.5mg a little while later. I've dosed like this pretty much all weekend and I've felt it every single time, and now I only have one left which I'm saving for tomorrow.

I'm not gonna lie and say that this weekend hasn't been nice, because it has. Subs have been doing some weird shit to me lately (lots of anxiety and lots of brain fog/depersonalization) so getting some relief and getting high has been wonderful. I promised my fiancee that this is a one-off and that I'm getting back on subs once the last one is gone. 

As for questions, has anyone else experienced this with subs? Why is my tolerance so fucking low? Is it because I've been snorting them? Is my induction period gonna be bad or will the withdrawal be pretty mild since I wasn't using too much? Should I not take the subs and see how it goes for a couple of days?

I know this post is kinda all over the place, but I just want some advice. Tell me whatever you wanna tell me or whatever you think. Everything sucks right now and I don't wanna do this shit anymore. ",1535336355.0

I'm currently on Suboxone after having been addicted to Fentanyl for just over a year. I'm happy to say I'm 6 months and 1 week clean. I started at a very high dose of Suboxone and have now managed to taper down to 0.2-0.4mg per day. However I have a surgery coming up in a couple of weeks where they will be putting me under with anaesthetic. Would the Suboxone in my system affect the anaesthetic? I really don't want to wake up halfway thru surgery or something like that but I'm also cautious about mentioning my Suboxone use to the anaesthetist as it's not prescribed to me and also he may put me on some sort of nation-wide drug addict registrar which would be far from ideal considering how far I've come since my Fentanyl using days.

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/92k18g/why_opanas_is_dangerous/
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 There was a lot of back and forth on people saying my math was wrong, users who stated that there was no way oral Opanas were stronger than Percocets oral, personal experience not adding up to my conclusions, etc. I am back now, after doing some more research, to give a more in depth walk through of what the actual truth on the potency is. To start, I will give a recap on what information I was referring to, and the point I was trying to get across:

First, the base comparison we start with is the ratio of potency when comparing Oxycodone to Oxymorphone, which many people throw around is a 2:1 ratio. 2mg of Oxycodone equals 1mg of Opana. This fact is true. HOWEVER, people forget to add the next bit of CRUCIAL information with that ratio, which is that this 2:1 value is when comparing ORAL administration. This value is only true when you are trying to calculate oral doses. Next we will look into the bio-availability of different ROA(routes of administration):

Oral Absorption: Pharmaceutical Ratio: [2mg Oxycodone = 1mg Oxymorphone]
Oxycodone= ~87% efficiency
Oxymorphone= ~12% efficiency
This means that Opanas are DOUBLE the strength of Percocets, with only 1/10th of the total administered dose even being metabolized. Oxycodone, with almost 90% of the total dose being absorbed, is still only HALF of the potency of Oxymorphone.
---------------------------------------

Intranasal Absorption(snorting):
Oxycodone= ~47% efficiency
Oxymorphone= ~42% efficiency
(This is where I start to lay out my point. Also, keep in mind I am getting these values from simply looking up the bioavaliability of these opiates with different ROA's online on health websites and medical journals. Anyone can find any of the values I start with by taking a couple minutes to Google search.)
---------------------------------------
As shown, Oxymorphone has now jumped in it's total absorption from ~12% orally, to 42% when snorted. This is a 350% increase in potency. Let us use an example just to see how crazy this value is. I will start with us scoring a 10mg K71 Pill(Instant-Release Oxymorphone). This is one of the very few Oxymorphone pills that can be crushed effectively. To compare:
-If swallowed, only 1.2mg of 10mg will be active in the body. However, that 10mg Opana will be as strong as swallowing 20mg of Percocet. At 87% oral absorption, 17.4mg of Oxycodone will be active in the body. Using the 2:1 strength ratio, 10mg Opana = 20mg Percocet. after calculating the absorbed weight, we see that 1.2mg of metabolized Opana EQUALS 17.4mg of metabolized Percocet. That is a 14:1 active chemical ratio(14mg absorbed Percocet=1mg absorbed Opana).

Now we can move onto snorting. Let us take that same 10mg Opana IR pill again. Instead of swallowing the pill with only a 12% efficiency rate, we will snort it to get 42% efficiency. Snorting the Opana gives us 4.2mg that is metabolized. Let me explain that to you again; 42% absorption VS 12% absorption! 4.2mg / 1.2mg = 3.5X increase in potency from the SAME DOSE just by snorting the bastard. So what does this mean? Well, Snorting all of that 10mg IR Opana would be the same as ORALLY TAKING 35mg of Opana. Now, remember that 2:1 ratio? That is the absolute ratio for oral Oxycodone vs oral Oxymorphone. I will input that into the string of steps in our calculation. Now:

10mg Opana(Intranasal) X 3.5(value snorted vs oral) = 35mg Opana(Oral)

35mg Opana(Oral) X 2(oral value Opana vs Percocet) = 70mg Oxycodone(Oral)

Now, let us compare snorting Oxycodone instead of orally taking it. The Absorption rate of Oxycodone goes down from 87% absorption orally, to 47% intranasally. This is a 46% reduction in potency(That sucks. Kids, always eat your Percocets!) We now continue our math:

70mg Oxycodone(Oral) X 0.46(Reduced efficiency value) = 32.2mg(amount that is lost from non-absorption) - 70mg(Oral Oxycodone initial weight) = -37.8mg Oxycodone(Insufflated)

Ignore the negative sign; 70mg of Oral Oxycodone becomes only a 37.8mg dose when snorted. Divide both values, and we find that:

 1.85mg Snorted Oxycodone = 1mg Oral Oxycodone, OR 1.85mg(Snorted):1mg(Oral)

Finally, in order to get the same potency of 70mg of oral Oxycodone, one must snort about 130mg of Percocet up the nose!

10mg Opana(Snorted) will now be equivelent to: =====

35mg Opana(Oral)
70mg Percocet(Oral)
and 130mg Percocet(Snorted)

There you go. I hope this has became clear to understand how powerful Oxymorphone becomes when one decides to snort the contents. It is easy to see how people are overdosing on Opanas with little tolerance.

As always, feedback is much appreciated! Stay safe out there :)

9aispy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9aispy/variety/,2,https://redd.it/9aispy,lazerberriez,Variety,"I love doing as many different drugs as possible. I'm at about 90 right now. I love to compare all there nuanced differences. One class I hardly explored was opioids, only having done hydros, oxys, trams, and more recently codeine a limited amount of times. Recently I decided to say fuck it and just order all the ones that caught my interest. I got tapentadol, opium, hydromorphone, methadone, heroin, and oxymorphone, doing most only once (except tapentadol, that shit is so cheap its impossible to not get a g worth of pills). It was a fun and very risky experiment I did on myself since I am most addictively inclined toward opioids over anything else (addicted to kratom, I know, pussy shit; also stims don't have much of a hold on me, I have fun and then reach a point where I'm done and give away whatever I have left). Anyways I have found the differences between opioids to not be that interesting. I mainly just noticed differences with duration, euphoria, and level of sedation. Anyways Imma rank em anyways, keep in mind that I don't IV and don't wanna cross that line.  

hydrocodone- seems to be the basic bitch of opioids. Nothing really amazing when it comes to euphoria and just doesn't hit the spot that well. I give it a 7/10 because any opioid is good to some extent  

tramadol - was fun, I enjoyed the duration and energy of it but did not like the nausea. 7.1/10  

hydromorphone - I boofed it, it was nice but went away fast. I also didn't really know my tolerance so I played it safe and didn't get that rush people love it for. It was very short though and I didn't think it was worth the cost (pills ain't cheap man) 7.5/10

tapentadol - alright euphoria and decent duration and not too sedating. I found it quite nice. I also like the kinda dissociating feelings it can bring with light visuals, definetely a more unique feeling opioid. 7.5/10  

Fentanyl - forgot to mention this one earlier, I got it before surgery at the hospital and since I was able to get pretty high I'm counting it. It made me feel quite warm and nice, I was buzzing from it for a good couple hours. I still didn't have that awesomeness of some other opioids I've done. 7.8/10  

Codeine - I really like codeine, probably cause I'm a noob but it gave me a level of relaxation that I've not experienced on other opioids. It was very laid back and just nice, although its a bit lacking after the come up. It's also the only opioid that made me itch a slow moving red rash that started at the top of my head and slowly moved down my body til I took a benadryl. I looked like I was tweaking with how much I was scratching myself.

Opium - I liked this one quite a bit. There's nothing like smoking some opium off foil with the gang. I enjoyed it smoking, it gave me a weird very dreamlike state and I felt very relaxed and comfy. It wasn't too sedating either. I liked it even better when eating it, although smoking a couple cigs on it with some kratom made me throw it. Gave me the warm and fuzzies before that though. Solid 8/10.  

Methadone - I really liked methadone. It was nothing crazy with euphoria but was still one of the better ones I felt. It was a little sedating. What I really liked was the long duration. I was high all fucking day and when I throw kratom on top my face started flushing (I fucking love the flushing) like when I first started drinking that green shit. 8.5/10  

Oxycodone - Now oxycodone really hits the spot. It just hits you right in the right spot of your receptors if ya feel me. I only did it a couple time but I found it to be very enjoyable. That's all I have to say, sorry I'm not very good at this and am just stimmed out and thought rating all the opioids I did would be fun cause fuck it why not amirite y'all. 9/10 cause you deserve it oxy  

Heroin - I smoked it. Made me feel really gooey, one of the most magical feeling opioids and had an afterglow that lasted all day keeping me in a good mood. I see why this is alot of people's favorite. 10/10  

Oxymorphone - Oh my god... I never felt like I did when I did opana before. That was the euphoria that people chase for the rest of their opioid careers and holy shit it was so good. Just a freight train of pure euphoria ran me over. I also had to make sure I was breathing enough and was ready to have my buddy drive to the walgreens to get some nalaxone because I kept getting higher and higher for like 90 minutes. I took 35mg ER split into pieces and didn't know how much the time release would affect how it hit me and what would be safe even though I knew the conversion of potency from oxycodone to oxymorph. BTW sorry guys, don't hate me for eating it, I was just too lazy to put in the work to break the abuse protection, plus god knows I didn't need that much opana after how awesome it was. It was the first opioid to give me legit craving for a few days after one use. It was just perfect, I can only imagine slamming it (don't wanna know until I'm on my deathbed, I don't trust myself enough with that). 11/10   

Anyways my little adventure is over. I am still content with just having kratom in my life cuz I would like to avoid those withdrawals and the complete grip opioids can have on your life. I shall not order any more internet opioids because they are just too easy to get. Anyways I hope somebody enjoyed this, I spent way too long on it lol

Today I came clean to my mom who told me last month that if I used again I would be put out on the street. For the past month I have used in secret, sold literally everything I have except for a couple changes of clothes and my bed at her house, I have stolen from her, pawned my engagement ring, and all the other jewelry I have. I have realized anyone “in the game” I thought was my friend was not and have been used by every single one of them. The best past week I have wanted to kill myself every time I wasn’t high (which was getting harder and harder to do) so I decided yesterday was my last day. Today has been complete hell except for the fact that I had a 10th or a suboxone left. I’m in pain, eyes watering, nose running, extremely tired, depressed, anxious, goosebumps, sweats, and stomach cramps. But I am making this the last time I go through this shit. I cannot go on living everyday either suicidal or selling stolen stuff for the high. 

I have previously had alcohol and benzo addiction and went to treatment for a month and came home and stayed clean for 1.5 years. I was able to finish my Masters and get a good job and live on my own. I would go to 12 step meetings a few times a week and had a sponsor I worked the 12 steps with. 

Then I was introduced to heroin. The first time I tried it my boyfriend at the time shot me up. That was in October. I have been using on and off since then. It usually takes about .3 to get me high. So since October I have been to treatment 2 times, sober living once, tried opioid maintenance therapy with suboxone, and 12 steps. I could not stay clean. The longest run I’ve had was 85 days. I have lost 3 apartments, 1 job, a brand new car, all my furniture, all my electronics, all my jewelry, most of my clothes, and a lot of friends. I have nothing left to give heroin. 

If anyone out there is willing to help me get through this it would be much appreciated. I just need someone to talk to (and I do see a therapist weekly but she really doesn’t understand 1st hand what this is like). Any books, tv shows, movies, etc that can help me through this process would be much appreciated. Everyone I know is DONE with me (except my mom being willing to give me one last chance). I just need to know that it gets better and that it is possible. 

A little backstory: I am diagnosed with narcolepsy, depression, panic disorder, anxiety disorder, and ADD. The heroin really helped me self medicate the depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. The heroin also surprisingly helped a lot with my narcolepsy (which you can search online about the studies being done with opiates and narcolepsy to see that it isn’t total bullshit).

I would have to sit up and let my arm down to get feeling back and to relieve the pain and go back to sleep and wake up from pain again like an hour or two after.

Anyone else get neuropathy in your hands or feet from use?  My legs and feet would also swell up, but the pain was only in my hands bad. Any idea on what causes this?

I tried looking it up in a few different variations of terms but couldn’t find an answer.

Last Sunday I was looking for a vein and tried one on my left hand between my pinky and ring finger, and basically just went in and poked a nerve right there. You know when you hit a hand nerve/tendon or whatever and it gives you a little jolt? Well this was the same. 

But then since Monday I've been having numbness in that left hand, on that side, it basically is numb from my wrist to the tip of my fingers, from my pinky to my ring finger, middle to thumb and down is not numb. So half of my hand, if that makes sense. 

I thought it was numbness from killing my left arm veins and loss of circulation or something until talking to my girlfriend who said prolonged numbness would only be cased by nerve damage, which reminded me I hit a nerve right where it's numb last Sunday.

Risk of taking?,"Okay so I’m in the hospital in a normal room. It’s my last night, getting checked out to go home tomorrow. 

Next to my hospital bed there’s a small dresser/nightstand with three drawers.  The bottom two are empty but the top drawer has 5-6 unopened sharps. 
No idea why they are there. 

In the top drawer there is an empty box of IV Labetalol HCI. I believe it was what they were injecting in my stomach to help prevent blood clots, as I also have those weird things on my calf’s/lower legs that inflate to increase blood flow to prevent blood clots.

In the same top drawer there are also 6 unopened sterile 
“Magellan 1/2mL Insulin Safety Syringes. “

Below that text, in italics, the wrapping says “Permanent Needle”

Below that if says:

“29 G x 1/2” (0.33 mm x 1.3 cm)

To the right of the top-ish text is also says in small font “For use with U-100 insulin only”


I have no easy way of getting of getting sharps in my state unless I go a state over to a pharmacy and they still give hassle, Iv never done it, just friends who needed sharps.

They haven’t moved. Since the day I got in the room, tomorrow will be my third day admitted, nothing in the drawer has moved. 
I’m in the hospital due to an asthma attack the weather triggered. I’m not prescribed any opioids and haven’t received any while here.

But, at home I do have some fire id love to bang. I usually have to use insufflation as my ROA due to my inability/laziness to get sharps. But it seems right now I have an opportunity to take one or two.

I’m just confused why they are even there, they are completely sterile and would obviously work for IV ROA of dope.
What kind of risk am I looking at putting 1-3 in my bag before checkout? There’s no cameras in this room and like I said they’ve just sat there since I got in this room.

TL;DR 
In hospital for few days due to weather related asthma. In the top drawer of my beside dresser there are unopened sterile insulin 29 G x 1/2” sharps. What is the ultimate risk in pocketing s couple of these before I get discharged tomorrow?

Saturday and Sunday. The hard days at work. A little reward for not doing any stupid shit throughout the week. Surprisingly enough I've been able to stick to those two days, haven't slipped up past that. And because I give myself a solid 5 days off in a row I never get even a hint of WD. 


Recently my guy stopped getting Zubsolvs and started getting methadone. He's been selling my the 40mg wafer. Last week I got 1, and took the whole thing. Didn't feel much. So this week I got 4, and today I took 1 3/4, for 70mg. I enjoyed that, and wasn't too crazy. But I don't have a lot of experience with methadone and have a few questions. 


So I know the half life is very long. Will my prior strategy of 2 days on, 5 days off work with methadone? Work to the point of not having any physical WD? That is how the bupe was for me, and if I start developing physical WDs after giving myself 5 days off I am going to have to stop taking it. I won't risk physical WDs/


Second question is about dosing. Like I said, today I took 70mg. I enjoyed that. My plan was to take the other two wafers I have tomorrow (80mg). However when reading up on methadone redosing I am reading a lot of people warning about redosing. That even 24 hours later there can still be so much in your body that you can OD. So is redosing a day later not a good idea?


tl;dr 

Question 1 - If I take methadone for 2 days and then give myself 5 
days off and do that every week is the 5 days off enough to ensure I never get physical WD.

Question 2 - Should I not redose the second day since it stays in my system for so long? Ideally I would take 80mg Saturday morning, and 80mg Sunday morning. However if that effectively means I am on 160mg on Sunday after taking that days dose it may not be the best idea.

I would like to ask you something: do many of you use opiates and the pleasures that they deliver as a replacement for sexual activity, or as a substitute that made up for (or more than made up for!) a non-existent or pitiful sex life and all the anxiety that that brings?  
Personally, I would go as far to say that opiated pleasures are erotic...it's generally accepted that they are sensual, but erotic? For me, definitely that too...especially at the beginning before the magic starts to go and you're saying, ""uh oh"" but that's a different story. I like the sound of 'opiosensual'.   
For male opiate/opioid users like myself, the sensual roles are reversed...these compounds are the lovemakers, and people like me are the receivers, the ones who can lie back and relax without anxiety whilst 'the other' does all the work.  
I'm no MGTOW, but I do not have the motivation to chase women for sex...and back when I did and was successful, I came out the other side thinking, ""that sure did take some time and energy"". I questioned the whole charade, even if the sex was good and the lady was beautiful: everyone's breath smells in the morning though, right?   
So for those who are romantically inactive, did you fall further and further out of it as the substances lowered your testosterone? Did you renounce sex with humans first, and then go on to these, and perhaps other substances too, to fill the sensual void left behind? Was it a really quick turnaround in a ""wow, these are better than sex! Opiates are my new love and I'm not looking back!"" kind of way? For me, opiates blew sex and masturbation away completely...and not masturbating or having sex intensifies psychedelic trips anyway, which is advantageous. I'd rather abstain and use the saved-up sexual energy to hallucinate that I'm having energy intercourse with a goddess anyway, than ride the endless merry-go-round of dating.  
Eros takes on many forms, the not-so-humble poppy of pleasure being one of them. I wrote in one of my notebooks: Eros ---> sex, erotic dreams and nocturnal emissions, opiates, celibacy and semen retention, erotic psychedelic trips, eunuchs, creativity.  
So, are you opiosensual who is in love with the poppy? Are you opiosensual but still have a romantic life? Or is it another mundane thing that does not deserve this new name that I've given it?

This is just a thought and wondering if any of you think the same thing or different?

So in the States and Canada there is an epidemic of F. In my town we call them Death Dealers. Thousands of people have died in B.C and Alberta just this year in Canada and by the stats this is the worst drug epidemic of all time Right Now. Holy fuck what the hell happened? I have a theory on how it started ( just a thought if im wrong i wont be surprised).

&#x200B;

So 8 Years ago in the U.S Oxycontin was discontined(2014 in Canada) and Docs were put on notice by the media witchhunt and Gov morons to be more stingy with Opoids(pill mills being shut down which fed most of the country  Pharma safe gear). So you have all these people used to getting there fix from a safe opoid of there choosing at a not bad price due to volume of product being put out.

&#x200B;

To put it simply i imagine this created quite a vacum and drought of opoids as time went on. Without missing a step the death dealers moved there F into pressed O.Cs and Roxys. Heres a situation-Youve been out of O.Cs for 2 days and sick, depressed and most of all bored, you call your neighbourhood Dealer"" No Oxy but i do have this other stuff and it will blow your head off"" without knowing the danger as F wasn""t mainstream back then you have a line. Without realizing you just done the most dangerous and addictive opiate in the world. Im sure many roads didnt go to well with the switch from Pharma Safe to pressed 10000x More potent than morphine.

&#x200B;

As the drought of opoids continued the flood of F Grew. Opoid prices went up which pushed users to H that prolly has F in it. Perfect storm for the users of North America. Fast foward to today what is everybodys thoughts. Did the Gov stupidly set up a lay up for one of the worst epidemics in History?  The Cat is out of the bag clearly but any ideas on how to help and do some damage control? Pharm Heroin clinics perhaps? Pharmacies giving free F test kits? 

&#x200B;

In my opinion Adults should have the right to choose what they put in their bodys, and that all drugs should be legalized and be able to buy safely in a pharmacy OTC.  Would addicts have to rob if they could afford their gear for 5$ a day from a pharm instead of spending 100+ a day? 

Whats your thoughts thanks for the replys.",1535212630.0
