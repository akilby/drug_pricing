You may have seen my post about being unable to chip next weekend due to not having childcare for the weekend. I wanted to let my dude know since I'm a reliable $600 monthly income for him and he holds my subs for me (also cool). So I texted, explained what was up and that even though I still get my cash that weekend, I wouldn't be able to make it up  to see him till the following weekend. He sends me a text saying to call him. And when I do, he offers me a g of tar and says not to worry about paying me till I come up next time. Sometimes I have a hard time understanding him, so I kept asking him if I was hearing him correctly. Probably to the point he wanted to change his mind. Haha. So the kids are going to the (other) grandparents for the day and I'm on my way to pick up!!!! Totally unexpected and out of the blue. I love when things fall into your lap, which is rare in this world. Just wanted to share with the fam. Yay for JJ and dboys who know how to keep good business. Happy sunday nods!

I've been getting through a few hundred mg a couple times a day for the past couple of months. I don't get the same buzz or euphoria I used to, the magic has gone. When I started, it was something I did for a special treat occasionally, for example on a Saturday morning, and it was great.

It crept up, and now I'm constantly bumping up my doses, chugging entire bottles of codeine linctus, popping 60mg codeine pills all throughout the day like candy. I've gotten to the point where I've already got my next CWE in progress before the the previous one has even finished.

I'm tired, cranky, acting weird, and I think way too much about codeine these days. I've got DHC and tramadol too, but nothing hits to spot like codeine used to. I can quite clearly see this heading in a bad direction.

I want to stop, or at least go back to how it was, because I've got family reponsilibies and I need to perform better at work. How do I smooth out the inevitable bumpy ride? I know they're going to be relativelty mild but still, I've got shivers, shakes, and mood. I get sleepy, achy, flu-like symptons every time I go without.

Junkie Jesus, My God, why hast thou forsaken me? Why art thou so far from getting me well, and from the words of my roaring?

2. Oh, Junkie Jesus, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent at 4:50 a.m.

3. But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Baltimore, and D.C., L.A. and Tucson, Chi-Town and Milwaukee, New York and Buffalo, and of course Hotlanta.

4. Our dealers trusted in thee: they trusted, and they didst deliver the bags, even on a front.

5. They cried unto thee, and as they delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not caught in the latest round-up.

6. But I am a junkie, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the normies.

7. All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,

8. He trusted on the dealer that he would deliver to him: let him actually deliver to him, really be pulling up, and then seeing, he delighted in him.

9. But thou art he that took me out of the sickness: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my bed, sweating and kicking.

10. I was cast upon thee from the sick bed: and as my Lord you comforted me.

11. Be not far from me; for the 5-0 is near; for there is none to help.

12. Many pigs have compassed me: strong pigs of Baltimore have beset me round.

13. They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.

14. I am poured out like the water in the spoon, and all my rigs are out of joint, and bent: my asshole is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; I couldn't bust a grape with a steamroller, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.

16. For pigs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me: they shackled my hands and my feet.

17. I may tell all my bros: they look and stare upon me.

18. They part my garments among them, and threw all the shit in my pockets on the hood of my car.

19. But be not thou far from me, Oh, Junkie Jesus: Oh my strength, haste thee to help me.

20. Deliver my soul from the needle; my darling from the power of the Panda.

21. Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns, the eyes of the Panda.

22. I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the trap house, will I praise thee.

23. Ye that love the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Chad, and Monica, and Taylor, and Amber-Lynn, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of D.C.

24. For he hath not despised nor abhorred the sickness of the sick; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he called his dealer at 2 a.m., he picked up and said, ""I got you, fam"".

25. My praise shall be of thee in the trap house: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.

26. The skeevy junkies shall get well and be satisfied: they shall praise the Lord that seek him: Keith Richards shall live for ever.

27. All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.

28. For the kingdom is Junkie Jesus': and he is the governor among the nations.

29. All they that be high upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.

30. A bag shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.

31. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.

I have in said hobby estranged out of jealousy because of how well I hustled / moved into things without spending a fortune (I did it for a fraction of the price.). Now this is all fine and dandy I've completed this accomplishment, right? I had my trip planned and just a little bit of money for H (though this is probably already a bad idea since the Nyucenta ALMOST got me off a bit.... I swear...hell that's probably wishful thinking.) So my Personal little hobby trip, somehow became a family trip... and I'm still thinking about cold copping a bit of H in a town where it's been fent. heavy. + Now instead of blowing all the money on dope I did something ""productive"" with a hobby and have jealous friends/acquaintances?

TL;DR by not spending money I REALLY REALLY wanted to on opiates I ended up doing incredibly well in a hobby of mine that's now made me estranged from friends in said hobby because they don't understand that I hustled so hard to stop thinking about opiates / blew the cash so I didn't blow it on opiates. + Now the thought of doing H with we'll call it 0 tolerance potentially around family.

That wasn't really a good TL;DR let's try it again.

Didn't spend money on dope, still got people angry at me?

I've been taking it for almost a week now, gone through a whole 8mg pill in total. Seeing as it has a half life of 36 hours, I probably wont be feeling any withdrawals yet(if I do get any).
I'm wondering if anyone else has taken this substance without addiction to opiates and if you got any withdrawals from it.

I'm also interested in anything all you might want to say about buprenorphine in general, I know it's not normal to use bupe in the U.S to get high, but it's pretty common over here in some EU countries. My opinion is that it's an alright opiate, it lacks a lot of the euphoria you would get from regular opiates/opiods, but god damn, the first day I took it I hadn't taken any opiates for weeks and it hit me like a fucking train when I plugged less than 0,5mg. That had me good for a whole day, now 2mg, 1mg xanax and some beers don't even get me close to the effects I had from 0,5mg firstr day and up to 1mg the the other couple of days. I think I'm just going to keep the last 6mg and split it up to 0,5mg's and find out how long I have to wait between each use to get that feeling 0,5mg gave me the first day.

We where up on business trip in DC. One night he wanted to go to Baltimore to get some work. I said lets just go to dc a place we had never been to pick up. End up scoring but the quality sucks. So next night he wants to go to bmore. Cause he has cold copped there countless times and i had as well. So are riding around and mad cops out. No one seems to have anything. Until we pull down this one alley everyone says they are out. Except one guy says he has us. We just gotta drive around the block to the stash spot. So he hops in. We chit chat i ask why so many cops are out he said people have been getting shot and stuck up. So we end up pulling down this one street and park up behind a car. He gets out to take a piss. Comes back in ask how much we want tells us he has weed as well. Tell jim we just want 50 bucks worth which we told him before as its all the cash we had on us. Then he says he has to make a cell phone call and ask if he can use one of our phones. We say we dont have phones on us. then he ask for the cash. My buddy who is driving ask where the stuff us. He says he got us. Anyway this mofo pulls out a revolver on us. Ask for the cash and tells us to give him our phones wallets everything. He takes our drivers license. Then ask us for our ids. Inner city guy doesn't understand that if you have a drivers license you don't need an id i guess. Because he keep asking for this. Takes our phones ask for our passwords. He says if we give him the wrong password he will blow our brains out. Keeps jamming the gun against our heads. Shoves the gun down my throat. ask for and my buddies i cloud passwords. Neither of us has one because we don't have it set it up he doesn't believe us. He keeps taunting us saying he knows we have more stuff. We don't. He won't leave us this hell alone. Anyway the damn thug puts the gun down to mess with one of our phones. When this happens my buddy jumps back and starts punching the thug. I freak out hear open the door. Hear a gun shot and run down the street. To try to signal a cop. I see some junkies at the end of the street they are running away. I realize i am pussy and i left my buddy back there all alone so i turn around. I see him running towards me. I feel like a pussy for not helping out because he probably saved our lives. when he got in the back and him the guy where fighting over the gun gun ended up going off missing me my buddy and going through this car door. Since the thug had taken a piss he had left the door open him and my buddy ended up out side my buddy was punching the guy ripped his glasses off but couldn't get the gun. So when my buddy started running away the thug ran away so i guess he couldn't see. Anyway me and my buddy see no cops coming. We are freaking out. We slowly go down the street back towards the car making sure hes not going to come out and shoot us. We get in the car and get the hell out of there. Thankful to be alive I'm never going to Baltimore again. I can't believe the cops didn't come. Why do you think he wanted our ids so bad did he plan on killing us and he didn't want them on our bodies? Has anyone else experienced anything like this in bmore recently. All he ended up getting was drivers liscence 50 bucks and my iPhone which i doubt he remembered the password to. Luckily he threw me my wallet back after he got my drivers license as he was telling me to get the id out. God bless guys made this throway just to tell this story.. ,1476585039.0

Quitting isn't as glamours as you think. The demons will still follow, no matter how many NA meetings you attend or how many months you spend in rehab. The itch is never scratched and like a hungry dog, will bother you endlessly until it's fed. 

I quit last year, some time late October. The pink cloud phase was amazing. A whole new life I thought to myself, in hindsight, it was pretty ridiculous how seriously I took quitting. I forced myself to believe that the opiates were destroying my life, whilst all along, it was my own inner dialogue that was crippling me. My regrets, my sorrows, my life in general. Guess you can say the jumbled cross-wired brain of mine has and will always be my culprit. Not a pill or a bag of dope. I'm the cause of my pain. 

This wasn't noticed fully until around month 6 when I began reflecting back to the days of active addiction and comparing to how I felt now. Wanna know something? There was no difference, except for being sober, that's all. I could walk around and say I had 180+ days clean, but deep down, still a miserable piece of shit. As you could guess, my sobriety never blossomed me into a respectable member of society, quite the opposite actually.

If someone is normally a very happy person, has a lot of friends, good and supportive family, a great job with a high wage, is doing fine mentally... This person, if they choose to experiment with opiates, are highly unlikely to ever become addicted. This personcan use once in a few months and forget about it.

On the other hand, a miserable person that has recently had a mental crisis, lost their job, broke up with their SO or have lost someone close, has very high chances to get addicted to opiates.

I will also mention that I've never thrown up from PST before. Immediately I felt better and thought that was the end of it, but boy was I wrong. Another ~1.5hrs pass and the same thing happens again. Luckily it seems that this time it's all gone for good and finally I fall asleep around 4:30AM. I woke up the next morning (today) around 9AM and the effects of the PST were still fairly pronounced, including the nausea. I  decided to eat a bit of breakfast and within 30 minutes I threw up all of it so my stupid ass decided to drink some juice which also came back up pretty quick.

I started intensive outpatient last week because it was time. We all know how the life is, and I needed a window to at least see that there's a way to be outside of the drug world and be comfortable and content. So far I love it. The people there are incredible, and my favorite part is all the infectious laughter in that circle of chairs. When I'm in there, I feel really good, I feel like combating this addiction problem of mine. 

But you see, they randomly drop a UA on one or two people at the end, which is fine, because the meetings are Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. This means I can use Thursday and comfortably get away with it. I've done this 2 weeks in a row now, and it terrifies me. I want to be able to let go of heroin for good and stop lying, but I'm not ready. It still feels like self maintenance, a mean of keeping myself in check. I'll be okay as long as I get that visit with my guilty pleasure once a week, but obviously this practice is very unhealthy and very concerning. 

So what does it take to be ready? I feel like I might be ready if I keep going to meetings and seeing my addiction counselor, sort of a way to re shape my emotional and thought habits into something more productive.

I was asked to post this as my own thread. So here goes, a copy and paste of the original reply. I am too tired to tailor my response for this thread. God help us all.

I just signed up a new account so that I can protect my privacy and address the OP.
I am a mother whose youngest son died on July 28,2015. He will forever be 23.
Let me tell you of my experience.

First off, I never did drugs. Yeah, that's right. A child of the 60's and I never so much as smoked a cigarette let alone did pot or anything else. Forget H. We, as kids, were too scared to do that shit.

Fast forward to the present. With my limited understanding of drug abuse, I failed to recognize all the typical signs of drug abuse by my son. I'll call him ""M'.

You probably will understand the deceit, lying, stealing and all the shit that is related to getting your next fix. I was so damned naive that I wanted to give my son the benefit of the doubt and couldn't face that his addiction was as bad as it was. It cost him his life.

Two weeks before ""M""died, he was spending it in jail for retail theft. The first week they had him isolated and treating him for his addiction. The second week he was placed in general population. I went to his court hearing and he was granted a conditional unsecured bail release as long as he had a place to stay. (he didnt) But I took him back because I was more scared he would die out in the street.

That privilege happened in my home. M's third week of being clean slowly progressed to where the need for a fix was more than he was able to handle. The fucking judge gave me a slip of paper with the name of a rehab facility that had a 6 month waiting list instead of placing him inpatient per my request. I was beyond my means to care for him or to keep him clean.

M shot up in my bathroom. By the time I realized that he was in there too long, it was too late. The bathroom door was locked and I had to run to the neighbors in order to get help into breaking down the door. There, I found my beloved boy on the floor with his pants pulled down around his ankles. He obviously was on the toilet when he shot up and now I had to find a way to cover him to give him some dignity.

The rest of the day was a fucking nightmare. Dealing with uncaring asshole cops, EMT's and cops trying to shove me out of my home as they were trying to resuscitate my boy. Me, in shock and in hysteria not believing what was happening in front of my eyes.

I live alone. My son was my everything. I love him more than life. I pray each day that God will take me. I no longer have the will to live. I have 3 other kids and they are so engulfed in their grief that they cant talk about their brother. THIS HAS DESTROYED ME AND MY FAMILY. My son and I were very close. If he knew how this would have impacted me and his siblings, I believe he would have tried harder to stay clean. He didnt take his one stint in rehab seriously and I was powerless to do anything since he was an adult.

My life is shit now. And as luck would have it, I come across this post. Maybe it was meant for me to find it so that if I can get through to you or to anyone reading this, it might not mean that my son died in vain. I BEG YOU TO GET HELP - DONT DO THIS TO THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE. This is a living hell that a loved one never gets over. We have to deal with the aftermath and it fucking sucks. I cry everyday.  I have been hospitalized twice due to severe depression and suicide ideation. I see a grief counselor every week. I havent been able to go back to work because I am a basket case.
PLEASE GET HELP.""",1476556730.0

I meet him at 745. It was coke. I know it was come.

He knows better. There's no way he really though it was dope. He doesn't use but he knows what it looks like. I mean come on. 

To my surprise he actually traded it for some nicceeee dark rocks. I was cutting it kinda close to when I work. But I'm really gonna have a good time when I get off tonight. He never trades out anything I don't like. I just have to buy more when he reups.

I'm going to outline the things that really bother me about it. 

1. There is only 1 right way: Why the hell is it that there is only 1 clearly delineated process to being sober? Why is it that if you deviate from this, even if you are happy and doing well- people will act like you are destined to fail and actively talk down to you. 

2. The people: At least in my experience- there is like a huge sobriety dick measuring contest going on at all times. People with sobriety act like they are literally superior human beings to those with less. One of my biggest pet peeves is when people dismiss every thought or idea you have because ""Your best thoughts got you here""- like you cant have ideas of value because you are in active addiction or early recovery. 

3. The prominence of its role in your life: I don't want to do drugs anymore- why the hell am I going to continue to talk about drugs and alcohol every single day? I'd rather just move on and get back to a normal life where I can enjoy things and not obsess about my problems and/or previous shortcomings.

Light at the end of the tunnel !!!!,"So I started college about 6 or 7 weeks ago maybe a little longer . I'm a mature student (34) but I'm certainly not the oldest in the class . The average age is probably about 25/26 The youngest being 19 who I hang out with at breaks and lunch . I told him about my past and being on methadone and valium for a number of years . He was totally cool with it though I haven't told him about my current heroin habit and probably won't unless he asks me about it . 

Anyway before I go on a long rant . My post is about EVENTUALLY getting my bursary !! ye-ha !! I honestly don't know how I've managed to do it ! It's been a tough couple of months as you can imagine as I've not went a day without some kind of opiate wither that be heroin ,DHC or methadone that I get every Tuesday from a friend that gives me 50/60ml it used to be 100ml and some valium but he's been cut and now he's almost off the valium and has been dropped about 30/40ml daily . Though he has cut himself and takes about 40ml. I give him a half ounce of weed every harvest as part of the deal . But I've not got a grow going at the minute but he's still giving me the done which is really good of him and it really helps me out especially during these tough times.

  I would of had his half ounce a week or so ago but my supposed growing partner fucked me over  ! That's gratitude for you !!! and I've not talked to him since and have ignored him when I've seen the useless cunt. I bought him an entire grow set up the whole shabang right down to the pots and soil . Then after a couple of grows he wants to dissolve the partnership as the gear box on his £20,000 BMW (daddy bought him)went so he needs the money to fix it !! The cunt didn't even fully pay for the set up I gave him not by much but I had to buy a lower quality tent as I gave him a Green Cube tent which is one of the best tents on the market comparable to the Gorilla tent in the states . High-quality zippers and really good thick diamond mylar and a strong steel frame that can support your body weight .  https://youtu.be/id-FtEgYZ48 Heres a video I made about the tent a couple of years ago . 

Then a couple of months later the cheeky bastard has the nerve to say the small veg/seedling tent I have 60cm by 60cm and 1m high was his as he had paid for it !! lol So I got the idiot told straight away and that he didn't even fully pay for the stuff I gave him ! Which soon shut him up ! I also think that because I'm always doing different strains and obviously some are higher producers than others and on my last grow I only got about 8 and a half ounce from it when I normally pull down 15/20 ounce I some how bumped him which I didn't and I was pissed off by the harvest as it was the worst one ever ! So don't do White Widow from Nirvana seeds if your looking for a good harvest it's a good smoke but that's it .

 I'm going to order some Chemdawg (Dinachem) from Dinafem seeds as I've grown that 3 times now and even won a growing competition where I won a £100 dab pen :)

  
 Anyway I went it to the funding office today and they confirmed my claim has been processed and every thing is good and I should get the money backdated :) So hopefully on Friday I should get just under £1000 pay off my debts and get my stuff back from the pawn shop which has kindly held on to my stuff as the manager asked why I was pawning all my stuff and I told him why and he said he would hold onto it longer so I didn't lose it . I phoned them up on Friday and told them I got my acceptance letter and should get my money this week sometime and he told me that was no problem and my stuff was still there :) 

  So this nightmare will be over soon ! As I've never been so skint in my life ! And it sucks having to rely on family who I'll take out for dinner to show my appreciation :) Also since I know I'll be getting paid this week my dealer said she would give me tick when I went for a bag this morning before college .So I went back this afternoon and got a tenner bag I won't need anything tomorrow (done) and I'll get a bag on Wed/Thursday so it'll only be £30 all in . Though I hate getting credit but needs must ! So I hope everyone is having a good day and you've made it this far into my lil rant ! Also hope if you're in Wd junky Jesus lends a hand. Hae a good one Lads and Lassies all the best from Scotland ! 

Summary : Waiting weeks on my college funding and it's finally processed and should get paid on Friday .Also my ex growing partner is a fucking cunt !   ",1476713520.0

10/11: last real opiate, 150mg oxy morning
10/12: 8mg sub
10/13: 4mg
10/14: 4mg
10/15: 2mg
10/16: 2mg
10/17: planning to drop to 1mg

I'm doing well and pretty much symptom free at this point, the first 2 days on subs were rough though. My plan Is to drop to 1mg tomorrow. I also have a bunch of  ~0.5mg slivers. Anyone have recommendations as to how long I need/should use these two smaller amounts? I'd like to do this as painlessly as possible, but I don't want to spend a bunch more time on sub if I can avoid it as I want to be 100% clean and don't want my brain hooked on sub.

After all of that worrying, phone calls, considering trying to sneak my medication into a muslim country I decided to just be legit. Take my papers, my lockbox, and do it legally hoping for the best.

I went through 6 different airports round trip. And 3 countries customs searches. I kept my medication in my lockbox, unlocked it, sent it through the belt. That's it. Not ONE SINGLE TIME did any alarm sound, nobody even opened the box to see what was inside. I get the feeling that they are looking for bombs / terrorists and truly don't give a shit about your medication. 

I had all of my documents in the box just in case. But alas..not even 1 single question about my meds.  I wish I had words to describe the feeling of walking outside that airport once I'd cleared UAE customs. I need to specially thank Dan for the help. He has travelled abroad with his take homes and was the deciding factor in me just being totally legit. I couldn't have done it without you guys too! 

So I'm hoping my experience might help others. If you have questions please ask.

I'm living with my mom in a new country and I don't have any friends to turn to. I've been clean since May. My mom is always super suspicious anyways and stresses way too much. She went away this weekend to meet up with her boyfriend so it was just me and the dog at home. I drank some wine while she was gone (I'm of legal age and she's ok with this) but absolutely DID NOT take any drugs.

This morning she found some loperamide in HER medicine basket. It is not mine. But she doesn't remember ever buying any. She forgets things sometimes and she knows this but says she's been very careful about having it in the house because she's afraid I'll take it or need it if I use. 

She doesn't believe that it's not mine and started claiming things like ""I knew you smelled funny when I came home"" and ""You look really pale"". I'm always fucking pale!! And sorry if I just got off a night shift at a care home and don't smell up to your standards. She's just making leaps to convince herself that I must have used while she was gone. 

I showed her my bank account stuff to prove no money had been spent but it's gotten me nowhere. She just can't remember buying the lope but it must be hers because I haven't bought any! And I certainly wouldn't have put it in her medicine basket. 

I'm so upset by this. She's gone to work now and I just feel sick. I can't believe I'm getting in trouble for her forgetfulness. Fuck. I know I'll never convince her but I just don't know what to do.

Anyways, if anyone has advice or just a shoulder to cry on, I'm feeling really lonely right now",1476699327.0

**Thursday**

I wake up next to a naked Brianne. Her body is amazing. Former homecoming Queen. She jolts awake and I'm hoping for a morning round two. She jumps out of bed saying she feels sick. She grabs her clothes quickly and dresses. I sense her regret. Damn that stings. I don't recall our hustle on Thursday. Too much of that nervous medicine fogging up my mind. I recall that I returned home from somewhere to find Adam - our good job, ""good girl"" girlfriend having secretly a dope fiend neighbor - sitting on our couch. He's trying to score some dope from the transient couple. Adam's  walking out the door as I find Brianne in the bedroom. She asks if Adam is still here. ""I think he's leaving now, babe"" I tell her, ""why?""

""Because he has some nerve pills.""

""Well go shake your ass at him and get him to give them to us,"" I say with a grin and a chuckle. Brianne gives me flat look. I miss her wince. We catch Adam and Brianne manages to get the two Klonopin .5s he has by trading him some roaches she found in the ashtray. Adam starts some rant about him being in control (as opposed to the drugs). I call bullshit and banter with him in what I think is a playful ""mean"" way. Suddenly Brianne glares at me. ""You're a fucking asshole,"" she says and marches toward the bedroom. I follow her. 

""What did I do?""

""You called me a whore and you were being mean to Adam.""

""I was joking, babe. What the fuck?""

""Well you're still an asshole.""

Why? She's seriously angry. Here we go. We don't really speak for a while. She leaves with Mick to try to hustle money out of him. While she's gone the transient couple reappear. For some reason the girl is carrying a few roses. Probably stolen. She hands me one and says she'll leave one in the bedroom for Brianne. I tell her to give me both of them and I'll give them to Brianne. I write a small ""I'm sorry"" note and place it and the roses on her pillow. When Brianne returns and finds them she says ""thank you"" *almost* sincerely but I can tell something isn't right. 

**Friday**

I already have money when I wake up. I'm excited by the prospect of not having to hustle and being able to get well immediately. I wake Brianne and say something like ""Hey babe, get up and let's go get high."" She snaps at me angrily for waking her up. What the fuck? I had plans to get  us high and then take Brianne to the food stamp office so she can apply for benefits. She seems uninterested and annoyed. I'm thrown off by this. I would love it if someone woke me up and said let's go get high. I feel resentment building. Brianne seems to be kind of trying to kinda be ok. She seems to go along with what's going on. She leaves to go buy our get well. When she returns with a sub she has her sister, Mandy, with her. Brianne says Mandy has a hustle that will let us get another sub plus some footballs. Sounds good to me. The hustle requires a few hours of driving and the details are so dangerous that they are **[redacted]** from this story. I finally get Brianne to the food stamp office about 3pm. When I return Mandy and I run the hustle while Brianne chills at my place. It works and I return home about 7pm to find the transient couple moving their stuff back to Moe's. Ok? Something doesn't seem right. Brianne leaves with Mick for about an hour and i begin noticing stuff the transient couple have stolen. My fucking Oakley sunglasses. My fucking boxer shorts (wut?). My fucking headphones. Goddammit. I rush over to Moe's to confront them. I beat on the door but Moe won't let me in. We have a conversation through the door which results in a lot of loud cursing. Lights start coming on around some other trailer's porches and I bail. Fuck. Goddamn thieves.  Brianne returns home and I give her half of the score from the hustle. She doesn't offer anything from her trip with Mick. I know she got something. Resentment. She still seems annoyed. I try to chill with her and she seems increasingly cold. I'm perplexed. She eventually starts ranting that I was being an asshole when I was trying to get her to go to the food stamp office and that I need to stop ""smothering her"" because we're not ""together."" Wut? Motherfucking wut? She moves in my house, sleeps in my bed, has sex with me, eats my groceries, we share our hustles, but we're not together? And why is she angry about this? I offer apologies without understanding exactly why I'm apologizing. Weakling. Sucker. Brianne sleeps with her back to me and stays as far from me as she can. 

**Saturday**

I awaken to Brianne milling around the bedroom. She seems happy again. ""Sorry,"" she says. ""I can be hateful sometimes."" This puts a little bounce in my step because I was starting to worry that things were going off the rails. Contentment. Brianne has a half sub from yesterday's encounter with Mick and she gives it to me within minutes of my rising from bed. Nice. I get a text from my dad asking me to come pick up an old stereo I left at his house from years ago. I'm excited by this prospect because I can potentially score some other things from around his house (we're not on the best terms and it's not often I get invited there), namely, my guitar. I manage to score the guitar and few other knick knacks from my dad's house and return home giddy. I come inside with the guitar and overhear a conversation in the bathroom. Brianne is taking a bath and having a phone conversation. I eventually figure out that the person on the other end is Mick. Jealousy. She seems upset. Hmm. Mick does have a wife I think. Brianne eventually emerges from the bathroom and seems melancholy. A few minutes later Mick appears outside. They sit together in his car for about an hour and a half. Nothing seems to happen  besides talking (I was peeking out the window). Wut? She comes back inside eventually. She seems more or less ok and happy. We chit chat. Eventually our chatting turns into a ""playfully mean"" banter. I'm enjoying this. This kind of thing is my wheelhouse. I make an offhanded remark about wanting some kind of unusual dope. Something I don't do often, like acid or moll, or anything unusual. Brianne immediately starts tapping at the phone. Considering it is midnight and we have no money I assumed she knew I wasn't serious. ""Who are you texting? I don't want some maniacs over here at this hour just so we can try to get something for free."" I see the look in her eyes change. Oh shit. She grows quiet. Fuck me. I leave the room and give it a few minutes and then return with some neutral chit chat. She seems distant. I should have walked away but I'm bored and feeling chatty. Eventually I see anger spread across her face. 

""Goddammit leave me alone. You're fucking smothering me. What the fuck is wrong with you?""

""I, uh, what? I'm sorry?""

""You really don't see what's wrong here?""

""Um, I'm sorry but I don't?"" I say. 

""Then I can't explain it to you if you can't see it.""

""What the fuck are you talking about?""

""You're a fucking asshole"" 

""What the fuck ever""

""You're nothing but a big baby you prick.""

""If I'm a fucking baby so are you.""

I realize I've been yelling. Really loudly. I haven't yelled at anyone like this ever other than my dad. What the fuck. A knock at the door. It's whoever Brianne texted earlier. ""Don't you answer that fucking door,"" I say. She gives me an evil look and marches toward the door. Some gigantic greaser motherfucker in dirty clothes walks in. I just stare angrily. Brianne turns on her charm flawlessly. I recognize her spiel as the same spiel she gave me the day she appeared on my couch. Rage. At some point the greaser motherfucker goes on a rant about ""killing fucking queers."" Brianne goes right along with his bullshit. Brianne has a gay brother. I want to murder Brianne and the greaser motherfucker right fucking now.",1476696885.0

This is my first time disclosing anything of personal detail in a post on here. All names have been altered in order to protect the identities of those involved.**



Cars without mufflers rumbled through the warm night's air. The passing sounds of young black men roaming their concrete community, oblivious to the existence of the trio of Redditors, calmed my already shaky nerves. The three of us sat behind a foreclosed fish market. Out of sight from any locals.
Christopher held up a needle of which it's contents held half - about 50 cc's of a beige liquid. He gave the syringe he held against the light a single, hard flick. 
He presented his earbuds to me, saying, 
""Tie this as a tourniquet - "" He stopped - Looking at the arm of the recipient.
""Fuck, those veins 'er popping out of your arms. They remind me of mine when I started banging,"" Christopher reminisced, smirking.
Next to Christopher and I sat John, another local Redditor I had befriended around the same time as Chris. We had all discussed dope in DC for the better part of a month before meeting up.
""Ready, Rents?"" Chris asked. He gave the plunger a little push. A cold sweat was coming on. I had only just decided to try this an hour or two ago, and now it was time to reap what I sowed through a year of using. This was bound to happen eventually.
My heart could be felt with hard thuds radiating around my neck.
I looked at the rig - A microscopic bead of sweat wiggled its way through one of my pores as on the top of that lethal, lovely needle, an orange dot of bliss squirted from the tube.
""Ready?""
""Yes. Yeah, hit me with it."" I said confidently.
Christopher brought the tip of the needle to the crook of my left arm.
A sharp throb resonated around my elbow region.

I look down, exhaling  air I didn't know I held.
He pulled the plunger back, and a straight line of blood squirted through the body of the syringe. This is a sight I've grown to love. Like the body signaling you in order to assist in it's own demise.
His thumb then pushed the plunger, forcing the light orange contents into my arm.
What the fuck... Where did it go?? What the fuck did he put into me?
What was in that white shit? Was there fucking fent?
The injection site itches - will I get a Goddamn abscess??
I don't feel any different.
What is that? I don't... feel...
The pupils encapsulated by my emerald green eyes shrunk to the size of needle points.
Oh my FUCKING GOD.
An uncontrollable warmth and bliss overpowered me. It start from my chest, rising to my temples. I could feel my veins carrying happiness throughout my body. I looked at John and Christopher, letting a low laugh resonate through my larynx. A goofy smile spread over my face, and I let my eyes drift closed.

*One thought invaded my brain, like a malign tumor.
I'm gonna do this one more time, and then I'll be through.*




**As I write this it has been about two weeks from this experience. My arms are covered in needle marks. I plan on quitting this weekend from injecting as my primary route of administration. I don't know if I'll succeed, but I wanted to write this as a cautionary tale to anybody who may be considering injecting. It's the most lovely feeling, and you'll destroy your body - or yourself -the more you do it. I'd appreciate feedback highly, as this is the first piece of short writing I've published online.

He's been struggling between being clean and using for a long time now. He lives with his alcoholic mother, has two cats, and goes to work. That's pretty much his life. Well, on Monday I caught him stealing $100 out of my purse in the middle of our lunch rush. I slapped him upside the head twice (once for taking it, and once for giving it to his dealer in the alley), and was forced to fire him. I didn't want to lose him. He's brilliant in the kitchen and hands down the best friend I have. I love the man. He's absurdly intelligent, as well as deeply caring and perceptive. I pretty much have to relearn my job because I was so used to him working at my side, all while mourning the loss of my right hand. 

Long story short, he went missing for a couple of days after. I was distraught. His mom was distraught. Our coworkers were concerned, but they weren't terribly close with the guy. He resurfaces later in the week, said he went to a safe place and locked the door and wrote in a journal I gave him. Passes the drug test his mom gave him. Apparently wasn't using when he disappeared, and is committed to changing his life. Sweet. Super glad you're not dead or incoherent in a gutter. 

And now... Now without work, his life is just his cats and his alcoholic crazy mother, and withdrawals. Cravings. Being trapped in a shitty situation for his own good? But I don't think it's much of a life. Is there anything I can do to help him? I know literally nothing about heroin except it consumes you. He says he wants to go back to school but that'll be months away. He's seeing a councilor, and passing drug tests and... Is completely miserable. She won't let him out of her sight like at all. And his cravings are consuming. I don't know if I can get him anything that'll help. He keeps pleading that he wants to be done with it, so I'm here to support him, but I have no clue how to do it. I feel like I condemned him to home prison when I fired him. I miss him so much during my shift it hurts, but when I see him after work, it's like I'm talking to a stranger. He's completely pulled in, irritable, distant. This shit sucks. So I'm asking the experts: is there any way to help make his DT a more... pleasant experience? I guess that's what I'm after. I just don't know what to do. Thanks in advanced for any advice. I have no idea what I'm doing.",1476677106.0

But hope is for presidents, and dreams are for people who are sleeping.","It's been years since I honestly felt euphoria from any drugs, at all. The past three years I've been going to a methadone clinic, and sadly have gotten myself up to a pretty high dose, even for people at the clinic. Even if I went cold turkey off methadone for a week my tolerance is so high I doubt anything but a huge amount of h would get me High. My opiate receptors are totally fried. Hate being on methadone and couldn't make it through two days without it. So I had to basically give up opiates as a way to feel good. 

now before my opiate addiction, I had a hardcore Adderall and Vyvanse addiction. I'm talking 200+mg a day, sometimes weeks in a row. I quit those when I got addicted to opiates, but after feeling trapped with the methadone, I occasionally mess with uppers. Honestly all I get even from high quality methamphetamine is anxiety, tunnel vision and concentration, insomnia, etc. No euphoria to speak of at all, and comedown are brutal, a few times Ive felt like going to the er. I even tried a legit 200mg mdma pill from the dnm and didn't feel more than ""nice and a little content"". 

so basically I do drugs not even to get high anymore, just to keep withdrawals away and constantly run from my feelings. Im extremely numb, you guys know how it feels, music has lost its magic (I remember on stimulants how amazing music used to sound, now it causes me too much anxiety to even listen to it) I don't ever want to go out, I've pushed all my friends away, I spend most of my time in my room reading or sleeping. I've gained a lot of weight, and despite always having a beautiful girlfriend since highschool, and never having any problems when it came to sex, I haven't even kissed a girl for 2 years. I went from 5 years with numerous partners to two years with absolutely nothing. Now I realize part of it is me not trying, part of it is getting fat, not taking g care of myself, and hiding away from all social situations. also I feel like it would be a shitty thing for me to do, get involved with a girl, because God knows there's nothing good that could come out of that for her. 

I haven't had a job in probably 3 years, I live with my dad and he knows the extent of my addiction and mental illness, and he just tries to help keep me stable and get me through rough patches with my depression and ptsd. he doesn't get on me about not working and being a bum hermit, but I know it hurts him to see me like this. Before drugs I had a promising future, I was an A student, a writer, did public speaking and art, I really think my parents can barely stand seeing their oldest son as such a deadbeat. I haven't picked up a sketch pad in years, no way I could do any public speaking, talking to the nurse at the clinic has given me anxiety attacks before. my two brothers who are both much younger than me don't really associate with me, their friendly but nothing more. both have nice cars, one works for the fbi one year out of high school, and here I am 23 basically rotting away. Besides the pain it would cause others, there's no reason I see to stick around. my life has become a fight just to not feel miserable. there is no spark in my eye anymore. 

anyways I just wanted to get this off my chest, you know, how I feel. I honestly don't think I'll ever be sober, and even if I got sober I'm pretty sure my brain is broken, and sobriety would be more mental anguish than managing an addiction. I envy you guys who atleast get to get blasted high and nod out. sure you may be addicts and have to fight sickness, sceme for money, hide your habit and more, but at least you get a few hours of joy, feeling normal would be the best high I've ever felt..

Since I have several questions I thought it might be best to collect them all in 1 post instead of replying to a bunch of different -and ancient- posts. 
So, here it goes... 

* Lately I've been doing some reading here, and I was wondering if plugging could be a good way for me to get the most out of my Oxy's and/or methadone. I get the common way to plug, but could using capsules be a way as well? Or is the big amount of water the essential part to it? My 5mg IR Oxy's are already capsules, but I could make capsules myself for the 10mg ER Oxy's and my 5mg methadone tablets. 

* On here I keep reading these numbers that people tend to use when they describe their stuff. For example ""I have 10 5mg/325 oxy's."" Where does the '325' stand for, what does it describe? 

* I just recently started with the methadone, as part of a pain management programme. When combining them with a larg(er) amount of morphine I tend to get sleepy as fuck, literally not being able to keep my eyes open. This especially worsens when combined with 1 or 2 lite beers (2% alcohol) I can't even take a third one, cause I'm sound asleep by that time. Is the beer, even though low on alcohol, too much in combination with the meds, or is this a common reaction? I read about people wanting to nod off, but is there a risk of unconsciousness when I keep doing this? 

* I get all of these meds scripted, cause of extreme and chronical neuropathical pain in all my limbs, as a result of extreme scar tissue. The drugs tend to take the sharp(est) edges off but absolutely not taking the pain away. Therefore am I looking for the best way to get the most out if them, I already snort some of them -which isn't the best way 'cause of the fillers- and that's why I'm informing here about plugging. Could smoking be a better option? Do you have any other ideas that might be helpful? 

Sorry 'bout the shitstream of questions, but thanks for reading all the way down. I would love to hear your answers, advice, suggestions or crazy ideas :)

I thought his death would've been enough.

It wasn't.

His best friend, another friend of mine, was taken off live support on September 16th. Same combination.

He said he'd use in moderation, but with fent, and it's analogues, moderation is often fatal.

It makes me so sad. These kids just got their degrees. Not even 23.

If you use ECP, even every once in a while, please understand the danger you're in. Your tolerance is too low to save you from carfentanil. No matter what.

I've seen an almost fatal overdose from snorting a small line, and that's even with frequent use. It doesn't happen immediately, but within 5 minutes, he was purple. He thought the small line he did was safe. Nothing is safe with fentanyl. No ROA. NOTHING.

Please, I beg you, stop.

The people you leave behind are left with so much guilt and sadness, you couldn't possibly understand. 

I only have texts and Facebook messages from my friends because they thought they were safe with snorting.

I really miss my friends.

All names changed to protect the guilty.**

**Sunday**

I'm feeling a bit better about the Brianne situation because I know I can get well today. I don't do much for most of the day while I wait for my get well money. I get a blue around 6pm and am feeling better than usual because I've gone without for a while.  Without much fanfare Brianne arrives about 9pm. Excitement. I was hoping she would appear while I was at my ""most well"" but whatever. I don't complain. She seems happy. I'm intensely happy, but I try not to show it. 

**Monday**

Brianne and I wake up sick. Prospects for a hustle are not good. We're resigned to moping around the living room with long faces. I know a connect that got good today on nerve pills  (local slang for benzos) which both myself and Brianne have a  weakness for. But no money. Suddenly, a car horn sounds out front.  I open the door to find Mick, Brianne's ""friend,"" whom she sweet talks out of free drugs and money. Mick asks if I know anything about where to get nerve pills. I tell him. He promises me one for my trouble. He and Brianne speed off. They return about an hour later. Brianne hands me a blue football and quarter of a suboxone strip. Fantastic. And holy shit, I did not realize subs and xanax are such an amazing fade. I spend the rest of the evening hustling more footballs. I make at least 4 trips to the getting place and earn a free one each time. Me and Brianne split all of them. I'm hoping this will work out in my favor later this evening. Someone tells me they have a bass guitar they want me to repair for them (just soldering some wires) and they'll be by around 10pm. I finally catch Brianne and I alone and I grab her and sit us down on the couch. I tell her that she drives me wild and I love it. She laughs and acts like I'm joking. I try another tact: ""babe, you know you're gorgeous, right?""

""No I'm not.""

""Yes you are.""

""No I'm just Brianne.""

""Well, Brianne is gorgeous.""

""Well, [my name] is gorgeous.""

She looks at me. We kiss. We kiss again. Mmm. Tasty. Someone knocks at the door. Damn. It's the bass guitar guy. I fix his bass and he pays me a few bucks. I try to go get us another football but it's too late at night. No one will answer the door at the connects house. I'm anxious to be alone with Brianne again. When I get back the neighbors have piled into the trailer and it takes me all night to get rid of them. 

**Tuesday**

Brianne hustles us another half suboxone to get us well. I spend my money buying us footballs. There's that fade again. People pop in and out all day. It's hectic. For some reason everyone needs a ride somewhere and I'm the trailer park taxi service (it's  a hustle). I spend all day yearning for alone time with Brianne but it never seems to come. Late in the evening, right when I'm finally about to get everyone out my trailer, someone knocks at my back door. Turns out it's ""redshirt"" from last week's story (see Saturday's ""extra"" from last week). We'll call him Kahn, as in KAHN-vict, because he's spent the better part of the last 15 years locked up on various trafficking charges. He's also ""banned"" from the trailer park by the landlord (hence his use of the back door). I've known the guy since the 90's and I'm cool with him, but I want him gone so I can be alone with Brianne. But, he mentions he has dope (meth), and Brianne is hoping for free shot, so we let him stay awhile. 

**Wednesday**

We hustle subs and footballs again. I'm starting to like this combo. Fuck paying for blues. I'm getting well for $15-$25 a day rather than $50. I'll take it. Some transient types (a guy and girl) that have been staying at Moe's come over late in the evening asking if they can stay in the extra bedroom a while. Say they'll pay us $100 on the first of the month if we let them stay. After some deliberation we agree. Kahn pops in the back door again. He has a tenth of meth and half a sub. Both Brianne and the transient girl want the tenth of meth. Eventually they convince Kahn to split it three ways between himself and Brianne and  the girl. Somehow in the middle of all that the girl manages to steal Kahns cigs and the half a sub as well. Whatever. Kahn leaves in a huff after his shit disappears. The transient couple disappear into their bedroom after Kahn leaves, leaving Brianne and I sitting in my bedroom floor. We're listening to songs on YouTube with my phone (cause I ain't got a proper stereo) and she starts singing along. Turns out she has an amazing singing voice. Nothing more attractive than someone with talent. She's laying on her stomache in the floor propped up on her elbows. I jump down there, facing her. I get right in her face. ""Are you trying to kiss me,"" she says. 

""Yes""

We kiss passionately. She stands up and says shes going to put on some PJs. She strips down to just her panties and a tiny night shirt. I grab her by the waist as she reaches for a pair of pajama shorts. ""You don't need those,"" I tell her. 

""Well let me get my shirt at least.""

""You don't need that either.""

We kiss again. She jumps on my bed and grabs my phone and starts the music again. I sit down cross-legged beside her. She starts singing again and I ache with longing. She keeps tapping at the phone. I ask her what she's doing now. She says she's making a playlist. I tell her to put [Danny's Song by Loggins & Messina](https://youtu.be/4FDcTyyXQb8) on the list. Eventually she lays down the phone down and I practically jump  across her chest to kiss her. We kiss passionately for a few moments. ""C'mon babe"" I say, pulling her as close as I can. 

""I don't know,"" she says. ""I can't handle a relationship right now. And I'm afraid.""

I'm basically holding her face to my chest at this point, as she's hugged up to my body. I tell her it will be ok. The status of the relationship doesn't concern me (at least not yet). She thinks for a minute then looks up at me. 

""Ok"" She says, taking off her panties. ",1476637607.0

The past two weeks have been hell. I ran out of my meds early then managed to find some blues but as it turns out I think they were fake. Tasted weird, almost a little sweet with some chemical taste. They looked totally legit and everything. So once I did those and realized they were fake I have been sticking it out the past week. It was HORRIBLE. Thank goodness I went to the pharmacy yesterday and was able to fill my scripts without any problem. The pharmacies in my city do not really stock oxycodone, especially the 15 mg, and 240 of them. It can be hard to find, though I've been lucky. There is one pharmacy in town that seems to always have it. Even when I fill my rx of 240 and my husband goes in the next day to fill his 180 they seem to always have it. Thank you to to the Walgreens gods. On top of it, Sunday night, just hours before I could pick up my fill, I had my wallet stolen so they legit took all of my money. Thank god for this new app Blink Health. Took my rx price down from $300 to $70. Anyone without insurance I would recommend trying this app. Been a huge saver for me! ",1476806283.0

Please excuse me if this is poorly written. It's been hard for me to stay focused lately.

Like many of you, I'm no stranger to the rehab/sobriety/hidden relapse game. But the other day i slipped up. I looked absolutely everywhere, but couldn't find my drug of choice(heroin). Instead, an old friend gave me 40 xanax bars to pay off a debt.

I came out of a benzo haze sick as a dog in jail. Luckily, another friend bonded me out relatively quickly after I was able to pass my sobriety test. I was asked by an officer if i knew why i was in there. I said (more like asked) public intoxication. But no, I had been arrested with 30 of those xanax my friend gave me. I just got off of probation maybe a month ago. I'm in a very unforgiving, conservative, southern state. Things are not looking great.

Now on to the good part. I walk home from county jail to see that my motherfucking door has been kicked down and my apartment has been ransacked. Now, like i said before, a lot of people in my life think that I'm sober and doing well. My girlfriend, the love of my life, was one of them. We'd been dating two years. She had seen me at my worst. She's the only one who's always been there. The point is, I love her. More than anything. But she's going places and I'm a fucking loser. I think she finally figured that out, because she broke up with me as soon as I called her. 

So now I'm here, alone, sick, and wondering what I got myself into. She was so important to me. 

I know you won't ever see this. I know that you didnt always feel like a priority to me. I know sometimes I didn't seem interested or present. I'm not sure if it would make you feel better or worse to know that it was because i was sick and trying my absolute best not to turn into a mutant in front of you. You're the only person who has ever made me feel like i'm not alone in this world. You will always be the love of my life. I'm so sorry. That's it. ",1476801655.0

          Some of you may have seen me post a little about this before, a lot of you probably haven't. So thought I'd share my story with opiates. Just because a lot of people don't understand the risks involved with these drugs, and I am not talking just about overdosing, I mean literal health problems that can arise from the use of opiates in improper ways. Also have had my share of the legal, moral, and physical problems due to illegal and improper use of opiates in the past. I wanna share this so you understand that it really can get worse, but also that it can get better. A lot better! I mean my life isn't perfect now, nowhere near, but at least it's a lot better than it was 5 years ago.
	
         I started my opiate use as a 13 year old kid who had his wisdom teeth removed. My first experience was slight relief, than extreme dizziness, nausea, and finally vomiting. I remember the bright red, bloodied vomit coming up with a bit of the white residue from the pill still in it. Going back to the living room with assistance from my mom and laying back on that couch. I had only taken half of a 7.5 and remember thinking, ""Why do people like these things? I can't even use them for my pain!"". I ended up sleeping off the remaining high and never touching them again….for about 5 years that is.
	
         It was my senior year in high school, I was about to graduate. I had a great job working at UPS, a car, and was finally thinking life would be easy! That was around the time I met my best friend Jay(not his real name). I actually met him because he had just moved to my neighborhood after he graduated back east in the south(they started school a month before we did). He was the dude that no matter what, I knew he would always be there for me and vice versa. Well, at 18 I hadn't really messed around with too many drugs, besides cannabis which I used for a few years before I had turned 17. Well, he introduced me to alcohol. The nice part was his parents would let us drink under their roof, probably why that was hid drug of choice and now mine. Well, after months of drinking and such, we would get bored and wanna figure out more things to do. Obviously drinking and driving wasn't the best option, so we would look through the medicine and pills. Well, it started off simple enough, we would enjoy a Soma or two and found we now had an alternative to alcohol. Being young and stupid, this was great! Eventually though, they ran out. We had to see if there was something else in there that would do the trick.
	
          Enter hydrocodone. We found the pills I knew made me sick, but also had heard so much about. I mean it wasn't one or two people talking about them, it was EVERYONE! Like you'd hear it rapped about, hear it referenced on TV, even mentioned in the drug talks at school. I figured with Jay also willing to guinea pig it with me, if anything we'd both end up sick and laughing about it later. Wow was I wrong. These were 5's, and although stronger than the pill I took at 13, seemed so much more enjoyable. I mean pure euphoria, no nausea, no dizziness, no vomiting. I felt like I had missed out on actually enjoying them when I had my script. It went on like that for months, occasional getting high with Jay, then not for a while.
	
          I remember the night that changed all that though. I was 20 at the time, was drinking with some random woman in her room when I got the call. ""You need to come down to the ER right now, Jay is being rushed there, he's in critical condition"". I got up and dressed as quickly as I could, I was drinking but wasn't going to let that stop me from checking on my best friend. I was driving well beyond the speed limit when I received a second call, ""Head to the other ER"". I asked why and was told that it must mean he wasn't in critical condition anymore. I rushed over there as quickly as possible and got to the front desk. I asked where they had taken my friend and was told his family was already there. They asked me to join the family in the ""Quiet Room"". I got in there and his parents were both hysterical. I started crying seeing that and thinking my buddy was in a coma or something possibly worse. I hugged them and they said they were so sorry. I remember thinking, ""why are they sorry?"" I sat down in a chair and waited for the nurses or Dr to tell us he was gonna be ok, but that didn't happen. Instead, while sitting there I saw his parents both pull out their phones and start making calls. I remember first hearing his mother talking to someone, probably his sister, and saying ""Yeah, Jay's gone."" At the same time while these words flow through my head like a foreign language, I hear, ""Jay's dead, he's not coming back"" coming from his father probably speaking to his father, about his grandson. It all hit me like a ton of bricks. I couldn't believe it, he was gone.
	
         The reason I included all this, is because this is what had pushed me over that edge. Making my occasional use of opiates turn into an actual coping mechanism. It was during the days leading up to the funeral that I remember switching my Tylenol 3's for some hydromorphone. One of the other people who had been involved in the accident that killed my best friend wanted something like Tylenol 3's to help his pain, and traded me all his hydromorphone for my script I had gotten for smashing my eyebrow open by accident. I realized that stronger opiates meant numbing that feeling a bit more. My friend was dead, and the more I used the opiates, the more I could handle it. It went on like that for months and months, until I met my ex girlfriend. She tried to get me clean, and actually did for a while. I ended up relapsing when we had our issues, and got clean once again. At the time I was with her I developed an actual pain condition due to some back injury I had suffered years before at UPS. I used them correctly with her, as she worried I would abuse them and I didn't wanna prove her right. But eventually that all fell apart as well. I ended up moving out and living in my dead best friend's room of all places. His parents loved me like a son and wanted me to have a place to stay when I was no longer living with my ex. 
	
         Well dealing with a breakup, living in your dead best friend's room, and not having a job can really bring you down. I started drinking quite a bit. I had lots of opiates, but they weren't ones I could get ""high"" from, or at least that's what I thought. My morphine bottles piled up as I wasn't getting as much relief from those as my oxycodone. It wasn't until one night while hanging out with some paramedics that the whole morphine situation changed. I had mentioned that I had tons of the pills, but wasn't getting much relief from them. It was the same drug they had given in way smaller doses to patients in pain, but was oral. So they said, ""why don't we just run an I.V. bag and break up a pill to dose you that way. You may actually enjoy it then!"" Well, it worked! I was vomiting how high I was, but now I enjoyed the feelings too much to let a little nausea ruin it for me. I realized after the initial vomiting I was just high, no longer sick.
	
         This was the start of my true addiction. I now realized my hundreds of pills meant a long time I could get really high. I learned how to inject them, so soon enough I picked up how to inject myself. I ended up going through all my morphine over the course of a few months. Then moved on to buying it off the streets. I would use fentanyl lollipops as well. Anything to make life a bit more tolerable. Slowly that addiction caused me to need to leave the place I was staying. I moved in with some friends, people who didn't really care what I did, as long as I didn't bother them with it. My addiction got worse and worse, eventually I was shooting OC 80's. I remember I got an infection in my hand where I shot and missed or used a needle that wasn't too clean. my hand swelled up like a ballon. It was so nasty that I decided to fix it myself. I put a whole in my skin with a needle and squeezed. Sure enough I was able to actually drain it. I was mortified that it wasn't swelling, but pus.
	
          I started getting chest pains and such days to weeks after that. I figured I would go to an ER and get it checked out, worst case get some pain pills and be on my way. I was wrong though. Turned out the pains were because something was wrong. I had Endocarditis. An infection of the heart lining that comes from an infection gaining access to the blood stream. This is usually found in people who abuse IV drugs, or have heart issues and get major dental work or something of that nature. They checked me into the hospital, and told me I would have to remain for 6 weeks. Now, it's hard enough to sit in a hospital for days on end with nothing to do. Add in being treated like a junkie and it's unbearable. Every last Dr and nurse seeing me would treat me like I was so far below them, I was barely worth acknowledging. I would ask for something for the pain, the nurse wouldn't even make eye contact with me. Just would look at the machines, my IV bags, and say, ""hmm, I'll look into that"". She never would. I'd ask hours later and she would say she hadn't seen the Dr yet. It happened like that for about 2 weeks, and I had enough. I left back home. 
	
          I continued getting high again, and again my chest pain started to become more and more noticeable. I finally tried checking myself into a different ER. Hoping the fact that this one wasn't a general no insurance place, maybe I'd receive better treatment. I knew the drugs would most likely be the same, but maybe they would treat me like a human. Well, not so much. I was treated the same as before. While being treated with IV antibiotics, I was also buying and using oxycodone. I would go downstairs, buy it from my guy in the parking lot, then head back to my room to use them. I was doing the usual oxycodone routine, cooking up in the bathroom when my mom walked in. Being a hospital, the door didn't lock. Seeing her face, and watching her walk out without talking to me or staying by my bed side like she normally did killed me. I tried to stick this time out, but with no more family coming by, and already being there 2 weeks, I had enough. I figured I probably was already alright. The Dr had said she saw signs of it getting better. I was wrong again though.
	
         I got back home again after signing myself out against medical advice. This time though I decided I needed a change and moved onto a methadone program. Figured if I couldn't quit, might as well not risk my health anymore. So I did that for weeks. Started filling out applications and looking for a job. But it being summer, I was always sweating so much! Not just that, I was drinking at least a gallon of water a day, sometimes more! I was so thirsty. I also started becoming super sleepy. Would sleep all day some days. Never felt like I was getting enough sleep. I asked the nurses at the methadone clinic where I was being treated about the symptoms and they told me my body was getting used to the drug. I believed them and continued on some more. Eventually my ex came by and visited as she was worried about me. I told her I was fine and not to worry. She did though, and called my brother.
	
         My brother came by the following day and said, ""Hey man, let's get you home. Mom wants you to get some good home cooked meals in you and for you to rest."" I started walking with him and remember feeling so shitty I said, ""Maybe you should just bring me to the hospital.."". He said, ""That's where I am already taking you."" That was the last thing I remember before all my false memories. This was due to me entering a coma. You see, when I got to the ER this time I wasn't just suffering from Endocarditis. I was dying. I was yellow, like Simpsons yellow. My skin and eyes showing the signs of a failing liver. I couldn't answer questions right when asked as my brain was basically on autopilot. That infection had spread through my whole body, hitting organ after organ. Every major organ I have was actively failing at that time.
	
          They put me into a coma and told my mom I probably wouldn't make it. While I was out, my mother described my body swelling up like a balloon as the infection fought with the antibiotics and my body tried to recuperate. Then it slowly started to wither away as I wasn't moving at all. I was woken up a month later only to have my lung collapse, a tracheotomy performed, and placed back under for another few weeks. When I finally woke up for good, I was basically a skeleton wearing skin. I had lost the ability to move around on my own, eat, drink, even use the bathroom. I was happy to be alive, but didn't know what would come of it. Then I was told after all that, I would need open heart surgery. The vegetation from the infection had become too big in my heart valve. There was a chance it could break off again and hit all my organs once again. So they needed to remove all that and the valve to get me back to my semi healthy self again. I knew my chances weren't good, and when the Dr asked me to go over the forms I needed to sign for surgery I confirmed it. He said I had less than a 50/50 shot of making it, but I had no other choice. I knew that was the truth, and if I was going to die, I was going to die. So I signed away, and awaited the surgery. 
	
        I remember waking up again after it and being in so much pain. I also had this weird metal box next to me with wires leading from it up my hospital gown. I knew it wasn't a heart monitor, so I examined where the wires went. To my horror they led into my stomach! I asked what the heck it was, and was told ""It's a pacemaker."" I asked why I needed it and was told that after heart surgery, sometimes the heart takes a while to start beating on it's own. I remember each morning, some foreign(I think German) Dr came in, and would pull the wire out of one side of the pacemaker box. I would immediately feel like the life was being pulled from me. Like someone put a tightened grip around my heart and somehow was pulling my life away while gripping it. It was sheer panic and terror thinking that I would die while he was testing my heart. Eventually they came in and said ""The heart beat isn't coming back, we will have to implant a pacemaker to get that fixed."" I remember thinking that at least it was friday when they scheduled me for the surgery, maybe just maybe my heart will start beating on it's own over the weekend. On monday I asked them to check it again! He pulled the wire, and again I felt my heart failing. It was time for surgery again.
	
          This pain when I awoke was even worse than the heart surgery. It felt like I had been shot in my shoulder! I couldn't move my arm, shoulder, or even neck without such immense pain. I screamed out and they quickly dosed me up with something. They helped me along with the pain for about a week with IV drugs then moved on to oxycodone pills. I used them as I needed them for the pain, but my addiction called to me with the boredom I was facing daily. I started to crush them up, filter them, and then shoot them into my PICC line. Now, this was me being purely stupid as the filler in those pills is acetaminophen. This stuff doesn't break down in the blood stream, and can cause major issues if it gets in there. It's meant to be swallowed. Well, one day while doing my routine in the bathroom, I remember pushing that plunger than I fell. I fell hard too, straight on my head. didn't catch myself or anything. Now the nurse must have heard my head hit the ground because she ran straight in and saw me laying there. She looked around and saw the pill reside and gauze filter along with an empty syringe. She asked me what I had done. I said, ""Nothing!"" but then started to seize. I don't remember seizing, just laying there not being able to breathe. I remember laying on the cold hospital floor, feeling almost disconnected from my body. Like I could see, hear, and feel, but had not control over it anymore. 
	
          I watched as they pushed me on a side and slid that hard plastic board under me. They strapped me to it and were trying to push air into my lungs with a bag. I remember the male nurse who was bagging me kept saying, ""Come on now, stay with me. You're going to be ok."" All the while all I could hear in the background was people shouting orders and the alarm blaring ""Code Blue, Code Blue room……"" I was trying to blink or move my fingers to show them I heard them and was ok. No matter how hard I tried though, nothing worked. Then I remember feeling like no matter now much air they are pushing into me, I still feel like I can't breathe. It all started to turn black, like a slow tunnel forming of black fog. Eventually all black…then back to the chaos, seeing them still working on me and talking to me. Then again, the tunnel vision and blackness. Finally I remember watching them working on me, seeing them lift me up and place me on a gurney to rush down the hall. Then I was pulled out of the hospital and into nothingness. I sat there for what felt like an eternity, thinking this can't be it. I just lived through all that, just to die? 
	
          I couldn't take it, I didn't wanna leave it all behind, leave my family like that! Then I awoke. It was days later, they thought I wasn't going to make it. They had called my mom the night of to tell her so. They said even if I did pull through, I would be a vegetable. Yet somehow I came back fully alert like nothing had happened. Although I had a lot of explaining to do and apologizing. Finally I was done with messing around in the hospital, and they also want me out. So the focus became me getting well enough to leave. I had to learn how to walk again and get myself situated daily without help. Eventually I was able to walk out those doors a full 3 months after arriving there.
	
         Now you'd think that I had learned my lesson from all that, well not so much. At first things were alright, started getting my life back on track and getting recuperated. But my step father has always hated me, so I was forced to leave my parent's house to move in with my biological father. Moving a state away from everyone I knew, and living with someone who doesn't know how to be father really pushed me back into the drugs. I got sick and needed hydrocodone for my chest pain due to the cough, but my father decided I wasn't allowed to take them without his supervision. This wouldn't be the biggest deal, only he decided he would leave for over a day and leave me home by myself in pain. So when he finally arrived back and I could get access to my pills, I took several incase he decided to play that game again. That way I could get out of pain if need be. He found out though and decided to flush them. So the next day I found another Dr to help me out, this time I would go alone so he couldn't tell I had them. I found a Dr who would treat me and went on my way to the office. This Dr gave me oxycodone 30's though instead of the hydrocodone, and a lot as well.
	
         After all the crap my father had been putting me through, the fact that I had no one around to talk to, and staying in a place where I see one child treated like a king while I am shat on, I launched right back into my addiction. Sure I had pain, but the mental stress of that situation far exceeded my pain issues at that time. I went on like that for a few weeks before I headed to my grandparents place in OK to assist them with spring chores. While out there I used what pills I had, and waited to get back to get some more. I called my father to confirm he was going to pick me up when he decided I wasn't going back to his place. Apparently his girlfriend and him talked and I wasn't a good fit in their home. They didn't want an addict living there and with her fuck up kids, there definitely wasn't room for me. 
	
          I went back home to my mother and step father's place till I could get something of my own. I ended up renting a place across the city from them. I finally had privacy, a car, and the capability of letting my addiction lead me. At this point due after everything I had gone through, I was just over it. I got further and further into my addiction. I was going through 180 oxycodone 30's every two weeks, and then had to buy what I could find on the streets to make it till my next script. I did this for months until one day while struggling to find oxycodone, I made a new discovery. I had called one of the people I usually bought oxycodone from and asked if he wanted to sell some to me. He said he couldn't but had a friend who probably could, just give him a call. So I called up Turtle(that was his name) and asked about some blues. He said, ""Blues? What do you mean Blues?"" I clearly said what I wanted and said the other guy gave me his number to ask about it. He than said, ""Man I don't fuck with that shit, I do Black!"" I knew what he was saying at that point, but having no more pills or options, I said ""Ok man, where do you want to meet?"" I met him shortly after, he was a skinny kid with a shaved head. Looked like someone I recognized but didn't know how. Then while driving it clicked, we had both been in jail together. Upon discovering that, we both got a whole lot more relaxed and drove on to meet his dealer. 
	
         We pulled up to a mexican marketplace and parked. I asked ""Now what?"", he said ""We wait."" We sat another 5 mins and his cell rang. He asked for 100 bucks and I gave it to him, as I was used to dropping that much every time I bought pills. He walked over to a silver civic with heavy limo tint and hopped in. I half expected to watch it drive away with my money. Was thinking about what I would do, how long I would follow them, what would happen when I finally caught up with them. But the car didn't leave. It just sat there for like 10 minutes. No one got out. Finally the passenger door opens and he jogs over to my passenger door. I open it and he sits down. He gives me 3 balloons, two little balloons the size or a small marble, and one large balloon the size of a large marble. I ask how much it is and he says ""A gram a twenty, and a ten"". I was shocked, so much drug for so little. compared to the 300mg's I'd get of oxy, I knew this was a way better deal. He said he was doing this for me as a favor to our mutual friend, but asked if I could hook him up with the ten as he normally does this to stay well. Knowing the feeling of being sick, I gladly gave him the ten sack and drove him back to where I met him at.
	
         Now I found I could sell my own script and make enough money to support my habit and actually have cash on hand. I had a script that was worth serious money, and now an option to sell it. I started doing that for a few months, with a few reliable customers I trusted. Then one day I was asked to sell to a friend of a friend. I normally wouldn't, but he swore he could vouch for her. So I decided I would make the drive. I actually was going to go to the movies anyway, so picked up my buddy and drove. She originally wanted 6 of them. While driving she called me back and said she only needed 2 actually. I was a bit annoyed but money is money. I pulled up and saw her come out of her place and walk up to my car. I handed her the pills, and she gave me a 20. She apologized about not needing more, and I left. When I got out of the neighborhood I noticed a police suburban following a few cars back, but he was in the wrong jurisdiction. The street I was on was for the other city, but bordered his city. He followed a few cars back and kept pace for a few miles. Finally when we entered an area that was shared between the jurisdictions he lit me up. 
	
        I pulled into the near by parking lot and sat there with my buddy. The cop came up and said he pulled me over for a tail light. I said alright and gave him all my stuff. He walked back to his car and then 10 minutes passed. He still wasn't coming back up or anything. I told my buddy to look around a little, cause if a second cop is coming up, they wanna arrest me. He did and said he saw nothing. I looked around as well and saw no additional units. Then he said, ""Oh yep, there it is."" I said ""Where?!?"" He pointed in front of me while I was looking back. Sure enough a K-9 suburban was pulling up. It pulled along side me and then both officers approached. The first officer asked me to step out of my vehicle and asked if he could walk the dog around it and search it. I figured being scared and young that I should allow it. The K-9 officer walked the dog around my car and the dog moved around like it wasn't finding anything. I figured I didn't have enough heroin for him to be tipped off. Eventually the dog went into my car and still found nothing. 
	
         The officer grabbed my backpack though and set it on the roof of my car. He then went through everything and in my center console found a cocaine bullet! It wasn't even mine, it was my brother's, but he wasn't having any of it. He then proceeded to look through my backpack and found my scripts. He then started questioning me about selling them. I couldn't figure out at the time how he could think that, but later figured out I was snitched out by that girl(she was probably working off a charge for them). I denied it all and they put my scripts back in my bag, but then found my kit. They saw the needles and spoon and knew they had to dig deeper. Then they found the heroin. Immediately I was cuffed along with my buddy. I had to explain to them he knew nothing of it, and finally got them to let him go.
	
         I sat in jail for 2 weeks waiting for a judge, but they waited to prosecute the case, so I was cut loose. While I was locked up my mother had flushed my pills and so I came out with no money or drugs. I had to try and save up again to get my scripts going again for money, but couldn't do so before my Dr at the time actually got shut down. It was a pill mill type Dr office and they were cracking down on that hard. So now I was no longer dealing, just a junkie. 
	
        It went on like that for months. I even accidentally discovered speed balling that way, which brought my addiction into a far deeper spiral. I was spending twice as much money and selling whatever I could. I would steal, rob, commit whatever crime I needed to just to get the money needed to get high. My car actually completely broke down(timing belt snapped causing pistons to hit valves), leaving me only the bus and a bicycle to use. All the while I am doing this, the court cases I had came and went. I now had warrants, and lots of them. It would all catch up to me one night while riding back home on a bicycle.
	
         I was waiting for the light to change just outside the neighborhood where I was living so I could ride my bike into it and get home. I saw a cop sitting there waiting for the other light so he could continue the opposite direction of where I was going. Finally it did for me, I hopped on my bike and rode across the street and continued onto the sidewalk. While riding I heard an engine rev, and a car pull off. I only heard one, and it sounded like it just flipped a U-turn behind me. My heart sank and I just didn't wanna look back. It approached from behind and slowed down. I saw the red and blue lights reflecting on the houses in front of me and knew. I turned around and put the kickstand down on the bicycle. The officers approached. ""Do you know why we stopped you this evening?"" I said I did not, the one officer explained I wasn't allowed to ride my bike through a cross walk. I said, ""I did not know that."". ""Not a problem, just give me your ID and I'll run it real quick and send you on your way."" he said. I knew this wouldn't be the case when I handed it to him. He gave it to his partner and asked if he could search my backpack.
	
         I reluctantly said yes, knowing I was already screwed when they started running my ID. He went through it and found my kit. At the same time he saw all this, his partner pops out and says ""He has 7 warrants! Some are felony!"". I was cuffed up as usual. While sitting in jail that last time, something funny happened, I didn't have withdrawals. This made me think, maybe it's time for a fresh start. I decided to look into a drug court program to help me get clean. When I finally saw the judge she was looking like she was going to sentence me there on the spot to a bunch of time, but when I asked about a drug court program her whole attitude changed. I explained all the trouble I was facing due to my addiction, and explained how I really wanted help. She rescheduled me for an alcohol court program.
	
          Now when I got to that judge, she explained the program. I told her that I actually heard of a harder program for people my age(25 and under) that could help me more as it dealt with young addicts specifically. She agreed and told me she would speak to that judge about me. Another few weeks passed and I got to see him. When I explained my situation, he asked me to be a part of the program. I told him I would love to, but may have to go to another city first for my felony charges. So he contacted that judge and got them to postpone it all while I completed his program. After 2 months of being locked up, I was released to his custody for the program. Basically everything would be dismissed or dropped to a lesser charge if I completed it. The program does not have a high success rate, at least 3 out of 4 people fail it. But I didn't. I made it through and finally got all my issues put behind me.
	
         After exiting the program and handling the final closing of my felony cases as per agreement, I then moved away. Now I am in a beautiful new city, far from it all. I am also happy to say, I left that needle back behind me with those other problems. I get to enjoy my day to day life now without struggling to get my next fix. I don't have people questioning my judgement or actions anymore(well, no more than family or friends normally would). Things are alright now. 

Just remember, it can all get better. Just takes that first step of wanting it to change.",1476794672.0

Had an appointment to finally get diagnosed with ADHD thru the NHS, the UK's health service. It took me about 7 months to get the 'funding' for the appointment through the government. I then had to wait 1 month for an appointment for the actual appointment date, and it was yesterday. Mental health is completely fucked on the NHS. 

 There's a plus to the American way, at least you get seen. Fast. I don't care about debt anymore. I just want to be better. 

I missed it. Even though I double checked the confirmation email,  I got it wrong and now I'm waiting another month for another appointment. Everything's made so much sense ever since I found out I probably have adhd. I knew I was smart, but I had absolutely no focus. 

One step forward, three steps back.

The relevant part, is that I just took a copious amount of opiates. Probably a lot more than I need to get high. Not enough to die, though. 

I don't care anymore. I just want my life to end. I don't want to live like this.",1476791036.0
5833aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5833aw/is_he_using_heroin/,50,https://redd.it/5833aw,GarlicKeeper,Is he using heroin?,"[Serious] Is he using heroin? 

I would appreciate thoughts and advice as to whether my sibling is using heroin. Here is the fact pattern:

* He is mid-30s, was an H user for about 10 years in teens and early 20s.
Believe he got clean over 8 years ago via daily suboxone use. Also takes other medications like Wellbutrin.

* Was in a steady relationship for 5 years, got married, now is going through divorce.

*He has steady and well paying job.

*Early this year, was hospitalized for relapse on H. Objective evidence showed he had been using at least 2 months prior to relapse.

*At time of hospitalization, he left a short suicide note that he found it too hard to keep up the facade, that he could envision how he wanted his life to be

*At time of hospitalization, his wife was initially committed to helping him with recovery. However, they had no money / interest in rehab. He was in hospital 4 days and she said his attitude while there was wondering.
The next day he got out, she complained that he would not get out of bed, even at noon (this had been a similar situation in the two months of relapse, that is, periodic inability to get up).

* In May, wife claimed he was using again and she left him. She was adamant that he was using. He was adamant that he was not using.
From there, they basically initiated divorce proceedings and are in process of divorce.

* While married, she frequently noted his tendency to drink heavily and every day, and that she always felt on the defensive because anything she would say (on any potentially controversial topic) would instigate a fight and his deep personal criticisms of her.

* Once they split up in May, he demanded that none of his family members have any contact with her. He insisted that she is manipulative and a liar and that any communication with her would cause him problems with the divorce.

* In May, she did appear to lose it at one point and posted all over FB that he was using H and had been lying to her the whole time about it. He worked hard to delete all those postings, and noted that ""his coworkers could see it"", putting his job at risk.

* When he got out of rehab, he effectively admitted to me that he is an alcoholic. Based on my observations of him, he is.

* After May, his wife moved in with a new man, and he began dating a girl he met while in the hospital (apparently for a suicide attempt, not drug use).

* Divorce is being delayed because he insists that she owes him money. She returned the rings and a couple other monetary items, however she forged checks in the neighborhood of $1,000 in his name and he wants repayment for those. He makes about $50k clear a year.

* When she served him the divorce papers via courier to his home, he heard the knock but did not answer the door at 830pm. He said it was because he did not know who it was and was concerned it could be someone to hurt him.  Several months prior, as they were separating, she did come by with friends and broke glass pane in the door. She was trying to reclaim property inside the house and he had changed the locks.

* While they were married, she frequently complained that he did not pay his fair share of the bills, and they never had any money. She cleared about $25k.

* He is frequently very slow to answer IMs or calls from his parents or me. Often he will ignore several days of IM greetings. We are not a close family but we message each other fairly regularly and he is the only one who delays in replying. Sometimes after a week of no responses he will say ""sorry I was busy with work.""

* He and I do not have a close relationship. I attribute this mostly to all his lost years to drugs, and he has issues with me (thinks I'm arrogant and other things.) We also have an age gap and geography gap, living in different parts of the country. So we see each other physically not more than twice a year.

* Whenever he is at parents house or with me, he has a tendency to walk off by himself. He will walk outside and pace around on his phone. Sometimes he is talking to his (new) girlfriend, but lots of the time he just paces off. He will sometimes hang out for a bit of discussion about politics or something like that.

* Based on my recollection of how he used to be on H, I had a gut feeling that he is still using now (October)

* After realizing he hadn't been answering my IMs or parents', I posted on his social media wall that I found it strange and ""a bit suspicious"" that he would never reply or chat with us.

* Within 15 minutes of posting, he deleted it and deleted me from his friends list.

* I tried to call his cell. I called many times (maybe 200). He did not pick up once. Part of the reason I kept calling was I had a few numbers for him and wasn't sure which one worked. Also I was in a situation where I only had ability to connect with him by phone at that time, or would have had to wait several days. He never answered.

* I sent an IM and email, and left a voice message on phone, to effect that he owes it to me to reply.

* 36 hours later I received a long angry IM that he doesn't owe me anything, and that he feels I owe him a series of apologies. For one thing, I was blowing up his phone with calls at a time he was using it to create a hotspot wifi connection for his boss to do a presentation, and that I made him look at a jackass. (I did not know he was doing a presentation; mom sent a picture of him at around same time of him on a worksite, that he said he had sent at same time.)

* He said that I had brought up a sensitive issue in a group IM with our mom about his marriage and that he took offense to it (and had previously asked me not to bring it up - true), and thus had not needed to respond to our IMs. Indeed I did mention that topic. It was one IM among 3 weeks of IMs where he never replied to us. None of the other topics were sensitive.

* When I got his IM, I said ""Please don't change the subject, I am contacting you about your drug use.""

* From there, he got even angrier. He said he does not use, and that no one could have told me that he uses (I said I had a source), because the only person he is close to is his girlfriend, and she knows he does not use.
Other than my accusation, I did my level best not to engage in a ""fight"" with him. He went on to write things like ""the only liar here is you"" (I did not call him a liar), and said ""you have hurt our parents more than my drug use ever did, but you don't even see it"" (That was a response to my asking ""how can I believe you when I can't get any information from you? The secretive way you are acting now is how you were in the decade that you ruined the lives of our parents and me.) This was the most combative thing I said, as our conversation was deteriorating and about to end. He wrote a couple times ""I'm done with you. You're no sibling to me.""
He then called our dad, who was always his biggest enabler in our family. The next day both my parents sent me IMs to tell me to back off of him. I did.

* 2 weeks later, after no further communication, he blocked me from FB. And he may have set his profile to private.

I'm sorry this is so long. My hunch is that he continues to use and feels like as long as he has his job, he can support the habit and is fine with that. Do you think he is? Or am I just being a super jerky suspicious person? I've tried to be as objective and honest in the bullet points above. If you've read this much, I'm happy to elaborate or expand or clarify anything, and am happy to hear your comments.",1476787080.0

Ideally, it would be with a friend of mine. We'd meet up somewhere around town, and smoke in our cars in public hiding in plain site. We'd settle down in Costco parking lots, 24 hours safeways in the middle of the night, random street corners in city neighborhoods. 

Now that I'm looking back at a life I am moving on from, I'm sad. I'm going to miss using everyday. It was such an escape for me. It gave me something that I can't get anywhere else, and won't. Now that I won't be using, a part of me is going to be empty. I think it's a big reason why we're addicts, is because the substance will hold us when we have nothing else to hold onto. It is quite literally a lifesaver, and a killer at the same time. It's an oxymoron. 

I loved texting my guy, and the rush I'd get when he hit me back up, especially at a time when he usually isn't available. I loved to hit him up at 11 pm, go out and grab a 40 sack, and smoke half of it in my car in the middle of night somewhere in the middle of town. I loved it so much deep into a Sunday night when real people were sleeping in their houses with their families, resting up for work or school or whatever it is they live for. Just to have something to live for I envy. 

But I would drive, and I would hunt out a spot, and I'd slap on a podcast, or some music, pull out my foil, break up my H, and start burning. I began to love the taste. I loved the different dealers I would meet up. I loved learning about the business. The drug business truly fascinates me. I learned that my dude gets two different types of H, one premium quality, one not so much, and he'd grind it down to a powder and mix them up. I loved hearing that there was fentynol in it. Just little things like that that create a clearer picture of the drug world for me.

I remember since being a kid how I wanted to do drugs. I ate mushrooms before I ever smoked weed. I always thought the idea of experimenting drugs was inevitable for me. My friend, one of my best friends, happened to be a user. One day on a whim we met back up again, years since high school, and since then it was like we were always friends even when we weren't talking anymore. And we started smoking percs. I think they were 30mg... I was no good at crushing them, lighting it, smoking it. She would hold the flame beneath the foil and i would snap my finger when I'd had enough. I never got hooked this way, mostly because I never could do it myself, and those suckers were expensive. But this escape was so crucial for me. It took me away from my monotonous, depressing, kinda shitty life. It gave me something I had spent years looking for and thought I could never find. 

And I'm going to miss it. All of the different meeting spots that changed over time. The relief a line of H give me. I don't know if I can give it up forever. I'm kind of over smoking weed... I've moved onto the H. The H is what I got hooked on. And you know what? I had a fucking blast this summer doing it. Maxing out credit cards and working out scams to get money and doing shady shit. Well... that part I don't miss, but the feeling I got when I scored. And finding that spot to smoke at. I'm going to miss it.

That's all this is. A ramble. My withdrawals have gone fine. I'm going to make it, and I'm going to be ok. But am I going to have to go through this again? My friend has done it a dozen times. But smoking with her gave me something. It gave me a friend. It gave me an outlet. It gave me an excuse to listen to music and to get to know the city that I live in and I don't think I'd change it for the world.

581un1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/581un1/my_crying_keeps_getting_softer/,8,https://redd.it/581un1,avwnqwv,My crying keeps getting softer.,"The cycle of life is amazingly nuanced and the only way to truly begin to understand it is to participate in it.  When we participate in life we form bonds, both healthy bonds and bonds that end up hurting us.  For a human being, a bond is something that isn't always easily broken, much less something that should be taken lightly.  The bond most commonly shared in this part of the community is the bond with Opiates, and it's visible how strong that bond can become.  

At this point we've either all been affected by someone who has lost the fight trying to break the bond, or for the lucky few who haven't, are living on borrowed time.  Someone you know will die, directly or indirectly because of just how strong this particular bond can become.  It may even be you.  I still cry for the one I lost, especially when I'm alone at night.  I miss their arm draped over me.  I miss their ability to soften the overwhelming weight of what it is to be alive.  Believing, to be human is to fight, not only what's around us, but our internal nature as well.

As an adult I'm constantly evaluating why I feel the way I do.  When I was younger it was much easier.  I felt strong emotions, but I never asked myself why I felt what it was I was feeling.  It just never seemed to factor into the equation.  The only thing that did matter is that I was feeling *something*.  It was either sadness, or anger, regret, pain, or loss of control.  Just like everyone else.  We all feel these things.  

When we're children we cry out for our mothers or fathers.  We meekly reach out to be comforted, to reaffirm that someone out there in the **darkness** loves us.  We're rewarded for searching out through the **darkness** with touch and love.  When we're old, laying in our beds and trying to make sense of what we're feeling, our cries are much more muted.  They echo stronger internally within us.  We don't cry out because we're confused by what we're feeling anymore, we cry out because we understand it too well.  The pain is much more clear and in focus.  The pain is a finely honed point.  It's a needle, not a hammer.  We don't cry out loudly anymore because we understand there's no one left to answer it.  We are alone to deal with what we feel.

To break the cycle of life is to go against what we feel is right, moment by moment.  When the Heroin runs out and our bodies slowly start to ache and cry out, we respond to it, as if we're a new mother nursing to our baby.  We can't let the pain affect what we love and we fight back with the tools we've been bestowed through nature.  To ignore what we feel is something we've been systematically taught not to do.  Life depends on it, depends on our ability to understand exactly what we're going through.

To truly break a bond you must fight whatever it is that made you search it out to begin with.  Understanding what exactly that is can be difficult.  It takes some of us our entire life, for a lucky few it may only take a single conversation.  I formed my bond because I was lonely, detached and in search of the inner warmth that once fueled and thrived in me.  To replace the warmth, I had to restart the fire.  At first Opiates were that fire.  I found out though that the fire wasn't just warm, it raged in me uncontrolled.  It soon ate through any fuel I may have had, and it started to die, along with me.

I did understand though that it was the fire that sustained me.  It's what kept me wanting to understand instead of simply suffering through the cycles of life.  The fire eventually made me cry out in a way in which someone answered.  What was surprising to me isn't that someone answered, though.  What surprised me most is that the person who responded to my cries was myself.  The cries, as muted as they were, were just as strong as they ever had been.  It just took time to understand how to hear them.  It took time to speak the language that I was speaking without ever opening my mouth.

The stories people tell you, they do it no justice.  No matter how detailed Shakespeare, Austen, Tolstoy or Joyce are, they simply can't encapsulate what it all is.  They can only offer a small, fleeting glimpse into the core.  Life itself is a cycle, it's made of bonds, both healthy and bonds that can end the cycle completely.  

I felt I had to take the time to write this down to let everyone in pain, despair, loneliness or sadness know what I now know:  It may get better, or like we've all seen, it may not.  I can't promise you it will get better, but what I will promise you is that you're understood, and I can hear your cries.

I leave you with the only thing I've learned from a life of dependence so far:  Reach out strongly.  Reach out through that all-enveloping **darkness** and someone may just hear you.",1476763076.0

After reading many how-to's on making homebake heroin and finding out that you can use morphine pills to create actual heroin (in varying strengths depending on methodology), I am now intrigued.

In this thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.drugs.hard/1MdQUECUaRE
 there are many good points...one such is that someone mentioned that the yield could be as low as 10% conversion to Heroin and the counter to that argument being that 90% morphine and 10% heroin is still better than 100% morphine.

That said, lets say that we start with 30mg morphine freebase and convert all of it to diacetylmorphine (heroin), how much stronger is it than the original morphine? 

More points to consider:
 
The general consensus is that snorting morphine is idiotic and wasteful but nobody recommends eating heroin...it's either the nose, the vein, or smoking. So let's say we normally eat 2 of the original morphine tablets a couple times a day...this is your normal dose. Now lets also pretend that we converted 30mg morphine freebase into heroin at a 100% yield (impossible in this case but lets pretend). 

How much do you snort of the resultant converted heroin?

How much stronger is H over morphine? How much stronger would 
a 10% heroin and 90% morphine conversion be in real world terms?",1476757894.0

Somehow I haven't gotten addicted (no withdrawal symptoms ever. Probably some slight psychological addiction, but it's never been a problem when I'm on holiday) , but I am dependant because of the back pain I'm in. 

I am able to take breaks easily, and I just did a couple of weeks ago. That's just the context. 

In going to be having surgery sometime in the near future for my back. I'll be in the hospital for about 6 weeks and will be in alot of pain afterwards.

My question: how do I explain to my doctor that I have a tolerance to codeine without letting on that I'm a junkie? I'm afraid he won't give me any pain meds for when I go home. 

As I understand it, codeine requires a liver enzyme to be metabolised, so I was thinking I could fake not having that enzyme?  Say that codeine hasn't worked for me in the past. 

One more question, will the codeine tolerance effect other drugs like morphine? In which case I'm completely screwed.

I've always eaten them. I used to always bash the snorters for wasting their shit. I would occasionally snort the odd one in addition to my oral dose if I had enough pills but yeah, the main dose had to be eaten - until recently, that is. I started snorting exclusively somewhere along the line and became so doggedly hard headed about it that the idea of eating them became repellent to me despite all I knew about bioavailability. 

The science said eat them, my....whatever...said snort them. Then last night I got some OP's and wasn't going to wait until I got home to crisp them and all that so I chewed em up. 

I didn't take any more than I usually would of roxies via the nose...less in fact by 10mg.

I was *fucked up*. On the way home I was concerned for a second that I might have gotten fakes due to how hard the come-up was.

Keep in mind that I'll take a shitload of pills via the nose if I let myself (ie I have the cash) Last weekend I snorted 8 blues over the course of a day, two at a time every few hours and still never got as high as I got last night.

Whatever the mechanism responsible, whether it be the higher oral  BA or simply that I haven't used my first-pass metabolism organs in a long time or what, but this was not placebo. I wasn't looking for it to be stronger or had any hopes or expectations one way or the other. I was actually on the phone for the duration of the come up arguing with someone.

So yeah if you exclusively snort, try eating. I was pretty amazed at the results.

So what's the difference going to be like...All that I can find is that it is short acting. I was switched this, because my oxycodone dose was too high, so I'm guessing I'm going to be in pain hell tomorrow and for the rest of the experiment.

Is it going to help at all, 15mg-20mg of oxy bring my pain down to but once it wears off, the pain comes back.  

Is taking 6mg going to make me dangerously high or anything? Or is it going to nothing? Should I lay down in bed after my dose? -anything that makes it work worse/better?

Where I fucked up was shooting 40$ worth of great quality crack throughout the day to avoid the boredom and since this is the last day I could do it and get away with it since I'll be tested at the doctor's, it was hard to say no. My doctor is cool with weed so I have a few grams being delivered in the morning. 

As of tomorrow I'm STICKING TO THE FOLLOWING:

- 1 Subutex throughout the day
- Xanax strictly as needed, hopefully half a bar before bedtime 
- weed only

I really need everyone's support here. I've overdosed twice in the past few months. The last one being October 4th if anyone wants to look through my post history, a lot of our family here really showed me love. Yall are a huge reason why I decided to finally get my ass to the sub doctor. He's writing me 3 Subutex a day and three 2mg Xanax a day which is obviously way excessive but I'm grateful I have a few to get rid of now to have some extra cash in my pocket.

After shooting into the artery, i soon prepared a new shot.

A worthwhile thing 
I did not know 
They all say don't 
But I don't care
I run away 
So far away 
Only to be 
Discovered again 


He wastes the time
While He wastes his life 
He'll fry in hell 
And laugh all day 
He doesn't mind 
The guilty time 
Because he has 
His sadistic friend


Fall down the hole
My sad mad friend 
I told you once 
I'll tell you again
Don't heed my words 
You don't need words 
You need her love 
But that you'll never have 


Now he doesn't cry 
He barely sighs 
He steals the grace
Away from God 
With dirty tools
And happy nods
Only sustained 
Til sadness remains 


And by and by 
He looses strength 
With false happiness 
That's Bred within 
He splits the beans 
And puts them in 
A stew of saliva 
And cream of mucous 


Drip drip drip 
The joy is birthed out
Of the womb 
That resides in your mouth 
It seems all you hear 
Are ape like tears,
And Primitive fears
On dreary common days 


Now he begs 
Another chance 
But ants don't get 
A second glance 
If he's stepped on 
He will not wince 
He will not cry 
He Won't realize 
And that's just how 
He prefers 
To stay always,
An ant pacified 
And if he should 
Begin to fight 
The well dries up

58esqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/58esqj/just_had_my_first_od/,10,https://redd.it/58esqj,9millionmeter,Just had my first OD,"throwaway for obvious reasons. 

But first OD. Kinda scary, but kinda nice in a morbid way. 


I had just got off work and I was with my homie getting blunted at his pad, and got a call from my d-boy that he had some new fire, which was weird, because he usually never calls me to sell. But whatever, figured if he was calling it had to be fire. So me and my bro roll to my boy, grab 8 bags (4 each) and then roll home. 

-

So we're chilling, spark another blunt while we prepare our rigs. i did just 2 bags (normally do 3-4) and prepare to get fuzzy. [This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgW27hhLF6s) was playing in the background while I started to push the plunger. I pushed it in, started feeling the first rush as the music started getting 'warmer', and then it just kept getting better and better. Last thing i remember was feeling a little panicked like 'oh fuck, too strong! OD!!!!' but as that music gripped me, i got super euphoric and that panic went away as i just slipped into what i can only describe as some sort of god-like arms. Just warm and soothing. So i fade out in bliss and go into nirvana, then it goes black and i wake up to my buddy waving the empty box of narcan with a smug smirk on his face and him saying 'that shit really is fire, is it?' (that's why i love him. he didn't freak out, start crying/screaming or anything - he instantly hit me with humor, which really made the experience less traumatic and was exactly what i needed. yes, i almost died - but freaking out wouldn't have helped the situation. after all, i was alive, was i not?) He said 'i knew you were ODing the moment your head went limp. i was like 'aww jesus, here we go.' and jumped into action. just needed one shot, so you got one left, eh?' Not sure if the shit was laced with fent or if it just normally wasn't stomped to shit. My dealer is really good about not having fenty shit. so idk what happened, but it's thermite that shit is so hot. he didn't OD on his shot, and i do more than him on average. 

-

The one thing i love about this addiction is how it might end one day. I am certainly not planning on dying by an OD - i always have narcan on hand, practice harm reduction to a T (except test shots. those are going to be a new normal), 9/10 times shoot with other people etc. but i don't ignore that our DOCs have the best OD scenario of all the drugs out there. I saw a guy OD on meth once, literally the most horrific thing i've ever seen in my life. the amount of pain/anxiety that was apparent in him will stick with me forever. But i've witnessed 3 opiate ODs (all non-fatal) and they are way more peaceful than any stimulant OD. i always get so fucking bummed when people i know die of ODs and to see their families go through that much pain fucks me up. But i take solace in knowing that when people die of an opiate OD, i at least know they weren't suffering - which is a tiny bit of a relief in its own morbid way. That way that i felt when i was passing through to the other side was so....'good' that i can at least step back and appreciate that my best friends didn't go out withering in pain or freaking out. fucked up to say, but when i worked as a CNA before i got fired, i seen lots of people die withering in pain and suffering. so compared to someone dying of head trauma, degenerative diseases, heart attacks etc, i'd much rather the people that i love, should they die :( , die of an opiate OD than be fully conscious as nurses are swirling around them and alarms are going off and everything they feed off the anxiety in the ER. eeesh. brings back bad memories. 


-

anyways. Wanted to get that off my chest. super glad to be alive, but definitely was an eye-opening (more like eye-closing) experience that put into perspective what the big scary OD monster is all about.

I'll only have 120mg of oxy. I've had a lot of success with the coca cola method for turning for beating the time release. My intial question was going to be is there anything else besides coke/soda that works, but now im wondering if it'd be best to keep the time release in tact to keep my well longer.

I'm not expecting to feel anything cause of my tolerance but let's say i only need to stay well till around 1pm friday (im set tonight without the oxies), should i dissolve all 120mg tonight and have the drink ready in the morning? or should i pop them in the morning to keep me well longer? If i do the latter, should i take all 5 at once or space it out?

ps I have plenty of benzos (mostly klonopin, some xanax), immodium, trazadone, baclofen (non-narcotic muscle relaxer good for RLS), and propanlol.

how would you guys attack this?

DISCLAIMER: I've always been one who never believed anything out of the ordinary that I read on the internet. As much as I'd like to say the following entry never happened, it did. Scouts honor. I said yesterday that addiction is not glamorous, and this is a solid example. CURRENT ADDICTS: do not try this at home, or anywhere for that matter. 


To be frank, I'm an incredibly sexual person. I have a very healthy sex life with Jeronimo, I can get down and durrrrrtty when I want to. As the wise words of Missy Misdemeanor Elliot said, ""Aint no shame baby do yo thang"". 

-But I did my thang. And then some. Three years ago I was emotionally healing from a near death experience, I had an ectopic pregnancy and lost the baby and my right Fallopian tube. I was emotionally dead inside. At least now I can go back to using! When I found out I was pregnant I loved my little squishy ball of cells enough to not use, and then hated myself enough to start up again. 

Following that I immediately lost my position doing accounting, which was a great job. I just sucked at it. I'm not organized, I have the attention span of a fruit fly and at the time I'd rather snort pills off the bathroom floor than sit at a computer desk all day. 

That hit us hard financially. I was entitled to unemployment benefits but it wasn't nearly enough to get by AND fund my addiction. 

Disparity is a funny thing. When you chase disparity with addiction you'll find yourself in a shit storm of shit wind and shit rain. Raining shit where ever you go. You try to step over all the shit on the ground and then end up getting hit in the face with it. 

Except t  it wasn't shit. It was a 55 year old mans floppy uncircumcised pecker hitting me in my face. 

Ok I jumped ahead a bit, but I wanted to keep y'all interested. I'm just going to be blunt and raw. Excuse me if I offend anyone, but if anyone can learn anything from my mistakes than maybe they'll be a bit more worth doing them. 

I'm an attractive girl. I have tattoos. It took me all of my 30 years to finally develop some sort of self confidence and finally believing all of the compliments I receive. I am by no means a cocky person, I'm awkward and insecure. 

I'm a member of Fetlife with Jeronimo, for undisclosed reasons. One day I came across an ad for a website for models, people will pay you to take pics of you? $300 a hour? Why the fuck not! I made a profile. I uploaded pictures. My inbox was immediately full. Upon further lurking around I discovered it was an adult actress search website. For cam girls, models, porn stars and finally....private collection models. 

""Private Collector"" is the ""legal"" term for a Jon. Basically he can sleep with a girl, film it, pay her for it, and say ""I am a private collector and a photographer"" and be totally free of any law breaking. 

So I met this guy, I will refer to him as Needle Dick.  Needle Dick was seemingly a decent dude. Had a great job in the City writing for popular television series. He had lots of cash, and I needed it. 

I disguised the terrible things I did behind the facade of needing money for bills, for my children, and for food. Who am I kidding. I did it for drugs. Sure some of the cash went to adulting, but most of it went up my nose. 

I met up with the dude a dozen time. Easy $500 a pop. We were safe, he was gross, I was disgusted. I showed up high, used immediately before and after. I was numb. I felt nothing. No emotion pertaining to it. 

I easily racked up 10 grand with these ""jobs"". All cash. I put myself in god awful situations. I was a victim of sexual assault. All for what? Pills to snort up my nose. 

Drug addiction is as glamorous as a woman cleaning up after taking a facial to the face from a man she does not know and utterly repulses her. I do not want to go into specifics or details in risk of my anonymity. 

But hey, I was a huge piece of shit. In the posts I've written about my guilt, I was not over reacting or being neurotic. The things I've put my body through. I'm repulsed by my actions. Sobriety has really awaked me. My body is a temple and should be treated as such. As much as I broke my body, what hurts the most is the damage I've done to my psyche. I should probably see a therapist about this. But hey, I can entertain a bunch of people on the internet instead and get joy from their entertainment. It feels good to be raw. It feels good to speak about it. 

Have a good day y'all.",1477063691.0

Heroin is cut because if someone were to sell something that was even 50-60% pure, it would cause major issues. 

What you don't understand is that somebody OD'ing on your shit could get you a manslaughter charge or worse, a murder charge. 

Here's some scenarios that could easily happen;

* New guy that wants to buy a bag for his first time. His friend gave him a line yesterday of some 20% pure shit and he loved it! You sell him some shit that is 60% pure. He doesn't own a scale so he just decides to line it up like he did yesterday. Dead.

* Guy is becoming dope sick. He's shaking, sweating, in full body pain, and just wants to get better.He shakily takes the bag from you, runs somewhere around the corner to shakily put it in a spoon, loads up a shot as fast as possible because he's desperate, and guess what? He dies.

That's just a couple off the top of my head. You don't know who is lining up what amount or loading up a shot of what amount for whoever. You don't know how stupid some people can be and go ""Oh I've had pure before! I can handle a lot of this shit!"" and die.

In an ideal world, you're selling to people who are responsible and understand what they are doing with scales and test kits. In the real world, you're selling to people who are just looking to get high and don't give a fuck about anything else.

Selling pure is how you go to prison.",1477032389.0

This has been something on my bucket list, and now that I've knocked out all of the safer things, it's time to try this while I have the chance. 

I trust the person that I obtained it from, a friend who is knowledgable about darknet stuff. I have 250mg and five syringes in case I mess up and need extra product or fresh syringe, as well as a little extra to sniff to test. Are there any reliable fentanyl testing kits that I can test this stuff with before using? A small line last night suggests that it is not fentanyl-laced (it lasted a very long time, a long relaxing time), but better safe than sorry with IV use I would say. 

With experimental tries like this, what can I expect with ""track marks?"" I'm at the doctors semi-frequently right now and want to avoid suspicion there, I never seem to get any marks when I get blood work done though.

On the arm I feel most comfortable with, I have two semi-visible veins on the outer and inner part of my inner elbow that I can feel very well (I feel like these are ""rolling"" veins that I've read about) and two more visible ones near the center of my inner elbow that I can't really feel to the touch as much. Which would you recommend trying? I've researched technique and everything, it's just the actual thought of doing it that's a little nerve racking. 

Dosage-wise, I'm thinking about 1/4th of the nasal dose that got me comfortable to start, is that too much? I will have a trusted friend that will be watching me. Am I able to register the syringe plunger partway, assess my dosage level, then proceed to finish injecting without removing the needle? On that matter, am I going to possibly feel it hard enough at a lower, cautious level that I will lose motor control over the syringe? It seems like I'd be in control for the most part, but it was another thing I had a hard time finding about.

So Monday I woke up feeling pretty shitty, whatever. Figured I maybe I used too much (weekend user). I slugged off to work at 630 am. Around 10, I started getting super dizzy and started vomitting a lot. Asking my boss to leave, he said nah give it a while and see how you feel. (i work in a very small business, about 7 employees total including boss man).

After I wouldn't stop vomitting, I finally decided to leave around 11. Sickness didn't go away, so I called out and went to the doctor. Turns out I had some nasty stomach bug, only way i could describe it is having food poisoning with extreme vertigo. Anyway I ended up staying out until today.

So I go into work, and my one co-worker and who im closest to comes up and tells me what the boss was asking him the day earlier. 

""So...think he's on drugs? Heroin?""

""Nah his skin is too clean!""
 
My buddy chimed in and said ""listen, this kid is here way earlier then everyone else and is a hard worker. I saw him on monday, he was legit sick"" 
And that was the end of that. The others finally agreed that wasn't the case.

All day at work, my buddy kept calling me a heroin addict as a joke and I took it, laughingly.

To clArify why they jumped straight to heroin, they had a old employee who was a addict and in Pretty deep, would come to work early every morning and steal stuff to sell, score, and come back. 

If only they knew.

Now I thought that was outrageous *but* I heard from a couple of his customers that this is the most pure shit they have found! Which he went on to tell me was because most dealers will turn 1 gram into 4-6 grams! Then to top it off, they put .03-.05 into a stamp bag and sell it at $10!

Then he's worked with some dealers who he found out with just get 10-15 grams of Dormin and work in 1 gram of Fent! He never got on board with the Fent shit though so he never touched it again.

And i figured id ask you guys for your opinion. I'm an intermittent user of suboxone for cravings and such. I use it by iv. My last dose of any substantial amount was around monday - Tuesday ( 17-18th)  of about 2-4mg other than that I've done washes every other day due to running out. So my question is, for someone who doesnt use suboxone daily and doesn't have it built up on their system due to low doses and intermittent use how long will it take for it to be out of my system and for me to be able to pass a urine screen? The drug test is for court on both the 26th and 27th. so I'm guessing its not going to be a cheapo urine test. I've read online estimates of between 3 and ten days for bupe to be out of your system for urine screens.  Any help would be great and maybe some advice to flush my system of the bupe before my drug test dates. Thank you in advance guys :)


Edit: thank you to the few people that answered my question. As to the others telling me iv sub is a bad idea; I already know about this. So no need to waste your time trying to educate me on an obvious topic. I get it shooting sub is bad for you. But I believe if done properly with the right gear and know-how its perfectly safe.

What made me do it? I missed it. In vain.

I woke up to what looked like the scene of a vicious attempted murder. I was pulled up from my shoulders by a brute of a uniformed woman, disoriented and ignorant to the nature of the situation. My vision was doubled as I stood over the chaos. Before me was a real life night terror: a torn blanket, a wickedly displaced coffee table, a parade of officers, EMTs, my parents, all colorfully saturated in my vomit and blood. 

I learned my father broke his deep sleep at 4:30 in the morning with a feeling of dread and despair. He rushed to the living room to find me unconscious, choking on what once were the contents of my stomach. Now, they were the contents of my face and everything around me. Frantically, he awakened my mother and called 911. My frail mother found the strength to pull all one hundred and sixty pounds of me off of the couch to perform CPR while the police made haste to the residence. It took them eight minutes to arrive. 

When the police arrived, they took over, hitting me with a large dose of narcan in an effort to reverse the effect of sin. It did not work. Fifteen minutes after the call, the paramedics bursted through the door and did the exact same thing. After the second dose of narcan, I shot up and gasped for air. My frame rattled audibly, making it difficult to hear what was being said to me. The gravity of what just unfolded plowed into my with the force of an eighteen wheeler. 

The ambulance took me to xxxx-xxxx Hospital, the place where I was born, and later the place where I was saved, several times in fact. On the ride there, I regained some semblance of lucidity and made small talk with the EMT who had saved my life. This was only temporary however. At the hospital, my face became blank and my emotions blended together into an unobservable incongruity. I became incoherent and delusional as the narcan wore off and the heroin started to kick back in.  Every breath was forced, my eyes fought with my brain to remain open. This went on for about 4 hours until it was safe for me to succumb to the embrace and fall asleep. 

My stay lasted 4 days. I developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, most likely caused by congestive heart failure, an overdose of heroin, an overdose of narcan, or a combination of all three. Shortness of breath, elevated heart rate, a cough from the ninth circle of hell, among other things, took hold of my existence and limited me to a hospital bed with the inability to walk, shower, or eat solid food. The initial x-rays show severe inflammation of the lungs, which had filled halfway with fluid. If I had not internally kicked and screamed against a second overdose in the ER, intubation was my only option and, depending on the austerity of my condition, which I trust was terrible enough, subsequently being medically induced into a coma until I had become well enough to be awakened. Luckily, I was still sane enough to avoid this outcome.

I sit here writing this one week after the incident. My lung capacity is still weak, albeit better than when I left the hospital. Appetite is harsh and dwindling. I have lost eight pounds and an untold amount of motivation. Writing is my only escape. I have not told my closest friends for fear that they will finally sever the thin threads that hold us together. My discharge papers included information on overdose, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and interestingly, schizoaffective disorder. Though I attribute this to my delusional state of being post-overdose, I cannot help to think that something is wrong with me. I do not know where to go.

I started smoking weed, then taking xanax, eventually formed too much of a habit and was prescribed 6mg daily, then I found opiates. I have always had intense social anxiety and some depression, as well as always seeking that feeling of being at ease. So when I took my first Norco I loved it. Eventually you take Percocet, then to oxy and morphine and the harder stuff (Im not an IV or heroin addict it isn't to that point, I have accepted it can go down that road but I will do my best not to let it). So I was taking a lot of oxy everyday for the past year but really the beginning of what felt like the end came in march when I tore my meniscus and ACL, I actually hurt it and went on vacation before the surgery so after about 4 prescriptions of 30 10mg Norco, I got my surgery, and then it was about 4 more prescriptions of Percocet and Norco, and on top of that my oxy habit was still vastly in effect. When summer came around I learned I couldn't live without these motherfuckers. I kept taking stuff and buying off the streets and it was going downhill fast. Eventually, I moved up to nor-cal where I can't find opiates. I've run out of the stash I saved to bring up here and I was even able to take a week off with the help of my xanax (thank god). So things started to look a little up and I wasn't getting the strong urges like I did before. Then my dad died about 2 weeks ago of a heart attack, out of nowhere. He was my best friend, the pilot of my life, my hero and it left me in a terrible mindset, I went back down to LA to be with my family considering my mom had to get her thyroid cancer removed days after my dad passed. I binged very hard to cope with the sadness and I feel like I am right back in this dark hole I was pulling myself out of. I know my story doesn't even compare to the hardships some of you are facing, and I wish you the best of luck in that, but I just wanted to post this to get it off my chest and hear advice from people who have been through it.

The tranquil and soulful slow jazz from beyond half a century ago has a real special place in my heart. Artists didn't play their instruments, they sang with them.

58s7yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/58s7yw/shitpost/,23,https://redd.it/58s7yw,SlickStyle,Shitpost,"Ok quick rundown: 

I had a pretty good setup going when I used to use. I had a couple of using friends and a couple of hookups and life was sweet. Decided to take about 10 months off. When I got back all my friends had either gotten busted or had moved on except my one friend. Who I will refer to as A from here on. He has one hookup (very similar situation as me took some time off and few ""real"" friends who use opiates) and he is gracious enough to connect me with him. A is a good dude (and a good friend of mine) and I trust him. He also has no reason to fuck me over and just generally wouldn't do that. I found another hook up who was selling to me for 120$ a half and 220$ a G. I know that probably doesn't sound great to you guys but where I live (PM me if interested. Not throwing my state out there cause it's against the rules) it's 40$ a pt. It's fucking killer but whatever. Buddy with good prices gets pinched (for fucking petty theft of all things) so I'm back to going through my friend to his guy who refuses to meet me cause he's paranoid as fuck even though I've bought a lot of shit off him. 

Ok, now that we are all caught up: 

Scrounged up 120$ today. Put the order in for 3. Buddy comes by, grabs money, goes to asshole dealers house, and comes back. It looks light so I throw it on the scale and it weighs to .15. POINT ONE-FUCKING-FIVE FOR 120$. 3 POINTS FOR 120$ IS A FUCKING RIP OFF ANYWAY AND THE DUDE SHORTS ME HALF OF MY FUCKING SHIT. Of course I have no way to contact this dude and my friend can't do shit about it and doesn't want to confront him cause he doesn't want to lose his one connect. 

Fuck and the dope isn't even good. When I drew it up in the rig it looks like watered down whiskey. I understand that your charging me as much as you possibly fucking can but if you're not even gonna cut me a deal AT LEAST GIVE ME ALL MY SHIT. Fucking A I'm done with it and I'm barely fucking high. I wish my connect hadn't gotten busted.  Oh well me and A are doing an order on the DN and he told me he's gonna hook me up with 1.5 g's for free when the order comes in (he owes me some money for an unrelated thing) so needless to say I psyched about that. Should be coming in the next two weeks. 

Goddamn I've been doing this shit for like 3 years is it to much to ask for a dealer who at least gives me the weight that I fucking pay for?

I snort, pop and plug. No IV. I am very physically active, doing very vigorous cardio everyday and endeavoring to eat real healthy. I eat shit when I am high though, inhibitions all down and such :D

On day 1 I took 7.5g kratom, day 2 5g, and today, I practically licked about 0.5g after I wanted to try and jump, and that's it! Blood is flowing back to my extremities, and with another sleep I should be golden. The key is to stay active every day. I take long walks whenever possible, and I'm active to a god-like extent when on opiates. It was just causing me problems; just generally making me feel old and craving healthy food less, and wanting to drink coffee and do other stuff I never do when I'm sober. So I'm on this little T-break, and will let myself play again when I board a flight for a mini-vacation in November. Little 3 week T break here. Its been pretty easy since I control my use fairly well compared to some others I see on here, and I've been on and off opiates since about 2010. I feel as though, over time, I will ultimately have to pull the plug on this because I still think about when I get to have relief againn by letting myself use again, instead of living in the moment.

58rd85,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/58rd85/crazy_scores_and_scripts_thread/,24,https://redd.it/58rd85,moviedrugbuff,Crazy scores and scripts thread,"I know that there have been threads similar to this in the past but I'm making an October 2016 update with this one. Also I know this isn't totally opiate-exclusive discussion so I coulda posted it to r/Drugs, but idk, not to take anything away from that sub, but I feel like this community is a little more into the whole pharmaceuticals world. A few questions for all my fellow pill and dopeheads: 

1. What's the most obscure medication you've either scored a script for or copped from your neighborhood dealer? You don't have to limit the answers to opiates. Examples: Desoxyn, Fentora/Subsys/Abstral, 3mg Xanax XR tabs, Exalgo (32mg ER hydromorph tabs), Hysingla/Zohydro, benzos besides the main four (clobazam, estazolam, etc) Opium Tincture, liquid benzos (alprazolam intensol, lorazepam intensol, etc), cocaine hcl, barbiturates, solutions for injections (hydromorphone, buprenex, fentanyl citrate, etc), or even the elusive, almost mythical OxyContin 160mg tablets that were discontinued in the early 2000s.

2. What's the craziest combo of scripts you've been given by a doctor or doctors? For example, the ""craziest"" regimen I've ever been able to obtain was 5.7mg/1.4mg Zubsolv x60/month (1 tab 2x/day), 1mg clonazepam x60/month (1 tab 2x/day), and methylphenidate IR 20mg x45/month (1 tab in the morning, half tab early afternoon). And that’s not really even that “crazy” per say. I know there's tons of crazy answers for this question since pill mills were and are a thing. 

3. The single most potent script you've been given? Ex: I know a girl who's GP gave her a 90x 2mg Xanax script every month. ""Take one 2mg tablet three times a day."" Not a controlled substance or super potent, but at one point a doc had me on 2,700mg of gabapentin a day. ""Take three 300mg tablets three times a day."" 9 pills a day, 270 pills a month.

4. Ever found drugs randomly? Like shit you forgot about and found later while cleaning your room or car, shit on the ground, shit from other people's medicine cabinets, etc. Ex: I’m a shitty person and have taken from other people’s med cabinets on multiple occasions, like when I took an old 40x 10mg Norco script, an old 40x ?mg propoxyphene script, and an old 30x 15mg temazepam script from a family member… or when I stumbled upon old blister packs of disintegrating .5mg clonazepam, a single blister of .5mg alprazolam, about 10 .5mg lorazepam, and 2 unlocked 5-7.5-10mg Diastat Acudials (rectal diazepam gel) all in the same house.

Got any interesting answers to any of the above?",1477107342.0

Some people think it is a calm, peaceful way to go. I thought so too. But it is NOT!! At least my experience wasn't. I know depression and addiction all too well. I know the desire to just cease existing. I was so sick and I was tired of trying to keep up with a habit that wasn't working for me anymore. I just wanted to be numb. So one night I took a massive amount of methadone in an attempt to never wake up. I threw in a few xanax too. Just to be sure. Thankfully someone found me called ems. Narcan didn't wake me and my heart had to be shocked several times over the next few days. Doctors told my family I may never wake up and if I did they didn't know if I would have permanent brain damage. It was the most terrifying experience of my life. I heard everything while I was out. My family praying, telling me to open my eyes, squeeze their hands. I felt them shock my heart. Over and over again. At some point, hours after I fell asleep that night my body became starved for oxygen, as my breathing slowed. I felt like a fish out of water. Gasping for air. Not peaceful. The emotional torment I felt I can't even describe. Except maybe to call it hell. Nothing peaceful about it. 3 days later I woke up. On my birthday, which is also my sobriety date, March 9,2014.
Today I'm grateful to be alive and free from the pain of addiction. I never thought I would be happy, much less happy AND clean! I think if I can do it, anyone can. I hope this helps someone. Peace and love to everybody.

Some people say crush the stuff but apparently they put a new thing inside that puts you on immediate withdrawal if you do that now.
Should I wait longer? Take more? Crush it? 
Thanks :) also let me know your experience with it! 


EDIT:

Okay so after some research I did some different techniques.
The best option I found was to take the pellets out and soak them in water for a few minutes (I did 20). Then drink the water- BUT LEAVE THE PELLETS. The high wasn't a rush, just a warm feeling but I'd prefer that over opiate withdrawal sickness any day.

I also tried shooting up the water to see if I felt any immediate effects/rush, but I felt nothing. 

So stick to soaking the beads in water",1477085529.0

Slowly and without much notice that 2-3 became 4-5, then 2-3 per week, and now almost every day.

Every Monday I tell myself I'm going to stay clean this week, just take a week off to let myself recover... and I just can't. I feel stupid and vulnerable. Why the hell can't I go back to using the way i used to, when it didn't hurt me and it was great getting high. Now it feels like something I need to do and I can't stop.

Should I just flush the rest of what I have left since I know this is getting worse and I'm afraid of what might happen? I've been irritable and my productivity has dropped off the charts the last couple of months. At this rate I'll get fired and my life will fall apart in 1-2 months if I can't get a grip on this.

I thought that I could use opiates successfully again.

For the past several months, I would just use pills on the weekends.

That turned into using pills EVERY weekend.

That turned into pills and smoking some BTH all weekend long.

That turned into smoking some BTH once during the week and all weekend long.

That turned into smoking BTH a couple times a week and all weekend long.

Now I've been smoking BTH for at least the past two weeks, every day.

When I copped on Thursday, my dealer offered me some new works to take it to the next level. Been there, done that, I'm not going down THAT horrible road again.. God, I miss that fucking spike..

Friday was the last hit.

Here it is, Sunday morning and I feel like hell.

I've only slept about 2 hours all night and it's been in 30 minute increments. I'm hot. I'm freezing. I have wicked stomach cramps. I am going through fucking withdrawal.

So here I lay, in my own sweat, with my beautiful wife next to me, sound asleep.. She knows. She knows everything, and she still puts up with me and my escapes from reality.

To make matters even worse, we have a wedding to go to in less than 36 hours. Her best friend is getting married. I really hope I do feel  better by then. I can't imagine going to a wedding like this but I also can't imagine getting well for this wedding then having to be sick at work for the rest of the week.

How the fuck did I get myself into this? Oh yeah, I thought I could handle opiates once again..

BTW, I haven't been dopesick since I kicked my original dope habit back in 1999. It feels just as shitty but least now there's YouTube and Reddit. I watched about 8 documentaries last night..

Be careful out there people, shit sneaks up on you like a fucking ninja.

EDIT: Thanks so much for everyone's concerns. I contacted a friend of mine who's been in recovery for years. She's calling every hour to check on me. I also forgot to mention that I just harvested about 4 ounces of Sativa and about 6 ounces of Indica so I've been burning one whenever I feel the need, to to deal with the anxiety/insomnia.

Why and how do you do it?

Why do you do it knowing your chances of getting rolled on are insanely high compared to other substances?

How do you fucking deal with the customers that cannot function in normal society because they are just so far in the hole of addiction?

How do you do it knowing the chances of getting rolled on are high **and** knowing you'll likely do **years** in prison for this shit?

I get the money, the profits can be insane if done right. I've crunched numbers. I've had my cursor sitting over the ORDER button, just staring at it for over an hour one day. I just could never bring myself to it because dope dealers are a revolving door around here. You start dealing, get busted in 2-3 months, and out comes another dealer. The judge will throw these guys 3-5 years in prison on first offenses and then forget about them. Just another statistic in the book.

There are a ton of other substances to choose from. I mean, shit, Xanax has the same(If not worse) customer base type and you would get off so much easier getting caught dealing Xanax.

Smoke more and I feel a headache creeping up on me and then 5 minutes later I'm getting the chills and after a half hour im puking up what feels like everything I've ever had in my stomach ever.

 This happened 4 times until I just stopped going to this dude but it's been bugging the shit out of me. What the fuck couple make that happen. I have 0 allergies and have done all kinds of drugs and all different kinds of opiates and never had anything like this happen. And to top it off, absolutely nobody I have explained this to who has had the same shit has experienced anything like this. As a matter of fact they love the stuff.  

I've never posted here before but I'm a big time lurker and this has just been on my mind for some time now because I have 0 ideas why this has happened. It's fucked up and I don't understand.",1477181527.0

Get back into town Friday night, hit up my dboy for half a g for me and a g for a girl I help out occasionally. Get sorted, get back in my car, mix up a small shot, needle in, register, plunge, then all of a sudden it's 10:30, and I'm being woken up by a knock on my car door. Wtf! Fell out hard...then I'm trying to make it home, nodding bad. Get pulled over, give the cop a bull story of how I was working out of state all day, just getting home, and falling asleep at the wheel. Luckly, he let's me go, and I make it home safe. Big wake up though, I'm currently facing legal issues for a 3rd dui in a state that has very strict dui laws (worst thing about it is I wasn't even drinking, but had a small amount of thc in my system )

Anyway, time to stop. I've spent about 80% of my earnings over the past 4 years on opiates. Not to mention selling possesions, taking out a loan, getting cash advances on my cc. I'm sick of being sick. Currently 5 days clean, cold turkey. This week has sucked, but today has been better, and I have a big job tomorrow and several others this week which will keep me busy. Not to mention I have to serve some jail time on the 7th for the dui, and I do t want to be kicking in county.

So r/opiates, thanks for the memories and the nods, it's been fun, but I just can't keep it up. Sorry for the shit post

Tl;DR fell out, time to quit.

Not so Quick Update

Still doing well, job today went great. Been hanging at a friends tonight and another friend came to join us. Both these guys have a lot of RCS that won't be showing up on my drug test tomorrow, so I've been having a great night. DMT, DPT, a little bit of etizolam,3-mem-f, 4f-mph, won't be sleeping tonight because of the last 2, but that doesn't bother me since my DMT trips were so relaxing.

I don't know what you guys know about DPT (diproypltriptolyne[sp]) but my buddy explained it as the dark side to DMT. Apparently a trip can last 2-3 hours with a quick come up because it's snorted. Not super heavy visuals like blasting off, but some deeper mind and body shit. 

So my buddy says now that he's experienced DPT, every time he uses DMT, he can see that trap door that leads to the dark side. He told me about some pretty wild trips, pm me if you're interested to hear. Maybe if I get enough interest I'll pop over to r/DMT and share with them.

Anyway, I guess I smoked a bit to much DMT tonight, so the DPT didn't really take affect like I was hoping, oh well, there's always next time.

So, sorry for the long check up. Feeling great tonight,  early morning of my 7th day clean. (I'm sure the RCS are helping a bit too)

Love you guys, thanks for all your support. Here's to hoping PAWS stay away.

2nd TL;DR day 6 clean, great day working, great night, dabbling in rcs. UA tomorrow with no chance of dropping dirty. Feeling alive",1477174341.0

Bad idea,"We all stay at this cheap motel. Last night we were chilling in his friends room where he sells and neighbor says cops will be there soon bc him and his gf were breaking up and she was pelting him with eggs (lol). It reeked of bud in the room so dude hands me his lock bag and tells me to hide in my room. I'm happy with it since he always gives me a shot if I help him with random shit so I take it and go. Had to walk past cops are to my room. Poker face. When I got back he calls and tells me the lock combo bc cops are searching the room now so I can flush it if they come to my room. That's when the temptation hits.
                 I decide to open the bag out of curiosity and to take stock on what I'd be flushing since he keeps a lot of random paraphernalia in there. Also I was sick and getting a shot 1 way or the other. All I find of interest is coke which is weird bc he emphasized that I not dip into his shit and he knows I just do dope. I end up waiting for him to come give me some boy like he said he would and finally he hits me up at 3 am and comes by. He pulled out a rolled up bag in the bag I had with a few gs of fire ecp. He usually has it pointed out and I completely over looked it. He gives me enough for a good shot and I not only got well I got high like a rich person. This is when super temptation really kicks in.
                      He left the lock bag with me again. Much like a lobster I pinch.  Imo he shouldn't have left it with me as he knows I've been shooting dope for many years. I'm pretty certain he won't notice what I've taken but I know if he leaves it with me for a long time I will help myself to more. I definitely won't be sick with it here. He's mentioned leaving stuff with me bc his friend that normally holds it is moving. It would've worked fine if I didn't know combo. I know I'm wrong and bad but junkies gonna junk and he had np having me risk legal trouble holding his product. My trustworthiness was reinforced by me not getting into it while I was sick but I just didn't know it was there. Lol.

We use to run together but that stopped and we started going to different guys but stil hung out and chilled. So like 2 months ago he starts asking me for rides home from work. He gets off the same time as me but is 40 min away in traffic. Anyways I always cop after work and he knows that so he says let's go to his new guy cause it's fire and it's 160 a brick, which was basically what I was paying with my guy and the quality was about the same. Fast forward 2 months and almost everyday from Monday to Friday I am picking him up in the opposite direction coping then dropping him off in his town that is different from mine and is hot as hell. I find out from 2 different people I find out that the guy we have been seeing only charges 130-140 and this is from people that were introduced to the plug from my friend! Anyway I stop picking him up and start going to a different guy cause I'm pissed my friend is ripping me off when I travel over an extra hour to get him so he can cop also. I told
my friend I got a new connect whose only 130 so let's just go to him. My friend already new my new connect and the next time I see my new connect the connect tells me my good friend told him to charge me extra! (Which the new plug didn't do) I think he did this so I'd keep picking him up. I confronted my friend about him charging me more than he was actually paying and he shrugged it off as untrue and swears he is paying 160. I'm 99 percent sure he is lying especially cause he texted my new plug to tax me...
Anyway yesterday I told him I'd pick him up and wed go early this morning cause he was sick and has no car. He's been calling and texting nonstop and I've just been ignoring him. I mean I drove over an hour extra each day for 2 months to give ""my friend"" a ride home and so he could cop and he's charging me a middle fee and lying to me about it when I have plenty of my own connects and don't need him at all. In fact he needs me cause I have a car and he doesn't. Also we sometimes lend eachother 20-60$ as we get paid on diff days.. 80% of the time I'm lending to him but on Thursday he lent me 50$ because I told him I don't have any money and I'm not picking him up driving him to cop and getting nothing myself. He said he needed that 50$ back yesterday (I get paid on Friday) cause that's his last money. Anyway I ignored his calls Friday and then texted him late Friday night I'd pick him up tmro to go cop. Since then I haven't answered his 20 calls and texts. I think it's fair to do that to him considering how much gas and time I spent helping him out for him only to rip me off each time.

I've been smoking buds to try and relieve the stress but god damn I wanna use so bad. The other day I went to my friends house near where I used to cop and I was jittery as fuck. lol I was thinking about hopping on the train and going to see my guy. 

My BF is in long term treatment trying to get into a sober house and I don't want to use without him because I feel guilty. but I obviously wouldn't want him to know because this time around getting clean he actually is happy and wants to stay clean. This is the first time in almost 4 years that getting clean has actually worked for both of us. I don't wanna fuck it up :/ 

Ugh I just feel so guilty. He keeps saying how he wouldn't care if I used, to just tell him. But it would just kill me bc I was the one trying to preach sobriety to him and we both finally did it.

It(she) gave me insights into my life i wasn't expecting, and there is really an entity putting you in RS with the spirit world. Though i've seen spirits on Aya who didn't look very friendly. I've done shitloads of LSD, RC's, shrooms, Mescaline, but this was the only time i experienced a real dialogue with an entity. With Salvia it was close, i could feel the spirit of the plant, but the insights i got were from the journeys themselves, not with a dialogue. This just to say that although i have to believe i some things we can't see or measure because of my experiences, i'm still very skeptical about claims of the paranormal.(to me the bible, quran or torah are just badly written books teaching you're right and the others are not). I like Jesus though, the 1st hippie ever lol.

I'm thinking about drinking Aya either by myself, or go to Peru to the Takiwasi center for opiate addiction(if you've never heard of it, it's a medical-shamanic center where they detox you during the 1st 3 months, then give you Aya), or go to Peru and find a real shaman who would watch and teach me.

I'm on morphine substitution treatment, and i'm reading a book about a woman who became shaman, and she explains she was taught that when you drink Aya on a regular basis, it's as if you were building a house. You don't want to use shitty stuff so everything falls down after some time, that why you have to follow a diet one week before and after a ceremony. 

It puzzled me and now i'm wondering if going to Peru still while on maintenance treatment is such a good idea(other than the takiwasi center, but it's one year long(oh : they have 90%  of no relapsing after 5 years. And i seriously believe it given my one and only experience).

We have a talk and hash things out, Atleast I thought so. He ends up giving me my order for free that night, but not after waving a gun in my face and saying some things. 

All appeared to be well after our convo. The next day I purchase an eight ball from him. No issues. The next day I buy some more. No issues. Things were good throughout the weekend up until tonight. I text him, he calls and I miss the call. I call back to no response. So I go and hang out with my buddy who is bff with the older man. I'm the taxi man for my friend tonight because he has no license. I get my friend to get in contact with the older gentlemen and get my order placed. We end up at dudes house a while later, the dboy was on shrooms and my buddy barred the fuck out. I ask for a gram, that was previously set up to be purchased, the older man says he doesn't have anything. I'm super confused at this point. I look my his desk and scale and see a bag of which appears to be dope. I ask about it and he ""says that's nothing for you to worry about."" I say ""okay."" But begin stressing because I'm sick and haven't used all day and was banking on picking up. We leave his house and I'm driving my friend home and im bitching and complaining. My buddy says "" basically (the older gentlemen) just doesn't want to deal with you anymore."" Im like wtf?! What have I done to deserve that? Supposedly ppl have been talking shit about me or something and the older gentlemen thinks I stole a qp of shrooms from him a few weeks ago. Which I didn't. What blows my mind is how someone who prides himself about being OG and not listening to people's gossip and giving people the benefit of doubt and all that bull shit can't even be man enough to say any of this to my face or tell me he has issues with me. Not even 24 hours ago I was buying shit from him. What changed overnight ? It blows my mind that people can not want to take someone's money, but will allow them into their house? Why is a 65+ year old man acting like a middle school girl and having his friends do the dirty work for him? 

I'm so fucking done with shitty dboys in my town. I hope they all rot in hell and get caught up or somehting. It's just not fair. I don't do people dirty and im always legit and super great ful for the help and services the dboys provide. 

One more thing is I see the people that are still 'cool' and allowed to chill with the dboys and I think to myself ""wow, these legit junkies that are sketch AF are still on the good side of this guy and im not and I have no idea why""

Sorry for the shit post I just have been livid tonight and for the past few weeks because so much nonsense and bull shit has been going on. I'm just tired of being treated like shit when I legit care about my dboys, and they won't even take the money im begging for them to take. 

Maybe it's time to finally get clean. 
Idk. If anybody actually read that and has any insight or anything at all please feel free to say what's up. I could Deff use someone to talk to. I'm not doing so good.",1477303580.0

Not high yet, but not far from it, and until that I wrote a little song. Here is 
Back to Monday

I can never say enough of you i only hope
To be honest I never gonna leave you, so true
And the holding backs don't hold me back cos i never dreamed of here
To the otherside I never sent a messige unclear

I can only be a 2nd grader when i meet my mind
Cos the holes and the gaps don't let me think otherwise
I cannot say enough for your love
Even if i know, that's how i fuck my life up.

To the cages of my soul i take
To the question mark of my entire day

For the cold of the say goodbyes and only some times of my life
I can only hate the road that takes us apart
Julie I miss you so much It takes my will from me
Do you live your dream? Do you live your dream?

So I can't explain what I do, why I do
I say - I say what a fool what a fool
I can't explain why I'm happy for these times
I can't realize
I can't realize
I can't realize what i say is the truth or nor
But at least that's true, oh God",1477302887.0

He mainly torpedoed Perdue in their admittedly shitty campaign to prescribe everybody and their grandmother with OC 80s back in the 90s which most certainly didn't help the problem and literally asked out loud, ""...the question is what to do about it now?"", but offered zero solutions. 

Directly after that quote he muttered something about supporting treatment for addicts and then talked to some firefighters about Naloxone, but left much of the substance and nuance of this (our) problem at the writer's room door.

He said nothing of the new rash of fentanyl overdose deaths, lightly touched but mainly brushed aside the concerns that the cheapness of heroin and lack of current prescribing of prescription drugs is pushing people to the streets, and did not even mention the problem of the mass incarceration of addicts instead of funneling them into treatment related avenues.

His program has been incredibly hard-hitting and in-depth time and time again, but litigating the past (Purdue) and offering up no real solutions is disappointing.

I really wish a show of Last Week Tonight's caliber would give the problem we face the exposure and attention to detail it deserves, because shows like this do help sway public opinion and can translate into the support for treatment and away from incarceration that I think would actually help the problem, and not make it way fucking worse.

I met him a few years earlier through our mutual friend Jake. Jake was the outgoing, adventurous one of my friends, very into drugs like myself. We tried them all together, LSD, wormwood extract we made ourselves, chloroform. Soma, Dexedrine, meth xanax and oxy. Yeah oxy, we got stuck on that last one.

We planned a camping trip because Casey was going away to college. One last trip into the wilderness. We were starting at Jake's dads because he lived near the river we were going to canoe down.

I think I was 20 years old then. Jake had to buy the wine. Casey supplied the oxy. I brought the acid. Casey always supplied the oxy and I the acid. 

We showed up a short while before dusk and we all popped a few footballs. We were partying that night before we headed out. We set up a tent at Jakes dads place, and started building a fire. We were excited. We really didn't have a plan - canoe down the river, into the main river. Camp along the way. Canoe into the reservoir, and have fun til we get bored. Then, hitch hike home. Drive back, pick up our shit.  Simple. This was before cell phones were popular, not that they'd have helped where we were headed.

The fire got going, the tent was set. For our last night in civilization we decided to go hard. The jugs of Carlo Rossi were cracked, and we used them to wash down the footballs. A few rails of oxy later, and we were happy. Sitting by the fire, bullshitting, drinking. Talking about Casey running off to the city, how we hoped he wouldn't change.

We busted out the ribeyes and potato salad. We cooked and ate like cavemen, holding our steaks over the fire impaled on sticks. Before long we were all a mess, grease, wine and meat juices running down our chins, staining our shirts. The xanax took over and we ate, and ate. Hot dogs for the trip, sandwiches. Jerky. Everything.

We kept sneaking into the tent to do more lines, and before long it had seemed like we went through 20 footballs. But we were having fun, joking and laughing with each other. Talking about what fun wed have on this trip. How it was probably the last time us three would be together, at least like this.

Casey went into town on his scooter, to steal some cheese and hot dogs. That crazy xanax! We needed more anyway. The wine was running low, and the firewood. It was getting late.

Casey made it back, but the xanax munchies wouldn't abate. We were fully drunk now. Casey ate a whole block of cheddar, one bite at a time. We finished our wine and ate the hotdogs too. 

Finally, a good night line of oxy and we crawled in our sleeping bags. There was no excited talk of the days to come, no restless chatter. We were out.

Jake woke me up. 

""Krew! Krew! Wake up! Casey's dead!""

I opened my eyes and sat up. Casey was right next to me. For some reason, I was relieved. I felt he couldnt be dead, he's right here.

I shook Casey by his shoulder, but he was... Cold, and oddly stiff. Shit. This can't be real.

I jump up and Jakes on his way inside to call an ambulance. I was in shock. He was right there with us the whole time. How could he die?

The EMTs arrive, and after a few tests and injections, he's still dead. They take him away.

It took a long time to understand we aren't invincible, that he died because we were careless. We knew that, technically what we were doing was dangerous. We thought it was a hazard for other people to worry about. We were experienced with drugs. But somehow that didn't translate to safe. 

Casey never made it to college. I moved to the same city he was headed that fall. I don't understand why he died and not me, or Jake. Thats how life goes sometimes.

Ten years later Jake lost his life. Now its just me. Many days I think back to that night. Our happiness, our optimism. Our recklessness. Ten years later, it turns out we have a 1 in 3 survival rate. I've come close to making that an even 0. 

I haven't done anything special to live this long. We were 3 intelligent and normally responsible people. We researched everything we did, we were cautious most of the time. I don't know what makes me different. But I know what made us different. We thought we knew exactly what we were doing. I guess in some ways we did. But, in others, we had no idea.

If bodily functions including but not limited to poop disgust you in any capacity, do not continue with this shitty tale. 

How do you know you're addicted to opiates? Was it when you awoke one morning glistening with sweat, suffering from just enough anxiety to indicate that something is off. Or perhaps when your hot ass girlfriend has her soft lips wrapped around your penis, yet you knew you were nowhere near climax, just that numb feeling. My story isn’t so glamourous. Let me tell you about the day I realized I had a problem on my hands...

It's 10:30 a.m and I've just opened my eyes. My girlfriend Noel is snoozing away topless next to me, and all feels right with the world. However I can remember this morning so vividly,  because if you're ever forced to violate your own anus for any period of time, the experience sticks like hot cum on a kleenex. I notice I have a bit of a stomach ache, which I initially brush off and attribute to needing dope. I roll over and rummage around looking for my bundles, oblivious to the events that are about to unfold.

I quietly sit up, flick the bag so the contents settle to the bottom, and pour myself a nice line onto the glass of my iPhone. I toss the rolled up 20 into a bowl next to my bed, and collapse back onto my pillows. I scroll though various mind numbing buzzfeed articles, anxiously awaiting the pain relief that would soon be washing over me. When the stabbing, burning feeling intensified, I begrudgingly poured another bag out and quickly inhaled. 
“What the fuck” I thought 
“I don’t have time for this shit today, I have to work” I knew the second bag should eradicate my pain, or at the very least get me high enough not to care.  

At around 11:15 it starts to hit me that this isn’t run of the mill achy withdrawal pain, somethings up. I have zero desire to get out from underneath my down comforter, but alas, the toilet is not located in my bed, and I slide out from underneath the luxury suede. I waddle into the bathroom with one eye half open, one sock on, and place my ass onto the porcelain. I press my palm to my forehead and feel that I’m pretty warm, but ultimately don’t think much of it. 

At 11:18 my stomach starts to seriously spasm and I’m bent in half. I’m pushing , but nothing seems to be making any headway. I’m in a good deal of pain at this point, so I rationalize giving myself another couple of bags. I attempt to stand up, and this is where shit REALLY hits the fan (still deciding on whether or not I want that pun to be intended). My ass barely unsticks from the toilet when I feel a sharp, acute pain in my asshole. WHAT THE FUCK! Did I tear something? But no poop came out? I immediately sit back down and try to internally discern the next best course of action. 

“Noel!!” I scream to my girlfriend. “My asshole hurts!!”. Whether or not this would cause alarm for people in a normal relationship is debatable, but Noel was entirely used to me calling bluffs on things like this. It’s just within the spectrum of weird shit I would say out of the blue to elicit a smile on her face. So needless to say, she didn’t initially take me seriously or respond right away, and in turn I decided to wait a few more minutes before pursuing her assistance any further. 

Knowing I couldn't stand up without serious pain, I took this alone time to figure a way to assess the situation. Lacking a handheld mirror within my reach, I used the next best thing. I activated the front camera, took a deep breath, and slid it underneath my asshole to record video evidence of whatever was transpiring down there. The results did not disappoint.

What I saw looking back at me from that camera still haunts me to this day. The redness, the size, it's enough to make you feel sympathy for a swollen asshole. I wish I could tell you I still had the photo, but in reality, even people as depraved as I would not wish to claim ownership to such a thing. It was dilated about 6 inches, and there was a massive, huge brown circular chunk of shit forcing my rectum into an ungodly wide circumference. I had never seen anything like it, nor did I think I was capable of such a thing.

“Oh my fucking god… what the fuck” I was panicking inside. This was only the tip of the iceberg, the thing got WIDER as it got deeper. How do I know? Because I started pressing around it, hoping to maybe squish it down enough to fit through so I could go back to bed. I didn’t even make a dent, as this particular nugget was hard as a rock. Drops of blood fell softly onto my hand, and this is when I started to cry.

“NOEL!!! PLEASE COME HELP ME!!!”  I was determined to wake her up. It was time to get some supplies and tackle this fucking demon.

She sauntered in, visibly annoyed and extremely displeased by the matter.

“I need you to not laugh” I said sullenly.

“What the fuck Hamma? What the fuck did you need to wake me up and tell me about your butthole for? I don’t care”

“You need to take a look at this”

I handed her the phone, lips quivering and my eyes full of tears. She needed to know this was not a drill, my butthole had declared war. 

“Omg, is that you? Is that your shit?” her eyes widened and a small smile began to curl on her lips, replaced with a look of concern as I screamed, another stomach spasm causing my bowels to involuntarily push, forcing this turd out ever so slightly and inducing the feeling of being slowly ass raped by a horse.

“It’s me..please..please this hurts so bad. I need you to do me a few favors and please be quick about it”

She looked on lovingly, though the situation was hilarious in hindsight, she knew I was in genuine pain and wanted to help. 

“I need 2 bags and a straw, this is going to take a while and it’s going to hurt. I need you to go to the liquor store and get me the 20$ bottle of jack. Before you leave, I need you to bring me some olive oil in a cup and a pair of latex gloves from under the sink”

Being a nurse for 7 years, particularly geriatrics, I have dealt with impacted patients before. I have dealt with patients who hadn’t shit for so long that they literally vomited shit, and I knew the steps that have to be taken. We were way past any enemas or oral laxatives. I was going to have to manually break this shit down if I had any chance of survival. 

When she shut the door, I began to work. I dipped my hands over and over into the olive oil, each time breaking a molecule of shit off the shit monster. It was sort of like facing the giant  boss at the end of a video game, your attacks do negligible damage, and you have an uphill battle on your hands.

I squished, I pushed, I drank and I inhaled. 45 minutes into the ordeal, I was drunk, high, and brave. The cup next to me had more shit particles than olive oil, but the battle was nearing a close. Each time she came to check on me, she would rub my back with cold water and hug me tightly. I knew she was disgusted, but she didn’t show it one bit, what a keeper. She even offered to clean and refill my olive oil cup, which I triumphantly informed her wouldn’t be necessary. The spasms were coming few and farther between, which was a relief. She was rubbing my head when I suddenly felt the spasm to end them all.

I screamed, and I could feel the beads of sweat emerging from my pores instantly as my pain exponentially increased. My stomach felt like it was being internally folded in half, and the breath escaped my lungs. All of a sudden, the rest of the shit violently erupted from me like a homing missile. 3 seconds and a tsunami wave of splash water later, I felt empty, and intensely sore. We looked at each other and held our gaze for a few seconds before confirming.

“Is it..did it all come out? Is it over?”

“It’s over babe.”

She assisted me back to the bed, and got me some ice to soothe my loose and throbbing asshole. I have since made a full recovery, let this be a reminder.

From my experience, most people who have gotten the vivitrol shot are either forced to by their family, or they immediately regret the decision and want to get high ASAP. This is a guide for those who hate this damn shot lol.

Now we all know that from Days 1-14 there is absolutely no way of getting high on this shot. You just have to tought it out for those 2 weeks. I did try doing Suboxone at Day 8 and Day 14, felt high for about 30 seconds and then it disappeared. I don't even think fentanyl will get you high, for reasons I am about to explain later.

But starting on Day 16 I was able to feel the effects of sublingual **SUBOXONE**. Suboxone is the secret weapon to beat the vivitrol shot. I had to take a total of 8 mg sublingual, taking 2 mg at a time. There is no euphoria, but you will experience physical relief from the vivitrol hell starting on Day 16. It was the first time I felt relaxed in the 16 days since the shot.

Then from Days 16-21 you will slowly but surely get a little bit more high on Suboxone as each day passes. As I said, this will be a high with no euphoria. What I experienced from Days 16-21 was body relaxation, depressed breathing, and that feeling of wanting to crawl out of my skin had completely disappeared. 

Why I say fentanyl probably won't work during Days 1-14 is because I chewed up a very large dose of a fentanyl patch on Day 20. I felt absolutely NO EFFECTS from doing so. And upon further research, I have found that Suboxone actually has a higher binding affinity to the opiate receptor than does fentanyl. Now, I'm sure things like Remifentanil and Sufentanil will break through this shot. But those are very hard to find lol. 

Anyway, starting at Day 21-22, you are able to get *SLIGHT* euphoria from Suboxone. It's probably about 25% of the euphoria you'd normally get from dosing suboxone without a tolerance.

By Day 25 I was able to get 80% of the high from Suboxone. But still not much euphoria though. 

Tried smoking black tar heroin at Day 26, got absolutely NO EFFECTS from doing so. So in conclusion ladies and gentleman, from my experience the ONLY way of breaking through this shot is with Suboxone. It still doesn't do a whole lot, but subs will definitely will give you some relief. ",1477244919.0

Have about 30 Roxi 15mgs, 80 Xanax 2mgs,15 Gabapentin 300mg, and 50mg of Clonazolam. So I'm not really at a shortage, however I do suffer from several issues causing pain and anxiety to begin with. This all started after having a severe gallbladder attack because I have hepatitis C and my liver is super sensitive also the coming cold weather has made the four rods in my femur and plates holding my ligaments In place really sensitive as well, all after a really bad accident I had skateboardIng. Any recommendations on how to decrease my opiate intake comfortably? Any and all inputs are appreciated.",1477366025.0

598m96,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/598m96/vote_dope_on_done/,13,https://redd.it/598m96,KindStreak,Vote: Dope on 'Done,"After years of relapse and failed treatmens, including suboxone on 3 separate occasions, I reluctantly agreed to MMT.  Roughly 2 weeks ago I went through a comprehensive intake that included a panel of bloodwork and a complete physical examination. The first dose of my induction was 30mg after which my daily dose went up in 5mg increments every other day.  I am currently frozen at 60mg until I see my clinician hopefully Wednesday - I began pleading with the nurses to see him a week ago - remaining @ 60mg is counterproductive because I still have insane cravings amd drug seeking behaviors.

Now for the first 7 days or so I could still feel dope, in fact, I needed a little shot in the evenings to stave off the beginning signs of withdrawal. The rush was diminished, but undoubtedly present. However, once I hit 50mg or so the dope seemed to lose its luster if you will. At first I thought I got a heavily stepped on bag, then I thought I got completely beat, but.....last night I was driving my dealer to make his evening plays and at the end of the night he reached into his big ziploc and pulled a 40 bag out at random to give me for payment. (He has wheels, but no license).  After banging the whole .4 of what I knew was pretty good ECP and barely getting a rush or high I finally concluded it was the 'done. I must say that I do tend to still get a baby rush if I do a monster shot in the morning before I go to the clinic, but it just seems like a waste of money st this point.  I've scoured the usual online communities - reddit, bluelight, drugs-forum, erowid etc - and there seems to be about a 50/50 split on this, for those on 60mg of methadone or above, about half claim their 'done intensifies their dope, while the other half, like me, claim their 'done seriously impedes or blunts both the rush and the euphoria that should accompany a shot of good heroin. I guess for people like myself 60mg daily saturates receptors to the point where dope is useless.  So I am putting it to a vote here, for those on 60mg+ 'done , does heroin still get you high or not?

Some people asked for me to update on how I was feeling after....,"So I got the shot last Wednesday. Got it 5 days after using, yes 5. No I'm not lying. I know everyone and everything says 7-10 days minimum, but I did 5 and felt no I'll effects. If you want more info on how I pulled that off, just ask.

Overall though, I feel pretty good. Idk if its a symptom of the shot or unrelated, but I've been getting light headed much more often than before when standing up quickly (never ever happened before, almost every time now if I'm going from the ground to standing straight up). Also, I haven't been able to get a great nights sleep yet; again, not sure if a side effect or unrelated, but I'll wait it out a bit and if either of both still linger, ask my Dr about it next time I see him. 

Physically, other than the above, I've felt fine for the last 5/6 days. Did some manual labor on Thursday (the day after my shot) and other than the light headedness, I felt great during and after. I still think about dope, and I've even helped people cop, and I've even done it the day after getting my shot (stupid, I know, but it was free so why not try). When helping ppl cop I'm not trying to pinch an extra bag here or there, bc I know it won't make a difference. I've debated a few times getting like a bun and just holding on to it, hiding it and hopefully forgetting about it, so that IF I rember it after im done with Vivitrol I have it if desired. However, after realizing what a stupid plan that is bc I'm basically telling myself im going to use once I'm off the shot if I were to do that, I decided against it. I'm sure dude will still be around if I have the desire to use after who knows how long on the shot. So that's where I'm at mentally. I've had a couple drinks on two or three occasions since the shot, just socially, not trying to get drunk or anything, and felt no ill effect from that.

I'd say the mental struggle is the worst part right now, but I've only been clean for 10 days now (woo hoo!! Longest in like 4 years probably). Well, I guess not technically clean since I tried a couple bags the day after the shot, but I literally felt nothing. I should say I haven't gotten high on opiates In 10 days, so give me some credit there. But im hoping as time goes on, the mental aspect will diminish. We'll see how that goes though. I have taken some ambien and Valium a couple nights to help w the sleep and I smoke weed still, but I have to stop that after this weekend to get ready for a possible probation drug test.

I scored some hydro (Watson 853's, pale yellow), and took about 3 over the course of the night. I'm pretty sure they were 10 mg each.

Amazing high, but I know I can't afford to go any deeper than this. I'm tempted to do it again tonight, but this time with a CWE, so as not to kill my liver.

I'm broke right now, and have no idea how to score anything else in my area, so if I got rid of these, I'd have a tough time finding an alternative, thankfully.

I know this is a slippery slope I'm on, and I want to have control as much as I can, so as not to fall down the rabbit hole of addiction. Any thoughts/advice?

My last 0.5mg of suboxone was now over 4 days ago. Obviously experiencing a bit of PAWS, but that was WAY easier than cold turkeying a 6 month heavy fentanyl habit.

Anyway, would recommend. I never really felt ""high"" on suboxone (I know others here disagree though) and I guess it was a short enough taper that my brain never really got hooked on the subs. I know people say you can't taper opiates (I couldn't taper fentanyl for shit), but for some reason I didn't have any issue with the subs. My impression is less is more with suboxone and that it is helpful--just don't understand the doctors who are scripting 16+mg of that shit a day, seems ridiculous.

Just thought I'd report my experience. Emotional as fuck right now, the real world is in high definition, but it feels so good just not to be dependent.

So I've heard plenty of people say things like ""chipping never works, you'll just end up addicted"" or ""My bf and I've been chipping for a year, it's fine,"" and I thought it would be nice to get some data behind chipping patterns and outcomes.

So I made a survey! **[HERE IT IS](https://goo.gl/forms/QYbr6Mf1MXEawjPm1)**

I timed myself taking it, and it takes less than 5 minutes.

This is my first time doing something like this, so I'm very open to suggestions on how to do things better! Suggestions for additional questions are especially welcome. 

Right now my plan is to wait a few weeks to collect data, then make some pretty charts and graphs and post a little report in this subreddit. If it's interesting enough, it might even be cool to make the dataset public (although I am very aware of privacy concerns - I tried very hard to minimize personally identifying information in the questions, but you tell me whether the answers are anonymous enough).

I don't really visit other drugs forums, but if you do and think they would benefit from this, please feel free to post the survey link. I'll be grateful for the larger sample size

A good friend of mine and her sister from Uruguay were going to my Cali high school.

Her dad had a baggie of white Vicodins (a lot.. thinking about it now I wonder if she put them in a bag or what) and she asked me if I could keep them in my room for awhile.

By this age I had already tried weed a few times, drank and unfortunately done dust off (FUCK ME), so the opportunity to keep some drugs in my room was a very cool one. My parents never suspected I would do drugs, as my grades were pristine and I enjoyed a lot of freedom and privacy in my room so I wasn't worried about holding. 

This is my first memory: It was an early morning; probably 7:55a. I was walking through the basketball courts of my high school and approaching my first class. The sun was just peaking through the clouds and there was a refreshing, cool wafting of new day air hitting my young face. I had brought a few of the pills, opened my backpack up, and chewed one up. 15 minutes later, I experienced the happiest, most euphoric experience of my life (sad isn't it?) which kept intensifying. 

I loved class on this Vicodin. I loved my classmates. I was in heaven. There was no where else I'd rather be.

And that, opiate family is the high I chased for the next 10 years and when I fell in love with opiate pain killers. 

I ate the entire bag. She never asked for it back or mentioned it again.

My dear sweet niece just passed from a heroin od. Those who were with her said she was injected in the neck. What happened next apparently was that she started screaming, bit through her bottom lip and went into a prayer position, then she passed. I dont know the people that were with her, its all just second hand to us at this point. She lived in a different state and all this info is coming from her husband. They were seperated and he hadnt seen her for a few days, then was contacted saying they (police) had found her. He also made a comment that when he heard what happened he wanted to rush in to help her but instead did the right thing and called police. But if the police were the ones that told him in the first place why would he need to do that?

Does this sound like a heroin od? I dont have much knowledge but for some reason this doesnt sound like heroin? We arent being given much information from law enforcement, her body hasnt even been released to her parents yet. 

When I first heard what happened I pictured her falling asleep and not waking up, not the violent scene that is being told.

Sorry if this is dis-jointed or rambling. I'm just sort of in a state of shock and wonder if theres more that isnt being told.

I remember when Oxy Contin was released by the company. Back then, any doctor prescribing it had to get a special DEA control number in order to prescribe it to a patient. I guess that went out the window very shortly after its release.

I also remember a section of the medical library on campus had a display of,all the drugs that Purdue made, including Oxy Contin.  I remember there being little signs under the displays of pills that said ""These are placebos"" so that someone wouldn't try to break the glass to score a shitload of pills.

I worked there during my summers in high school and for close to a year after graduating, in their computer lab and also in their customer service department, helping doctors and wholesalers with their orders. My mom worked their for 25 years before moving to a different part of the country.

I just think it's fucking insane that I used to work for the company that helped create this insane epidemic in this country. I am so glad I worked there back then and not now. What a shit show it must be there right now.

Crazy/true story: My dad was a junkie in NYC back in the 80s. One of the guys I befriended at Purdue used to be a junkie as well and it turns out he used to buy drugs from my dad back in the day. When I went through my heroin phase back in the mid 90s, the guy I befriended at Purdue was the only guy who actually helped me get clean. He let me stay at his apartment in New York when I was kicking. He would take me to meetings, he would do anything he possibly could to help me get clean. He actually helped me get on the methadone program. We are still good friends 20 years later and talk regularly. He's one of my fucking idols.

Just thought I'd share a little of my backstory..

As far as questions regarding working for Purdue, I was very young at the time. I wasn't even 20 years old yet and I was working at a pharmaceutical company. I totally got the job through my mom and didn't have much responsibility because of my age/experience. Also, keep in mind that this was 20 years ago. My memory is a bit foggy considering it was such a long time ago.

I thought some of you might find that interesting or intriguing. Have a great day!

I honestly feel like such a melodramatic fool posting here, when I hear of people with actual physical addiction, but I feel like it's the only place where people might be able to help; I've lurked for a while and I haven't seen a friendlier, more helpful drug-related online community than this one (And other reddit drug subreddits, as a matter of fact). 

So I've used heroin three times. All three uses were in the space of a week, and occurred around 3-4 months ago. I've been going through depression for two years and used opiates before then, but nothing stronger than Dihydrocodeine. The fact I even got my hands on H was a mistake; I ordered Valium on a DNM, they sent a small amount of brown instead, and I intended to flush it; but my curiosity got the better of me, and I took a small line that night. 'Just once' I told myself, but once again my desire got the best of me, and I ended up using it all within a week (I spent 3 nights high that week; like I say, I'm very opiate-naive). 

Now, obviously I didn't build up a physical addiction from that. I haven't used any opiates since; not even Codeine (Not out of fear of addiction, just because I know the codeine will feel painfully mediocre compared to H). But I thought about it, every single day, I thought about buying another point or two from that same DNM; I spent hours comparing prices, ect, and when the depression got really bad, I came dangerously close to falling back into the trap. 

I finally grew free of these urges only two or three weeks ago. My life has improved greatly since I first tried heroin; I have a girlfriend who I honestly adore so much it hurts, some amazing new friends (Including a best friend who's like a brother to me), I'm back in education (University), and my mental health's been better than it has in years thanks to some new 5-htp supplements I'm taking. I honestly thought I was free from the urges, that maybe the only reason I wanted to do heroin again so much was out of depression. 

But then a week ago, they came back, stronger than ever. I'm still happy. I'm happy with my current life situation, and I know I could lose it all if I give into these urges, but I still can't tell myself I'll never do heroin again. The way it made me feel is so fucking unforgettable, it's stuck with me and nothing seems to cure me of this desire. 

So I guess what I'm asking is does it ever get better? Do the cravings lessen in time, or will I have to deal with this internal struggle for the rest of my life? 

EDIT: Thanks for the support, guys. I actually did end up ordering more H on a DNM, then I saw a pic of me and my girl together, and read these posts and felt awful, luckily was able to cancel the order and spend that BTC on some nice 2cb and bud instead :)",1477481949.0

I have the potential to get it all back and then some if I just STOP FUCKING AROUND! At first I would tell myself I was too scared of the WD's (never went through it) and would wait until ""the time was right"" and the stress of my financial situation got better for me to set aside a weekend, take the plunge and check myself into an outpatient . You see, I ran into a problem with my business over the course of the last 4 months. I purchased some building materials and they were just not good. I returned them to the store and got some new ones back ... no good... return again... no good. I've been in my line of work forever and the hardware supplier is someone I trust but that whole back and forth fiasco lost me quite a few jobs and contracts. I had a decent sized nest egg of savings set aside and I was sure I would find a new Hardware guy or my guy would get his shit together before taking too big a hit to my savings... Not the case.

After quite some time of me going back and forth with my guy I finally linked up with the ""right guy"" aaaaaaand ... NO FUCKING GOOD. That was another 2 month fiasco and this time my back was to the wall for real. My nest egg was completely gone. I asked my wife to take a loan from her credit union. Credit cards. Burnt some dude who I know supplied my original hardware guy for a nice chunk of change. My debt at this point is now bigger than what my nest egg was.... oh how the mighty have fallen.

Point is, the other day some new building material arrived, people aren't crazy about it and nobody is beating down my door for my services. I can certainly get back to work with it at a slow and steady pace if I tighten up but the 5,000 lb gorilla or $300 a day habit I've built up will eat all that money up if i don't stop... NOW!

or.....

Switch to the other thing... the dark side. You see, I have access to that other thing. More access to it than most, large quantities and for diiiiiiirt cheap. I can probably go from spending $300 a day to about $60 a day which would literally equate to like a rounding error for me. If I buy my lunch for the week and cook dinner it would literally cost me $0 to stay high all the time... Or I can man the fuck up when I wake up tomorrow morning with nothing (first time in forever) wait till I get to the 18-20 hour mark and pop a sub and start to get my life back in order. 

I'm telling myself that if I just use it for now I can stack up a bit and go back to my DOC (the more socially acceptable of the two) and as long as I have money off to the side there are all types of opportunities that come my way that require investments but I can offset my huge habit with these quick investments to where even that huge habit gets knocked down quite a bit. but who am I kidding. I was never able to control myself when it came to things like that... I'm in a pickle here boys.

I'm talking about actually really making your own with some decent skill, maybe even trying to print on some kind of cotton blend paper (which I have no idea where you would get that from or how to make it. I know the real cotton paper money is printed on is like impossible to get, but I'm sure there's some kind of cotton paper stuff out there that might feel like money but wouldn't pass further scrutiny). I guess you could possibly print on cardboard paper or something like that and it would feel like money kinda.

Anyway, If you're getting shit from a dboy and have no intentions of ever going back to him (maybe he always shorts you, or maybe you're moving. Who knows?) would you consider giving him phony money, or have you ever done it before? If so, how did it go down and did he ever come back at you? I would never do this like Bubbles did, only if I was in my car and able to get away from said dboy if he would notice the fake money (probably why you should do it with some money that feels real at least. It doesn't have to look perfect, especially if you're doing the deal at night). 

Oh yeah, there's always been a lot of counterfeit money on the darknet for sale for like 10-50c on the dollar which is supposed to be decent enough to fool people at normal stores.  I wouldn't want to get caught using this at bars/stores/whatever, but giving it to a dealer is much less risky. Since you're giving the money to someone who probably has a lot of cash, there's very little chance that he'll ever figure out who the hell gave him the funny money.  Not to mention, even if he did figure it out it's not like he's going to go to the cops about it. I know that's not much of a reason to do it, since the guy could come beat your ass or maybe even kill you if he's that much of a psycho (so far i've only had one dope boy who was actually a fucking crazy person. That guy fucking sucked). However I cite my previous statement saying he'd probably never figure out it was you the fake money came from.

I don't post much here, I typically surf reddit, especially r/Opiates and r/OurOverUsedVeins, as a way to vent my own issues and dependencies by relating to all of you perfect people. Your community is just so nice, and understanding; how remarkable it would be to have the mentality here freely diffuse outward and influence the disposition of he majority. 

As for the reason of my post. My buddy, Renton, has been involved in the substance abuse of smack for 2 year. He never allowed enough time to pass to manifest complacency before getting off. Usual 3 months or so hooked, then he'd settle into his cave in solidarity, for a few days, until he'd emerge a strong and proud guy. Well, in December or January he faultered, like we all do. He enjoyed the hell out of it for awhile, ad you could guys, lol. But in may maintaining his habit became more effort than it was worth, but he pushed through biting every bullet projected with apathy because that fix was coming. It might have been 4 am, and Renton was irritated with the 6 people in his car, some of which go baby mode from the slightest obstacle that may have erected to slow down their goal. We all put in the effort Renton put it, no doubt. 
But on Friday, Renton attempted to continue his torture, but when he was told it couldn't happen, instead of dealing with the horse shit involved with scoring in the Texas Panhandle, he decided no more. 

Today is Tuesday, day 5 of detox off 19 months of tomfoolery. I'm watching the cartoon I walkways watch, but I'm actually watching them this time. I'm laughing. I may not be able to get up from a seated position without being reminded of 3 decades of my imaginary coal mining labor. But besides my lumbar, I am sitting alone in my place, truly happy. When Renton was amidst his baggage, when he imagined the magnitude of happiness would be great. But now that it has actually arrived, my imagination lacked some imagination. This was Renton's 5th time getting clean on his own, but never had he had allowed his body to adapt and become acclimated to a period this long. But fortunately it wasn't impossible. 

Now, I don't want to boast about personal achievements. Everything I've typed is not an achievement. But to us, what else could we ask for if we let our hearts decide. From the new position, Renton can hold that $20 in his hand and make that call and attain some great marijuana to provide those real laughs and experiences. Because I miss those laughs. The laughs caused by the highest magnitude of digression possible, instead of a laugh caused by a semi-witty quip with respect to the guy who's 2 hours late.. 
And I'm not advocating everyone to detox. Just.. Anyone who reads this, remember all that shit. Driving down some backroad boxhotting a car, being able to pursue interests independently. But of, course, plenty of these are posted a day, I don't want to come off as pompous. Just a 21 year old kid, dropped out of college 3 times so far, still just trying to figure out how to continue along in a way that promotes joy, for myself, and that fills that hole that we're all trying to fill. I hope a book may help. Or chain smoking. Lol. You know, whatever.

The worst was a girl I know who was doing the nod and stand ballet and bumping into shit and hurting herself but would chew us out for waking her/snapping her out of it to insist she sit on the bed (with loads of pillows so she could relax and still be sitting up mostly) or to get her to sit in the comfortable recliner. A lot of times they even get pissed at us for trying to get them sitting somewhere comfortable to nod. I've nodded out in many a terribly uncomfortable position and listened to gf who would have me reposition.

What pet peeves about this life do you have or what do other users do that annoys you?

Licking injection site after a shot makes me cringe 100% of the time.

Using pocket lint for filter.

Gatorade instead of water.

Random newer users convinced what they get from their dude is ""pure"".

Ppl who are basically opiate naive insisting they used to have such a huge tolerance bc they ""totally drank so much lean back in the day"".

Ppl smoking/snorting stuff w APAP. (Caught my cuz and her bf smoking a 5mg perc 1 time. Tried to convince them this was bad and they should feel bad but they weren't hearing it).

Currently on a clinical trial that isn't really helping...

Painkillers allow me to at least semi-function and enjoy life a little. I have pain every day.

I started seeing my family doctor about 5 months ago...you guys know the drill, we started with anti-depressants, then tramadol, then codine, then hydrocodone, then to percocet 5mg 120/m, then percocet 7.5mg 120/m. I was on percocet 7.5mg for 3-4 months, and it worked great, I was able to more every day and felt better and more energetic and the pain was much better.

However last month he told me to try taking 1/2 a pill instead of a whole pill. I told him it didn't work near as well and I wasn't able to do it. Well this month he reduced it to 5mg so it would be a little more than half of 7.5mg.

It sounds like hes weaning me off and I'm afraid of losing the life saving prescription that was so hard to get in the first place.
It's week 3 of the 5 mg and it's just not working near as well, although I'm afraid to call or complain because everything looks like drug seeking behavior, and I just don't know what to do.

In my first visits with him I asked for a referral to a pain management doctor, he told me we didn't need to do that yet.

Any ideas on how to proceed?  I really can't lose this prescription...Thanks for taking the time to read.

If I have a buddy with me that i trust, I usually let them hit my neck vein. whenever I do dope or coke, assuming I have clean rigs, I *always* prep for IV. But after many an hour or 2 spent poking and repoking and registering and reregistering just for it to slip out anyway, I invariably get frustrated and jam it Im my shoulder. Ive posted stuff like this before and I know some of you are tthinking ""this inexperienced dumbass just doesn't know how to find a vein, *I* could hit his veins"" I assure you this is not the case. Unless I trust you enough to hit my neck vein or my fem, there is no way youre gonna get my veins. So I IM when my veins wont come out to play. 

For a long period when I used to live in Seattle, my veins were so far gone and my addiction was so strong that I even just started going straight for the IM because I knew trying to hit a vein would just be a frustrating dissapointmet. You dont get a rush, but it will get you well. I feel like it keeps you well longer as well. For a period of 6-8 months I just went straight for IM. Im talking grams and grams and grams of tar shooting straight into my shoulders and (Im knocking on wood as I write this) ive NEVER had an abscess. This is shocking even to me. Most of the time I had access to clean equipment through Seattle's lovely needle exchange program but not always. Some times after IMing ill get a sore lump in my shoulder for a couple days but they always go away. I know the tell-tale-scared the fuck up-shoulders are the calling card of the IMer. I used to see older junkies and their shoulders and still IM because I was that strung out. I gave fuck none what my shoulders would look like in 10 years. 

So here I am, my veins are slowly slowly making a comeback. Im just wondering how many of you/us do that? How have I never had an abscess? I used to fill those 3ml w the 3"" needle up w that cheap nasty tar that Seattle was flooded w back in the day. I used to do 1.5g shots of that shit straight to the muscle. How do I not have scars from that shit?

Also I've heard that when you IM its ""better for you"" if the shot has blood mixed in, as if I've already registered and it slipped out. Is that true? For some reason I always assumed the opposite just because it looks so nasty. Especially with tar. 

Im kinda cleaned up these days thank fuck. Shit grosses me out thinking about it now. Using partially coagulated blood mixed with filthy cheap shitty Seattle heroin and just  it into my skin because my veins were already wrecked from doing the same thing too many times. Yikes

I don't have a tolerance to promethazine though unless it has a cross tolerance with hydroxyzine (I have a prescription and take 20-30mg everyday). 

So basically my question is, what would it be like to sip on an ounce (MAYBE two if I don't take more Xanax) of the promethazine syrup and smoke a little weed while I'm on Xanax.

59mdmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/59mdmv/loperamide/,50,https://redd.it/59mdmv,Critical386,Loperamide.,"I don't get on this username anymore. The picture's of all these opiates just make me want to use. I know some people can handle it - I can't. That was step 1. Step 2 for me was trying to detox. I've done it before cold turkey, but I guess that only worked because I was hundreds of miles from anyone that I knew that sold drugs. This time I tried loperamide. I bought a 88 cent 12x2mg pack from walmart and took all of them. After about 3 hours i felt about 40-50% better. After trial and experiments, i realize that for me, a 225lb man, about 48mg is dose that will make me feel 85-95% better. I don't get the liquid filled one because for some reason they will sometimes make my stomach feel like someone is stabbing me. I stick will the little green pills.

After waking up every morning feeling like crap, only thinking about how im going to make money to get high or at least take the withdrawals away. I now get up about 3-4 hour before i'm supposed to really get up, take my 24 loperamide, fall back asleep, and when I wake up, I usually feel much better. It usually lasts about 18-24 hours. But it's not a cure-all.

I've now realized i've went from 1-2 pills a day, to 1-2 every other day, to 1-2 every couple days, to now about 1-2 a week, and now sometimes i'm even skipping a week every now and then. It's a slow process. I've went from the daily habit to the weekly habit in about 5 months. But I am getting there. I'm working now and best of all, I don't wake up with my body SCREAMING that i need pills to fix it, or at least if it does, I fix it with some loperamide, which is fixed at less than 2 dollars, and actually fixes the problem for the day, instead of prolonging it.

Disclaimer: This may not work for you - some of my friends have tried it, and they said it gave them stomach cramps, like I said, I get those when I take the liquid filled ones sometimes, not sure if they took those, or if they just have a weak stomach (I can just about eat anything and not have stomach issues). Start small (12mg), and if it doesn't work, try a different brand or formula. I once took 48mg of the liquid filled kind and i felt like I was dying my stomach hurt so much - so much that the only thing that made me feel better was making myself puke. SO START SMALL.

Also, it takes a LONG time for these to start working. Like 3 hours. I usually wake up to piss around 5:30/6 in the morning and take them (taking about 24mg, waiting 3-4 minutes, then taking another 24mg). Around 9PM i feel fine - add some caffiene and I usually feel great.

I also usually only take them for 3-4 days, about 12 hours after my last dose of oxy. After that I feel fine, and my stomach start to get back to normal.

Lastly, this option works for me, it may not work for you, maybe suboxone is better for you? (Suboxone wont work for me because I just ended up shooting it and getting high, plus its about the same price as pills here - so I might as well get pills) Just because 1 thing doesn't work, try and try again - if you really want to get off opiates. Only you know that. I've tried cold turkey, suboxone, methadone, tapering, kratom, weed, xanax, and finally loperamide. Not saying the others don't work, but just some work better than others (kratom for example, worked pretty well, but again, was more expensive than loperamide, and less readily available where I live).",1477545955.0

Only today I actually still had opiates left from the day before.  I had 60 mg of oxy, which is enough for that good morning high and to keep me well all day. ( my useage is far more under control than in the past). 

After enjoying that initial high and coming back to normal I started my job hunt as I'm currently unemployed. Sent my resume to a few places and got a call back right away and set up an interview for later in the afternoon. 

Checked my bank account after breakfast and determined that i could buy myself 4 more 30s. So i hit dude up and he says he's good around 4 p.m. when he gets off work. Things are looking good. My job interview was at 3 and my pick up was at 4. Both in the same area of town to which is a plus considering afternoon rush hour.

At about 1 my fiance walks in and gives me my mail. I start going thru it. 2nd letter i open contains a check for $128.00 from the oral surgeon who pulled a tooth about 3 months back. They must have overcharged me and are now reimbursing me. What's the 1st thing my junkie self does???? Call my dude back and up my order from 4 to 8 30s.

Not a crazy junky jesus story. Thats why I said one of his angels. But now I know i get to get a little high and not feel sick until at least Sunday and probably be feeling good until Tuesday morning, which is perfect because my unemployment check posts overnight monday/tuesday. All is right in my world today. That shit never happens to me especially in the medical world. Usually if i get something from the Dr. or dentist it would be a bill for $128 not a check.",1477542455.0

Received 300mg of flubromazepam and 3 subs from the DNM and immediately downed what I thought was 8-10mg.  Came to 3 days later in the hospital.

  I nearly fought a friend because I picked up a sub for him and he didn't wanna give me any so I just took a quarter and he didn't like that, several people at work witnessed this.  Then I proceed to go back to work.  All of this is what I was told mind you, but I kept making cups of coffee, leaving them around, then making another(about 5).  Stood at the office door and said I was working on a science project and they wouldn't understand.  And finally threw pancake batter onto a co-worker because I was mad he was clocking out.

  I slept about two days and woke up on Tuesday and for dressed for work.  I thought it was Monday and my mother informed me it was Tuesday and she knew what was up since one of my coworkers is also my neighbor.  My mother showed me the empty bottle of flubromazepam which kinda blew my mind  Then it was off to the hospital where I finally come out of it(sorta).  I stayed the night I guess then I was dropped off at detox.

  I go to check myself in and they informed me I couldn't smoke cigarettes so I turned around and walked outta there.  I started walking down the street and had no idea where I was, phone was off, and had no money for a bus so I figured I was stuck with going to detox.  I head back, bag up my belongings, put on some hospital gown-esqe clothing and head to bed.  It wasn't so bad, we had three square meals a day, group therapy, and lots of time to do whatever.  All of the opiate addicts tended to gravitate to one another.  Got some clonidine one time and ativan for the rest of the time.  They wouldn't give me ativan unless my pulse was 100+ so I'd do jumping jacks in the bathroom before dosing time.  My mom brought me clothes and candy the first night she visited and her friend brought nicotine patches the second.  

  I left Friday though they wanted to keep me till Monday but shit, I have bills so I'd rather work my two 12hr shifts for the weekend than continue that. Tried to leave my nicotine patches to some girl who was really going through it but they wouldn't let me :(.  I went to some outpatient type deal I don't think is gonna work out.  I was late for orientation so they turned me away and I'm supposed to go next week.  I think I'm just gonna try to do the methadone thing tomorrow.  Hope I get dosed because I can't afford to buy anything off the street, I have to see a sub doc or something.  The whole thing opened my eyes to a lot of shit so I guess it's time to turn myself around.

TLDR:  Took 300mg of flubromazepam in the span of 3 days, made an ass of myself at work yet kept my job.  Went to hospital then detox.  Detox went better than I thought, was dosed with ativan 3x a day and it was chill in general.  Had some realizations and gonna go to the clinic or sub doc.

I've been on prescription opioid for over 10years now. I lost my ability to work a few years back and I'm going through disability appeals.

With no insurance I have charity care that makes visits $10 and most meds very cheap. Downside is my only doctor that could prescribe opioid medication was a very long drive. I never drove while on my meds and since my piss was clean they cut me off. We have very strict dwi laws on meds even if prescribed and with a disabled child I didn't want to risk the chance of jail. I never knew not taking my meds to obey the law would make me lose them. Great system...

Anyway no other doctors that take charity care prescribe opioid meds except pain management and I've been on that waiting list for 2 years now.
I can't go through withdrawal. I've done it once and for a year I felt like a year long flu with extreme depression and zero energy.

I called today and explained my situation to a local rehab and they told me to come in for a suboxone assessment. 
What exactly is that? I'm already eating Imodium like candy but should I stop to go in more miserable? I know that sounds dumb but I really don't want them to reject me thinking I can get over this soon. I've been on this stuff so long and have a high tollerance. 

After my ankle fusion the meds they gave me were a joke and I went to the hospital explained my tolerance with proof of my meds and how long I'd been on them. I was given 180mg oxycodone, 60mg mscotin, and 4mg diluadid to take daily. I was still in pain but not near as bad as I was.

Also does suboxone do anything for pain or will it just keep me from being sick and miserable, hopefully able to function normally until I ever get into pain management. 

Sorry for all the text. I hope I made sense. I'm just so worried because my son is getting where he needs his wheelchair more and needs a lot more help in general and I can't be suffering and having bones that feel like glass and all the other horrible withdrawal stuff.

If you read all this I really appreciate it and I hope you are all doing ok.",1477503372.0

I wanna know if subs can rub off on one another if they stick like I described. If it does will my 0.5mg strip be more than 0.5mg? maybe less? Is that even possible with subs? I'm not sure, I just don't want to ruin my dose. Sorry if this doesn't make sense. Any help will be much appreciated!

I quit a 6mo habit of snorting H back in June. Wasn't a huge habit. Each pack that is (supposed to be) a quarter gram (they come in folded lotto papers here), would last me a few days. Got to about 30 days and started fucking off again, but not too bad. I was snorting one line a day, making sure to keep it at one line, period. But I was starting to do that consecutively..so that's how my "" chipping"" worked out. I quit doing that for a while but was staying ""well"" by popping norcos or some vics here and there. 20mg of norco would not get me any noticeable ""high"" but I wasn't sweating and then freezing and shitting myself and all the other glorious things that come with withdrawal. I had a very important event October 2nd that I didn't want to be at, but by association I had to be. So I got one pack for that trip. One line for the morning to give me that boost to get my entire family ready, dressed up nice and out the door for a 2.5 hour car ride, a line for the event, and one for the day after. Well of course when I got home, I came across some extra money and picked up more. So, since October 2nd (I was going to participate in that Sober October someone posted about, HA!) I have been using every day. My use is still minimal I guess, comparitively speaking. The packs never weigh what they're supposed to, so some days I'd open a brand new pack and it would only be a good line and that's it. Others could stretch 3 days..so I haven't been able to precisely measure my use.

 I had an opportunity to make some money last night as I did my last fat ass line yesterday morning. It could have split into two, but hey ya know how we work. With the money I had the chance to make, it was enough for 5 packs. Fuck yes! I'd be set today and the weekend, and be feeling great for Halloween and such. As fate would have it, the money fell thru and we couldnt make it happen last night, and Dboy had a narcotics detective call one of his 5 phones last night, I don't know anything other than that, or how they got his number, but it's not too hard to guess. Dboy decides it's best to shut down shop for a while until he can get shit figured out. Sure, my guy has other people, but you really don't get what you pay for. We don't have those sweet little stamp bags, it's either folded lotto packs which have always seemed to be the best you can get here and the most accurate weight for the money you pay. So, fuck it. Of course my money option texts me this morning and wants to try again today. But with dboy being gone, I won't get near as much for the money, it will maybe last 2 days rather than over 5 days. Fuck that. 

I promise I'm almost done rambling, stick with me! I have decided I might as well just stop. Thank fuck I don't seem to get as sick as some of the people I've seen post on here. If only I had a magic wand for some of you. I don't have much trouble with sleep, and I do not have the option to lay around all day. I will be in the comfort of my own home though. So here's where I want your tips, opinions, what you'd do if you were me. 

In my stock (it's pathetic I know, shit is hard to find in my area) I have 10 morphine sulfate pills that are 15mg each, a few 10mg vics, access to valium, 33 25mg ER addys and 30 5mg IR addys and probably 6mg of suboxone. I wanted to try to use the subs last. I did a rapid taper twice, and it worked out fine. No w/d, and I really could have stayed clean if I actually wanted to. I obviously have lope too. So if you are me..how would you use these things to ease the withdrawal? I know morphine pills are such bullshit and the only reason I have them is someone actually gave them to me. I would much rather a percocet or something. But hey, gotta make do with what I have. Just wanted to utilize these to come down easier, and maybe use the subs at the end , 3 or 4 days into no H.

Has anyone else had something near similar happen? Id be fucking TERRIFIED***** and probably have the same reaction. **ANYWAYS.**

>1991: death year. Heroin, cocaine, pills, living in and out of fleabag hotels, street prostitution, the works. My escape from it all was to plug into the noise-fuck effect I got from mainlining speedballs. 
I'm gonna keep this short. Most of us know better than to do these particular drugs. A few years before this I thought I did. Our minds, though, they're tender things, really, and when support is pulled out from under you, and your connections to people and the world around you severed, and your own life's most meaningful objects taken from you (in my case, all my art and tapes being stolen or disappearing via various disasters) we are all too likely to fall into the slow-suicide syndrome. I don't really want to die, I just feel like I do all the time, so I kill myself slowly, hoping I won't notice. 
That's where I was at. 
The coke was too pure. I'd gotten it from a trick who was apparently at the top of the coke pyramid somehow so wasn't hauling cut street crap around in his suitcase. He'd given me a little thinking I'd just be snorting it. Would have been nice if he'd warned me about it being uncut. 
I almost died. I know I came very close to having my heart explode. I'd done speedballs before but this was a horrible, horrible overload. 
There's a difference between body-unawareness on a psychedelic and this kind of body-blanking. Because my body itself was not blanked, just ONE PARTICULAR NEUROCIRCUIT was cut: my ability to control my own muscles. 
Arms, legs, fingers, toes, voice chords, neck backandforth flailing flinging spasming. Thoughts ten thousand miles too fast to even know, only feel the vertigo of their passing. 
My companion (essentially junk-friend, these kinds of things are why IV users should NEVER use alone) saved my life by grinding four valium tablets into a powder and putting them into water and making me swallow it. In about four minutes the spasms and convulsions subsided and ten minutes later I was back in control and crying, feeling like every last bit of neurotransmission fluid I had was drained away but so thankful to be able to make my legs move the way I wanted them to and be able to do it effortlessly. 
It was my last experience with any IV stimulant and a few months later I went to rehab for a short time, got on methadone for the heroin addiction, and never touched a needle again. 
Coke is bad, bad, bad, bad stuff. I don't know why I'm alive. Or if there's a reason. This kind of luck isn't given out to many and I think I got the luck for about the next 10,000 years on that. **",1477665704.0

So, im hellllllaaaaaa fuckin busy lately  -  like, so much that I've not had time to use as much sadly even tho the money was there

So tonight my buddy brings over ab a 0.5g baggie of some good - like so good that I popped a full on boner In the middle of my second bump/line - and I'm not talking a chub! I'm talking a raging, in-heat crazy time boner. I decided to run with it- the busy past couple weeks have left me with no time to even rub one out in the shower maybe in 8-9 days (long time for me haha)

So I pull up some porn, and just as the H is starting to fill me with fake endorphins I busted an awesome and beautiful load. So relieving and relaxing. And tbh who doesn't like to give themselves some love lmao

So don't be afraid/ just wait for the right batch , let your body tell you when it's time to take a run for it and embrace the moment.  I had two more lines out and almost took some man-dope-porn but even that much of a distraction (pulling up my camera and having the porn disappear) was enough to spare myself from seeing my inbox full of guys bitching about me posting my dick- as if they don't see the exact same thing every time they whip out theirs haha

TL:DR - every once in awhile a batch of dope is enough to be boner-rific that you *can* bust that nut, and it's bomb. Don't make the mistake of letting the opportunity pass- id be super sad rn if I'd let my 4:40am moment pass me by lmao

I know naltrexone would likely induce withdrawal symptoms, but I have plenty of clonidine and benzos on hand. I was planning on only taking naltrexone for a few days or a week and keeping benzo use to a minimum since their withdrawals are worse than opioids.

I was also considering using an NMDA antagonist like Deschloroketamine not only to abate some of the withdrawal systems, but to aid in tolerance reduction as well. I read an article that concluded ketamine eased opioid withdrawal symptoms in mice not only when were given it, but .after the drug had left their system as well, indicating a tolerance reduction.

I've heard of people who got naltrexone in the vivtrol shot who said their tolerance was near baseline after it wore off.

She tried to shoot coke in her foot but the couldn't after piercing herself there many times. Now her whole foot hurts, the skin is hard where she pierced through, and her whole leg is in pain and unable to be stretched out. Will answer more if someone needs more info.

Edit: First off, thank you guys/gals very much for your help and positive words. She was released from the ER at about 7 am EST. I have to get to work now though, I just woke up. When I get off I promise I will give a detailed update of what the doc said and pics of what the release papers state. She is doing okay though, all things considered. I'll post again around 330am EST.

Edit 2: Sorry it took so long for me to give you guys closure, it's been a busy couple days. [Here's](http://imgur.com/IHZXK4u) her release papers. It doesn't say much because they basically told her they weren't sure what was going on with her. She has no insurance and is a drug addict, so I'm sure they weren't going to put much effort into helping her in the first place. They did do X-rays (found nothing irregular) and gave her a two pills of Valium before sending her on her way. Here's the really shitty part though. When she left the hospital she went straight to her methadone clinic to dose for the day. The doctor requested to see her because she had just gotten out of the ER and also had skipped two days this week. The doctor told her he wasn't going to dose her anymore until she checked herself into a rehab for her coke habit. There are no rehabs around here (Virginia Beach, VA) that will let you take your methadone while doing in-patient treatment. Now she is going to be kicking 115 mg. of methadone on top of trying to curb her cocaine cravings. I'm terrified of how this is going to play out. But when it comes to leg/foot all is good now.

Been snorting at least a gram heroin every day without fail for about 2 yrs, every day nasal blue and dilly use before that for a few years. I've gotten to the point where getting properly high off opiates is nearly impossible, but in the past few months I've noticed that I can't get stoned off my ass on weed anymore even after tolerance breaks, alcohol which I sparingly use was once able to put me on the floor in small doses, now I need huge amounts to feel buzzed. Benzos (mostly klonopins) I have to take at least 2mg to know I've taken any, and those are used twice a week at most. DXM? I need 90mg to feel even a little tired. Psychedelics seem to still work great (I use those maybe monthly). Cocaine doesn't produce even close the effects it once did. Here's the kicker though: I combine amounts of drugs that would be considered nuts and still feel nothing or almost nothing. Take tonight for example , a g of dope over the last few hours, 16 mg hydromorphone, 2 large glasses of wine, 2 bowls of weed and 1.5 mg of kpins. I feel 90% sober. I understand that my tolerance to opiates is to the point where I either gotta shoot or quit, but why can't I feel anything off of other things i don't use all that often? Have I fried my brain to the point I don't have any more feel good chemicals to release? No lectures or info on the drug mixing. I am well aware of what's dangerous and what's not. I am probably not as nervous of OD as I should be, simply because of the fact I can't even get high, I kind of wish I would be able to have that as a serious worry. I also realize quitting everything for a bit would solve that problem, it's something im considering. But the only answer I am looking for is to this question: Why can't I feel other drugs that I don't have a tolerance to anymore? Why can I mix fairly large amounts of 3-4 drugs at a time and barely notice a difference? Thanks y'all.",1477614221.0

If you look at my post history you'll notice I came into 60 oxy 30's a few weeks ago. I had been tapering from my last oxy journey with some subs, down to about .5 a day, when I decided to jump back to oxy, out of fear of very long sub withdrawal, rationalizing to myself if I can keep the dosage low (get to one 30 a day before stopping at least), that the wd may be harsher, but at least will be shorter, than coming off subs. I have a full time job and an infant son so I don't have the liberty unfortunately of taking 4-5, or hell, even 1 day to myself to just chill in bed and take care of me.


Anyways, getting back on the oxy felt like a roller-coaster ride compared to subs at first. Kind of a bummer to dose and already start to feel unwell in like 4-5 hours. I was eating them orally just cuz of the highest BA, but I hated the waiting around 40 minutes or so for my dose to kick in and for me to feel alright.


Starting last Wednesday, in order to address this, I decided to whip out my good old ECP container (just this little circular container with a screw on lid that's easy to insufflate directly out of). I went ahead and crushed 4.5 pills in there, and told myself alright, that's for the next 3 days. 


Since I've done that and switch basically purely to insufflation, days have felt much more normal. I wake up feeling a little gnarly, but mostly groggy, have a bowel movement read reddit a bit, and just before showering, I open up my little case of powder and take a little sniff. The day has begun. Nothing large by any means - I roughly sort of gauge it knowing how long I told myself this particular powder has to last. Little bumps, wait a couple minutes, repeat til I feel ready to take on the day. 

I pack up for work, and bring my little case and straw with me. When I get to work, I leave that shit in the car. Around just after lunch, usually, I start to feel the not-so-great feeling coming on - I make a quick trip to my car, which I park in the highest, unused level of the garage, take a few more toots, almost instantly feel fine again, back to work. 


After working the afternoon, I head home, and when I park in my garage, once again take out the tin, bump a bit, wait a minute or so (bump a bit more if necessary) then head inside, able to greet my wife and son in a great mood, feeling fine. Then usually one more bump around 10pm or so, and that's the day. 


I know my supply is dwindling. I just crushed up some more pills to re-fill my powder stash, but I was able to stretch that last 135mg out to three days as planned.


People at work don't suspect anything. I'm in a regular, happy mood all day, not nodding or anything - I come into work and leave work happy. At home my wife (who busted me before when I started sniffing H on the daily - apparently way too much cuz she noticed a change in me enough to snoop around my bathroom) as far as she knows thinks I'm totally fine, is appreciative of my help with our son, and everything is basically normal. 


It just feels really weird having this secret like, I'm a ticking time-bomb of health that needs to be wound every 4-5 hours, but otherwise am leading a totally normal life. I haven't taken a recreational dose in forever, but also haven't let myself go more then 5 hours aside from sleeping at night without a dose of oxy for weeks. 

I'm hoping if I continue to just wait til I feel the comedown coming on, and dose just enough to feel normal again, that I'll gradually reduce dosage naturally over time (another benefit to the powder vs. swallowing pieces of 30's that you know exactly what dose you're getting, allowing hopefully for a more gradual descent). At the very least, I hope, and so far seems to be the case, that my dosages won't increase, as I'm not really looking to get high. 


I'm just posting because I've honestly never been in this position for so long. I've binged for a few days, then got busted or stopped for fear of wd, and had to stop / switch to subs and start tapering or CT'ed a minor wd. I've chipped where I use once or twice a week but feel slightly shitty the other days. I guess it just feels weird having so much oxy and for the first time, having so many responsibilities in my life that I'm using so little, that I can't really relate to that ""daily struggle"" a lot of us here endure, who cop on the daily, and have a hard time knowing whether they will be well or not from day to day. 


I know I have at least 3 weeks of ""normalcy"" with the amount I have left. After that I'm not sure what I'll do - either lope, kratom, or both, my xanax script which I've been saving and maintaining with 1-2mg diclazepam every day instead, in combo with some ephenidine treatment to hopefully lower tolerance/physical dependence more quickly, and hopefully be able to go through wd without much trouble. 


Anyone else in a similar situation as me? Not clean, just physically dependent on a short-acting opioid, and using it gradually throughout the day to live a pretty much normal life, with no immediate worries about where your next dose is coming from? I've never been addicted to cigarettes before (though I'm smoked my fair share over the years), but I imagine this is basically what addicted smokers must feel like every day. You have your dose of nicotine, it wears off after a while, you smoke another cigarette and you're fine, don't give it another thought until you need another cigarette, but if you were to stop you'd turn into a mood-swinging, fiending, shit-feeling person after a while. 


Don't get me wrong, part of me wants to and constantly has intrusive thoughts to crush up 3 or 4 pills and rail them all at once and do some real flying, but the rational me, that is still very much intact through this journey, just tells me that's 2 or 3 more entire days of normalcy I'd be throwing away for a few hours of feeling slightly better than normal. 


TLDR: ""Functioning addict"" with just over 1000mg of oxycodone on his hands, just using enough (via insufflation) to feel ""normal"" from sunrise to sunset (as it stands about 40-60mg a day), just musing about his current situation. I'm eventually fucked, I guess...but right now...just living a normal life with bumps of oxy fueling the normalcy...I feel alright, and will for the next 3 weeks at least.

I have tried prazosin, propanolol, dilantin, tregritol, memantine, fasoracetam, verapamil, baclofen, concerta, and meloxicam. 

I've also tried other opiates, nucynta and norco. Both did not help or hit the nerve pain the same way.

Not sure what tramadol is the only one but I am looking for an alternative due to tramadol affecting serotonin and the sexual side effects it causes. Not opposed to other opiates.

Any suggestions?",1477608382.0

What's your guys favorite pst recipe as well? 

Mine is:

3/4 full 2 liter bottle of seeds

like a 4 or 5 table spoons (or a good squirt) of lemon juice

add hot water from the tap to cover the seeds an in or two

then shake for 10-15 mins and use the draining method (open the cap just a little bit)

then I put it on the stove on the lowest setting in a large skillet to reduce the liquid a bit so I don't have to drink so damn much I'm full as hell and forcing it down, trying not to puke and then end up pissing ever 5 mins.

I came across a post with a link to an article about a mother who OD'd with her baby in the back seat. 

I sat there disgusted. How could a mother do this? She brought her child to pick up? Shot up in front of him? Then continued to OD in front if him? The poor child. I began to comment ""what a piece of shit. 

I stopped mid line and thought to myself, who the fuck am I to judge this piece of shit mother, when I WAS that piece of shit mother. 

In previous posts pertaining to my guilt, I've shared stories about my drug use and my children. 

""What a piece of shit mom, picking up with her child in the car."" Wait. I can relate to this mother. Or at least, the ex addict in me can. I myself have picked up with my children in the back seat. Granted I knew the girl I bought from, who was a sweet girl and always gave my children lollipops. I would go to hug her and we'd exchange handfuls, never ever letting my children see the exchange. At the moment the secrecy wasn't to shield their innocence from my addiction, it was to hide it incase them mentioned it to Jeronimo. Ugh. 

""What a piece of shit mom, shooting up in front of her child"". Wait. Am I not the same mother who frequented a Cumberland farms rest room many times with children in tow? Yelling at them to turn around in the corner as I crushed and snorted a line off the the bathroom floor? Yelling and screaming at them if they turn around. Telling them that I needed to poop. Cmon, we all know I was plugged up more than a clogged drain. 

""What a piece of shit mom, driving under the influence with her child."" Wait, again. Am I not the same mother who would continue driving immediately after using? Thankfully always getting to our destination safely, but still. I was driving while under the influence. 95% of the time I was. 

What pieces of shit we used to be. Fortunately for this mother, she survived. She will live to have another chance at life. Hopefully get her child back.  Fortunately we ALL have had forth, fifth, sixth chances. The ex addict in me can relate, and I am only strong enough to be able to admit that because I am clean.

There were times where i would go months (and my bank account would be so thankful) without using and times when I would binge. Though, I never went through any noticable WD except this time. 

I have been using atleast everyother day since early august late july and never thought too much about getting addicted. I was/am going through some emotional turmoil and kinda turned off my giva-fuck switch and have been using as often as I can get it. Typically my doses were between 60 to 120mg a day. Less or more depending on varying circumstances. 

So I, for reasons I dont wish to disclose, decided to stop this past Monday. I bought 90mg and informed my parents of my issue and gave them complete control of my finances that day. By wednesday morning I was so sick I could barely get out of bed and there was no way I was making it to work. 

A family friend gave my parents a handful of narc 10's that they have been distrubuting to me in an attempt to ween me off. I took 30 mg of hydro yesterday and 25 today. I guess my folks plan is to cut off 5mg a day. 

Is this a good strategy? I have burned up all my vacation at work for the year and ran through most of my savings so I dont have the option of missing work in order to just go through WD normally. But this is my last stand. I'm not going back to living like that.

Sorry for the wall of text, but any suggestions or advice is welcomed. And sorry of this is the wrong sub for this, I read the about page and it seemed an appropriate place to post.

Edit: I got terribly bad news. I was told by a girl i had slept with recently that she was pregnant at the end of my taper and relapsed. This time i injected most of the doeses. I got very ill all last week and my doctor gave me tussonex which im using to try to taper off. That and i got like 15 grams of quality kratom from a friend.

Anyways I used after 30 days and felt as though I got maybe 50%-65% of the high from Roxies (roa insufflation).

I am now on day 44 post vivitrol and am worried that even a small dose, like 30 mg, may be overwhelming since they say your opiate receptors and tolerance reset after being on viv. Should I just do 45-60 mg since I didn't feel much on day 30 or should I play it safe and do 30 mg? Any and all advice is welcome. Folks with experience being on vivitrol please chime in!

Or so I've thought. I was under the assumption that these coins were 90% silver (Ikes) and 40% silver (Kennedys).  I had two big Crown Royal bags filled with both.  Must've been 10-15 lbs each.  Anyway, times is tough so I made the tough call to dig into those bags to get some much needed money.  I wasn't expecting to get collectors prices for these coins, only their weight in silver.  This is why I'd been saving them.  Take them to a jeweler today, this guy tells me that two... Fucking TWO of the one hundred coins I brought to him were in fact silver.  The rest were nickel/copper.  Two yall.  So now a bit distraught I return home to bring him rest of the coins to either A) be completely crushed or B) find out I'm holding at least something. 

Find out they're all nickel and copper.  Except the two.  Told me he'd give me 6 bucks for them.  A lifetime of collecting these bitches.  6 dollars.  I kept them on GP.  He must have seen it in my face because he gave me a sincere ""I'm sorry, it's not uncommon though"" and as I was leaving he told me ""Son, honestly you should just take those to the bank as they're in such poor shape they're worth face value only, and that's the God's honest truth.  Keep them if they have sentimental value but otherwise..."".  Now like Marlo Stanfield said ""I'm not much on sentiment"",  I'm into the real value of things.  And these things are worth 1 dollar and half a dollar respectively. 

Make it so bad my pops gave a lot of them to me to start me off.  I don't have the heart to tell him A) I'm trying to have my coins melted and B) most if not all of his coins are most likely just like mine.  I can't be the bearer of that news to my dad.  At least he has his uncirculated mint proofs from every year from 1940 on and they're worth something but still... Totally fucking blown. 

Anyway, shit sucks.  Landlord just gonna have to understand.  Days like these really try my patience.  

I'm rambling.  Hope your day is better than mine thus far lol.

So recently I decided to try my luck with a few fent analogues, primarily furanyl-fentanyl (fu-f), but also butyr-fentanyl (b-f) and U-47700 (U-4). The U-4 was extremely caustic and really hurt my nose when I snorted it and killed the few veins I had left (some frightening issues when I missed in my neck; treated and healed/healing now) not to mention having to do way more than either fent analogue. Also the b-f was only ever mixed with the fu-f so I don't really know what it is like on its own. So it is primarily the fu-f that I'm wondering about alternative roas for, as I mentioned I have snorted and shot these chems but after all the punishment I've inflicted upon my arms and hands over the years I pretty much have no veins at all left, sometimes I get lucky and can register and get it but it it's sort of more hassle than it's worth at this point, although that is my #1 preferred method. Now snorting seems to work well enough, but I need to use about double and it takes about 15-20 minutes really peak, making me want something that would be a bit quicker and hopefully even give a rush in some way. I'm wondering how one would potentially smoke the fu-f, if it would be the same as smoking ecp off of foil or if there was another better way. Also, I'm not entirely opposed to plugging although I'm not the keenest on that method for the obvious reasons, I have tried it in the past with other chems and had poor results. As a final thing to say I just want to let you all know that I am being extremely careful with these chems and I know just how deadly they can be, I have a massive tolerance and I'm on mmt, as well as never using alone and always having narcan on hand. Any and all advice is appreciated, though preferably from someone with experience with these analogues or others.

I know I can't score again until Monday or Tuesday. My current stash is completely enough for me to have fun with and not get into withdrawals until even Wednesday.

However it's always the same, I'm not able to be patient and wait between my shots. My first one of the day was at 9 am, the second one at approx. 11.15 am. The second one gave me no noticeable effects which is the case for about 60-70% of my shots.

I can't even wait 4 hours, that's the minimum time for me to feel something again if I up my dose. It's like I'm shooting just to shoot ...

It's the same cycle every week. I usually score on Friday for the weekend and end up having to work on Monday with withdrawals kicking in because I could barely save a bit for a small shot in the morning. If I'd be able to wait at least 5-8 hours I could make it until the middle of the week with the amount I bought on Friday. That's more than enough time to score again.

The best feeling is to wait until you feel the withdrawals starting and then doing the next shot. It usually takes about 8+ hours for me to feel the first signs. However I'm already feeling uneasy after 2-3 hours, then I'll struggle for a few minutes in an attempt to wait just to give up and do my next shot which won't give me effects.. at the moment I'm in withdrawals every week, if I'd just be able to wait I would almost never be in withdrawals and also have good effects with every shot.

Are you able to wait an appropriate time between your shots? If I'd at least get some effects even if I won't wait it wouldn't be that bad, but I'm simply wasting a big amount of my dope.

TLDR: I'm wasting my dope because I'm not patient enough to wait between my shots, are you able to wait and if so, do you have any advice for me?

I would label it with different names/numbers based on the quality and I would break it up burn it in 4 layers of grocery bag and squeeze the air out, then I would seal it in 2x sulfane from a cigarette pack and store in a air tight pill container ( i am positive it is air tight) rarely would ever open this container.. probably have about 9 grams of different quality shit/color ect stored in there.. I also had a few ""caps"" and a few ""stamps."" The majority of my shit was ""raw"" and yes its actually raw. Of course raw varies in potency and is always cut with a binder or some filler holding it together.. but as far as ""rerock"" or""bricked up"" it is pretty genuine raw. I would also rotate the bags/sulfane/container every 4-5months just to make sure.

My question is this.. I have done the raw (I would pull some out every now and then when my people would have some weak shit) so I could still get high that day.. the raw seems to hold up perfect..same taste/smell/feels the exact same as when I got it.. however my caps which i am 100% positive were cut with benita as I would watch my boy cut and cap the shit(as all caps/stamps are cut) did not seem to hold up to well.. they seemed much weaker..

I've searched alot on the internet but it's VERY hard to find any consistent information regarding storage of Heroin other then keep it out of light, air tight, dry and away from moisture and shit.. it can degrade from oxygen and water will turn it back into morphine. 

Do any of you have any experience storing Heroin for a long period of time and did you notice any potency loss? Some of this i feel is placebo in my head.. as i've had other shit kept for a yr + and did it and thought nothing of it being any weaker at all.. but now after reading shit on the internet it's made me ocd as fuck about if any moisture got in or if certain bags I had were air tight from the start. All my raw is ECP and the caps and stamps were as well (raw cut with benita) Also when heroin is transported/stored or sitting in warehouses it is most DEFINITELy not kept in ideal conditions and it obviously holds up by the time it is in our hands and god knows how long that took in the first place.

So here's where he's at:

Last two weeks, he's been smoking .3 of BTH a day.

Two weeks prior to that, he was smoking just a point or 2 a day, a few days a week.

His last dose was .1 roughy 36-48 hours ago, and was all he smoked that day.

He took 8mg of Lope around 9am, and another 8mg about 2hrs later.

Hit me up this afternoon and said he didn't feel any relief, so he took 8 more Lope, along with 10mg hydrocodone.

I managed to find him some sub's from an old connect and he just picked up 3/4 of an 8mg subutex.

Can y'all help me out with when he should start the sub's, and how much he should start with?

He's worried taking the sub after taking the hydro will induce wds, but I doubt it.  And 2mg should be more than a sufficient starting dose, right?

Sorry for the novel, and thanks in advance for any and all advice!!

Let's suppose that costs you $150.   That's $4500/month. 

My understanding is that synthetic opiates like carfentanil are about 10000 more potent than heroin.    

A gram of carfentanil should roughly equal 10000 grams of heroin, or 27 years worth.  Therefore, 2.5 grams of carfentanil should be enough to provide a lifetime's supply (70 years).   Let's assume a gram of carfentanil costs $2500/gram.  2.5 grams would therefore cost about $6,250, or less than 2 months of heroin. 

Why don't more heroin addicts buy themselves a lifetime supply of carfentanil?

I believe my boyfriend has relapsed today.. or yesterday.

Yesterday however he just claimed he got stronger (other stuff) and same with today. His face gets slightly swollen and puffy when he uses, as well as his lips get red and his eyes are obviously messed up. 
I confronted him politely about it earlier today but he just said again, he got stronger other stuff. We've been together for years now, and while he's a user, I've never been, I've never even touched drugs. 
So from any of your point of views... what should I do? 
He wouldn't ever admit to doing it no matter how much I cry, scream, beg or plead. Because he knows how badly watching him overdose hurt me and he doesn't want to make me upset. I'd rather him tell me, but since he most likely won't... what should I do..",1477709942.0

So I made the mistake of using ridiculous amounts of cocaine while manic... I've had manic episodes before and have learned to control them. But this shit. This was drug induced psychosis. Of course they saw everything in my system when I was drug tested in the psych ward. I was discharged 7 days later and it was strongly recommended that I go to rehab. It's intensive outpatient treatment but it sucks... Here I am telling a room full of other addicts and alcoholics what drugs I preferred and how shitty of a person I am while abusing them. Or how amazing life is when I'm on opiates... But to the program, a drug is a drug. 

I'm not sure what to think or feel. Some days I'm so thankful I didn't hurt anyone or hurt myself, drive while I was drunk or high, never been arrested, great support system, still have my job and short term disability... So yeah. I'm extremely grateful. I know there are many people out there that would kill to have those things. But these 12 step meetings, narcotics anonymous, blah blah... It's just a lot to take in. I've started to really open up in group therapy. Some people are cool and understanding. Some people judge. Some people try to ""save"" me before it's too late and invite me to a thousand AA, NA, CA, etc meetings. Ugh.

Of course I have to remain clean while in the rehab program so I'm two weeks clean, ha. I suppose that is something to be proud of. I'm certainly saving money... Withdrawals are gone but I still feel like I'm mourning a fucking loss or something not taking my percs everyday. I used them as a crutch for so long and now they're gone. I'm glad I never got into H all that much... Not sure how those of you that've gotten clean got through that but it sounds like it's 100x worse. 

Not sure where I'm going with this, just thought I'd reach out to some people I thought might understand rather than a room full of strangers judging me when they're addicts too.

I got written up for it (you get 3 write-ups before you get kicked out, it was my first one) and looked like an asshole trying to argue against the infallible laboratory piss test my doctor conducts. 

I had to wait two motherfucking weeks before I could see my doctor again, and today I finally did. I was super nervous going in. Usually I like to dose my suboxone at night because it helps me sleep. The last two weeks I've been taking my Friday dose before I even go in for my test to see if it can get my levels up to where they need to be. I kept every half film in my mouth for 30 minutes, and made sure I followed everything to a tee. 

I get in there today and my doctor tells me that my levels are better, but still not where they need to be. I didn't get written up, but the doctor asked me if I drank a lot of caffeine. During the week I drink one or two cups of coffee a day so I said yeah. He said the caffeine might be diluting my urine and that holding off on the coffee on Fridays (the day I go for my test) could help get my levels up. 

I said OK because I'm very scared of getting fucked over with this flimsy test system they got there. It's not a big deal for me to skip the coffee in the morning, but I usually don't have coffee before I take my test anyway. I get Friday's off so I usually wake up, hold my piss, drop my sample, and go about my day. 

I'm highly skeptical that caffeine is the issue here, though I am still willing to try it just to see what happens. My doctor made a comment about my urine being ""diluted"" by the caffeine, which made my body flush the sub out of my system quicker than usual. I tend to drink a lot of water anyway, it's one of the only healthy habits I have. I wouldn't be surprised if any dilution they saw with my piss just came from my normal water intake, but I'm obviously no expert. 

So, what I'm asking is, has anyone experienced something similar? Is the caffeine thing a legitimate factor? ",1477705393.0

Will Subutex show on a drug screening?,"There seems to be a lot of disagreement on this subject so if anyone has accurate info about this please let me know.

I am prescribed 6 mg subutex daily (usually take between 3mg to 5 mg, occasionally 6 mg daily.) The new job I got hired at asks ""What medications are you on or have allergies to in case of an emergency?"" I feel like this violates HIPPA regulations in asking me what prescribed meds I'm on. I don't want to be turned down because I have a subutex script (and we all know what that's for) but it looks like that MAY or MAY NOT (?) do a urine or hair drug test.
I am clean from all drugs that I am not prescribed so I am only doing my subutex and xanax which I am prescribed, although I don't think its my new employers business to know my past and not hire me because of it.
My choice is to not disclose the medications I am on and possibly take a drug test. Would buprenorphine even show up in a ""DRUG PANEL 5"" or ""DRUG PANEL 10"" (the service codes listed at the top of the form.) and if it does do I have a right to say I am on those meds but I don't legally have to disclose that information?

I don't know what to do. This is my dream job and I've worked hard to get here. I don't want my past to fuck it up since I'm not even taking any drugs other than what I am prescribed. I don't think its fair that they ask what scripts I'm on and then the next page makes me sign to allow myself to be possibly drug tested.

So basilly I'm asking:
1. Do I legally have to disclose what meds I'm on which will clearly be disclosing my past?
2. If I am subjected to a DRUG5 or DRUG10 panel will buprenorphine actually show positive as ""opiate""?",1477680890.0

I also understand this helps to prevent the syrup from sticking to the insides which would happen in the beginning of summer which as I recall is when they started adding it to every dose, even if not requested. 

  Anyhow I've been searching for a solution myself and I know that some chemicals including vinegar are used to kill/prevent mold, so I'm wondering, save for ruining the taste which I would not mind if it worked- 
 if adding a few drops of vinegar/maybe another acidic solution? to my bottle would prevent mold from forming and not destroy any of the methadone? And are there any negative affects from long term refrigeration?

It's not like opiates are a new thing. They've been around forever. When the World War 2 ended there were lots of people addicted to morphine/heroin or Pervitin or both. Then came the drug laws thanks to United fucking Nations. Drug problem stayed and nothing really changed, except LEOs swarming around drugs like dung beetles in a pile of shit. Not to forget comedy gems like Reefer Madness, you know stoners walking around and raping people and bullets won't penetrate their semen hardened clothing so cops have to aim in the head. But life continued. Then came 2016 and people noticed that ""normal people"" got addicted too. A massive outcry like it was goddamn killer bird flu pandemic. This documentary i got this topic idea from says: ""real people addicted to prescription drugs and heroin. In their own words, ordinary people from various walks of life describe the horrors of addiction and how their addiction changed their lives forever. It's real and disturbing"" 

Hey, listen. Real people has been addicted to opiates since the opium was found. They just weren't soccer moms and engineer dads. Apparently it hasn't been ""real and disturbing"" enough.. 

Why is this? Are we not 'real people'? Maybe i don't count because i am not making +200k per year and i don't have house full of young tax payers. This just irks me but maybe i should be happy that their eyes at least glanced this problem quickly. Not that it reduced any of the suffering because the reaction was honestly the most retarded; cut off the pill supply and force them into heroin. That's so smart it's probably off the scale.

5acgv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5acgv7/the_disease_model/,16,https://redd.it/5acgv7,-OrangeAristocat-,The disease model,"So the current accepted theory is that addiction is a disease, a mental disorder. Both the healthcare industry and 12-step programs define it as a disease. Years ago before I identified as an addict, I didn't agree with it bc I thought people would use it as a crutch, like a way to avoid responsibility for their actions and blame everything on their disease. My knowledge on the subject actually came from a South Park episode on AA lol. 

But over the years I've learned a lot. I was clean for three years and heavily involved in NA and I learned why it was important to accept the disease model. It's a little better to think of it as I have a genetic disposition to addiction that I have to take responsibility for and treat it like a mental illness, rather than thinking of myself as a shitty person and I don't deserve help and I'll die alone with a needle in my arm. 

But here's my problem. In NA they say that addiction is a disease bc it's incurable, progressive, and fatal if untreated. They say it's just like diabetes or cancer, and the 12 steps are an addicts medicine. But I've never heard of a diabetic being kicked out of where they were living and their girlfriend, friends and family cutting off contact with them because they were diabetic or they found their insulin vials. Society doesn't look down and spit at cancer patients for having cancer. I just really don't think non-addicts fully accept the disease model of addiction. Of course, I understand the enabling factor, and also addicts can get so desperate that they will steal from anyone to fund their habit. Not everyone, but I've done it and know a lot of people who have, and it's a horrible source of guilt I have to live with. 

I live in the US and I think it's great that Canada just implemented that program several countries in Europe have with the government providing heroin to addicts as a last resort. What do you guys think of that program? Do you think the best ""medicine"" for treating addiction is 12-step programs/therapy and suboxone/methadone maintenance? Or is the best way to treat the disease of addiction to give addicts pure heroin in a sterile medical setting, combined with therapy? 

I have many problems with 12-step programs nowadays. Like I said, I was heavily involved with one from 2010-2013 and totally believed in it. But I went through some very unfortunate circumstances and I've become severely disillusioned with it and I've tried going back, but it's not the same. They key ingredient in the success of 12 step programs is blind faith, and I honestly believe they are pushing an illusion that you're not supposed to question. At this point I would love to receive pharmaceutical heroin from a clinic. What do you guys think? Whats your opinion on 12-step programs and the disease model? ",1477923511.0

When i scroll through this sub, most of the time I see many posts of users, who are addicted, some of them wanting to quit.
Myself having experience with psychedelics, mdma, dxm and weed I cant imagine how fast and 'hard' opiate-addiction can hit you (I just tried codeine once and of course did not get addicted). So my questions now:

1. How fast did you get addicted in means of how often and on what regular basis did you use it resulting in the addiction. 

2. Are there some of you who use opiates on a regular basis, without beeing addicted? If yes, how often and how much are you using?


Edit: I'm asking this because I am pro safer drug use, but I'm not sure if one is capable of using opiates without developing an addiciton

Edit2: seems like I offended some guys here by just asking questions. I dont see anyone of the users as junkies(in means of looking down on consumers), I'm just interested.

I have 6 herniated discs, ddd, cervical and lumbar stenosis, nerve impingement, etc. my leg gives out a lot so I fall constantly. finally, after 2 years of getting worse and worse to the point of currently being bedridden and having to use a walker to get anywhere (I'm in my early 20's), got some scripts from my Dr. 

Nothing crazy yet, but going from nothing (besides ibuprofen) to Percocet, Valium and gabapentin, has it so I can atleast get out of bed for a few minutes, shower myself, smile for a few seconds, etc. I'm no where near pain free, but even at a 7/10 I'm much better off than I was a week ago. 

Those scripts are from my gp who is willing to medicate me until the new dr sees me. my appt with my new neurosurgeon isnt too far out and he has a pm doc that works in the same practice so I'll be able to (hopefully) adjust to something that maybe gets me down to a 5/10. I'll also definitely be getting surgery at some point, so that will help get something a little better. I also stopped self-medicating with blues about 3 months ago, so I can actually feel and get some relief from the percs now that I'm not blowing 90mg of oxy at a time. 

There's no real point of me rambling, other then to say to anyone who is fighting with real pain management issues- don't give up. You will find relief somewhere. Not all doctors are heartless. And I hope you all get the relief you need soon.

Very important","Mods can vouch, I'm not on here representing some BS news story or T.V. show. I am in the harm reduction field in Texas, typically I'm on here giving away Narcan but right now I need some assistance from you guys.

I am lecturing at a seminar on Friday to a large group of medical professionals and nurses through a partnership with a large nonprofit hospital. Texas has finally decided to get its head out of its ass and actually deal with the fact that we have a problem we need to address.

At this particular seminar I will be speaking on how medical professionals can help moms (and dads) who are addicts (specifically opiate addicts) and get them in touch with resources. Also I will be touching on the topic of how medical professionals can be more supportive (i/e personality and behavioral traits: non-judgemental, more approachable, client feels like they can turn to them, ect)

So my question is, what really helped you guys out (federal programs, shelters, detox facilities, groups, rehabs), what hindered you from getting help (felonies, discrimination, lack of resources, fear), and how do you think medical professionals should treat parents dealing with this type of stuff to build trust. 

I welcome your good and bad stories and advice/assistance. You can PM me if you like (absolutely no one's username or any info will be used in this lecture, I am just trying to gather resources to help out the community).

We've been clean from oxy/dope for more days than not for the past couple of months, but have been buying methadone off of the street to accomplish this the whole time. 

We both have appointments this week and really weren't told much, but after some research I have two concerns...

1. Is the fact that we are physically dependent on opiates, even though we have been mostly maintaining via methadone enough? Methadone is the only opiate that will show up in our initial drug tests- so I'm wondering if we need to use another opiate just to prove that were not just looking for methadone...

2. I knew that 1 year of dependence was a requirement for admission, but I just read that evidence of that history needs to be documented. How strict is that? What types of evidence are needed? (Neither of us have been to a rehab, if that's what they need to see)

Oh and one more that my SO is worried about- will testing positive for alcohol or benzos on the initial cause denial? From what I've read, it's okay for the first test, they just won't dose you until your drug screen is clear of alcohol or benzos- but he's not convinced, so if anyone can confirm or counter my belief...

Thanks in advance. I was so damn happy that we finally had appointments (It was extremely difficult to even get to this point) and could finally be on a legitimate treatment plan and not playing doctor with ourselves and worrying about running out all of the time...

I just want to share my own great experience with PM so that it can be used as a baseline for people currently in PM to see if they are being treated correctly or not.

If you have ANY questions please do ask, ask me anything, and I will do my best to answer truthfully.

Hi guys. I'm mostly a lurker around here although I do post from time to time, and since joining r/o one thing that I always see come up is ""horror"" stories about pain management. They have become so frequent around here that it seems like everyone knows someone who's had a terrible experience with PM.

I however had an amazing experience with PM, but as I am currently living in France that also means that some things are going to be very different about the way patients are treated. I'll try as much as possible not to express too much my opinion on how people are doing things in the US and mostly concentrate on telling you what i think should be ""the perfect PM experience"" as i believe I came pretty close to it.

Beforehand i must tell you that for example i have never seen hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone ever in France. I did get prescribed oxycodone after being on morphine for a while, but most doctors dont even know what oxy is. The opiods used by french doctors are mainly codeine, tramadol, then straight to morphine, and eventually fentanyl.

Now our story with PM starts when my GP gave me a referal for PM when he thought that it was too much for him to handle and that PM could offer more than him. By going to a smaller regional hospital i got a first appointment in two months whereas there was a 6 months waiting list in the big parisian hospitals. The first appointment lasted around an hour and we went over all my tests as well as my current script. At this point my GP had already given me morphine and gabapentin and the PM doctor only suggested to add an anti depressant who had shown to also work on chronic pain (cant remember the name sorry), and to start making me see a psychologist working in PM. After a few months like this the doctor suggested to get me into a Ketamine trial they were running at the hospital. 4 months after my first appointment i did two 6 hours sessions on ketamine drips and it drastically reduced my pain lvl to the point that i could start walking again without help. Now you'd think that maybe they would drop me because hey i was basically cured but nop. I was kept in PM for 6 more months in order to properly do a very slow taper down as well physical therapy prescribed by the PM doctor.

Now during this year in PM i didnt only see the one doctor as it seems a lot of people do in the US. As i said it was strongly suggested (and i did for a while) to see the PM psychologist, and i regularly saw a nurse at first back when they tried electrostimulating to reduce pain (didnt work for me). On top of that I know for a fact that patients were discussed and their files reviewed by all the PM doctors as well as the psychologist and a psychiatrist and all the nurses at least monthly. On top of this incredible support staff never was I drug tested, or my pills counted, or i never even heard of someone being kicked out of PM. I even asked two times EARLY ON to get a refill early because my current dosage wasnt working for breakthrough pain and it was never a problem. Never the possibility of being dropped/kicked by PM was even suggested. I'm not even sure that i heard people talking about drug seeking behavior, the sole focus of that place was pain treatment and nothing else.

In all the doctors i've seen (and over the years i've stopped counting) the people in PM was really the most caring and the most accomodating i had in a very long while: for example i would usually had to come pick up my script at the hospital (i know in the us a lot of places call in the scripts directly to the pharmacy) because french law requires controlled substances like morphine to be prescribed on ""secured scripts"" (aka a special kind of physical paper) but one day i couldnt even walk to out of my appartment so the doctor emailed the script to my usual pharmacy and said told me to just come pick it up when i could during the week. Like I said they were all caring professionals and not scared doctors bullied by the dea into not trusting any of their patients.

TL;DR: OP shared his great experience with PM to help you all. Ask him anything he'll make sure to answer if possible.",1477879955.0

My friend called once, no answer tried again and got him on the phone.

Needless to say, my friend's joke backfired, immensely. My friend didn't say anything threatening to the guy, but the guy flipped shit.

I went into detox coming off of 60mg of Methadone, a bundle of raw ($120/bundle stuff in comparison to $50-80 bundle stuff), and roughly 20+mg of Xanax a day. 

It took a total of ten days to detox off all of it, I was given librium, phenobarbital (for seizures from xanax), and eventually at day 4 (72+ hours after my last methadone dose) I was fed a suboxone film. **A FULL FUCKING SUB FILM** 

Mind you, I had never taken suboxone films before, only subutex or those other ones that melt and taste like oranges cant remember the name. Subsolv? Idk. But I went into precipitated withdrawal because apparently the methadone was ""stuck in my bone marrow"".

Up until recently I loved opiates more than my children, my boyfriend, my job and myself. 

Opiates were my lover, my best friend, everything to me. I recently made the comparison of an addicts relationship with their DOC to an abusive relationship between a couple. 

After the initial date, you can't stop thinking about them. You want to see them more and more, as often as possible. You love the way they make you feel. You feel wanted. You feel needed. Most importantly you feel loved. 

Over some time they have a hold of you. You don't see it, yet your loved ones begin to suspect. They keep you from going to work and you lose your job. They take your money so you resort to stealing. When you try to leave they hurt you. You're stomach sick. Your body aches. Just one more chance they say, I will make you feel better. You give in. 

Months later the stress is wearing you thin. You've lost weight. You stop showing up to family engagements. When you are approached with concern, you lie. Everything is fine. You cover your bruises with make up. That night you're driving home, he took the control of wheel and drove you into a tree. 

Months later you know you need to get away. He is not good for you. Your family is concerned but he has such control over you. You're nothing with out him. You can't live with out him. You love him more than everything. 

You try to leave this abusive relationship yet again. You are hurting. You are sick. You miss him. You drive past his home, it triggers many memories of your time together. You decide to stop in. Maybe you can go slow. Maybe you can manage this abusive relationship. 

You can not. Your spirits are broken. You are defenseless. You are weak. 

The greatest thing you can ever do for yourself is to rid him from your life and never look back. 

So you finally do. This time you reached out to your family. With their support you begin the healing process. Bruises will heal. Memories will fade. You learn that life doesn't need to be this hard. You're able to find a decent job and start putting money away. 

After a few months free of his grasp you run into him. He begins promising you the world, everything you can possibly dream of. ""Just give me one more chance!""  You turn around and walk away. Fuck that noise. 

G'day all!
