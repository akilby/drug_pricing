I'm 22 and I work with some shady characters. In the past 6 months or so, I've begun to experiment with pharmaceuticals. Mostly a few 10mg Norcos here and there. I seem to have a naturally higher tolerance than most people I know. I tried some gabby a few months back and fell in love. I felt fine experimenting with that a lot, due to the general safety. I'd be taking ~6g/day sometimes and it was awesome. But lately I've become more enamored with opiates. One of my coworkers is a pill head with back problems so she's usually always got something or another. Well on Friday she got a script for blues and told me I could get some for $5 a pop. I jumped on it.

Here's my timeline since then.

Friday - 60mg chewed. (12:00 and 14:00)


Saturday - 60mg chewed. (09:00 and 12:00)


Sunday - 60mg chewed (08:30 and 20:00), 15mg snorted (12:00)


Monday, today - 90mg chewed (11:15, 14:30, and 21:00)

It's about midnight now. Feeling alright.

My question is... I gotta wake up in about 5 hours and that was the last of my stash. I won't be buying any more, even though I'm apparently getting a good deal. I want to know if I'll be feeling much of a physical comedown/withdrawal from using these for such a relatively short amount of time. I've never taken enough pills to get a real comedown so I'm not sure what to expect in the morning or tomorrow.

Also, I'm open for quitting advice. The other night I found myself googling and posting on here asking if taking another pill would be dangerous or kill me. I think this is a pretty good sign that I'm an idiot and that I need to stop playing with fire. I have a super addictive personality so I really want to nip this shit in the bud before I let it get any more out of hand, because I know things can go downhill very quickly before I'll even realize it.

Thanks for your help, guys.

EDIT: Also had a somewhat related question. Is it normal to have sleeping issues on opiates? I was always under the impression that they're meant to help with sleep and basically put you out, but they do the opposite for me. I'll be super tired, but once I fall 'asleep' I'll be waking up every 30-60 minutes, feeling like I'm in some weird half-asleep-half-awake phase all night. It's like a huge night long hallucination with vivid dreams where time slows down and when I actually wake up in the morning it feels like I've been in bed for 100 hours.

Some of you probably feel like a detox Yelp of sorts at this point. Weighing the facilities based on who has a bed first, chocolate milk or not, etc. 

Everytime I have been to detox, I watched groups of people get sick of it and leave. 

The best time was listening to my three roommates scheme. After weighing their options, they decided that the three of them, with no homes to go back to, only 24$ and a pack of smokes between them,  should leave the detox in Westborough, MA, and travel on foot an hour to the train station, scam their way into the train, make it to Worcester and score. 

They were completely convinced that this was the right choice for them. Detox was unmanageable and they wanted to use. 

It was like 20 degrees out. Worcester is like the coldest part of MA. 

Everyone else, for the remainder of our stay, would sit back and laugh at all the possible outcomes of where the three musketeers wound up. 

Another time, this kid gets into an argument with a counselor in a holding (place u go after detox while waiting for a bed at a rehab or sober house) and decided to leave. Literally eight hours later there is a story on the news about a bank robbery, with poor Detox Refugee's mug staring us down asking for help identifying, so funny. ",1410831400.0

I'm not writing this for suspense. but, fuck, I just have to write this down and get my thoughts out.. Today me and my friend that I met in rehab, and now lives in the same city with me got together and shot a couple bags. I did two and he did three. When I hit I was basically just like mm yesss thats actually a nice rush for once. When he hit, he got OBLITERATED and then suggested we go out to his car and listen to music. We were in there for  couple minutes before he completely fell out, and start making a weird choking noise first I yelled at him, then i gave him a couple slaps, nothing. I did that chest rub thing which I guess is supposed to really hurt and determine if a person is responsive to outside stimuli and still nothing. So I dragged him out of the car and started chest compression and mouth to mouth to get him to breath again. I have never done cpr or anything like that. I had no idea what I was doing. His lips had turned pale and then to blue. I was on the verge of calling the medics but we had shit on us and in my house, plus his family would've gotten involved and I didn't know If the town we where in had the law where the cops cant mess with you if you call for an od. No excuse, I feel guilty for  gambling with his life that way. But I finally got some color back into him and got him breathing again on his own, and I kept at it until he opened his eyes. When I saw his eyes open and focus on me I knew he was going to be alright. Probably the biggest relief I've ever had. He kept nodding out and puking all day and I took care of him and just let him rest at my house the rest of the day. I guess I should feel good that I saved my friends life today, but all I feel is traumatized. I just turned 20 a few days ago, I have court for a second offense tomorrow, classes that I cant keep up with, no money and pretty bad smack habit ( it was a bundle a day but I ended up going totally cold turkey last week so its less now, but still) and today I almost watched my friend die.

Take anywhere from 210-300mg morphine orally feel good

Notice when I take morphine, my ""general opiate tolerance"" is so high that my usual 30-40mg hydro does literally nothing. Never had that happen, where I feel nothing.

Even when I was taking ~80-100 mg in op oxys, I would take 3-4 Vic's and a) not feel shitty & b) only after a few days would I start feeling hydro again. I could be off morphine for a week and still nothing from even 50mg hydro.

The point of this post is coming, I swear, bear with me as I give u all the relevant info.

So, before morphine, during the op oxy phase, I got a chance to try a blue 30mg oxy. The one with a v on it. It was *amazing*. I don't remember If I took 1 or 1 1/2, I just remember thinking I felt the way I did the first few times I tried vicodin. Btw, if it wasn't for the Tylenol I'd be all about Vic's... Hydrocodone is the shit.


So, the point of this post, in the form of a question I have, is, if I have been regularly been taking morphine in the doses I mentioned, and I have access to two blues, which I intend on taking together in one dose, will the morphine affect my high the way it affected my high with vicodin?

I know oxycodone is technically more powerful than morphine (at least orally), so while that comforts me, I do not want this to go to waste. I've been generally lowering my tolerance so if I have to wait to be guaranteed a good high, I will. But I want to be sure of the outcome whenever I do it.

But the main point of it is to let you all know how I do. I miss being sober. I miss being able to be myself without taking a blue, yellow, red, green, white, or whatever other color they make to make us people deal with our every day lives. I remember days where I would smoke the the hell out of my brain with my homies and just laugh and eat an insane amount of grandma's cookies. Smoking weed morning, day, and night. Now...I can't wait to smoke a point or two as soon as I wake up. I don't even think about the weed. I only smoke that to keep me from getting sick. But. More so, I love the pills. I love how they make me feel invincible. I used to think I could stick to a system. Only a few. Every now and then. Build a routine you know, a schedule at some point. 

I think it was primarily because they all used to be so hard to get. Now, it just take a few phone calls. A couple texts. Sometimes. I don't have to lift a finger or even open my wallet, if i'm lucky. There's no way I could afford any of those other prices some of you guys in other cities are mentioning. Inhumane. Anyways, I miss those days, man, when I could put it together. When I used to walk into a marijuana dispensary and that would be the highlight of my day. When the color purple of the weed or the frosty sativa would make me jump for joy. When that tangy OG stank filling up my car or even on those fridays where I got my bonus got me some of that FULL MELT HASHISH was the business!!!. It's not enough these days. It hasn't been for at least a couple years. Shit, maybe more. I don't know if you ever remember when it is you EXACTLY cross over. You just know your already on this side. The side no one wants to be one. The one I don't one to be on but I continue. For the same reason you all do. Because I love it. Fuck It. Because I love how it make me FEELS. Fuck It.

I've heard people say the high is like heroin, just wanted some input as I've ever only taken etiz many hours after I dose.

Recently, I started spending my nights with a guy (who also uses) and he pointed out to me that I stop breathing for a good 10-15 seconds after almost all of my breaths after I fall asleep and wanted me to look into sleep apnea.  

Reading through the symptoms, I do have a bulk of them (dry mouth/dehydration, tired during the day, headaches in the morning, and frequently waking up with a jolt in the middle of the night.  But, I don't snore at all, which is one of the main symptoms of sleep apnea. 

I've always attributed these things to my opiate use.  Dope causes dehydration for me, being tired during the day could be because I don't sleep 100% when I'm nodding off and randomly waking up with a gasp could be me waking from a heavy nod.  Not snoring is one of the reasons I've never considered sleep apnea.

I never knew I actually stopped breathing for that much time though.  All in all, I'm not hugely concerned about my health - this was just something interesting that was brought to my attention.  I know you guys aren't doctors and can't diagnose someone over the internet, but do you have any other thoughts?

(Sorry if my spelling's off, writing this in PlainText on an iPad).

I was mugged at knife point today for my supply.

I was in my local downtown, (mid-sized town, tourist trap) trying to dump some pills for a friend — nothing much, just 30 5mg Vicodin. I usually only sell to a handful of people I know and trust, or people I get as connects from reliable sources (as in other dealer/user friends and associates).

 I was selling openly in this area for two reasons, one: I really needed the money and two: you can sell for higher prices downtown than in the rural boonies where I live and usually buy/sell/use. Two birds, one stone.

I know casually a lot of people in that area — this is the kind of place where people are usually very friendly and it's easy to meet people, people here are also very open-minded and non-judgemental, so even if I were to offer to sell pills to a non-user, there's hardly any occasion to fear the long arm of the law.

At this point, I'd been downtown for two and a half hours without selling anything, so I decided to go to the *known* druggies down in the park, I've bought from them before, but I'd usually have someone else with me... this time I was alone — and female (as always - ha).

I walk up to an open, friendly looking group of four men that I've seen around and talked to a few times. One of them was holding a stringed instrument, and they were all locals (if I revealed the instrument - but for shits and giggles I'll say it's a Japanese *shamisen* - and nationalities, I'd be giving away my location). I said the usual hello-how-are-yous and asked if I could sit down and roll a cigarette, asked for a lighter and lit it.

One of the men, the main one of the group it would seem, asked *me* if I was holding, I didn't even have to ease my way into bringing it up. ""Yeah sure, but they're only 5s, how many you need?""

He said he'd like $20 worth so I bring out the bottle and started counting out the amount to give him. I hadn't noticed this at the time, but two of the men casually got up and stood to my right and left, and the man with the *shamisen* stood behind me and started strumming his instrument, my guess is that it was to deflect public attention away from what was going to go down within seconds.

The main man, who was still sitting acress from me, reached out his left hand as if to recieve the pills, and at the same instant reached into his left jacket pocket with his right hand and pulled out a switch blade, flicking it open expertly. He then lunged at me and grabbed my entire bottle, stuck the knife in my face and said, all menacing, ""Get. The fuck. Out of here!"" That's how he said it, with the stops.

*Shamisen* man and the other two backed up, I sat up and bolted the fuck out of the park. I'm not sure if anyone saw it go down, but if they did, they didn't do anything about it. Also, the men were not interested in anything else, not even my purse or iPhone, which I had in view in my purse... they just wanted the pills.

But I don't know what to do, this isn't the kind of thing you can report to the fucking police.

I told my friend who I was selling for, and he can be incredibly intimidating, so I was afraid he'd not believe me and take it out on me that I'd been held up for his product. Instead, he wants to go downtown with me tomorrow, have me identify the bastards, and give them a piece of his mind. He's a very heavy dealer here with a good rep, and everyone knows he's someone you don't want to fuck with. At all. He's fully got my back on this and is so pissed that they pulled a knife on me and stole our product that he wants to pull a knife on them and demand either the product back or the money back.

The problem is, I don't want to be a part of that. Not really. That area is no one's turf, except for with meth, and guess who owns that turf for the meth? My guy, the same one who wants to get revenge for me.

I don't want any trouble, I want to stick to the areas and people I know and can trust — but at the same time, once we get established downtown, and everyone knows this petite, unthreatening girl is backed by the powerful (name omitted), I might be able to succeed.

I'd rather stay safe, but I also need this and have no other options. I feel like I'm fucked and forced into this whole mess I can't get out of. He also wants out of the game and is going to give me all of his contacts and connects so I can take over.

What the fuck do I do?

I can guarantee 100% accuracy to my account. This is a serious post, and please don't lecture me... I just really need help and advice, don't want to get into violence, and am scared shitless right now. I've been an active member on /r/opiates for about two years, but I change Reddit accounts a lot. You guys have always been supportive, and there's no one else I can talk to about this.

**tl;dr**: Was robbed of my friend's product today and am in way over my head dealing, my friend wants to get revenge, and I don't want to get involved with the violence — at the same time, I can't leave the game.",1411026931.0

I was an alcoholic for years until I hit rock bottom and needed help. I went to a dr and he gave me Antabuse and gabapentin, which worked like a miracle - the gabapentin helps really well with the DTs and the antabuse kept me from drinking (save a few relapses). 

Every day I take an antabuse with dinner. My wife knows this and supports me. Sometimes I forget and am gently reminded. So it's not a big thing and she's very happy with my ""sobriety"". 

But she doesn't know I'm fucking high all the time. And now I'm coming to the point where I can't keep spending money on oxys and vicodin - I'm up to $200 every couple three days and I've burned through my private savings. Our shared savings I haven't touched, but after next week I'm terrified that I will.

So I found out my Antabuse dr is one of those on the Subs web page ""find a subs dr near you"".

Does it work like Antabuse? Will it make it so I can't get high? Will it help with the jonesing?

anyway, i'm 23 years old and i was using for about 4/5 years. unfortunately somewhere along the line i contracted hep c. i found out in july. i didn't tell my family because my father had hep c and i knew my mother would be so upset. i just didn't know what to say. in my house, the girls share a bathroom upstairs and the boys share a bathroom downstairs. after finding out, i made sure to dispose of every single razor i used, didn't use the same box of floss as everyone else, and we obviously have our own toothbrushes so i only used mine.

my brother's in rehab and he called my mom last night to tell her he has hep c. she told me and i admitted to her that i did as well. she immediately started freaking out, bugging out and yelling about me not telling her.

first i thought it was because she was emotional and upset because 2 of her kids have hep c, but then she told me that she often accidentally uses my toothbrush because though they're different shades of green, they're both green.

she said that since we got these new toothbrushes (probably in like may or june), she estimates that she's accidentally grabbed and used my toothbrush maybe 20 or 30 times. she got really mad and upset and said that ""first [we, her kids] were killing [her] with the stress, now we're killing [her] with giving [her] diseases from [our] messed up life choices and drug addictions"". she was storming around the house for a good 20 minutes saying that now she needs to get tested for hep c and she probably has it. then she finally went to work and i haven't heard from her yet.

i understand why she is upset, and worried i guess. she is also a hypochondriac and always thinks she has cancer/is dying, so this was like the worst thing to possibly happen with her. -__-

i'm kinda stressed though because once in a blue moon, my gums do bleed while brushing my teeth. i think everyone in my family has that problem except my lil sis. i can't remember the last time it happened though, and obviously i always spit the blood out and clean and rinse the toothbrush. i've never seen any visible blood get on the toothbrush itself, it's usually just in my mouth and then i spit it out.

i would feel really bad if she got it from using my toothbrush especially because i have put her through so much stress during my using years. and she didn't really do any drugs in her life, just drinking, weed and a lil coke in her younger years, so it seems unfair that she could possibly get it from using her heroin addict daughter's toothbrush. i really hope she doesn't have it.

i didn't mean to keep it from my family, i just didn't know how to say it and didn't want her to get upset. and i didn't know my mom was using my toothbrush.

could she possibly have hep c from accidentally using my toothbrush? well i mean, i'm sure it is possible, but is it likely?",1411139202.0

I told all my people that they were to lie to me if I asked for stuff and they had it, and to not tell me if they got any. They are friends of mine in addition to dealing to me (they are my dealers first and my friends second, but they always support me when I need to take a break), and said they understand why I have to do this and that they are happy to help me. I made an exception for one guy, because my one friend will still want them while I am going without, and I want to be able to source for him in the mean time. I am going to have a couple of thirties on my birthday which is in the middle of the month, but other than that, nada. 

It's been, as I said, about a week. Today when I went to work I had a strange feeling. I had taken an epsom salt bath the previous night because it helps me a great deal with aches and pains and just feels so damn relaxing, so I was feeling better than I usually would at this stage of being clean, but I felt even extra good. Like I could function at my job almost as well as if I was using. I got through the whole day without hiding in the bathroom, crying, or taking extra breaks. When I got home, I felt another strange feeling. 

My husband came home (he is well aware of the situation and is one hundred percent supportive, he does not use but understands the reasons that I do) and I got super awkward and felt all nervous and butterfly-ee. Like when we first started dating. I realized that this is what I felt like when I first realized I was in love with him and acted like a love-sick teenager. We ended up having sex, and I actually had a real live orgasm. It wasn't a withdrawal orgasm, either. It was normally timed and didn't hurt afterward or make me jumpy.

Am I normalizing? Is this what sobriety feels like? I haven't been sober for this long, not voluntarily, in so long that it feels totally foreign to me. Being clean has never felt redeeming, or good, or normal, or rewarding in any way. It has only been terrible. I am not ready to give it up for good, but today was a magical day that I did not think was possible. 

Moral of the story (tl;dr?): Withdrawal symptoms abating, life feels almost normal again, and I had awesome, fulfilling sex with my husband for the first time in months. I guess I just wanted to share this with those of you who need something upbeat to help you get through withdrawal - it WILL get better, I promise! Also because I am so damned excited about the sex thing, if I'm honest. I'm giddy like a fucking child.",1411113104.0

Hey all,

I posted here a while back about taking my subutex, asking if anyone knew of a way to make it taste a bit better.

I'm still taking subutex, and it still tastes awful (no, I didn't just get used to it), but that's not why I'm posting. I actually just have a simple question that never occurred to me until now.

What happens if I just swallow the subutex like any other pill? I realize there's probably a difference in the bioavailability, but is it such a huge difference (between taking it sublingually or orally) that it's worth me suffering for ten minutes dissolving the tablets when I could just be swallowing them in under a minute instead?

I pondered just trying it to find out how well it works, but I don't want to waste a tablet by swallowing it, take another sublingually to make up for it, and then have to try and explain to my doctor why I'm a pill short.

I appreciate any input!

Addicted to Oxys for years, managed to quit on my own a few times (hah) but not permanently until I almost died and had my 'moment of clarity.' Still, I did it on my own with a seriously controlled taper and several OTC meds.

I landed on Tramadol a while later. It was prescribed as a safe, non-addictive pain medication that had mild opiate-like effects. 

Me being me, I started taking more and more of it - and it wasn't a controlled substance, so I was able to buy shit-tons of it online, legally. August 18th came around and it was put on the controlled substances list, so now I can't get it. I've been thinking of quitting, and have tried before, but 1) withdrawal was worse than from oxy (no, I'm not kidding), and 2) it was legal and available and thus easy to say 'fuck it' and keep using it.

The problem seems to be that it has opiate withdrawal aspects, yes, but also a host of...other issues. A lot like trying to stop taking Effexor - absolutely insane mood swings and fits of rage interspersed with crying, electric brain 'zaps' and vertigo, full-blown panic attacks, etc. in addition to the twitchy, itchy, insomnia and worst-flu-ever feeling of coming off opiates. 

I have a handful of Tramadol left (39 pills, 50MG each) - I was taking 16 of them per day (total 800mg) or more for about three years, but am now uncomfortably hovering between three and four pills, or 150-200mg. When I go to two, I get the withdrawal symptoms that make it hard to function as a wife, a parent, or an employee.

I have a handful of other drugs, some of which I hear may help me, but I'm not sure what to take, when, how much, etc. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Here's what I've got:

* Tramadol HCL 50mg - 39 tabs

* Benzodiazepine - listed simply as ""benzodiazepine"", this is from the vet, for a cat who passed away. The remainder of her medication is in pre-filled liquid doses, with a total of 3.75mg benzodiazepine spread over 13 syringes. The liquid is absorbed through mucus membranes, so it has to be absorbed through the gums (or at least, for her that was the delivery method).

* Vicodin - 1 tablet, 7.5mg hydrocodone & 375mg tylenol

* Carisoprodol (Soma) 350 mg -6 tabs

* Gabapentin 400 mg - 2 capsules

* Gabapentin 300 mg - 2 capsules

* Cyclobenzaprine 5 mg - 16 pills

* I also have some of what is supposedly Kratom (""Maeng Da"", 114 capsules supposedly containing .5g kratom each) from a friend - I've never tried it and am not sure if the source she got it from is reliable/if it's genuine

* Plus, of course metric tons of Immodium, advil, etc.

* Secondary to all of that, I have access to 30 10mg capsules of Dexedrine ER, 30 tabs phentermine, and 60 5mg tablets of Adderall. 

* A prescription for 150mg Effexor XR, and about 40 75mg effexor remaining from an old scrip.

I realize this is a bit like throwing the contents of a garbage can at someone and asking them to make a four star dinner out of it, but I'm hoping someone can help me cobble together the various shit I have into a way to get off the tramadol without too much disruption to the rest of my life. I'm looking forward to not being dependent on it just to feel normal - at this point, it doesn't give me a lift any more, I just take it to not withdraw from it. 

PS: Apologies if this is the wrong place, or the wrong way to go about asking for help...if it is, if anyone can point me to a different sub where I can ask for advice I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you :)",1411062658.0

This morning I asked my therapist to elaborate and here's what he told me. Apparently this only applies to people who have blue cross/ blue shield. So if you're paying out of pocket or have some other insurance provider this does not apply to you(although its possible that other insurance companies might decide to do the same).  But this also means its nation wide. It seems their reasoning is that they are concerned that people are getting subs and selling them instead of taking them.  If this sounds stupid/crazy to anyone know that I completely agree. Still not sure if they are going to be testing for only subs or if they are testing for other narcotics or the policy regarding said drug tests. 
Again I have not yet researched this as extensively as I would like as I am currently trying to make myself breakfast without setting my kitchen or myself on fire.

However I'm still a bit unsure of how much opana would be appropriate to take.  I'm not a frequent user.  I generally go on once a month little binges where I might take 30mgs of hydrocodone at night for like three days in a row and that gets me going pretty good.  My math came out to maybe railing an eighth of the pill.  I based this of the equianalgesic chart I found on Wikipedia equating 3.3mgs oxymorphone equalling about 7 times the strength of 10mgs hydrocodone.  So basically would an eighth be safe to sniff?  Sorry for noobery :/.  I just want to be safe.

Tl;DR:  Would it be safe for someone who infrequently uses hydrocodone to insuflate 1.2mgs of opana?  Thanks for the help!

I have been a member of this community for over 2 years, most with another account that was discovered by friends and family, for the last 5 months I have been inactive and away all together.  Upon returning a week or so ago I observed an overall change in posts, content of titles, content of comments and now for the second time today content of dope porn.  There was a time when Opiates spoke from the heart, the heart of a junkie which is a beautiful sinister place and a natural oxymoron.  There was a time when shared openly on the struggles that come with living to use, and we never feared the judgement of others.  Opiates has always been a fucked up family that always had your back with wisdom that can only come from another tortured souls experience.  I could be wrong and will defiantly give more time for observation but I feel like this community is a hollow shell in contrast to its past.  In the last 5 months everyone who used to make this community seemed to go inactive, Im speaking of the ones who had also been a part of the family for years and had a special place.  I noticed the separation start around the time we lost Pears.  It was a slow move but it was happening, with this catalyst i feel like the snowball really picked up speed and now after I went AWOL for 5 months i can see the fracture is no more and now we have a full break.  I guess this is how life goes, people change.  Its just sad to me because throughout my use my life had only two constants, change and the family of opiates.  This however is not a bad thing, its just different.  I have faith though that this family will come back with new additions and in turn be stronger, funnier more sinister and loving than ever before.

i know this is a question/topic that has been done to death. but im having a hard time with a specific answer for my situation.

i go to a methadone clinic and get tested once a month randomly. its unsupervised, so not much of an issue to bring in 'clean piss' if needed. but i have some question about that..

if i decide to freeze clean urine, will that have any effect on the quality of the urine? (will they be able to detect in any way, that it has been frozen or preserved? will the amount of residual methadone in the urine required to be tested for stay in tact?)

also, for anyone that has experience with this.. how did you bring the urine in? (in a condom etc. stored in a hand warmer for correct temperature?)

lastly, if i use a powdered fentanyl(ROA IV), how long till its no longer detected? (i know its usually 3-4 days max for single use, but im afraid that the methadone clinic runs a very advanced test. they seem to test for EVERYTHING, and in the smallest quantities, as well as any residuals in metabolistic(?) things lol. ive seen others test positive 10-12 days after a single day of use!)

any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated!",1411242254.0

Fake drugs..","In Canada we're having similar problems with Oxy I.R's.. We're getting fake tablets that are VERY well made.. The Oxy I.R 20mg one's..

They contain 20% heroin, 40 percent Fentanyl (usually a cheap analogue such as B-F or Acetyl) but on occasion contain Fentanyl Citrate.. We've seen MP-45 mixed in, SMALL amounts of morphine and the rest is crappy binders and fillers such as caffeine, Inositol and common binding agents.

We've seen Oxy 80's (CDN/80) in New Brunswick which contained ALL Fentanyl and binders and fillers.. SAME size, SAME color on the outside (you could even peel the coating off or put it in your mouth and wipe the rest off on something)

A few O.D's have occurred due to these.. I couldn't BELIEVE what was sent to me, and the quality of the counterfeit drugs!

out of 5 tested, ALL contained different amounts, some had 1mg of Fentanyl Citrate, some had 0.75mg's.. Some had 2 fucking milligrams! 3 contained Morphine (roughly a half grain) ..33 Mg's or so, and 1._ _ Mg's of Fentanyl..

Verrrry scary stuff, they're not properly blending it and there's obviously hot-spots when one pill contains less than a mg, and another (bought at the same time, from the same person) contained over 2mg's..

I've also heard through word of mouth (I can't confirm if this is true or not) that Hydromorph Contin and MS Contin beads were being made and contained a Fentanyl analogue and a small amount of the actual drug.. Meaning they're taking 2/3's out and replacing it with a type of Fentanyl.. How they would make beads, I'm not sure.. And obviously can't confirm this has any truth to it in the least.. It was just an alleged accusation from a friend who I know. (He's studying chemistry, so who knows if it's true or not) if so... this is terrifying.

Day 1: 4/1 @ 9 AM, another 4/1 @ 1 PM

Felt like shit in the morning, better by afternoon.

Day 2: 4/1 @ 1 PM

Felt decent this morning, but groggy. Better after taking half sub.

Day 3: No suboxone, but a 15 mg X 2 of hydocodone and 10 mg oxymorphone

Felt okay this morning, no tingly weird feeling I am used to with fent withdrawals. Mild psychological urge to use fentanyl but totally manageable with the hydrocodone and oxymorphone. Probably should cut down on both of those within a day or two.

Day 4: No suboxone, probably some hydrocodone later

Feel fine, maybe a bit groggy but no withdrawals. Feeling 80 cents on the dollar, which was way more than I bargained for.

---

General update: this suboxone is really great. I only used 1.5 8/2 strips but I think I may be ""done"" with the taper. Maybe the fentanyl dependency wasn't as bad as I thought, but it has now been 3+ days and I feel fine without the fentanyl. This is great.

---

I need to stop using fentanyl. I have been dependent on it before and the withdrawal was pretty bad. I was able to manage by taking copious amounts of loperamide, sleeping a lot, drinking a lot of water, and popping relatively small amounts of hydrocodone and oxycodone.

I stopped for about 3 weeks and things were great, so I thought, well shit I'll start again and this time control myself.

FYI, I've been taking a minimum of 500 mcg - 1 mg per day, probably more most days.

And you know how that went...

So, this time I invested in 5 suboxone strips and a few hydrodocodone as well as a large supply of xanax. I'm not a fan of xanax or downers in general but they are effective as sleeping aids. I can get more if necessary but I really don't want to. I think I might stop using opiates for a while, because these are the only drugs I've ever taken that I can't use responsibly. But fuck they are the best, aren't they?

Ideally, I'd like to quit cold turkey, but I don't think that will happen.

So I am wondering what experienced opiate users think of this plan.

8/2 Suboxone everyday from day 1 to day 3 after last F use (last 2 ONLY if DESPERATELY NEEDED)

Loperamide everyday from day 1 to day N after last F use

0.5 - 1 mg Xanax every night from night 1 to night 4 after last F use (after that, used only if DESPERATELY NEEDED)

10 mg hydrocodone as needed day 4 to day N after last F use (especially if I feel a strong craving for opiates, taken 5 mg or 10 mg at a time and no more than 30 mg per day)

FYI, I also have some Opana available but I don't feel like it will be helpful at all... it's too good and will probably trigger me to use a lot of it and then go straight back to F when it's gone.

Since I haven't been taking THAT much F (I mean, to me it's a lot, but I think there are bigger users out there) and it has only been about 1.5 months, I feel that I can be rid of it after maybe 7 days... and stop taking hydrocodones after maybe 11-13 days... without too much discomfort... I really don't want this time to be as bad as the last, and I think that I am catching this dependency/addiction at an earlier stage, but it is still a little scary. Plus, I really need to be in good shape for my job - where a lot is expected of me and where I really can't let these folks down... the problem is that my job has been a crutch for the use... I can afford it many times over right now, and I can swing it day-to-day, and most of the time I'm feeling pretty good. But I know this doesn't last forever and that it will catch up to me and bite me in the ass. And I know that sooner or later my employees will see me slipping up and it won't be good.

So I really appreciate any and all advice.

2h23se,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2h23se/surviving_a_heroin_overdose/,7,https://redd.it/2h23se,mikenney,surviving a heroin overdose,"i'm 22 years old, i started using heroin when i was 17 and have been clean September 9th 2013. which was the day i overdosed. i live in Bartlett Illinois which is a suburb of Chicago. i have horrible grammar skills and have never posted on Reddit before so bare with me.

okay so i woke up that Sunday morning in September to find out that my parents were at the Chicago bears game and wouldn't be home all day, now they know of my heroin addiction and at that point in my life i had very little freedom. i wasn't allowed to drive or even have money in my possession. I have been to 2 different impatient rehabs and countless other out patient rehabs with the intent of getting clean. So them going to the bears game and leaving me home alone was a huge deal. Being the addict that i am as soon as i had a tiny bit of freedom i took advantage decided i should go buy some heroin. So i stole 25$ out of my parents room and my brothers 2012 Hyundai Veloster and headed to 290 east. Otherwise known as heroin highway.

Now at this point in my life i wasn't using heroin every day i believe i was a solid 2 or 3 weeks clean at the time so i had no tolerance built up. I put 5 dollars in my brothers gas tank and was gonna spend the other 20 on 2 bags of dope. When i arrived to the spot off Pulaski i spotted the man i was looking for and like a drive through i just pulled up, gave him a 20 and he gave me the drugs, very nonchalant. Like any heroin addict will tell you once you have your dope, you don't wait to get home to use. No, you'll pull over to the side of the road and do it right then and there. which is what i did. I used needles when i used, so i pulled out my kit that i kept in a little zip lock bag, full of a spoon, needles, cotton swabs and a lighter. Now being some what conscious of the fact that i had no tolerance i decided to only do 3/4 of the bag for the first shot. I poured what i thought was 3/4 onto the spoon mixed it with some water and added a little bit of heat until there was no more powder and it was an all a gold looking liquid. I dropped in the little cotton swab and sucked everything i could into the syringe. i had the needle ready to go and now i just needed to find the vein. i usually could hit a vein in 2 or 3 tries with out tying off. But since i hadn't used in a couple weeks it wasn't able to hit the vein. So i took my seat belt and wrapped it around my bicep and my veins started bulging out of my arm. I found the vein and hit it first try. i pushed down on the lever and immediately felt the wild rush of heroin going all through out my body. i remember removing the seat belt from my bicep and starting to prepare for my next shot. and then just black... you know when people have near death experiences they say the see colors or have some what of a psychedelic experience. all i saw was black .

I started to coming to life in the ambulance not knowing what on earth was going on. they told me i had just over dosed on heroin and that they had gave me narcan, which is what they give people who over dose on opiates. Whats crazy is that apparently 3 thugs walking through the west side of Chicago some how saw some white kid in a nice new car slummed over in the driver seat with my car running and needles and heroin every where. And decided to call the ambulance, they did steal my phone and my wallet which had nothing in it lol, but that's besides the point. if they would have not called the ambulance i would have been dead for sure. Its crazy how things worked out but i guess it was just not my time to go. thanks for reading this, sorry if it was boring or something i kinda just wrote this for myself just to express it because i don't really talk about often. so thanks again for reading

I asked my dad about them and he said they were ""too good"" - everyone took them in the late 70s, they were everywhere and super cheap, and they made you feel amazing... the problem was they made you a full blown retard and lots of people died from driving on them or doing other stupid stuff. He said by the time they were scheduled in the early 80s they became next to impossible to find, even in NYC (and he was running with the finance/fashion crowd back then so I'm sure they would have had access.)

I wonder why they were so prevalent when Belfort was around (in the early 90s) - I assume these were conterfeits coming from Canada/Eastern Europe, but made with real methaqualone? 

Most recent Lude story in the US I could find was this one, which seems to have been a bunch of older (50+) nostalgiacs who employed a chemist to make them: http://nypost.com/2010/04/07/22-busted-for-operating-3-5m-quaaludes-ring/

Like, as far as brain chemicals go. If I'm not mistaken, dopamine is the main compound that the brain is compelled to release when under the influence of opiates, correct? So when one ceases the use of opiates, dopamine (along with other compound's) levels drop; this causes withdrawal.

So, in theory, could one substitute another dopamine agonist in the place of opiates to quell the symptoms of withdrawal? Like, say, amphetamines? Or even nicotine?

Please correct me if I'm completely off base here. I don't make it a point to study brain chemistry, and I'm new to opiates in general. I'm not even a habitual user. I was just written a script for 20x 5/325 Norcos to alleviate some moderate pain associated with a burn, and the highest dose I've taken is 20mg.

Also, a side question: I've got five pills left. What can I do to heighten the experience? I plan on waiting a week or two for whatever tolerance I have to go down. Anything else you fellas can suggest? I've tried white grapefruit juice and I noticed a slight increase at 10mg. How about smoking some weed? If yes, should I smoke an indica or a sativa?

2h6800,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2h6800/what_the_hell_happened_to_me/,24,https://redd.it/2h6800,VivaCocaina,What the HELL happened to me?,"I had an overdose experience with heroin and I'm still struggling to understand what exactly happened, as it wasn't like a typical overdose from what I understand. I got kinda carried away describing what happened in a way that you can understand the gravity of what happened, but who knows, maybe you'll enjoy it. If anyone has any knowledge/experience that could enlighten me as to what the fuck happened, I would appreciate hearing it. 

I overdosed on heroin alone at my house. I can't believe I woke up. I awoke hours later on the floor, every muscle in my body in intense pain. I couldn't even take a half-full breath because my breathing-muscles would scream and seize up, preventing from breathing for a few seconds. It was like my own body was suffocating me. 

Confused and in agony, I focused on keeping my entire body still in order to prevent any flares of pain in my muscles, and breathe very shallowly and slowly, in a way that allowed me to actually receive enough oxygen to gradually pass out again.

When I awoke again, my body still screamed in protest to even the slightest movement, but my mind was a bit less foggy. I assessed the situation, and decided to I should try to get off the floor. I slowly dragged myself upright and then into a standing position, using my bed as a crutch. I had fallen out briefly before, but had awoke minutes later and just vomited a lot. I wasn't sure why I was in such pain, but I decided maybe some ibuprofen / aspirin would help. I didn't want to see my parents, but I had to curb the pain, and figured I would just tell them I had a head ache and take the pills then go back to my room to lay down. One careful, painful step at a time, I drudged to the kitchen and took some ibuprofen. My mom heard me and came to say good morning.

The look of horror on her face surprised me. Surely I just looked tired, maybe a little sick? How would she know what I was feeling? She began to ask me something.

That was a when I discovered I hadn't even noticed the worst part; I was 100% deaf. Literally not even 1% of my hearing was functional. Suddenly, I was terrified. Had I permanently destroyed my ears? 

I mimed that I couldn't hear her, and she covered her mouth, eyes wide with fear. She ushered me to the bathroom, and pointed at the mirror. I looked, and saw a monster staring back at me. One side of my face was swollen beyond recognition, and skin around my cheekbone appeared to have been scraped off. HOLY SHIT was all I could think. Did I get jumped last night?? What the FUCK is going on?? My mind raced as I struggled to remember the night, but only remembered scoring the drugs and shooting up. Then just black.

My mom was frantically saying something, but I couldn't hear. I mimed for her to write it down, and in response she scribbled ""I'm taking you to the doctor right now. What happened to you??"" Reluctantly, I acquiesced and nodded in agreement, grudgingly accepting that this situation was probably severe enough to warrant medical attention. I took the pen and wrote down the first thing that came to my mind. ""I got in a fight."" 

A sick feeling of regret was beginning to fill my belly as we drove to a ""doc-in-a-box"" care center. My mom wanted to come in with me since I couldn't hear, but I insisted she wait outside, because I figured telling the doctor the truth was important right now, and my mother knew nothing of my drug use. 

I struggled to communicate with the doctor, but told him what happened, probably with a voice not unlike Hellen Keller's. He offered no useful information, basically saying I'm lucky to be alive and to stop doing drugs. He had no explanation for my aching body and complete deafness. He suggested I rest and go to the hospital if things got worse. 

The saddest part was the first thing I did when I got home was shoot up. Less this time, but enough to curb the sickness and pain, and allow me to rest peacefully. 

Fortunately, over the course of the next 24 hours I regained my hearing and I could breathe without struggling, albeit painfully. A week later my muscles were still a bit sore, but nothing debilitating. The swelling had gone down a lot, but to this day one cheekbone is ever so slightly over-pronounced. 

After talking to the guy I bought it from, he told me it had fentanyl in it. I'm guessing that probably had something to do with it. After researching heroin ODs, I'm guessing that I overdosed and had some sort of seizure. My mom said she thought she heard inhuman noises coming from my room, but figured it was a movie or something. 

Can anyone explain to me why I was deaf, and why everything in my body hurt so bad? Normally when I do too much dope I puke. When I did way too fat of a shot, I went unconscious for a couple minutes then puked for hours. But this time, I didn't see puke anywhere on my clothes, floor, etc. How?? 

I haven't done H in 5 weeks now but I'm still wondering what exactly happened.",1411425788.0

Edit: my wds lasted about 2 months give or take some days. I had a moment where I went to ER for back pain due to the wds where I got Percocet. It's been 2 months since that last take, but the process took about 4 months to get to the point of no physical or psychological symptoms. The physical took about 4 weeks with some days being worse than others. Once that was gone, about 3 more weeks for the mental game to calm. I didn't even realize it when everything was straight. I kept my mind soo busy on purpose. AA meetings helped bc liked the chips. I'm actually a Medic, active duty, and this ordeal was my way of showing.myself I love emergency medicine than the drugs. It was very hard to least, and anyone going thru it, don't quit, it will end.

I went to a detox like, 15 minutes from my house and I was given what I think is a fairly normal protocol of meds. suboxone ( 8 mgs day 1, 4 mgs day 2 and 3, then weened off) as well as valium, muscle relaxers, stool softeners, etc. Anyways, i got home and was already feelin fairly shitty from the sub withdrawals and was OBSESSING over getting high. My only connect couldn't be contacted luckily, and I eventually made the decision last night to go on suboxone maintenance.

I am aware there is a subreddit for opiate recovery but i don't feel this is a recovery post, cause I have had time prior in both AA and NA and I am among the people who don't really feel subs are honest clean time, but to each their own. With that said, i do plan on still going to mtgs and being honest about it but I am going to just stay connected to sober people and keep up my regiment of making meetings weekly. I just won't be counting days while going.

So I met w the doctor today.. She said 350 for the initial consultation (ending up paying 300 instead) and 150 for each additional follow up visit. From what Ive found thats pretty average for prices I have seen people list in this and other forums. I was prescribed 8 mgs a day. I got the strips, and payed a little extra money too (50 bucks w insurance and a coupon for two weeks worth) cause i didn't want the horrid pills.I took a full 8 tonight, and for the rest..I was told to cut it in half and take 4 mgs in the am, and the other 4 mgs 12 hours after. I feel this dose is a lil high, but I have heard of people doing double n triple so i don't know??? I was honest w my using history and ultimately, i decided to go on short term maintenance mostly to curb the insane cravings I have had. I am basically a binge user. I will go on two or three week benders where I do as much as humanly possible and I realized how reckless  was getting. 

Im not thrilled I'm on subs..but I'm not gonna lie, the idea of having a somewhat normal life for a few months is so relieving. I can finally go back to the gym after three months of eating like shit and being lazy, wake up and not be sick, take my dog to the dog park and actually be social instead of having mega anxiety and isolating, etc. I guess I am just wondering if anyone is in a similar situation or has any advice for me since I don't wanna be on subs forever??

ALSO!! While in detox..i didn't shit for 6 days and I was incredibly uncomfortable..any advice for future constipation from the subs?",1411610755.0

Does anyone else have ideas of what other redditors in this sub look like? I've actually formed faces and caricatures of what certain people look like that are very active or that respond to my posts/comments. I don't know, maybe I'm just weird.

It's another RC but it's so much more powerful than etiz (I have a big benzo tolerance due to being prescribed them and buying them illegally on the street).

It's a really awesome combo in my experience but also a dangerous one if you don't have a high tolerance. It has a monster half life as wel as taking about 2 hours to reach it's peak (which lasts for ages). I took 16mg this morning and had a shot, nothing special. I did a shot later on at about 8pm and thought I'd be cool to drive to the local shop... NOPE, I passed out with the keys in the ignition and the engine on.

I'll start down a path and get deep into these lives like they were mine, and start yearning for days  50 years before I was born. I barely think about my own past, and regrets.

Had to, got into legal issues, died 3 times and was spending $1200 a week. Just got outta hand. So after I got outta jail I checked myself into rehab and completed the program. So I was on my way home from an NA meeting and when I'm walking a look down and see it. I spotted a wax baggy with an infinity symbol on it. I pick it up and realize its not one bag, it's a bundle. 14 bags of heroin for free. I'll tell you what I had every plan of using it when I got home, but I walked through the door and was greeted by my mom. She asked where I was and I told her I was at the church for an NA meeting. Then she started to tell me how proud she was off me and said she loved me. Then I realized I didn't want this for myself, I've come so far. So I ended up selling the 14 bag bundle to an old friend. Made a $90 come up and felt good about it. 

Just thought I'd share and tell people, addiction is never cured. It's only being treated, recovery never ends.

2hiwri,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2hiwri/dxm_has_almost_completely_eliminated_my/,18,https://redd.it/2hiwri,Fox_Spender,"DXM has almost completely eliminated my withdrawal symptoms, could be helpful to others.","So some background first, I've been using heroin (always insufflated) on and off for almost 9 years, this last 2 years being the heaviest period of use. This past year I've also  been taking Suboxone almost daily, anywhere from 1-8mg depending on how much I had and how recently I did/planned on doing heroin.

The past 3 months I've gotten down to 1-4mg of buprenorphine a day and I would do that for 12 days straight then I'd use heroin for 2-3 days (5-10 bags a day) and then I'd go back on the sub. Maybe once every 2 weeks I would have one day where I wouldn't take anything, usually the day before I planned on doing dope again,

Now I know I am fully dependent on buprenorphine, I've been taking it too long. My WD symptoms usually set in right around 24 hrs after my last dose, and by 36 hrs I'm in hell, lethargy, muscle weakness, back pain, irritability, cramps, headache, nausea, restless legs, insomnia, the whole 9 yards. 

So 3 days ago the inevitable finally caught up, I did my last 1mg of bupe and I am out of money until next week so I am left to suck it up and deal with it. So at around hour 48 I realized I couldn't go to work in such pain, I have a very physical job, and so after searching the house the only thing I could find were some DXM capsules. I remembered reading somewhere that some people have had success using dxm to alleviate some opiate withdrawal symptoms so I figured I had nothing to lose and I took 60mg and within 90 minutes all discomfort, pain, and even depression, was gone.  I was amazed, I swear I even felt slightly euphoric for some time, it felt like I had just taken 2mg of bupe or something, which was probably just from being so glad that I had found some form of relief, and quite an effective one at that.

So that got me curious and I looked into it and dxm is an interesting chemical, its the ""dextrorotatory enantiomer of levomethorphan"" which is an opioid analgesic, and dxm has some activity on the k-opioid receptors, similar to loperamide. Dxm is also an 'Uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist', which is a system that plays a role in opioid tolerance and withdrawal. And dxm has successfully alleviated opioid withdrawal symptoms in rats. I don't pretend to understand the mechanisms at work here but from what I've read there is sufficient evidence, both scientific and anecdotal, that dxm does is fact help with alleviating opioid withdrawal symptoms. 

I'm currently in the third day of withdrawal, and after taking 40mg of dxm this morning I feel relief again, normally my back would be absolutely killing me right now and I'd be sick as a dog, but I feel almost totally normal. I've also supplemented the dxm with some ibuprofen and cannabis and I really am shocked at how well I am faring right now, I've never had this kind of success from cannabis and ibuprofen alone. Actually nothing has ever helped my symptoms as much as this before, except for maybe Methoxetamine, which curiously is also an NMDA receptor antagonist.

Does anybody here have any personal experience with using dxm for this purpose, or other purposes, like potentiation, or to prevent tolerance?",1411737477.0

**The Fourth Step - Fearing Our Feelings**



**Page 279**


*""We may fear that being in touch with our feelings will trigger an overwhelming chain reaction of pain and panic.""*



**Basic Text, p.30**

A common complaint about the Fourth Step is that it makes us painfully conscious of our defects of character. We may be tempted to falter in our program of recovery. Through surrender and acceptance, we can find the resources we need to keep working the steps. 

It's not the awareness of our defects that causes the most agony-it's the defects themselves. When we were using, all we felt was the drugs; we could ignore the suffering our defects were causing us. Now that the drugs are gone, we feel that pain. Refusing to acknowledge the source of our anguish doesn't make it go away; denial protects the pain and makes it stronger. The Twelve Steps help us deal with the misery caused by our defects by dealing directly with the defects themselves. 

If we hurt from the pain of our defects, we can remind ourselves of the nightmare of addiction, a nightmare from which we've now awakened. We can recall the hope for release the Second Step gave us. We can again turn our will and our lives over, through the Third Step, to the care of the God of our understanding. Our Higher Power cares for us by giving us the help we need to work the rest of the Twelve Steps. We don't have to fear our feelings. Just for today, we can continue in our recovery. 


**Just for Today:** I won't be afraid of my feelings. With the help of my Higher Power, I'll continue in my recovery.

Been on sub maintenance year. Having thoughts of trying chipping. Worth it?,"Hey guys. I am 20 years old, got a job, going to transfer to a good school next Spring. I was never really too far into the path of a heroin addict, and only used for about 10-12 months during my run...  I went straight from oxycodone to heroin. I wanted Heroin and wasn't afraid of the stigma. It's cheaper and stronger, why not? Fuck the roxys if people are going to be 30 or more for one. It started in college when I became extremely depressed and my social anxiety skyrocketed. Basically self-medicating, while also feeling complete bliss.... I never ever injected myself though.

I have done many, many drugs... ranging from weed to ecstasy, psychedelics to dissociatives... benzos to opiates... stims to coke... you get the idea... a lot of this had put a toll on my mental health, and as a person who was predispositioned to social anxiety/depression it made it worse when I used a plethora of drugs in college. Not only that, but I started gambling playing blackjack online and won HUGE amounts, I'm talking 10 grand, 35 grand at one point from 1000 and losing it all. I know that it wasn't money I earned, and I lost a couple thousand in retrospect. But man I didn't know when to stop when I was ahead. I always wanted more. After getting some help from people, I've laughed it off though and haven't gambled in a while and don't plan to soon.

Now, I am doing so much better. I take Suboxone strips daily, and don't plan on quiting anytime soon. Some people think sub maintenance is bad, and that to fully recover you need to abstain from everything. Well, I don't agree with that. If it weren't for the suboxone I'd be back on dope again and again I guarantee it. I don't take too much, only one or two 2mg strips a day. It used to give me a nice feeling, but now it just keeps me from relapsing. Also I take 10mg valium as prescribed, but I only take this 1-4 times a week. I haven't really had any issues with benzo withdrawal yet and I don't plan to. 

However, I still miss heroin. Out of all the drugs, even though I was heavily into marijuana and rave drugs back then, opiates was my true love (HAAA GAYYY)... but they were. I don't know why but they just make me feel sooooo good. It's like taking a mental vacation. I am sure you all can relate. 

A lot of the drugs I take are for my depression, but more importantly, my Social Anxiety. H was the key to this... and Benzos help...but H is uncomparable, plus it's just a vacation like I said haha..



I am starting to earn a decent paycheck already and have almost a thousand dollars saved. I work part time at a restaurant. Starting to become independent. Some things that interest me are drugs lol... but I am a recovering addict. I don't think I have to be strictly sober however. I can drink sometimes and not turn into an alcoholic (I despise alcohol tbh but only do it for the liquid courage), and I am not that into MDMA and psychedelics anymore. I've kind of grown out of my rave phase, I will still probably attend concerts and such but it ain't no thing anymore for me to get fucked up on a shitload of drugs like these new kids are doing. I do love the music though. Also I'm not a heavy weed user (I used to be heavy pothead but not anymore... I smoke very seldomly since it gives me anxiety in the wrong settings now)

So lastly... what comes to mind is Heroin. I won't spend all my paycheck on it, but I think I can handle chipping since I am prescribed my suboxone strips. I am on a low dose too, so the tolerance won't be too big of an issue right? FYI to anyone wondering, suboxone is a very powerful opiate, but it is part agonist/antagonist so you can't get fucked on it. I think it's much better than methadone for recovery imo (although I never tried methadone). 

So what do you guys think? Sorry for writing so much, just wanted to share a lot about what's going on in my life. And I have been doing better, but I still have stressful days and chipping could be a nice vacation.. worth it? Or should I say fuck it and keep on being clean? Another thing is I don't value the amount of time spent sober as much as other people. In NA/AA people will say ""I'm X days clean"" but what does that *really* mean? Clean time don't mean shit if you aren't doing anything within that timeframe to improve yourself. Yes you are off the dope, and slowly adjusting back to reality but it doesn't mean anything if you don't make progress.

There's a mild opiate undercurrent that simply needs to be enhanced.  After some experimenting, here's what I've found makes it more opiate-like and less tweaky:

- Marijuana

- Benzos (etizolam specifically; low doses only)

Both of these take the nasty edge off while bringing out the opiate-like qualities.  The combo of all three feels like an all-day chill buzz with enough energy to be productive and lucid.  Throw in a tiny amount of 2-FA and it gets even better.  (Stims lower the seizure threshold but benzos raise it so I've never had any problems).

Does anyone know anything about this? Is it just hocus pocus nonsense?  Or is this some new thing I've just never heard of before?

I've never had a problem chewing (although usually I just cheek them and let them do their thing, works longer), but recently I got some mylan 75mcgs that seem to stop working the second I chew them.  Other patches when chewed the hard plastic the adhesive is stuck to comes apart quite easily but these it stays together and becomes very pliable.

edit: Bonus question:  What is the lifespan of an opened patch and what is the best way to keep them longer? I usually try to keep the original plastic covers they come with and put them between those when storing, but I've heard fridge is a good place I'm just worried about moisture(ziplock maybe?).

I really tried to recover my old username, I tried looking for one of the 2 posts i did a while ago but unfortunately one was made while I was totally empty, tortured by withdrawal, the other one at times of the exact opposite.. wheat I mean is both times, my brains where not at a high time of working efficiency..
so this is my new account, i swear to take more care of it this time...:D

that being said.. 

I recently got my shit together and finally ordered a pack of 5 wheel filters (2nm, 25mm, PVDF) together with 10x10ml syringes from, it couldn't be any easier, AMAZON.. all together 25 bucks or so.. totally worth it..

that whole thing started as a harm reduction measure only., I just didn't want continue to shoot all those shitty filler and binders up my veins and even tho I really put a lot of effort into prep of my shots, cleaning the solution as good as possible with cottons, doing 3 rounds of filtering I'm sure there is still lot's of tiny things left that barely visible in a rig still accumulate in my body over the course of time..  
so I wanted that out.. 

wheel filters do that very effectively.. 
so I took 15 of the Mallie 30's Oxy, grinded them up and soaked them in  13 ml water (I use smart water since its distilled; better would be that kind of water sold for injections , but whatever ) which I boiled and cooled down beforehand...

after 20min. soaking time :D (no idea how long it takes until all the oxy is actually dissolved into the water, probably it's way shorter, but it just feels better to let it sit for a while) take 1 clean 10ml rig and draw all the solution up through a regular piece of cotton, like one would do preparing a shot.
Repeat that process one more time.
Reason why I filter with cotton first is to avoid clogging up the wheel filter with all the stuff that a cotton would get out anyway. 

then, with the wheel filter attached to the tip of the syringe and a needle attached at the end of the wheel filter, inject the solution in a sterile glass container/bottle whatever works..
then I drew up 2ml of a premium brand vodka to flush the filter, also injecting it into the bottle together with the rest of the oxy solution.. 
 after that, pushing air through the filter helps emptying it of all valuable remains :D 

reason I flush the filter with vodka is I don't have bacteriostatic water at hand and vodka, especially premium kind is pretty much clean alkohol and diluted enough has been proven safe to inject.

so, that whole process gives me 15ml of clean, safe to inject Oxycodone solution, 1ml containing 30mg 

now we get to the fun part.. who would have though having a bottle of IV solution at hand is soo fucking awesome!!
 no annoying prepping anymore.. 
In the morning, when thing can't go fast enough..,  how many times have I spilled stuff because i was sick and rushing and.... fuck

but even more helpful.. at work!!
I keep my bottle at home in the fridge to constantly keep the solution cold, so for work, before I leave, I conveniently draw up 3 shots, put them in the little case I made, and take them to work..
no more taking a bag of stuff on the toilet and then disappearing for 15 minutes.. 
30 sec and I can be done.. 

It is just soo convenient.. I will never go back to not use wheel filters.

I really really recommend all other fellow IV pill users to do so too...  
your bodies will thank you..

soo.. hope that post is understandable and not too confusing.. sorry but english is not my native language.. 

have a great day..

I'm using a throwaway for this post, just feel like I need to get this off my chest.....

I started off as a 'chipper' and thought that I could control it, you know how that happened, I started using more and more until I was a daily user 0.5 gram a day but then I binged last week. I don't know what came over me...

I had just quit my job since I am starting a new one in 2 weeks time so I thought that I would 'treat myself' since I had just got paid so $1500ish, I bought a gram and got though it within a couple of hours, I was the highest that I had ever been but I wanted more... headed out to grab another gram and also some meth, got wired on meth for the next 4-6 hours then before I knew it, it was 6 AM, shit I hadn't slept and I look like shit.

Around 8 AM after forcing some food down my throat I started on the gram I bought, got though it by 1PM and yep... I wanted me dope, not having showered I headed out to buy another and some more meth, I also grabbed some xanax, by this point my pay check is seriously getting damaged and I haven't even paid any rent and bills...

over the next 2-3 days I just didn't care anymore, I was a zombie wired on meth and then getting high on dope and nodding off for a few hours then perking right back up with more meth.....

around day 5-6 I had blasted though my money, my personal hygiene had gone to shit, I haven't eaten fuck all in days, my skin and eyes looked like I had gone a few rounds with mike Tyson but i walked to that car and spent the last of it on dope, nodded out then after it had all gone I took a bar and slept for 14 hours, now I have fuck all money and probably going to get evicted unless I can pawn some shit (including this laptop).

2hmg0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2hmg0b/an_opiate_manifesto_very_long_post/,36,https://redd.it/2hmg0b,caribbeanfool,an opiate manifesto... (very long post),"The Opiate Manifesto

The more I've read, talked, listened, and interacted with other “heads” the more I've noticed a disturbing trend. The degree of self-shame apparent through everything I've experienced is ridiculous. Something so pure, enjoyable, and not subject to rules, regulations, traditions, etc. is turned into a sign of weakness, or termed a mistake. Simply using opiates of any kind (pills, powders, admixtures, etc.) for some reason lends itself to in-depth protestations of “It's all kinds of fun but all kinds of negative” sorts of rambling statements swearing you'd quit if you could, but you can’t so you won't. Where are the psychonauts? Where are the searchers? Where the fuck is the self-respect for taking on a real, live demon, and enjoying the ride regardless of cost or consequence?

A little background: I've been experimenting with hard core drug usage for almost 20 years. Knock on wood, I've never been arrested and I wake up from overdoses ready to remount and try again. Is there an element of obsessiveness in my quixotic quest for a few hours of easy like a Sunday morning? Absolutely. Is there danger? Maybe so, but danger makes life far more interesting than safety. If there wasn't a legitimate possibility of serious harm, why bother? At what price fame and glory? (I don't mean fame in the sense of being recognizable. If you passed me on the street you wouldn't recognize me if I gave you 20 guesses and most of the vowels.)

I realize the age bracket skews young in this game, and on reddit in general, but at the same time, posting a picture of a few 5/500's and a smiley face does not a psychonaut make. Many of you probably have very valid reasons for not pushing a little harder on the accelerator, and fear may be the most valid of all. That being true, why even start down this path if you are prepared to alter your process out of fear? I've never truly understood the attitude “This feels so good it must be wrong in some moral or ethical circumstance so I will pretend I don't like this as much as I really do.” I suppose if  you have some in-borne respect for legal codifications, you could interpret your usage through that context, but if that is the case, again, why bother in the first place?

Now, lest I sound cruel, I realize that there are probably more reasons to quit than to keep using. If you happen to be one of those who really wants out of the game but feel like your addiction is tying you to something you can't control, then all I can say is I hope for the best but brother, you have a hella fight on your hands. As I've never really felt like I was doing anything “wrong” by using, I can't really relate to wanting to quit. Years ago, I took HST's advice about rehab and told any friends or family that any attempt to hold an intervention or force me into rehab would be met with absolute asymmetrical warfare on my part; there have been no attempts nor do the people who know my outlook & habits even say a cross word to me about dope, usage, or philosophy behind same. That being said, it is a dangerous lifestyle and there is no guarantee that negative outcomes won't happen to me. However, if the worst happens, I will lay low for as long as it takes then jump right back in. For me, it isn't a question.

My most specific complaint comes from the verbiage that is used by both those using AND those quitting, Statements such as “god damn im high as fuck right now but fuck idk if it was worth it” (user LsWee_d) and “Found myself using six days this week (three points total), and I want out. “ (user Manwithgiantpenis). Next to phrasing usage as “poison in my veins” this kind of shit gets me fucking nuts. Can we at least agree not to suffer with addiction but at the very minimum, to glory in it? There is a suicide mission quality to life in general, that is NOT a function of drug use either generally or specifically. It falls into the same category as those people who say things like “I want to quit because I need to do something real/accomplish certain goals/be a better husband, father, brother, etc.” Honestly, I wish you all the best luck quitting because I can take a wild guess and say that your attitude toward drugs is not conducive to adopting the Farragut attitude of “Damn the torpedoes.” There really should be some kind of philosophical test procedure before anyone is allowed to play with toys that are too much for them to handle.

So, all this said and done... what's the upshot? The upshot is the idea that there really is something to explore in this game. You'll never find another situation offering up so much to explore, to feel, to experience both in terms of pleasure AND pain. Whatever part of the game you play, and whatever you have to do in order to play, there is so fucking much to find out about that even if you wash out and end up in rehab, you'd have to be blind not to see the real truth of the phrase “nothing ventured, nothing gained.” I can only speak for myself and the enjoyment, the true warmth of the moment, the nods, the smiles, the withdrawals (yes, there is something to be enjoyed in withdrawal as well as in getting high. Falls under the oscillation explanation for getting high in general. If anyone is curious I will explain the  oscillation hypothesis in the comments (assuming anyone actually read this far!!!) and every other part of the experience of struggling moment-to-moment to achieve the perfect high. 

One last thing: I realize there is some joy in having the ROA argument, but wouldn't you agree that the best solution is to change the reference point? Rather than IV or railing or swallowing or booting... how about IV AND railing AND swallowing AND booting. I mean, if you are planning an all out assault on your health and senses, seems like you attack with every weapon in the armory. Nobody chooses between attacking with the Navy or the Air Force or the Army. You attack with all three and tell your body to get down or lay down. But, maybe that's me. I'm a lil crazy like that, and truth be told, we don't always have enough to proceed down multiple paths. But when we do.....

To anyone who read this, enjoy your Saturday and I hope there is someone out there who can see it from my POV. Those real psychonauts out there; my hat's off to you. Someday I'll have to tell you the story of the missing week. Assuming of course I ever find it. Vaya con dios y'all.",1411833619.0

You were born human, and it's a condition we all fail at in the end. We're born die, and you finished your service time.","I just received a call from my friend Addron, telling me that one of his friends and blue connects was found dead this morning by his mother in bed. We don't know exactly what it was caused by, but we assume a combinations of Xanax and 30's. 

Now, I never knew Mit well. I met him a few times when I drove Jakeson to the town over where he'd pick up for me from Mit. Mit was your average completely lost millenial : Still living with mom past 25, very introverted and withdrawn, loved roleplaying games, MMORPG's, Magic, the whole lot. All things he used to try to find some feeling of accomplishment or pride in his life, much like I use video games, writing, and lifting. He was stuck in the cycle of SS paying more than he'd make at a real job, so he couldn't work a real job despite WANTING to contribute to society like so many others in his position. You know, those ""losers"" you always hear about on the news. Those ""worthless junkies who need to find a job"". You know, those statements you always hear from rich White Men who have never had to work for a single thing in their lives due to one wonderful world : Nepotism. Anyways, Mit's way of receiving accomplishments was through these games, and now...drugs. Why? Because eventually the games run out of excitement and difficulty. We CRAVE more difficult puzzles to solve. We CRAVE harder work to do once we've mastered something easier. But, where's the harder work for a 28 year old man on SS who lives with his mother? It doesn't exist. The system will have him in this same lifestyle until he does, like like they do millions of other great Americans. He would have drug himself through 40 more years of this bullshit existence.

As time goes on and on, day to day, these people end up being bored. They have zero form of REAL positive reinforcement in their lives, and zero way to receive REAL accomplishments that keep everyone else going day to day. So they turn to Opiates, mostly. There's no quicker sense of accomplishment than when that first sense of warmth hits your body. It feels exactly like when you aced that tough algebra 2 test in High School that you'd thought you'd bombed, maybe even better! What's this ""moon""? 15MG? Man, this feels as good as I did back in HS when our swimming program won state! And I didn't have to do anything to get the reward? I want to feel this all day. And he did, until he died. He wanted to feel worthwhile and accomplished so badly that it lead to himself killing himself on accident. Just so he could feel like he was someone worth something more than what he thought of himself.

These people are stuck in a broken system where they're rewarded themselves with fake dopamine for fake accomplishments. And It's all because they truly can't find real accomplishments to work towards, they have no real goals. And they can't have real goals, because that'd fuck with their SS. And you know damn well that SS barely covers necessities. All he ever wanted was to feel accomplished. Talented. Needed. Just like the other 6 billion of us.

Unfortunately it's always the drug that feels needed at the end that leads to a brother never feeling needed for anything ever again.

RIP MIT. I promise I will get myself out of my own situation, and I will take Jakeson and Addron with me. We're all gonna make it, brah. We will not let this system beat us, as we are millennials, and we must become America's greatest generation or die trying. Because they've forced us into that corner.",1411969245.0

I read a post over on the Keto reddit where a user said that two weeks on keto severely reduced the amount of alcohol they needed to get drunk.

I know from personal experience that everything is heightened on a fast because the stomach doesn't require near the amount of energy for digestion, the body isn't busy breaking down food into usable components and the negatives that come with eating our modern day foods aren't there.

Its a thought I've had and its not a magical cure all because I don't even know if it would work. I have read a study where fasting increased endogenous opiate production in the body so that it released the equivalent of 50mg of morphine daily, up from the usual 30mg (this was in longer fasts and it was questioned whether it was part of the addictiveness to fasting found in anorexics) so there might be a slight tolerance build-up.

I'm no scientist, but everything I've read about long-term fasts seems to indicate that there is a reversal in build-ups of all kind: arterial plaque, scar tissue, fat stores...and I've been thinking wouldn't this also apply to drug tolerance?

I wasn't totally comfortable with this but I got introduced to this guy through a friend so I tried to just be chill about it. He then proceeds to put the stamps onto the scale themselves and when it hits 2.17 he goes yup there that's a gram.  9 bags, for 150 dollars ~_~

When I emptied everything out I got warned by the guy that he had narcan and such and that doing 5 would be A LOT (I usually do 10 but because my regular guys stuff sucks usually). He's also claimed 60-70% purity and that his regular stuff is 90%+

I swear there could not have been more than 0.5gs since I did a tester of 3.5 bags and felt nothing at all. Then did a 5.5 bag and felt a barely there rush. So much for 150 (he actually said 180 - 20 dollars a bag but my friend was covering the difference since he told me 150 earlier).

So, how much does an empty stamp weigh? enough that 2.17 minus that weight times 9 would be correct? The bags were pretty full, usually between 25%-50% of the first fold covered, more often close to 40-50%.

Is this connect good possibly? I feel like I could get him to weigh it out next time and he said he would actually go out of his way to get my non stamped stuff and through it all together in a little baggie or something if I want. 150-180 for a gram sounds like heaven if I can get him to actually do this but if these 9 bags actually WERE a gram then the dope is just too weak for this to be a deal. My guess is having shot 8 of these would have done the trick but its hard to really say. I was going to get another 7 next week and give it another shot since that's when his good shit is gonna be in, but I dunno.

I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and all of a sudden my whole entire life makes sense.

I could go on forever about this, how it's opened my eyes and helped me, yada yada, but whats interesting is now I think I understand my love of opiates a lot better.

Heroin is the only thing that brings me into the middle. I can get out of bed BUT at the same time I'm not drowning in energy and misery and excitement all at once. I can stand to be awake and alone and alive.

It makes sense to me now why I don't like cocaine very much and I hate doing meth by itself (meth+heroin all day erry day tho!). And why weed freaks me out. I still enjoy getting stoned but it takes me to a very weird place and it's taken me many years to not have a mental breakdown or panic attack when high (which goes to show how desperate I was to get out of my own head in high school lol).

Mentally IM DONE, over it and want my money back. but i work 2 full time jobs and have used up all of my time off with my last few attempts at going cold turkey. So taking a week or so off just isn't in the cards. 

EDIT 10-1-14: Well.. They have two programs. One is in-patient. One is out-patient. The in-patient is pretty much out for me due to cost. The in-patient is 2 weeks of 6 days a week. Go in from 8am to 3Pm everyday and get treated. But there's a co-pay everyday. Plus I also wouldn't be able to work so that poses a problem for me. It's doable but I think i'm just gonna have to man up and do this at home. i know that's not the smartest way to do it, but I can't take 2 weeks out after just taking two weeks a month and a half ago. 
I'm going to have to take a few days out and do this myself at home. I'm going to get some Xanax to put me to sleep for the first few days. 

Thanks for all the help guys",1412012805.0

I have a few chronic pain conditions that started about 2.5 years ago. I've been on norco 5/325, norco 10/325 on and off for these pain issues.  Never for more than a few weeks at a time, with short breaks. When the pain is at bay, I do enjoy the euphoric feel of the medication, so I tend to take it until it's gone and then have a short break.

I have an additional pain issue that requires the occasional percocet 10/325.  I can't honestly tell the difference. Maybe it seemed stronger at the onset, not sure. I  have been on that on and off a year.  

Fast forward to today.  I just had dental surgery.  I was given norco 7.5/325. Honestly, if feel no euphoric effects at all. It may as well be asprin.  Which is fine, since it handles the pain (or, maybe the high dosage of ibuprofen is handling that).

Regarding tolerance:  Obviously I have built it up.  At some point, it would be nice to revisit that good feeling - but perhaps once you hit a point, there is no return?  

Since I do not take super high doses and it's only been a couple of years on and off, is there a time period I can lay off of it and return to how it used to be, or are you pretty much done once you get to a level of tolerance? I have not and will not increase over the recommended dosage or use CWE or anything, it was just a nice side benefit.  I am willing to hold off on my pain meds and stick to over the counter for months or a year if it's possible to return to normal, but if not, I will just take them as directed. They do help with the pain, I just miss the added benefit.

Thank you all.

It's been three years since I've IVd, back then I bruised VERY badly (like half of my forearm after 1 hit), but I had thought that was from reused needles/bad technique.
This time, I've gotten better technique, new needles every time, but I'm still bruising easily. 

Also, there are a couple of small, hard, sore lumps at a few injection sites, what would that be? ",1412008280.0
