In the ether of his room, we went back in time to when punk turned into grunge. He was the same kid who had run away from home at 14 in black combat boots and the denim jacket with spikes and sleeves cut off. Even though he was 33 now, he saw himself the way he was in 1991. All that he could see he stole. Cody filled up his garage-like room with useless electronics and other things he scavenged from doorsteps around the city. He squawked every word he spoke and had purple track marks that ran up and down his arms and neck like the stitched seems of a stuffed drawstring doll. His wood-glued Mohawk fit perfectly with the chain from his septum to his earlobe, and pinprick pupils revealed his ravaged soul. Preoccupation with heroin eclipsed everything else. He didn‚Äôt seem to notice his teeth were gone or that the last 15 years had passed. I was 19, and I wanted to be just like him.

We sniffled. We yawned. We ached until we fixed up. Then we bombed down hills at night on our skateboards. The shiny hood ornaments of vandalized cars jangled on the chains hanging from our waists. We howled and barked like dogs at the people walking by and tore through traffic on wet streets in the fog. Falling meant dying, and we pushed it harder every chance we got. We hung off the back bumpers of trucks heading up the hills like skiers on a lift and ripped back down the pavement.

Sometimes we sat on on a bench at midnight so he could play guitar and let his voice echo in the empty dark between buildings. Zombie crack heads laughed at his singing and the sight of us. We were invincible and intimidating as Vikings all night long but when the sun came up, we came down. Then, our backs hurt and we rode the ferry to work, where we groaned through painful labor regretting every moment of the night before. In the evening, we rode back to the city with runny noses. We got our fix and did it all over again.

The city was my mother, and I was her child, an infant formed in the rancid womb of the whore and birthed into heartlessness. She had no milk for me to drink. She had no love to give because cold concrete and sidewalks cannot nurture you. They can only make you hard.",1533877374.0

My stepfather was an addict for 5 years, he went to prison for about 2 years for robbing a pharmacy for Vicodin and Oxy but when he came out, he was ready to take on life and was excited to see all his kids and was just thankful he was given another opportunity in life. 

Fast forward 2 months later and my mother breaks the news to me and my 3 other siblings that he OD‚Äôd alone in his apartment room on heroin. He never showed up for work which was unlike him so his boss went to check on him the next day and found him blue and stiff.

I was the only one that didn‚Äôt cry, he abused me when I was way younger so I had a resentment towards him, I never wished death upon him though. 

Everyone thought it was so strange I didn‚Äôt react to the news, not even at his funeral , I just kind of acknowledged it and comforted my siblings. 
I always pushed it to the back of my head and never thought about it but lately I‚Äôve been thinking about him because my addiction is close to rock bottom and I literally imagined him dead and almost started crying and got weird and emotional. 

He was fresh out so his tolerance was non exsistent so it wasn‚Äôt intentional, he probably just drew up however much he use to do before he did time.

Did it hurt when he OD‚Äôd? Do you think he knew he was OD‚Äôing or just nodded off and died?
It‚Äôs important for me to know this. Thank you so much , no assholes pls

RIP Ross Matthew Goben , you were an ass but you taught me how to be a good man, the man I am today.

Oi mate. I just read your response to my past in your thread. I'm doing my best to stay off the pills, so I'm drinking. Got to have a vice right? Better the lesser of two evils. 

I just felt I had to get this off my chest and tell my story. I never touched drugs until I dropped out of high school and fell in with a bad crew. Fast forward and the I have tried a bunch of drugs and my mother has become disabled with multiple sclerosis. My fathers health is failing because of a car accident when he was 18. I finally am clean and have my son with the women I intend to marry and shit falls apart. Next thing I know my son is taken from me at just 1 and a couple months. My ex claims I molested him and next thing I know I'm facing prison time. This is the point where I just break.

That night after interviewing with the police(bad idea I didn't have run ins growing up.) I get smashed and pop something like 10mg dillies with no real tolerence. From that point on I spend the last 2 years living at home just completly broken stealing my mom's dillies that she needs for pain. I eventually graduate to stealing her 10mg pills.

All this to basically say that the day I lost my son my heart broke. Something in me died that I won't ever get back. My life's coming together now, I escaped the false charges as the police violated my charter rights to having a lawyer present and I'm starting a career. I've got a wonderful women in my life who sees the boy behind the man who's been hurt.

Still struggling and  bidding my time to go for custody if my son. But man I never knew pain until I lost him... Now he's 3 and fuck I just ealized he's half way or so to 4.

Thanks for listening, Mate. I appreciate it.",1533871390.0

Question. I took my normal fun dose at 3 o'clock orally...(I ate the fuckers, lol..).then i mowed the yard real quick waiting for it to kick in. When I came in, I was parched so I slammed a glass of ice tea and it made me nauseous and I ended up puking a little bit, not  a ton.... I didn't see any pills in my puke, nor was it at all pink (k56's)  but wondering if I lost any oxy in the puking ...it was about 80 minutes after taking them. I don't wanna take more just yet if the loss was minimal...but wondering if there's any rule of thumb like, if you puke in first two hours you're losing oxy, vs it's digested already, etc... obviously I'll wait another hour and gauge it but curious of anyone has any ideas if they think I've tampered my buzz potentially...TIA!

First time- I forgot a portable speaker in my car.... I‚Äôm a forgetful motherfucker so part of me thought my dumbass just lost it or forgot it somewhere

Second time- I got a new portable speaker.....and forgot it in my fucking car again (did I mention I‚Äôm a forgetful motherfucker)

Last night- my brother was staying at my house and here in Hawaii we take our shoes off before we enter a house and my brothers shoes were stolen off the front porch....

I‚Äôve looked into booby traps and apparently they‚Äôre illegal in all states. I‚Äôve been trying to think of a way to make an ‚Äúart project‚Äù or something and just leaving it in my car that would severely fuck someone up if they sat on it or put their hand/knee on it while going through my car....

Calling the cops here is an option but 100% I know that they won‚Äôt be able to do shit about it. 
Even if I bought a camera to put outside...around these parts they could probably smile and wave at the camera and I know nothing would happen. 

Some of you I know are saying ‚Äújust stop leaving stuff outside‚Äù which I have....after the second time my speaker was stolen and I realized for sure that I wasn‚Äôt just losing them. That they were stolen from my fucking car. But my brothers fucking shoes? Like what the fuck? We aren‚Äôt rich people living in a poor neighborhood. My car is an absolute shit box and not even all of the windows roll up on it. I live in a tiny little house in the back of a larger house. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre some flashy people living in the hood....

I‚Äôm kinda pissed and I kinda want someone to get fucked up for this. 

What could I do to deter people from going through my shit and stealing fucking SLIPPERS from my fucking porch? From now on I‚Äôll just have to move everything inside. Even my fucking shoes apparently. But like I said, this is the third time and I feel like it‚Äôs the same people and I want to do something that will fuck them up and make them stop stealing my shit.

It was less than .1 worth, but after hitting it the only effects (aside from a very small rush) were a slightly elevated heart rate for about 10 minutes, some pretty bad unsteadiness and uncoordination (walking and fine motor) and some super fucking severe vision problems. Shakiness, blurriness, inability to focus. I was seriously mostly blind for about thirty minutes because I couldn't control where my eyes focused, if they focused.

That shit lasted about 30 minutes and I have some teeth grinding, and - honestly - I think my heart rate is actually slower than usual. *(I just took my pulse; my normal is 75-80; right now it was around 60... So, yeah, slower than normal heart rate, but from what I can tell its steady, not skipping beats or screwing around like it did the last times I made the dumbfuck choice to shoot crystal)*

This is the same shit I did earlier (11 pm last night) in a goofball with no ill effects, just the normal effects I was looking for. As a matter of fact, I actually did more in the goofball (maybe .2) than this morning shot. Two other people used the same batch with no ill effects.

<fast forward a bit>

Now, say a full hour post shot - only thing lasting is slower than normal heart rate (but no chest pain or tightness) and some shortness of breath.

I can't even drive a car for more than 5 minutes without heroin because the pain from simply holding down the gas pedal will completely exhaust my leg.

So yeah, my parents died a few years ago and left me a beach house on a lake, which I sold for enough to support my habit and live comfortably for the rest of my life.

So now all I can do is lay in bed 23 hours a day and have to have everything delivered to me. I watch YouTube videos and shoot heroin and eat xanax and smoke cigarettes all day.

Although the heroin helps the pain A LOT, I would have committed suicide a decade ago without it, I am still utterly miserable and am just waiting to die. I'm not suicidal, I'm just waiting to die.

I know this is a shitpost and you probably think I'm just a whining rich asshole, but until you've actually lived 24/7/365 with chronic pain for decades - every single second is torture without ever getting a break - only then will you realize how much more important health is than wealth.

I would do anything to go back to working a minimum wage job being dirt poor living with 2 roommates - if I could only have my HEALTH back.

I guess I'm rambling now, my point is just that health is that one most important thing in the world that you take for granted until it's gone, and not even being able to afford unlimited IV heroin can replace it.

And yes, before my parents died I was a broke homeless junkie. I would even rather go back to being a homeless junkie with my health still intact than a crippled chronic-pain-suffering junkie with a house.

Okay. That's all.

Well, after I blew through the first vein, I started to get very serious about trying to be as strategic as possible to prolong each veins life.

So, once I found a vein, I went out of my way to follow it up as far as possible. This allowed me to now hit an area just over 6 inchs long, over and over, instead of a 1 inch area all those times. Dont get me wrong, I still rotated arms and veins, but I tried to elongate my hit areas as much as possible. 


Unfortunately, I'm a junkie and of course I started to hit the easiest vein way too often and now its probably bye-bye.  But, in the process I've been able to get what I think are some pretty long tracks? The one in this picture is almost the exact length as my galaxy s8 plus. So, if I had to guess, I'd say its roughly about 6 and a half inches long. 

What's your longest mark? I'm curious to find out if me thinking that's a long mark is stupid and it ends up being pretty common for people to e longer ones?

Once I got settled at a system of lowering 1mg per week or 2, I‚Äôm now at 4mg and my doc has me going down 1 time per month now which I‚Äôm fine with id rather take longer and feel less than go faster. I accept this is a process.
Problem is on this whole system I never felt any discomfort I felt pretty great only a few times did I feel weird and have to take next dose slightly earlier the next day than I normally would. I‚Äôve got all my takehomes since I‚Äôve been clean the whole time but now that I‚Äôve hit 4mg from 5mg I‚Äôm really starting to feel withdrawal out of nowhere.
Last week I felt fine and normal no agitation, no sleeping problems, no muscle aches, and yet now 6 days after being on 4mg I‚Äôm feeling like shit - barely sleeping, living on 3-5 hours sleep per night , wake up with my one arm feeling weird and skin crawly, and can‚Äôt get back to bed after that, and generallly restless.
I don‚Äôt know what I should do, stick it out and try to hope I stabilize on this or what? I‚Äôve asked my doc what happens when I go from 1mg-0 and he let me know he will be able to prescribe me sleeping pills and things like that to help if I feel any withdrawal, do you think he‚Äôd prescribe it to me now while I‚Äôm still on the program?
I‚Äôm really proud of how far I‚Äôve come but it feels so hopeless now that I realize I haven‚Äôt even gone through with the hardest part as I believed I had done it already by forcing myself to stabilize on 30mg rather than go higher when I just got into the program, but that was so long ago I don‚Äôt even remember what that was like I‚Äôm imagining it wasn‚Äôt as bad as these withdrawals.
What helps you with withdrawal ? Either to keep your mind busy or to avoid feeling restless and irritated? 
I don‚Äôt want to use anymore I‚Äôve been clean so long and I‚Äôd like to keep it that way but I‚Äôm realizing I‚Äôm really lacking any coping methods because of how long it‚Äôs been since I‚Äôve withdrawaled from anything so it has caught me off guard.

There was no one to watch my back while I slept with Rufus locked up. I was running a real risk of waking up stripped of everything but my underwear. I‚Äôd seen it happen to nodding junkies before. The package in my bag would be a shame to lose. Karma though. If anyone stole it they would probably overdose. The stuff was too good. It was hitting me hard, and before I fell asleep, I thought on the first time I met my redheaded friend, Rufus.

The blind guy who plays the melodica on the corner by Safeway every afternoon told me where I‚Äôd find him that day in late October. Sure enough. There he was, just like the blind street musician said, standing with one foot on the curb another halfway out into the deadly traffic. His shirt was off. He was sweating and screaming into what I assumed was a phone, but upon closer inspection proved to be a large and tattered blue shoe. The closer I got, the quieter he spoke.

I wondered what kind of conversations people had on raggedy blue shoes and tried my best to hear what he was talking about or who he was talking to through the woosh of passing traffic. Who was this guy anyway? What was wrong with him? Mental illness ran rampant in the city. I was proof of that as much as he was. The content of his speech moved into strings of unintelligible grunting and desperate muttering. I think he said the name Thomas a few times. But that didn‚Äôt make sense. There couldn‚Äôt be anyone named Thomas on the other end of that shoe. That‚Äôs not how shoes work.

It didn‚Äôt matter to me, though. I came to score, so I caught his eye with a wave of the hand. He looked up and excused himself from the conversation on the shoe.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you Rufus?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho wants to know?‚Äù

‚ÄúMe. I got like 50 bucks. Looking for some tar.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean like 50 bucks? How many bucks is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got 51, but I wanna get some smokes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell. That puts you at 45 at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúK, then. I got 45 bucks.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy boy does 3 for 45. He does 4 for 50. Course you‚Äôre gonna have to give me one for getting it for ya.‚Äù This was a typical street junkie‚Äôs line when copping dope for a stranger. I know because it was the kind of thing I‚Äôd said myself to different customers over the years. I was new to town. There wasn‚Äôt much I could do about it, so I decided to forfeit the Marlboros and make due with whatever snipes I could find for the night.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get four.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got 50 on it?‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù

We walked down the hill. Cold air pushed through the street between the concrete walls of apartment buildings like a narrow valley of rock on a mountain. It was the first time we made that descent, and we would make it many more, every time with excitement. Along the way, Rufus dug in every trashcan we came to. He would pull out sloppy packages of checkered paper and pour slimy chunks of whatever it had once been onto the pavement and pick through it. Sometimes it was just a thin gruel. Other times, it was easier to identify, but it was always soggy and stinky. I had been on the streets plenty myself and even ate out of trashcans here and there, but only when there were other circumstances in play. For example, I watched a family of tourists throw half of a pizza into a can while it was still in the box once in another town. I snagged it up and ate it. No problem, but the things Rufus was pulling up out of these cans were no good. He wasn‚Äôt eating anything anyway. It seemed to be some sort of involuntary tick caused by too many years on the streets and too many drugs. If he saw trash, he had to dig in it. That‚Äôs just the way he was.

We got closer to where he was taking me. People exited the subway stations in droves. An fat faced Asian madame jaywalked. Her girls followed in fishnet and fake fur: one, two, three like ducklings after their mother. Dope boys juggled multicolored balloons in their mouths on the busy corner to junkies like us as we walked by. We lurked like skeletons of ragged bones wearing the foul rags of drug addiction stained in soot and grease and blood. Finally, Rufus addressed one leaning against a telephone post and reading a magazine. This was his guy.

There was a short exchange. I didn‚Äôt hear what they said, but the dope boy‚Äôs eyes darted back over Rufus‚Äôs shoulder to me and back again. They moved towards an alley. I followed, and Rufus reached his hand back behind him and held it out. I put the money in it. His guy spat one, two, three, four of the latex packages into his palm, rolled them to get some of the spit off and handed them to Rufus, who handed the money over. We walked one direction. His guy walked the other.

Rufus took me back to where he was squatting at the time. It was utility storage space under the concrete stoop of an abandoned house several miles from where we scored. It was getting dark, but I could still see well enough to fix. We melted brown morsels into tiny puddles of coffee colored magic and rolled up our sleeves. Blood flowed out, mixed and pushed back in. We itched. We scratched.

The place had vibes. There was a milk crate which he sat on. I sat on a shopping cart which had been flipped on it side. The walls seemed to be covered in scratches like a prison cell where the days had been counted. In the corner was a blackened blanket and tarpaulin folded up like a pillow in the dust. It got darker. Rufus lit a candle. We took turns closing our eyes and trying to put our foreheads on the ground. Between bouts of blissful sleep we talked.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù Rufus asked.

‚ÄúClyde.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmmm‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt like it?‚Äù No one had ever said that before.

‚ÄúNah. We‚Äôll work on it. I‚Äôll get you a better one soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt understand.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get into all of this?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Living outside? Heroin?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. All of it?‚Äù

‚ÄúLife. I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. It will. Ya know? I had trouble as a kid. Finally got it together by the time I was 18 for a few years. I managed a call center in Nevada where I got sober. Everyday, I went to work to pay my rent and bills. The next month, I paid all the money I‚Äôd made since for rent and food and all that again. The next month, same thing. It got old. You know. My car would be on E. I‚Äôd fill it. It‚Äôd be on E in less than a week again. I washed my clothes. They got dirty. I washed them again. They got dirty. And on and on into infinity. It was too much for me. I couldn‚Äôt handle it. Eventually, I got a grease spot on my shirt and walked away from it all.‚Äù

‚ÄúWalked away, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, let it go. I quit bathing or washing or working or paying rent. I just started using again and let myself and the place go.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, a grease spot on your shirt broke you? That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here living like this?‚Äù

‚ÄúI never thought about it like that, but yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo lady broke your heart or anything like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was engaged once.‚Äù

‚ÄúMmhmm‚Ä¶ What was that like?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was special.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of special?‚Äù

‚ÄúSpecial, you know, like she liked to have sex with all my friends when I was at work.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah. A real sweet heart. I know the kind, my friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure do.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSame sorta thing. Ain‚Äôt nothing to tell really. I was a promising med student. We got married. She slept with my father. End of story.‚Äù It would be years before he told me about their daughter and how she‚Äôd died of leukemia. ‚ÄúWhat can you do? No good in crying, so I threw myself full on into my work and made being a doctor my life‚Äôs work. I was an oncologist.‚Äù

‚ÄúStudied cancer?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery good. Most people don‚Äôt know that. I did. Eventually, though, I couldn‚Äôt hide from the gaping hollow inside of me. The great emptiness became too much. I started smoking and buying scratch tickets and tearing the tags off mattresses. One time I even dumped a load of trash under one of those signs that tells you there‚Äôs a huge fine for doing so. I started small, but I realized that I loved doing bad things. Eventually, I lost my license to practice when they found out I was addicted and writing my own prescriptions.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan. That sucks.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure did, but again, what was I gonna do? Cry? I don‚Äôt think so.  I was tired of it anyway.  You know everyday, stick your finger up someone's butt or hold their nuts in your hand.  Tell people they're going to die slowly and painfully.  Being a doctor isn't glamorous.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you do?‚Äù

‚ÄúI moved on to other things. Someone got me a gig giving eulogies and speaking at people‚Äôs funerals. Oddly enough, I was very good at it. People want to believe their deceased loved ones were the greatest thing that ever existed, even when they weren‚Äôt, so I just played it up. Said nice things.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow. That‚Äôs interesting.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. What happened with that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you know, addiction is bad enough to stand between a man and anything and everything he could ever want for himself. Besides that, though, I had this bit where I‚Äôd take these white doves or pigeons and release them from a basket as I said something about the beloved deceased‚Äôs soul being free from the body of flesh like the birds from the basket. Now they could fly high, unhindered by life and its weight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, one time, we were at this funeral on the side of the freeway. I released the birds. Two of them flew right into a semi going 80 miles per hour. Another one of the birds flew up into an oak tree there above the family and friends all dressed in black, and as soon as the other two got hit by the semi, the one in the tree was devoured by a cat.  We heard blood gurgling cries from it and wings flapping and even the crunch of its skull in the cats mouth. 
 Finally, it fell dead to the ground.  It was a ghastly sight. No one was happy. I didn‚Äôt want to do it anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúShoot. Don‚Äôt blame ya.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo? I was a deer strangler after that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a deer strangler do?‚Äù

‚ÄúStrangle deer.‚Äù

‚ÄúMakes sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt does, doesn‚Äôt it? Yeah. They‚Äôre overpopulated and a nuisance in certain parts of the north. A lot of neighborhoods have laws about discharging firearms or shooting live animals and that kind of thing. So, they pay someone to trap ‚Äòem and strangle ‚Äòem. It was good money.  A lot of free meat.  Left it too, though. Couldn‚Äôt handle it.‚Äù We talked until dawn. I gave him another balloon as the sun came up.

That was the first night we met. We were always together after that, always had each other‚Äôs back. He wasn‚Äôt there that night, though, under the theatre overhang next to the box office window with me. The sentimentality invoked by my memories faded. I drifted into a land of sleep and terror.

I had visions of evil in the dark and everything was on fire. The Faceless One would be the end of us. Rufus would die. It was made clear by the nightmare beings that visited me and the awful things they spoke to me as I slept. When I woke up, my arm was totally asleep. I was whimpering.

I've been an opiate chipper for a couple years now, but almost always low doses of hydrocodone every couple of months for chronic  back pain. Sometime late last year I discovered the cheap RC Opiate metabolite of Tramadol, and was using that almost daily, however I did quit several times (if only for a week or two). This chemical eventually vanished and I moved onto Oxycodone around June...

I quickly went from the occasional 20mg, to using 40-60mg daily pretty fast. I stuck with this for about a month or so before discovering Opana. Now I've been snorting about 20mg or so of Oxymorphone a day, which oddly enough doesn't give me much euphoria at all. In fact I usually don't feel anything unless I take a benzo with it, in which case I'll be awake until 5am doing who knows what. I've also never thrown up on opiates, even when I snorted 40mg of Opana one of my first times.

So now it's been about 2-3 weeks that I've been using both, with Opana being my preference due to the perceived cheaper cost per high (not true when you just keep climbing the ladder...). Before leaving for work I often do a quick 5-10mg line of Opana, but I don't usually feel anything from it.

So now I'm at a point where id like to take a nice long break, but I was curious how far into the hole I've dug myself? How hellish of withdrawals should I prepare for?

Thankfully I've got Subs, Kratom, Clonidine, and benzos, so it shouldn't be too bad regardless. Thanks!",1533768031.0

#‚ÄùTate here. Just popped three blues, but I earned it. 

Finally figured out a Goldilocks solution to GAIA's rather EXTREME executive authority. If that ain't worth 10-12 hours of dreamtime, what is?

Before this, every usurpation protocol I designed failed in simulation cuz it was either too hard or too soft.

TOO HARD, and it degraded the GAIA core. Sure, it pried Her figurative fingers off the figurative driving wheel so HADES could take control, but by breaking Her fingers - sometimes Her arms too. So that couldn't fly. Everything depends on GAIA taking control back after HADES has done its business, so had to find a solution that didn't leave GAIA any worse for the wear.

TOO SOFT, and GAIA only pretended to relinquish control. In simulation after simulation, HADES would take command of the terraforming system and reverse operations, only to have GAIA lurk in the background, quietly re-reversing processes and falsifying telemetry to hide its interference. Sneaky! I swear, ain't nothing GAIA wouldn't do to keep life going - even when it's just simulated plant life.

Turns out the ""JUST RIGHT"" solution is to isolate GAIA in a protective code shell, preserving its integrity, then ""un-seat"" it from command position so HADES can slip into the figurative captain's chair and work its magic. Um, those blues are coming on strong now, so I'm not really describing it so clear, but... pretty sure it'll work

#Yeah - those blues are plenty strongs.  guess it's time to sleep and bed. i'll back to it tomorrow alligators.‚Äù

I was lucky to have the opportunity and hoped to return to the big city one year later rosy-cheeked and refreshed, rejuvenated by the pure country air and wholesome rural ways.

So I head out and immediately get hit by a wave of punishing depression which goes on intermittently for most of the year.  It's OK though, I got this. Start taking valium which makes me tired.  Start taking some 3-year-old DHC to give me energy.  Yeah this can't possibly go wrong.

Six months in, making remarkable progress on house and although I've not yet realised, I'm now all but addicted to both valium and DHC, along with whatever other opiates I can get my hands on.  Have stopped drinking altogether though (I used to drink a lot), mainly because of all-but-total social isolation.  Persuade myself that this is an overall win and continue with wholesome rural ways.

Quit valium in March on a whim which isn't so bad, though at one point discover a dead bee inside my guitar and cry uncontrollably for the rest of the day.

Have somehow still not noticed that I'm now heavily reliant on DHC to function (500-700 mg a day), surely everyone needs a little dose or two to get up in the morning?

Nearly a year into wholesome rural life and am no longer capable of any genuine human emotion, barely speak to anyone outside of work and my bowels feel like I'm on a cement-based exclusion diet.  Penny finally drops.

Ho hum I've quit valium so coming off opiates holds no fear, I stride confidently towards the withdrawal process, laughing derisively at medical consensus that cold turkey should be avoided where possible.  This is advice for the weak, the pure country air has rendered me strong like ox, so without any real attempt to taper off, I take a final, mystifyingly large dose and flush the lot.  Job done.

Seems OK for the first twelve hours or so until... Oh fuck, something doesn't feel right...

Oh fuck fuck fuck fuck.  Do some belated research into opiate withdrawals.  Oh fuck.

Fuck fuck fuck.  A few hours of tectonic rumbling and my bowels explode spectacularly, a mere prelude to the days of misery which follow.  A shit-flecked hors d'oeuvre, if you will.

Brain, body and soul begin leisurely excursion through the seven gates of hell, I relocate to corner of the sitting room and spend endless sleep-starved hours curled up in a tiny ball, attempting to read sweat-soaked copy of Hamlet which I find on the floor.  Only get as far as publisher's name which I repeat, mantra-like, for next three days. 
Things get sordid, then even more sordid, then start to improve.  Eventually haul my battered soul out of its corner and back to real world.  After weeks of 35+ degree heat a violent storm breaks and I stand butt-naked in the garden, pounded by rain and raging winds like I'm King-fucking-Lear, which has a refreshing, cathartic effect and I start to feel a bit more human. Whole thing lasts barely a week but is deeply unpleasant.

This was only a couple of weeks ago but things are OK now.  Still feeling a bit sheepish but basically fine and enjoying the countryside, an eerie sensation of purity.  I even drank a glass of mineral water the other day, fucking mineral water which I poured into a fucking glass.  I guess it's all good but it's strange being off them, opiates sure are fun for a while but I was bested by the side effects in the end.  Wish I could tell you what the message is here but I'm not sure there is one.

Most of us know that drugs like naloxone (aka narcan) and naltrexone, which are opioid antagonists, block the effects of opiate agonists (such as heroin, oxy, fent, etc). This is why they are used for overdose (in case of naloxone) and vivitrol therapy (in the case of naltrexone). They do this by binding tightly to the same receptor (the mu-opioid receptor) and turning it off, preventing any other molecule (i.e. an agonist or endorphin) from binding to it and activating it (which causes the high).  


But the *amount of blocking* you get is dependent on the dose of the antagonist. If you only take a very tiny bit, there will be a small amount of blocking, but it won't be enough to affect the high to a noticeable degree. 


**What happens when you take just a tiny amount of antagonist is, though it isn't enough to block the high, it is enough to sort of ""balance out"" your receptors, enough to prevent the chemical changes that lead to the receptor being taken down by your body, which causes tolerance.** 


I've been doing this with suboxone, which I can get high on because I have a low tolerance. Suboxone already contains naloxone, a small amount of which is absorbed when you take it, just enough to cause this tolerance killing effect.  


**The result? Despite getting high on suboxone nearly everyday, I have not had to increase my dosage once in over 6 months. I still get the same strength of effect as ever. If anything, I've actually been able to decrease the amount somewhat without losing any effect. This means I never have to withdraw to lower my tolerance.** 


I have not tried this with stronger opioids like heroin or fent yet, but from what I've heard, it works just as well with them. 


**If you found this post informative, please give it an upvote so that others will see it and benefit from this knowledge as I have.** (mods let me know if it's ok to ask for this, I'll remove it if not, I didn't see anything about it in the rules anyway) We all deserve to be able to use these drugs without suffering so many negative consequences, don't think for a second you aren't worth it because YOU ARE. 


Shout out to u/captainfentanyl for recommending this idea in the first place. His comments are a gold mine for this kind of information.


Edit: A bunch of people have asked how much do you take for this effect? It's not really possible to say definitively on an individual basis. It could be as low as just 1mcg (0.001mg) , or even in the nanogram range. It could also be as large as *maybe* 100mcg (0.1mg) of naltrexone. The only way to find out is to start with an extremely small amount in the low end of that range and go up. You want the largest amount that doesn't produce any noticeable decrease in high basically. 


There is evidence to support all this btw, but as always, there are conflicting opinions as well. Personally I think this idea has huge potential, but that doesn't mean my own opinion constitutes scientific fact. It could certainly be that maybe this happens to work for one group of people in particular but might not work so well for some of you.

i got clean last summer and still struggling. i know it takes so long for your natural receptors to rebuild, but sometimes i get severe anxiety, paranoia and even where i see myself outside my body in conversation with someone and feel like people are looking at me. or i just cant stop thinking ppl are judging me. i have a beautiful gf and struggling in finding a good job. i know how many years i wasted getting high and it causes me depression. i feel weak. i feel like im a mess. im never clear headed which might be from smoking pot, but im trying to stop that as well. my anxiety is awful, even amongst family or friends. i used to be so chill, funny and easy to talk to. now im a mess. i miss that euphoric, everything is alright feelin from oxys. i was myself and never worried about looking stupid. im pretty sure i have bipolar or something , but opiates made me fee ‚Äúright‚Äù. im also a former model and that put pressure on me, like i have a certain ‚Äúimage‚Äù to uphold. ppl say they are surprised im so chill and nice because im handsome. but im not stuck up at all and my anxiety causes me to be less outgoing which only makes ppl think im stuck up.

as a child i had a speech issue and grew out of it, but thats also a insecurity i have as a grown man, that my speech will sound stupid or slur. this comes up now that im sober, as wel as working a crap job. i feel like im looked down on. i want to make my wonderful gf happy and proud. i cheated when i was using and things im making up for now. i want to be best man i can for her. she is my world.

No big deal, but it's easier just to block the call so that I can chooose when to answer on MY phone. Also so that I don't have to explain to my dad, ""don't answer the phone when Cliff calls, he and I used to do heroin together and sometimes I would loan him money on pay day and other times he'd just ask me to loan him money for all manner of things because he spends his money on dope.""

Vomiting and major headache later.,"About 5 weeks ago i ve decided to take a break from 60 mg a day oxy habit and went to Ukraine. I have two friends living in a different cities, one liked weed and beer, another just heavy drinker. Both are single, sociable people, so i thought maybe there will some single women aroind. Of course, it was just one of my delusions. One friend lives with a GF now and she wasnt keen on me even hanging aroind their house, i was on my own and didnt do well as usual. Ukraine is poor, but its a western country, which means women are picky, even hookers on a dating sites. With my budget being quite small my sobriety lasted two weeks. I only had a few oxy left, so i would mix them with codeine. They sell couigh medicine here, after CWE you get 80 mg of codeine from the pack which cost ,about $1.75. I am not happy spending $7 on 2 hour high, but by that time i wasnt happy about anything. So i went to see a second friend who lives in a cointryside hoping to get some poppy pods or a straw. Opium poppy is grown widely in Ukraine, people brew a crude form of morphine out of it, but i just planned to make tea. My friend is grumpy, because he cannot drink. He goes for a surgery tomorrow, he is diabetic and has a sepsys in his leg. He had four surgeries already and the shit just wont go away  he is taking shots of Nalbuphen, its syntetic painkiller, prescription only, but village pharmacist dont give a fuck. They also sell morphine , but out of it for today. He says he has some at home. He got them from the pharmacy in the Bronx last year and wasnt using. He just prefers liquor. i ask him for six. Now heres a funny part. The label on the bottle is old and worn out. Niether of us cant see the strenth without glasses. Not that we have glasses. I take six anyway, being delusional as usual i cant believe they are 100 mg pills. If they are, its a biggest stash i ever seen, over 100 . Maybe they are 10's.I take half, not much happening, i take another. 30 minutes later i walk around the garden, its too hot in the house, theres no tv, internet, hot water, friend went home, the alcoholic woman who hung there before isnt coming, well , i didnt invite her, she is older than me, besides i cant bear the thought of being rejected by her. I take another pill, now i am feeling bettet, i chain smoke, talk to myself, fuck the West, next time i am going to Cambodia, cant afford women, no problem, i ll hook up with a ladyboy. I want to nod out and take another pill. 
I think i started vomiting three hours later and didnt stop for three more. Had a awful headache next morning. The friend came from surgery, still woildnt drink just taking nalbuphen shots. I drank beer, wine, then some vodka. There still was no single women. At night i took 1.5 pills and thought about converting to Islam. Next day i went to town, got internet connection and googled the pills. There were 100's  I took equivalent of 200 oxycodone one day and 125 the next  so much for keeping my tolerance low. FUCK!
So, anyways, whats the best way to stretch the remaining 150? Boof it? Eating them just doesnt seem to be enjoyable enough. Considering the weight.",1533745517.0

* What, should I just keep doing dope for a month? -_-

Situation 2: This other doctor says initial consult runs $450 and then $350 per visit after.  Still no opening for a week.  Atrocious.

Finally, I found at least a happy medium:  this office does still charge $375 for initial visit (but only $175 thereafter)--however, they had a cancellation and will be getting me in at 10am tomorrow.

*Also additional edit:*

*I'm wondering if it would be wise to say go to this appointment tomorrow, get set up.  But then, because the other appt isn't set until 30+ days out and they accept insurance for visit:*

*Would it be worth trying to switch over to other doctor even if I start with this one?*

So after moving I had some medication I‚Äôd found in my old house. No opis or anything of value other than non narc pain meds, Gabas, a few ativans, and some antivert given to me during a vertigo episode from like 2 years ago. Fast forward it‚Äôs a week later I‚Äôve met some friends on campus with decent hookups for oxy 10s  and I‚Äôm set up. Now I got 20 and decided to dig around for some stuff to potentiate it instead of just moshing together benzos with what I prefer to take by itself. What I ended up doing was going to the pharmacy and grabbing some Tagamet and magnesium citrate. My pre dose for the opis was

-600 mg cimetidine(45 minutes before)
-500 mg magnesium citrate (35 minutes before)
-50 mg meclizine(35 minutes before)
Then 40 mg oxy 
And 1 and 1/2 hours later another 20 mg
And then 30 minutes after another 10 mg

This worked amazing
Very hard nods after a couple of hours and lasted for at least 5-7 hours strong the whole time. I like the meclizine way more than something like Benadryl because you keep the itch which I love but still catch a harder nod. Generally doing this is a lot safer than mixing with benzos so I thought if someone saw this just keep in mind it costs only 5-10$ for a bottle of all of these. Also meclizine can be bought under brand name Dramamine(less drowsy formula).",1533741281.0

If I ever take enough to feel euphoria, that feeling is pretty short lived because then I really want to take a nap and when I wake up from my nap is has worn off.

I‚Äôve been using heroin (and other opioids) off and on for 30 years (much more so in the last 5) to control depression.  When I get a new batch of heroin that I don‚Äôt know about, I always start with a very small dose and titrate the amount every 15 minutes upwards until just the most slight (but clearly noticeable) effect was felt. I then use 30% of this amount, so with most of my heroin use I really feel nothing at all (except I am no longer depressed :)  Like anybody I do really enjoy the feeling from heroin and **once every 3 or 4 months or so** I will dose 150% of this baseline amount I have determined for the batch to intentionally cause euphoria but then I would always feel like taking a nap.

I always seem to be looking for new ways to be stupid and a new probably extremely dangerous practice: Add 15mg (only) methamphetamine so I can enjoy the heroin. I have used just 15mg of meth 6 or 7 times in the past (over years, I‚Äôve had a gram for like 5 years (months between doses), one gram is 66 doses at that rate) when I needed to work all night or get a lot of housework done. I really have no interest in finding out what tweaking on meth is like (I don‚Äôt think I will ever do that). At this level the only noticeable effect at all is that I don‚Äôt sleep for 24 hours (unless I really try) and have 40% more ambition to get things done.  Is this a common combination?  I suppose probably isn‚Äôt because I suspect there are very few people taking just 15mg of methamphetamine, from what I have read people tend to go way overboard with it?

That's my day today. I'm not using the fentanyl that I have been dependent on for the last year, for today I have the day off, the weather is nice and I plan to enjoy a small amount of heroin shortly (without the nap) :)",1533734343.0

My body feels electric and i dream about it every time I'm lucky enough to sleep. I fucked around with some codeine, mushrooms and liquor to try and fill the void but I'm 99% sure I'm gonna have to pee in a cup today so I haven't been able to do  anything that fun to kill the time, or the pain. Weirdly enough it was shrooms that helped the most to smooth out the insatiable craving. Codeine didn't really help one way or the other and booze is not my thing anymore (borderline alcoholic until the day my first son was born but it almost immediately lost its luster)

I find out if I get my script renewed tonight at five o'clock but that may as well be next year. I haven't slept in two days (and for like a week before that) and now I'm just waiting to spend the day with my little humans and their mom before i go to the doctor's. Really hoping I can hold it together for them today. I've been in worse shape than this and still had great visits but I always feel guilty when my dependency prevents me from being the parent or partner that I know they deserve.

I just want to know how you guys feel about my situation. 

First I just want to say that I have been clean for 25 days. I used heroin for about a month and a half, having been clean for 3.5 years prior. I feel really good. I am happy. I eliminated a lot of toxic people from my life. I didnt use any kind of treatment like suboxone, I just dealt with the withdrawal for 3 days and started feeling better and more confident by day 4. Do I want to lay in my bed with warm dope fuzzies and itch my face while I watch spongebob and smoke a blunt? Fuck yeah. Do I want to deal with the aftermath? No. The decision to stay clean is one I make every day. But it is one that I am happy to make. It isnt easy, but I am okay with it not being easy.

So I have posted in both medicine (doctor) and nursing reddits, explaining what happened that caused me to fail in my last quarter of nursing school and fail at obtaining my nursing license. My failure was not addiction related, it was entirely financial issues and logistic issues and simply lacking a support system. It was not the right time in my life. I will post the condensed version of that story in the comments if anyone wants to read. The situation I was in has left me jaded about the nursing world. Combined with what has happened recently regarding my addiction, these two factors have left me questioning where I stand in the nursing/medicine world, how I am perceived and how I want to be perceived. I am basically having a huge identity crisis. 

Nursing is my passion. I live and breathe it. I have been a caregiver since I was 16 years old and I am 24 now. But just because I love my career doesnt mean that I do not have different components to my personality. It doesnt mean that I fit society's code of ethics when it comes to medicine. It doesnt mean that I am not an addict, or that I was somehow immune to becoming one. My addiction was never about my job. My addiction to opiates started when I was 19 as a result of an abusive relationship I had with someone. He tricked me into using heroin the first time and told me it was an oxy during a panic attack I had because he stole my credit card and drained it to buy dope. I was roped into riding along during the hustle while I was with my ex in an attempt to protect my car from being stolen by him. But Ive never stolen, hurt, lied, cheated, or otherwise done anything shadey to anyone in pursuit of my own drugs. My biggest fear is that someone will learn about my addiction and try to sabotage my career, or just simply be unable/unwilling to trust me. When I was in nursing school passing narcs. and even now during my shifts at work I do not have any desire to take my patients narcs - no matter how sick I was, I would never do that. When I withdrew recently, I suffered 3 12's in a row - but it was the only thing that kept me sane. It was the only thing that made me feel like I deserved to be clean and happy. I dont always like my patients and coworkers or agree with their behaviors, but I bring my heart to work and I do what I do from a place of love and respect. Out of love and respect for my patients and the nurses around me, I simply would never do that because it is unfair to the patient and could fall back on the nurse. I know how hard it is to get your nursing license, so I would never put someone elses in jeopardy.

All of this being said, my issue deep down in my heart is that I just want to speak. I want to talk about my addiction. I want to talk about my toxic relationships. I want to talk about the duality I live with every day being someone who has an addiction and still loves their job. I want people to be able to hear it from my perspective. I want to be there to validate other addicts and medical staff in their own struggle. I want to be a voice, because there are so many of us who have to dip our heads in shame and hide who we are from the world we immerse ourselves in for 12-16 hours a day, where political correctness is the most important factor. I want to tell my story so badly. I want to make Youtube videos. I want to have a storytime channel. I want other people to feel less alone, and feel brave when they face this.

But most importantly, I want to be allowed to be myself. I want to keep my career and continue helping people and doing what I love. while also being trannsparent and honest and forthcoming about what I have been through. I am terrified someone will recognize me. or dox me, or my employer will see or the board of nursing will see. I would never condone drug use on my channel. but I want to talk about the crazy shit I have seen and done and I dont want to have to withold information or bits of my story just because I might get fired.

What do you guys think? Would you guys like to hear from someone like me? Do you think I would be valuable to helping someone else succeed, or at least feel less alone? Does our community need someone like me?

I have gotten judgmental responses from the medical community on reddit. I received the response I feared and expected.

He is the only staff member that cares about the homeless, dealer, transient, addict  etc. population that hangs out in front of the building and spills into the parking lot and around the street corner everyday. 

When you go inside the entrance, it's a large parking lot with all the rooms' entries on the outside. The manager shows up around noon everyday and then checks rooms/yells at crackheads to get off the property or pay the fee Itbsy I'll discuss later, as well as people who need to pay for another day or pack up their shit. He then leaves around  6pm when everyone around the corner returns and the party reconvenes for drug sales johns/tricks, and the occasional undercover/CI that no one can figure out. 

This motel charges people a 'visitor fee' of $10 to go back to other people's room/enter the parking lot area. It's literally a fee to go and buy your drugs. All the staff other than the manager don't give a shit,  but he's just a prick.

Then the next two fuckin times I was still so clueless to the proccess that I drove up and down the block I had copped off first like 6 times and obviously seeing a car go up and down that frequently, people werent approaching me.

So tonight I reconsidered and approached it differently. I parked my car first and hopped out. Yet another homeless guy passes and tries to sell me a needle, I tell him I dont shoot but if he can take me somewhere to cop Ill toss him some cash.

Whistleblowers and politicians stopped that. 

The problem is that manufactures like Purdue Pharma, Insys, Endo, etc marketed their drugs as being less addicting, but that is leading to their demise. 

If those companies never marketed their products like that to doctors, the ""epidemic"" would most likely be happening to a lesser degree.

I think opioids should be provided to addicts in desperate need. I actually believe the US should provide prescription heroin like Germany and Canada.

I also don't like the fact that pain management centers group people with chronic pain with opiate addicts. It's not fair to us, and it has to stop.

Ethically speaking, chronic pain should be treated like any other disease. I remember the 5th Vital Sign...now that worked, but as with any other thing that works, they took it away.

So I've been prescribed bupe patches for pain management, and have been chewing them because... well... you know how it is. Right now I'm probably at a 3-4 mg / day bupe habit that's been going on and off for a few months, and I kind of want off the ride since it's getting stressful.

I have access to clonidine, and I hear that that really helps. I'll probably also have access to 10 g of tramadol to taper, too, and I have a whack ton of Xanax and will probably also have Ambien.

Anyone have any advice regarding the clonidine, and how unpleasant this will be? I tried a few weeks ago to get off by tapering to 400 - 600 mg / tramadol per day and I was rather sick... felt like garbage. I thought it was my chronic illness kicking back up, so I went back to the buprenorphine. Argh.

I am new here but have been reading your posts in this reddit page for a while now absorbing information. I am 67 and about 30 years ago i was involved in a very bad car accident, thus leaving my back and hip in terrible condition. I was originally given morphine and over the years have probably tried everything. 

In 2001 i was switched to Oxycontin 80mg twice a day. By 2003 i was taking a 160mg Oxycontin along with 3 60mg oxy.

Fast forward to 2014, i was switched to 1 OP 80mg and 5 30mg oxycodone k9 pills.
This was probably one of the better reactions my body has had, the k9 was great for breakthru pain and worked almost immediatley.

Now here is where things start to get bad. In 2015 i was t-boned in my car at an intersection on a snowy day. The injuries werent too bad but made my hip and back pain so bad it caused convulsions, no sleep, lost mobility ect.

I was pushed up to and today am currently perscribed 2 OP 80mg OR 2 opana 30mg (my doctor has given both so i choose depending on the day), 8 30mg oxycodone K9 and a few other random meds for blood muscles ect.

My problem is when i went to the doctor this morning he was telling me that because of the new pressure from dea that they are looking to cut my scripts down, he said next month they only want to give me 1 opana 30mg and 2 oxycodone k9.. thats it! Then the month after he mentioned something like 1 opana 20mg and 1 oxy k9.

In almost 30yrs this would be the lowest dose and im in more pain - HOW?

Im terrified of what is to come, what do i do? If i go to another doctor will i have better luck? I have enough going on in my life i really dont need added stress and concern with damn drugs but honestly i am so scared. What if i cant walk or i hurt so much i dont get out of bed? How could he do this to me? When i expressed my concern he said it wouldnt be too bad but i have to tell you something.. my friend killed herself earlier this year at 70 years old! Because she was cut off her dilaudid and could not actually preform functions she was in so much pain -  im scared! 
Please advise me what is it you do in this situation? Can i simply buy them somewhere? Im just looking to not hurt and my docs have done a great job for 30 years and im able to live, but im terrified of whats to come.

Thank you all for reading, im sorry to throw my problem at you but i just hope for some advice or what have you done in this situation.",1533667591.0

When I was maybe 10 I became aware that I had asthma. Asthma never goes away. I used medication for it when I was young but eventually stopped needing it.

Fast forward to dope. For the first 7 months, I could IV without any noticeable impact. I was blowing through every penny and loving it. But After a while of this I began to notice problems.

For one: I developed a severe hacking, productive cough that would never go away. I would wake up, hack my lungs out, spit up brown and red sputum and be off to go score my hit. My parents became concerned. They knew something was wrong when I had had a non stop cough since thanksgiving. I shrugged their concerns off.

I kept using. My problems became worse. I could no longer perform simple cardiovascular exercise. Pretending to shadowbox mid air for the effect of telling a joke put me into a world ending state of breathlessness and hyperventilation in which I had to posture myself with my hands on my knees bending over, staring at the floor with a blank expression while my friends looked at me with worry and confusion as they tried to figure out what the fuck was going on.

I would carry a backpack from my car to my parent's house and have to lay down on my side and focus on not dying. 

It got to the point where one day I simply could. Not. Breathe. My breaths drew in about 10% of my max lung capacity. I was so tight and had so much phlegm I truly thought I was at the end of my life. My mom begged me to go to the hospital and I finally agreed. The doctor takes one look at me and tells me my asthma is totally out of control. He wants to know why it has suddenly become so bad. Asthma? What? I have no problems with asthma. This has to do with dope. Can't tell him anything about my dope problem. It's not asthma doc.

Luckily for me, he didn't listen to me at all and gave me a nebulizer treatment right there and a steroid shot in my ass. Boom. I can breathe again. Holy shit, he might have been right, maybe this is asthma. He prescribes me a nebulizer treatment with albuterol/ipratropium bromide ampules and a fast acting inhaler. For a month or so, I can destroy my body with heroin and then recover at home with my nebulizer, inhaled steroids, oral steroids and a fast acting inhaler. I'm still addicted. Heroin is destroying my body and I don't care. I'm using, becoming bedridden on the verge of death, drowning in my own lungs, huffing nebulized albuterol and loading up shot after shot. I'm taking off days of work. I'm out of sick days. My boss is wondering what the fuck is wrong with me.

It has now gotten to the point where I cannot use any amount of dope without nearly dying. I took two small shots friday night and completely wrecked myself. Bedridden for friday night, saturday, sunday, and monday. I ate a piece of pizza, one bottle of sweet tea and a fourth of a jimmy john's sandwich in those four days. I could not even get up to get myself water or do laundry. I could not even breathe laying down in bed. My garbage can has about 14 empty albuterol ampules in it. I am still hopelessly addicted to dope. I have 5 suboxone in my personal stash.

My life is a dizzying carousel of suffering and recovery and I want to get off. Dope is not even remotely fun anymore but after a year of IV'ing I'm too addicted to quit on my own. I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do. I don't want to die but at 25, it looks like that is what is happening. What do I even do?",1533663202.0

Heroin to ween off methadone.,"I‚Äôve been hooked on methadone since 2015, before that heroin and before that Vicodin. I‚Äôm very experienced when it comes to drugs although I will admit I have blind spots in certain areas as I am only human. 

Methadone has improved my life in several ways. That being said it is by far the most addictive and hard to get off of than any other opiate or drug I‚Äôve ever done. In my opinion- getting off heroin was easier. 

The withdrawals are also horrible and make my joints and bones hurt. Especially where I fractured my back. 

I read about diamorphine maintenance that they do in Europe and I got to thinking. Maybe I should just quit methadone and get a eightball if good raw heroin off the onion farm. 

Whenever I feel sick just do a bump. 

If I don‚Äôt get carried away- use it safely, have narcan on hand, don‚Äôt use needles, do little bumps, buy tested fent free dope, and only do it to get by- maybe it‚Äôs the better way to go. I would save lots of time and money (80 mile round trip every morning and 80$ a week) and that‚Äôs before I do my 50 mile round trip in the afternoon for work. 

At least this way there will be euphoria and I will get my mornings with my gf back:)

Hey guys I was hoping someone can give me 5 mins of their time and type up a quick guide for someone looking to administer IV heroin themselfs for the first time.

I have experienced the needle before and wasn't too impressed, this time I'd like to try it myself with my own dosages and own gear (pure, from online).

One time I tried this I was super nervous and couldn't hold the rig straight (the gauge was also too big I found out) and I also blew like an inch of air into my arm and it puffed up and i freaked the fuck out so I put the gear up my bum instead.

I am not worried about OD however do you think that someone who can tolerate 800mcg of fentanyl nasal spray \*\*(ROUGHLY THE SAME AS 200MG OXY BUT MORE SEDATING) \*\* could handle half a point of 'pure' (they say it is pure but apparently some smart people did lab tests for the community and its like 73% or something which I believe is still fairly impressive).

Anyways  This time I am a little bit more prepared and watched it administered by others but I have a few questions:  


\- If i am using pure china white that dissolves in liquid without leaving a trace, I don't need to do the whole cooking on the spoon thing like Americans right ? (I am Australian, gear is pure SEA china white bought from very reputable Dmarket seller)

\- Do I have to tie a belt around my arm and make the veins pop out? I see other people just eyeball a vein and go for it, since I am only 70kg, dont ever IV (fresh veins everywhere), can I just pick a vein and go ham?

I will likely go back on, but won't be on such a high dose, as I cannot deal with this chronic pain, but it'd be nice if a small amount of oxy took the pain away like the good ole days.

I used the 5 day bupe WD help program. Which made life so much more easily, and the short term nature means there's no bupe withdrawal.

The literature say it should be done like this.

* **Day 1** - 4 mg at onset of withdrawal, & additional 2 to 4 mg evening dose prn || 4 - 8 mg/day
* **Day 2** - 4 mg mane, with additional 2 to 4 mg evening dose || 4 - 8 mg/day  
* ** Day 3** - 4 mg mane, with additional 2 mg evening dose prn || 4 - 6 mg/day  
* **Day 4** - 2 mg mane prn; 2 mg evening prn  ||  0 - 4 mg/day
* **Day 5** - 2 mg prn 0 to 2 mg  
* **Day 6** - no dose 
* **Day 7** - no dose  
Total proposed dose 12 to 28 mg

My first day I did about 3mg. And then the second day one dose of 2mg. 3rd 1mg, 4th 1mg and today 5th 0mg.  I felt a bit of the withdrawal but figured that would be a good idea, as it might help me recover faster, and no that it's working.

So, this happened a year or so ago and I'm hoping someone can explain to me what the deal is.

Back before I had a script, I used to buy Oxy on the DN. Around 28x40mg OC every month. So I had a moderate tolerance.

One day I thought fuck it and out of complete curiosity, I bought 0.5g of the highest quality #3 I could find. I tested it and it came back good. I also had a great profile (5/5 feedback).

The vendor I bought from came recommend and would only deal on recommendations. Anyway, I know it was high quality.

So, the day arrived. I rather excitedly got my post, unwrapped the .5g (it came in foil ready to smoke) and got prepared. My tolerance around then was 40mg Oxy for a buzz, 80mg to nod.

I put about 100mg on the foil and chased it around. It bubbled away and ran red on the foil. 

Here comes the issue/saving grace depending on your view. I felt absolutely nothing at all. No high. No tingle. Nothing.

So, I tried again. Still nothing. If it matters, the .5 cost me ¬£30 (~$50)

I know I smoked it right. I know I held it in right. 

Since then, I have just stuck with my Oxy. As I get a decent script ever month, I haven't bothered trying it again.

I'm still very curious. Can anyone shed any light on this?

My personal affairs,  my family,  so on..I do wish my girlfriend wasn't so rude to you tho,  that might have made things worse,  lol..who knows?.But if what you say is true, I'm confused..I should know ""Your brother,""..and according to you, I spend thousands of dollars on drugs and he is getting his as a direct result of me, that's not possible..the drugs iv gotten ""recently""are far from anything of that nature , these are people in the inner city, and there not your tone, if ya get my drift..and there's only one person I can think you may be, if your in Oregon I know..And I'll tell you this sista, your brother has WAY more problems then me..One is right under your nose..and if that's not you, listen up..if you want help for your brother,  he needs to seek it, you running around throwing others under the bus sure in fuck isnt going to do it..It will actually push him further away, trust me..Why not tell me?.Why not tell me what's happening with him?.You think I wouldn't care?..You seem to know a lot about me, if you do, you know that's not me..So I have to wonder your true intentions?.are they what you say?
Or do you have some sort of other agenda?.well..I hope you decide to be real and contact me, maybe I can actually help..and I promise,  I'd never lie to you when it comes to this fucked up disease of addiction, yea, I know that sounds very untrue coming from an addict,  but I'm not as far gone as you think, I still have morals and dignity,  and I'd NEVER turn someone on to this shit that hasn't already done so..period..I've been on both sides, soberity and active addiction, and I've seen more then you know, so..the choices are yours,  maybe we'll meet.

EDIT: having been on Vivitrol for awhile I've been using from day 28 since my last shot through day 32, so 5 days actually. However I've felt next to nothing for the 5 days, meaning most of my receptors are still blocked with more than lingering amounts of Vivitrol apparently. Not sure if that would play a role in the physical dependency or not because withdrawal occurs as the remaining opiates in your body are leaving the receptors so it sounds like that might factor in.",1533614389.0

Today I went to a neurologist, talked with him, and for the first time he doesnt judge me, and he knew a lot bout opiates. I told of my huge habit 500mg/day of morphine IV, told that I wanted a bupe/methadone taper, and finally got it.

But I got a few questions, he didnt know about precipitated wds, for example. He prescribed my a 20mg patch, without naloxone, just bupe (transdermal system, only avaiable here, we dont have in pills form). The patch is supposed to least a week, with peak in 3 days. 

His plan is to taper me on bupe, then put me on fentanyl patches (we have fentanyl transdermal patches) that patch should least 3 days, and then methadone, and then off, I didnt understand that, it should be from methadone to bupe, right? and the fentanyl too wtf

I took 80mg today of methadone (where I get my morph, when the pharm doesnt have morph, I buy dones), and tomorrow I will pick up my morphine (already paid before that), so I dont gonna go to bupe before I end this 60 pills of 30mg morph. 

I was thinking in staying in morph for 7 days, got methadone off my system, and then wait 24h after my last morphine dose. I think its gonna be a little smoother, can someone give me an advice?

He looked different as he had in the past. We made contact and the way those eyes penetrated my soul, it made my heart skipped a beat, which made it beat faster. My forehead heated up, remembering the passion flowing through me, while flirting with him. 
I remembered the hold he had on me, the one where I would run away screaming, only to come back when I thought I couldn‚Äôt live without him. 
I decided to walk up to my old lover to see if he recognized how far I have gotten, without him in my life.
I remembered why I loved him so much, while he touched my lips and was so gentle. I felt my face blush, yet didn‚Äôt want him to stop. My breath drew quickly, from his touch. 
So many thoughts running through my head as he kissed me, so passionately. I immediately wondered if I could go all the way and not get sucked in, as I did before. I wondered if I could let go, once the passion turned toxic. I thought of the previous time, the hurt and pain it caused. Getting over it I thought I was going to die, to wake up and feel like I haven‚Äôt sleep, eyes constantly tearing up, thoughts of suicide and a depressive state occupied my head for months. I grappled with what to do, as I slipped back into familiar territory. I knew I would allow that lust to come back into my life again ...
And again ...
I kiss back, praying inside and telling myself I can handle it this time. It was more of an attempt of convincing myself that I would not let the love overpower me once again. Yet I fell, I allowed myself to fall in love/lust once again. 

When will I abandon this love I have?  I can drop a destructive boyfriend in a minute but this destructive love I can‚Äôt let go of.

.. Im currently taking 3 to 4 Percocet 10s a day.. 150 lbs, 27 yr old female, been using the tabs/percs for 3 years-ish daily and 2 years before i got back on the tabs/percs, i kicked my 1.5 year opana addiction on my own, only to end up working opiates back into my life slowly but surley a couple years later. So you can say on and off for 7 or 8 years.. 

 For a year I have been doing weekly mental health therapy sessions to help with my c-ptsd, anxiety, depression and panic attacks- basically trying to treat my mental health issues and develop new coping mechanisms to make my risk of relapse lower.. I feel like i finally have faith in myself in getting sober and i feel like i am in a much better place mentally than i have ever been. Also have been doing physical therapy to help with my pain so i dont have as big of an excuse to reach for pain pills/to rationalize my usage. 

Now, i have been weening down to only 5mg at a time some times and trying to stretch my dose out to every 5 or 6 hours instead of taking 10mg every 4 hours. Its kind of torture as im very moody and that weird tingle feeling of my bones jumping out of my skin is the worst.. But none the less im trying to make it easier for when my quit day comes.. Which im hoping will be in 2 weeks.

Here is my actual question:
I know you likely arent doctors but in your experience and opinion, is detoxing alone safe for someone of my dosage? Im kind of wanting to rent a cheap cabin in the woods for 5 or 6 days and just bite the bullet- away from my bf who i dont want to lash out at due to my pain and anger and anxiety that rushes to the surface, away from everyone and everything that could be a trigger. I have valium to use to ease the withdrawl and im not wanting to use suboxone. I am not the kind of addict that goes balls to the walls with any old substance- i dont like anxiety meds enough for the valium to be a problem and will take them safely- opaites is my weakness, not anxiety meds and i know how to ration and control myself with those valiums so i dont think that part will be an issue. 

Have any of you detoxed off this amount? Did you do it alone? What do you think about this plan? I Just want to make sure im not going to have some physical reaction that could cause me to die or something.. I have heard opaite withdrawal cannot kill you unlike alcohol withdrawal. Any insight would be appreciated.

The cops wanted to rip the house apart and charge them all with so many things. Assault (of which I have video of the threats of violence and the assault itself), drug charges out the ass (of which I have voice recordings of them admitting to stealing my medications), international drug trafficking since they brought pills back from Europe 4 times and admitted on audio recording, the list goes on.

Especially if it's uneventful and doesn't warrant added attention to detail. Some have expressed disappointment, a smaller subset of which I suspect are not pulling my leg when they say ""this post sucks, it's not ams good as when something bad happens to you."" Of course I'm paraphrasing and I don't think anyone genuinely wants harm to come my way. They just want me to experience enough shenanigans to make the store worth reading. I get it. 


&nbsp;

Yesterday I agreed to drop by his house to have some birthday cake and to catch up for twenty minutes. He said ""even if you go out, drop in on your way back for cake for like twenty minutes."" While riding my bike home from work I was abit hungry and reluctant to go to Cliffs -- I had cold feet. He called once and I cursed my phone a few times, I scream ""fucking shit"" or something with the ""F"" word and when I neared a pedestrian I turned my head and said ""pardon me."" Well, there goes my hope that he'd pass out and forget that I'd be getting off work. I decided to pull over and think.

&nbsp;
 
Right off the bat I knew that his house would likely smell bad, maybe worse and maybe worse because of my senses being mal-adapted. So I decided to eat my cold slice of pizza outside on the service road as I read responses to my last post on Reddit. This was the only way I could enjoy this pizza aside from going home first. After the pizza biked to a deli then called Cliff back to announce the fact that I shall be arriving shortly. The plan was to secure my bike outside and then to leave my backpack on the hood of the car in the driveway - there was no way or reason for me to bring that backpack inside the house. One less item that in need of thorough decontamination. Still treated it as though it was contaminated since I did put the backpack on my back when I left.

&nbsp;


#Upon opening the door

A fruitfly entered my mouth, I spat it out and sputtered my lips lightly to ensure nothing else gained entry. Right after that I noticed the smell, a sense that is linked to memory and remembered other times I'd enter at the start of a wait which I no longer engage in. We greeted one another and shook hands, it was a little sticky and presumably sweaty. The cake was just taken out, an icing cake as opposed to ice cream cake. I chose the plastic chair since it carried a lower risk of bed bug infestation. 


&nbsp;

A cake, a cola and a paper towel for a napki, the lst of which rapidly became forfeit when I saw a family of fruit flies crawling along it's textured surface. Hell, one fly ended up on the icing of my cake - I blew on it really hard until it left because it wouldn't leave when I tried flicking it with my spoon. What am I to do? Fuck it, it's just a fruit fly as opposed to a full grown house fly. 



**Fact:** A fly's mouth is like an elephant trunk, except that it squirts vomit in order to externally digest food enabling the fly to slurp it up! So, when a fly lands on your food, it stands to be reasoned that it's going to at least drool a little bit of vomit.


&nbsp;


So anyway, of course he was curious and seemed genuinely interested in what I was up to, what my potential job opportunity was and so forth. He called out to his mom, ""that's right near where you used to work."" I forgot some details but after eating the cake he asked if I'd stick aroudn another 15-20 minutes to check movie times. Sure I could do 10-25-20 minutes but I must be up early tomorrow I said in order to set expectations. We ultimately conclude that Wednesday or Thursday is the best day to see the movie and we  briefly discuss candy. Things like when and where to get the candy... he says ""maybe we'll make a stop on the way"", which I pointed out is not ideal with a cab or Uber.

&nbsp;


Basically I said I'd be happy to get the candy before the movie so we don't have to make a stop. He gets paid that day and says he's buying the tickets so I'd be neither suprised or annoyed if I'm expected to get the candy as it's quite fair. Cliff did mention that he'd probably get a soda at the thetre because a 20 ounce soda won't last too long. That's fine, though now I think about it, he could just buy a liter. It's not like his baggy shorts couldn't accomodate it.


Oh speaking of shorts. He had to pull up his pants for lack of a belt before we sat down, but I noticed that this pair of shorts were more ripped than his boxers which havve appeared in the past to only consist of the elastic waist band and a layer of cloth on one side but not both and not contiguously. 

&nbsp;


Well anyway, I'm not here to shit on his fashion - just mentioning because I'm damn near certain he's not going to wear these shorts to the movie but if he did the weight of a soda would pull them down and it would be very unwieldy.

I mean like, I shouldn't speak too ill in this particular post because he's offering to do something nice - to buy me a movie ticket. To do a wholesome activity that friends do which does not neccesitate consumption of drugs.


&nbsp;

Speaking of drugs, he offered me an oxy pill (to be crushed into a line) three times ""for old times sake."" Each time I declined, first time I was clear that I don't pass judgement on people's choices in terms of partying in this manner but that I've come so far and that I do not want to reset my counter now. He acknowledged in an understanding manner and continued along. As we spoke about his pay day coming up he also casually inquired if I was getting paid this Thursday. I casually said, maybe... but I mean like obviosuly yes. I know when I get paid and Cliff knows I wouldn't not know. 


nbsp;


I didn't ask him why he cared when I was getting paid but I did state ""yeah, I'll have no trouble getting candy."" I didn't snap as I would have back when  I was in the game. I used to snap and say ""I'm not spending my whole paycheck on dope!"" Like to head-off expecations that used to exist. From the bygone era when I only bought dope through Cliff and if it was my pay day and not his was loaning out dope thereby doubling my cost while cutting my own enjoyment in half.


In this case, I can't quite read between the lines. It's not as simple as mid November when he mentioned plans of buying a brick of dope so that neither of us would be sick through the holiday. Of course the implication was that I'd be chipping in on that brick, which in itself isn't unfair but I was not letting him butter me up to that idea at the time because I knew that if it turned out he didn't get paid on time that I'd be the one buying the brick until he could pay me back for his share of it. At the time I said ""I'm not spending all my money on a brick."" To which he'd respond, ""I'm not saying that you are.""


Point is, many times it became possible to read between the lines in order to identify Cliff's unstated intentions.



Like I said, in this case I must be rusty because I can't seem to figure out what he may be plotting, if anything at all. He may yet still just genuinely want to see this movie and nothing else but I can't help but expect a ""gotcha"" or ""one other thing."" Maybe it was a genuine inquiry just to ensure that I would be able to buy candy while he buys the movie tickets - as opposed to me being down to my last $20 saying last minute on movie night ""I can't get candy because I paid for the Uber.""


&nbsp;


He wasn't particularly insistent about doing a 15mg linme of oxy ""for old times sake"", aside from offering it three times over the course of thirty minutes but I wouldn't be surprised if on movie night he offered again. I can resist it no matter wahat but I hope for his sake he isn't overly insistent on it. That will reduce the liklihood of me hanging with him in the future. Even so, I can't spend long chunks of time in his house. The bugs and the smell. My shirt smelled like a combination of mold-food when I got home and took it off. The sweat and humidity makes it way worse than in winter.

&nbps;

In conclusion, I don't have time to edit this post because I have to be ready for something important in less than one hour. I had every intention of keeping this post short since there was no action or anything bad that happened to me. I bet if I typed this on my smartphone it would've been way shorter.

The complexity of the corruption and the vast amounts of energy expended at the express purpose of forcing others to suffer disgusts me, and it has ever since I was old enough to understand what was really going on around me. At the same time I am overly empathetic and tend to genuinely care about the well-being of others,  friends, family and strangers, so my anger does not get expressed through the disrespect or mistreatment of other individuals. Instead of taking out my anger on other people I take it out on myself. Over time, the inner rage develops into a hatred manifesting itself as my own thorough type of self-destruction. It is one of my basic needs to relieve myself of the anger, rage and confusion justified ironically by the continued injustices experienced by my generation while trying to survive in modern American society. Which is why the worst decisions I make always feel the best. As much as I try to tell myself, as much as I try to believe that I can be happy, successful and healthy, I will ultimately restrict myself from achieving any goals that are purported to be ‚Äúpositive.‚Äù  I think now that I can be actually happy by excepting this recent realization as a self diagnosis and running with it. Thus, actually relieve myself of much of the guilt that I create just as a byproduct of convincing myself that my decisions are ‚Äúbad.‚Äù  It‚Äôs time for me to truly disconnect from the ideas, judgments and opinions of society at large.

It was dark black tar with a pungent aroma. He only worked from 11 in the morning till 8 at night. We‚Äôd call the number, which was really to one of his buddies sitting in a house and tell his buddy where we were. That guy would use a walkie talkie or boost mobile to tell Victor. They always said, ‚ÄúTwenny meenus. Twenny meenus,‚Äù but it was never twenty minutes. It usually took him a whole hour or two of neighborhood residents and store managers eyeing us as we waited and looked suspicious sitting on a random street corner curb.

I did half gram shots of it. That was a good dose for me. The stuff that I‚Äôd gotten from Fin and Jimbo, though, was way better than Victor‚Äôs stuff. Fin told me to be careful, so I was. I poured three match heads worth into that little aluminum cooker and didn‚Äôt even have to cook it. It turned the water translucent brown with a swirl of the black rubber plunger.

I always say that the rush, for me anyway, is like an elephant stepping my chest or back. I have always attributed it to the constriction of bronchiole tubes and veins that made it feel like that, and as I sat on that orange bucket next to a dirty mop and some piping running through 2x4 studs, I thought it might be too much. It scared me. Getting up and getting to where Fin and Jimbo could see me would be the best bet as far as being where someone could watch me and call the ambulance, but it wasn‚Äôt that serious. Sublime slumber. The nod lasted until late afternoon and the day glowed blue in the streets and warm yellow lights turned on through the windows in the city.

I stood up satisfied with what I‚Äôd gotten from that last hit. Jimbo handed me a cup of coffee in a Styrofoam cup. It was cold. I spit it out. Fin was watching TV and smoking another joint. The fat dalmatians still laying at his feet.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you do that for?‚Äù He asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? So?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúK.‚Äù He took the cup and put it to his lips. He drank. I grimaced.

‚ÄúYou like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. I like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever. So, the stuff‚Äôs really good.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mess with it myself, but you know that. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs the best.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd say so. What does the Faceless One want with Bug‚Äôs eye, anyway?‚Äù

The Faceless One had been a pimp and dealer in the 80s when crack was first hitting the streets in a big way. They called him Joseph Junior back then. He‚Äôd gotten to be notorious and feared, but one of the girls who worked for him got killed by a John while she was working.

As if having your daughter working in the sex trade and turned out for dope isn‚Äôt bad enough, her father lost his mind when she got murdered. He found Joseph Junior and pretended to be a customer, but when he got close enough, he opened a bottle of sulfuric acid and threw it in his face. Supposedly, the skin on his face had been completely melted to the skin on his shoulders and chest. Teeth stuck out. It was hard to tell where his jaw had been. His eyes had turned into milky blue orbs. He was blind. Reconstructive surgery only did so much according to Jimbo, who acted as a liaison between street thugs like me and the Faceless One. He‚Äôd seen him once. The rest of their correspondence was through the first girl to ever work for the Faceless One, now a middle aged Russian woman named Natalia. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to know that. Jimbo always told me more than he should have.

Since then, his power had only grown. Legend on the streets had it that he appealed to Satan himself during one of the first surgeries during which the anesthesia almost killed him. Now, his body was inhabited by some evil and ancient entity. He wasn‚Äôt Joseph Junior anymore. He hadn‚Äôt been for years.

‚ÄúListen to me, Boom Boom. What the Boss wants with Bug‚Äôs eye is anyone‚Äôs guess. I don‚Äôt ask. If it were up to me, I‚Äôd be out of this whole thing, but now I‚Äôm involved. I can‚Äôt get out or else you might be coming for my eye next.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd never.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd never but you never know what happens when you‚Äôre pushed.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. But you know me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. You‚Äôre good people, so I‚Äôm gonna let you know something.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour friend. You know the one that tells everyone he‚Äôs your brother?‚Äù

‚ÄúRufus?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Rufus.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWord is he needs to stay away from that woman he‚Äôs been talking to.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù

‚ÄúJaqueline Onassis over there on the bench by the bay.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlly Alcoholic?‚Äù She wore glasses and a bandana on her head at all times and always sat on the same bench. She was pretty too, except for her legs which stuck out of the one-piece bathing suit she always wore. They were plum colored and bent unnaturally like baby doll arms.

‚ÄúIs that what you guys are calling her now?‚Äù

‚ÄúHer name is Allison McDonald but yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. He needs to stay away from her. I know you care about him.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what if he doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell you know better than I do what happened to Bug.‚Äù

I knew he was talking about some obscure command which had come from the Faceless One to him about Rufus talking to Ally. It didn‚Äôt make sense. There was nothing I could do about it though and nothing Jimbo could do either. I hoped Rufus would listen when he got out.

‚ÄúI do. K. Jimbo, I‚Äôm out.‚Äù I waved to Fin. ‚ÄúSee ya, Fin.‚Äù

‚ÄúBe careful out there.‚Äù They said in unison.

Jimbo‚Äôs shop was only a few blocks from where we usually slept. After everything I‚Äôd just heard about Rufus and the Faceless One from Jimbo and Bug‚Äôs eye, I felt empty.  Probably the heaviest thing was that Rufus wasn‚Äôt with me. As much as I hated the way he smelled and obnoxious ramblings about nothing, I missed him. The rain fell in soft black whispers on the asphalt. I sat under our overhang on a piece of cardboard.

*A half ounce of the best.* I thought. My package sat inside of my backpack which I had opened at the top and held the stash I‚Äôd just gotten. I stroked it like my pet. I pulled the same needle I‚Äôd used earlier at Jimbo‚Äôs and got ready to fix again for the night.",1533520177.0

**DANGER**: Using large amounts of Imodium and/or using Imodium over a long period of time can cause heart damage and other bodily damage up to **death**. I am not a medical expert and can not recommend using Imodium as a safe withdrawal method. I have used up to 40-50mg of straight Loperamide a day to minimize withdrawal symptoms accepting the possible risks associated with it, but I've never exceeded 60mg and have never taken it consecutively more than 3 days, and then only take it when absolutely necessary (maybe twice a month). 

There have been deaths from users who reportedly were taking 100s of mgs a day repeatedly. I have heard anecdotally of Imodium addicts taking ~100mg a day, and some have reported heart damage. Loperamide addiction is one of the most dangerous drug addictions one can have - it is *known* to be cardiotoxic at those dosages, not telling what other damage is caused since Loperamide addiction is relatively new and thus has not been thoroughly studied. Its withdrawals are also surprisingly horrific and probably very long given how long its half-life is. All for a ""high"" that feels more a flu than a real opioid high. 

******************************************************************************************

Regardless, Loperamide has been a lifesaver for me during withdrawal - not just for withdrawals but for overall symptoms, **especially** RLS. With a ~1g/day IV heroin it, taking 40-50mg/day reduced almost every physical withdrawal symptom. I can even sleep with it, which is a *miracle* while in withdrawal. In fact, that's about all I do while using it during withdrawal, since while it makes withdrawal *bearable* it doesn't make them go away completely. 

Anyway - finally to my point - I've been able to buy straight Loperamide (Imodium) pills (small green pills 2mg each) for ages at just about any Walmart or grocery store in the country, they've recently been starting to crack down on them. Which is just lovely, because now at my local Walmart the only options are some liquid concoction which I've never tried before, and these new capsules that are 2mg Loperamide and 125mg Simethicone. They're a lot bigger than the traditional small green pills too, so it'll definitely be a lot harder to swallow the 15-24 I usually do for a day.

Anyway, how safe is Simethicone? It worries me a bit that they've added it to their formula. Looking it up it appears to be an anti-gas agent. If I take 15-24 pills then that is 30-48mg of Loperamide and 1875-3000mg of Simethicone. 

Has anyone had any experience using pills with this before? Will that dosage of Simethicone make me drop dead or otherwise cause organ damage? 

If there's a better sub to post this question then please redirect me. This whole crackdown on Imodium is annoying the shit out of me. Anyone trying to get ""high"" on Imodium is an absolute moron and risking death or permanent heart damage for a super shitty ""high"" that will feel like a fever high. I'm aware that the dosage I take isn't exactly *safe* either so please don't preach to me - I'm actually hoping to take that amount of Imodium for maybe 4-5 days at most, dropping the dosage each day, to hopefully wean off opiates for a final day and (ideally) say sayonara!

It looks so much better now and she has much more confidence. And the kit was less than $25!

If you are suffering from lack of dental coverage please Google diy dentures.  There are some dental labs that provide low cost kits and kind of walk you through it.

Also don't forget about calling 211, in the U.S. & most of Canada.  They can help you find whatever help or assistance you need.  Maybe there is a local dental clinic that takes patients at no cost once a month.  Or maybe a regional dental school travels to your community occasionally.

Also pop a 2mg bar to knock out at night.

I have been doing kratom for about 6 months. I started it to get off oxy, and now I alternate between the two. I'll typically do one or two weeks on one, then switch to the other for one or two weeks. Kratom is much much more affordable, so it saves me a lot of money. 

Kratom, in my experience, is not nearly as enjoyable as something like oxy. However, after experimenting with a lot of doses, I found one that keeps withdrawal and anxiety away. The past few months I've been doing 4-6 grams a day and it keeps me pretty relaxed, feeling normal, some euphoria. However, lately, my normal dose has been making me very jittery. It's the same feeling I was getting from doses like 1-3 grams months ago when I was trying to find a place I liked. Do you guys think this is maybe my tolerance increasing?

The main reason was that I found out it was his mom's birthday, so I wanted to wish her a happy birthday. After pleasantries, the first order of business was to find out what Cliff was calling about. He even gave the stated that he's not calling to ask for anything from me.I mean yeah he asked me when I was working today and invited me to drop by to have some Birthday cake which his mom was insisting upon. 


&nbsp;


I made it clear that I have to prepare for a job interview tomorrow, he doesn't need to know that I scheduled it for late afternoon or that it's a webcam interview. If I drop in for brithday cake, I want to minimize my exposure - regardless I will have to go through full decon when I get home. Strip in my back yard, check my body and hair then steam my clothes. Of course by then I'll change into clean pants. Maybe I'll create some gonewild content but I wouldn't recommend holding your breath in anticipation.



&nbsp;


Preparation must be made, I really do intend on being in and out. I want to make sure I clean my room for the webcam job interview, make sure my webcam works and if it doesn't do something about it and maybe setup a green screen so I can have a false background for the webcam interview. Something like a big ass hallway, the cargo bay of a star ship or something else cool. Then finally, I want to get a good night's sleep and wake up
 hours before the interview so I'm perky and mentally prepared.

I might even buy a fancy microphone for my computer today just to be on the safe side. It's good having money left over because I'm not spending it on dope.


&nbsp;


Anyway, what has Cliff been calling about? The new Mission Impossible movie. So yes, I guess you could say he wants to go on a movie date with me. Well that's good, it's safer than being invited to watch a movie in his house. I'm bad at saying no and bring confrontation at times and for fuck sake he's inviting me to see a movie with him, how can I justify adopting a hostile tone? So in good faith I'm willing to see the movie with him. For me I'm good as long as I'm not exposed to his smelly bed bug infested home for long periods of time and as long as there is no financial entanglement.


&nbsp;


No financial entanglement but movie tickets do cost money. Well, Cliff says he'll cover my movie ticker and that we'll sort our transportation. I think it's basically a forgone conclusion that if we see this movie that I'll be paying for the $10-$15 cab ride. Still pretty fair. Cliff doesn't like popcorn so if I buy an overpriced bucket of popcorn it'll all be mine! We will likely get candy ahead of time because it's cost effective to go that route and he's more than welcome to get what he wants for himself. If he pays for the cab ride in either or both directions, I wouldn't mind covering snacks from an outside store which I'd likely go to before the cab even picks us up so we don't have to make any stops.

&nbsp;


Overall this is a safer thing than going out to dinner or a bar, none of that ""oohph I forgot my wallet"" and if he doesn't allocate his pay day money towards the movie tickets then we simply don't go. In that regard the choice is his and it can go either way. As long as I'm not buying or using drugs, what could go wrong?

94sitp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/94sitp/dead_guy_carl/,24,https://redd.it/94sitp,ASavageLost,Dead Guy Carl,"## We were faithful practitioners of an antique religion. It originated in 19th century Asia, but a vein of revival made its way up from Mexico in the early nineteen nineties. Upon conversion, we sold all we had to follow our goddess. We lived for her, and in back alleys and hotel rooms all around the city, we built altars to her with blackened spoons, the bottom halves of aluminum cans, needles, empty cigarette boxes and the gnawed leather of looped belts.  These were the worn relics of our sacrament and liturgy. We practiced the ritual of cooking magical potions, conjuring up blissful sleep and vapor the smell of vinegar and brown sugar. We vomited and hiccupped as a rite of passage. Daily devoting ourselves, tying ourselves off, kneeling before her altar and letting blood from our arms. We were ready to sacrifice our first born if she asked.

## Heroin was life for us, and without her we were dead. Every heartbeat. Every thought. Every move. Every drop of gasoline in the car. Every cent we made. Every calorie we consumed. Every breath was devoted to the chase for more.

Four Hondurans started selling heroin and cocaine at five in the morning. They came like clockwork, because they got off the first bus that brought them to the park. Besides Chivo, it was the only other place we knew to get heroin in town, and it was the only place it was available at five a.m. Chivo started at eight, but sickness started early. They sold dimes, or ten dollars‚Äô worth, in tightly wrapped balls made from cut squares of trash bag. Black was heroine. White was cocaine. They sold five for 40 dollars as an incentive to buyers and allowed any combination.

We woke up before five, sick as usual. I gathered together the random CDs in the car and went to see if one of the Hondurans in the park would trade a dime of black for them. Roger was the one we knew best, but he laughed at my offer. He seemed annoyed. He would not even look at me.

We were out of luck, so we parked next to a Seven Eleven. In the car, we stretched and yawned. Our bodies ached, and the anxiety set in. We never knew where we would get it. We just had to have it. Watery snot and tears started, the sure signs of dope sickness.

‚ÄúWhat are we going to do, bubby?‚Äù Danielle lay back in the passenger seat.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, baby. I‚Äôm tired. We can call Chivo and ask for another front, or we can do something, but it‚Äôs too early to call Chivo. Let me chill for a minute. We‚Äôll get it. Don‚Äôt worry. I don‚Äôt know how but we will.‚Äù She always said she liked me better when I was sick. Heroine made me extremely mean and difficult. When I was sick, I felt exposed and sensitive. Television commercials brought tears to my eyes, and I was nice to her.

‚ÄúOK, bubby. I‚Äôm sick as s\*\*\*.‚Äù She held her stomach.

‚ÄúI know, baby. Me too.‚Äù I folded my arms and closed my eyes. My back and head ached. I pushed back into the driver‚Äôs seat. Not two minutes passed before we heard a knock on the window.

A strange individual tried to talk to us through the closed window. Thick glasses, a shaved head, orange freckles on pale skin, a gaunt face. Maybe a man. Maybe a lesbian. I tried to tell the person to wait till we rolled the window down, but they continued to talk. As the window lowered, I could hear he was a man.

‚ÄúI need a ride out of here! Right now! I‚Äôve got money! I‚Äôll pay you. I have to get out of this state!‚Äù He seemed genuinely desperate for our help. Through the window he flashed several bills, mostly ones and a five. It was good enough for me.

‚ÄúGet in!‚Äù

Danielle had to open her door to open the door for him to crawl into the back, and we took off.

‚ÄúWhere do you want to go?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know where he went. There was nothing in the back seat, but a pile of clothes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know! Anywhere, out of here!‚Äù His voice came from the clothes. He had buried himself in the pile of unfolded and dirty clothes.

‚ÄúWell, maybe you could give us a little more direction. If you pay, we‚Äôll take you anywhere you want.‚Äù I remembered the condition of my release from jail. My travels were not to exceed a 150-mile radius from there, but money was on the line. He never gave us a destination.

Traffic halted for miles on the interstate. It was from people headed to work, so we were stuck for a while. He talked about the people chasing him. They wanted to kill him, and the cops would send him to prison. He had spent the previous night jumping fences to escape. A day or two before that, he threw away several ounces in a hotel room of the casino, because he thought he was being set up. Danielle and I knew what he needed.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you let us get you some heroin? That‚Äôll calm you down. We can get a hotel room and get some brown. Hey, what‚Äôs your name anyway? If we are going to be helping you escape and partners in crime, we should know each other‚Äôs names.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Carl.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Riley. This is Danielle.‚Äù

He agreed that getting heroin was a good idea, so we pulled off at the next exit, and called Chivo. We found a Motel 6, and she checked into the room, for us. He snuck in while we waited for Chivo. We never had much money to score, so Chivo‚Äôs driver hurried to meet us at the gas station down the street. Out of the four 50-dollar balloons, Carl gave us three to share, which he did several more times. He always gave us three and kept one. It was Christmas morning, and we were little kids.

When Danielle and I got high, we bickered and said nasty things to one another, not as a matter of any real hurt or problems we had, but like an allergic reaction to the heroin. There were two or three days in a row of us sitting in a dark, cool Motel 6 room watching HBO high on heroin and Danielle and I squabbling. Carl spent time on his computer and whined about our fussing and fighting.

‚ÄúYou guys should love one another. You never know when you won‚Äôt have the other one with you again.‚Äù He whimpered. His life was hard, one of six boys, the youngest, and regularly raped by one of his brothers. His father hated him. He found love with an old man named Tony, who taught him the trade of stealing fine art, paintings and such. They were busted together and sent to different prisons where Tony died of AIDS, I guessed. Danielle and I thought Carl turned tricks off the Internet for the money he had, but we had no proof. On our third day together, he had us drop him off in the middle of nowhere, because he did not want to hear us fight. His countenance was quiet and depressed, and he wouldn‚Äôt make eye contact.

Danielle and I came back from trying to score all day at around 630 to find Carl outside of the room waiting for us. He got four balloons as usual, but this time he only gave us one and kept three. Then he gave us 20 bucks and sent us to Wendy‚Äôs to get some dinner.

Carl lay on the floor sweaty and flaccid by the time we got back to the room. A few slaps to the face and yells of his name proved he had overdosed. Danielle shrieked and flapped her hands at her face in fear, while I ran to the bathroom and saturated a hand towel with water. When I rung it out over his face and the water hit him he came to.

‚ÄúHey, mother f\*\*\*er, we‚Äôre calling 911! You need to go to the hospital!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt take his attempt at suicide personally. It was his prerogative far as I saw it, but overdosing himself in the hotel room where we slept was unacceptable.

‚ÄúNo! No! No! Don‚Äôt call the ambulance. I‚Äôm okay. I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù He begged us not to call. I listened to him, for some reason. Soon after all of it, I regretted not robbing him for all his money and sending him overdosed to the hospital. We would have been gone with his electronics and money before he got out of the hospital.

We feared that he would asphyxiate, so we made him sit up against the corner of the room on his bed while we watched TV. The blankets were around him, and she and I must have given cues that I was nodding out with our conversation. His eyes were closed, but he was awake.

‚ÄúSee? Riley is nodding out. Why doesn‚Äôt he have to go to the hospital?‚Äù

‚ÄúShut the f\*\*\* up, Carl. Or we will call 911 to come get your overdosing a\*\*.‚Äù It was 1030.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fair. You are as high as I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut the f\*\*\* up, Carl!‚Äù

He was snoring at 130 when I went to sleep. The Hangover played mute on the TV. Danielle woke me up at 10.

‚ÄúRiley. Riley. Wake up. I think he‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not dead.‚Äù I opened my eyes and looked at him. I was not so sure.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs dead, bubby! He looks dead!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. He‚Äôs not dead. Let‚Äôs find a rinse before we check.‚Äù

We found the bottom half of a coke can on a shelf below the TV. It had a spot of brown goo on the edge with a gray, shriveled cotton in the middle. It was all that was left of the three balloons he did the day before. I wondered how he even managed to get that much tar into a syringe and inject it while we were at Wendy‚Äôs. I thought he must have skin-popped it. It would have been several injections of black sludge, and if he had hit a vein the first one would have put him out.

We washed the bottom of the coke can with water and even sucked it through his old cotton. It was not the clean thing to do, but we didn‚Äôt care. She peed on the toilet and kept telling me he was dead while I split the syringes of slightly colored water. I denied it one more time before I hit a vein in her arm and then my own.

I walked out first and went over to his bed. I focused on his mouth and the strand of drool hanging from his chin. It was dried out and stuck there, the consistency of hair sprayed spider web. When I put my hand on his shoulder to shake him awake, I said, ‚ÄúCarl!‚Äù But he rolled over, cold and stiff. His legs never unfolded or changed position. The dried-out stalactite of drool stood upside down in the air, and his head hung off the bed. His eyes belonged on ice at the super market. They may as well have been a pair of yellow, lumpy grapes for all the life that they had in them.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead.‚Äù Danielle cried. I pulled him off the bed onto the floor. It only took a second for me to consider what money he might have on him and reached into the pocket of his shorts to find a black leather wallet. There were 250 dollars, so I took the two big bills and left the 50.

Danielle called 911 like we should have the night before. She said the operator said to give him mouth to mouth. One look at his dead mouth and the thought of the stale air trapped in his lungs settled it in my mind that I was not giving him mouth to mouth.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not giving him mouth to mouth!‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, Riley! Just try! Is he cold?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot cold, but he‚Äôs not warm. If you want to give him mouth to mouth get over here and do it. Or they can come do it, but I AM NOT doing it!‚Äù

She talked into the phone. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not completely cold. Is that a good thing? Is there a chance he might live?‚Äù She asked in tears and then turned to me. ‚ÄúShe says to put your mouth on his mouth and breath.‚Äù

‚ÄúHang up!‚Äù

We gathered the syringes and cookers and balloons and threw the in the dumpster at the back of the parking lot. We stepped outside as the fire truck pulled up. They quickly gave up on trying to resuscitate Carl‚Äôs dead body. One squad car pulled up, then another, and one more. A cop put up the yellow tape around the room, and they separated Danielle and me, to question us. She spoke so I could hear her, to get our stories to match up. The black cop dressed in blues flirted with her. She flirted back and told him she was a stripper. As I wrote a statement on the hot hood of a running squad car in the sun, I wondered how many years I could get for it. Would these be my last minutes of freedom scribbling and nervous on the hood of a cop car?

An unmarked car pulled up with two detectives. They wore jackets, slacks and ties and had personality. They slicked their black hair back true to their Hispanic heritage. One of them talked to me about the Hornets and mentioned the Nuggets. Sickly scents of pomade and cologne mixed with fear to turn my stomach. His partner walked around and talked to the policemen before he walked up to me.

‚ÄúLook. We got an overdose to go to right after this, two blocks away. Another dead body. We don‚Äôt have time for all of this. Where are the syringes and cookers? You don‚Äôt think he overdosed on air, do you? No. We don‚Äôt either. Now, we understand, you and your girlfriend got scared and hid all the stuff. But we need some evidence of his drug use. We need some syringes for evidence, and we‚Äôll get you two on your way. I promise.‚Äù

They took me to the dumpster where we tossed the stuff, and made me climb in, but I couldn‚Äôt find it. There were several empty 20 oz. bottles from another room with syringes in them. We never put our syringes in bottles like that, but the detective seemed satisfied.

‚ÄúOK. Grab a few and give them to me.‚Äù

They took some pictures and got our written statements. Things wrapped up, and the coroner came. A hearse came to pick up the body. It was obvious that one of the two men working for the company with the hearse enjoyed his job, maybe too much. He had a black three-piece suit and a felt top hat on, with a gold chain to a watch in his breast pocket. He wore a monocle. I didn‚Äôt know hearses picked up overdosed bodies out of hotel rooms, but that‚Äôs what I saw that day.

When they finally took the yellow police tape down and released us from the scene, she jumped into my arms and wrapped her legs around my waist. We shouted in glee and relief and made out in front of the last two cops on the scene. It was over, and we were free. I still had the 200 hundred dollars.

The first thing we did was call Chivo and met one of his guys at a gas station. When his driver showed up, I told him what happened. It didn‚Äôt really matter to him. They wanted the money. At some point in the day, I spilled the last of our heroin out of a cooker onto my khaki pants. She was mad, so we went to Home Depot. I tried to steal a bunch of copper wire, but on the way out of the door, loss prevention drove me to the ground so hard the scab on my knee had fabric from my pants in it and turned it green. Lock up smelled better than the last one, and they let me out after three days for petit theft.

A week later, the coroner called to ask what I knew about Carl. I told him what Carl told me, maybe it was true, maybe not, but it‚Äôs what he said. His tone of voice seemed bewildered over the phone. Sometime after that, on our way to Danielle‚Äôs first night stripping again, a strange figure riding a scooter pulled up next to us. Danielle and I looked over at a 55-year-old lesbian in a black leather cap and vest, thick glasses, orang freckles and pale face. Her hair was red and grey and buzzed off. Could it be Carl? It looked exactly like him. We laughed about when the 911 operator had instructed us to give him mouth to mouth.

I never felt much about robbing the dead man, or the fact that the last words he heard before he died were me telling him to, ‚Äúshut the f\*\*\* up.‚Äù There was no time to feel bad about it, when spilled hits of heroin and three days in jail were so disappointing. The only thing I ever thought about it was that I should have robbed him when he was overdosed and called the paramedics. It would have been less trouble for us.

I'm fairly new to opiates and use sparingly but recently i came across a big oxycodone chlorhydrate pills stash dosed between 5mg to 20mg

I started using 1 month ago sticking to the following schedule by starting each week with 1-2 pills and gradually ramping up to the numbers written in the below table by the middle of each week.

Week 1 : 4/5 5mg 21PM-6AM
Week 2 : 10 5mg / 24H
Week 3 : 6 10mg /24H
Week 4 : 4 20mg pills / 24H



Week | Consumption | Period of use
----|-----------|-------------
1 | 5 5mg pills | 21PM-6AM
2 | 10 5mg pills | /24H
3 | 6 10mg pills | /24H
4 | 4 20mg pills| /24H



I am at the end of week 4.
I still have 2 5mg pills, and 13 pills of morphine sulphate extended release.

24H after last use i feel some depressions and loss of motivation symptoms, i worked all day in euphoria during 2 weeks so i can see why suddenly everything seems harder to do.

Is there an exit strategy for me by using what is left to my disposal or even getting some more secable 5mg pills to plan a tapering off.

I thought that at first using the xr sulphate to stave off withdrawals during days and gradually decrease to 5mg pills then cut in half until i'm a step of soberity. I also have weed and psychedelics at my disposal. 
I could incorparate LSD Microdose and occasional weed to counter the symptoms. I also exercise in short 30mn session every day to supplement the dopamine supply.

What do you think would fit the plan ?",1533479709.0

‚ñ™I hardly pay attention to the body high anymore, explicitly enjoy the mental rest I get from dosing. Anyone else encounter this? Makes sense since that's what drew me in originally anyways

‚ñ™Pills and clear have cured me of binge drinking. I used to be drink heavily, OFTEN, sometimes for fun but sometimes just to bare it all. Was occasionally debilitating.Now I barely sip a drink if I come across one.

Feeling the withdrawals start kicking in.  It was a pretty normal night but half way down the free way I felt my stomach start rumbling and something start to creep out my asshole.  I was hoping it was just a fart and was trying desperately to hold it in.  There was so much pressure that started to build up down there and I was scared shitless.  

I knew I had to figure something out now before a shit volcano came out of me.  I took the next exit but in this part of town there was nothing.  nada.  But it was still very well urban.  There was no way I could even muster up the ability to take out my phone and find the nearest restroom.  It was that bad.

So I said ""Fuck it"".   I pulled into the next parking lot i saw, which was some type of bank I believe.  Drove into the parking spot and in record time I simultaneously opened my door, pulled down my pants, bent over, and literally exploded all over the bank parking lot.  I'm far from religious but I was praying to the great creator that security would not come (thankfully it didn't happen.  God that would've been extremely embarassing...)  The size of my pile looked like it belonged to a bovine.  It was crazy.  I'm also praying that they either don't see this pie or they think it's from some type of animal (which I highly doubt they'd think it would just be a squirrel or something) when they come in on Monday.  It's literally in front of the building ON one of the main parking spots.  Some employee can literally park and step out right onto this chocolate stew that will undoubtedly be cooking in 100 degree weather for over 36 hours.  I have a huge feeling they will look at the cameras and laugh at my dumbass and probably submit it to Youtube where I will be a laughing stock for a week.

So I didn't have any napkins or anything in my car and I was pissed.  Turns out there was a gas station right across the street.  I'm a dumbass.  Pulled up my pants and waddled over to the gas station to make sure my fresh shit ass doesn't touch my boxers and wiped myself off in the gas station bathroom.  I then got a soda, and of course the cashier tried asking me how my night's been.  ""shitty...""  and left.  15 minutes later I was high so that was cool.

Yes it was demoralizing but it felt ohhhhhhh so good when everything was said and done.

They should be smart enough to know that when someone goes into opiate withdrawal they get desperate and they go try to cop on the street or in the worst case scenario attempt suicide.

If the government truly cared about helping addicts and improving our current situation. They would make medication assisted therapy more accessible. They would allow maintenance drugs like methadone and suboxone to be prescribed by PCPs like other countries have done with great success. They would divert money from our bloated military budget and invest in community based addiction services. They would attempt to fix our deeply flawed for profit health care system.

He‚Äôs a monster. I hate him, and I‚Äôm not going to read the rest of this crap either.‚Äù

The payment for the eyeball was a half-ounce of the best heroin in town. I couldn‚Äôt turn that down. He was going to get his eyeball removed from him one way or another. It didn‚Äôt matter. If I didn‚Äôt do it, someone else would. Besides, there were promises made during the negotiations of the deal that Bug was in fact a very bad guy who had done some very bad things, to kids even. His boyish kimono wearing lover on the bed lent credibility to that idea.

As to accusations of me being a monster? I am. There‚Äôs no doubt. I would never deny that. They call me Boom Boom, and that‚Äôs not for nothing. And you‚Äôd be totally justified if you quit reading right now. I think the thing to do when writing is show yourself to be human and create some sort of empathy between yourself and the reader before dropping bombs of over-the-top and borderline unrealistic scenes of mindless violence on them. I think if you keep reading, though, you will appreciate the things I have to say and the story I have to tell.

So anyway, I had moved the eyeball from my pocket into an empty box of chocolate milk I found on a stoop after Rufus got hemmed up. It was a better container for the eye. Otherwise, it might have gotten crushed in my pocket and squeezed out whatever squeezes out of eyeballs when they get crushed in people‚Äôs pockets. I imagined clear jelly. I carried the carton in my hand as I walked and shook it from time to time, partly to make sure it was still in there and partly because I was fascinated by the sounds it made.

The sign above the shop said THE LAND OF ENCHANTMENT. That‚Äôs the nickname for the state of New Mexico, where Jimbo was supposedly from. I walked in. As usual, a white sage smudge stick smoldered on the counter by the register where Jimbo leaned on his elbows. The smoke always burned my eyes. Jimbo was always watching a box TV and trying to fix the antenna.

He jumped up and walked to meet me in the middle of the shop.

‚ÄúYou got it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Right here.‚Äù

Off in the corner his lover, Finnish Fin, sat on a beanbag chair red eyed and smoking a joint. He was fat and feminine but very nice. He smiled and held his hand out to say hello to me. At his feet lay two obese dalmatians. Their names were Sasha and Sabrina. They could barely walk.

‚ÄúGood! Good!‚Äù Jimbo said rubbing his hands. At that moment, my attention turned to the goiter on the side of his neck. It was always hard not to look at it, and as he opened the top of the carton to see into it, he asked me, ‚ÄúAre you looking at my goiter again?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure am, Jimbo.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, does it look any different?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah. Maybe like it‚Äôs hardening in some spots. Calcifying or whatever the hell it is goiters do.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo bad.‚Äù He said. He was completely engrossed with the task at hand.

Jimbo walked back behind the counter and pulled a plate out. He dumped the contents of the carton out, and apparently, there had been more chocolate milk in it than I‚Äôd thought. The eyeball plopped out in the middle of the shallow puddle with a wet smack. A translucent floatie moved around in the brown liquid next to it. The whole scene reminded me of every time I‚Äôd ever cracked an egg to scramble.

‚ÄúBoss man will be happy about this one! Fin, give it to him.‚Äù

The blond, pale skinned man on the bean bag chair reached into his coat pocket and produced several packages wrapped in butcher paper. He fumbled through them and threw one up in the air to me. I peeled the tape off and unrolled it. There was another layer of tinfoil but under that was a clear sandwich baggie holding the brown powder about thick around as a cigar. I held the package to my nose and inhaled. It smelled sort of like vinegar, but the best way to say what it smelled like is that it smelled like heroin. You know like when people eat something and say it tastes like chicken, but chicken is what really tastes like chicken. The weight in my hand smelled like heroin, good heroin. I was excited and said,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of works!‚Äù

‚ÄúHere, Boom Boom.‚Äù Fin stood up and pulled open a drawer. He produced a syringe and a cooker that even had the twist ties from the needle exchange and one of those blue water droppers. ‚ÄúUse the closet back here. The windows, you know?‚Äù He gestured towards the shop‚Äôs large windows. ‚ÄúOh ya, Boom Boom, be careful. That‚Äôs good stuff.‚Äù

I walked to the closet and found a bucket. I turned it over, rolled up my sleeve and sat down to fix it up. *You missed it, Rufus*. I thought. *Hopefully, I still have some when you get out.*",1533445778.0

From kind folk... thanks a lot Oklahoma.,"Oklahoma recently passed a bill that the government SWEARS will take care of the opioid crisis. One thing they're doing is controlling pain management. Every patient cannot be prescribed more than 90mg of morphine a day. So if someone is prescribed 2 40 oxymorphone and 3 oxy 10s (for breakthrough pain) a day , they have to be cut down to one oxymorphone. because that's the equivalent. And it has to happen fast. Patients are already starting to withdrawal and feel desperate. Doctors want to ween their patients slowly and as painless as possible but doctors are also trying to dodge getting sued by the state for ""over prescribing"". But some of these patients have major chronic pain and have had it for 5, 10, 20, 30 etc years and will continue with this pain. If you read about oxymorphone, it is an opioid made for those people who have been in pain management for years and the other meds have slowly stopped effecting them. My mother is one of those people. Going on 30 years and she's now in so much pain. She won't take more than prescribed but cutting down to less than half of her daily dose is just cruel. I could see this leading to more heroin ODs. If the government is set on doing this, give the doctors time to ween their patients before you start threatening to sue them. This is heartbreaking to see. And I wish my mom would let me try to find her extra so she could be comfortable but she's stubborn and a strict law abiding citizen. She won't take anything that isn't hers. What should I do? I don't know how to help her. I'm an addict and in sub treatment. I would say she could just give up and start getting off of it but she's fatally ill and in a lot of pain. So that's a no go. I wish Mary Fallin could come to my house and experience what my mom is going through. Maybe then her and her group of buttheads could get a better picture of what they're actually doing and maybe figure out what they need to do.",1533438474.0

I'm on 130 mg of methadone. What's going on?,"First of all, before I was on methadone, this literally NEVER ever happened.

Even when I was on a lowish to mid range dose (for me) of methadone it never happened.

So now I'm on 130mg.

I bought some dope from a guy and shot my usual dose (like .5 gram) and immediately I had the worst most suicide-inducing headache ever.

I suffer from SEVERE chronic pain. This was LITERALLY the worst fucking pain I've ever been in by far. I couldn't even think enough to operate my phone. I barely had the ability to swallow a fistful of xanax and ibuprofen to try to stop it. If my condo would have been on the top floor I would have thrown myself off without hesitation (and no, I'm not suicidal).

Here's what happened.

After the shot, I got no rush, just an extremely irritating reaction feeling. Then I slowly felt my heartbeat start to crawl upwards towards my head. The beating then landed in the back of my head and this super-migraine-on-steroids started to beat exactly in rhythm with my heart. It felt like there was massive pressure in my skull and that an artery in my brain was about to explode, beating in perfect unison with my heart. Everytime my heart made a beat, the pressure caused an extreme wave of incapacitating pain. Imagine everytime your heart beat, the pressure in the back of your head shot up to 10,000 psi and caused the most torturous pain imaginable. It was absolutely dreadful.

Eventually after 30 minutes of literally bashing my head into a wall and screaming into a pillow like a wild animal, it began to subside.

I immediately texted this dealer, told him what happened, and said there must be something in his cut that is causing this.

He said it hadn't happened to anyone else including him.

I figured he was full of shit and never bought from him again.

Well, it turns out he was right.

Long story short, everytime I would do even a slightly moderate amount of any dope, from any source, IV, this would happen again.

The thing is, I could snort as much as I wanted and this wouldn't happen.

I could even IV as much as I want - so long as I didn't do too much in one shot - and this wouldn't happen.

It only happens when I IV above a certain amount in a single shot.

So yeah, I figured it was my methadone dose and I decided to do only very small shots for 3 days (about 72 hours) until the methadone was out of my system (or at least most of it, I hope).

So after 72 hours after last taking my 130mg of methadone, I doubled my h dose and took a dose that would normally have caused a headache, and it didn't.

I was too afraid to push the dose any higher than that, and I had to go back to the clinic the next day anyway, and would have no choice but to dose methadone.

So yeah, in conclusion, sorry about the long essay lol.

Basically, on my current 130mg dose of methadone, if I shoot even a slightly too large small shot of IV heroin all at once in the same shot, I get literally the worst migraine headache imaginable that would make anyone want to eat a 12 gauge. If I wait about 3 days, I can do a larger shot, but I haven't tried doing anything close to my regular dose.

By the way, as far as my tolerance goes, it's massive. As long as I spread out the doses, I avoid the headache, and have done well over a gram of fire IV and was still fully awake.

So anyways. What I was wondering is.

What do you think is going on? Has anyone ever had an experience like this, with or without methadone and/or any other drug(s)?

If you were in my situation, hypothetically, how long would you wait after last dosing methadone before taking h? After the methadone break, how much h would you do relative to the last h dose that did not cause a headache? Basically how long would you wait after the methadone and how slow would you taper the h dose up and at what dose would you no longer increase it?

Thank you for reading this everyone. I truly appreciate it.

## Danielle PART 2 

## 

## Violent and otherwise destructive behavior was a defense mechanism, necessary to maintain a life of ruthless drug addiction in the streets. It was the unsurprising side effect of a cold and calloused heart, which had no room for things like sentimentality or love. Those things make a person weak and vulnerable in a world where dogs eat dogs, and even mothers eat their children. That may sound extreme, but that is how it was to me. That is how I saw it. If I would sell myself for drugs, plunge a blade into my stomach, steal my grandmother‚Äôs jewelry or subject myself to the harsh reality of the streets day in and day out, what would stop me from doing the same to you? Nothing.

## We told everyone we were in love, but love was impossible for people like us. What we really had were attempts to fill our lives‚Äô emotional voids with each other and chemical imbalances in our brains that manifested themselves as romantic fantasy. In a very short time we became very close. Probably because we spent every second of every day together, and every day tried us.

## Somewhere in her head, I was half baby and half bunny like her beloved Bunny O‚ÄôReilly from childhood. Her mom had inadvertently programmed her to love that name, and her father programmed her to love men that were no good to her, even though he was pretty good to her when I knew her. I fit the bill. Half bunny and half baby, she called me bubby when I was capable of compassion, but when I had heroin eyes and the hiccups she just called me Clyde.

‚ÄúHey Clyde! How come you never call me Bonnie?‚Äù

‚ÄúCuz your name ain‚Äôt Bonnie!‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what? A Clyde ain‚Äôt nothing without a Bonnie. Just like you ain‚Äôt nothing without me. You‚Äôre my Clyde. I want to be your Bonnie.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are my Bonnie, baby! But, that ain‚Äôt your name. You know how I am. It‚Äôs like you wanting me to speak Spanish to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah! I want you to call me Bonnie, and I want you to speak Spanish to me!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat am I supposed to do? Have conversations with myself? You can‚Äôt even understand it. That‚Äôs weird. Like calling you Bonnie.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what? Call me Bonnie, Clyde! Speak Spanish to me! It‚Äôs sexy!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah right! You‚Äôre name ain‚Äôt Bonnie, and you don‚Äôt speak Spanish! Now, drop it!‚Äù

The trajectory and momentum of my life scared people before she came around, but now it was a 20-pound cannon ball ripping through the air about to smash anyone and anything that got in its way, even her. Instead of one, now a couple of drug dealers wanted to kill me. Most junkies wanted to beat me up, and at least one cop promised to send me to prison the next time she found me. But, the real reason we left town was that the heroin was no good since Vanessa and Smokey got busted, and Danielle said she could make big bucks stripping in the City.

Eight miles north of town, heading to Colorado, a friend of ours called me up and asked if we could score for a kid who was new to town at the homeless shelter. We came over. The kid sniffled and his eyes watered when he yawned. He was sick for sure, so we said we would pick up from Joe and be right back. But we drove to the city after we scored from Joe. Our friend called to tell us that we were disgusting pieces of trash, and he was right. We departed in the grainy black and white of a 1930s movie house featuring Bela Lugosi as Dracula. We were some mad scientist‚Äôs undead creatures fleeing to the hills from an angry mob of town folk with their pitchforks and torches.

That first week in the city is mostly a blur. Somehow, we got a hold of some speed and slunk up and down the street in the Camry, suspicious as they get, at all hours of the morning, but the cops never bothered us for it. At a 24-hour donut shop, we took the two dollars and 39 cents out of the tip jar. It must have been early in the month when her SSI check came in, because we were in and out of adult novelty shops across the city buying all kinds of stuff and even had a hotel room. We made connections with new dealers, and let some homeless guy videotape us having sex in a hotel room one night. I stole a pair of stilettos for her, but there was something we had to take care of before she could start stripping.

Not long before we left town I missed an injection and deposited the warm, dirt water of a rinse into the muscle of her forearm. She was thin. Her veins rolled a lot, and she moved around when I dug in her arm trying to register blood. The miss turned into an abscess the size of a golf ball, so we took matters into our own hands in a hotel room.

We stole a pack of shaving razors, a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, some gauze and tape. I broke the thin blade out of one of the shavers and snapped it in half. In the poorly lit bathroom she stood in the tub, while I knelt on the floor outside of it. Danielle shook, and her lips curled in distress. With her right wrist in my left hand I looked at her and said with a smile,

‚ÄúNow baby, I know that I look like one, but I feel like I should tell you that I‚Äôm not actually a doctor.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up! It‚Äôs not funny! Now hurry up!‚Äù

I pushed the sharp side of the blade into the thin, yellowed skin on the head of her abscess. A snake of black blood and green puss slithered down her arm and thudded in clumps on the floor by the drain. She recoiled, but I held her wrist and pulled her back.

‚ÄúNow, we have to squeeze it.‚Äù I pinched her flesh on either side of the bleeding wound and squeezed it. More blood and puss oozed out. Her body shuddered, and she groaned curse words. We were high on heroin, but it didn‚Äôt make much difference for her. It was painful. I poked a hole into the top of the bottle of peroxide and sprayed a jet of the fluid into her wound. It fizzed and foamed on the blood.

‚ÄúOkay. That should be good.‚Äù We wrapped it in gauze and taped it up and went to sleep.

The next night we went up to The Bus Stop to get her job at the strip club back. After 15 minutes of waiting in the car, she walked out fuming and cursing back at one of the bouncers, and he screamed from across the parking lot that she was a junkie whore. They did not want her back with a bandage on her arm like that. So we headed back home.

I wasn‚Äôt afraid of the death threats there, because if there was anything I knew about back home, it was that no one‚Äôs word was worth much. The people who wanted to kill me would have to find me first, and even if they did, they would have to deal with me when they did. I‚Äôm not saying that they weren‚Äôt dangerous people. They were, but what I am saying is that when it came down to it, so was I.

30 minutes out of the city a blizzard blinded us, and snow covered the interstate. The radio played. The heater warmed the car. She sat naked in the passenger seat, and my hand rested between her legs when the car spun off the road. The car did a few 360s on the highway, before we slid down the embankment of the median. In two minutes a cop came to help us, so she put on a jacket and rolled down the window. He told us to get off the road once he helped us get back onto it. We stopped at the rest stop a few miles up the highway and spent the night.

When we woke up, it was light and the roads were safe. I found the ten-dollar bag of heroin we lost under the seat the night before and split it with her. It was the last of what we bought for a guy that sent us 100 dollars from home a few days before. He thought we would bring him some back some heroin from the city, but now it was all gone.

‚ÄúWhat do you think, baby? It‚Äôs a four-hour ride back home, and the dope‚Äôs no good there.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, bubby. I know. Let‚Äôs go back to the city.‚Äù",1533435599.0

The amount of opiates on one poppy isn't enough to kill something like a human but more then enough to kill bugs, a defense that kept them safe for a while. That's why when you slit them that milky substance mostly comprised of morphine will slowly ooze out of the hole.


Of course animals found them then eventually humans who took them to another level after they discovered a non lethal dose is fucking awesome but I love the fact the whole reason it exists is a defense against predators.",1533430508.0

## Danielle PART 1 

## 

## 

## The scars on my neck belong to her. Two cigarette burns, perfectly round and white, sit two inches below my ears where Frankenstein‚Äôs creature had his bolts. I see them every time I shave, and they remind me of hard days with my girl. Her name was Danielle, but I just called her baby.

## In the middle of our arguments we screamed in one another‚Äôs faces. Sometimes, I cleared my throat and hawked phlegm into her eyes, and she spat back into mine. We tried to blow each other away with the spray of verbal buckshot until there was nothing left of us. Ten minutes later we made love on the bed or the back seat of the Camry and found something or someone to rob. It was a game we played, and it was killing both of us.

The first time I met her, her boyfriend lay on the floor of my apartment trembling and bleeding through his pants. My drug dealers pulled him out of her Camry on the south side of town and stabbed him in the knee for trying to go around me and deal with them directly. It didn‚Äôt work out for him, thus the crying and bleeding on my floor.

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you Riley?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. You must be Danielle.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure am.‚Äù She dropped his head to put her hand out.

‚ÄúGood to finally meet you.‚Äù I smiled and pinched her fingers.

I was seeing a different girl at the time, a 19-year-old red head who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over hours before she left her house, but that morning in my apartment, the look in Danielle‚Äôs eye told me it was only a matter of time before we got together. Never mind Mike and the red head.

Danielle and Mike used to come over every day before three to laugh at me for nodding out and looking like Teen Wolf. She always tried to get alone with me, but we didn‚Äôt hook up until after Mike started beating her again and I spent two weeks locked up, promising myself and everyone else that I would never do heroin again.

Mike took the battery out of her car and held her against her will in a trailer on the Mesa while I sat in jail. Then he passed out one afternoon after he put the battery back in, and she made her escape. Half an hour later, I called her from the payphone outside of the jail, and our reign of terror began.

I should tell you that this is the part of the story where you might want to stop reading. On the next page or so, I‚Äôm going to sell a guy a bag of dirt for 40 dollars and turn his face into hamburger meat before I hold him hostage in his bedroom for the night. My girlfriend will beg me to infect her with the Hepatitis C virus, and I will try. A few pages after that, I will rob a dead man, so if you‚Äôre not with all that or don‚Äôt understand that we were in a bad way, this is a good time to stop reading.

One of the only three heroin dealers in town fronted us packages of dope, and we came back with the money every night. He fronted us more, and we returned with more cash. Then he gave us a half-ounce, but we never came back. He offered anyone in town a 50-dollar bag for our whereabouts and left promises to murder me on her voicemail. We ripped off other junkies. They hated us. We stole merchandise and food from businesses. The owners and employees hated us. Several cops in town knew that I was driving the Camry and that I had a girlfriend. They hated us too, but we hated each other most of all.

Danielle had a monthly prescription for 90 Colonopin and a SSI check. Both were available on the first of the month, and we shot so much dope and took so many pills the first week of the month that our only friend quit hanging out with us. When her orange pill bottle quit rattling and the check was spent, anxiety wrought havoc. More than once she left me at the gas station and freezing at three in the morning while I was buying cigarettes and drove by a few times, screaming and giving me the finger for no reason. Later in the night we would go to the ER looking for meds.

Her Camry became our home. We cleaned out the ashtray at the casino several times a day and listened to Depeche Mode and Seminole Wind by John Anderson. Our diet consisted entirely of Wendy‚Äôs spicy chicken nuggets and Baja Blast. She made me give her a shot of dope visibly mixed with my own blood to intentionally contract Hepatitis C. That way I could no longer use contamination as an excuse for why I wouldn‚Äôt share a hit or a rinse with her. One afternoon I pulled over on the side of the highway and proposed to her with her own wooden ring. She said yes and we made out like two outlaws in love.

A lot of guys liked her. One of them lived in a nice apartment his parents paid for. His name was Justin. Now I forget what he said, but it made me mad. Then he gave us 40 bucks to go score, so she and I split it between us and put dirt in his bag. He called to complain, but we quit answering the phone. Later that night, I decided we should sleep at his place, so I parked in his parking lot and told her,

‚ÄúGet all of our blankets and meet me at the front door, baby.‚Äù

As I walked through the cobblestone courtyard of the adobe apartment complex, I wondered how mad he was and thought of what I was about to do. I fingered the baggie in my pocket. At his front door breath billowed out of my mouth, and the raps of my knuckles on his door bit cold into my bones. I put my hand back into my pocket and waited. The television played on the other side of the door. He opened it, but the chain only allowed a few inches.

‚ÄúWho is that? Riley? What do you want? I ought to mess you up for selling me dirt! Get out of here!‚Äù The interior light of his apartment poured out yellow through the crack in the door. It looked warm and comfortable.

‚ÄúI know. I know. Listen. I got something here, to make up for it.‚Äù I moved my arm and hand in my pocket, to indicate it was in my pocket. ‚ÄúOpen up, so I can show you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù The door closed momentarily while the chain latch came off. The knob turned. I grabbed it and lodged myself in the doorframe so he couldn‚Äôt close it. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? You can‚Äôt stay here! Why does she have blankets? Dude, what the f\*\*\*? Seriously?‚Äù A pile of blankets with Danielle‚Äôs legs bounced through the courtyard towards us. I made sure she got in before I let him shut the door.

She threw the blankets on the shag rug in front of his TV. He whined in the kitchen and flapped his arms, but we disregarded him until we had settled in and felt ready to address him. His accusations were mostly accurate, except when he said we didn‚Äôt have any heroin. We did, but not for him.

After she and I situated things, I showed him the 20-dollar bag we had. It was enough to shut him up, because we promised to share. We told him we would split it three ways, but in the bathroom, she and I split it down the middle. Afterwards, we rinsed the spoon and cotton filter a few more times, until all that was left was dirt and ash in the spoon. Then we sucked it up and came out of the bathroom to give it to him. He happily took the syringe full of dirty water and never accused us of anything until we hid ourselves in the bathroom again.

Danielle had her pants down, and I sat on the toilet applying cortisone cream to a patch of eczema on her rear end and thigh. She leaned over the sink. The door was locked while I took care of my baby.

‚ÄúOpen up. I know you‚Äôre in there doing more! Open up! You pieces of s\*\*\*!‚Äù The door shook as he pounded. ‚ÄúOpen up! Open the f\*\*\*ing door!‚Äù The door hit her in the head when he kicked it in.

My hands ripped the cedar towel rack out of the wall, before I could think. I beat him back out of the bathroom and side-to-side, across the living room with the wooden rod. A symphony of rage blared out of me and into my opponent. I was the impassioned composer of a brutal work, wildly conducting an orchestra of fingers, fists and arms. He tripped and fell backwards over his coffee table and couch.

My shirt was off and sweat was dripping when I threw the rod at his face. He could have it, because I owned him now. I leapt onto his chest for the crescendo of my opus and went to work. I pinned his arms under my legs. Bare knuckles bloodied themselves on his cheeks, and his face turned side to side with each punch. Snot and blood leaked from his mouth and nose, and he squealed as I stopped to catch my breath.

‚ÄúPlease, stop! Please! Please!‚Äù My teeth bit into my bottom lip. I looked at him for a second with my fist cocked back, before I tried to drive it through the back of his skull. His face was swollen and discolored and bloody.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you get for messing with my girl.‚Äù I thought and jumped up to grab the biggest butcher knife in the kitchen. About 10 inches of blade shined in the living room light.

‚ÄúI will f***ing kill you! You piece of s***! I will f***ing gut you! You f***ing hear me?‚Äù The F word constituted about one of every ten of my words back then! ‚ÄúGet in your room and give me your cell phone! You can come out in the morning, when she and I are done. You hear me, you f***ing piece of s***? Come out of the room, and I will stick this f***ing knife in your throat! Your guts will be all over this f***ing floor! You f\*\*\*ing hear me?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt say anything. He gave me his phone and held his face as he walked into his room. People around town always told me that he was a fighter. Supposedly he stood up to Diablo once and even ‚Äúgave him a run for his money.‚Äù Everyone always said he was tough, but not that night.

Danielle and I made a bed on the floor out of our blankets. She pulled up some pornography on his phone. Whatever meth we did the day before was too strong and the heroin was too weak to get us to sleep, so we had sex on and off throughout the night. Sometimes, I smoked cigarettes and tried to write poetry on pieces of cardboard box. She played dress up with some clothes that she had brought in. Later in the night she said something that hurt my feelings, so I used the scissors in my hand to stab myself in the leg a few times, but as daylight broke there was forgiveness and more sex. We defiled his toothbrush before we left, but I can‚Äôt remember why.",1533424728.0

It's shitty only being able to get off with the help of someone. I'll just keep studying him and working on getting these veins to pop. 

My veins are hard to see from me being on the chubby side. I'm successfully getting into shape, I stay hydrated and take warm showers, but they stay hidden. 
They're easy to find by feeling, and my boyfriend can hit them without fail, but I basically turn myself into a pincushion when I'm by myself. Ive tried all over arms and hands, at different angles, and can't see what I'm doing wrong. I'll think I'm in a vein, but can't register. I must be getting the angles wrong? I even try the ones on my hands and wrists that are visible. 

What have people found helpful when struggling to hit a vein that they know is there? 

This wouldn't be so frustrating if I could get anything out of just plugging it when I can't bang it. But when I plug, even when I'm empty, I get a fraction (if anything) of what I know I should get. 
I know I'm plugging correctly, I just don't get much out of it. 

anyone else out there not able to get a lot out of plugging?

Dead simple. Major car accident at 17, painkillers all her life, gets cut off lately because politics and doctor shopping, tons of weed always, and a surprisingly large alcohol intake with the painkillers. Multiple stomach surgeries from painkillers (and alcohol...and APAP because she gets pills from overseas and swallows anything she can get her hands on...). I suffered a major spinal injury roughly 8 years ago and 2 years ago was put on pain meds. This was the start of my problems, as she coached me and told me exactly what to say to get ""what I needed"". When I couldn't handle the meds and wasn't getting better I started giving her some of my meds. It's a really long and complex story but she manipulated me for a year and a half and lied and told me so much bullshit and eventually I was pulled off my meds for weed. This was a good thing because I was fucking done with the meds. And then my mom told me to stop smoking and go back to get the pills. I knew what was happening at that point. She was using me for drugs. Cut to a suicidal cold turkey and them taking the rest of my meds. She adopted the mentality that ""if she paid for it it's hers"" which is just stupid.      
      
Over a year and a half later every single pill is gone, or ""in a safety deposit box"" according to my brother who goes as far as bringing pills back from Europe for her twice now and saying nothing as she takes mine and the dogs meds without a single recourse. And what's more I found out she was totally getting scripts when I was giving her my pills. So many red flags my entire life, it's unreal. She is, and has been, a raging polysubstance addict for her whole life as far as I can gather.                
           
Cut to today.        
       
An explosive argument took place when yet another one of my scripts which my mom ""took away from me because I was suicidal"" happened to just ""disappear"" (which is script #8 which is never to been seen again), and suddenly after calling my mom out for stealing my meds, both of my brothers started backing me into a corner and screaming to get in my room.       
       
It was like a fucking movie. They all started approaching from all sides as my mom stood there in her doorway looking on, backing up their threats of physical violence. They both started telling me to shut the fuck up and get back in my room and they were clearly intimidating me as they stared me down with all the daddy issues they could muster.               
         
You see, my father was a bipolar maniac, and he accused my mother of being a drug addict. And we got the bad man out of the household leaving just my prestine and flawless mother who never did anything wrong in her life and totally isn't exactly like our father in a manipulative, compulsive lying, and narcissistic controlling manner!         
       
And the best part, if my brothers beat the shit out of me for calling her a drug addict, they didn't actually do anything wrong, and they can take their daddy/anger issues out and feel like a big man all at once!        
         
 
I stood in the doorway looking down the little brother who hasn't outright assaulted me yet, just kicked a chair out from under me with the force of a thousand daddy issues, while my older brother was standing at the top of the stairs telling me to shut the fuck up as I ranted and raved about my junkie fucking mother who keeps stealing my medications for 2 fucking years now.        
        
I said to my little brother ""what are you going to do, fucking hit my like he did?"" Referring to the fact that my older brother assaulted me and chased me around the house exactly one year ago for the exact same situation, except last time it was 2 bottles of muscle relaxers which she gobbled in a month (strong ones too...and she drank nearly every day. I don't know how it took my so long to put the pieces together).       
       
As he (older brother a year ago) pushed me back through the hallway he screamed with even daddier issues ""I. WILL. ALWAYS. DEFEND. HER. NO. MATTER. WHAT."" Then backed me into my room and started throwing my shit  against the wall like a fucking anger issue poster child as he intimidated me for a half  hour. This culminated in him grabbing me me by my collar of my hoodie as I tried to run past him and  him extremely forcefully yanking me around a corner of my doorframe. He left large red marks on my neck which I photographed. I have a fucking spinal injury, documented well, no doubt by doctors, but my mother has them all convinced I'm just exaggerating for drugs. How ironic. And funnily enough, she was 1000% supportive until I called her a drug addict. She turned on a dime from supporting me and understanding my disability to completely trying to slander me and set me up for failure in any way possible. Because if I fuck up she can say ""You pick up!"" If I fail a class, even though I know I needed to be hospitalized 6 months prior to the semester starting and me having ample time to withdraw, ""you fail classes!"". I had a temp job which ended over the summer, so now it's ""you lose jobs!"". It gets more manipulative, she tells me everyone thinks I'm going to fail and that every single thing I accomplished is because of her and all my failures are completely my own. Sigh.            
         
So being yanked around a corner was unbelievable pain to say the least, and they knew that. A month of my life was spent bedridden for that fucking abusive piece of shit. I have not spoken a single word to my older brother since this incident, and immediately after he got violent I told him he was an abusive piece of shit over and over and outright accused him of being abusive to his girlfriend (which there are MANY red flags to say the least). This is where it gets juicy.      
      
(Again, still the a year ago incident). My older brother came back 20 minutes later outside my door crying about how ""you were suicidal (a fucking year prior to this assault) and nobody knew what to do"". I immediately called him out because he was the worst fake cryer I've ever heard (and he's legit a fucking actor so, yeah...sad), and told him to fuck off and go sort out his daddy issues.         
           
(Flashing forward to today).       
     
My older brother said ""if you don't shut the fuck up I will assault you again"". I didn't feel like pulling the cop card, because at this point I don't have any illegal drugs, and I'm sure they assumed I did, but it would be the final nail in the coffin and officially burn the bridge. Last year when I threatened to call the cops on my physically abusive brother I had weed so of course I didn't. Now it's only mom with the illegal drugs. If I called the cops at very least she's going to jail for my scripts and a shitton of weed and pills. And my brother would go too if I showed them the video which I've now setup on a security camera so I won't miss it this time. If they lay a fucking hand on me I'm calling the cops. And my brother will go to jail like the physically abusive piece of shit he is.              
         
I don't even know how to respond. I packed all my shit and I'm leaving as soon as humanly possible on a Trailways bus and staying in a motel/hotel until college starts back up in less than a month. I don't know how I'm dealing with the money, but that's the only thing. It's all set. Fuck this fucked up junkie apologist household.      
        
Fun fact, my little brother goes to the same college, so that'll be fun. I hate him and all of his stupid fucking friends and I can't wait to never talk to him ever again. He just screamed through the door that I'm a ""wannabe cripple"" so that's just the best start to a semester I could ask for! Glad he takes mommy's word as gospel.            
       
I'm more mentally together than any of those fucked up people. They're all completely under my mom's spell and will buy anything she says. So when I became ""not actually disabled and actually just a junkie piece of shit who wants to call mom a junkie so he can get away with taking a ton of drugs"", it became fact in their eyes. And they can treat me like shit, because now I'm the bad man who needs to be removed to Mommy can do all the drugs and have no one say shit about it. I don't know how you can defend someone who drinks on pills as the rule, not the exception. Who steals prescriptions, who does anything to get pain meds, who has been unemployed effectively for decades, who is a manipulative piece of shit junkie bitch who just needs to fucking overdose already.

Arnold had to cut me off one month when I had ‚Äúcome undone‚Äù a bit and he knew where I was headed. He always kept such a close eye on my use. I think it was because he felt guilty for being my source. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to sell or trade my oxys for a while. I need to take them more now I think.‚Äù I got a sick feeling in my gut. ‚ÄúWell, I understand that man. Does that mean you don‚Äôt have any extra right now you can toss me?‚Äù His face softened. He had a hard time telling me no. ‚ÄúI only have four. I have these alprazalom though. I read on the computer the other day it helps people get clean from pain pills. You can take a few and see what you think.‚Äù 

I was familiar with the term Xanax but not really sure what the drugs did. I liked opiates. Never had any reason to try other things once I found my love. ‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôll take a few and see how I fare.‚Äù I pocketed like twenty blue footballs and my four oxy tens. Purple I think they might‚Äôve been? It‚Äôs been so long since I thought about anything before an OC 30. Anyway, I start my next week out knowing I had to get clean again. Shit. 

Four days had passed when I finally got out of that benzo fog. Those alprazalom mother fuckers caused me to wreck my step moms car, get arrested and bailed out of jails for only possession of marijuana because thankfully I had run out of pills. My friend named Dawn showed up to the little one horse county jail I was sitting outside of. ‚ÄúTake me to Arnold‚Äôs.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay girl, you got it. I‚Äôm not judging you at all. I know you‚Äôre going through some shit but I got your back. You can use my dads truck since you fucked up your step moms car last night. Omg have you even talked to them yet?!‚Äù 

Man Dawn was such a great friend. We had only been friends for a few months but she just loved me and my recklessness. She had a few kids and a lot of help from her family. Her old man got killed on a drilling rig so she was set for life. She was so good to me the year I spent in the Alps. I still can‚Äôt believe she is still my friend. ‚ÄúHey let‚Äôs stop and get Chinese on the way to Arnold‚Äôs yeah? I‚Äôm starving girl and I‚Äôm sure you are too.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSure babe, sounds great. I‚Äôm not hungry at all but let me buy your lunch for coming and getting my ass.‚Äù  

I sheepishly slide out of Dawn‚Äôs suburban and go up to the camera I had just installed to show my stupid face. I went inside. Arnold had posted my bond the night before but I had to stay there because he couldn‚Äôt drive to come get me. My own father declined to come get me the forty minutes away from his home and young blonde wife. ‚ÄúWhat kind of bird doesn‚Äôt fly?‚Äù I had a dumb and sad look on my face. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fucking know Arnold. What kind?‚Äù ‚ÄúA jailbird.‚Äù He was smiling at me when I glanced up from my formidable sadness. ‚ÄúFuck. You. Arnold.‚Äù 

We sit and smoke a joint and discuss the fact that it‚Äôs because I was cute was the reason Barney over in Mayberry didn‚Äôt go ahead and give me a DUI. ‚ÄúWas he nice to you?‚Äù Arnold‚Äôs voice creaked at me after the joint was long gone. ‚ÄúYeah he really was. I think he knows Tim too. He used to run around over in that area a lot and that cop couldn‚Äôt have been much more than a year or two older than Tim. Either way thanks for paying my bond. I didn‚Äôt even take a mugshot dude!‚Äù Arnold just grins and stares at me. I‚Äôm a mess. 

My icy blonde hair was still teased in the back but completely matted to the left side of my face from sleep earlier that morning in that tiny ass jail. I had one set of fake lashes still glued on but one set was long gone before I even went to jail that night. ‚ÄúWhy did you glue on fake eyelashes?‚Äù I was caught off guard by Arnold‚Äôs personal question. ‚ÄúWell I mean I thought they would make me look prettier or something. I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I was embarrassed by his question and pulled the remaining set off with my back turned to him. 

What the fuck did I put those on for anyways? I probably look like a walking parody of myself. ‚ÄúArnold, I ain‚Äôt takin them alprazaloms anymore. Let me know if and when you get some extra oxys. For now I‚Äôm sticking to weed only. Fuck those alprazaloms hard man.‚Äù  ",1533404465.0

Especially as a young vet, sometimes I wish I didn't sign up and end up so fucked up.

In the end I ended up getting put on methadone, after switching between a lot of different meds, first was Oxy IR and SR(with naloxone) ended up on 80mg SR/day and 20mg IR/day. Then got moved between Bupe patches, Tapentadol (Palexia) which did nothing for me, Hydromorphone which is when I first started using a needle and damn was that good, then finally onto Methadone, where I am now.   
Now 40mg of Methadone a day with 15mg of oxy a day as IR. Take home meth tablets 30 days supply at a time. I've personally been up and down on my dose, not so much up, til recently, but tried cutting back every now and then which would last a a month or two. The best I got to was 20mg meth and no oxy. Recently pain, depression, sleep, PTSD got really bad and I was using a lot more than my prescribed dose, and so ended up running out, although, perhaps luckily, or not, I didn't runout before I started to drop my dose quite drastically to get it last longer, which has probably helped even only if it was for 5 days or so. About 24 hours after my last dose the WDs start kicking in, which at least helps me believe at least I was cutting down quite a bit, because I used to be able to go 2 days/48 hours after my last dose on my normal dose.

Luckily I scored some Suboxone for times like these, and also for when I choose to get off the stuff. Anyway I had looked up a while a go what the short term sub dosing for WDs was, and found an Australian recommended inpatient dosing regiment over 5 days for dealing with Heroin WDs. And they have links to studies, and found that as long as dosing is done for 5 days or less then it should help to alleviate WD without lengthening it, or delaying it. It does require you to get down to a certain dose beforehand. The dosing starts at 8mg a day (2 x 4mg) and goes down to 2mg a day on day 5. 
 
I did 1mg sub yesterday, when WDs were bad, this was my first dose, and whilst it didn't completely alleviate the symptoms, it made it a lot more bearable. I lasted 24 hours before I couldn't do it any longer and I dosed 2mg, and I whilst they aren't completely gone I feel a lot better, and almost normal, still have some craving and weird temperature fluctuations, but no more sweating, eye watering, RLS, irritability etc. and I figure, it will be better for me to go through some of it now, as it means I'm taking less than I need, and so tolerance is decreasing

I'm going to try only 1mg tomorrow, and if needed either another 1mg, or 0.5mg on day 4. Then hopefully I don't need anymore. I can deal with some discomfort, and pain. I do it on a daily basis. The pain is very bad, but I've somehow convinced myself its better than continuing on the path I'm on.

I get new scripts of methadone and oxy on Thursday or Friday, so lets hope I don't fall back off if I get there.

Day 2 down, preparing for sleep, one or 2 days max left.


tl;dr after years of chronic pain and opiates, after running out early, I'm using bupe to get through WD's and will try to stay off the stuff, although maybe just enough to reset my tolerance",1533404203.0

My guess is pyramid scheme, bed bug cult invite or some kind of errand.


I can't imagine there being anything in it for me unless there's an input required of me. Like if he asks for money while offering me an opportunity then perhaps in his mind he thinks he isn't actually asking for anything.

&nbsp;

Perhaps he realized that I'm truly done with his bullshit and he's hashing a scheme to screw me over since he won't have to worry about me distancing myself from him as a consequence since I already have.

&nbsp;

Could it be a last ditch effort on his part or am I just paranoid? Gosh, I don't really want to find out. I'm curious but I don't really mind not knowing as long he doesn't bother me.


Maybe I'm just being paranoid?",1533365132.0

Opiates is my love, then benzos, then the otc stuff(kratom, phenibut, and at one point loperamide). Ive been on suboxone and methadone. The longest sobriety time ive had was 18 months. 

I think for hopeless addicts like me, its time to think out the box. Whenever i do get clean, I am a miserable human being for 6 months minimum. Idk if its paws or if im suffering from depression. I can't take anti depressants, they make me crazy! 

So far it seems that daily kratom use works best for me...do you guys think kratom use for maintenece after hard drug abuse is accepted? 

I mean, i worked the 12 step program many times thoroughly......but still feel empty. 

Idk, i want to get clean and be happy. I'm truely miserable when im using. So i want to get clean to be happy. But what is considered clean to you? 

I believe i do need a substance to help me through not only addiction, but mental issues too. Suboxone, methadone, and loperamide just isn't for me. I used phenibut while off all other substances, but thats a whole other devil itself. I cant see myself on that for years. Im completely anti social, awkward around people, and just not happy. Does anyone else feel like this? 

Sorry if this post is dull. I just feel like you guys understand me more then the people in a 12 step program. I do love 12 step programs, but they seem to look down on people who have my ideas of maintenance.

I always envied the baby boy. He was my running mate as soon as I turned sixteen. He was nine. Running around with his scumbag sister and her good for nothing friends showed him a thing or two. By sixteen, the baby boy was an active member in the amphetamine underworld in the town I grew up in. 

When he turned 18 in June of 2011, it would take a little over a year for him to catch two felonies. Aggravated Assault causing bodily and aggravated retaliation assault causing bodily. Baby boy just caught 12 years of big boy time in gladiator school.  My poor mother. 

I had just gotten out of my first stint in rehab for my ‚Äúpill problem‚Äù and my mother had JUST accepted that she would have two kids afflicted by addiction. Me, her golden haired beauty with a gift for gab, and her baby boy. The one who couldn‚Äôt keep the spin pipe out of his mouth and the guns unloaded. He was charged and a year later arrested and tried at age 19 in August of 2012. 12 years. When my mother called and gave me the verdict I immediately called Arnold. 

Over the next few years, I would play the prison game with the baby boy. Communicating with him when he scored his first cell phone, and making a scene in the visitation hall when he showed up with bumps, bruises, and cuts. I hustled pictures to inmates in exchange for their protection of the inmate I was looking out for. My baby brother. The baby boy. The first time Tim reached out to me for something serious, I happened to be at Arnold‚Äôs. I was carrying on about fuck knows what when my phone rang. I smile, look at Arnold, and say ‚ÄúThe baby boy is calling! Man I love it when he calls and I‚Äôm here. You have so much more advice and information for him than I do.‚Äù Arnold had spent his twenties and thirties locked up all over Texas. Most of our visits consisted of him reliving the days before he got hurt. His prison days. ‚ÄúHey Tim, what‚Äôs up brother? Dude I‚Äôm over at Arnold‚Äôs y‚Äôall wanna chop it up for a few?‚Äù ‚ÄúSister, take me off speakerphone.‚Äù I glance at Arnold‚Äôs face and he‚Äôs got a concerned look. He waves his hand under his chin in a motion that says, don‚Äôt you fucking dare take him off speakerphone. ‚ÄúOkay little brother, you‚Äôre off speaker‚Äù I lied to him as I move closer towards Arnold so he could hear. 

‚ÄúOkay Concentratedgarbage, I need your help. I uh...I got mixed up in some stupid shit that you won‚Äôt get and I need $200 wired to this dude‚Äôs girl in the free world by 5:00 today. You got it right?‚Äù  No I didn‚Äôt fucking have it. I had just paid off my monthly tab with Arnold and was already starting to front again this very day. ‚ÄúLook brother. I don‚Äôt have it right now but I‚Äôll get it. I‚Äôll find something to sell. We just can‚Äôt tell Ma. She doesn‚Äôt do well when you get in trouble like this. ‚ÄúAh look sister it‚Äôs all good. I‚Äôll figure it out ya know?‚Äù I could hear the quiver in his voice. Arnold heard it too. ‚ÄúYou have one minute left‚Äù the recorded voice on the prison phone system warns us. ‚ÄúBrother who do I send it to? I‚Äôll make it happen.‚Äù He gives me a phone number to text and the line goes dead. 

A few beats go by before Arnold clears his voice and I come out of my fugue state. He says, ‚Äú Hand me my wallet.‚Äù  I do as he requests and go back to my chair and my phone where I‚Äôm already thinking of lies to tell family to get the cash together. ‚ÄúHere. You can‚Äôt tell me no and you won‚Äôt pay me back. This is something I have to do. They‚Äôll kill him over a misplaced bag of soups in there.‚Äù  I took the cash and went straight to the only gas station in town with a western union. He helped me take care of the baby boy like that countless times. 

Tim cried when he got my letter informing him of his savior‚Äôs passing. He cried and wrote me back. I received the tear stained letter on the day of his memorial. Like some kind of sick joke reminding me of what a junkie I‚Äôm being. ",1533360867.0

The entire exchange between his daughter and I had made me nervous. I felt very exposed. Although I knew she didn‚Äôt know about the potential of my profiting thousands of dollars off of her dad that she would never touch, I still felt very raw and at risk that day inside of his house. On the way back to Tonya‚Äôs I had decided what I would do. 

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm about to head back down south. Fuck this town, why are you even still here?‚Äù Tonya stares at me as I talk these words and chain smoke on her porch. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to take them are you, Concentratedgarbage? Please don‚Äôt do yourself in like this.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo Tonya I‚Äôm not going to take them all myself. I have a plan.‚Äù I proceed to tell Tonya that I‚Äôll be renting a storage unit that I was already planning on doing and keeping the entire stock inside tucked away. Six entire hours away from where I live. I tell her I will only take one bottle at a time, keep a few for myself and sell the rest. ‚ÄúWould you like a cut of the profit?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt want any of that dirty money. Do something good with it at least to make up for all the lives you‚Äôre ruining.‚Äù Jesus fucking Christ Tonya knows how to lay it on thick. 

After telling her I would take one bottle and store the rest, I proceed to take two bottles of oxy and one bottle of alps. ‚ÄúOkay let‚Äôs see how this goes, Concentratedgarbage. You got this shit girl. You can control your use because of how money driven you are. You‚Äôre better now. You‚Äôre not the junkie you used to be.‚Äù I told myself on my beautiful drive back home. 

Once I got home everything took off. I started doing better at work, getting a side business started that was actually successful, and also had to really work on my acting game. I started out great that first week. Wouldn‚Äôt take more than 3 doses from the time I woke up until bed, had a good set of people who were great chippers and always paid my asking price per pop. I fronted and used them to get things I wanted. If I was broke, all I needed was to find the local small time dboy and cut him a deal. It was great the first fuckin week. I proceeded to only end up selling 100 and I fucking took 200 down my gullet. After that first week I was redosing every hour. I stayed almost entirely nodded out when I wasn‚Äôt hustling parts of my stash. I ran out on the 28th. I had three hundred oxy 30s for 24 days and they‚Äôre gone with very little to show. My current state of affairs right now is a bit hopeful. I have decided to try and make one or two large sales and get the entire inventory out of my life. 

Tonya is very pleased. She‚Äôs been worried about me this month and with good fucking reason. I‚Äôm really going to try and continue to add to this story as it unfolds but for now, as I sit in the afterglow of some of the worst withdrawals I‚Äôve ever had, I‚Äôm almost giddy about the fact that I lived to tell about it, and still have the chance to either change my life for the good or bad.

My dad is going in Monday for a double hip replacement. He is already in a pain management contract with his doctor who gave him x90 30s plus an additional x30 15s.

However I just don't feel like this will be enough. My dad has a huge tolerance and can easily take 300-500 mg of oxy a day just for the pain alone.

My question is I don't want my dad to suffer. The surgeon performing the surgery pretty much asked if he wants the hospital to administer their own meds or stick to my dad's pain management  contract. My dad said to stick with his PM doc. My dad's PM doc and surgeon have been in constant communication which is good.

Anyway to the point my dad wants to be put under general anesthia so he's asleep basically while under the knife. Will they give my dad anything for the pain say fentanyl, morphine iv drip, opana? Or do I just bring in his personal script of blues? He's going to be in the hospital for 2 nights

Obviously he's not going to accept any vicodins or percocets from the hospital as they won't do shit for him
 

I'm just worried the blues aren't going to touch his pain. 

Will the hospitsl administer fentanyl, morphine. Opana if they say he is in extreme pain without jeapordizing his pain management contract?

Thank you brothers. That's all I have to ask

I always find it hard to drink and not throw up after just a few shots of vodka or few glasses of red wine even while sober, but today, only 2dl of red wine has got me puking my guts out and totally ruining my buzz a few hours after I drank it on 300mg DHC. 

I know the obvious dangers of mixing depressants with other depressants, but apart from passing out in a totally dysphoric state, I can't say that I was affected in that aspect, except for maybe a hangover that I'm having currently like half a day after having the combo. I'm washing it away with a little weed, pizza and sleep and it sure does help. So anyways, does any of you drink with your opis?

I‚Äôm rifling through an entire host of emotions and questions. I reach down into the bag and pull out a bottle of oxy. Open it and pour out three. Break one in half, take the other two whole, throw the half back in the bottle. 

My tolerance was down but not that low yet. I‚Äôd been basically clean for like two months now, last chip was only twenty pills and that was in May. That was when I called Tonya for the first time in almost two years and told her Arnold was bad. He didn‚Äôt look like the normal sick he was, but something more aggressive was taking the life out of him. Sure enough, by the end of May he had been put in the hospital only to discharge with hospice care. That last three days before he made his last trip to the hospital. Sepsis is hard to come back from if you‚Äôre already sick with diabetes and the lack of mobility. 

I swallow the two and half pills dry with the spit that had collected in my mouth while realizing what I possessed in my lap.  ‚ÄúNo fucking way. Where did you get this? Did anyone see you take it?‚Äù Tonya looks dumb founded. ‚ÄúTHAT‚ÄôS YOURS! He said to ensure you get this black bag once he is dead. That‚Äôs what he left you.‚Äù I get up and go outside. It‚Äôs only been a few minutes since I popped those two and half but I‚Äôm already feeling it. Tonya joins me outside. ‚ÄúPlease tell me you‚Äôre not gonna take them all. Concentratedgarbage you can‚Äôt let this fuck your life up. You need to sell them and make some money. That‚Äôs what he would‚Äôve wanted. Why in the fuck did he leave you this? I feel like I‚Äôm signing your death certificate right fucking now.‚Äù 

I go ahead and light up another as we stand in the heavy silence of what she just said. It‚Äôs true you know. I was already trying to think of a way to make this impact my life in as much positivity as possible. ‚ÄúTonya, I have to go take care of some business. I‚Äôm leaving this here with you for now. Do not tell anyone about what we have.‚Äù ‚ÄúWE?!‚Äù Tonya yells. ‚ÄúNo, the demons in that bag are not something WE have, those are something YOU have. I‚Äôm not getting mixed up in any of this.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay Tonya fine, I hear you on that. I‚Äôm leaving them here until I go back down south. I‚Äôve got to work out some shit. Please.‚Äù 

She finally agrees to let me leave the bag full of felonies there while I went and met with his surviving children and gave them what they needed to tie off the loose ends of their father‚Äôs miserable life. 

I get to the house around 4:00p that afternoon. Pull up in the side driveway, get out, and walk up to the first camera. It‚Äôs gone. I can see where the wires were cut whenever someone came by and pulled the camera from its place that I had so carefully hung there three years ago when Arnold got insanely paranoid. I open the front door and walk in. His two daughters and one son are in his room directly to the right when you walk in. They don‚Äôt recognize me after five years. 

‚ÄúHe...hello guys. I‚Äôm so sorry about your dad. I am still in disbelief and came as quickly as I could‚Äù I say with as much emotion as that 75mg of oxy would allow. Tonya says y‚Äôall need some of his information on his accounts and other things.‚Äù His younger but smarter daughter says, ‚ÄúAnd why is it that YOU are the one we have to get this from. What business did you have with him these past few years?‚Äù She fucking knew. She never forgot why I started coming to her house twelve years ago and why I was still coming around five years ago when she first moved out and left him. She knew but she never would say it. Never called out the junkie that took care of her dad. I‚Äôm so thankful. I don‚Äôt know what I would‚Äôve even said.

I thought I was the only heroin addict in the house,"He was sick with flu like symptoms for 2 days and then he got a couriered package from one of his friends in a distant city where he lives. Within 30 minutes he no longer had influenza, hmmm... 

Then the other evening he nodded off watching television and I couldn't wake him, I knew to do the rubbing knuckles into the sternum thing thanks to the harm reduction coalition and that woke him up and of course his pupils were pretty small so we had to have that talk and I'll be dammed, I though I was the only heroin addict within a very large radius, his mother pasted away about two years ago and I know she is turning over in her grave.

I never saw any value in naloxone as I am a secret addict and always dose in private. No one would be around to give me naloxone or even know they should so I'm always super careful. Not a single person in the world knows of my problem, except for one addictions counselor who didn't believe me (even though it was only the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth) and some folks on the Internet like yourself.

I went to the pharmacy and asked about naloxone and ended up walking out with a free kit of two ampules and needles after a 15 minute personal training session given by the pharmacist. The same silly government that won't allow me to go on buprenorphine therapy without losing my job funds free naloxone kits for anyone that asks, I'll be dammed. At least they got one thing right.

Turns out this opiate crisis is even closer to home than I thought. I didn't know why he was sick, if I had I would have dosed him (if that is what he wanted), it would have been the humane thing to do. He was very surprised by my lack of judgement, knowledge, understanding and empathy for his problem. No one can help me but I will find him help the instant he wants it and he now knows that.

94d1e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/94d1e1/perc30_shit_post/,97,https://redd.it/94d1e1,Justlurkin4321,Perc30 (shit post),"  I've been member of  r\opiates for a little over 2 years now. I'm almost postive this is my first time submitting a post. And im likely going to receive some hate for it. Its something thats really bugged me for some time now but I've always decided to let it go rather then piss someone off. This isnt directed at any one user as it happens every time this is mentioned.



   So here it goes.. I've noticed that any time someone refers to a 30mg oxycodone as a perc 30 someone always feels the need to correct that person and or make a smart comment pretending that they dont know what the persons refering to. Where I live and im sure other places across the us a perc 30 is the most common nickname for a 30mg oxycodone. Im willing to bet that 99% of the users here know exactly what the person is refering too just as if they were to call it a blue or m-box, or K9, roxi etc...

   


   The reason it bothers me when this happens is because i feel like it comes from that person in most cases as a way to belittle someone and make themselves feel superior as if they are some opiate expert. This type of thing I'd expect to see on r\trees or r\drugs when some 17 year old calls out a 15 year old for stating something incorrect about marijuana or r\drugs when someone makes an incorrect remark about fuckin Robitussin. It just seems so childish to me. Yeah we all know there isnt a 30mg Percocet, Its a nickname. Its not even like the person is ever actually calling it a 30mg Percocet which i would have less of an issue with someone correcting. They are using a commonly accepted street nickname for 30mg oxycodone.

   


   Ive heard people say well this is a site about harm reduction. Well if thats the case then call everything by its proper name. I mean what the fuck is a dilly or a panda?

   


   This is just gotten under my skin for a while now. Just had to put it out there and get it off my chest.

I was driving 75 down the interstate as I continued on my six hour journey. I like to listen to Black Stand-up comedians when I drive for long periods. Katt Williams and the like keep me giggling and distracted while I make this fucking boring ass drive. 

This time was different though. It was like I had accepted I was going to be clean forever once Arnold went into the hospital. I didn‚Äôt have the nerve to ask him for pills while he was actively dying. I just couldn‚Äôt. I was fucking proud of myself for finally feeling like I had it together. Here I was, standing by his side being here for the right reasons. What a joke. This trip was different. I was driving without the anticipation of getting high. I was making this trip solely because my friend had died and I was needed to help close out his final affairs. Look at me, not a junkie but such a great fucking friend. 

Lavelle Crawford is doing a bit on my Pandora Urban Comedian station. I love this dude. I think he‚Äôs one of the funniest black comedians of my time. Well, I don‚Äôt know how qualified I am to say that as a white thirty something chick but I digress. Lavelle Crawford is doing one of my favorite bits of his when Tonya calls. ‚ÄúYello?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere are you? Are you actually coming ? Where are you staying?‚Äù I lit another cig and inhaled the smoke before I started to answer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got about three and half hours to go and was hoping I could crash at your place. That cool?‚Äù Tonya goes on to agree that yes I can stay with her as she has this package for me that she‚Äôs nervous about. I still don‚Äôt have a fucking clue what she‚Äôs going on about. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that black gift bag, Concentratedgarbage. The one he had me hide all the time. It‚Äôs just a black paper bag. You know what I am talking about right?‚Äù I‚Äôm confused. Arnold rarely hid things from me unless I was getting out of control with my use, but it had been over a year since we had even had to have that conversation. Like I said, I was chipping and fine like that. ‚ÄúLook Tonya, I have no fucking clue what you‚Äôre talking about with this black bag but if it‚Äôs for me then he obviously wanted me to have it so just quit worrying about it.‚Äù Tonya snorted her goodbye and told me to call when I got to town so she could let me in. 

I pull over at a truck stop about a half hour from Tonya‚Äôs little apartment. I needed to take a shit and eat something and felt comfortable doing those things alone instead of inside Tonya‚Äôs tiny efficiency. I call her as I‚Äôm leaving. ‚ÄúBe there in ten or fifteen mins. Get the bag out. I want to see it first thing.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôm unlocking the front door now. You want any coffee?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôll drink a few cups with you. I feel like we should try and catch up some. Maybe you can get a few things off your mind, too.‚Äù Tonya finally gives me a laugh and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready to hug your neck. I‚Äôm sorry he‚Äôs gone Concentratedgarbage, I know how close y‚Äôall got.‚Äù  I hung up. Tears crept up on me this time. Look at me, having actual emotions now. What a great fucking friend.

I pull up to Tonya‚Äôs place right at 2:00p. It‚Äôs fucking hot. She looks ten years older than she did last time I saw her in 2016. I believe it was hot then too. She smiles as I walk up and we almost look like a mother and daughter embracing after a long time away from each other. To normal people passing by, we looked like regular people meeting again after missing one another for regular reasons. That‚Äôs how it looked. Tonya knew what dark things went on between Arnold and myself. She knew how much of a junkie I used to be and never faulted me. Always treated me like I was a silly kid. She hugs my neck and immediately starts crying. Once again I‚Äôm stuck with dry eyes. ‚ÄúOh Concentratedgarbage it‚Äôs been HORRible. His kids are the WORST and nobody knows anything about his life from the last five years. I don‚Äôt know what to tell them!‚Äù ‚ÄúTonya, it‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll talk to them. Show me this package. I need to know what the fuck he left me.‚Äù Tonya‚Äôs face sours. ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt know any better I would think you were on of his fucking piece of shit kids. They didn‚Äôt come around until he was dead and they could go through what he had that could make them some money.‚Äù ‚ÄúFuck you Tonya. Get the fuckin bag.‚Äù I rarely raise my voice as is, Tonya could sense my anger at her judgement. ‚ÄúPlease, get the bag Tonya.‚Äù

She goes into her closet and pulls out a box. Inside the box, a plastic bag that‚Äôs wrapped around something square and black. She rips the Wal-Mart sack off and reveals a black gift bag. Just a simple black paper sack. She comes and drops it into my lap. I can hear the sound of pills hitting plastic when the bag reaches my lap. Without a moments hesitation, I rip the bag apart where it had been staples shut at the top and gaze down upon my inheritance. 

Lining the bottom of this black bag were 32 bottles. 16 of the bottles each contained 150 OC 30s and the other 16 bottles each contained 100 green alprazalom. I gazed upon them for a few beats before I could look back up at Tonya, who had a smug ass look on her face that made me want to punch her directly in the cunt. 

**Okay guys, as promised I finished out the bag. Yesterday marked a month since I lost my friend and tomorrow marks a month since my discovery of this inheritance. If anyone wants to hear the rest of the story to present, then let me know. I always feel like such a shitbag about myself that it had to be pretty clear if people want to hear more. Thanks so much guys, it‚Äôs such a rush having people hear you. Like hear the real shit you‚Äôve been hiding from literally everyone except the one friend that died. And fucking Tonya.

My nose is a bit runny and my skin and muscles have that weird electric feeling, but it's very mild.  I think I will wake up feeling great tomorrow.  2 k-chill kratom shots have worked a charm and I haven't needed any lopes. So, if you're in the same boat as me, forge ahead.  It's not too bad.",1533323315.0

At this point, I was a master at chipping. I had a decent job, no responsibilities other than this beat up blazer I drove back and forth to work. No kids no real relationships to maintain. My family and friends were all I needed. I was a high functioning user. Would be clean for a week, high a week, always smoked weed but my usage was highly maintained by Arnold.  Anytime he suspected I was ‚Äúcoming undone‚Äù he would either tell me he sold out for two weeks or only have enough to help me get clean. By fall of that year, I was doing fucking GREAT. I had lost a bunch of weight and got cute....oh boy, it was fucking on. I excelled at work, made more money, all the while Arnold kept a close eye on our bartering system. 

Arnold had a doozy for me right before Halloween that year.  He called me while I was at work one night, ‚ÄúSay, let‚Äôs talk some real business, Concentratedgabage. I have a favor to ask you but it‚Äôs going to require some work out of both of us, can you swing by tonight when you get off wor.....‚Äù  Now, a lot of you know how wonderful it is when your dboy needs a favor from you.  I interrupted him, ‚ÄúYeah man, lets talk right now. Whatcha got? Whatcha need? Can we work out a trade for whatever it is you‚Äôre gonna need? Could you go ahead and front it to me tonight and I‚Äôll do the favor whenever dude.‚Äù He had already grown tired of my ranting and had hung up on me. I knew it was going to be an evening I got high. He always paid me for any time I spent with him even when I told him he didn‚Äôt have to, he did. This drug is funny like that. Gives you a reason to worship someone if it means they‚Äôll break you off something. He knew I would do anything I could for him because he would always compensate me in the only way I wanted to be paid. 

I jumped in my barely legal blazer, fired up a cig, and popped the last OC 30 I had. I wasn‚Äôt worried about being too frivolous with my stash. I had a feeling it was going to be the last time I would have to worry about posting another front or doing a crazy amount of side work just to stave off the sickness. At this point in my use, w/ds weren‚Äôt really as bad as we know they can be with heavier use, but I still had already started to spend less and less time sober and/or clean. I took a longer road home that night just to enjoy my life the exact way it was for a few minutes longer. I knew I was about to last off and I was ready. 

The exact same ritual every single time I‚Äôve ever pulled into Arnold‚Äôs. Pull into the side driveway, get out, walk up to the camera, ensure I stand there long enough for him to know I‚Äôm there and it‚Äôs me. The door is unlocked. He never felt the need to lock it as nobody dared approach his camera without a rock solid reason to be on his property. 

He was mean as a snake. Everyone in town thought he was insane. There were just a few people that had anything to do with him. Then there was me. Nobody questioned me. I‚Äôm sure they talked some but never to my face. 

I walked in, plopped down on my chair that was across from him, and he has already put the tray with the weed and some papers out on his table he keeps close. I immediately start rolling us a few doobies. His hands didn‚Äôt work well enough to actually twist a joint but he could light and smoke one without any help. ‚ÄúYou always roll them too fat. The next one needs to be thinner. Roll me five to get through tomorrow afternoon.‚Äù   I continue to roll another joint and smirk because he and I both know living alone in one room for the passed ten years has made him into such an obsessive lunatic. I always humored him though. He was allowed to be crazy over the size of his doobies without any judgement from me. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs this business you wanted to talk to me about? You said it would require some work on both ends but you felt it would be worth it to me? What‚Äôs the deal? Why is your living room such a wreck? Is Tonya not coming around anymore?‚Äù He had already grown weary of my talking. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I wanted to talk to you. She quit today, and I don‚Äôt trust anyone in this fucking town except you and her, and she‚Äôs getting too old and sick to continue doing my home care each week.‚Äù It took a minute for it to sink in what he was getting at. He was fully disabled in the state we were in and was given 42 hours a week of home care by an employee of one of the large Home health agencies in our state. It paid ten bucks an hour and the only requirement the company that provides the care giver has is that you have no felony. I was a fucking shoe-in for the job. About two weeks later I was his home care giver. Since I had a full time job that was mainly night shifts I would go over to his place every morning and do house work cook for him and then we would also just chill and smoke. Every two weeks I had an extra $475 in my pocket plus my regular salary. I was able to work two jobs and make decent money that was legit all while having a direct line to my source for the chemicals that allowed me to have the energy to work two full time jobs at once. We carried on like that for two years. I eventually decided to move away and so the jig was up. Went back to chipping every two months and my life started going great again. I knew it was coming to an end every time I would go by his house when I would make the drive to pick up some 30s and see my old friends. He looked weaker and skinnier every trip I made. March of this year, I went by his place and knew he looked worse than ever before. I begged him to go to the hospital but he vehemently declined. He got angry with me so I backed off. 

I got a call on the second of July. It was fucking hot as shit outside and I was running out of chances to step outside and check my phone. 

I had been to the hospital six hours away from where I am currently living three times in the last seven days. Would leave after work at six and get to the hospital at eleven. Sit by his side until 4p the next day and try to get back before ten that night. He was fucking dying but was completely lucid and awake. His body was failing from years of not moving and chain smoking. The wounds on his feet slowly crawled up his legs and poisoned his blood. The doctor had already told him he was terminal and wouldn‚Äôt get over this. They could take his leg but even if he survived that surgery his other organs were already starting to fail. I sat by his bed and we talked about death. He would say he wasn‚Äôt ready. Then would stare at me while I tried to cry. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to make it outta this. I‚Äôm not leaving this hospital alive.    

I finally was able to go outside and call Tonya back. She had called three times in the last ten minutes. She came back to him in May when I called her and told her how bad of shape he was in. She stayed by his side everyday until the second. ‚ÄúConcentratedgarbage he‚Äôs fucking gone. He‚Äôs dead. Arnold is dead. He‚Äôs never coming back. You need to come up here. Tell me when you‚Äôre coming when you know‚Äù and the line went silent. I shakily tried to call her back but she turned off her phone. Nobody in my office knew of any of this. Tears stung my eyes. Fuck. I instantly missed him. Felt a space in myself. My friend died. 

I end up leaving work early and spent the next two days in a very disconnected state of mind. I left the morning of the forth. The office was closed. I called Tonya.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming up, just left. Should be there by one.‚Äù She snorts into the phone, ‚ÄúMust be fucking nice to not have to be here when they come and got his body or when I had to call his kids and tell them.‚Äù ‚ÄúFuck, Tonya I‚Äôm sorry. I couldn‚Äôt get away until today. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve been doing this all alone. I‚Äôm doing my god damned best it takes me six fucking hours to drive there. Cut me some fucking slack. You were gone for nearly two fucking years and I‚Äôve not busted your balls once.‚Äù She softened a bit. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm just so stressed out. I need you to help me take care of his final expenses. He gave me directions but told me you had all of his passwords and pins. He also left you something. I don‚Äôt know what it is but he said make sure you get it once he is dead. Y‚Äôall had some kind of weird relationship so who knows what it is. Just get up here as quick as you can. I am tired of holding onto to it.‚Äù 

**Okay guys I am going to finish out soon. I have a couple things I have to do this afternoon but I will round off the story. I‚Äôm so glad that there are some folks who are reading. 95% of everything I‚Äôm writing is the truth but it‚Äôs up to you to believe that or not.

Weird cycle, I know. But I had multiple failed detox attempts, everytime I would detox and get through WD, id fall into the deepest ever depressive suicidal state and end up relapsing. I quit methadone almost CT, while in a psych. ward. And when I got out, really didn't wanna relapse, But my main reason for opioid use was my TRD/MDD which I did not respond to several meds.

So I thought i was clean, got on tianeptine, used that as a crutch. I was buying it in bulk, buy the grams, I started shooting it, until I destroyed all my veins, and was megadosing, and at a certain point had to switch to oral, because my veins were destroyed.

Detoxed basically CT in the psych ward again, it was absolute hell. Got out, and this time, I remembered reading about kratom and its mild opioid properties, started this, and it really helped and worked in the beginning, but after 2 yrs, my dose went up to 70g a day, and I was taking it just to function.

Finally, came across ibogaine, did some quick research, talked with the owner for a few weeks, very passionate guy, skyped with him as well, once I finally felt comfortable, went to mexico and did a 7 day detox.

I made a post about in another sub. But just thought i'd share my history with opiates here. I just got back from the clinic a few days ago. Very short drive from San Diego. It was nothing like I expected, luxurious, and better treatment than any healthcare I ever received in the US, fully staffed medical facility, with Dr's, Nurses, Therapists, Cook/Maid, My own bedroom w/bathroom, and right on the beach.

 I finally feel some relief without opioids in my system. I just hope this lasts.....I am going to try maybe looking into iboga booster doses to stay off. I hope the suicidal depressive episodes dont come back.

Still battling depression, but really feel much better than I have in years.  I really hope I can keep this up. Any suggestions?

And of course, I know aftercare is very important. If I had the money, I would just start a new life and leave my current environment.",1533318600.0

I've never even seen this stuff (Canada), but I've now got my hands on some, and will likely only be using tar for some time now.

I've always injected number Number 4 and nothing else (other than potential fentanyl or other cuts I'm unaware of). I have access to a needle exchange and can get my hands on any equipment needed. I'm also an addict and will be subsisting on tar and injecting it several times a day, if that makes a difference.

With that said, what should I know when transitioning fron powder to tar? Do I need to cook it differently? Do I need to use vitamine C with this stuff? Or is it identical to Number 4 in terms of injecting? Do you find that you need a higher or lower dose? Are there harm reduction-related things to know about tar that don't apply to Number 4?

I just so happened to be a college chick who sold small amounts of weed and had a large taste for those lovely PKs. We became fast friends. 

Me, smart young fledgling junkie who hadn‚Äôt lost anything yet, and him, a bitter and sick man at age 42. He knew I would always be there for him because he held my first true love, hydrocodone 10s. I was no stranger to manipulation but I was new to the junkie life. It wasn‚Äôt until about six or seven years into our friendship that I realized the power he had over me. 

It was a never ending supply. Alprazolam came next and royally fucked my world for about a year. Two years ago are when I first met the OC 30s. Over the years he went from hydro to the oxys...or rather, I went from the hydros to the oxys. Anywho, the first 30 I ate was bliss. ‚ÄúThis,  Arnold, this is what I‚Äôve always needed‚Äù I remember saying. He just gave me a look that said nothing and everything. It‚Äôs a funny thing when you have a limitless supply of something. You go ahead and adjust your way of living behind the notion that things will never change and the supply will never deplete. The day I saw the black gift bag that was presented to me on the 4th of July was nauseating. ‚ÄúNo fucking way. Where did you get this shit? Did anyone see you take it? Oh. It‚Äôs mine?‚Äù I thought I could finally stay off of them now that he was dead and the supply ran out, but little did I know the amount of work ahead of me.

I did change a name to protect my friend. Not that anyone would know him but now that he is dead I feel the need to continue the way we were, which was very private and knowing that we both knew and understood the reasoning behind a young blonde‚Äôs willingness to spend such an extensive amount of time with a man such as he.

I tried it for a third time same dose same pills and I actually felt high this time but it came with this nasty dizzy feeling that really kinda overrode this high to be honest, i went to sleep just to make the shitty feeling go away and I woke up after 10 hours of sleep still feeling like shit. I had to roll a blunt just to take the edge off the shitty ass dizzy feeling I had. I seem all these documentaries about how it made people feel like heaven and all this good shit what am I missing? Or is the ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù just overhyped?",1533309072.0

As you embark upon the strange and horrifying journey that is reading this book, it may cause you to question whether bringing a child into this world is the right thing to do anymore. It may not be. I don‚Äôt know. As your eyes travel the lines of ink, you may ask yourself why you‚Äôre even reading such trash. That‚Äôs on you. I can‚Äôt say. As your mind moves from thought to thought, you may wonder, ‚ÄúHow does a person come up with such inane dialogue or depraved violence or this ridiculous storyline?‚Äù This one, I can answer. 

Boogers.

Boogers are the unthinking result of any human being when certain extrabodily substances are breathed in. The body has no need for these things, namely dirt, particle debris or dust and the sloughed, dead skin cells of other human beings. So, the nose excretes mucus to catch the unwanted waste floating in the air, dries out and creates a nice little morsel to be easily extracted with a finger and flicked or wiped under your desk.

My writing process is the same. Unwanted information comes at me all day in the form of conversations between strangers at the store, jokes my friend told me fourteen years ago, old footage of hydrogen bombs exploding in desert, the obnoxious and steroid fueled ramblings of Macho Man Randy Savage and the like. My mind traps these bits of useless stimuli by excreting my imagination and personality like a mucus into my brain that dries out to create another kind of easily extracted morsel, but instead of wiping them on seats or the back of someone else‚Äôs shirt, I write. Words, as I know them, can be salty or bloody or crunchy or slimy or any combination of those things just like boogers. 

Every sentence is a booger.

There were three other books I wanted to write: one about an angry old man who rides public transportation all day giving out extremely bad and unsolicited advice to strangers, another one about a rag tag group of immigrant sheepherders, and one about a homeless piece of Kleenex who struggles through life until he finally gets a break and starts a family of his own outside of Kansas City. The one about the Kleenex was a feel-good piece, one for the whole family to enjoy, but it was too short as were the other ones. So, I waited. I let my mind do what it does, the way my nose does what it does.

After a while, I put my finger in there, dug around and pulled this thing out. It‚Äôs called The Terrible Hop Brothers. I hope you can forgive me, because it is. Absolutely. Terrible.

Your Friend,

Riley

The Terrible Hop Brothers.  

The Ballad of Rufus Cumberbutt

The popularly circulated fiction that is our siblinghood begins with a transsexual prostitute from Bolivia who went by the name Naranja, claiming to be sweeter than any orange any man could buy at any super market in town. She may have been. I never found out just how sweet she was, but when I hear people refer to Rufus as my brother, I think of her. 

She was the one who said it first. Rufus adopted it and introduced me to everyone as his brother after that, and he knew pretty much everyone. It was on a summer morning, and we were way up the hill in the middle of the city in the blinding white, light of the sun. The city never gets like that. Sometimes, the sun comes out and you have to take your jacket off, but this was like high noon in the Sahara, which is so abnormal its making this whole memory seem like a dream to me. And I don‚Äôt even know what we were doing up there, the way you just kind of end up in situations with your friends or family or other random people doing and saying crazy things in dreams.

So, there we were. I don‚Äôt remember why, but I do remember Rufus was in the middle of telling me he was going to need to fix soon. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna need to fix soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?  It's too hot.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Boom Boom, I‚Äôm not feeling good.‚Äù He had a habit of prematurely telling people that he was sick. He would even say it between nods, but this time he wasn‚Äôt exaggerating too badly. Our habits were about the same. We‚Äôd split our last heroin together, and I was starting to feel normal again myself.

‚ÄúOkay. Well, lets go see Carlos or Juju or Leroy. I got a few bucks.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù On the way down the hill, our hips swaying side to side and our shoes slapping the sidewalk as we absorbed the shock, he began to talk. It never failed to blow me away how ridiculous his statements could be. ‚ÄúYeah, Boom Boom, I‚Äôm thinking about becoming an artist.‚Äù

‚ÄúAn artist? What do you know about art?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing really, but that don‚Äôt matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do you figure that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, half of art is just who the artist is and other crap like that. It doesn‚Äôt have to be that great.‚Äù

He did have a point. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs kinda true, but still.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut still, what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. What kind of stuff are you gonna paint?‚Äù

Rufus produced a bottle of ginger-ale out of nowhere, like a magician. Now, he offered it to me. I wasn‚Äôt a germaphobe, but Rufus was extra-unhygienic. He wore a raggedy, red beard, which always held the coagulated globules of some rancid grease or clots of half-chewed food in half-hardened chunks like dead baby birdies decaying in a nest or something. It smelled bad. Even worse, though, were his bleeding gums and the breath that came with his rotten mouth. Something unspoken inside of me would never let me drink after him. I realize now it was fear of catching his bad breath. Maybe that was irrational, but I just wouldn‚Äôt do it. 

He held the drink out a moment longer before I put my palm up and shook my head. It disappeared after that. 

‚ÄúWell, Boom Boom, I have thought long and hard about this.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I have. As you know, my name is Rufus Cumberbutt.‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúAnd if you wanted to get technical, that would be Dr. Rufus Cumberbutt, the third.‚Äù

I opened my eyes and smiled. I‚Äôd never heard the bit about him being a third. One would have been enough. 

‚ÄúSo, the pieces will be called Cumberbutts. See? That already puts them in class with, I don‚Äôt know, let‚Äôs say a Monet? A Warhol? A Dali? A Cumberbutt.‚Äù

‚ÄúHaha. I don‚Äôt know about all that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. On top of the name, my hardened street persona and the intrigue of my character will bolster value in a major way. I‚Äôm telling ya! Hop head extraordinaire and street criminal Rufus Cumberbutt, a man who rejected a successful career as a doctor to live on the streets. How much more interesting could an artist be? Huh? I mean, I could even fake my own death.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. We‚Äôll make it really violent and mysterious.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe? Whatever. But what are they going to look like. You never said.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be pleased to hear that I‚Äôve also given a lot of attention to this aspect of being an artist, as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean the art?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, my dear Boom Boom, the art. The art will be as mysterious and dark and genius as the artist himself. I will paint with black and red only on white canvas. The art will be simple. It will just say dark and cryptic things in like an old typewriter font. I might have to get someone else to help me with all that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Maybe they can just do it for you. What will the quotes be?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you‚Äôve given this so much thought.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have. It‚Äôs still in the works. I will sign them R. Cumberbutt, though. Or just Rufus. And there‚Äôll only be 4 or 5 ever made.‚Äù

‚Äú4 or 5 prints of each piece?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, sir. 4 or 5 pieces total.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, the shorter my career, the more mysterious, the more mysterious, the more valuable. Less pieces make them harder to find. When they‚Äôre harder to find, the more they cost. You understand?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt get an answer from me. Besides, the fact that everything he‚Äôd just said was ridiculous and that he wasn‚Äôt even joking, we were outside of the New Honk Kong Hotel a few blocks from downtown. I had business there. We were an inseparable duo, except for all the times we got separated. Like that day. That day we got separated, even though we never meant to. 

‚ÄúRoof, I‚Äôm a run up here real quick. I gotta see Bug.‚Äù Bug was one of two black, identical twins from Michigan. Bug and Boo. Apparently, they‚Äôd gone by those names since they grew up in the 60s there. 

‚ÄúK. I‚Äôll be here.‚Äù

As I entered the bottom of the dark stairway into the hotel, I whispered the word eyeball to myself three times. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball. Then again at the top of the stairs while I was waiting for the hotel manager to buzz the gate. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball. And after I signed in with my fake ID card at the front desk, I whispered again. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball. One more time as I knocked on the door at room 408. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball.

The fading heroin high sat in my throat like a warm sticky egg. I also imagined that the feeling it left in my stomach was a molten heavy metal like lead or mercury. Bug‚Äôs muffled voice came through the door.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me. Boom Boom.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got some money. I was wondering if you could help me out.‚Äù 

As soon as the chain lock came off the door, I pushed it open. He knew something was up and moved towards the window, where he turned sideways and bowed like a scared child. A young boy, maybe 19, maybe 18, I don‚Äôt know, lay on the bed wearing nothing but a kimono. His bangs stuck to his sweaty face. The room smelled like silicone and salty sweat. The boy was making weird spaceship sounds and gesturing wildly in the air. It was clear whatever amount of meth he‚Äôd just shot was too much for him. Bug was naked and shaking.

‚ÄúWhat you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúI come for Jimbo. He sent me per the Faceless One‚Äôs request. You know why I‚Äôm here?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond. That was a yes as much as anything. I didn‚Äôt really know what I was doing there, though. I just knew we were all bad people doing bad things and when we got what we got around these parts, it was because we lived the lives we lived. No surprises. No tears. Just street life. 

I tried to get Bug to calm down. 

‚ÄúI like this Buddha statue you got here. Do you ever rub it for good luck?‚Äù Certain parts of his brain had never developed from childhood. They had atrophied. It was most notable in his speech patterns. He talked like a kid.

‚ÄúNo. Never.‚Äù

I put my hand on the large brass statue. Bug jerked and reached toward his headboard and produced a knife. I broke his foot with the Buddha. As he fell to the floor, I stepped on his chest and bent down making a U shape with my thumb and pointer finger. They slowly pushed in around the eyeball and this strange series of thoughts and emotions ran through me.  I remembered being a kid with my sister, when our mom took us down to Mississippi to see her father late one spring. We stayed several weeks and into summer, and in the yard at our grandfather‚Äôs house, we had these weird mud things sticking out of the ground. He told us they were mudbug huts, like crayfish. We even took our little arms and pushed them down into the muddy holes searching for the little creatures. 

Wrist deep and sweating in that room with the slime of his eye socket on my skin, it reminded me of that, but unlike the crustaceans in my grandfather's yard when I was a boy, his eye was easy to find. It snapped in a dull thud, muffled by his brain and head. I had it.

He cried on the floor. There wasn‚Äôt much blood. He would never say anything about it because if he did, he knew it would be more of the same or much worse. The boy in the kimono kept swooshing and swishing and now he was chewing a blue ink pen that had broken in his mouth and ran all down the side of his chin and face. I got my fake ID from the front desk and walked outside. 

The sun blinded me again. Rufus told me to hold on. He ran down the block to see someone, but it looked like he ran to tell the cops to arrest him. They just happened to see him at the corner. They knew his mug and ran his name which came back with warrants. 

He was always going to jail. I never went. And I always thought that was funny because I was the one doing the really bad stuff. He was in trouble for pan handling or sleeping in the park and not paying his tickets. I was literally picking the pink flesh from another man‚Äôs eye socket like a piece of pulp from my thumbnail and trying to find something to put the eyeball in so that it wouldn‚Äôt get crushed as I watched him get cuffed.

Naranja was at the corner as I passed. Rufus smiled at me from the back of the car. The window was down, and he heard her ask me why my brother had just gotten arrested. Rufus howled from the back seat. 

‚ÄúBROTHER?!?!?! Oh no! If that don‚Äôt beat all. Boom Boom‚Äôs my brother, boys, y‚Äôall hear that?‚Äù 

The cops looked at me. It was more attention than I needed. I had an eyeball in my breast pocket, which I had to get to Jimbo‚Äôs shop ASAP. Rufus seemed to think it was hilarious, and when he got out a few days later, he told everyone we were brothers. Sometimes, I daydream of giving her grief for the irritation it‚Äôs caused me since she asked him that question, and I would. 

But she‚Äôs dead. They found her body behind a dumpster several years back, stabbed in the neck, face, head and hands 58 times according to the newspapers and left to choke in a puddle of her own blood. That‚Äôs life on these streets. That‚Äôs how it can end, at any second. But, it is only a rumor (us being brothers, that is, not her murder. Her murder really did happen, just as violently and terribly as I‚Äôve told it.) and one I‚Äôve addressed several times before now, but in case I‚Äôm mistaken about that or in case you just never got the information, I‚Äôll say it again. He‚Äôs not my brother. I‚Äôm not his. ",1533308395.0

My younger self often pondered who i would be at this age. And.. now that I‚Äôm here?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ shit. Im in a rut. The ultimate low. I have made possibly the worst decisions and acted in possibly the most detrimental way in regards to living a happy, healthy, productive and successful life. 
BUT.


I still feel positive.

I am confident.

I can make change. 

I have passion inside of me.

I have intelligence and competence inside of me.


The reality is, whether I like it or not, this phase of depression, drug abuse and isolation is now apart of my life‚Äôs novel. No going back now. So, considering that, all I can do now is, whilst I am sober and on the way upwards in life,  let this be my reminder of how bad my life was getting, and how close i have been to getting sucked into taking a very dark path for the long term. 
I have always thought that I will never ever live the conventional, underwhelming, opportunity-wasting life of a broke life-time junkie. The reason for this is because i have always felt deep in my heart, with the utmost certainty, that it would be ME that just would simply not allow that to happen, under any circumstances. And thus I‚Äôve never worried for the long-term. 
However, I‚Äôve learnt a valuable life lesson. 
It CAN happen, it WILL happen and it HAS BEEN happening. Just because I think ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never let that happen‚Äù, ‚ÄúI wont lose control of everything‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stop all of this really soon and go back to a normal life‚Äù, that doesn‚Äôt mean anything unless I am  MAKING DECISIONS ACCORDINGLY with living the life I want to live in the short term, so that I can experience it in the long term. 

I will change. 

I will do good.

I will follow my passions.

I will BE PRESENT IN THE MOMENT.

I will be happy. 

And when does it start?

Well thats the beauty of it.

It.

Starts.

If anybody has some experience to share about this combo I'll be happy to hear it!

It's worth noting I'm a pretty passive person and have a hard time fighting for myself, especially to doctors and stuff. I always feel like if I push I'll just get cut off and be labeled a drug seeker.

This may be a dumb post but in all honesty I'm a bit panicky and overwhelmed right now at the thought of having nothing to relieve the pain. Thank's for reading.

I had been on immodium since we met, we met right when I was kicked off suboxone in December and I tried to withdrawal but ended up relapsing on Dope for a month then on immodium.  I had a suboxone appointment this past Tuesday and I didn‚Äôt want to take any more immodium because I had been feeling chest tightness and it was scaring me.  So I used her car to go try to get some Xanax pills.  She found out by checking my location and she was so angry.  I didn‚Äôt even get the Xanax I turned around right away because she said she was gna leave the house without her phone.  I got home and she was gone, I called her parents and tried to find her then she came back at 5 am.  Then we weren‚Äôt really talking much that day cause she was mad at me and I was upset because I felt so bad but also like i just did it because I didn‚Äôt want to take immodium and I felt it wasn‚Äôt that bad.  Then I wake up the next morning and I see she had texted me saying she loved me and I could come sleep upstairs rather than on the couch, but that she didn‚Äôt know how to get past this.  She wasn‚Äôt home I thought she was at work and a couple hours police showed up and said she had shot herself in the head.  She parked her car somewhere and walked off into the woods and killed herself.  And it‚Äôs all my fault I‚Äôm so fucking stupid and horrible she was everything tobme she was how I finally wanted to be alive again, I had gotten a job and then moved across the country to be with her.  My baby girl died scared and alone and she had been saying she was toxic for me and we were never going to work out but she was so wrong she made me so fucking happy.  She had been sexually abused as a child and never really got help so she said she just always had this anger and sadness inside her and hurt.  And she had such issues trusting me because of what had happened to her.  When I relapsed in January we had only been dating a month and she left me and I knew I wasn‚Äôt good enough for her so I started talking to a new girl but not serious but last week she told me she still checked that girls face book every other day to see what she had that she didn‚Äôt.  But I told her that that girl was my second choice, I only got with her because she had left me! And then after a couple weeks me and that girl stopped and me and my baby got back together.  She was so amazing and so sweet but she was just so hurt and I didn‚Äôt get her help soon enough.  We had been talking to get her a therapist and she had called a bunch but couldn‚Äôt find one that was a female and also took her insurance.  I should have tried harder to help her find one.  I should have answered her text that night.  I should have sucked up through the withdrawal and not left to get Xanax.  I should have gotten off the immodium months ago.  I should have tried harder to show her how much I loved her how I truly meant that she was the most incredible and beautiful person I had ever met and that I was truly wanting to spend my entire life loving her and trying to make her happy.  I‚Äôm so so sorry baby I‚Äôm so sorry I didn‚Äôt help you enough.  I don‚Äôt know how to go on all I can think aboht is relapsing and dying to be with her.  I barely have any friends anymore because of my past issues with drugs even tho I haven‚Äôt used heroin in a year and a half except those couple weeks in January.  I posted this in the opiate recovery sub but it is just getting worse every day I don‚Äôt know how to survive this.

No parts of my body have gone blue yet but I am sweating like a pig and every nod i have to resist feels like the strongest nod you‚Äôve ever had (in a slightly scary way) 

I also did get less than 3 hours of sleep last night (don‚Äôt know if relevant)

At this point I‚Äôm typing just to keep mentally and physically engaged but I also really want any help I can get 

Also MOST IMPORTANTLY is there an amount of time since dosing that people generally agree you‚Äôre ‚Äúin the clear‚Äù? I.e. safe to engage the experience, sit down, smoke a cig etc. it‚Äôs now been 45 min or so 

PLS HELP THANK YOU

EDIT: Thank you all so very much for the advice. I did end up being fine but reading all this calmed me down considerably",1533247910.0

The result is always the same, inevitably I reach a point where I appear to only have two choices, either dose and end the withdrawal or do something crazy. No worries, this isn't one of those posts, I very much don't want to do something stupid like that but I can easily see that could happen if I was in withdrawal again and didn't have anything to make me well. I've been dosing a couple of times a day for the last year, just enough to keep me well but ultimately it's only a matter of time before my inventory is exhausted and then I will be in withdrawal with nothing to dose.

It seems the easy answer before that inevitably happens is the ultra rapid detox where you are in an intensive care unit, put into a medically induced coma and then on a naloxone drip for 6 or 8 hours. One popular protocol seems to be the [Waismann Method¬Æ]( http://www.opiates.com) but I've compiled a list of clinics all over the world that offer something similar. Surely someone here must have gone though that as they claim to have treated thousands of patients?  I'd really like to hear from someone that has gone though this acceleration of two weeks of torture into a matter of hours. How did you feel after you woke up?

I was a sweaty mess puking out the passenger door while crying hysterically. 

We had run out of OxyContin the day before and we were both sick as fuck. It was not the first time I had experienced withdrawal; in fact this was probably like a full year into our addiction. But for some reason the gravity of our situation hit me like a fucking truck. The money we were spending, the lies to our families, the items we had stolen and pawned, the fucking eviction notice we got earlier that day. 

""We're fucking junkies!"" I wailed. ""This isn't supposed to be my life!"" ""What are we going to do???"" I was inconsolable.

""Get a fucking grip"" he hissed at me. He was disgusted with me, how weak I was.  Fuck I was too. 

I sucked in air through gritted teeth until my lungs felt like they were going to explode. ""FUCK YOU"" I screamed. Customers in the parking lot all turned to look in unison. I didn't fucking care. I was absolutely destroyed in that moment. I knew I had one choice. Kill him and then myself. I could see no other way out.

(Warning, long post, I'm high af sorry)","What are your guys' thoughts comparing the two? I'm pretty pissed cuz plug told me he had 50 of ""the ones he got last time"" which were Fucking k56s so I rush down to his crib and find out they're gotdamn m367s. How you gonna fuck me over like that, I said? Oh well they're 10s, he says. Isn't that what you want? Dickhead... knows I snort too. But I can trade a few for some more NPs, so I bought em nonetheless. A score is a score, is a score no matter how shitty. 

   Anyways....how do you guys think hydro compares to oxy? I think it's garbage. I had to take 5 of em to feel just as good as I do when I snort 2 pinks. Even then, oxycodone is so much more energetic, a real euphoric feeling where the hydrocodone just makes me feel more noddy, I definitely feel good combining the two tho lol. 5 down the hatch and 3 pinks up the nose, the perfect amount of noddiness & euphoria. I mean look at me, just typing away lol. Sorry. What I actually want is your guys opinions; what do you like more? What's your preferred ROA? Do you think CWE is worth it?

93wuqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/93wuqp/interesting_week_at_work/,7,https://redd.it/93wuqp,IdleReaper,Interesting week at work.,"      Well this has been about a month ago... but I‚Äôll tell it anyways... my work piss tests... and when they do, they take like 5-6 people from my 80 or so people operation and have them piss in a cup... then ship it off to the labs to test it. And when they test it they test the metabolites to see exactly what you‚Äôve been taking. 
      Well around July my number came up... usually have a spare bottle of piss on me, but today wasn‚Äôt a good day and I was already out to begin with, had been for like a day and a half. My last shot was an opana 40 and snorted maybe 10 more mg at lunch that day, and that was almost exactly 36 hours ago. Long story short I was fucked. So I go in drinking a shit load of water knowing it damn well wasn‚Äôt going to help either but hey what the hell. So I pissed in a cup and went back to work. They usually take about a week or two for the results to come back.
     Well a week goes by and I get the phone call I‚Äôd been waiting on from medical telling me that I‚Äôd failed. They asked if I had been taking any other medications. And low and behold I‚Äôd had sinus surgery at the beginning of the year. Script for perc 7.5s. So I told them that I had taken some of those from getting hit in the face playing basketball.
    Ok well we‚Äôre going to get our information together and we‚Äôll call you back. So I scheduled vacation for the week after next. Since I travel. Didn‚Äôt wanna go all the way to BFE just to get fired and come back home... so I went to researching things... turns out, oxycodone can metabolize into oxymorphone. Got a call back from doctor lady saying everything was good and that with the information I had provided my test was negative. She was still concerned though..
      Since I she had looked into my medical history, she found out that I‚Äôd been to rehab in the past. So she has currently put me out of work pending I talk and get evaluated by a counselor. So I called the boss and he said my week of vacation wouldn‚Äôt go through either.. so I‚Äôve even still got that... only bad news is I‚Äôll be off work for 2-3 weeks pending the evaluation... which will probably also come with another drug test. But hey, I still got a Fucking Job!! Woo!!!

93wugd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/93wugd/did_i_really_die/,11,https://redd.it/93wugd,sadstateofaffair,Did I really die?,"Edit- this is actually happened and the details are based on what I can recall (changed my name), and I honestly want your opinion.......

I woke up in an ambulance to beeping sounds, EMT chatter, and the inescapable feeling that my lungs were super glued together. I literally could not breathe. I finally managed to separate my lungs and got a bit of air, but they clamped right back down, after I managed to let out a whimpering ‚ÄúHELP!‚Äù

‚ÄúGet him something in case he throws up.... Raoul, how much did you take?‚Äù

I draw another breath, lifting what literally felt like 1,000lbs on my chest, and sucked in a wisp of air.

‚ÄúNOTH-ING,‚Äù I managed to sputter as absolute panic set in. I thought I was dying, suffocating, best case scenario in an ambulance- yet still... deny, deny, deny. Some instincts....

‚ÄúRaoul, you overdosed. We can still see the white powder in your nose.‚Äù

‚ÄúI *wheeze* DIDNT *wheeze* NOTHING.‚Äù It was still impossibly difficult to breathe, and I couldn‚Äôt see.

‚ÄúRaoul, you weren‚Äôt breathing. Your face was blue. We need to know what you took and how much you took.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt see. My arms and legs were numb, but I could tell they were strapped down as I began to regain feeling in my fingers and toes. Breathing started to become slightly easier, however it was still an involuntary task- i had to force myself to breath. It started to dawn on me- I had finally done it.  I had finally OD‚Äôd. I was in an ambulance and would shortly be in a jail hospital.

‚ÄúXANAX,‚Äù I wheezed in a panic. I had a prescription for Xanax, and my oxygen starved brain thought I could trick them into thinking that was all I had taken.

Fact was, according to the last thing I remember, the three of us were waiting at a bus stop for a 3rd mobile dealer after the first two fell through (imagine that). I was a ball of anxiety drenched in sweat on a chilly fall day, and my pupils were so dilated you could see into my soul if it weren‚Äôt for the dopesick tears flowing out of my eyes. 

Chances of copping anytime soon were looking grimmer by the second, so I popped the emergency 2mg Xanax bar I always keep on me. I‚Äôve got a prescription(read: tolerance). Didn‚Äôt know how long this was going to take, and I needed anything to take the edge off. You know that exact feeling.

I had copped from this dude before with no out of the ordinary issues, but he was the paranoid type- something was always off with him. I chalked it up to the the fact that I was the only white person for miles on the southside of a very large city known prominently for drugs and violence. I stood out. Literally everyone knew why I was there, and literally nobody cared.

After what seemed days, my buddy got the call. He‚Äôs an old head, black dude, so they trust him. I‚Äôll throw him a bag to cop for me so I don‚Äôt have to get in and out of a car or deal with stone cold killers face to face. Plus he‚Äôs got connections- he grew up in that neighborhood. It‚Äôs worth it.

Finally- glory! It was here! That feeling when he dropped the bags into my hand- I don‚Äôt have to describe the excitement because you know exactly the feeling I speak of. I was feeling generous after the ordeal and we were both sick as snot, so I rolled up a dollar bill popped open a bag of fluffy white powder and split it with him while we walked. 

Sweet relief.

We went our separate ways and I busted out another bag as I was walking towards the train. I always have a bag on my walk to the train to get me well. I put that up my nose with no problem- in fact it was amazing. One of the best tasting bags ever. You know how the sicker you are, the better it is when you finally do get right? Or how the best high in the world is after giving up hope because the odds of it coming thru are one and a million... and then it *actually* does? Those feelings multiplied by each other with some Xanax sprinkled on top.

I was at the point tolerance wise where i was copping 10 bags at a time, and one was just enough to normalize me. 10 would be gone in a day if I had money. I wasn‚Äôt worried about that half bag we split. Or the 2mg of Xanax I had taken. Or the last-resort-shady-dealer who provides the white powder (pretty common in this area).*Why the fuck would I have a single worry at all- I had 10 bags in my hand!!!!!!*

I made quick work of the bag. Bill rolled up, inside bag, inside palm of my hand and walking through city traffic nobody bats an eye. Makes me confident as ever- even cocky. And just as I‚Äôm walking around the corner..... I wake up in an ambulance with super glue in my lungs, suffocating........

‚ÄúRAOUL, can you hear me? Xanax and what else? I NEED to know what you took and HOW MUCH you took.‚Äù

My breath was slowing coming back but i could still feel my lungs touching. I had no concept of time. I was literally fighting to breath. The rest of my body was still numb and I couldn‚Äôt see.

‚ÄúI CANT GO BACK TO JAIL,‚Äù I muttered.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna go to jail we just need to know how much you took. We are trying to save your life.‚Äù

‚ÄúI CANT *wheeze* GO BACK TO JAIL!‚Äù

Rinse and repeat. I went back and forth with the EMTs like this for the entire ride. I finally regained feeling in my hand and checked my jean pocket- the 9 bags were gone.

They wheeled me into the hospital and my vision was starting to come back. I refused to give them any personal information. I refused treatment. They had a police officer put on gloves and give me a *very* reluctant ‚Äúpat down.‚Äù

I was taken aback at how quick and light the pat down was. 5 seconds long, just a quick pat on the belt loop and shoulders. I was wearing a teeshirt and no belt.... I‚Äôve had tighter security going into concerts. At this point I was starting to realize there MIGHT be a chance I wasn‚Äôt going to jail.

I kept asking if I was free to go. They said yes but naturally they didn‚Äôt recommend it and used all the words they could to keep me there. I did agree to wait for the doctor to come by. He did, and Doc told me I had stopped breathing, turned blue and had technically died. He told me if I refused to stay there I was going to go back out there and kill myself. 

Doc told me I didn‚Äôt know how lucky I was.  I didn‚Äôt know how lucky I was, because the thought that went through my head was, oh-so-familiar- *I‚Äôm a heroin addict. I‚Äôm invincible.* Get me the fuck out of here. That was my thought process- sound familiar? My ungrateful ass had fulfilled my duty to speak with the doctor and decided it was time to haul ass before they changed their mind. So i started to scoot out of the hospital bed.

At that moment I realized why the cop barely searched me (besides the fact they already had my dope). I had full blown shit myself. Like a hot milkshake spread all over my both my asscheeks. I felt it spread as I squished out of the hospital bed. The smell- you can only imagine.  I don‚Äôt know if you can imagine. No cop wants to deal with dope fiend OD shit in their cruiser.

One bathroom, one industrial roll of toilet paper, one bottle of hand sanitizer one hour and negative 1 pair of underwear and I was out of there. 

While still on hospital grounds I called my middle man, ‚ÄúWhere you at? Yeah im still high. High as fuck. But I just went through some SHIT and I need a few more bags to be on the safe side- I‚Äôm not trying to get sick.‚Äù

I had no idea if the Narcan was gonna kick in later or if it had run it‚Äôs course. All I knew was I had a date that night I couldn‚Äôt miss so I couldn‚Äôt risk getting sick. I copped 4 more bags from my regular guy and ended up puking every hour for the rest of the night- with my angel of a date who thought I was just regular sick. I thought it was the Narcan at the time, but I‚Äôm guessing Narcan didn‚Äôt rip the all the fent off my brain so I was still high and Unnecessarily sniffing more powder. Or it could have been my body recovering from (possible) death.

I genuinely don‚Äôt know how lucky I was. I don‚Äôt feel lucky- I‚Äôm still a heroin addict.

End of story.


***Serious question- in your opinion/experiences- do you think I really died or was that a scare tactic they used on me? It‚Äôs all pretty hazy besides the details I outlined above which are pretty vivid memories.  I don‚Äôt remember falling out. The xanax bar plus he hot bag was what did me in. If I wasn‚Äôt in a busy metropolitan city in the midst of an opioid epidemic I‚Äôm certain I would be dead. I just don‚Äôt know if I actually died. What do you guys think? Stay safe!

Please excuse any format/grammar/spelling issues- i typed this all on mobile and didn‚Äôt go back for a proof read. 

Morale of the story- DO NOT MIX BENZOS AND OPIATES and ALWAYS START SMALL TO TEST YOUR BATCH! LIVE BY THIS RULE AND YOU MAY CONTINUE TO LIVE!!!! STAY SAFE!!!!!!!

GHB is liquid: .2g/ML. Total intake so far around 10-12 ML, and minimal effects.

There‚Äôs a second person with no opioid use, but regularly takes gabapentanoids like Lyrica, and formerly abused Phenibut. This person takes benzos daily and has been weaning down from n2mg klonopin daily. Did not dose klonopin prior to taking GHB and has had 15 ML with no noticeable effects. 


Re-dosing likely. Seeking advice for either person. If you have knowledge of this subject any harm reduction tips would mean a lot. Is there a safe way to potentiate GHB?

And yes I was getting high quality black. Also keep in mind that I wasn't an IV user of either. I'd snort oxies (smoking them is a rediculous waste imo even though it does feel great but only lasts 30 minutes as opposed to snorting which lasts about 4 hours) and smoke the h. I did have one friend that says he preferred oxies and hydros to smoking h. BUT he would say that tar is only truly euphoric for him if iv'd and he did prefer that to the other opiates.




Oxies gave me much more euphoria and I loved the energy aspect to it. I started smoking black tar once I couldn't afford 15 Roxie's a day. Smoking the tar literally gave me almost no euphoria. Why is this? I'm the only one I know that preferred oxys. I'd of much rather crushed up 4 or 5 Roxie's to snort than smoke .2-.3 of black. What are your opinions about this?




One more question..  Is China white heroin or fentanyl? Seems to be a lot of confusion on that for me. I did try iv'd China white only once and I honestly wasn't impressed. Maybe the quality was low or it could have been because I was tweaking at the time I tried this, so maybe that took away from it?

I've come to this sub tons of time for advice and learned everything about opiates and more importantly harm reduction from you guys. For a long time you guys were my only people to talk to about this shit. I got started the same way lots of people do, had a surgery and it was just codeine, but I'm the type of person who just wants to get fucked up, but was too scared to get actual drugs I guess. Opiates were my first drug and I loved them instantly. Once I used up my supply I thought that was that but you guys know how it goes. Another surgery, a family member, old pills, all that good stuff. I never used enough to get physically addicted, I typically used for a few weeks in a row just on weekends with month or two long breaks in between. Still, I was psychologically addicted and that's enough. I eventually started to use a bit more, buying pills now, getting high on weekends and it got harder to keep it that way. I began getting depressed on days that I wasn't getting high and quit for a bit, but the depression lasted. I hadn't used that much, I had been taking methadone to get high 2 times a week for 2 months when I was 16, never building up any tolerance but still being an addict in my own way. I was still depressed after a few months and ended up taking oxy after getting my wisdom teeth out. By now only my closest friends knew and only because I told them. This had stayed hidden from my family and anyone I didn't want to know. I was alone, none of them had ever touched anything so while they were kind, they didn't really get it. After another short break I needed more, but all I could find was heroin. So I took the plunge. I bought heroin and started snorting it. It was only half a gram but I had developed little to no tolerance due to how often I took breaks (30mg of Oxy still got me where I wanted to be). I only ever bought it once because I realized what was happening. I was up one night high for the third night in a row when I saw what was going on. I was watching Bojack and >!Sarah Lin died!<. The scene just hit me so hard. I realized that this was my last chance. If I didn't stop right now, this second, shit would end up outside of my control. It was just this moment of clarity and I just knew I had to stop. So I flushed what I had left (about a third of the half gram) and quit right there and then. I was 17 at this point and it was October.

Right after quitting was hard. Really hard. I wanted to give up but I stuck through it. I didn't even have physical withdraws but I still craved it everyday. After a month it seemed like the universe decided I was worthy. I met my girlfriend. She is my first girlfriend and we're still together today. She helped me so much. If I didn't have her I would have certainly relapsed. I literally thought about how if we broke up it would be OK because I could finally have heroin again. But she got me past that point. She took care of me and helped me and eventually I no longer wanted heroin. I knew that if I even had it in my face I could say no. It was great. We have/had our issues. I helped her with her own mental health (not drug related) and things were good. In July my dad had back pain. My family never knew about my addiction. I kept it hidden from them and they knew nothing. So when he kept a bottle of hydros on the counter it seemed perfectly fine. Why would he need to put them where it was a pain to get to ya know? For the first 2 weeks I was ok. My girlfriend talked me though things and I was ok. Eventually it got harder. It's one thing to say no once, or twice, or for a week. But everyday gets too hard. Moving the pills didn't help, they had been in my mind for too long. I was getting too taxing on my GF. And so I relapsed. I got high and my family noticed the missing pills. They had finally found out. They were devastated. I ended up telling them about the past and they were crushed. My gf was devastated. She ended up self harming for the first time and that started a battle for her that she is still struggling with. I can never forget how badly I hurt the people I care about the most. How my family was shocked. My gf looked like she was at deaths door. It was so horrible. And it makes me so mad at myself. If I had quit heroin just like that I would have been proud of stopping. It was on my own terms and I did because I decided to. I would be almost 2 years sober today instead of just now hitting 1. This is just a reminder of the day I got too weak and hurt the people I love. They don't blame me anymore, but I still blame me. I can't be proud of this no matter how badly I want to be. Idk if anyone else goes through shit like this, ik my situation is no where near as bad as most peoples but it still sucks and I feel like you guys are the only people who can really understand. Thanks for listening to my ramblings. ",1533180008.0

She‚Äôd been nodded out until we got to northern Alabama. Once we stopped there, she made me buy obscene amounts of candy and soda. She also asked me to check the oil when I put gas in, but she stayed in the car. There was barely any oil on the dipstick. What was there was black like coffee left on a hot pot all day. It looked chunky. I said,

‚ÄúYeah. It looks great, baby,‚Äù from under the hood. I was about finished with her anyway. I could feel the monster trying to claw himself free from the box inside of my brain. She wouldn‚Äôt fair well, if he got out, and she pulled the things she did. Anyway, it wouldn‚Äôt matter once I got away from her whether the car had oil or not. That would be her problem.

After driving 13 hours Gabriella and I spent the night in a hotel on the coast of Alabama. I rented the room at the office and opened it for her. The day had gone well. Of course, there was the typical bickering. She was always good for that. In the room, there wasn‚Äôt much heroin left, and since I hadn‚Äôt gotten a habit going since I relapsed with her, I let her have it. I was just happy to be out of Ohio where no one was watching the news that offered a reward for information leading to my arrest.

The blue and green flicker of the TV glowed through the curtains in our room. I sat on the beach in the moonlight and listened to the surf breaking on the sand and thought about Oregon and Arizona. I had never been to either state and both had cities where the street life was happening, or so I‚Äôd heard. Arizona would be warmer and drier. Oregon had a certain pull on me, even though it would be wet and cold. It was a place I‚Äôd wanted to go since I was a kid. Both had plenty of heroin according to all reports I ever got.

The prospect of leaving her and going back to the streets put a warm lump of hope or nostalgia or something sentimental, and I walked back to the room. She was sleeping when I opened the door. A movie played on HBO. I fell asleep quickly.

Now, I don‚Äôt know where she got the clothes iron, but she did. She may have brought it. It may have been a part of the room. I‚Äôm not sure about where it came from. I just know that the distinct sound of my own skin‚Äôs moisture popping against the hot metal held to my forehead woke me up that morning. Gabriella was up. We had no connections in Alabama. I‚Äôd lied about Florida. So, she burned me with the iron. I can‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt expected, or at least something like it.

I pulled my pants on. I ran for the door. Rain fell in freezing drops the size of grapes from the sky and a wind ripped up the street as I walked faster. Everything with her and leaving my sister and being so weak caught up to me, and as hard as I fought it, I cried. I bawled in the rain walking down the street in just my jeans. A car pulled up behind me and then slowly creeped along with me. Maybe they would help. Maybe they‚Äôd have an answer or ask me to get in and take me far away from my life and myself and everything else I hated so much and couldn‚Äôt figure out, but when I turned towards them, a middle-aged man with a crew cut leaned over the steering wheel to see past his wife, who was gawking from the passenger seat. A child pointed and smiled from the back. I moaned pathetically and reached out towards them and stumbled to put my face to the window and beg for their help.  It was as if I could sense their humanity bubbling up within their chests so that they would, so that they must help this pitiful, half naked creature crying like a child in the freezing rain -- me.

My senses must have been wrong, though. The mother reached back to hide the child‚Äôs eyes from seeing me, and the engine revved. Tail pipe blasted smog at my face. Tires splashed cold gutter water all over me. I cried harder and decided to walk back to the hotel. At least there, I would be able to sit on the balcony outside of the room where it was dry. Maybe Gabriella would let me in.

The curtains were closed. The lights were off from what I could tell. It looked like no one was in the room when I got back. I leaned over the railing and let my tear drops fall to the pavement below. A one-story drop wouldn‚Äôt even break my legs, maybe sprain an ankle, but there was no way I could expect the fall to kill me. Then, I looked towards the sea. I‚Äôve never been a very good swimmer. The storm had caused the waves to break violently against the shore. All I would have to do is swim towards the horizon for as long as I could. There was no way I would be able to make it back.

Before I could make the stairs, a pair of young black men wearing torn white tshirts on their heads like bandanas met me as they were coming out of their room. They took one look at me and asked,

‚ÄúWhatsa poblem? Why you cryin‚Äô? You a mon. Don‚Äô cry.‚Äù

They asked me if I was a ‚ÄúJesus person.‚Äù They asked me if I liked ‚Äúda Boy.‚Äù Both questions confused me, but soon I got it figured out. The answers were no and yes respectively.

I said, ‚ÄúNo. Not a Jesus person. Yes. I like da boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome in. You have money.‚Äù I think it was a question, like he was asking if I had money. It just didn‚Äôt sound like one. And I did have money.

In the room, they sat me in a chair at the small table against the wall and produced a brittle, brown brick the size of a wallet. They cut a bit off and put it on the table. I couldn‚Äôt even see what they‚Äôd given me, but I trusted it was there and put my nose to it and snorted. My eyes watered. I got queasy.

‚ÄúYou like dat mon.‚Äù It was supposed to be another question. I nodded and stumbled towards the door and puked over the balcony. They didn‚Äôt ask for any money. They just said they‚Äôd be there if I wanted more.

I woke up covered in the white beach sand grit. An angry Gabriella was standing over me. It was getting dark and had quit raining at some point. All I could remember, though, were the two Jamaicans or Haitians or whoever they were pulling me into their room. Gabriella said I needed to go pay for another night. She‚Äôd been locked out and looking for me all day, so she said. I could tell by her voice that she‚Äôd gotten something somewhere. Maybe all the dope she didn‚Äôt do or share with me from the day before. I don‚Äôt know.

The next morning started off better. It was sunny and warmer. She didn‚Äôt wake me up by burning the skin off my face or turn any other appliances into medieval torture devices. She hadn‚Äôt started a fight, even. We went to breakfast at a diner down the street. I wore a pair of cheap aviators I‚Äôd stolen from a gas station a few days before. In my mind, somehow, the glasses were a disguise to keep people from noticing the piece of burned flesh on my forehead, hanging off like a gnarly piece of dried out pepperoni, all curled up and black and green and crusty. It didn‚Äôt work. The glasses only covered my eyes. I knew that. The waitress and anyone else who saw me that morning did a double take and stared awkwardly at it when they talked to me. A fatter man and his pretty wife at another table gave me a look of understanding, like he knew exactly what had happened when he saw it. It made me feel better though, to wear the glasses. So, I did.

When we got back to the room, the two men I‚Äôd seen the day before were standing outside of the room. Gabriella was wearing those gym shorts that must have belonged to a skinny 8th grader, and they choked her thighs and butt in a way that made it hard for men not to look. One man slapped the other‚Äôs shoulder and pointed at her as we entered the room. Inside of the room, she asked me where we could score.

‚ÄúI know you were high yesterday, Clyde.‚Äù

I told her to wait in the room and went back to the other room. The two men were standing outside waiting for me. There were 50 bucks left in my pocket, and they gave me a generous portion of the fuzzy looking granules in three gel caps for it. That was the last of the money.

‚ÄúHey, mon, we like you chick.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt know here well enough, then, mon.‚Äù I laughed, trying to do my best islander accent. They didn‚Äôt understand.

‚ÄúWe pay. We take her. Our boat comes at sunrise, tomorrow.‚Äù They didn‚Äôt want her for the night. I‚Äôd never had a chick like that long enough to let one pay for our dope that way anyway, but they wanted something more permanent.

‚ÄúLet me think about it. I‚Äôll come see you later.‚Äù

The truth is that I would have never sold Gabriella to the Haitians or Jamaicans or whatever they were. She was terrible to me. The last two or three days, though, were good. Well, they were okay, and you‚Äôd have to forget about the incident with the iron to say that. Something inside of me loved her still. Something inside of me wanted to make it work with her and held onto the moments when she was just a little less crappy so that it could work. Maybe, I was just weak. Anyone else would have left her. I never would have. There‚Äôs no question about it, but Boom Boom on the other hand, well, he‚Äôs a different story.

She did most of the dope in the capsules. I only did a little and got sick. Gabriella woke me up in the middle of the night. She was naked and sweet and sweating soon after that. We had fun. We shared a cigarette in bed, glistening in the dark and blew smoke at the ceiling. She started a shower. *This was it.* I thought. *This was love.* She was not who she‚Äôd been, really. I‚Äôd finally found it, the thing called love, that I‚Äôd so desperately pined for. My mother was all I had ever known of it, and she was gone. A warm spring of hope and happiness babbled in my chest. Angels were singing. This was love, but in the shower, she farted in my mouth, again. She even laughed, like it was cute.

Now, it‚Äôs always difficult explaining the whole Boom Boom thing to people, because obviously, he and I exist in the same body. It‚Äôs just not clear exactly where the line is drawn. There are somethings about Clyde, that are the same about Boom Boom. So, maybe, it‚Äôs not necessarily two distinct personalities but severely altered versions of the same person. Like I said, it‚Äôs difficult to explain, and it‚Äôs also difficult to know exactly when the line is crossed from Clyde to Boom Boom or Boom Boom to Clyde. I just know it was some time after she farted in my mouth in the shower and laughed.

She watched TV. I told her I‚Äôd be back with some more heroin and went to visit the men. They were up. The payment filled a cigarette cellophane so fully that when I melted it shut at the top with my lighter, some of the dope got melted into it. I wrapped it in a napkin for safety, deciding to revisit the packaging situation once Gabriella was gone.

‚ÄúBabes, look what they gave me!‚Äù

‚ÄúWHAT! No way!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. The guys are just a few doors down. They say they want to meet you personally. I gotta take a dump, though, so just go on over. You‚Äôll see ‚Äòem. Their door is open.‚Äù Those were the last words I ever spoke to her.

As the sun came up, I sat on the balcony. It was beautiful. I had walked to the 24-hour grocery store and bought a six pack of root beer in glass bottles. It was for the toast. You know, I would stick a needle in my veins with the most poisonous chemical concoctions you could dream up, if it would get me off, but I hated alcohol.

Their door opened. It looked like Gabriella was lethargic from whatever drugs she‚Äôd done with them, but it was hard to tell. She had a pillowcase over her head and duct tape around her neck. Her hands were bound behind her back, and the men were strong besides. She didn‚Äôt give much fight physically, but for a few kicks here and there. I could hear her muffled screams. I imagined she was saying my name.

There was a buzzing in the distance getting louder and closer all the time. Eventually, a rickety long boat made of what looked like trash pushed onto the shore from the water. The men took Gabriella, gagged and bound, over their shoulders and into the boat. I lifted my bottle of root beer to the men. They waved back, and the driver let off his horn. That was our toast.

I don‚Äôt know whatever happened to her. Maybe, she lives still in some Haitian rape dungeon. Maybe, she was chopped up into pieces and sold for the price of her organs. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt care, but I do know that I remembered that notebook with the stories in it, as the boat road off into the vast expanse of the see. It was in the car, so I went to get it.

I opened it on the hood and let the sun warm my neck and head as I read the last story in it. My palms were on the car and fingers splayed. It was called, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never see that house again.‚Äù Whoever wrote it must have written it about their grandmother and her house. It went like this.

*I‚Äôll never see that house again.*

*And I won‚Äôt see her either.*

*We spent every summer there and, in the mornings, she cooked pancakes in bacon grease from a mason jar or biscuits and sausage with strawberry preserves. We drank cold milk from the plastic cups from the shelf under her set of olive-green colony glass tea tumblers she‚Äôd had since the 1970s.*

*We watched cartoons with older cousins after breakfast or made tree forts anywhere on the five acres she kept sequestered from the new neighborhoods and traffic with trees and brush. There was a club house on the side of the garden in the field. It had windows and a door. It was where our uncle molested us.*

*It was where my own father grew up, way back when the road was only one lane and made of gravel. He told me the front yard had been a dense, dark forest of cane when he was a kid. That was hard to believe. He told me the day he came home from the hospital, the pipes froze at the house and his head had been mangled by the forceps they used to deliver him. ‚ÄúI always wondered what my daddy thought that day,‚Äù he used to tell me, not that he remembered it, but he knew the story. ‚ÄúI always wondered what my daddy thought, coming home from the hospital, his son looking like some purple, smashed face monkey with a busted head and ice all over the kitchen floor.‚Äù Things had been different then.*

*My grandmother cut her own field until the day she broke her leg. She slipped on a clip from a clothes hanger at the department store looking for a deal. It was the end of her. Physical therapy had been too much. She never got out of the wheelchair. Eventually, one of her eyes went caddywompas‚Äîin her own words‚Äîmeaning it went sideways while the other looked straight. We suspected it was from all the Tab she drank in the 1980s. Too much aspartame.*

*She was known to cry over nothing. Once she started weeping at the kitchen sink, because there was an airplane in the sky out the window and the people inside of it had just said goodbye to all the people they loved before boarding. Her face was as ugly as a face can get when it came to crying.*

*She liked to say, ‚ÄúWell, ain‚Äôt that a bunch of sh\*t.‚Äù It usually was.*

*She accused people of ‚Äúflim flamming her.‚Äù They usually were.*

*She accused the grandkids of always being one step ahead of her. We definitely were.*

*She used to sip Diet Coke from a glass and chew ice cubes or a toothpick when she sat on her love seat next to a pile of outdated tabloids. She sowed all the curtains in the house, in the 60s. She told me how she‚Äôd set the kitchen on fire once and how the finish on the cabinets wasn‚Äôt the original. It had all been burned off in the fire.*

*She died though. Rolled that wheel chair to the end of her long hallway, crawled into bed and died.*

*Was it cold?*

*Was she scared?*

*Did she cry out or did something visit her when it happened?*

*Now, her children are selling the property and house. It‚Äôs five acres. A strange redhaired couple with an Indonesian financer came to look at it. They wore collared shirts that had emblems of two triangles and the letter S running through them. The place will be sold to Scientologists. It will be one of their compounds.*

*I can see her now, sitting on her love chair and looking up from the paper to say, ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt that a bunch of sh\*t?‚Äù*

*I'll never see her again, though.*

*And I won't see that house, either.*

When I finished the story, I turned around and fell back onto the hood of the car. A skinny blond woman in flip flops and shorts with a large, Fleur delis tattoo on her shoulder and a red skinned, kinky haired baby in her arms asked me for a cigarette.

‚ÄúSure. They‚Äôre in my room, though. You‚Äôll have to follow me.‚Äù

‚ÄúK.‚Äù She waited outside of the door. Her eye was swollen shut and turning a shiny greenish black color. ‚ÄúAre you leaving town?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere you going?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you take me with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. I need it. What‚Äôs your name anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is‚Ä¶..‚Äù I was about to say Clyde, but I adjusted, ‚ÄúYou can call me Boom Boom.‚Äù",1533179385.0

TL;DR: AT the bottom. 

It took me so many months to finally schedule this test at $30 a test, 4 test and I‚Äôm finally taking my second ones. I‚Äôm going through a lot of arguing in my relationship all week (7 days for sure) and the test is tomorrow and she is aware and stress is my biggest distraction *when it comes to people I love. Especially when they take up all my hours of my days talking about suicide and had to stop an attempt this morning*

That being said, I‚Äôm afraid to sleep home with my partner (I‚Äôm male, she‚Äôs female probably doesn‚Äôt matter gender), I would feel less stressed and safer being over my cousins but my girlfriend will get spite and mean if I even mention walking to the corner store for water even with 90+ days free of opiates except last night because I couldn‚Äôt cope with the hours of stress she put on me and stopping a suicide attempt that triggered my PTSD of dead parents from suicide and tried my hardest to cope and it took over completely.

So I‚Äôm off my Suboxone for 3 days now I believe and I relapsed yesterday. This test is so important to me because without a GED, no military for me. Or any college that I could afford.

Having took 450mg morphine ER chewed last night with 2mg Pharmacy Xanax and didn‚Äôt even feel it kick in until I was sleeping, basically, and upon awakening because I slept in an opiate position with severe shoulder pain and stuff in my mouth like I threw up in my sleep (thankful I didn‚Äôt die) and Suboxone not blocking my receptors. Basically took 180mg morph. First then the remaining 270mg morph at night, confused why I didn‚Äôt feel it as strong.

Also will mention in the TL;DR below all the meds I have access to that may help. 

*TL;DR: Finally scheduled GED tests to get into military/college, girlfriend of 5 years I love and live with being controlling and extremely stressed. Had over 90+ days clean from opiates/drugs except Suboxone my maintenance med until last night, seeing her attempt suicide triggered me and relapsed of 450mg oral morphine. I really need to past this test tomorrow and I need peaceful sleep, little to no stress so I can focus and my cousins house offers me that, but my girl practically doesn‚Äôt let me leave the house at all and I‚Äôm always with her and got off Oxy/Morphine for her ‚Äîall after both partners dying and I‚Äôm now 20. I need to take an opioid to focus such as Oxycodone that I can acquire but all I have is buprenorphine (Suboxone). Here‚Äôs meds below that I have and I need advice about this whole sleeping out stress free when communication failed please thank you.*

I have: At least x30 Valium 2mg 
I don‚Äôt exceed 10-20mg 

x12 Adderall 20mg IR (I don‚Äôt abuse)
I Only take 1 tablet 

Over x60 Klonopin 1mg 
(I won‚Äôt exceed 2mg)

x10 real/pharmaceutical made 
Xanax 2mg (I only take for emergencies)

x12 Suboxone tablet 8/2mg
(Was only taking 2mg twice daily)


*Will morphine, buprenorphine, Oxycodone or hydrocodone help me focus more and what dosage to not nod off? And take with or without my Adderall?*

ALL of your advice on ALL of this will help me out so much for not only tomorrow‚Äôs test but the other 2 in following weeks!!!!!!!",1533178599.0

He had a girlfriend or a wife, and would occasionaly go to work, that is, pilote planes on heroin. He used to just snort and didn't take too much before work, just enough to be well, since he couldn't work high without risking a plane crash. In this particular day, he decided to wrap the dope on foil and take it with him in his pocket or in his hand baggage. What he really wanted was to make the flight and then go to his hotel to get high.

What could go wrong, uh? After all, airplane pilots were searched or supervised rarely, only a few times. Well, that day ended up being on one of those rare occasions in which pilots are checked.

The dope on foil was found and his excuse was that that was vitamin powder. He said he couldn't take the vitamin capsules for some reason that I'm not sure, so his doctor told him to take the vitamin powder off the capsules and take just the powder. Agents were called and started interrogating him to see if he would contradict himself in his excuse. He was trained to go through situations of tension and pression, so he would answear fast and never contradicted anything he already mentioned before. The agents thought the H was crack (???), and after much tension he was dispensed. He had gotten away!

So he was relieved and decided to make this reddit post telling us this story with an alternate account, since he commented on flight/ plane/ pilots subs though his main account. When he was answearing the comments, that motherfuker accidentally entered his original main account to comment, so then we ""knew"" who this guy was and he could be caught more easily. Fucking nuts!

I remember there were people in the comments telling him he would be soon tested for drugs, so that he should detox. There were people saying it was stupid for him to do that post. And there were people shocked that there are pilots out there piloting planes on heroin. I understand the people who were shocked, but I guess if he was doing only enough to get well before work, not actually flying planes high on dope, well, that may not be the ideal situation, but it's better than him flying planes while withdrawling. Talk about a crazy story. It didn't take long for him to delete the post. Anyone else remember this? Please tell me I'm not the only one who remember that post!",1533169739.0

---


My first encounter with heroin was age 10

I wrote a song for my band, picked up my pad and with my pen

I scribbled ""chasing the dragon"" at the top of the page

Wanted to be famous, wanted to get up on that stage

Wanted to speak of things I'd never played with before

Wanted to get into to the game, wanted to go on tour

When I was twelve I learned my brother was in jail

Five years, cocaine, tried to be Escobar but failed

By that point two years I knew I was destined

Obsessed with coke cause drugs are interesting

Learned about ozzy osbourne and his special predilection

School was easy, grades were good

But the temptation was festering




It's easy to look at someone and say it's your fault

But do we really deserve the pain and the insult?

We all fucking know we're not good role models

And with the gamble and the money it's like playing the lotto

When misguided youth turn to using the needle

Don't treat em like animals, cause we're all still people




The first drug I tried was an XR Adderall

Turned eleven and couldn't give a single fuck at all

At school, sold my best friend a bag of Tylenol

Charged 20 dollars and spent the money at the mall

Next day I'm approached, and I'm thinking ""oh fuck""

He said ""man, the high was good, but the taste, it sucks""

I told him, ""I know, the expensive coke is better.""

For years I followed that scheme to the letter

Then one day, teenage, I tried a bag of coke

Fast forward a month later, I was sniffing dope

Selling bags of ice to fiends and bumming packs of smokes

Not old enough to drive, on the weekends I blew meth smoke,

I thought: man, life is so much better when you're nodding and getting high 

Had the needle in my arm when tolerance multiplied




It's easy to look at someone and say it's your fault

But do we really deserve the pain and the insult?

We all fucking know we're not good role models

And with the gamble and the money it's like playing the lotto

When misguided youth turn to using the needle

Don't treat em like animals, cause we're all still people




I bet you still think that I wanted this for myself

That I wanted to care about drugs over my health 

That's why society is fucked, we're still fucking people,

We're not drug addicts all because we're fucking evil,

It's not true, I swear I'm the sweetest fucking person,

Yall looking at me like my hobby is committing arson,

And I'm supposed to be cool with that, it's fine?

I'm the scum of the earth because I liked being high?

Fuck that, take a look at your own fucking parents,

It's not okay because drinking's where the cash's spent,

So back it up before you cast the first stone,

I'm sure you have some sins for which you should atone.

So I got pretty addicted back in 2015ish. Got on buprenorphine slowly tapered down from 4mg to 0.6mg a day. Recently, a few months ago, I was put on weekly pick ups. Was great at first but I've been struggling with taking my doses daily and not snorting doses to get that meagre ""high"". It's sort of culminated in me using (oral morphine) again ""just to get through"" to when I can pick up my weekly allowance of buprenorphine. For what it's worth I'm aware of how much of a dickhead I am, and I'm gonna quit my bullshit and start taking the buprenoprhine I'm prescribed properly from tomorrow, when I pick up my weekly allowance.

I'm aware that buprenorphine can block full agonists. I last took buprenorphine yesterday, 0.4mg snorted. I thought at such a low dose I wouldn't notice much blocking. When I first took the morphine today I felt that really heavy feeling in my arms and legs, and my nose and eyes dried up, stomach settled down, etc. Even a little euphoria, or at least physical pleasure. But subsequent redoses seem to have had no effect, even to the point where I feel like I'm in withdrawals now. Is this normal? Why would I be in withdrawals if I keep redosing morphine? Can the buprenorphine block the full agonist from working but at the same time be too little to keep you out of withdrawals? I feel strange. I can feel the morphine working a little bit, but I also feel like I'm in withdrawals at the same time.

Should I take a .2mg buprenorphine to see what happens? I'm pretty scared of precipitated withdrawals, but if I feel like I'm in withdrawal it should be ok right? Or are those words I'm gonna regret? I'm leaning towards no because I can just about feel the effects of the morphine, but my back is aching like a mofo and I'm sweating for no reason... Just feel like I'm both slightly high and in withdrawals at the same time, it's very strange... 

I guess the lesson to learn would be don't fuck around when on maintenance meds.

93s2ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/93s2ru/life_is_alright_at_4am/,4,https://redd.it/93s2ru,sloan_fitch,Life is alright at 4am,"Last night just after 4am I was biking home from working on an ongoing project with a friend as well as viewing episodes of SG1. Mostly a quiet ride, I did not get a chance to watch a street resurfacer do it's thing as I did earlier that evening. I did however get to ride my bike over roughly stripped roads which will soon be paved over to complete the resurfacing process.

&nbsp;

Within the final half mile as I turned off a main thoroughfare onto a main sidestreet, I saw what appeared to a kid on a bike. What is a twelve year old doing riding a bicycle at 4am? Well, whatever.. he ain't a trickster or a showoff so at least I don't have to worry about being served. You know, like when someone break dances better than you and you have no comeback. That's what happens when someone pops a wheelie around me. It's not really my riding style and although I've done some tricky maneuvers on my bike that require  fancy foot work but usually only when it's practical to do so. Jump a curb, cut diagonally across a golf course and the occasional jaunt through the woods. 


&nbsp;


**The kid on the bike** was maintaining a steady velocity so I decided increase mine and pass on the left. As I was already three car lengths ahead and acclerating my name is called, ""hey sloansoid."" I look and I realize, that twelve year old on a bike is actually Derrick. He's small like that, mostly short. Actually has fair muscle tone, though Tim still believes he could beat the shit out of him but that's another story and a theory that will hopefully never be tested. You know, in the name of peace. 


&nbsp;


Being the courteous individual that I am, I slowed down and circled back. My velocity was so great that I had to do two 360s before Derrick had caught up with me. From there, I was practically coasting and still moving faster. It wasn't difficult but it took a concious effort to brake and match his velocity. Wonder why he was out biking at 4am?


&nbsp;


**It became abundantly clean when** he pointed at it was Tuesday at at 4am. Well, technically Wednesday but the new day starts when I wake up as far as I'm concerned. What happens at 4am on Wednesdays? Cliff or his mom gets paid. I'm not really sure who's pay day it is since it all goes to the same account in his mom's name. For all I know all of the money is due for her and Cliff is making up the existence of his monthly disability money. When we used to hang out he would refer to one of his monthly direct deposits as ""big money"", such as ""Wednesday is my big money day."" An example being, ""Do you have $40 I can borrow, I got you next Wednesday, that's when I get my big money.""


&nbsp;


**What is abundantly clear?** Derrick was biking on his way back from the ATM with Cliff's card and money. The next phase of the operation for him was to meet up with his plug. We parted ways at the corner, I took the slightly more scenic route home in order ensure that I did not stumble into Cliff. Before parting ways I wished Derrick luck with timing - we all know what it can be like waiting for our respective plugs. When I got home I saw Derrick pulling into his driveway a few houses down - he must've stopped off at Cliff's on the way back to drop off the debit card or something. He often has to bike to the plug but if he was going home I suspect the plug was coming to him that night. 



&nbsp;

That last part doesn't really matter to me. I'm glad not being part of the equation anymore. Last few times I was involved for the 4am pick-up were factors in my choice to stop doing dope altogether. Even w hen I had used my own plugs, it was hard for me not to avail myself for a couple of free bags although I eventually concluded the price was too high for that benefit. There was always a ""gotcha"" or ""by the way"" when dealing with Cliff in what should be a simple endeavor. 



&nbsp;


Sometimes I'd hang out for four hours beforehand, but with the advent of bed bugs the couch became inhospitable. As the infestation got worse, even metal chairs at the kitchen table were no longer safe! I'd see the little buggers on my shirt and pick them off individually, I'd get home, strip down in my freezing backyard and hold my shirt up to the light to see a juvenile bug. I once hung out for four hours binging of Stargate Universe a series I never really watched prior. I watched soldiers in a desert while I wore my winter coat indoors. That very coat is still in my backyard, I've never taken it inside my home again since that night. 



&nbsp;

Without reflecting and recanting past events which I'm saving for another post, I am just glad. Just because Cliff would get paid at 4am didn't mean I'd have my dope by 5am. It always took longer for different reasons. On one occaisons Derrick told Cliff he wanted to stop at home on the way back, get straight and the deliver the dope wheras Cliff would demand delivery first. Derrick would argue that he put the effort in and should be entitled to that. Then there's the other fact, Cliff preferred Derrick to deliver all of the dope first so that he could select choose and distribute Derrick's earnings. 


&nbsp;


There was always a push-pull between Cliff and Derrick regarding timing and expectations. The results of which would inevitably funnel down to me. Seeing Derrick last night once again reminded me of how great it is not to depend on the whims of other individuals at 4am to get doep. I mean yeah, I still depend on the whims of other individuals but at least I have a greater sense of control since Suboxone is a longer acting opioid. If someone is two days late on delivery of goods during a busy work week - things no longer spiral rapidly out of control. None of that feeling anxiety, physically sick, the chills and that general sense of the lighting looking different because I ran out of my drug eighteen hours ago and have been getting strung along since. 


&nbsp;


Now, when I get strung along by a connect for subs I usually still have a few days of of medication and have been able to ration it further to make it last longer with great ease. As far as I'm concerned right now, even when I feel mopey - **la vita es bella.** 


&nbsp;



The flow has not ended, but further reflection and detail on things like the monthy 4am bike ride to the ATM shall be relegated to future post.

&nbsp;

#tl;dr: 

Saw Derrick the middle biking back from the ATM on Cliff's behest while I was on my way home from studying and gardening and watching TV sci-fi. It reminded me of how good life is now in comparison to a couple of months ago when it was hard to resist the opportunity to bike to the ATM for Cliff's fat ass in order to earn 20% of a single bundle in addition to buying myself some dope if I had the money. Cliff used to also sometimes extend me credit if I was broke but never 50% of the order as he used to expect from me. Doesn't matter now, just feels good to reflect on it instead of actively dealing with it.

I just need confirmation or to catch him in the act. He takes a shower before & after work! This is causing me so much stress, I want to use. And now I‚Äôm far from my family, so I‚Äôm basically alone. Maybe count all the subs & see if he‚Äôs actually taking them?? I just need to know. And to wait until we move to do this?? After a baby?? He claims I‚Äôm paranoid, but I really don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs driving me insane.

EDIT:We just used our life savings to buy a house down here. No mortgage, we spent 145,000 & are fixing it up. But its all in my name. Everything, his truck, my car, the house. The ONLY thing that isn‚Äôt is his motorcycle. But I‚Äôm not a bitch. I won‚Äôt take it all even though I easily could. I just want him to stop & get help, but he won‚Äôt admit it. He‚Äôs freaking 50 years old. This is his ONLY child. But thats how addiction works. He‚Äôs gonna die at this point. I cry as I sit here typing this. And he knows theres no where for me to run to(aka my parents) since were so far. I texted him 20 mins ago telling him we HAVE to have a talk after the baby goes to bed. No response still.

Edit: I‚Äôd like to thank (almost) everyone on this sub. Everyone gave great advice & no one judged. I still have yet to confront him(I hate confrontation) but I‚Äôm like 99% sure. ",1533150853.0

Is this a common thing?,"Ok a couple weeks ago I met someone who told me she has a sugar daddy that spends rediculous amounts of money on her, pretty much everyday. 

This lady is probably in her late 40s, and is missing damn near every tooth.  She smokes hella crack and then goes to town on herself picking at her skin with a pair of tweezers.  To sum it up, she is no model and has alot of wear on her from the lifestyle.  

So as I get to work with her more, she tells me all kinds of things about her sugar daddy.  (She seems very proud of it)
-The guy is in his mid 80s, and can barely walk.
They have never had sex together and are not romantic
He leaves hours away and the only conversations they seem to have are this lady screaming demands into the phone at her man.

Ok so I hear from her that, family members of the man have been contacting this lady asking her to find someone else to cling onto. Her response, ""those bitches just want his money when he dies, but they aint gettin it""
-I guess she has got over $450,000!! In less than 2 years from this guy, and hearing that made me almost puke.  She made a off hand statement that she has depleted his entire retirement fund.

So to me this situation is pretty fucked up and sick.  This crack head old witch of a lady is draining some old mans retirement fund.  His family needs to get a power of attorney and get his banks to not allow the transactions.

This was my first exposure to the sugar daddy world.  Tho it seems way common around my area, just talking with female users in the last couple of weeks.  Alot have said this was one of the main ways they or people they know supported themselves.  Whats up with this? As a guy I sure as shit wouldnt be cool handing my money off like that.  What have you people seen of the sugar daddy or sugar mommy(does that even exist) world? What do you feel about this as a hustle option?

Unfortunately it then turned more into a psychedelic, can't escape your demons, pull out all your deepest issues and stab them in your eyes type thing. The first experience, I took my very last bit of H(probably around 20mg) first thing in the morning when I woke up. I had used 200mg the days and months before all intranasal. About 3 hours after that dose I started to feel the minor WD come on so I started popping 300mg gabas one at a time. I knew about spacing them apart an hour-2 to maximize absorption. About 6 hours and 900mg gabapentin later I'm feeling pretty damn alright... Great actually. Music's enhanced, really getting into TV shows. Also just walking around messing with/observing objects in my home and completing mundain tasks became extremely interesting, just as a lot of dissociative drugs make things look sort of new in a way. It was a great high I must say. But best of all no signs of WD whatsoever... Not even cravings. Around midnight or so I don't even remember past this point I popped like a half a Xanax. Next thing I know it's about 10 hours later and I'm waking up like sleeping beauty. That's the first thing that popped in my mind is God damn I slept well and I feel beautiful right now. I continued to have a fantastic after glow the entire day. Easiest day of running dry I every experienced..  

Now the next time, I did pretty much everything the same. Mind you I had started IV not too long ago which may have had a major impact. My dose increased from 200mg a day intranasal to about 200-300mg IV. I dosed the tiny bit of my stash around the same time, started popping gabas and about 4-5 hours in I get EXTREMELY.. extremely emotional. I'm sitting for what felt like hours washing cottons like 3-4 times each trying to get a fix but getting nothing. I broke down crying on the floor looking at the needle in my arm. I continued to cry countless times that night. It seemed as if I had been instantly smacked in the face with all of the demons that this comfy warm heroin blanket had been covering up. The experience was very psychedelic and dissociative in a sense that's hard to describe. I've tried many many many classes of drugs and none of those experiences ever came close this gabapentin one. Maybe DXM or MXE In terms of the general dissociation from body and mind.  But gabapentin is incredibly unique and I'd say it's very set and setting dependant. I'd describe my first experience as sort of a euphoric dissociative benzo if that makes sense. What I'd image GHB to be like(one of the few substances I haven't tried). I didn't have any trouble running dry or withdrawing whatsoever. I woke up the next day feeling like a new man. But something about the second experience changed everything very dramatically. The only thing that calmed my emotions for a bit was to take a hike and listen to music. It was very entertaining to stare at the trees, mountains, ground and general landscape very much as if I was on LSD. Same sort of very indrigued headspace as well. But after I got back home I was right back to balling my eyes out. No physical withdrawal symptoms but heavy heavy emotional issues. Didn't sleep nearly as good that night either.  

I'm am still very interested in Gabapentin and potentially Lyrica and hope to try it again. Hopefully not in opiate WD this time although I was blown away by the effectiveness the first time around. All I have to say is gabapentin is certainly one of the most interesting substances I've tried. I was expecting it to be a mild benzodiazapine, I was pretty fuckin far off.",1533126916.0

Prescribed suboxone 18 years ago. It finally started to cause severe health problems. Wanted off subs so badly. Found out about Kratom, got off subs successfully for 9 months using Kratom daily then tapered off Kratom. I was doing great!  Felt wonderful. Then for some reason my hemoglobin dropped to 6.2. Had several blood transfusions. Had zero energy, hard to breathe. Still undergoing tests to find out what‚Äôs causing internal bleeding that‚Äôs causing the anemia. 
I gained 50 pounds in less than a month. Literally felt like I was on my death bed. My family doc gave me 10 vicodins to help with the pain. They definitely helped my pain. I felt good enough to cook dinner for family that night.  Tried to get more Vic‚Äôs till my endoscopy was scheduled. Doc said sorry, no more. Things went down hill quick again. Started asking around for a few Vic‚Äôs. No one had any. BUT an old friend told me to try some heroin. No way was I going to inject. I just wanted a little pain relief. I snorted a very small amount. My ‚Äúfriend‚Äù assured me I had no danger of od‚Äôing if I only snorted it. I used approximately 1 gram in a week. with no major problem. 
I knew right away this H was different. It was a different color. I did the same amount I‚Äôd been doing and immediately got extreme chills. My faithful, unsuspecting husband said I was burning up. Told him I was getting the flu and going to lay down. He went out to mow grass. I had about a 1/2 gram left that I‚Äôd tucked under my bra.  
This is last thing I remember was getting in bed at 4:00 pm.  Then hearing my named screamed over and over by strangers and feeling like my entire body was being pulled downwards and felt like I was just supposed to keep going with whoever was pulling me down. But the people pulling me upwards knew my name and kept telling me to come back and stay with them. My family needed  me. They knew my grandkids names. But the terrifying imaginary creatures pulling me down kept calling me by the wrong name. Going with the people who knew my real name seemed like a better idea, even though slipping downwards felt so blissful.  Until the creatures were getting really upset and started yanking me. I just kept fighting. Finally heard the good guys say‚ÄùWe have her back. She‚Äôs breathing‚Äù
Then I started talking and puking and truly felt like I was dying but I was breathing and alive. 
Got to the ER and never forget my poor husband standing in front of me telling the emt, Er personnel and cops I don‚Äôt do Heroin. Just prescribed a few Vicodin. At that precise moment the nurse pulls my bra up and out falls the little baggie. 
The look on his face will haunt me forever.  At that point they gave me more narcan. Oh dear God.  Ok I deserve this punishment but pleeeease, let this be over soon. 
My daughters were in the waiting room. I was too mortified to see them. That upset them even more. I knew at that point I was a total piece of shit, because the nurse in the ER told me my family wouldn‚Äôt want to ever see me and husband would probaly be filing for divorce. After 29 years of marriage I believed her. I was definitely in my right mind,  now wasn‚Äôt I?
This same nurse hit me with narcan a 3 rd time till, someone convinced ai didn‚Äôt need anymore. Thank you dear sweet someone. Everyone who had anything to do with saving my life Saturday night were amazing and extremely caring. Except this one nurse immediately disliked me the minute I was wheeled into ER. 
They kept me in ICU till mon because my hemaglobin had dropped to 6.4 and had to get 2 units of blood again,My feet and legs and hands swelled like bouncy houses. Did a colonoscopy and another endoscopy which all came out clear. So now I go for a capsule endoscopy. I pray they figure out the cause for the internal bleeding. I just want my life back and the ability to run around with my grandkids again. I learned not to fuck around with Heroin, no matter how small amount and snorting it can cause one to overdose. 
My husband and daughters are just relieved I‚Äôm ok and I‚Äôm back home and feel so fortunate my husband came in early from mowing grass to get a drink of water and found me non responsive. He gave me cpr and mtm I‚Äôm told and called 911. He thought I was already dead. 
I honestly didn‚Äôt care for the Heroin, but it was all I could find and it definitely helped

I‚Äôm not that dumb. But then she starts going through my reddit posts and every post I have made is in this sub. That‚Äôs when it pissed me off. I don‚Äôt have a single friend in real life that I can talk to about my addiction. She tries to understand but she has never lived it. When I found this sub, I finally felt at home to be myself and say what I feel. The first post she read, she tried to take the info and use it against me. I took my phone back because I NEED one place on this planet where I can speak freely and not worry about what she has to think. Taking my phone away set her off. I went out to smoke a cigarette and she locked me out in my pajamas with nothing but a lighter. Luckily I work down the street and my coworker lives 3 houses down. So I borrowed his work keys and I am now sitting in my work truck, withdrawing and waiting for my dboy that owes me 3 grams to finally hit me back. I didn‚Äôt see this fight coming, but I don‚Äôt think I am wrong. My addiction is wrong but I am human and need somewhere to belong.

When I found out my cancer was stage 3, I didn't know how to process it. Id fought so hard, was it all for nothing? I became rather self destructive for a bit. I od'd on fent one night when all I wanted was some pain relief and couldn't find any. Since then I have been struggling mentally in ways I can't even adequately put into words. Now I am at my best friends (my bf is out of town for work), and he is going to take me tomorrow to reach out for the mental help I need. The point of this post is to tell all of you that I see taking life so much for granted that it's easy to feel like you could take or lose your life and it wouldn't matter, that you just may feel differently if the choice to live or die was taken away from you. I've been that suicidal person. I've been that person who thought I didn't care if I lived or died. Now I am that person being told that the choice is no longer mine. The reality is that cancer will probably take my life. I've seen the look in the eyes of the people I love as they struggle to accept what is happening to me. I've heard how my bf cried and begged for my life as he saved me when i od'd. I'm now the person who understands that our life has value. YOUR life has value. I hope that you never have the choice completely taken away from you whether you live or die. Much love to each and every single one of you. You matter to me. ‚ù§",1533095996.0

I hate these four things, in the order of 4 least bad, 1 the worst:  
4) Can't keep my eyes open  
This is the least of the four problems I face (no pun intended.)  
I usually just lay on my bed and listen to music, noddin away, but when I go to reddit or some shit like that, it's annoyin the hell out of me.  
3) Can't shit  
This is not really a problem, but when you do go and take a shit, my anus damn near rips open.  
 2) The Itch  
Eyes, back, nuts; no matter the place, the itch is so fucked if you get it. My eyes and skin are red from the scratchin and itchin every time.  
And it lasts a long time when it happens, too.  
1, pt.1) Can't piss  
This is by far the worst shit ever.  
Drink a lil water or anything else, and when u gotta piss, u can't.  
You gotta sit and piss for lke 20mins at a time to empty the bladder.  
And finally, 1, pt 2) Double vision + eyes shut and open 20 times a minute  
I don't know about you, but if you are on reddit and try to type with your vision fucked and eyes shuttin an closin all the time, it takes you forever to do that.

I have had good blood, where I have been super steady handed and I also keep checking through the whole hit, push a few CC's,pull back, push a few more, pull back, and I'll be getting blood the whole way down, still I'll get a bubble under my skin and throughout the whole area.

I cold copped recently from the same block Ive been going to, but from a different dude. The boy Ive been getting has been a brown powder in the typical east coast stamp bags, just like all the dope I had done before this relapse. But this time he wasnt on the block, so I bought from another dude, who (aside from ripping me off a bit but hey, price to play) gave me a bag in a white stamp with decidedly different substance. When I poured it out, it was clumpier (?), and needed to be chopped significantly more. Also its a pure white color, like white-as-snow white. Initially I kinda panicked, thinking he had REALLY ripped me off and since I copped it back on friday night and have to wait every week until tuesday-friday to get high (long and shamrful story). But then I considered the idea that it might just be fentanyl. Ive never used fentanyl, aside from whatever fent has been in the bags Ive been using already, so I really dont know what it looks like powdered. I had a lollipop once but that was it. Like I imagine the dope I had been getting has just been real heroin cut with fent, and maybe this bag is just fent cut with another white substance? Does any more experienced user know what it could be? I overdosed once off of a hot bag and there have been literally hundreds of OD's in my city in the past couple weeks, so Im kinda wary. But also desperately would like to not get ripped off and be able to enjoy my few noddable days. I apologize for my inexperience, although things got serious for me quick I still havent been too long in the dope world.

Help would be greatly appreciated, love you all and stay safe out there!

[UPDATE] Ive been looking forward to tonight for so long, so I decided bump some in a realtively safe way, just in case. I split one bag into 8 teeny-tiny lines, and hit my first one. Let me just say: I was FUCKED UP but it startrd o fade just a little bit later. So I redosed again to keep it up, and Im halfway through the bag. I ready info on fentanyl highs, and this seems kinda typical of fetty. Is it safe to assume this is Fentanyl or at least another fentylouge? And how can I maximize its effectiveness while also staying safe? I insufflate, never tried to boof or IV before.",1533092247.0
