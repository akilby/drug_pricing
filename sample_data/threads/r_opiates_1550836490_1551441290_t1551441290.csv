So the pills I tried this on are 12.8mg codine to 300mg ibeprofen. The steps I follow were:

1. Left the pills whole and gently stirred them Into room temperature water

2. Poured through a coffee filter into a second cup

Obviously typical opiate tolerance will play apart but aside from that one of my friends with (for now) a near non-existent opiate tolerance will snort for example 1/8 of a sub the first day, the next day when he’s coming down he’d do a 1/4 and feel it the same but stopping for a week or so “resets” it. He also says that once you “get to a certain level” you don’t get much higher at all and I feel that’s my experience as well

Others say tolerance doesn’t go up much unless you’re doing it for an extended period and raising your doses 

Any thoughts or comments or general knowledge on the topic? I wanna get the most out of subs in the future lol

Love, pained killers love ❤️ 

Also (others online experience this as well but I’ve yet to meet someone irl that relates) suboxone is the most “stimulating” of the opioids or whatevs to me, all opiates  are stimulating in their own way for me more so Han others (my first time doing heroin I didn’t quite do enough, was still pretty dang high tho in comparison to other opiates, and I was kinda edgy at certain points even drank some wine to take the edge off lol)

So does anyone else get stimulating effects from opiates and specifically suboxone? Lol I literally stayed up around 36 hours last time I did em Bc of the minor stim effects, also does anyone know why it’s more stimulating? I know it works differently in the brain but dunno specifics

It was Day 6 off fent a dope (or whatever is going around like hot cakes in my area) 

I went to the hospital last thursday to stay just long enough to induce subs. I was there like 36 hours total... anyways, i did my lost shot of dope in my car right before they called me back in the ER, had one prepped so when they called me back i slipped out to my car to grab ""my things"" and did a big ole shot and walked back to check in to ER. 

They gave me a pee test to see what all was in my system, and all i failed for was cannabis. I had taken pharmaceutical Xanax (from my friends script, as well as roxicodone and norcos late sunday, and thursday evening was when i admitted myself).

I wasnt shocked that those pharmaceuticals didnt show up because i do clear out rather quickly, but the shot of powder i was doing all week did not provide a positive for opiates. This is pretty scary because i know a lot of people who buy from this guy/girl daily, and have seen 2 people go blue doing this dope. There are even times he/she wont sell to any one because the ""testers"" said it was too strong and fell out testing, and he has to cut it more.

Well i did 16mg of bupe on day 1
Day 2 i jumped all the way down to 1, 1mg - 2mg dose. I took xanax the following day and made it 48 hours before taking another 1, 1mg dose. I did the same thing for the next 48 hours.

Now, my dumbass was dumb enough to to leave a good chunk of a bag at home before the hospital, and its been sitting here next to my supply of M30s. So i woke up today extremely depressed and decided to do a shot after 6 days off and going 48 hours on a very low dose of sub. 

I got the rush that all junkies desire, pupils pinned, and the small withdrawal symptoms (runny nose, achy legs, low back pain, depression) all disappeared. Catching even slight nod 30 minutes later. Did a pretty small shot. 
Less than (.03)

I know im an idiot for todays experiment, feel free to tell me how dumb i am for using. But what could the plug possibly be sending out to every one that isnt showing up on a UA?? 

How can i find out what this stuff actually is? A lot of people are using it. Been with this plug for 4months, never had problems with product or anything like that. Aside from track marks, i look really healthy. A lot people like this stuff because it feels really clean, but what do we know?? Just trying to figure out what is being passed around on the streets, the people i know have no plan of coming off and have all told me they got the same ""good"" shit since i last copped a week ago.

Any insight appreciated. Again i know it was dumb using again, wont hurt my feelings if you tell me so.

what kind of jobs do yall work ?

I have been looking for a job lately and I know “money is money, no pain no gain” but being in chronic pain, especially back pain, anything labor intensive is not an option. I literally cant feel my back if I stand for more than 10 minutes. it goes numb and feels like a knife is stuck in my back, while its also numb if that makes sense. so what jobs can yall do while also not putting yourself thru more unbearable pain than you can already handle ? 

also: how do you work around having to use / take during work ? when I did work, I would take my meds during my break and sit and wait for everything to take effect before I even got up. am I the only one who feels theyre wasted or dont work as well if you dont wait til they take effect to do anything other than sitting / laying down ?

On a fentanyl high atm by smoking fent-mix on foil. I am thinking aka just also my fantasy/my imagination is going now :

............................................................................................................................

What if there was a compound/analoge of something or etc that was invented that when you take it it fixes your receptors and dopamine in your brain. Something an opi addicted person takes before going to sleep and then have ton put earbuds in and let an audio file play while you sleep. The audiofile is just sound or a voice or pfff, just let your imagination work on this very moment when you read this.

&#x200B;

Then when you wake up everything in your brain and body is fixed and it's again to the state from before you ever took the first opiate in your life OR even better any sort of drugs including cigs,coffee,etc.. No wd's and you feel great + thanks to that audiofile you DONT EVEN KNOW HOW AN OPIATE FEELS SO YOU CANT MISS IT OR CRAVE IT.

&#x200B;

Audiofile would be like a sort of hypno type thing shit. But the 1 thing you will know and remember is that you once were an opi or any sort of form addict. THAT you will remeber and know it's bad but you can't remember the feel of the high or the taste or the smell so you don't miss it. So when you have an operation or accident and have to take a painkiller so only as a last RESORT...and you are healed and dont need the painkiller(s) again after days or weeks you just repeat the procces with taking it so you are again fixed (opi receptors in the brain).

&#x200B;

I am just a little bored and high so just a little rant and my imagination i have atm. This i want to share lol. I know i haven't thought this thru and there will be many negatives. Just something i was and am now thinking about.

&#x200B;

Happy nods !!

I don’t know the guy well but I know he uses (I’ve heard him mention percocets before but it’s likely he uses others). He was acting worse than normal this morning. We’re couriers for a startup and I went out for my first batch of tasks for the morning. When I came back an hour and a half later he was passed out like in the picture. 

He’s breathing and I’m keeping an eye on him but he’s in the lounge so anyone who passes by can see him. The office is still pretty empty but I’d like to help him out before he gets fired or something. 

Any idea on how I can help him out so I can grab him a super strong coffee and actually get him working before he gets in a shitty situation?

Mind, I got a skin condition called neurodermatitis which causes itchy skin patches. Basically I was wondering if taking opioids in this situation would bring a relief to it, make it even worse as I heard of them causing an itching sensation or if it would just not interfere at all.

So I did some reading on the Opioid Induced Itch also called [Pruritus](https://www.opiates.com/opioid-induced-itch-pruritus/). The itching “under the skin” is said to mimic similar environmental allergic reactions as opiate drugs release histamine triggering the body's inflammatory response. This didn't give me an answer to my initial question, but got me thinking about the correlation to preexisting allergies. 

As allergies are also caused by histamine release, it seems intuitive that opioids make an allergy worse by releasing even more histamine in the body. But, upon a [bluelight thread](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-639968.html) I found, they can do the opposite and reduce allergy symptoms, e.g. clear up runny noses. I believe this is rather due to masking the symptoms and other effects, but one user also said they had horrible allergies that only got better after they stopped the drugs.

It basically got me wondering about some scenarios and the effect of opiate or opioid consumption in these cases.

1. How would or could opioids influence preexisting itchy skin patches?
2. How would or could opioids influence a preexisting allergy? Also not limited to like hay fever but also food allergies etc.
3. Would the allergy get better or worse after being on opioids for a long time and then stopping them?

I'm interested in your experiences and thoughts on these issues! Allergies are so common, I bet some of you guys have experience here. I'm curious.

*Disclaimer: I still can't really figure where to say opiates and where opioids, so please don't get mad if I mixed them up. What I read, opiates refers to natural (opium-) substances and opioids to semi-/synthetic ones, but I'm interested in the reaction to both.*

*Also: I kinda try to stay away from opiates/opioids (for reasons), so no, I couldn't figure the answer buy just self-experimenting.*",1551366876.0

These phones will look sort of normal, but will fold out into android tablets. Current info places the screen sizes between 7 and 8 inches. When folded, the screens will be like 5 -6"".

Samsung and Huawei have phones coming out right now, but Motorola, and several unnamed chinese companies will also have folding phones soon.

Initial pricing looks like around 2000 per phone. I know damn well you guys are not going to use your hard earned or stolen dope money for these guys, but eventually the price will drop.

Your regular new android phones for 2019 will be bigger, faster, smarter and have more memory. They will also cost more but, don't worry, you can get ripped off by the major phone companies for as little as 25.00 per month.

As an aside, a few years ago it was almost impossible to find a cell phone that cost more than 500.00. 

Now 1000 is not that uncommon. Are they just that much better?

No. They are not.

I can have it sent at my workplace but wtf. I am not sure if I should just carry on with my shit life and die in silence from the pain or get it again and doing it on the hide.

I've gotten myself a great doctor, been seeing them for about a year now after 4 years of buying my subs myself from local connects.

**Current situation:** 

&#x200B;

I'm prescribed 2 8mg strips a day. I generally dont take anything til i'm getting up and moving for the day , or as i'm about to walk into work, etc.

When i first get my script filled I will find myself taking 3-4 throughout my day. They actually do make me feel better and more motivated getting through the busy night shift . 

I usually run out about half way through my monthly and have to buy what i need til i get to my next appointment which is just frustrating, and I know each time that i did it to myself.      ~~i'm a piece of shit~~

I really need to find a regimen and stick to it., I've thought of only taking one with me to work, i recently cut a day from my shift that links up with the one day off a week i get to give my self a 2 day break and let some of the sub run out of my system a bit. 

I also tried to set up my appointments to the ""every two weeks""  and that got me pushed to monthly appointments which screwed me even further. 

I'm worried that if I speak to my Dr. or my therapist that they will kick me out for abusing my prescription and that would really screw me right now. 

anyway thanks for reading and if you have any advice i'd really love the input ! 

**<3**

**TL;DR I basically abuse my suboxone script and i'm looking for ways to help control my usage before I get caught up with no meds or less than i should have. thanks:)**

It's been several years since I've used any opiates.

I just listened to a song that seemed to describe my relationship with opiates really well. And despite the fact that several loved ones of mine have died because of heroin, my first reaction was to want to use heroin.

I remember, years ago, hearing people say that chipping long term just isn't possible. And they're right - there's a reason I stopped, and it's because I started trying to rationalize using on Wednesdays plus weekends to use more but still avoid physical dependence. I recognized that that was addict thinking.

But when I think of heroin the thing I think about is the first time, that feeling of a warm security blanket and heroin telling me I'm safe. It makes me sad that I'll never feel that again, that feeling of perfection never comes back once it's gone.",1551328124.0

Have you ever noticed how people drive with their windows closed, even when it is 70 degrees? That is so weird.

I had an interesting experience today. I had to go to a dentist.

He fixes my tooth and tells me to take some advil, which I am fine with. Then he gives me a script for vicodin.

I tell him thanks, but I do not take opiates.

And he says, well, they are pain pills. If you are in pain, you may need them.

I say, thanks again, but it would be a waste.

That is that, but as I am driving away, I start thinking.

If you are in pain, you need pain meds.

And I am remembering the countless times I self medicated with iv heroin. I guess I was in pain. So I start wondering exactly what my pain was. Trying to pin it down exactly. Not a generalized, I didn’t feel right kind of deal.

In my case, I think it involved feeling different. From the time I was a little kid, if I didn’t know you, I saw you as a potential threat. Even if I did know you, I kept an eye on you.

To me, people were unpredictable. I would say the wrong thing and suddenly I was not cool. Oops.

As I got older, I learned how to better handle people, but I never really understood how to be social. I was still a bit hyper alert, and watched people closely to make sure I didn’t say or do anything that freaked them out.

This was exhausting. 

I suppose this must have been painful, because the minute I was exposed to heroin, I was all over it. It felt great and it insulated me from my own inability to connect.

I was cool.

Years later, I somehow figured out that heroin was like a magic trick. It sort of looked like real life, but you could tell something shifty was going on.

Heroin was a permanent barrier between me and the people that I wanted to love. I simply could not feel them while I was high.

I was out of tune. Like a human guitar. I was on a different frequency. The wrong harmonic.

This was ok when I was a kid, but eventually it got kind of bleak.

At some point, I wanted to hang out with regular humans. The internet was just not enough. My junkie friends were not enough. Life just kept rolling by.

Whatever happiness was, I definitely did not have it.

Just as bad, I was literally chained up to the dope and I could do nothing without making the required arrangements.

This all really sucked, once I thought about it. It became intolerable.

But looking at it now, I understand the truth of what this dentist said to me. Pain meds for pain. It doesn’t get any more simple than that.",1551321975.0

I get an automated call saying my appointment is the the 1st.  Im 100% sure its the 28th. We dont forget our refill days...

I call and tell them that and say theres a discrepancy in the schedule and he will speak to the doctor to fill it today or tomorrow. No one calls back. I call 15 min before the office closes and they tell me everyone is gone.  Tomorrow is fine. Its day 30. So it wouldnt be early nor am i trying to cheat to get it early. I will be out of meds tomorrow. 

I told him i wont be able to come in on the 1st. I wont be able to get out of bed. 

I left a nice long message from there website explainijg there mistake and hopefully hear from them tomorrow morning. 

My doc has sent it in before with out seeing me since i had surgery and was un able to get to her.

Before you ask. The script is for 120. 15mg oxy hcl.

The idea of me getting it tomorrow per my orginal appointment was making me happy.

I dont abuse them. Just the anxiousness of being out and getting sick has made my stomach in nots.

Since this is clearly an administrative mistake they should take care of it right? I told them if i had the meds id still come in on the 1st for there documentation of me being there.


Edit: So i just spoke to the same man I spoke to yesterday, and he was very apologetic and kind of even started crying. He told me he saw my record and i never missed an appointment, never late, always nice. So there wouldnt be a problem.  He says the doc should have no issue filling it as long as I promise ill be there tomorrow for documentation the doc saw me since its a c2 medication. ( been going there over a year) 

Edit #2 : Not sure if you get a notification if i edit this but anywho. I spoke to the same man. My doc is in another office on an emergency from another doc calling out. He said he will contact her and she should fill it. Just waiting on the notification from CVS or a call back saying she sent it in. Thanks to all who commented. Ill update again once I get the script to let you all know I am fine. 


Edit #3. Doc called it in. Just picked up my script. Anxiety is no more. Andbpain free.

I don't know if that's true. But it has nothing to do with this post, either way.","  

By the time I get to the motel, the parking lot is full of junkies waiting for me to open for business. The sun is not over the skyline, yet. And breath looks like hot smoke in the cold. Their lunatic eyes flicker pale death. The black and harrowed faces of the horde watch me, these unholy congregants staring silent and hostile. It’s almost like I’m some stranger come upon a tribe of savages in the urban wilderness or even their own high priest cursed with disease or something like that. You know? So, I walk to my door. They make way, parting like that fabled body of water and wait for me to invite them in.

“Three at a time.” I say pointing. “You. You. And you first. After that, three at a time.”

My business is no secret. Not that I can say it ever was, but now, anyone with half a lick of sense can see that whoever is renting out room 127 sells dope. Sells something anyway. It makes me uneasy. There’s so much to be paranoid about.

“What you need?” I ask the first guy. 

He opens his mouth. His breath is hot and stinks. “Got 210 bucks here, boss. What you got?”

“I’ll give you a ball.” 

That's probably a little high. But, my prices fluctuate with the way I'm feeling about whoever is buying. Besides, he doesn't seem to care. Probably because he knows that the reputation the dope has will get him his money back fast. And then some. I weigh it out. Put it in a bag. He flashes a grim toothed grin and rubs his hands on his jeans. He wears a hood. He looks like a cartoon witch and steps back out into the parking lot. It goes on like that for an hour. Non-stop sales. A gram. Another eighth. Whatever 17 bucks will get. Of course, Eddy and Peanut Boy and the rest of the regulars show up. And once noon comes around, I put my bag on my back and walk back towards the bus stop. 

Now, I can’t say it’s the first time that I am seeing a green Ford Taurus with dark tinted windows across the street. Because, I know it’s not the first time I’ve seen it. But it is the first time that I notice that I have seen it before. And that, very likely, it’s the law. It’s surveillance. But I know they won’t make their move, now, so I keep walking and do my best to forget about them until I have to deal with it.  ",1551311991.0

 I have been on 80mg/day, well, I was truly a speedball addict, all my shots for the final 2 yrs had coke.

I had an OD, and all my family discovered, sad been the junkie of the family, I got a ride to hospital and them they fucked me givin 10mg 4x/day ORALLY, so obviously the wds starts, been on hell, they tappered 800mg/day IV, with 40mg to 10mg and then put me on methadone, 10mg got to 60mg. Why they dont just detoxed morph, I was having hard wds anyway, that dose is ridicuously. 

My psichyatrist after that put me on 100mg of methadone/day, oh, I was a benzo abuser too, tappering  now with 5mg of kpins/day (didnt botthered me because in rehab they are giving me kpins).

In rehab I was tooking daily:
- 5mg kpins
- 20mg lexapro
- 450mg pregabalin
- 100mg dones 
- 300mg seroquel

Seroquel makes me sleepy all day, I hate quetiapine.

After rehab I cut off seroquel, and stop taking, my psichy put me on trazadone 50mg/day for sleep, didnt do much for me. I have no money after, loose my job, and was living with my mom, but I relapsed on coke, and crack trying a coke IV rush, but it is nothing compared. 3 days binge, I am supervised closed now because mom got me snorting coke with a rock behind. Fuck, they think I was using for months, but it was a relapse, I am supervised 24/7 today, it sucks too.

Too explain everything, I am a borderline, I cut myself often, border type depressive one, to explain my meds, today I am on psych, and psicoterapy trying to have some reason to live.

Lost my girl, and my family, I am really depressed, got one more med, 300mg bupropion/day.

Basically we have glial cells that sort of insulate the cells of our nervous system. It seems they also have receptors, kind of like the opiate receptors we have all heard of, except they are for the immune system. They help recognize foreign stuff in your body and get antibodies and such to attack.

It turns out that these inflammation receptors play a part in opiate dependence.

I had never heard of this before. All I knew was about the mu opioid receptors and how dopamine plays a part in drug craving and possibly paws.

Apparently that is not the whole story and more will be revealed. Here is the relevant info from r/drugnerds, contributed by

[https://www.reddit.com/user/selfless\_self](https://www.reddit.com/user/selfless_self)

The studies suggest *in addition to*  the role played by μ-opioid receptor, TLR4 mediated inflammation is  also implicated in dependence and withdrawal, borne out by animal  studies. Ibudilast might not be a good drug to mitigate withdrawal since  it's broad spectrum but TLR4 specific drugs may also not work well  since other receptors like TLR2 might be involved. See the excerpts from  three studies below.

>Drugs  such as ibudilast and propentofylline have both neuronal and glial  effects, and it is clear that they have multiple effects. This suggests  that (+)-naloxone analogs should be considered that specifically target  TLR4 rather than having broad effects as do propentofylline and  ibudilast. (10.1016/j.tips.2009.08.002)  
>  
>Interestingly,  morphine reward and dependence/withdrawal may differ regarding TLR4  involvement. Despite broad-spectrum glial attenuators reducing  proinflammation-linked opioid dependence/withdrawal (Hutchinson et al.,  2008a; Hutchinson et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011), **TLR4 −/− mice are not protected against opioid withdrawal, suggestive of a TLR4-independent mechanism** (Liu et al., 2011). (10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0684-12.2012)  
>  
>Based  on findings from a previous study that blocking TLR4 receptor by  (+)-naloxone attenuated precipitated withdrawal in rats (Hutchinson et  al., 2010), we would expect that knockout TLR4 and MyD88 would protect  mice from withdrawal. However, this was not the case, as both TLR4 KO  and MyD88 KO mice displayed similar degrees of withdrawal behavior as  their wild-type equivalent Balb/c mice. This suggests that: **firstly,  there is no question that the μ-opioid receptor plays a critical role  in opioid dependence; secondly, in addition to TLR4, other neuroimmune  pathways are likely to contribute to opioid withdrawal.** One of  the possible candidates is the TLR2 pathway, as (+)-naloxone may block  both TLR4 and TLR2 receptors, and recent evidence suggests that morphine  can also mediate neuronal cell function through TLR2 (Li et al., 2010).

2) I went immediately from inpatient to a 90 day program which consisted of housing, a 30 day partial hospitalization program with daily group counseling and weekly individual counseling along with seeing a psychiatrist and addressing my mental health (anxiety and depression) and being prescribed proper medications (currently on wellbutrin, Zoloft, and mirtazapine for sleep) and daily AA/NA meetings... after this 30 day period the last 60 days were intensive out patient which consisted of group counseling 4 days a week, daily AA/NA meetings, and the freedom to get a job

3) after the 90 day program, I had a job, a network of people in AA/NA from attending meetings daily, a sponsor, and proper medications, so I went straight to a sober living house where we still have to go to meetings everyday and have a job to pay rent and supply ourown food... I plan on staying here somewhere between 6-12 months

I love my life so much now, and hope this can serve as a helpful aid for anyone seeking sobriety but clueless as to go about achieving that goal

Somehow I have managed to never exceed a 30mg/day (7.5ish mg per dose spread over the day and night) oxy habit for almost five years years and I can safely say my current addiction severity is exponentially worse than when I was on 30mg/day in 2015. A few factors have contributed to the anomaly of my habit, like a natural low tolerance, a lot of responsibilities, financial constraints, as well as maintaining goals, hobbies, relationships with family/friends, and hope for the future. Additionally, I actually don't find the euphoria in high doses that great as I really only feel good during the come up, as soon as I peak I just feel lethargic and look forward to coming down and resetting, so I am basically living for that 15 minute window of time. That window of time used to be many hours and I was guaranteed to have a great evening and night if I popped something as early as 4 or 5 PM, but, as the return to withdrawl has gotten faster over time, the window of euphoria has gotten smaller and smaller to the point of being a very small fraction of what it used to be.

 I have never experienced hardcore Heroin withdrawl, but the level of discomfort I am at from this mild amount of oxy is scary to me, especially when I wake up every morning in hell and can't do anything until my morning cocktail of oxy and caffeine or vyvanse depending on what I have, is in me. I can no longer get a good sleep as the withdrawl seems to wake me up earlier. So that's just what I wanted to share to maybe give a warning to people like me who thought if they didn't allow their tolerance to rise they would be able to keep the addiction at bay, sorry to say it doesn't work. Luckily I might have a real chance at getting off soon as after being broke for over a year I have spent the last 6 months building a business that I can run online from anywhere, so soon I may be able to afford to take off somewhere for a few weeks and slay the dragon.

[Long Post],"Hi everybody, I've been lurking this sub for yearsbas a general psychonaut with an appreciation for opiate culture. I haven't used anything since I used some percs, dills, morphine, and hydrocodone a couple of years ago but I recently acquired the drug I've always been most interested in: opium. I have since attempted to eat 120mg on one occasion, and smoked the same amount (out of a bong) after eating 50mg of diphenhydramine on another. Both were extremely underwhelming experienced and I am wondering how to achieve the best effects as not to waste my limited supply. Obviously a specialized pipe would be ideal, but after scouring local pawn, antique, and vintage shops, as well as the dark web I have had no luck in finding one for sale. Additionally - and I'm sure you'll all warn me in the kind manner this sub usually does - I am aware of the addictive properties of the substance and am not consuming it regularly. All suggestions are appreciated, thank you kindly in advance. 

TLDR: best ways to smoke opium?",1551291098.0

I was diagnosed with Sarcoidosis almost exactly a year ago and had terrible swelling and joint pain in ankles, knees, fingers, elbows, and wrists.  I was prescribed methotrexate, prednisone, and tramadol and from taking the tramadol for so long until I got my condition under control I became addicted to it. I have taken a range of 6-10 50 mg tablets of tramadol almost daily for almost a year now. I got it from alternative sources for the last 9-10 months. I managed to never take anything stronger during that time even though I had pretty easy access to it.

Things came to a head yesterday and I was confronted by by loved ones and absolutely have to stop cold turkey in order to keep my job and my family.  I rationalized my use as me needing it for my condition but fully understand and realize now I was/am addicted. I took 300 mgs about 26 hours ago and already feel absolutely terrible. Aches, sweats, chills, nausea, diarrhea, depression. 

What can I expect and how long should I expect all of this to go on as far as withdrawing? I am terrified that I almost lost my job and want more than anything to stop as I almost saw my world burn come crashing down before my eyes. 


Thank you in advance.

I’m one of those people that get them from him. I usually only buy X amount, and that’s it for the month. He will call me frequently after, telling me he found 3 of them in a drawer, and wanting to know if I want them because he needs money for bills or lottery tickets. I sometimes will say sure, but usually not. 

Anywho, I had been waiting for a couple days now, and he just went and picked them up. He doesn’t like people coming to his apt, so I asked him if he would be willing to drop them off at my house. The pharmacy is like maybe 5 min away, his house maybe 10. 

Last time he dropped them off I told him I would give him $10 for gas. That’s quite a bit for the distance he had to go but whatever. I appreciated him doing that for me. 

So two days ago when he asked if I wanted a drop off I said sure and I’ll give ya A LITTLE GAS MONEY. meaning $5. 

Anyways he gets here, I always pick up quite a few and they aren’t cheap at $1/mg. I told him there was the $$ plus $5 for gas. My god this dude flipped the fuck out. Screaming at me from his truck in my drive way. “You fucking told me $10!” No I didn’t I told you I would give you gas money. “Yeah and last time you gave me $10” so I tell him to stop fucking crying as I reached into my pocket for another $5 I was going to use for lunch. I toss it at him and he’s laughing “see I told you that you said $10” I just reply with “you enjoy raping me don’t you” as I took my stash and walked in my house.

The doctor gave me nothing for my pain. So since I got currently a very low tolerance to dope I snorted about .2 and popped over the course of 2 hours 8x10mg Valium (Diazepam) and half a bar. So thats 100mg of Diazepam if you calvulate the Xanax bar into Diazepam. Feeling much better but am still in pain. So I feel good and relaxed now but my pulse is 180 to 100 and thats very high. Could that come from the benzos and dope? Feeling good is necessary right now since I was detoxing 5 days without any comfort meds. Just received 1.5gs on monday and now I still got about .7-.9 left. Received 3 samples. 1 normal dope, 1 so called OD H which is super potent and rare dark heroin. Its all super fire dope and the benzos will help me now. I can go without anything for 12 hours and still dont feel any wds. And I want it to stay like this. I will receive tomorrow 5more gs of some fire dope. I got about 20 Diazepam left so I will just consume them rather than do dope so I wont get addicted again. Also I will get some more benzos. So I for sure wont have to go through wds again and if I have tonI will at least have some comfort meds. My only problem is that I will need a driver and currently only my mom can drive me. So I have to find an excuse to go to my drop to which I can walk. But I need to find a good excuse why I am leaving again. So this wont be easy but I can do it. Wish me luck. This post got no real meaning I am just a bit pissed off that the doctor dont gave me any pain meds. So I need to find a good excuse to get out of the house again tomorrow.

This is just great. Several companies are bringing out really big screen phones this year.  The cool factor is that these guys fold in half. So you have the best of both worlds. Regular size phones for walking around, or tablet size phones when you can sit down and do your reddit.

Samsung has been leaking press releases about this concept for years. I guess they finally pulled it off.

There is the Samsung Galaxy fold. It has a 4.6 inch screen or a 7.3” display in tablet form. It will cost just under 2000.00.

You have the Huawei Mate X, which is a 6.6” phone or an 8” tablet and will sell for about 1980.00.

Yes, you heard that right. About two grand for a fucking phone.

Both phones have latest super fast processors, too much memory that you do not need and awesome cameras to take even better selfies so you can show the world your enlarged pores. They will also have 5g advanced and faster internet so you can see websites even faster than the 2 seconds it takes now. Yawn.

I am not that excited over these phones. I would love to have a 7” display, but 2 grand?

Nah.

How is it that these devices cost 400% more than a regular decent android tablet?

But you are not taking into account R & D costs, realcat.

Sure. I know. Cause Samsung execs are sooo underpaid.

Eventually prices will drop and maybe I will be able to actually see text on my goddam mobile apps. Or, I could drop dead of a heart attack first. Either way,Samsung? 2 grand?

(Suboxone advice needed),"Hello opifam, I have a somewhat rare reason for needing a sub script. I have snowballed my street suboxone use into a  serious dependency both physical and mental. While normally I would be buying oxy, codeine, and hydros to get my fix here and there all my plugs now are incredibly pricey, dodgy, inconsistent and honestly seem like narcs sometimes. So over time I've been accepting subs as payment for my goods. It was only occasional at first but somehow it ended up being something I wanted instead of my everyday meds. So I've gotten to the point to where I've paid 35 per sub tablet many times. Sometimes if I'm sick I'll offer like 15 of my 30mg addys(usually 8+a pop) for ONE single sub. 

What I'm trying to convey is that i can't afford to spend all my money on subs that hardly last me a few days. Maybe I could have had I still had my old plug whod do them for 10 sometimes less(ended up robbing me for 200 in subs) but 35? Can't do it.

I want to ask your opinion because I cant live like this anymore. The insanely high prices, the constant blowing off or getting spun for days just to get my 40 dollar sub. It's just not worth it and I cqnt keep letting these scumbags take advantage of my desperation.

The only thing that is scaring me from trying to get a script is that 1. My mom and sister work at my GP office and they can see my ORS if they want. 2. I'm currently on Gabapentin and Adderall daily as prescribed and I'd be kinda devastated to lose either one of them. 
3. I'm on Medicaid and I'm very broke at the moment so I don't know if there's any place that can take my insurance for a visit and script. 

The final question is; Given those three possible hindrances to my process of getting stable and taking my life back, what would any of you do if you were me and needed a sub script asap in order to not be fucked and have to jump from 8+mg a day to nothing but CT? Any advice is welcomed and appreciated. I don't like to cry out for help but I have half a zubsolv left and after that I have nothing. The withdrawals I've gone through(all of em many times) don't even come close to the long agonizing withdrawal I keep going into with these subs. Thanks guys.

Morphine, and Oxycontin. The itching usually dissipates if i go to sleep, if i happen to not fall asleep the itching seems to persist until i finally sleep. In my worst case, I had taken an OP 60 at about 9pm with 2 benadryl, i started itching about 4-6 hours later, i re dosed another 2 benadryl which didn’t seem to help, i had stayed up until about 4pm the next day still itching until i fell asleep. The benadryl says to not exceed 6 pills in a 24hr period. Max i’ve taken was 6, 3 before my dose, and another 3 sometime during. I’ve got benadryl topical gel which does seem to help a little bit but I’d like to hear what you guys do

BUT you can catch a slight buzz, a sense of wellbeing above ""normal mood"" if dosed low enough. Personally i've done this with doses around 0.25-4mg/day, but i felt the ""ceiling""/antagonistic effects starting to take over at 2mg+/day for me.

&#x200B;

I want to share my experiences and i'm curious about what experiences YOU've had. Below i'll share what i've found out by searching and testing myself (testing still ongoing and everything medically related is very individual. So your optimal dose would also have to be tested out by yourself if you're interested.). I succeeded quite well with 0.5mg/day but i was too curious how bigger doses compare so currently i find myself above the ceiling effect. Been experimenting for about a year now with the last few months on way too high doses. First 6 months was quite successful with doses below 2mg/day.

&#x200B;

\- I read about someone who experienced maximum ""buzz"" at 0.5mg/day for daily use. This person claimed he had been using this dose successfully for \~6 months with steady effect. And using the drug for a total of \~2 years.

\- I read about another person who experienced his/her optimal dose to be 1mg/day after 10 years of experience & testing.

\- Personally i managed to get nice effects between 0.25-2mg (sometimes even 4mg, but that's way too much you're just pulling the roof/ceiling-effect on you). This worked well for about 6 months, then i started trying higher doses, i felt the raise from 2mg/day to 4mg/day giving me even more of a buzz, but the ceiling-effect also came closer eventually blocking the effect. Nowadays i'm routinely using big doses just to feel well. But soon enough i'll start tapering down again and find my own sweetspot. I believe it's somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5mg for me. Splitting 4mg into 2x2mg doses each day does sometime give me a slight buzz from one of the halves. I'm sure it has to do with the fluctuation in the blood levels and the pieces not being exactly 50/50 in size resulting in one of the giving a slight buzz for a couple hours.

\- Another option of course is to use a couple days, have a break for a couple of days and it'll always work.  


EDIT: Adding what type of ""buzz"" i'm talking about, what i've managed to feel longterm using low-doses buprenorphine. It's a slight buzz similar to 30-50mg codeine/50mg tramadol (w/o tolerance). It's not much, you barely feel it. But it sure is nice!",1551214762.0

So it’s been 30 minute each way trips down to the city, to scoop this tweaker and use him for his connects for the dope boys that hangout inside this big ass corner liquor store. (Sounds corny & cliche but this liquor store is actually sweet as fuck and I know the owner is cool and lets dudes trap out of it, so more power to em) 

Obviously, when this all started out it was gravy. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. I’m copping $70-$100 worth, I’ll throw him $10-$25 for some dimes or a couple stones or whatever his little heart may desire...

Over time though, the service from said middle man has declined. Steadily. More demanding, more begging, more excuses when my bags are looking short. I get it, he’s an addict too and this is what you sign up for when you go through a middle man. 

Dudes phone was shut off last week so he had to call the dope boy off of my phone and place the order that way :) 

For a whole week I’m pondering the idea of just contacting this dude on my own, completely going over the MM’s head, who in all reality is still a decent dude. 

So today was the day, after getting all my bills paid I had a nice chunk of change left to play around with and didn’t want it to go to waste, or go towards a shitty amount of dope that I’d be regretting buying 2 days later. So as I’m driving by the MM’s house, I say fuck it and call the dope boy myself. To my surprise, he’s super fucking cool about it! 

I couldn’t believe it at first, he definitely didn’t recognize my voice, and it threw him off to where I feel like he was ABOUT to hang up on me, but once I described who I normally show up with and what I drive (I’m at the spot 1-3 times weekly) he knew exactly who I was. 

Picked him up straight from his home, which we normally never do, whipped him to the corner store for a beer and a shot and got served right there in my car. Took him back to the house and we must have sat outside and bullshitted for a solid 15 minutes. Super fucking nice guy. Wasn’t even mad that I called him myself or anything. He even threw me a couple extra packs for spending what I spent today! Double score! 

So instead of blowing a lot of money and receiving half the worth of dope, on top of throwing the MM a finders fee, I’m just now arriving home with more dope than I’ve ever carried on me, for what I’m considering an awesome price :D 

All because I manned up and said fuck it.

Wether that’s JJ coming through or just plain fate, I’m thankful and hoping y’all have some good news to speak of yourselves! 

Stay safe y’all, much love. 

TL;DR: normally I get raped by my MM for plugging me, decided to call the plug myself and ended up getting hooked tf up, dude was super nice and chill. Score.

av2t2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/av2t2d/precipitated_withdrawal_experiences/,6,https://redd.it/av2t2d,tylsergic,Precipitated withdrawal experiences.,"I've tried again and again to look up experiences on this and I've always failed to find people describing the moment where every bit of the opiate is stripped from the receptor by Naloxone, buprenorphine, or any other antagonists/mixed agonist-antagonist. I'll share my experiences with using buprenorphine after morphine. If anybody else has any experiences they would like to share let me know.

I've had kidney stones, I've gone through multiple drug withdrawals at the same time, and I've been morbidly depressed for a majority of my life among other things. Nothing compares to the pain of PWs. Although it may be brief I'd rather detox for days than ever go though that bullshit again. 

The first time I experienced them I was using 300-600mg of morphine IV for 3 weeks. Well the morphine was running low but I had Suboxone. So I planned to transition like I had done a million times before. Before I had always snorted my sub in small doses way after in order to avoid PWs. I never had them as long as I waited at least 12-16 hours and used small amounts of sub at a time.

I had woken up after using about 300mgs+ of IV morphine the day before. All of the fresh shots done before 7 p.m. However I had the last week's worth of cottons that I had eaten at about 9 p.m which obviously had plenty of morphine left in them because it made me pass out around 11. I slept as long as I possibly could and ended up sleeping till 4 because the withdrawals were absolutely killing me. I was sweating, vertigo, chills, aches and pains, etc.

I felt so bad I just threw 2mg in a spoon drew it up and injected in my bathroom. I never felt anything from IV sub it would just kick in sooner. I was weirded out first by and intense smell of burning hair mixed with the orange. I will remember that God awful smell the rest of my life. Then I proceeded to feel intense vertigo and dizziness that made me want to sit down. As soon as I sat down I felt a rush that was everything an opiate rush wasn't. Pure hell. Goosebumps enveloped my skin and my hair was standing straight up. The most intense chills would start at the top of my spine and roll down to the bottom bringing my arms chills with it. It felt like I was sorrounded by ice. As soon as the chills went away I would get an intense hotflash that acted in the same way as the chills. Both would interchange between chills and hot flashes. As this is going on my arms and legs feel like are being ripped apart and flailing them is the only natural reaction I can do. My head has very painful pins and needles but instead of them feeling very little and all over the place I feel like hellraisor. They just stay in the same place going in and out. A fetal position is all I can muster while swaying back and forth. These were just the physical symptoms but the mental side was just as bad if not worse.

My anxieties were racing. I felt like I was on 1g of meth and a pot of coffee while going through benzo withdrawal. My first thought was will it go away or will there be irreparable damage. This faded as everything and everyone I saw on TV I hated with a passion. My self perspective was the worst. I hated my self and started thinking of every mistake or slightly embarrassing moment with complete shame and disgust. My mind started to cycle through all these moments. Every fraction of a second something would come up. It didn't matter what time it occurred. I actually felt shame because of embarrassing things that happened when I was 8 up until the age I was of 22. They would just pop up one after another every half second like your life flashing before your eyes. It was like a day of the worst withdrawals imaginable packed into 15 minutes. The 15 minutes feels like a 2 hours. When it was over I swear I would still feel like complete and utter shit for a full 24 hours. I normally don't get the best relief from sub for the first couple of days. After PWs I would get zero relief. Idk if it's possible that this reaction can damage the receptors or what but I would feel off for 1-2 days.

I had one more experience where I was adding crystal into an Adderall reshot that had units in them while having done morphine 3 hours before. I had forgotten there was also half of a 4mg Subutex shot in it. I felt the speed then complete disaster as all that started but the mental anguish was further exasperated by the amphetamines. Needless to say I spent 20 minutes crying in a fetal position.

I've learned my lesson after these couple of times and I'll only snort buprenorphine afterwards in tiny amounts with a lot of time in between. It feels like the most unnatural thing ever. Nobodies brain chemistry is ever supposed to be that messed up. I definitely think I received trauma to a degree from it. If I smell burning hair it instantly makes me nervous. To even look at Suboxone while I'm on morphine makes me sick.

Anyway, Oxy has always been my DOC which started out blowing like 1/4th a 30 every couple days turning into a full out binge and experiencing my first heavy withdrawal symptoms 2 weeks ago.. which I got thru and decided to just binge again... anyway, iv recently been able to get some 8MG dilaudids for $5-$10 a pop but only a few at a time. Snorting these was typically my ROA but noticed they weren’t hitting me as hard as I’d expect them to. (My oxy habit was 30-90MG a day with some days only doing 10-20MG with occasional 1-5 day breaks with Suboxone/no sub- with my heaviest usage lasting about 2 months) My tolerance to opiates is built up some but the effects from the dillies were bare to non and just had me feeling well. Until today, After constant lurking, researching and self battle I made the decision. The decision that has me feeling bliss and the warmth I used to get from oxys when my habit first started. I crushed up 8MG, put a small line to the side to blow because I enjoy the feeling and mixed the rest with 2ML of water, grabbed my oral syringe and shoved it up my unwelcoming unexpected bootyhole which I’m sure felt violated. I pushed the syringe about halfway deep and injected the water dilly cocktail and clenched like iv been holding a steamer in for 48hrs. I went back downstairs and after 5 minutes was kind of worried I wasted it and it was absorbed by some hidden lurking turd up there but I was wrong. After 10 minutes I felt it, the bliss that was long gone - The warmth and comfort that took me in the first time. I see posts all the time about ROA for dilaudids for those who don’t IV (Which I will not do for reasonings of having a heavily addictive personality).

Tell me again how this works?,"I have been reading up on addiction research, because I would really like to understand why this is such a hard problem to solve.  How does it work?

Because I am reading that it is about chemicals in my brain. They call ‘em neurotransmitters. Drugs release them, stuff like dopamine.

That is a chemical that controls how rewards work. I do some coke, release dopamine, feel awesome, the reward center in my brain is activated, so now, naturally, I want more.

Simple. I buy more coke, do it, get more dopamine, etc etc.

So you can watch youtube and see that we have it all figured out.

But wait a minute. Too much dopamine makes me feel like shit. I am anxious. Nervous. I just want to feel better.

Obviously coke is not a good way to do this. I need some heroin to calm down.

Heroin, you see, is an opiate. Opiates affect the neurotransmitters called endorphins. They help change your perception of pain, as in feel none.

If you exercise, your body releases endorphins, which make you not depressed and happy. You get a reward for exercise.

Hold up, I thought dopamine did the reward thing?

Now it gets even weirder. Cause serotonin is the chemical that is supposed to mediate happiness, anxiety and mood. It stops you from being depressed.

Ok, now you are just fucking with me.  You just said dopamine motivates you to seek out and achieve pleasure. That it would make you happy. And too much dopamine makes you anxious. But serotonin does this stuff?

Hmm, confusing.

Also, there is the neurotransmitter called Gaba. It chills out the nervous system. It regulates anxiety and other things.

Didn’t we just say that dopamine affects anxiety levels? Too much dopamine can even excite you to death. And what about endorphins? Take that dope away and you are guaranteed to get anxious.

There are other neurotransmitters. Acetylcholine, glutamate, norepinephrine and more. You don't even want to know what these ones bring to the table, because then you are going to cuss me out and tell me to stop this bullshit.

Then there are hormones, which are also chemicals but another type of beast. Some, like testosterone, can make you feel aggressive, happy and powerful.

Hmm, that is funny cause I thought neurotransmitters did that. I thought they controlled your mood and made you feel good.

Yes, well you see, it is complicated.

Yes, complicated as fuck. I do not believe there is a single human being on earth that is capable of really understanding what is going on at this point.

Maybe a computer could do it, because there are some really powerful ones. The problem with that idea is that computers require human programmers.

But humans require exact, logical data and rules to write code. Data that we apparently do not have. So that won’t work. At least right now.

So we are left with many, many paradoxes. Some people can taper off addictive amounts of opiates in 3 or 4 days, pain free and be fine. Some people try for months to taper off and still have to kick hard at the end. Wtf? How does that work?

Good old mama nature never, ever, does things the easy way. Which is normally a good thing or we would all probably still be one cell organisms floating in a pond somewhere. Evolution is trial and error and increasing levels of complexity.

This stuff is just not that easy to understand and there is definitely information missing from the puzzle. Maybe we will figure it out in the future. I don’t think we will be able to fix addiction until we do.",1551190337.0

So while strolling through the fields tonight, I saw some very low priced Oxy IR of a dosage I've never seen before. Looks like they're unmarked yellow circles in blister packs, and are listed at 40mg. Previously, I had only been aware of 40mg being available as XR, so I was pretty curious as to what these were.

After some Sherlocking, it seems these are endocodil, a Mexican pharma brand. From what I hear, there's a tamper-proof coating to prevent snorting, however the coating has been described as similar to the old OCs, and can therefore be remedied pretty easily.

My ROA for Oxy is always oral (better BA and I just don't like snorting in general). I typically take mboxes and the like, so not used to dealing with tamper coating. If these are truly IR and I'm going oral, do I care about the coating, like, at all? Will it take longer to start working, similarly to what I've heard about XR?

I'd love to hear some firsthand experience with these. I was only able to find bits and pieces of info about them, and only a couple of posts here, with very little feedback from those who have taken them. Any differences in the high or silly shit like that, or is it just straight up the same?

I did harvest some from the fields, and should be able to provide my own experience in a couple of days, but I'd like to have the most data possible about it before going all pacman on them, so I figured I'd ask some questions in the interim. I will say, if they're 1:1 legit, this will def be the new hotness for me, less than half the price of any other legit pharma IRs I've found. ",1551180215.0

I feel like my heroin usage isn't too high, and I really don't want to be addicted to suboxone but I figure if I keep going this way my heroin use will be stupid high and it will be worse than the suboxone addiction will be anyway. I really wish you didn't have to go on a 'program', and instead could just have suboxone on hand for whenever I feel the urge to use heroin.

Edit: For anyone else in this situation that sees this post, the people in the comments were right. I took subs every 2 hours till I felt better, which amounted to 16mg. I still felt pretty shit, so I waited 12 hours and took more Suboxone. Still felt like shit for a while, but after 22 hours after I'd taken the first dose, I feel like I did before I even took them.

**So, have you been noticing any weird dissociation effects or cannabinoid effects?  Has the fent feeling changed?  Are bags still just as ""hot""?**

I'm well aware that Fent is being made and coming up from Mexico now, but I think thats being distributed in a different way to different people.   I think things are going to get weird on the streets for a bit unless someone is still supplying easily and directly without having to know a ton of people.  I also know there are some fent labs in the US here and there, but I also don't think its going to replace the huge amount that was being bought from china.    


I mean, how long can all the kilos last that were purchased?  Ive read in some invite only forums that some pill pressers are running low on Fent-HCL, A-fent, Fu-f, etc and aren't quite sure what to do next.

I imagine many of us would do a crazy amount of drugs. That's what Hermann Wilhelm Göring did during ww2 when he was a major leader of the nazi party, 2nd only to Hitler. Dude was in charge of the luftwaffe and other stuff. Ppl used to complain about him nodding off in important meetings and he commissioned a painter to paint his portrait and the dude painted him with pinned pupils bc the artist would only paint what he saw. Göring was rumored to shoot up with a custom golden syringe. He was also incompetent. Allies used to say that even if given the opportunity to assassinate him they should never do it bc his incompetence was such an asset to the allied war effort. He was the 1 that let the British escape at dunkirk. He also dressed really insanely. He was a fat incompetent nazi bitch but sometimes I like to fantasize about being in a position like his. Unlimited access to literally any pharma drugs you craved. Wouldn't that shit be insane? You guys know any other interesting junkies through history? I'm a history nerd hardcore lol. 

If I were in his position I'd probably be banging pharma grade heroin, dilaudid and cocaine mixed together. May throw some oxymorph in there also. I'd also be taking benzos and I'd have a team of drs and nurses to follow me around and keep me alive lol. What would you guys do?",1551147004.0

I was mixing up my shit when I noticed he left his digi. So I called him and he asked me to meet him at the nearby Target. I met him went inside to wash my hands and I knew it wasn’t smart but I can’t use at home (my wife thinks I’ve been clean for two years) so I Made the fateful decision to shoot up in my car before leaving. It was about ten PM. I noticed my connect still going around meeting people. And after about 20 minutes I saw him get in a car right across the aisle from me. I tied off my left wrist and tried to hit in my hand. I had my dome light and my IPhone light on  to show the whole world what I was doing. I couldn’t hit my hand so as I went into my wrist I looked up and saw my connect get out of his customers car and walk towards me. After he passed me my radio display went off in my car connected to my phone that he was calling. I thought I had registered so I didn’t answer. I don’t know what happened next if they just opened the door or if I saw their light but the next thing I knew cops were opening the door and shouting at me to drop the needle. They pulled my out of the car yanked the tourniquet off , handcuffed my hands behind my back and dragged me to a car. There were three cars and three cops searched my car while three questioned me. Cops are really paranoid about getting stuck so the cop searching me kept asking if I had anything in my pockets and I kept assuring him I only had my keys wallet phone. He knelt down behind me to empty my pockets and I said I’m sorry this is weird but I really have to fart so I’m going to turn around and back a few feet away. What?! A cop asked are you serious. I repeated myself and said I’m sorry but I don’t want you to smell it back there. I did as I said I would and then they told me to sit on the bumper. I felt like crying. I had gotten my wallet stolen and I had an old expired license and a temporary paper one so my sister had to rent the car, so they were probably going to impound it. I was going to jail and I didn’t even know if we had enough money for bail or if my wife would even bail me out. I took a deep breath and was honest with the cops. How long have you been using heroin? A couple years. What are you doing down here’s dropping something off for work. And you thought it would be a good idea to just shoot up before you went home. No I knew it was a bad idea. Look there isn’t an excuse I’m not trying to justify this. I’m in a method program ... it doesn’t look like it’s doing any good. No I have been good but I’ve had a rough couple of years and the last month has been really tough. What’s all the equipment in the car for. Well that’s why it’s been so hard my truck has been in the shop for a month and I couldn’t even afford to rent a truck so I rented this car. Look I know everyone must say ok I just wanted one last time yeah right. But really I just slipped up recently and I know this isn’t the answer but my brain tells me I’ll feel better. I’ve made an appointment to see a therapist and get back on my medication and I was using until then. One of the cops came up with a meth pipe and asked me where the meth was. I don’t have any. I have a pipe sure but I don’t have any speed. Going through my wallet they must have seen my needle exchange card but never mentioned it. They ran my record and saw I had been busted for possession like a year and a half ago, cited but not arrested. We talked some more and I was brutally honest with them. Look growing up I was pretty anti drug but I’ve had depression as long as I can remember. And again this isn’t an excuse. I was molested as a child my parents hit me. They divorced and then my dad really started beating me. My mom died. So one day I tried heroin and then I didn’t have to think about the things I didn’t want to think about that made me sad ... it “worked” I made air quotes with my hands which is hard to do with your when behinds uh the oof I I your back for a couple years I never got sick, but I’m so after I got off my medication i suddenly started doing it every day. Instantly addicted. so you just went right into heroin? Why didn’t you try smoking weed? This came from a black cop. Look I know this sounds crazy because I do heroin but weed just makes me sleepy. So maybe you should get back on your medication because this isn’t going to be good for you. It’s going to cost you money, you’re going to go to jail. It’s not good. Look I never thought I would be doing heroin growing up and again let me say there isn’t an excuse to use it, but it’s sad it’s everywhere. And I need to get cleaned up first but I want to one day speak at schools or something and if I can get one kid not to make my mistakes then I might feel better about what I’ve done. A couple officers wished me good luck and left. This is getting long so I’ll cut the the chase. I wasn’t arrested, my car was not impounded I was cited for misdemeanor possession of heroin, and misdemeanor paraphernalia. The last cop incurred me and handed me the ticket and told me you need to call an Uber. Why? Look you were just injecting heroin I can’t have you driving impaired. I didn’t inject Anything, check the needle no blood in there. Look I’m trying to give you a break ok. Fair enough can I call
Someone to pick me up? After twenty minutes he got a call and had to go and warned me one last time not to drive. I waited another hour and kept calling my connect but he wouldn’t answer, and then I left and drove home. My connect asked me the next day if I was trying to set him up. Why? Because I’ve never heard of anyone getting caught with a needle in their arm and not going to jail. So there’s my story. Has anyone else been caught and not gone to jail?

I’m very aware of the danger that these 2 CNS depressants combined can have, however I genuinely don’t enjoy oxycodone on its own that much.

I feel dosing then drinking 4 beers or so after it makes the high much more euphoric compared to just dosing the oxy which I don’t feel any significant euphoria from.

I know I get legit oxy 100% so I’m confused at why this is.


Does anyone else enjoy this combo?",1551132975.0

At the time I had always told myself, ""I'm only gonna smoke pot every now and then with some friends, no alcohol or nothing else, just pot"". Well that was fun, started partying a lot, just the teenage lifestyle. Well I had started smoking pot everyday not thinking it of anything. Well as a lot of us Know weed eventually became boring and just a habbit. I started drinking just socially and found my way into pills too... First it was just popping em, then I started, crushing them with drinks, then snorting them. Then one day I was at a friends house and he brought out some coke and I was like ""oh holy sh*t, wonder what this is like"". We poured some on the table and each did about a line and a half, I felt the best and energized I ever had. Time went on, I Went into highschool still smoking pot and doing a lil bit of coke now and then. Well of course that got boring too. That was when my life started going down hill... I found meth. First time I used meth (at 17) I did a skinny line and immediately felt the best I had ever felt in the world. I felt like a could run around the whole world in one night, everything just felt right and figured out. Well obviously I kept using it all the time. I started losing my morals I had set. I would do anything just to feel some sort of high, Steal, Lie, Hide. I would stay up days at a time almost as if I would set a contest for myself to see how tweaked up I could get. Then one day around when I started college I couldn't find any meth around. That's when I found the magical world of heroin. I ended up OD'ing about 3 times in 4 months.

Currently I'm in a halfway house.  My stay here is a nightmare and i will start with the general bullshit that effects everyone in my house,  its become more and more restroctive over the years to the point where coming from a long term rehab program to this halfway house was litteraly a step backwards in terms of how long I can be away from the house and attending meetings and what not. When i first got here I was put on a two week blackout period where I wasn't allowed to leave the house except for outpatient.  Even to attend a meeting.  this was made exceptionally dull as they dont have any programing here what so ever and only one tv in the house (as well as this your not allowed to have your own)  if I didnt have my phone and guitar I would have surely relapsed out of being bored and while I did have these things many people arrive here with nothing ... No phone no tablet no anything ... Litteraly just the clothes on their back.  Those people are forced to sit here and quite litterly stare at the walls or watch tv for two weeks straight.  Your not allowed to have any food or beverages in the house either (only in the kitchen) not even a waterbottle.  Also they have a system for medication where sometimes you can wait over an hour standing in line to get it.  Surely this sounds like a recipie for disaster and i am only listing a few things, mainly my biggest pet peeves.  The rules in this place are stacked to the brim.  There is a rule for almost anything you can think of and a way they expect you to do it.  Now even though I dont agree with these rules I follow them to a t because I have a daughter that I dont want to be stopped from seeing.  Possibly the only good thing about this place is that even though you only get 20 hours out of the house a week after your off the blackout is that after a month you can infact leave for passes over the weekend.  I have my daughter every weekend so this is something I look forward to.  I go over to my moms house every Friday and spend the weekend with my kid.  This brings me to my current situation.  This particular house has a very tight smoking policy.  They have a specific area right at the border of the property where you are supposed to smoke.  This is my only weekness as now twice while walking twoards this area i have gotten caught by staff lighting my ciggarette before i get there.   The first time they wrote me up for it no body even mentioned it to me... It wasnt brought to my attention until two and a half weeks later on a Friday afternoon before i was about to go on pass to see my daughter.  My pass had been filled out since that Wednesday yet nobody said a thing ... When it was finally brought to my attention at the last miniute Before I was going to leave I got upset obviously as i was being told that i couldnt stay over night last min. And i would need to find a baby sitter for my daughter or cancel the plans all together.  Now they are fully aware of my situation and how it works.  When i got upset they said i have an attitude problem because i slightly raised my voice and got frustrated and dropped a few f bombs. Whatever.  I followed there rules and didnt spend the night at my moms house and my mom was able to care for my daughter while I was gone for the night. Come today I get woken up and told i left the house too early and am never supposed to leave before 8 am. This has never before been mentioned to me, people litteraly leave sometimes as early as 530 to get methadone and when I asked other residents AND STAFF EVEN they said that it wasn't true.  So of course  I am frustrated right from the start.  Then next i get told that I got another write up for lighting my cig. On the property (now this time i really didnt, it was off the property and i am sure of it).  I am trying to just accept it and explain to her I didnt realize i was on the property and she keeps interupting me and will not let me finish, talking down to me like a child.  The whole thing escalated and I was accused over and over again of having a bad attitude and being ""verbally assaultive"" to staff.  What she means is I spoke in an agitated tone and dropped a few frustrated f bombs.  It ended with her cutting me off every time i try to speak, saying that she refused to talk to me and i needed to go calm down and that tommorow i would have to sign a contract saying that if I didnt stop being disrespectful to staff I would be kicked out.  She litterally picked apart everything i said and twisted every word I said all while talking down to me like i was a piece of shit.  What they mean by disrespectful is that i got upset when they told me i couldnt see my daughter next weekend because i lit my cig. To close to the property.  Any time I got upset or disagreed with her she accused me of being ""verbally assaultive"" and disrespectful.  I personally dont understand how they can threaten people with discharge for getting upset and swearing a few times.  How is that ok?  Also when I say I swore i mean that I swore while talking and describing things.  I never swore at her.  I never called her names or disrepected her.  I used a few curse words so that i could describe how frustrated i was.  Now I'm at risk of getting kicked out of this place and even though I dont want to be here... Right now I need to be... There is more to it than that.  I have been told by the one single staff member that is an actual human being here that they talk about me in case conference and in the back office ... They talk about what they think my religious view are stating specifically that ""i might be in a cult"" and that they are scared of me and all sorts of other negative shit about me that he wouldnt repeat.  The reason being is i often wear band tshirts with inverted pentagrams or other stanic Imagery, have a baphomet phone pop and also often hang artwork I do in my room that reflects this and have a baphomet statue and what not.  Now I dont want this staff member to get into trouble so there is now way i would out him ... But I am certain I am being persecuted for my beliefs ... There is more to it than this that leads me to think so but this is already long as fuck.  I just dont know what to do and am extremely frustrated.  I seriously follow all the rules even if I hate them because i dont want to not be able to have my daughter for the weekend.  Now thats being taken away from me over bullshit.  Its not right and I really think they are trying to force me out of here because they dont like me/what I believe in and because they dont understand it.  There are people here who break multiple rules a day and get multiple write ups a day and even they are not on contract.  People have relapsed and they let them stay.  Now I am being threatend with discharge for a few f bombs and not agreeing with them.  I'm open to any suggestions on what to do even if its negative spit it at me...

I've posted in the past but, like most of you my addiction started innocently. I have acute crohns disease and a partially collapsed spines that cuts the nerves to my left leg almost completely off.

I had surgery removing a large amount of my small intestines, my illeum and gallbladder. I was put on oxy 20s 6 times a day for 16 weeks and I couldn't stop for about 3 years. I was told I'm a perfect methadone candidate because it lasts longer and would help control my pain. No one told me about the reality till it was too late.

I found out within a month that they don't want you better, they want your money and want you to always come back.

I decided to just cut it off, took my Sunday take home and the following Monday started my detox of not going. I knew what withdrawal was like, but never realized that methadone was a different beast.

I went through it all. Not sleeping 3-4 days in a row and when I did sleep it was for maybe 3 hours. The pain came back so intense I couldn't do much but curl in a ball. The random crying was embarrassing and immasculating, I couldn't go out in public; but the worst was the fluctuating body temp especially with the severe sciatica. I can't stand it not being 80° and when I was normal 70 was perfect.

I can't say I'm better but I'm getting there. My neurontin is helping a lot, but I'm mostly out of the woods.

I want everyone to know that its hell. Its probably the worst experience you'll have, but when that clarity of mind starts to form and you realize that life still goes on things are shown in much brighter colors.

If you have experience with this I'm all ears, especially if anyone can help with my feet feeling like they're in a frozen lake 24/7. I'm tired of running to the bathtub just to soak my feet to warm them only to have it come back 25 mins later.

I don't know where I'm going here, but I want you all so know you CAN make it. You can get off and you CAN get clean. Its hard. It sucks. Its hell. Its also completely worth it. I nearly lost my marriage, and now I have the clarity to love and be loved properly again.",1551119335.0

I work at a redemption center, and people treat their can bags like it's a garbage sometimes. Being the ex junkie I am, sometimes I find empty pill bottles a d I always gotta check them after the customer leaves... In over a year I've never got anything worthwhile but that shit changed today muhfuckas!

Normally if I check pill bottles, I have to be careful because our security cameras are on point and I was on thin ice for the whole ""drinking vodka all day errday at work"" thing, but the power is out so the cameras aren't working... Dude brought in an order and I notice a pill bottle, but I don't understand how he didn't see it.

I paid him and he left and as I pick it up, I can feel there are some pills in it... Turn it to see the name... Hydrocodone/apap, 5-325. There were 18 out of the original 20 of the cute little fuckers in there and the expiration date was last year so I don't think anyone will be missing them.

50 mg of hydro with no opiate tolerance later and this motherfucker is walking on motherfuckin suuuuunnnnnnssssshhhhiiiinnnneeee muhfuckas.

Also, I just got tested for probation, so I didn't have to wait to take any.... Gonna eat the other 8 in a few hours.

Also, I'm at 147 days without drinking so that's cool.

It's not a huge come up or anything, but I'm pumped about it. Gonna enjoy the buzz, the slow day at work, and jam out on guitar! Love you fuckers and hope you guys are feeling as good as I am.

All my friends think opiates are bad and don‘t like their effects but I have litetally tried every drug and a few research chemicals and I can say that opiates are by far the best drug out there. The feeling of pure serenity and joy the absolute calmness and the extremely high body sensetivity are just so far away from anything any other drug does that I just can‘t get away from
them. I am not a daily user I sometimes
binge then stop them binge again but there is nothing that compares to opiates. I just feel so centered and right and calm and down and secure. 

I will one day atone for my sins I know and I know it‘s a slippery slope with addictiin etc. But no drug compares to opiates. 

I really don‘t understand my friends yeah I can understand that they worry about addiction etc but you really

So my plug is officially getting put on to pain management which isn’t the worst thing in the world, but he doesn’t take any of his actual medication. This is where I come into the picture, he asked me if I would provide him some of my pee so he will be able to pass his test and keep this prescription going. 

No brainer right??? Well not really...I know I can’t do pills forever and the good angel on my shoulder is screaming “this is your way out”, the little devil on my shoulder is screaming “GIRL...this would take away the best priced pills I’ve ever encountered ( $7.50 for 20mg crushable oxy and $20 for 80mg OPs) and potentially lead me down the road of $30 blues!”  

I’m in my early 30s and want to start a family with my fiancé and have a normal life....but I’ve been sober before and it sucked ass....I’ve tried being on only antidepressants to no avail. 

Also, I have no knowledge about how the drug testing works..I’m a girl and he’s a guy...will that automatically be directed?? Also if they do know it isn’t his pee, can they get my DNA out of it?? This whole situation isn’t making my so comfortable...

TL:DR should I give my plug (male and I’m female) my pee for his PM pee test? Perk: it would basically force me to quit! Downside: I could potentially end up spending 30 on blues instead of the ridiculously good price I get from him ($7.50 for crushable 20mg oxy and $25 for 80mg OPs)

I knew a few of these people. Once in a while, here on r/opiates, we get the news of someone passing. Remember that cannon going off in hunger games? It reminds me of that.

It is hard for me, personally, to think about people who could have been my friends, wiped out by a pharmaceutical grim reaper. It is human nature to want to blame someone. So I am thinking docs, dopeboys, drug companies, mexicans, chinese.

&#x200B;

I am new to H but I have been or average 200mg of Tramadol and for extreme neuropathic pain for the past 5 years. Sometimes I go up to 300mg but never beyond as it makes me feel like I have to throw up.

&#x200B;

I'll be honest, I never fancied H and the high from H in general. But since I got used to Tramadol and because I have also taken anti depressants for the nerve damage for the same amount of years, that has fucked up my natural balance and getting high on any stimulants like coke or speed will leave me with an uncontrolled strong anxiety for a minimum of 4 days. That has never happened before taking these meds.

&#x200B;

So yes, I do want to get high sometimes and decided to play around with something I sort of know and my body is accustomed to it, given that I am always on opioids-like.

&#x200B;

However when smoking it, it doesn't really seem I get much of a high unless I smoke at least 0.3mg. Now I get I might be having some mildly weak gear, but for fuck sake smoking 0.3mg of gear in one shot seems a ton to me. So I begun considering plugging it if high is same or close to IV. If so, whats the dosage I should go with?

As most of you know I've been sober for about 2 years now using a methadone maintenance program. I'm currently in the process of titrating down my methadone dose and am down to about 50mg/day.

At the moment I'm hospitalized for a painful injury and they have me on 4mg hydromorphone po q2h prn. I'm finding it not very effective at relieving any of the pain and I'm wondering if this is because of the methadone (which the hospital is continuing to administer during my stay). Before I ask for a bump in pain meds I just want to make sure this isn't my old junkie brain just trying to get more and more, but it really isn't working. It's been about a week now and last night the pain was so bad that I took to old habits and railed one of the pills because bioavailability is higher intranasally for dillaudid according to the chart in the sidebar and while i did not get high or much of a rush, it did finally relieve some pain.

Just hoping to getting some insight before I speak with my pain team later today. I tried talking about it with a couple of nurses but they're not experienced with methadone so weren't much help. To them 4mg of dillaudid seems like a lot (lol).",1551094818.0

If you're in you need to have plan A through Z on WD issues, multiple stockpiles of methadone tabs or bupe. Try out a lot of shit when you have the luxury because one day you might not, everything from phenibut to low dose RC stims to see how that goes.

You should honestly be thinking years in advance, and its not too hard to lay down years worth of bupe with a legit script but claiming you need 32mgs a day or whatever. I'd honestly have multiple stashes in multiple locations if possible, non-drug using family or parents often have dwellings wink wink.

Your goal really should be 0 days of forced WD, and never doing something retarded like losing a career over WD.

Then slowly after I got tired of the middle man routine and middle went to jail so I got the plug number straight.

This was both good and bad, my initial use started as smoking tar September 2017 however by November I was using the pick and was all in. I got the direct hookup connection in January 2018 and was full swing ahead. I didn't think it could get worse and my tolerance was mageable, however my girlfriend found out and I vowed to join the methadone program in town. 

Well the methadone got up to 65 mgs, so naturally I started doing amphetamines to stay up and not get sleepy. 

So now I'm hooked on both and my breaks leaving to go to the car and use or go pick up 40 mins away during the work day, as well as my overall attitude and fervor, were starting to get noticed as I had been a very high performer at my job who was seemingly now checked out.

The hr at the firm got involved and provided me a resource to get detox and treatment all while still being paid by work. Ok, although super embarrassing, I'm down to try.

 
So now I'm 2 hours away from home in this detox room at the local hospital and I feel ok, just scared about relapsing in the future.

So unquestioningly I agreed, after all I was cooped up here at my parents. 


I met Val at her grandparents house to begin our night. First things first, Val made us each a wine spritzer, while I chopped up 4 5mg oxys on the counter and chewed on a spare 1mg Kpin.


“So what's the plan for tonight?” I asked, wincing as I ripped the two bigger lines. 


Val sipped her drink and accepted the bill I handed her


“Well I gotta go up to Jonathan's house and take care of the dogs. Then we could go to a bar on our way back” she said, rubbing her nose.


I agreed and that was the plan we followed. 


When we arrived at Jonathan's she fed the dogs and I raided the bathrooms searching for lost opiates or benzos. Drinking Jonathan's lemonade vodka, I think about how sweet it would have been to find a bottle of Roxies. Instead I chopped pill after pill, of 5mg oxys into lines.


‘oh well’ I think while I do another 20mg line. God damn… I point Val to a 7mg ish line for her.


“I don't want you to OD on me, play it careful you're new.” She knows I'm lying to cover my own deep addictions. Instead of calling me on it she, “let what does not matter truly slide”. Besides she likes fucked up me, and I like fucked up Val.


Val had another 10mg line and I finished the 20ish mg left on the counter.


“Why do you always do so much?” Val turned and asked smoking a magically appearing cigarette.


“Well I've been doing this for a while, and after a while you use more.” I said, as I felt the familiar warmth grow from deep with me. Euphoria beauty invaded my mind, as Val passed the cigarette. 


With the cocktail of oxy, alcohol, Klonopin, MAOI's and tar, I was feeling good. Everything melted into peace, love, and opiate apathy. I was ready to go out and party, after double checking my pocket for my container of oxys three times.


Val decided the bar for her and I to go to, tacky decor, a traditional bar, a big T.V., pool tables, and the bar equivalent of a Chili's. It was ok, at least the drinks were cheap.


At the bar we got two house rum double shots, a Red Oak and an Amber Ale Cider. We cheered to the night, slamming our rum. I chase down my shot with the Red Oak and begin prepping a pool table. Sipping on her cider, Val watches me in her predatory way. Always watching like a cat with a mouse, debating how to play with it.


Playing pool we talk trash about life, between turns I gently stroked her lower back. At the end of her successful turn, a high five quickly became a deep kiss. We played like this for two rounds, one ball, one kiss. 


Sitting out on the porch drinking beer #4, we smoked her Marlboro Reds. Every time there was a lull in conversation, like magnets, our eyes met and a kiss was exchanged. Soon it was apparent we needed to get to her place quick. Trying to conceal my boner I carried my jacket in front of me following Val.


At Val's we instantly began caressing each other, under the thin guise of getting into more comfortable clothes. With a record on we could still be heard a block away, lust engulfed us in pleasure. 


Opiates and sex are amazing together, like sex on sex and after two sessions we lay naked on her bed smoking out he window. Completely  exhausted, I try to hold onto consciousness, but the opiates are heavy. Instead I lay with my head in her lap, sharing another cigarette and a new drink.


When Val gets up to go to bathroom I chew up another 20mg of oxy. I'm already touching heaven but I want to be engulfed in its pleasure. She comes back and straddles me, wearing my shirt, black lace panties, and again I marvel at her form. Short, thin, with perfectly proportioned curves. Her dark beautiful hair laid on me right as the opiates took me to heaven. 


As much as I want to ask what we were doing, her gentle caress of my cheek took me away. Back to reality from the clouds, back to her, us, and this moment. After another session Val laid with her head on my chest stroking my arm. I lay in the opiate induced ecstasy that that washed over my brain.


‘If only this could last forever’ I think to myself as I shut my eyes.

Personally I've done suboxone more times than I can count, but never subetex or any other product that doesn't have naloxone included. This is what I'm curious about specifically:


When taking suboxone sublingually, with no tolerance, in order to get high, you don't feel much of an effect at all until about 45 min after taking it, and it takes a full 2 hours for the effect to reach peak strength. Does subutex kick in and reach peak effect faster than this?

When using suboxone to get high everyday, very little tolerance builds up, you can get high using the same dose everyday for months and months without needing to up the dose. Does Subutex work like this too? Or does tolerance build up quickly in comparison to what I've described?


Please let me know the general background facts of your encounters with Subutex please; ROAs, dosages, duration of use, purpose of use, prior tolerances, etc.",1551063906.0

If I don't use it, I won't be able to work. I won't be able to be friendly with customers. I'll be in constant pain, and I'll lose my job. But I have some things going on in my life right now and I really need to get high at night and to just not think about this shit for awhile. If I think about it I want to kill myself. However the bupe has fucked up my receptors so bad that even if I skip a day or two of bupe(only when I'm off from work) and try taking pain pills I still don't get that high. Is there something I can do to reduce to greatly reduce the half life of buprenorphine or knock it off the receptors once I get home? 
I've been doing everything I can to get my mind off this shit. I lost over 1000 dollars gambling this weekend because gambling is the only high that doesn't interact with bupe. Oh, and I do a ton of xanax at night but that still doesn't help enough. My only other option at this point is to get off bupe and just use all day with small doses at work and large doses at night, but it's really hard considering I work in a pharmacy and they will notice if I'm high on opiates more easily than a normal job would.

Btw I have weened to a very low dose of buprenorphine 300-450 mcg of belbuca so no naloxone. And it still fucks up my receptors..

I just need some guidance ya'll, I'm really suffering.

Don't suggest therapy, please. I've done it my whole life and it never helped me. I just need to get high until I get past this hurdle. I've been in this spot before, and got past the hurdle, and I stopped getting high and lived an amazing life on bupe. But last time, during the hurdle, I didn't have bupe monopolizing my damn receptors.

How to get off comfortably? Methadone. Im honestly amazed. I used methadone for just 4 days (first 2 days the biggest doses, then 3d a bit smaller, then 4th a bit smaller again). And then come the 5th and 6th day when you have NO drugs, the halflife carries you. And when the halflife of the methadone is gone you are completely off.

Im just amazed that i can get off dope with ZERO of those shitty uncomfortable WD days. The only thing is I need a few valium/temazepam or whatever to sleep at night, I wake up a bit restless (then it goes away), and im a bit lethargic.

The dope I’ve been shooting tests positive for fent but clearly I have know idea how much or what kind. Now when I dose I just high for about 10 min of that rush then I come down and basically am just relaxed. Sometimes on the comedown I’ll nod out but all in all the high lasts like an hour. I can talk to my parents 30 min after shooting and they wouldn’t know a damn thing, and my mom knows how to spot me being high bc I used oxy for years! So maybe it’s the fent and I just need better dope, but this is also the best dope around all the others don’t even dissolve fully without heating up and their highs suck or are straight up sedating. This one is a nice high and relaxing after the rush. Is this the norm? Or could I expect more from straight heroin off the DNMs? Thanks guys! 


Edit: the dope doesn’t completely disappear after 30 min but it’s a very small high just relaxed feeling for a few hours maybe some nods but no euphoria or nothing just like I’m tired. ",1551036195.0

I have 

28 2 mg sub strips.

About .412 g of ecp that I’m pretty sure has some fent in it.

.8 g or so I think of bth, not fent cut, that’s probably why it seems weak to me or maybe I just haven’t been smoking enough of it.

And a pretty large tolerance I believe. I can sniff .25 g or about a bundle of ecp and just feel a tiny bit nice. Hard to get a real rush or any substantial high from sniffing anymore.

So what should I do guys, what would you do?

It’s been 10 hours and 15 min since my last dose and I feel okay.

I’ve been waiting longer and longer periods in between dosing and somehow my body has gotten accustomed to it and I don’t start to feel seriously sick until at least like 24 hours in maybe more, I hope that’s not because of fent or fent analogues/metabolites. I start feeling anxious and not great at about 16 hours but it’s definitely tolerable up to at least 20-24 hours.

Should I wait until around 20-24 hours or longer however long I can wait and take subs? At what dose, 1 mg? And if it causes precipitated wd take dope? And then try and take 2 mg of subs the next day and try and take more dope if I feel too sick or just chill on the subs if it’s bearable?

Should I try and get high with .25 of ecp and .25 of bth and save the last .16 of ecp and .55 of bth for wd symptoms when I try to switch to subs tomorrow?

Should I uber to cvs get some insulin needles and bang that shit? That actually seems really appealing rn. It would double what I have left but I absolutely suck at hitting veins and I’ve never IV’d street dope with unknown fentalogues and cuts in it and I wouldn’t want to IV black tar either that stuff cooks up gross looking but I’m not feeling like I have many other options.

From my personal and newly pc point of view, this is how I have learned to deal with it.

General rules:

1. No video games.

2. Go outside.

3. Get a cool haircut.

4. Be a nice person.

&#x200B;

To not be bored, I must have fun. Here are categories of fun.

1. Sports – takes practice.

2. Music – as in learning to play. Buy a guitar or a harmonica. Takes practice. Best done in public places so you can overcome your fear.

3. Opposite sex – takes practice. You need to learn to talk to them. They are not that scary. Helps if you are not a selfish jerk.

4. General socialization – people have amazing and cool stories. Look them in the eyes and smile – takes practice. They are not that scary.  My dog is worse. Much worse, and he can't even really talk.

You may have noticed the recurring theme of takes practice. There are some people that are natural extroverts and are talented like that, but lots of addicts are loners. Not always natural to interact. Force yourself.

I know there are people with some pretty severe mental health issues and it is not so easy for them.

And looking for a little info. I got a weird batch of tar this past week. Thank God my dealer only had it a couple of days. 

It dissolves in water fine. But if you dissolve a good sized piece (which you want to to get a good hit) the water seems to thicken up a little bit. So when you try to suck it up the plunger, it will only fill up to about 10 mg and the rest won’t go up. It is so frustrating. Sometimes you can get a little more in taking it in and out 10 times and trying over and over again. 

But you still end up wasting a good amount. I’ve had tar like this before and I’m not sure if it’s the heroin itself or what it’s cut with.

Trying to switch back to suboxone after being on heroin for the last 2 days, did my last hit around 2.5 hrs ago, now this never crossed my mind until now but just realized that tramadol can be used safely/mixed, with either of these at the right dose....

Now normally I know when transitioning/switching from a full agonist(h/oxy) to suboxone/buprenorphine typically you need to wait to be in at LEAST early stages of withdrawal to not go into PWD (Precipipitated WD Syndrome) in order to take your first dose of suboxone


I know that tramadol which is a partial opioid agonist can be used safely/mixed with Suboxone as long as doses are controlled and that suboxone is also a partial agonist opioid, So I was wondering:

**Is it possible, to use tramadol for withdrawals from heroin/oxy etc you get while your waiting to get back on suboxone without PWD??**


Like could I just take a large dose of tramadol as soon as withdrawal from H kicks in (which is around 8 hrs post dose) and just wait maybe another 8-12 or until the tramadol stops help alleviating WD to take the Suboxone? 


Sorry if this sounds like a noob question, just curious if this will work? Have any of you tried it? 

I feel like this might actually be safe to do without the fear of PWD since they are both partial opioid agonists, as long as you wait long enough, if so any details or idea?

I relapsed for one day on Friday and got arrested for DUI / possession of a controlled substance (schedule 4). I KNEW I was going to fuck up (check my post history). I have 6 months clean off of dope but I am still falling the fuck apart. I am a traveling insurance salesman, and I love the job... but I need a driver’s license to do my job. I’m looking at a year’s suspension of my driving privileges because I refused a blood test. I’ve been on one antidepressant or another since I was 11, and none of them have ever really helped. My only escape from that deep depression has ever been through hard drugs.

The only good thing going on my life is my job. I make good money, really like the job and am quite good at it. I’m single and have few friends. When women ask me about myself, the only way I can really describe myself is ‘heroin and pill addict’. I want to reinvent myself but I don’t know how. I am in AA. I have some friends there, but that’s about it. I feel like an alien around regular teenage / college-aged men and women. 

I hope that I can get another insurance gig lined up before I lose my driver’s license, and if I get convicted of a felony, I’ll never have a chance to get into the career that I want to. My lawyer is probably gonna recommend that I go to rehab (even though I’ve been to inpatient rehab 7 times). That means that I’ll probably have to quit my job in 2 weeks. I am seriously considering killing myself because of how badly I’ve ran my life into the ground. What the fuck do I do",1550988547.0

I was in a bad car accident. I wasnt told where my car was for a couple days and when I finally was told & went to see it, I realised they hadnt done ANYTHING to protect it. it was out and open in a parking lot. no cameras. the door was open, car unlocked and since everything was smashed in accident, it literally was wide open. my things were taken, one of which being my script. I called the pharmacy, my dr & the police and was told I was SOL. my dr dropped me since the contract says “lost or stolen meds are grounds for termination” stupid, I know. 

I have been using my tiny emergency supply (literally 3 days worth) to taper over the past 3 weeks so I dont go thru full wd. but the pain is just unbearable. I was hospitalized a few days ago for something serious and I not only have no dr, but no meds. 

I cant get into any office for another 2-3 weeks. I was able to get an appt w a registered nurse who said 1.) since he was my last doctor, he should write a final script until I can establish care w a new dr 2.) he needs to write a letter / note saying it is my final script and he wont be prescribing anymore / wont be my dr anymore. 

he is essentially cockblocking me from finding a new dr. its also making me start the relationship w my future dr horribly since im going in, in pain & desperate for relief rather than being rational and explaining my situation. 

I am gonna call and explain this to him. I think I am gonna ask for a final script since its the due date and no longer would be considered extra / early. I need to be able to leave my bed and get actual sleep. its so unfair that even people w out the chronic pain I have, would have something given to them, but bc they think I have him, I was given nothing for home.

I reminded him that I'm bringing gas *AND* the ride that he didn't fucking have before we left and that he could step the fuck out of the car if he wanted to change the deal. 

So we sat in the parking lot of a grocery store for 10 mins arguing about this shit until he threw me one more. I told him not to call me next time.

About 15 mins into the ride he's counting his pills and spills them right down into the electronic seat slide rails and into the housed mechanism that works the seat. Something like 80 pills **everywhere**.

I’ve posted a lot lately and I’m sorry for bothering everyone with stupid questions but I can’t seem to find anything online. 

I watched an excellent 30 minute tutorial on measured cold water extraction. He used white codeine / Tylenol pills. I am using yellow Vicodin / Tylenol pills (10mg/325mg). 

I am about to pour the solution but the person who was giving the tutorial stressed that the color of the filtered solution should be clear or very very slightly cloudy from binders. I poured a little of my solution after it was clearly separated (albeit the solution above the layer of APAP was still yellow) and the filtered solution is dripping into my glass a cloudy yellow color. 

Have any of you had experience with CWE-ing these pills? If so, what color was your solution after being passed through the filter into the final glass?

When I started on pills I would take them than I started snorting them. This is still when I could easily find OC 80's for $20 a pop. I graduated to heroin when prices of 80's went up and got out before a OC 30 even existed. I started out by snorting heroin both dry and in liquid form. Nobody at the time was smoking heroin much less even pills. I graduated to shooting up and never looked back. Once all these young kids that were smoking 30's came on to the heroin scene it seemed like everyone was smoking it. Now I have smoked it a few times here and there always on a foil and usually using a straw or hollow pen as the tooter (that is what they call it here), Well long story short I cannot shot up anymore and snorting it just does not cut it. I wanted to know what the best way to smoke heroin is. Now keep a mind I cannot afford a Nail (cause I here that is the absolute  best way to smoke it) so what is the best surface to smoke it off of? Everyone I see uses foil. If foil is the best is there different kinds and if so which works best? Now for the tooter, people I see use straws and hollowed pens usually with a thumb tack on the end. What do you think the best is to use? Also how long do you hold it in for? Do you inhale right away than blow it out or hold it in for as long as you can than blow it out? Some people I see hold it in and just blow it out no inhale and others the same but they don't hold it in just blow it our right away with no inhale. All info would help and please no links I want advice from people here that smoke daily and have been for a long time, experts if you will.

Here’s the kicker. I’ve known her to ask dudes for money and some will say yes and I’ve taken her to get it. But they’ve never asked for anything in return. 
She claims this is the first time she’s ever done this (sent actual pictures/videos) 
Also, we aren’t strung out on anything anymore. 
We take ~1.5 subs (my script) a day combined, but have been down on our luck looking for jobs. We’ve been buying Xanax and cocaine if we have a little money but I don’t need that shit bad enough to exploit my girlfriends. 
I know memes about this stuff pops up but how would yall honestly feel?
Was I overreacting to kick her out?
We’ve talked about how emotional cheating/flirting via text is cheating, so this clearly is in my opinion and she agrees and doesn’t know what she was thinking. Her words. 
I’ve let her come over to try to talk and she just keeps getting defensive when I ask questions. 
I told her I just want honesty at this point. 
Any help is appreciated. 
Edit: also she claims she’s never done this before, and has never touched a guy for money or anything like that.

I believe it’s much stronger or damaging than previously thought...,"So I’m a regular kratom user and I take about 20 grams a day.  Pretty consistent over the last year.  Every now and then I will snag some blues from my homie to treat myself.  

Obviously there’s a lot of posts about cross tolerance and all that and some about receptors getting blocked...I’m ducking telling y’all kratom absolutely blocks receptors and builds tolerance.  I have tons of experience with opiates.  Even during my heavy stages of use 60-80 mg of oxy would still get me feeling good.  A tad energized warm and in that opi zone we love.  

Fast forward to this last year.. I would cop 8-10 blues and wait 15 hours from my last dose of kratom and I’ll be so amped because we are talking 3-4-5 months no opiate use at all.  I’ll be feeling shitty from minor kratom WD and I’ll snort a whole 30.  I will get that tired noddy feeling in my eyes and that’s literally it. any warm happy oxy energy feeling I should be getting in completely non existent.  I get it cross tolerance might have something to do with it but yalllll 30mg of oxy after 0 use other than 20 grams of kratom a day?  

I am 100% convinced kratom either alters yours receptors, destroys them, fills and blocks them, or is just way more potent than we think.

For the most part things have been great and my life and relationships have improved drastically for the better. I'm on 540mg of kadian/slow release morphine daily. This keeps me normal and feeling good but not buzzed or high. 

Well this is a positive thing sometimes I do still find myself having awful cravings like this morning waking up. Large amounts of cannabis concentrates/ dabs help a ton i find because in a way it reminds me of smoking heroin and makes the urge go away. However some days I still just want to nod so fucking bad. Or alternatively want to go take some xanax and get the same result.

 I mean maybe I just need to just get high in general more often just not on opiates? Because in the past I used to use so many different drugs ( frequent use of ketamine, benzos, MDMA, acid, ghb and the occasional cocaine or amphetamines)  whereas now I just take my daily morphine at the clinic and smoke shatter. Huge difference in quality of life but damn does it get boring sometimes. For those guys who have been on MAT for awhile  how the hell do you guys endure it? Because I find after awhile I quit suboxone and methadone because of the routine feeling where you feel the clinic handcuffs.

Is there maybe a way to deal with that bitch ass depression that makes you want to hide under your bed?

Is there something that you could learn about that would let you walk around in a blizzard wearing shorts, while you are laughing at the cold?

There is a guy named Wim Hof that has been doing these kind of things for years. The really cool part is that he can teach other people to do it, and apparently it is not even that hard.

This guy has been checked out by some legit scientists. His claims have been documented.

In one experiment, doctors injected him with an endotoxin, basically a poison that would have me in bed for days, if it did not kill me outright.

He pretty much laughed it off.

Wim believes that anyone can do what he does. He believes that his techniques can handle depression and a whole host of physical problems. 

As far as opiate withdrawal goes, I think I have a decent understanding of what happens. A large part of it is that the autonomic (think automatic) nervous system goes wacko and you are sweating, shaking puking etc. and there is nothing you can do about it.

But what if there was something you could do? What if you could take back control and shut it down? Or at least become so mentally tough that it shrinks to a minor problem, instead of a week with your worst nightmare?

Personally, I hope I never find out, because I have already done my cold turkey and do not plan to deal with that again.

But hey, if you are going to do it anyway, maybe you should check this out.

Am I for sure this would help? Absolutely not. But I am pretty much for sure it is not going to hurt.

I just have a few things I’m not sure of yet. 

So my addiction is due to chronic pain that started with prescriptions and then street oxy 30s until my tolerance reached close to 150$/dose once a day, clearly not sustainable. Also the oxy stopped working at that dose and I was very depressed stuck in bed for months because of my pain and addiction . I wasn’t making much money at the time either to afford it so I switched to sniffing dope. 

I did that for about 3 weeks, it was much cheaper but barely did anything to me. No high just some pain relief and still pretty depressed. Then I tried IV heroin. It seemed to do the trick. I only got high for about 30 min from it then complete relaxation for a few hours. But it took me out of my funk. I was no longer depressed. And my pain was gone. 

I have been doing this now for the past 3 weeks maybe 4 every day 2-4 doses a day. I also started working again here and there when I can get work w friends. Now I know this is not something i can do forever. The health risks the money, everything about it just isn’t good for me except for the now of pain relief and depression free. I then came across a post here on ibogaine. Someone did a flood dose at home alone had an amazing trip reliving their life and bad decisions, their childhood ,  and shown the way to live a happy healthy life, and said he experienced “2 years of therapy in 2 days” something I drastically need! He now is free of his opiate addiction, doesn’t smoke or drink either now and experienced zero WDs.

I’ve seen a joe Rogan episode on it awhile ago but didn’t think much of it. Now that I’ve read some trip reports I know it’s something I need. Now a facility costs anywhere between 3-9000$ to attend. They monitor your vitals, give the tests needed like blood tests and ekgs to see if your heart and organs are healthy enough for a flood dose. 

Now even 3k is a lot of money for me right now. I did just land a new job today making decent money but still will be hard to save while paying for my addiction daily. So I’m stuck on wanting to it at home with a trip sitter (I would get an ekg and blood tests from dr just like they would do at the clinics) I’m also on cymbalta which I was told need to be off of 2-3 weeks, no problem there. Also my dope has fent in it so I need to figure out what to do about that. At the facilities they give you morphine injections to get you off the street dope before giving the ibogaine. 

Now here’s my biggest issue. Once I do the ibogaine weather it be at home or at a facility. I’m gonna be stuck with my chronic pain. My back is completely destroyed where I can barely move around for a few hours without being in excruciating pain. I’m thinking pain management but from my experience anything short of IV morphine is gonna do the trick so I’m scared of relapsing for the pain only. I spoke to a bunch of people today that run these places also some people that sell it privately to do alone but couldn’t really help me with my pain issues. I am thinking a lot of exercise like yoga could very much help me as well. 

Anyway if anyone has any tips pointers or ideas or even their own experiences with ibogaine I would love to hear about it!  I’m leaning towards a facility to be safe and they’re mostly all in tropical destinations so it would be like a mini vacation as well. Thanks for reading and hope to get some feedback here!

I have been using for a while, but got off methadone and got off of everything early summer 2017 and dabbled a little bit but not much until about 3-4 months ago. Since then I started doing heroin again, total secret, and have been pretty successful at “chipping” that is doing it just enough to not get sick, keeping my tolerance low through breaks and stuff. 

Recently, however, I have been getting much stronger stuff and there have been a lot of frightening moments. I have been waking up face down or in other weird positions, and just 3 days ago I woke up covered in blood all over my face and my floor, I had (overdosed and) fallen and cut open my chin covering literally my whole face with blood as I lay in it for 15-20 minutes before waking up. I had to get stitches so I I told my family I just slipped on the ice, but the reality was much more concerning. Other less dramatic events have also happened including today, where I woke up in my own vomit clearly in the process of aspiration and I am now trying clear out all the food from my nose and throat. 

It’s just very frightening for me and I don’t want to die but I also don’t want to stop. Thank you for letting me say this as I have no where else to be honest about this shit and it’s fucking scary.

I know she’s just a middle man, and I pay her extra for it I’m sure. But tonight was my biggest pickup from her yet - a whole gram of white, and a half of brown. The white is ridiculously wet, it won’t cut down, and the brown is hard as a rock, like a piece of hard candy. It is definitely either H or a fent analogue. Has absolutely no legs whatsoever, and only a little warm come-up. Quality is ridiculously sub par on both. I don’t use needles anymore, so breaking it down and snorting it is my only option. I feel like if I could shoot the white I’d be alright but I’m not really looking for a binge night, and we all know that’s how it goes when you bang your cocaine.  I spent $260 for all that shit and I got absolutely hosed. Lesson learned, I guess. I don’t mind paying extra, I really just want decent shit I can trust. That’s all I ask for. I don’t use that often, so when I do I want quality.

Hey fam,

I knwo this is of topic but you are the only decent opinions out there. So i have had an on/off love interest over the last few years. She has seen me in the depths of addiction and also been addicted to opiates herself. However doing like our third run of it I lost my father. I really felt like she did not realize or appreciate how huge a loss it is and was for me. We ended up arguing alot and broke up. Here it is over a year later (havent' even gotten laid in that year) and come to find out she fucked and old friend of mine from high school while we were broken up...I never really wanted to break up i just wanted her to appreciate how deep losing your father boss and business partner was a pretty young age. I was and stil am devistated. However i'm taking this fling she had pretty hard. Which is totally not like me. I have been with probably 6 times as many women as she has men...but this really bothers me...I have cleaned up my act as it was when we were dating before but even more so recently in the last year. I have begun to consider marriage and a family and maybe not folliowing my families advice as a prenup if it ever comes to that....I just don't know. Im about to turn 30. I love this girl. she is 26. She loves me i think and says it was never about that but she is hesitatnt to get backk together because her parents don't exactly approve. Go figure right...

I am ready to either make this happen or end it once and for all (even tho its not even a thing yet) I just don't know what to do. I have tried to move on. I have told her how i felt some urgency....She doesnt seem to get it. Im pretty decent looking, have a nice vehicle, a legitimate business, working on a hosue part but a lot is looking up....whats yalls opinions?

Thanks my ninjas

That dropped to 120 a g. The middle man got tired of middling me and gave me the plugs number and now we've been doing business..

My first phone call I asked how much is a g? Just because it seemed like the right shit to do. Honestly, shouldn't have. But I was thinking, I'm not Bob (the middleguy) and he might not give me bob's prices. He said it was 140/g. That's been fine as the dope is 7.5/10 good rush fent free so no worries of spiking my tolerance and it always came hard as a rock with a little powder.... and he delivers. Until the last couple times there was more and more powder. Until the bag from yesterday was all powder. So I hit him up today asking  if he could get a g, if he could hook me up this time with some brick as the last couple times it hasn't been as strong. He says yeah he can get it like that but it's 20/point. I said wow I cant do that all I can do is 140.. so he served me.

What the fuck? And i didn't even weigh it all out but it was probably right at 0.7. When I went with Bob we used to always complain about the wait time (sometimes hours) but say he made it up in quality and quantity. It always seemed overweight and always a bunch of little pebbles or rocks and little to no powder. I was so relieved when he introduced me to the plug because I was tired of the game... driving 30 minutes southeast to get Bob, pick him up and take him 30 minutes north to meet the plug and wait for at least 45 minutes and then get well, take Bob back home and drive back to my house. The whole commute took at least 2 hours not even considering waiting for the plug which... he sucks with time. We used to wonder why the packs were so fat and wonder if he weighed them. Is it because he knows he's going to make money or is he just so fucked up he doesn't care? But lately I can tell he does weigh because his grams are 1.03 on a scientific scale calibrated to the MG. Like he was trying to be exact as possible.

What do I do man. It's like when I was spending less (40,60, 80) I was getting more. I was wondering, maybe he's worried I'm selling it and is cutting it with fiber? He tells me to be careful everytime its funny because my tolerance is so high I want to say chill dude I shoot .1 shots. Or did he literally do this purposely, like reel me in with good product and quality to see if I was hooked and then started selling me cut shit?

So my middle man Bob said the way he got the price down was by buying less. He actually told the plug that he was going to stop using. I didn't understand this or the logic at all but he said that the plug preferred he stopped using because then he would bring the plug more customers. Whereas when he was using he wasnt bringing enough I guess. 

Well I'm bringing this guy plenty of money and wondered if maybe that's it? Maybe he thinks mommy and daddy is supplying all my fucking money and that I'm gonna buy no matter what? No.

I'm so fucking pissed.
And so far, for this week, month... this year... this shit is just icing on the shitcake. God fucking damn.",1550884623.0

A pistol-packing pot grower with a zipper for a mouth called Big Bag was making a move from out on the mesa into town. He intended to capitalize on the isolated heroin market there. We rode with him and his leather-skinned girlfriend on the back roads down to another small town for ounces of heroin, and when we got back to town Danielle and I used our network of junkies to sell his dope. It wasn’t a week before we ripped him off for a bunch of dope. He offered anyone in town a $50 bag for our whereabouts and left promises to murder me on her voicemail. 

We shorted other junkies. They hated us. We stole merchandise and food from businesses. The owners and employees hated us. Several cops in town knew that I was driving the Camry and that I had a girlfriend. They hated us too, but we hated each other most of all.

Danielle had a monthly prescription for 90 Klonopin and an SSI check available on the first. We shot so much dope and took so many pills the first week of the month that our only friend quit hanging out with us. When her orange pill bottle quit rattling and the check was spent, anxiety wrought havoc. She left me freezing at the gas station at three in the morning while I was buying cigarettes and drove by a few times, screaming and giving me the finger for no reason.  Later in the night, we went to the ER looking for meds.

Her Camry became our home. We cleaned out the ashtray at the casino for half smoked butts several times a day and listened to Depeche Mode and Seminole Wind by John Anderson. Our diet consisted entirely of Wendy’s spicy chicken nuggets and Baja Blast. She made me give her a shot of dope visibly mixed with my own blood, to intentionally contract Hepatitis C. That way I could no longer use contamination as an excuse for why I wouldn’t share a hit or a rinse with her. One afternoon I pulled over on the side of the highway and proposed to her with her own wooden ring made from an old long board. She said yes and we made out like two outlaws in love.",1550883024.0

I’ve had it in my head for weeks that today would be the last day I used any opiates. 
I even got my doctor to change my script for the pain killers I get (for genuine pain reasons) from codeine to a non opiate drug (without telling him why)

I have got myself as prepared as I could, 8 days off of work and I have clonidine, loperamide, paracetamol & naproxen for aches and pains, propranolol for anxiety, diazepam, pregabalin and zopiclone to help me sleep.

I also have various vitamins and mineral supplements, rehydration sachets and protein powder for shakes as I know I won’t have much of an appetite but will need to eat something. 

Don’t really want to have to use these but I also have buprenophine 2mg tablets, just incase I get desperate and I’m severely uncomfortable and in agony. 

Wish me luck guys! Hopefully I will succeed in kicking this shit and actually all kinds of opiates for good. 

No one has ever known about my addiction apart from you guys so any support would be appreciated.

Looks like I’m gonna have the ‘flu’ again.. 


I will be keeping yous updated.

Has anyone gone from long term Kratom to a quick sub taper like one 8mg Strip.

Also, if your thinking about quitting, try kratom instead of suboxone for once. although the withdraws arent the funnest, its easy as fuck to maintain.

200mg feels great, until I wake up the next day. It gives me the worst depression, anxiety and makes me suicidal. Have not experience this with other opiates withdrawals, they suck, but this is another level.

Out of the last 60 days I’ve had only 5 or 6 days of using which is the best it’s been in a long long time. 

I’m not going to be a regular chipper just kind of opportunistically I guess. I have an opportunity coming up pretty soon and I know that I need to wait a while so that the sub will not interfere with my quest for dopamine ( I plan on waiting ~36 hours from last sub dose and I’m taking 4-6 mg per day). 

My question is this, since my body is dependent on bupe right now, if I do end up using for say 10-12 hours and then wanting to go back on my subs, do I still need to wait 24+ hours to ensure that I don’t induce PWD?

 For example if I were to use at 8pm tonight, which would be 36 hours after last sub, and use til 8 am tomorrow. Would I need to wait til 8 am or proper shitty feeling according to the COWS scale before getting back on the subs and not get PWD?

During my last semester of college I decided I was going to cold turkey and quit opiates.   


I graduated with my degree in May of last year and moved half away across to the country to insure I wouldn't have access to opiates anymore.

&#x200B;

Feb 11th 2019 marked my first year of being sober. I now work a boring but easy insurance job, I'm saving money, investing in cryptocurrency, and I live close to family which is a blessing. I no longer party anymore, I rarely go out on the weekends because social drinking sucks without drugs, and I also spend a lot of spare time doing hobbies, like designing clothes. My life is a very average, boring, post-grad lifestyle as one can imagine.  


With all that being said.... life fucking sucks if I am being totally honest with myself. I am bored to death and I am developing this fear of growing old and losing the will to enjoy life. How the fuck do sober people enjoy life? I have weekly cravings for erotic behavior. Its been a year of sobriety and I still want to shove roxi up my nose, party my ass off on the weekend and have one-night stands. I just have to keep forcing myself to abstain.  


I lived an extreme life style from ages 18-22 and I am trying my hardest to adjust to whatever a ""normal"" life is suppose to be and it is depressing me.

atk84h,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/atk84h/when_i_was_shot/,39,https://redd.it/atk84h,fuzzmaster_flex,When I was shot,"When he pulled the gun from his waistband all I could think was, “finally”, followed by curiosity about what kind of pistol this semi-rural teenager might have. Was it a shitty $100 Hi-Point that might misfire, giving me a chance to run, or fight? Or was it a nicer Glock or Taurus that had already been used in a murder and sold on cheap as a “throw-away piece”? Unfortunately since it was a generic mid-size black pistol and I’m no expert, I had no idea. I just knew, for a near certainty that I was getting shot that hot and sticky Georgia afternoon.
I was new to town. New to the state in fact, having just driven a laden-down U-Haul from a central Midwestern state to a mid-size town an hour or so south of Atlanta to live with my sister and her boyfriend at the time. I was going there to get clean, as my parents couldn’t take the stealing, lying, and coopting of their car without permission any longer. I drove 16 hours straight, stopping every four hours or so to shoot up my dwindling supply of heroin, so as to not get sick during the drive. I traded off the inevitable violent sickness comprised of frequent vomiting, diarrhea, and severe RLS among other symptoms for a dangerous game of semi-nodding at the wheel. A mix of heroin and simple sleep deprivation had me swerving out of my lane from time to time, meaning that I and everyone around me were very lucky that I didn’t run off the road or crash into someone innocent and unsuspecting, let alone the danger and possibility of a DUI, reckless driving, and/or possession charge. I wasn’t a stupid or oblivious junky, these thoughts more than crossed my mind, in fact they were near constant, I simply pushed them to the side for the time. Heroin has a way of making all of one’s worries fade into the background. I listened to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on tape as I drove, but my eyes were glued to my rear-view mirror when they weren’t peeled for State Troopers on the side of the road ahead of me.
A junkie’s life is a rollercoaster, the hills consisting of having enough drug(s) of their choice to get them through till the morning, although saving that last shot or rock until they wake up is monumentally difficult, as one wakes up every two hours thinking “is it time yet?, hopefully using what little willpower they still possess to wait a little longer. A good comparison would be having a glass of nice cold water on your bedside table, and you wake up over and over totally parched, tongue stuck to the roof of your mouth, throat sore, but if you drink the water (and you have to drink it all at once to feel satisfied) you know you won’t be able to acquire another drink until you hustle up another $20-100. Once the drugs are gone, desperation sets in quickly, followed by a junkie’s dips and lows, usually consisting initially of middle-manning for friends and strangers to make a percentage, risking a ”distribution” charge, though soon enough a day comes where nobody needs anything and sickness sets in. As the dope-sickness sets in, though primarily psychological and only mildly physical at first, more extreme ideas form. You ask family for money for “rent” and “food”, but they are tired of enabling and say they are sorry, but no. So you think of who you could rob, or do a return scam at a big box store, risking a theft or shoplifting charge, but being sick, who cares? You would pawn something but your apartment has been bare of anything of worth for months; televisions, game systems, computers, musical instruments and paraphernalia, the prized hunting shotgun that your Grandfather bought you when you were sixteen and you swore you would possess till you died. You cried after you sold the shotgun, but at least your Grandfather is dead and can no longer feel disappointed that his only grandson is such a fuckup, and at least you got high for two days from the cash after selling it. Two days of numb for a lifetime of shame and regret…should you just kill yourself? 
You could overdose on purpose so it looks like a stupid accident, or lay in front of a train so that there is no chance of survival. You don’t want to scar the train conductor though, as you have some humanity and a shred of empathy left, at least while high or “well” (not sick but not fucked up), although that fades the sicker and more desperate you get. People say that dope-sickness Is like the worst flu you’ve ever had combined with cravings and restless leg/arm syndrome, but it is worse. Your humanity is stripped away, leaving nothing but a wretched, sweating, vomiting, shitting, shell with little to no empathy left. It makes it so easy to snatch a purse, raid Grandmas medicine cabinet or bedroom…she has to have something good! She probably actually does, but it was hidden a long time ago, after your parents called all the direct family to gossip and warn against letting the black sheep roam freely, particularly in the house. 
Even with all the justified restrictions, lack of trust/vigilant surveillance, and tough love, a junky finds a way to get a fix. Long term opiate abuse (which both oxycodone and heroin are) rewires the brain, making getting a opiates more important than anything else, including food, shelter, family, sex, everything. Personally I hate lying. It makes me feel bad, it complicated things, and some lies are just so outlandish that all you can think is, “am I really trying to say my track marks are from scratching bug bites, what the fuck…”, but you’re too deep at that point so you double down. Maybe you get angry that the person doesn’t immediately believe your stupid story while you nod out mid-sentence, or you try to flip it on our accuser, “you drink a bottle of wine a day and you’re accusing me of relapsing because my pupils are small, and I was in the bathroom for twenty minutes?! How dare you!”, or “What, I can’t just be in a good mood?! You want me to be depressed and just not talk?” as you babble about inappropriate things to extended family. I turned into a prolific liar, lying to my amazing supportive parents about everything, day and night: where I was going and why, who with, about money, theft (yes, I stole from my parents and can never take it back, while pretending they had lost the item and were being crazy), what I was on and when, how I felt mentally and physical, how I ingested my drugs, future plans (I had none and hoped to die unexpectedly, hence my genuine lack of fear and bravado in the face of a gun pointed at my chest). I never used to be a liar, and hate doing it sober, but when dope is involved, lying is second nature. You tell yourself that it’s to protect loved ones, but as everything is obscured in a cloud of apathy and drugs, the only thing you want to protect is your drugs. Staying out of jail so that you don’t have to detox is a secondary concern and a drug addict will take insane risks that a sober person would never consider a possibility. 
After the gun had been pulled on me all I could think, and ended up saying, was, “Finally. Please do it, but aim for the head dude.” And the young man (I found out later he was 19 with priors) stared at me, seemingly flabbergasted and at a loss for words in the face of a white boy not scared of his gun, perhaps just surprised his robbery wasn’t going to plan and not ready for outright murder. He compromised by shooting me in the upper thigh, hoping that that would make me realize he was serious, but I laughed in his face, pointed at my head, and said, “no bro, I said shoot me right here, I’m for real, fucking do it”. The thigh shot was thankfully a through and through with no artery or bone damage and at the time I only felt pressure, accompanied by the smell of cordite and the lingering ringing in my right ear, having had a 9mm handgun discharged a foot away from my head in the front seat of my rented U-Haul. Once again he stared at me for a few seconds, perhaps wondering if this was worth the effort and possible criminal charges, but I believe that my taunting and the fact that he had gone so far already prompted him to finish the job. Or at least try to, seeing as how I watched him angle the pistol up a few inches and discharge it a second time into my upper right chest, once again from about a foot and a half away, resulting not only in the normal damage associated with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, but what the doctors described as “an explosive gunshot wound”, meaning from what I understand that the shots were close enough that they caused hydrostatic shock, bursting blood vessels from pressure and incurring extra damage.
After being shot the second time, all I could do is half-double over and moan. No tears, no screaming, no shock (movies and TV lied to me, I was hoping for it and it never came.) and definitely no attempting to walk or drive for help. As he jumped from the vehicle, taking my mostly empty, excepting a decent pocket knife, backpack with him, I wrestled him for it with my working arm for no reason other than stubbornness, but lost the tug of war and off he went. He never got the cash he wanted, the $100 that was worth more than my life, so I guess I win? All I could do was use the phone I had hidden under my leg just in case something like this happened, as I felt a robbery was imminent, but ignored all red flags with dope sickness wracking my body and destroying all logic and reason. Maybe I wished to die, but I called 911 all the same. As I sat hunched over, bleeding and groaning, on the phone with local emergency dispatch trying to get them to send an ambulance to my pathetic near-cadaver, the shooter was apparently opening the back of the U-Haul. 
After opening that rolling shutter door he must have been disappointed by the barren and dusty interior of the truck, which contained only a 2-wheel trolley, so he left the door open, ditched the bag, and disappeared. He, according to law enforcement, then went around the ‘hood bragging about killing a cop. Two problems; I’m not and never have been a cop, just a younger white male Midwesterner. I believe his downfall was simple hubris, as it has been many men, as he was snitched on by multiple people in his neighborhood. I ended up in the ICU, unable to eat, barely able to breathe on my own (thank God since breathing tubes are awful especially if one is awake and aware), and not able to move much more than my feet and arms, and even that hurt. I was in terrible pain and one 12-year veteran nurse told me I was on the highest amount of narcotic painkillers he had ever seen, in part to stop my withdrawal symptoms. I had admitted my past and was on day four of detoxing at home (withdrawal from a serious opiate addiction Is roughly 7 days of hell, followed by 2-3 weeks of very low energy, soreness, and insomnia, so I was in the worst of it when I went out trying to cold cop, and I admit and accept full responsibility for putting myself in the situation that precipitated events) The shooter was eventually arrested and sentenced roughly 14 months later to 15yrs plus 10 or so of probation. He didn’t have to do what he did but I personally believe that he was desperate, living in a terrible environment with no money, and felt backed into a corner in a way unique to men, and black men in his position especially, feeling the need to command respect to survive. It is almost certain that he told some “friend” that his plan was to rob me, and if he came back empty handed, or without having “killed” me, he would be ridiculed and looked down on. He may not even be a bad guy deep down, everyone was innocent once. To be fair, he refused to shoot me in the head, and whether that was cowardice, squeamishness, mercy, or some misguided attempt to avoid certain charges, the results were the same. Maybe he was right, he never got Attempted Murder, so maybe he knew something I didn’t. I hope he can be one of those that exits prison “reformed” and we can have a coffee. On the other hand, he may be a still-violent recidivist. I don’t judge, as I’ve done more than enough to feel terrible about. Life isn’t fair, but we have to deal with it.
After being shot in the chest, which I later learned resulted in: a collapsed lung, 2 broken ribs, a partially destroyed and temporarily non-functioning kidney, a severely damaged duodenum (leads from stomach to intestines, meaning no food for 9+ weeks, which was excruciating), a third of my liver being destroyed, part of my small intestine being removed, multiple surgeries, massive blood loss and a total of around 2 months in the hospital, including learning to walk again. In the ICU I couldn’t even turn myself, which meant the overworked nurses had to turn me every two hours. The pain was honestly mind-blowing and I had a 6”x9” open incision on my stomach for around a week waiting for another surgery, and the dressing changing process on the wound-vac was transcendently unenjoyable. I was unsuspectingly taken one day, flipped onto my huge incision, and held down while a hole was literally drilled into my back to insert a urine collection bag into my right kidney, as my kidney-bladder ureter was all but obliterated. My theory is that the doctors and techs assumed I was “out” during the procedure, but I most assuredly was not. Dozens of botched and successful IVs were administered, 2 of them directly into my leg bones when I was too dehydrated after being shot.
After calling 911 I had to wait for around five minutes for emergency personnel to reach me as I sat in the driver’s seat of my U-Haul, still on the phone with the emergency dispatcher, bleeding profusely. She told me in a slight Southern accent that I would be okay, and to hold on, the ambulance would be there soon. She asked me where I was but I was new to town, so all I could tell her was “the ghetto area” of the town I had moved to four days prior. I don’t know if that was good enough, or if they were able to trace the general area that my call had originated from, but as I moaned into the phone, each breath becoming more labored, I started to hear sirens. I laid on the horn for as long as the strength in my arm held out, and contemplated the fact that bullets are hot, as I could feel the burn of it deep in my chest, shining through the rest of the pain.
The first emergency responder to arrive was a policeman, who stepped out of his cruiser with his gun drawn and shouted at me to put my hands out the window. I noticed that the window was broken as glass crumbled away when I shakily reached out to show that I didn’t have a gun. I was curious why the window had shattered as one bullet was still in me and the other was angled towards the floor. This was also the first time I noticed how severely I was bleeding, as I saw that my arm was painted red from being tucked against my chest wound, which had now soaked my favorite shirt, while the bullet holes in my leg had soaked my shorts. Not that it mattered, as I had also shit myself at some point, a combination of withdrawal-induced diarrhea combined with shock and pain making my situation even more pathetic. The policeman quickly realized I posed no threat and came to the door, asking me where I was hurt around the same time that an ambulance arrived, and things became hectic quickly.
One of the bright red flags that I had ignored was when I was told to turn into a rundown, seemingly abandoned house’s gravel driveway, which made rolling a stretcher to me not possible. This meant that two paramedics had to support me as we walked 30 feet or so to the back of the ambulance parked nearby, this should have sucked more than I remember, but by that point my world was pain, regardless of specifics, and I just focused on attempting to catch a breath with my one lung. I begged for pain meds once I was laid on the stretcher, and as perverse as it sounds I actually felt some sort of optimism that my withdrawal would be gone if they gave me enough fentanyl, but the four medics working around me with a kind of controlled chaos said that I couldn’t be given any pain medication until they stabilized my blood pressure. Personally, I couldn’t have cared less about my blood pressure, but I knew they were trying to save my life, and as worthless and wretched as I felt, I figured I’d let them do their thing. I had to admit that I was a withdrawing heroin addict, partially because all four medics failed to place IVs up and down both arms, constituting upwards of 12 sticks, and also because I hoped for a higher dose of whatever drug they would eventually give me.

I want to be done! Nobody in my family/friend group have any idea. 

I’m on my 4th day of being clean but I have been taking suboxone I bought off a connect. I’m currently stable at 2mg per day - I take 1mg in the morning and 1mg mid afternoon. Almost 0 withdrawal symptoms and I’m sleeping fine. 

I have 16mg remaining and my plan is to cut my dose in half every 3 days until I’m out. 

Will this work? I realize avoiding withdrawal completely is impossible, but I just want to be comfortable enough so that I don’t have to miss work. When I’m finally done with all the Sub, will I be able to get through work? Or do I need to seek out professional help? 

Any advice would be much appreciated. 

EDIT: thank you all for the advice. I think I’ve settled on continuing to half my sub dose every 2 days but only take it when I really need it. Today is my last day on 2mg, tomorrow I will start on 1mg. If I’m feeling okay on Sunday, maybe I’ll skip that day, etc. Continue until I’m on an extremely low dose (.25mg or less) with skipping every other day. And then finally jump off and maybe look into Kratom for when I do jump off. I will not take the subs for longer than 2 weeks. Thank you all for your responses. ",1550844446.0

So, I have heard and read a fair amount of information about the neurobiology of addiction. Granted this is not my field, but the idea is something like this:

Your brain is kind of like an air conditioning system. But instead of temperature sensors, it uses neurotransmitters to control what happens and how you feel.

Drugs mess up these sensors. Your brain gets whacked. You set the temperature to be 72 degrees, but it ends up being 40. 

The plans for this system are hard wired into your dna, the mysterious substance that is like computer code for life.

As we all know from watching the X-Men, the only thing that can change your dna is mutation by cosmic rays, etc.

BUT – it turns out that maybe your dna can be changed by the environment.

What? But X-men issue 193 clearly states that only ….

Yes, yes my child. Be calm. It will be ok.

It turns out that there is a science called epigenetics, which is really even more complicated than regular genetics, which trust me, is a bitch to begin with.

It is sort of about how the environment can affect heredity, but really quick. Meaning like your kid, not thousands of generations from now.

But, didn’t we figure out that evolution takes a really long time?

Yes, about that. Like politics, it seems like the answer is yes and no.

It maybe is well established that people with addiction in the family run a greater risk of having problems. True?

But what about those clean cut kids that see their drunk parents raising hell and swear they will never become alcoholics? 

Pretty common and apparently true. Should they not become addicted when they taste that sacramental wine?

What if I told you that some science guys gave a single generation of rats a one-time shot of an opiate?

What if I told you that the next generation of rats were not as vulnerable to opiate addiction?

Well, you might say. Rats are just stupid like that cause if I could get free dope I would be all over it.

You might be right. However, I am now going to post a link to this article so you can decide for yourself.

(maybe drug nerds could help though - any ideas you guys and gals, I'd be happy to hear 'em). 

I feel like here at home (r/opiates, my home on reddit), that this would be the best spot to post this question, especially since we got some medical professionals here as well as a bunch of other folks who know pharmacology and physiology and harm reduction at a high level, not even for money or a career, but just because they are awesome human beings with an insatiable appetite for knowledge, and plenty of heart to go along with it, as evidenced by all of the folks willing to take the time and effort to pass along good & accurate harm reduction information, as well as taking part in advanced and deeper opioid and even general drug discussion.

On to the topic at hand, we all know that cocaine has a very strong effect on the cardiovascular system. It can cause side effects that can be short term, and merely bothersome or scary (palpitations or pain), or potentially fatal (dangerous or deadly arrhythmias or cardiac infarct or arrest). There are also long term issues associated with cocaine abuse, things like enlarged heart from long term heavy use overworking the heart. And let's not forget other fun things like stroke and seizure, PE and more, these things would be good to avoid as well if at all possible.

Obviously the best most safest thing is to not use cocaine at all, especially not smoking or injecting it. I understand it is a hard drug with many hazards. I choose to use at my own risk and to my own potential detriment, and though in ways that is foolish, I am not so shortsighted with a deathwish that I wouldn't like to be as careful as I can be in such a dangerous risky endeavour, and if there might be ways to make something inherently dangerous just slightly more safe, I'd love to hear it! 

I like to smoke or shoot my coke, and no denying after a good bellringer my heart will start skipping a beat here and there, and it freaks me out. I sometimes wonder what the chance is that it could fall into some dangerous or fatal rhythm. If I knew it was harmless, that would greatly ease my mind, and truth be told if palpitations start I slow down and wait, and they have never gone south on me, though I feel them and it scares the shit out of me. The palpitations don't present with pain, I wonder if there are any vitamins or supplements I could take that would prevent this from occurring at all. I don't drink alcohol while using to avoid cocaethylene and it's increased cardiotoxicity. I also try to wait a good amount of time in between doses. As hard as it is to wait, with the fast half-life of coke I feel like waiting a while (20-60 minutes) between hits gives your body time to break down the dose so that successive doses don't accumulate and fuck with the heart. Oh not to mention waiting makes the difference between a huge hit being shitty or waiting and having the second hit of the day be nearly as good as the first.

So as there are benzos that will help protect against seizures caused by cocaine (overdose?), is there anything comparable one could take that would help insulate the heart from the negative effects caused by cocaine? Anything to help buffer the areas in which cocaine causes issues. For example I read about cocaine causing problems for the heart because of its affect on sodium channels. Now this is where things go way beyond my level of knowledge and comprehension. I can read about how sodium channels work in the heart, and come to understand how cocaine affects this system and the resulting implications, but I don't really have a grasp on what could be done pharmacologically to mitigate the negative and dangerous side effects of cocaine on the cardiovascuar system (if anything at all). I wonder if beta blockers might be an idea? The problem is, this is all hypothetical, and even if there was a good idea, it would never have been explicitly tested along with cocaine for the purpose of seeing it's effects on cocaine in vitro, and this would probably be true of any drug that might help offset the troublesome burden cocaine puts on the heart at higher doses. So there are interactions and other things to be worried about, not to mention even if something like say a beta blocker would be considered to be pretty safe to take and then use cocaine with, and even if it would at least cause no harm at best help reduce cardio impact, it wouldn't really be accessible for that purpose (though it could surely be procured by someone resourceful and motivated enough).

So I'd love to hear what all y'all think, any tips and ideas you guys have. Like I said my best idea is to wait a long time between hits, allowing your body to clear the coke so that it doesn't build up to dangerous levels, and another plus here is that your brain gets a chance to replete some of its neurochemicals and power back up so the next hit is a real bellringer instead of a brain-frier. Also helps make your stuff last longer and makes you less of a fiend. I found that opiates really helps in this regard, where you can do a blast and just chill afterwards, without opiates I'd be crawling the walls salivating staring at the next hit, my watch, and the stem, contemplating saying ""fuck it I'll take the chance on the ole' ticker"".

I would think staying hydrated would probably be a great idea in regards to helping prevent any serious cardiovascular complications from cocaine use. Beyond that just normal common sense stuff, like you would surely be better & less susceptible to dangerous heart scares due to coke if you have a healthy diet, healthy weight, regular cardio exercise, and say a clean bill of health (no heart problems hereditary, congenital, etc).

I also feel like smoking crack or freebase is far safer than using IV... anyone who has ever shot coke and smoked crack knows that while the perfect dose IV is the best way to experience cocaine, smoking a fat rock of some good base comes in a very close second... as long as you have decent product, and most importantly the right equipment (proper stem + chore) and technique... then you can get a righteous bellringer from smoking every single time. The reason I feel smoking is safer is because quality can vary widely with powder, anyone that's ever overdone it on a shot knows what I mean. One time I hit a shot of good coke, and it came on fast and strong, and it went immediately past bellringer to a territory known as pure terror... I was frightened as I felt like surely I had done too much and I was going to die... I'll never forget that, because as much as I love everything about shooting (the way you taste it, the way it comes up slow and smooth and steady), it's super easy to miss that sweet sweet spot. I have mostly memories of disappointment, shots that were weak and left much to be desired. Then I have that one memory of the time I overshot the mark and thought for sure I was gonna die. Not too often did I get it just right, and the way my veins are now it's a crime against myself to binge on shooting coke, I need those few remaining spots for dope). But when you smoke it is way easier to get a solid dose every time, if you didn't quite get there or your technique kind of sucks you can just follow up the first hit with a second. And this might not hold true if you had some like 99% pure freebase, but in my experience I have never overdone it on a smoked hit, even smoking a big fat (baby tooth) sized rock of some fire, the times it started coming on a little intense I just blew out a huge cloud instead of holding it in, and expelling some of your dose is an option you do not have when you inject, another safety plus check mark in the box for smoking being safer. For the experts and pros out there though, I will admit there is one problem I know of that smoking causes (at least in my experience) that IV use does not, and that is the physical act of taking the hit combined with the drug effects potentially adding additional stress on the heart. So here goes for my little theory: When you inject a dose, your heart rate will increase, and as it's a stimulant your respiration/breathing rate will increase, you will breath quickly, and I would assume your heart will be hungry for this extra oxygen as it's rate increases from the cocaine. One thing I have noticed from smoking that concerns me a little is that when you take a huge hit and hold it in, your heart starts pretty quickly jackhammering, and holding your breath might deprive it of some of the precious oxygen it is now demanding more of. Whether this could add to the danger of cocaine use or not I don't know, I try to not be shy or stingy, and I take a big hit and instead of holding it in until my heart explodes I just slowly breath it out... still seems to get me there.

Anyways I'd love to see what you guys think, I know this isn't opioid related but many of you fine folks use all manner of drugs, and I know cocaine is a pretty popular one around here. I really couldn't think of a better place to post it, and I was sorry I posted it over in r/cocaine before I tried here, I guess I thought I'd give it a fair shot but to be fair they don't have anywhere near the community we got here, they are pretty 2 dimensional over there.

Nothing else I try seems to work and if I don’t do more fent when the vomiting starts I end up in the hospital with dehydration induced kidney failure. I’m about to start detoxing again and I’m keeping a couple emergency bags cause I don’t feel like going to the hospital this time, but I also would rather not have to do fent on the third day cause part of the reason for the detox is in preparation for a drug test, so every time I get high, I reset the amount of days I have to wait until I’ll be able to test clean. 

I have zofran but it doesn’t normally seem to work because I’m not actually nauseous when I start vomiting, it’s more like my stomach just cramps up and forces me to throw up without the impending feeling of dizziness/nausea. It’s more of a feeling in my stomach than in my head. Since zofran treats nausea, it doesn’t really make a difference when this is happening. If anyone knows anything else I can do to stop it lmk. Other issue is I kinda can’t keep anything down once I start vomiting so it would be better if there was some sort of preventative solution, or something I could ingest somehow or do that doesn’t necessitate swallowing pills and not immediately throwing them back up (but I’d be down to at least try doing so)",1550823452.0

Not only is he the plug, but him and I met in recovery (lol) a while back. So we both help each other out. 

Anyways, plug (I’ll call him Steve from here) called me up, told me to come downstairs and get my money. So as he’s parked on the street, I’m standing outside the driver side window talking with him. I noticed a set of headlights behind me just kinda creepin... you know, the cop creep routine. 

As he pulls up to the side of us, he asks how and what we are doing. Steve and I both replied at the same time that I was meeting with him to get some money from him. The cop then shone his spotlight on us as Steve was handing me the money. Now, I just took a dab before this all happened so I’m sure I looked pretty high. Not to mention Steve: sores on his face, pale as fuck, the whole nine. The cop continued down the street as Steve and I parted ways 

As I’m slowly walking to my front door, I see the cop light up and get behind Steve... this just happened 5 minutes ago and I’m fucking trippin right now you guys. Why didn’t I just invite him and his friends in the truck to come upstairs for a minute? Or at least stay and talk to him til the cop was gone?

I’m kinda trippin right now. Just the other day I had to tell Steve that if he was gonna serve me any dope to my house, to bring just my dope and no cash. I live downtown in a fairly big city on the west coast, so I’m sure you can imagine the police activity. I already know he got pulled over, and most likely fucked with cause he’s on probation. I just hope to god he took my advice and left any dope or cash he wasn’t bringing to me at home. Although he did just reup. And if that mother fucker was driving around with an ounce of dope, that was most likely my last time seeing him for a while.

Guess I’ll go call him now and see what’s up.. will update.

UPDATE: well I don’t think he got arrested as his phone is still on... I still haven’t heard back from him, but for now I’m assuming he’s alright

Update #2: he’s okay everyone! I dunno how but he managed to get away with either just a warning or a ticket. I haven’t seen him yet but he’s been texting. And I know it’s him texting, he’s repeated things from conversations him and I have only had in person lol.",1550817669.0

atbwsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/atbwsc/the_best_brown_ive_ever_had/,0,https://redd.it/atbwsc,70uGofSubs,The best brown I've ever had,"Well... A year ago I was on rehab... I had been there for a month and a half and was so sure I was gonna quit forever. I got out a month and a half later and lasted only 3 months clean. My brother introduced me to hydrocodone and dillies and that was it, back to gear.  

Since I spent 6 months without calling my plug, he stopped selling and after a couple of weeks he called  me back and said he'd found his contact again but this shit had changed for something I had never seen before. When you cooked it, it cristalized in a very strange and weird way, I made my shot and if I left it there or took too much to find a vein, it started to become crystal, but if you shake the rig, it would go back to liquid! The most crazy thing I've ever experienced after 12 years of daily usage. It made me nod 5ho, but I had to use a lot.

I kept telling the guy to change the gear and he was always like ""yeah, I'm working on it"". So I went on vacation to the south where my country has the biggest poppy fields and kitchens and eventually ran out of methadone... I spent a bit more than a day withdrawing until I remembered a friend I hadn't talked to in a while was from that city.
I called him and after making sure he had relapsed I asked him for a plug  so he connected me with a guy with a great gear I've never tried before, specially after that shit I was using, but it was expensive...

For you to make an idea, where I'm from I paid about 40 usd for 3 gr, but in this city, I  was paying 40 usd for 1.5gr.

Since I knew this gear was fire, I was willing to pay a bit more, so I talked to this guy and asked him if he could ship it maybe bi-weekly once I traveled back and he agreed. 

After a bit more than a month of me coming back, we arranged for the first shipment and got my gear 2 days later so I spent 2 weeks without calling my regular source and he called me, I told him that I was sorry but I was not buying from him anymore and he kinda freaked out and called me a couple of hours later telling me that he had talked to the higher up and guaranteed that he had changed the gear. I asked him to front me a g to make sure It was really a different Bron and oh boy is it different... It is the bag to the left which is almost white with a grayish tone to it. To the right is the one I bought from a different city, which is a bit more brown. Ithink I haven't tried something this good, at least not in years... I just need half of the amount of the other city's dope to get twice as fucked. I hope this batch never ends...

This is the first time in the 1.5 years of doing opiates, that I feel like I'm really ready to be done and get off the pills. 

For the first couple of months I did them every once in awhile and sold most all of the ones I came across. My fiance warned me ""don't get addicted to those things. I don't want to deal with an opiate addict"", but I wouldn't get addicted! I wouldn't be like everyone else, because I had the will to not get addicted. I could stop whenever I wanted! I was really really wrong and she had to deal with an opiate addict.

Im sure a lot of you go through or have gone through the same shit I have been going through for the last year. The seemingly never ending chase to find oxys or hydros. It never mattered how much I had because eventually that would be gone and I would need more. I would drive over an hour in the middle of the night just to get a few 10 mg oxys that wouldnt even make the car ride home with me.

 I threw away hours and hours of my time and thousands of dollars to get high. Its at the point now that I have to spend over $100 a day to keep this habit and its not worth it anymore. I would leave my fiance at home with our 2 kids while she suffered from PPD just to get some pills. I didnt care how mad she got or how much she cried, I was leaving to go get my fix. 

Well today is the first day on my road to recovery. Yesterday I had scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist and already had my appt today (couldn't believe how fast he got back with me). I started Suboxone to help with being sick from withdrawal. Im hoping to get off of it in a week or so. I dont think I remember what I felt like before I got addicted to pain pills, but I think Suboxone makes me feel normal.

Taking pain pills recreationally was the worst thing I've ever done. Im just glad that I'm stopping before I got in too deep. Wish me luck guys. Im going to need it! I can tell this is going to be a tough road ahead.

Now I hate being addicted to Suboxone it's all the negitive opiate effects, constipation, shitty sleep etc, without any of the high or rush. I'm thinking I'm going to dose my subs as necessary to catch a buzz but hopefully not enough to become hooked. They won't prescribe me OCs so I'll attempt to use them as I desire, to get high a couple times a week. 

They only dipstick you monthly so they will not see levels only that I'm positive for bupe. Has anyone successfully done this long term or short term? I want to catch a buzz once in a while, Everytime I'm on subs long term I'm banging stupid amounts of dope to feel a slight buzz when I could be buzzing off the subs.

So for those of you who don’t know or haven’t cared up until this point, I experience chronic pain every day of my life. I had to drop out of school. I’m in too much of a rut to even do my homeschooling. 

So blah blah blah, chronic pain sob story, tOo yOuNg fOr bAcK pAiN, etc etc.

This is where the frustrating part kicks in.

After dealing with an anesthesiologist who wouldn’t prescribe more than muscle relaxers, and who told me I should go to physical therapy over and over for 3 years (which I did), we finally decided that when he told me I should go to a therapist to teach me how to use a cane properly, it was time to drop that useless sack of shit.

So now I’ve started to see Mayo Clinic doctors. My pain medicine doctor (literally the title of his branch) wrote me a script for tapentadol because tramadol popped up as [illegal for patients under the age of 21]. 

The irony was not lost on me or the doctor. 

So I left that office pretty much overflowing with joy. The first pain medicine script after all these years of doctors acknowledging that I needed pain meds, but refusing to write them for fear of losing their licenses. 

Went to fill the tapentadol, insurance says we have to get a generic. Problem is, *there is no generic.* So they said they’ll either cover the extended release version, or it’ll be $200 a month out of pocket.

FUCK. INSURANCE.

I could go on a whole tirade against everything insurance is and how far overreaching they are, but I won’t. I’m sure you all know that very very well.

So now I’m waiting to see how this one plays out. Still bedridden. 

If enough of you care I’ll do an update post when things change. Thanks for listening to this directionless post bbys🥰

TL;DR: After 5 years, was finally prescribed tapentadol for pain, insurance company (none of which are doctors) steps in and overrules the doctor and makes him CHANGE HIS PRESCRIPTION. Waiting to see if I actually get pain meds. 

———————————————

EDIT 1:

So we called Mayo and told them that the insurance would only cover the extended release, to which they said fine and sent over the script. All was well and good and I was to get my medicine in about an hour.

That’s when this fucking DIPSHIT of a pharmacist flags the prescription and CALLS MY PARENTS to make sure they were aware of exactly what I was prescribed. 

He then proceeded to fear monger the absolute fuck out of my parents, telling them tapentadol is an END OF LIFE MEDICATION FOR TERMINAL CANCER PATIENTS and that he absolutely WOULD NOT FILL IT.


I AM ABOUT TO GO ON A MURDEROUS FUCKING RAMPAGE. THIS IS FUCKING OUTRAGEOUS. HHOOOOOOLLLY SHIT. AFTER ALL THIS TIME OF BEING DENIED, I FINALLY GET A LIGHT AT THE END OF THIS TUNNEL AND THE FUCKING PHARMACIST FREAKS THE FUCK OUT AND REFUSES TO GIVE ME MY MEDICINE.

 He is now calling Mayo Clinic over and over and trying to get in touch with my doctor. This is an ABSOLUTE FUCKING JOKE. HOLY FUCKING SHIT. Another fucking day gone with no meds.",1550760316.0

So I was injured 6 years ago and was prescribed morphine sulfate 15mg long acting 2x daily and 15mg short acting 3x daily and want to be off. I am going on day 5 cold turkey and have hardly felt any withdrawals compared to what I have in the past. Day 1 and 2 of course sucked but was incrediably mild, like I had a cold...not the awful ""flu"" we all learned is much worse. I was even able to do some yard work (with several breaks).

The first 24-72 hours I took 6mg imodium 3x daily but what I'm convinced saved me from pure hell was lamotrigine, an epileptic anticonvulsant and I dont understand why doctors dont prescibe this more often for detox. I cant find hardly anything online about it helping but heres what I did find:
https://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=pjbs.2009.33.39

I was immediatly convinced by my second dose of it because it's the only thing I did different without anything else aside from imodium.
We all struggle for sleep and its 1 of many reasons it makes it so hard but I slept at least 6-8 every night and had some mad crazy vivid dreams.

They havent done much studies but once you read the results of their lab rat experiment, it makes total sense. It basically stops your cravings (morphine, cocaine, alcohol and others) and blocks certain parts in your brain. It also increases the opioids metabolism if you take it at the same time so I'm assuming it rids your body faster. I started with cutting a quarter of 100mg and every 4-6 hours took it the first day. 2nd day I took a quarter at 6am, another quarter at 12pm, quarter at 4pm and another quarter at 8pm. By day 5 I'm 50mg am and 50mg pm. I've slept all 5 nights, no sweating, no RLS, no fever, etc. Only thing that lingers here or there is a chill down my neck off and on and ridiculous boredom so have been making myself keep busy outside and inside work. I was able to eat normal foods but very thirsty. I'm bored as hell though, I'm sure everyone knows how you think an hour went by and it's only been 5 minutes plus difficult concentrating but hey...I'll take it over the awful sickness. Highly recommend for anyone struggling. I do not suggest you mix this drug with anything else because of interactions (I was fine with small amounts of imodium). This drug is also know to cause serious rashes in some people, such as Steven Johnson syndrome so just be aware and use cautiously because I am by no means a medical professional...just a guy trying to throw a life card at those desperately needing it.

For anyone reading this, take care and I hope the best for you through the hell you feel.",1550750798.0

But it is hard to remember what they are at six in the morning.

The sun is not even up. My body is telling me, it is night time, you idiot, Go the fuck back to sleep. But somehow I cannot. Sigh.

Roll out of bed, make my healthy lifestyle tea instead of the real heart attack friendly, rush inducing espresso I crave. Turn on the pc and wait for blood to flow. Read the tech news.

Oh, no. They have a trump story. See, this is why I don’t read news news. I cannot afford the adrenaline bump this early. But I feel it happening, my heart starts pounding, blood rushes to my face, my brain goes to defcon four.

Trump wants to give nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia. For peaceful purposes.

Yeah, I totally buy that.

They are going to build reactors for energy. Cause they don’t have anyway to generate solar power out in that vast desert and nothing could possibly go wrong with this scene.

Ok, I am not thinking about crazy arab guys with weapons of mass destruction right now. It is just too early.

Gradually I start feeling coherent, and it is time to get dressed for work,

Do what?

Wait, wait! Is this what I signed up for?

When I was using, I slept till eleven. Soundly.

There was no such thing as an alarm. Nobody called me in the morning. I did not know there was even such a thing as morning. No one I knew could swear that the sun rose in the east or that morning was even real.

Now I know different. I need to make money. I am not sure exactly why this is worth getting up at six, but I must do my duty.

Money is important now. And I can no longer steal, con or scam it up, even though this is something I did almost without conscious effort in the old days.

I realize money can’t buy happiness. You might think it can, but really it is an illusion. All those friends that are coming over now and hanging out while we play music and talk about cool stuff, and drive to fancy restaurants in our beamers and such, that is not happiness.

It might SEEM like it, but really, I would say  it is more like renting happiness. Unless you really have a ton of money, like rock star money. Then you can totally be happy while you tell everyone how miserable you are. This is a closely guarded secret among famous people. You did not hear it from me.

Now, in the old days, I would just roll out of bed, do my morning shot, and I would instantly be happy. Then I would drink some tequila and be even happier.

But actually, thinking about it, sure, the dope and alcohol seemed to make me happy, but it was only temporary.

The thing was, eventually I would have to confront the truth. I needed more liquor.

Now, thinking about this, you might be thinking, is this guy really serous?

No, I am not. Just the thought of having to go out into my little dope world and deal with the cops, all my wonderful dope boy and junkie friends, the drama and disappointment, is enough for me to put myself in check.

I much prefer the sober life, in which I will go to work and listen to people talk about that latest video on the internet, racism, bullying, and what John did at that bar OMG it was so funny, even though we are not really making fun of him., cause we are nice and we are pc. Rock on sjw.
