I also told them that pretty much every pain pill is derived from a poppy somewhere far down the line. I really got laughed at that one but it's true. there is so much bad stigma on how herion is a dark evil drug, when in reality it's not nearly as harmful for you as drugs like methamphetamine, and even cocaine. The most harmful thing about it is over dosing because nobody knows how strong it is. A lot of people that have taken pain pills don't even realize that they basically took herion. this post is pretty much pointless, but I just hate when people down an opiate like herion and even oxys, then they brag about taking ""perks"" or ""hydros"" that time at a party, and call me a drug addict because I started talking about ""roxys"" lol you know those people ",1405464888.0

Background: 
I use oxycodone and other synthetic opiates rather frequently. Sometimes when I don't use, I feel a little crummy, but nothing too terrible, perhaps lethargy, small chills, sweats. But no terrible muscle cramps or pain or severe GI symptoms. 

So on to the point:
I was feeling shitty earlier today, seemed like I was sweating buckets, so I railed a 30, and I felt better. BUT I just took 2mg of suboxone, and I have NO precipitated withdrawals what-so-ever. I just feel really good from the bupe <3 

What the fuck do I make of this? I could have sworn I had some physical dependency, but given that such a dose of bupe administered sublingually, only a few hours after using, has caused no precipitated withdrawal, does this mean that I am NOT physically dependent? 

Perhaps my random sweats are not W/D after all, but a sign of a physical disorder/illness? ( Fuck I hope not :/ ) 


tl:dr: Use often. Took bupe only a few hours after using, NO precipitated w/d what-so-ever, only happy opiate feelings. What do I make of this? Does this demonstrate that I am not physically addicted? ",1405464013.0

Basically I'm asking how long it takes a couple med to kick in. 

Overnight in surgery, I was on morphine and dilaudid. (Sorry for misspellings, between me and autocorrect it gets interesting). Anyway, I didn't want the morphine at all. This was due to a previous scoliosis surgery at 11yrs old. Going through WDs at 11 was hell.  

Back to now, they me on oxymophone at first, and I was stubborn and didn't want it.  Yeah, helped the pain but I didn't like the feeling of bugs on me.  Next, it was hydro 10-325. I could handle it and I didn't get bug face as much, just the tip of my nose lol.  Took those as directed, but now my surgeon says I can put weight and try walk with my frankenankle. This is my 6th surgery on it and it's fused now until I become ""old enough"" for a joint replacement.  Bullshit insurance.  Yeah, I'm 35, but I don't need to be all gimpy at my age. Hell, my hubs (and others) say I should try for disability because of my severe scoliosis and what not.  But I don't want to be another drag on he system.  If Indiana wasn't an at-will state, I'd have a job. 

Sorry, can ya tell I'm a bit pissy? lol So back to the meds going straight from the 10s to the 7.5s, I got a case of volcano butt and my joints hurt like crazy.  My ankle surgery was pretty major.  As my fib is cut and the bottom part is fused to my foot. I have 4 huge screws in there and when spasms hit, it's like a bone and screw sword fight.  (I'll post pics of my awesome X-eat when I get to my computer.  

7.5s dulled it, but it still hurt like a bitch.  And after having 35 years of scoliosis , joints that don't want to stay in place so I pop them back in by myself and now this ankle, I've built up a pretty nice pain tolerance.

So on top of the 7.5s, they gave me tramadol with my skelaxin to relieve this shit. 


Anyone know how long they take to kick in, bc I feel like I'm getting no relief.  If I was back in my home town and not job searching, I'd seek out some relief from a nice bowl. 

tl;dr How long does hydro 7.5s and Tramadol take to get relief? My ankle made by junkyard parts wants to know ;)

so now that induction looms ever so close i feel a mix of two very opposite emotions. on the one hand I'm so happy that I've made it this far and as quickly as i wanted to without increasing my dope habit too much. i want to get off dope, I'm sick of the lifestyle. i want my independence back. my freedom. not having to go to the pharmacy weekly and doctor's appointments. i want my tracks to heal so i can be a normal functioning person. but on the other hand i love dope. i always will. it makes me feel so goddamn good but its taken so much away. my silly self thinks i can control it, but i know i won't be able to forever. sooner or later you always wind up in a mess you can't get out of. but the feeling.....mmmm there's nothing like it. that's something ill be letting go from my daily routine. something I've been doing everyday for years. i don't know what its like to be ""normal"" anymore.

I'm proud of myself for getting this far. but I'm scared. scared ill fuck up and relapse, scared that maybe suboxone won't work for me this time around, scared that there isn't a treatment option that works for me. I'm scared that theres a part of me that doesn't want to quit.

EDIT: so my nurse finally called me back and this is whats happening. Tuesday August 5th is my induction. i basically have to spend the whole goddamn day there. then i go in the following day for any adjustments. she says i would stop taking my juice on sunday BUT i think i will stop taking it on friday just to be sure that its out of my system. i don't want PWD. she also said i have to pick up the sub at the pharmacy and bring it with me to the clinic for my induction. I'm happy i finally have a date set but I'm also kinda freaked out.

Weed at the age of 16, and not long graduation to adderal, mdma, various benzos (not really my thing), acid, shrooms, and virtually anything else. I always been curious, but at the same time responsible. Copious amounts of research was done before I put anything in my body. I knew the correct dosage to take, when to take it, how long it lasted, and how to deal with any negative effects.

My first opiate was oxycodone. Took, and felt, a 5mg perk in class. It was great. Very subtle but noticeable effect. Eventually got and took more. It ended when I was 18 and got my hands on my first roxi. Snorted it all and washed it down with a glass of grapefruit juice and vodka. Euphoria was intense, but the depressed breathing really had me concerned. I liked it too much. I didn't touch opiates again for 5 years. Watched too many family members go down the road and didn't want to become apart of it.

Fast forward to last year when I was 23. My father was in a battle with cancer, which left him in crippling pain. In fact, the doctors never seen someone suffer like he did. 200mcg debt patches, 16mg oral dilaudid, 30mg IR oxycodone, 40mg er oxymorphone, morphine pump placed into his body which put the drug straight into his spine, nothing seemed to help. All the time I saw these medicines and just imagined how it would feel to get one. But he needed them and I refused to touch them.

He was eventually placed into hospice. They took over his regime and the rest of his old stuff was put away. Eventually my mother decided to donate it to the community pharmacy, and it was my job to transport them to the place. Score. I ended up with opana, dilaudid, roxi, er oxycodone, and everything else you can imagine. Sold most of it bulk and got a nice bit of cash. Besides the R's, which were quickly becoming my favorite. I would do a few a day. Eventually stopped easily when they ran out. Went two weeks with no adverse physical or mental effects. I then got a connect. Once or twice a week my girl and I would get 5-7 at a time.

As you can imagine, those got expensive fast. I love the feeling, but loved my money more. Bills, dates, and everything else did and continues to take precedence over a few hours of feeling good.

Monday I tried something new. H. I broke up the little rock (apparently this is very good, but pricy stuff) and snorted it. Due to my tolerance where it takes about a r and a half to get where I want to be, it only chilled me out and made me tired. But today is payday, and tonight I plan to get the full experience.

Before that, I used for about a year, but cut it out entirely for more than 2. I quit and actually didn't like opiates over the course of those two years; one time I got a bad enough cold that I bought some OC illegally to ease my coughing (I can't take DXM; doctors never believe me and just prescribe me DXM, thinking I'm an idiot) and I didn't like it ‚Äî didn't have fun.

But then I fell in love with my current girlfriend. The beginning of our relationship was very painful for me. We were doing a long-distance thing that she wasn't very into, and made me feel like she would end at any moment. I was terrified, and opiates were the only thing that made me feel better.

That was over two years ago. I've been using ever since. For much of this, I was able to keep it to less than everyday. For a long time, I was really only using on the weekends. This is normal. Pretty much everybody goes through this phase at one point or another. ""I can control myself.""

I had this really great chance to clean up a few months ago. I went on a week-long vacation with my girlfriend and simply wouldn't have access to drugs. I was in withdrawal the entire time, which I mitigated with loperamide (more on that in the next paragraph). But... while on this vacation and feeling relatively OK with the help of this wonderful substance, I happened to get a *real* cold. I felt so cheated by my body that *the night we got back* ‚Äî even though I'd promised myself I would get clean for at least a few days longer than a week (the longest I've been clean in over a year), I copped. I wasn't even sick anymore ‚Äî either withdrawing or with my head cold ‚Äî I was just angry. Since then, I'v been using pretty much every day. I can't go longer than two days clean.

Which brings me to loperamide. Yes, it does work. Yes, you can get *sort of* high on it; but it's not really worth it. When I'm sick, I take loperamide until I feel better. I take handfuls at a time, around ten or so pills at once. I'll do a base dose of about 30 (pills; 60mg) and then titrate ten or so at a time (I don't bother counting) until I feel better. What I haven't read anywhere else is about the side-effects of loperamide. When you take enough to not feel the pain of coming off dope, it blurs your vision. For the past ‚Äî I don't even know, eighteen months, since I discovered immodium ‚Äî I've either been high or seeing double from having downed somewhere between 30 and 90 of those little green pills in a day. I'm actually so hooked on immodium that if I *don't take it* before dosing on dope, I don't get high enough. I still feel sick even when I'm on dope because I haven't taken enough lope.

I've been trying to get on suboxone because I'm spending too much money on dope and taking too much loperamide. I panic if I'm almost out of anti-diarrhea medicine; It's pathetic. I was able to get in contact with *two* doctors. The first one wouldn't work with insurance, and would charge me $700 for a meeting. I told them I couldn't afford it. I'm wishing now that I just bit the bullet and did that on installments or something. The second told me that I'd need to be clean for two days ‚Äî initially they said it was an insurance company policy ‚Äî which was a lie ‚Äî and they later said they didn't say that, and that it was a personal policy. I guess I pissed her off, because she won't return my calls anymore ‚Äî despite me assuring her that I would go the two days clean in order to get a script. Today is day two being clean, actually. Still haven't heard from her. 

I've called and left messages for countless other doctors who just haven't gotten back to me. I made an account with naabt.org ‚Äî a website dedicated to pairing addicts with buprenorphine doctors ‚Äî and have called every doctor that supposedly *contacted me* ‚Äî but none of them have returned my calls either.

I blew my one shot at getting on subs ‚Äî in New York City, mind you ‚Äî and now, because I've decided that I really do need to clean up (at least to lower my tolerance a bit), I have to do it with immodium.

Yesterday I took so much immodium my lips were numb. That was day 1.

Thank you in advance for reading.,"Thank you so much for reading if you can get through it all. I'm sorry this is such a long read. Believe me I wish it wasn't.

So here is my story. I'm a 25 year old male. 1 month ago I was an uncontrollable heroin addict. Just for a frame of reference, I sold my computer that had an album that I had worked on for 2 years alone, a computer worth roughly $9,000 due to all the recording software/plugins installed on it, for an EIGHTY DOLLAR fix, that kind of addict. No longer even getting a buzz, not enough money to get enough to do anything besides keep me off dope sick, past the point of having fun, just constant panic as to how I'm going to score next. And oh shit my perfect girlfriend has stuck with me through all of this, so I can't even kill myself and give up like the lazy, scared, selfish little pussy I've always been. 


That's right, I'd genuinely rather be DEAD, than live without opiates. As a background, other than opiates, to this day I've used and/or mixed Weed, Alcohol, Coke, Xanax, Cough Syrup, CCCs, Adderall, Crack, Ativan, Valium, Prozac, Paxil, Welbutrin, Salvia, Mushrooms, Acid, and probably some others I don't remember. Some I used for fun, some for enlightenment, some for crippling depression and anxiety I was born with and ran in both my parent's families, thanks for the double dose of mush-brain, guys! 


So, when I was 18, I got ran over by a truck in a skateboarding accident, pretty much destroyed my whole body. It was so bad my jeans and shoes were ripped off. That day was the day the love affair started even if I didn't know about it then. Three days I don't remember (due to hitting my head), what I do remember is this: to my alarm and confusion, aside from the concussion, road rash, broken leg, ribs, and ass, I feel great! What the hell did they give me? ""Morphine"" the nurse answers, ""Are you hurting, would you like more?"" ... Uh, I just got my ass handed to me by a jeep, hell yes I'd like some more of whatever is making me feel like a super hero. 


I get sent home with a huge script of giant sized Vicodin and antibiotics, and the next 3 months are spent playing The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion and eating Vicodin. Holy shit I could live like this forever. I'm more fun to talk to, more focused, no more trouble sleeping, no more anxiety, no more feeling like I can't go on anymore. This is the best drug I've ever had, and the best part is it's completely unnoticeable to everyone else. No sloppy movements, no red eyes, no reason of any sort for anyone to suspect I'm on drugs. 


Of course I didn't know then that I had any of these subconscious thoughts or feelings about opiates. I was inexperienced and didn't really have a way of getting any more after I healed so I just took it as a fun little experience and left it at that. Little did I know the opiates didn't ""leave it at that"" ... they had much bigger plans for me. It took five years of my self inflicted sobriety - I was in my arrogant ""If you do anything except experiment with drugs, you're a piece of shit weak addict"" stage - for the opiates to bust out of my subconscious. It's October 2012 in New Jersey, and I live 2 blocks from the beach. Hurricane Sandy destroyed everything I've ever loved including the home I grew up in. 


It's funny how your mind being extremely susceptible to addiction caused by hereditary anxiety and depression has a way of letting you think you're doing well and strong and you don't give a crap about drugs until something really bad happens. Fast forward a month of sleeping in parking garages and my girlfriends house like a homeless grub that her beautiful family is now stuck with on top of their home being damaged too. Wow this sucks, I need a break from life. I hate drinking, pot makes me paranoid, coke makes me angry and the crash sucks, what the hell could I do to cut the edge? Man, I remember those Vicodin made me feel warm and nice, it'd be awesome if I could find one, just for the night. Eh, screw it, I'll find some whenever. 


I put the idea on the back burner for a few months until one night my best friend (who also lost his home in the storm and I got an apartment as a result of being homeless together) goes into his room, loads his handgun, and starts writing the note. His girlfriend catches him and screams for me. I have to take his gun from him. There was a round in the chamber. If she didn't decide to stop by that night I have no doubt I would have woken up to a gunshot.
Fuck everything that has ever happened in my life, 5 years of sobriety can go fuck itself, I'm getting high *tonight*. 


I make some calls, some more calls, and finally I find a kid with blues. What the fuck is a ""blue""? ""Are they as good as Vicodin?"" I ask him. He laughs. ""Yeah I think you'll be happy about the results dude."" he says. I get home, do some research, and pop my first recreational opiate. I swallowed a blue on an empty stomach with no tolerance. An hour later I'm playing Starcraft, and it hits me. I'm **thinking** more clearly than I ever had. I'm **feeling** better than I ever have. So it's settled, I'm calling this guy every payday and buying a couple for the weekend, it won't be hard to explain to my girlfriend or roommate where the extra money is going. Why am I suddenly wrecking everyone in Starcraft? Why am I so talkative and kind and pleasant to everyone in public? This is amazing. I feel ""normal"" finally. I feel complete and warm and euphoric. Fuck the addiction thing, I'll just make this a weekend occasion. What a fool I was.


Months and months go by, my weekend hobby is spilling into my week days like the Exxon fucking Valdiz. Work goes by so fast when I'm high, and even if it ever felt slow who cares? I feel like a fucking animal! I'm stronger, faster, and more focused. Although God dammit I am sick of spending 25 dollars on one little pill every other day. I wonder if that shady kid I knew in high school knows where I could get something cheaper. I knew what I was doing. I didn't admit it to myself, but I knew what he was going to suggest, ""Dude fuck blues, the shit I get up north is 10 times cheaper and better."" What a overconfident little boy I was. 


Diacetylmorphine was going up my nose a few hours later, or as most people call it, heroin. My friend shot up, instead of snorting it. It freaked me out pretty good, it was all just so strange. What the fuck am I doing? I just scored heroin in a ghetto and I'm now fucked up walking around walmart with a junkie looking for shit to steal for more dope. Who goes from hating drugs to using heroin in a couple of months? God I hope my girlfriend doesn't find this out. I hope this isn't actually going in the direction that in retrospect I knew it was going and actually embraced it and rationalized it like it wasn't an issue. What a hypocrite I was.


""Don't ever shoot this shit up dude, you'll never be able to stop."" I'm told. ""I'd never shoot up anything, screw that"" I say to him. I wonder which pharmacy would be best to stop at after dropping him off. I go home, put .2 in a cooker, do what I observed to the best of ability, and look up the rest on google. I hit first try. I push the plunger down, and sit back. Slowly it washes over me, and I'm suddenly a god. In fact, God himself doesn't deserve a feeling like this. I am whole, warm, euphoric, painfree, and complete. Like the feeling of being a little kid at an empty playground again, carefree, blissful, not a bad feeling possible. I can do anything. If I had 35 dicks and they were all being sucked at once in a hot tub filled with money it wouldn't feel this good. I haven't texted my girl back in hours, and I never do that. What a bastard I was.


To save you another paragraph, long story short I spiraled out of control like an 80s DARE video. She stayed with me through everything. The mood swings, the shady behavior, the money borrowing with no return, the lies about everything, the distance, the sudden drop in interest with everything, tried everything to get me clean for months while I was an unemployed, distant, sickly little douchebag heroin addict. She's never smoked a cigarette and she's still with me to this day. After everything. I can't even understand why she is. All I know is I can't even look myself in the face after everything. What a piece of shit I was.


In closing I have nothing profound to say. There is no moral. This isn't an inspirational underdog story. I became a fucking animal. A slave to substance. I'll probably relapse some day. I'll probably die with a needle in my arm. But I'll die happy before I die sober because of the law or anyone else and their insignificant opinions.

Never heard of them but sound intriguing. Discuss inside.,"So GF was having pain in her neck and of course went to shadiest doc we could fine.  So he prescribes her 4 butran patches.  They are 7 day patches that come in increments of 5ug/hr, 10ug/hr, 20ug/hr (possibly more but not looking.)

Weirdest part is, not only that I've never heard of OR seen them, But that the doc is going to prescribe bupe to a first time pain patient.  She'll be getting the 5ug ones and after research the whole thing only has about 5mg of bupe total to deliver over 7 days.   

Now I think these would be great taper devices as the dose is so low.  But has anyone had any experience with these?  Doc says it will be the same as taking 3-4 10mg vikes everyday but without the Tylenol risk.  My opinion is going to be to tell her to say they work, but make her feel kind of weird after day 4-5.  Then maybe get something better.  Thoughts please.

So after having minimal knowledge of these things upon acquiring some, I did some research and found it to probably be a good idea to give a heads up. Almost everywhere I looked in regards to dosage/tolerance questions, every forum seemed to show things like ""If you don't have a high tolerance, don't fuck with them."" and ""do a VERY TINY amount!"", but never a definitive measurement or dose. This is dangerous, because most people don't give a shit and are going to take them any way regardless of forewarnings. Dosage is EXTREMELY important in regards to fentanyl because it is insanely potent and is very easy to overdo it because it is measured in micrograms. Furthermore, there is confusion because the patch is made in to release x amount of mcgs over a 72 hour period. So if you have a 75mcg patch, it will release 75 micrograms over 72 hours but (depending on brand) actually contains around 12 MILLIGRAMS of actual fentanyl.

I cut a 75mcg patch into 16 equal pieces. I highly suggest anyone who is experimenting with fentanyl to start with a single piece this size and work their way up. For reference, my tolerance isn't too high...50mg of oxy usually gets me going pretty well. I found these sizes to be a good place to start off at a Cut a piece off and put it in your cheek for about 30 minutes and see where you're at and then go from there.

Also, even when you are using buccal ROA (in your cheek, kinda like a chew), these things still last a couple hours. I had one in for i'd say at least an hour and took it out and put it back in later and got more out of it. This is very important to remember, because the most common hazardous scenario with these things is for people to nod out with one in their mouth and continue to get dosed.

If you are absolutely opiate naive, I would even go as far as cutting these into 32nds - they are really that powerful. 

Another tip, which I doubt anyone will do because it's a pain in the ass, but in the army with the fent lollipops, we used to tape them to a patient's finger, that way if they nod, their arm would fall  and drop the fent out of their mouth. Just an extra layer of safety you might want to take into consideration.

Hopefully this information is clear enough for proper instruction. Good luck, be safe, and have fun. Feel free to PM with any further questions if you are uncertain. Fentanyl ain't no joke.",1405648656.0

Almost posted this in /r/ pharms, but I think I can get a better answer from you guys.)

I have a prescription to take 5 of these a day. I usually take three in the mornings and two in the evenings for pain. I also have 500mg APAP/ 30mg codeine pills, which I combine with the 200mg/30mg Ibuprofen/codeine pills if the pain is real bad.

I'm a bit worried about my stomach, though.. For about a week I have been taking (all together) 120mg codeine, 1000mg APAP and 400mg of ibuprofen twice a day, as it seems to work best for the pain. If I take them on an empty stomach, it will start to hurt quite a bit in my upper stomach about an hour later. I have had my gallbladder and other organs checked and they are fine. Also there is no sign of internal bleeding.

The stomach pain isn't as bad if I eat something or take 150mg ranitidine before I take the pills. My question here is that is it okay for me to take 240mg of codeine, 2g of APAP and 800mg ibuprofen daily in a long term?

I'd ask my doctor, but I don't really think he'd approve of me taking two diffrent pills containing codeine at the same time, as the 200/30 pills were supposed to replace the other ones.

(I also have 200mg Tramadol XR pills, which do work as well as the codeine, but I still prefer to take the codeine for a quick relief. (And I admit, for the great, fast morphine-like kick they give me as well.) My daily other meds are Pregabalin, Alprazolam, Tizanidine and a buprenorphine patch.)",1405626024.0

One of the best experiences I have ever had was my first time cold copping.  I had just moved into Philadelphia and had a good amount of money in my pockets.  My girl had left really early for work that morning, where she would be for the next 12 hours.  I woke up early that morning feeling really adventurous‚Ä¶with an itch that only one thing can scratch.  


Although I was new to the city, a cursory Google search brought me to these two articles in Philadelphia Weekly, entitled [""Top 10 Drug Corners.""](http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/cover-story/Top-10-Drug-Corners-2011.html) The original article was from 2007 and the other was a follow-up in 2011, which is the one I've linked to.  Those articles are essentially detailed instructions and directions to spots in Philadelphia's very active open-air market.  So I read both articles and then familiarized myself with the general area by driving around on Google street view.  I decided on spot #1 on the list- Kensington & Somerset (K&S).  This intersection is notorious for exactly the kind of thing I was looking for, and everyone on the internet suggested that I would be approached with offers without even stepping off the platform.  Sounds like my kind of place, so I throw on some respectable looking clothes and hop on the El at 8th and Market.  The eastbound train travels along the Market-Frankford line to an area of NE Philadelphia, which I would consider ""the hood.""  I‚Äôm getting close to my stop when I look across the aisle and see a fairly clean-cut white guy.  He‚Äôs about my age, and after a minute of glancing over at him, it becomes pretty obvious to me that this guy is doing exactly what I'm doing.  He‚Äôs distributing different amounts of money to different pockets and spots on his person-smart.   So we get to the station and as soon as the doors open, this guy shoots down the steps from the platform onto the street.  He moves with the confidence of a man with a plan, on a mission.  I follow him down the steps and finally get up the nerve to talk to the guy.  It went something like this: ""Hey man, hold up real quick?  It's my first time down here and I really don't know what I'm doing.  It looks like we're here for the same reason but you clearly know where you‚Äôre going‚Ä¶ so would you mind showing me the ropes today and I'll throw you ten bucks or something?""  He looks up at me real quickly and smiles.  ""Ha, yea man that's cool, I saw you looking over at me and thought you were a cop or something.  Ok just follow me and let me do the talking.""  


Now that I have my own personal ghetto Sherpa leading the way, I‚Äôm feeling pretty good so far.  Let me tell you that the folks on the Internet were not exaggerating.  As soon as I hit the street, I‚Äôm greeted by the voices of both men and women, young and old, black, white and Spanish, selling wares that are as varied as the demographics of this impromptu drug flea market.  ‚ÄúWorks,‚Äù ‚ÄúSubs,‚Äù ‚ÄúFire,‚Äù and something called ‚ÄúWhat you need, white boy?‚Äù  My guy tells me not to talk to anyone and just keep it moving.  He explained to me that the spots with the best product and prices were further into the concrete jungle and away from the safety of a crowded intersection.  The theory behind this is that most people like us (drug tourists) are nervous and/or desperate and will usually jump at the first offer they receive.  This is because they don‚Äôt know the area and are much more apprehensive about getting in the cut and walking further away from the main strip and into the belly of the beast.  The locals know this, and as a result, take advantage of the desperate and scared by selling inferior product at top dollar.  Sets that are further away from the station have much more incentive to provide a good product and cut deals because of increased competition.  This is where all the regulars go, they have their certain streets that they cycle through depending on who‚Äôs got the best shit that day, which is shared by other users via word of mouth.


As we weave our way down streets that take us further away from the train station, the landscape becomes dominated by empty lots, boarded up houses, bodegas‚Ä¶ and fire hydrants that have been wrenched opened, unleashing a torrent of water in an arc onto the street, where children are playing and drug sets are vigilantly standing around, open for business.  When I say business‚Ä¶ I mean exactly that.  Having done this hundreds of times now since that first day, I can honestly say that the scene is well organized, efficient, and even professional.  The established sets that do it well,. have 3 shifts of corner boys that work around the clock.  They have dedicated spotters that yell out if there‚Äôs a car or person in the area that looks unfamiliar and is possibly a cop.  They ask what you want, then go get it out of a plastic sandwich bag that is hidden on top the wheel of a parked car, in a discarded wrapper on the street, or in some weeds etc.  They always give you the drugs first or at least at the same time as the money.  They will also give you their phone number so you can call them when you need something.  Most importantly for me, they do not rob, cheat, or intimidate you.  They want to make money, this is their career, and they know that ripping you off one day for a couple of bucks isn‚Äôt worth it if you‚Äôre a good customer that will bring them money consistently.  Ok, I‚Äôm getting side tracked here.


Finally we get to a corner run by a set that my guide is familiar with.  They meet eyes and nod.  The corner boy asks what he wants, he places his order and looks at me, I tell him what I want, and he goes and retrieves his stash after a quick look around to make sure no one‚Äôs watching where he‚Äôs got it hidden.  He counts the bags out in front of us, hands them over, and we hand him the money.   Just like that, we thank the guy and we‚Äôre on our way to this spot.  The sergeant of this two man drug platoon then asks me if I want to get high right then, to which I emphatically reply ‚Äúhell fucking yes‚Äù and before I know it, he‚Äôs leading me to this abandoned house he knows where we can do our thing in peace, away from the prying eye of the boys in blue.
We get to the spot, do what we came to do, and make our way back to the train station, which now has two uniformed officers stationed outside of the entrance.  I start to bug a little because I have stuff on me and it‚Äôs not exactly a mystery what two white boys are doing on the wrong side of the tracks, in a neighborhood that‚Äôs 70% Spanish, 30% Black and 100% drug related.  My newfound friend assures me that they‚Äôre just there to maintain a presence and to just pass them calmly.  We do just that and next thing I know, I‚Äôm riding the El on my way back to the part of the city we call home, with a [pocket full of sunshine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gte3BoXKwP0).  That day I made friends with this guy and we spent the rest of the summer copping together and hanging out.

For some background on my situation, I am a chipper who has managed to successfully do so for about two years. My key is to only use when on vacation from school (unless something just falls in my lap). And although I manage to use only a few times per week at most, this summer my tolerance has skyrocketed. And unless I take 6+ months off, my tolerance only drops by a tiny bit.


I've been considering switching to the needle, and I'm promising myself that if I do, I will slow down my usage as well. My girlfriend doesn't know about any of my use, and trackmarks aren't an especially good look.

I realize I'm playing with fire by chipping and telling myself I can avoid addiction, and my use has gotten to be a bit more than I'm completely comfortable with, so i'm going to try to take quite a while off soon as a reminder to myself that I'm still capable of that.

I know that the advice most of you give to people considering IV usage is simply not to do it, the rush is too good and it becomes much harder to say no, but I want to hear everyone's personal experience. Bonus points from chippers who only looked to get more bang for their buck, as I think that's a bit of a different situation than someone who is already battling addiction deciding to make the jump.

I'll gladly accept any sobering advice as well. Thanks r/opiates, stay safe, keep the sickness at bay, and keep on bein' one of the best subreddits out there.",1405746016.0

I remember getting out of the marine corps and struggling with a divorce...I was depressed and needed an escape from reality and a few of my old high school friends were into Percocet's.  I started buying them frequently and then before I knew it I was getting approved for credit cards with $5,000 dollar limits, I would do anything to get this 30 minute high and I found myself cash advancing $100.00 a day until that card would run dry and then it was on to the next.  I eventually got over my depression from the divorce, but I found myself in a hole...a hole where addicts are stuck and they cant get out without professional help.  I want to add that I've never stolen or pawned anything in my life period and especially not for drugs, I was at least raised right in the sense.  Not too long ago I asked this ""friend"" for a blue, but this time he said he had something cheaper...I wasn't catching on.  I arrived at his house where I had abused the pills time and time again but this time was different.  He pulled out a bag of H and I immediately told him that I promised myself long ago that I would never touch that stuff.  My addicted brain caved and I snorted some, it wasn't a clean ""high""...it felt dirty, but I liked it.  It's now been about a half a year since that day and I continue to struggle with this addiction, I have never ""shot up"" and I never will.

I guess I just wanted to get my story out, I know this is probably everybody's typical story of how they started, I am a good kid just on a bad path and debt collectors up my ass but I am not doing pills or h daily now, its more of a ""couple times a week"" ordeal.

My SO and I have been together a year. I am wondering if he is beginning to to have any concerns (even in the back of his head) about my bouts of ""sickness"". I wonder if it's merely as simple as him thinking that sometimes I just get depressed and therefore just don't feel good, or if he thinks I have health issues or maybe if I'm even just a complainer. He knows I am prescribed hydro for a jaw issue, and I have tried to be forthcoming (without full on admitting I abuse the fuck out of my rx) about me going through them really fast, but I just have no desire to say, ""Hey, when I'm 'sick', it's really just withdrawal, no worries"" especially since it doesn't affect my life, or our relationship.

my clinic says my last dose should be on sunday and my induction is on tuesday at 9am. i dose at night if that helps. I've also been tapering 5ml every week. started at 110ml and I'm at 50ml now and i will be going down to 45ml before induction.

i believe i should go longer without methadone, more like having my last dose on friday. 

so again, how many days did you go without methadone before inducing on suboxone? did you experience PWD from not waiting long enough?

EDIT: thanks for the responses everyone! i got this info on the phone but i see them this week so I'm going to talk to them in person and let them know my concerns. i think that even if they tell me its okay to dose on sunday, I'm still going to stop on friday and just do H up until 12-24 hours before induction. I've induced from H to sub quite a few times so i know when its a good time to induce, but I've never done it from methadone before. I've always heard that the longer you can go without methadone prior to induction, the better. thats why i was a little stumped when they told me that.",1405871653.0

One who is mid tier and two top tier ones that is basically just preference based, they're equally as good, actually I think one is better for IVing & one is better for snorting. So I head over to pickup today & I was gonna buy a half gram of this new fire shit he got in for $120 for a half. Sounds expensive but whatever it's average prices near me. I can get a G between $150-$200. So I get the new shit thank him and everything for letting me pick up so early and especially after he was having girl troubles the night before. Now I get home and don't immediately start using this new stuff I still had some on my plate and a few hits of fentanyl gel left to do, so I do those and move on to the half G which should last me 2-3 days. I'm already feeling buzzed from what I've already done and I did about .4 out of the bag and am not feeling anything from this fucking dope. Now ordinarily this wouldn't be too big of a deal because I'd have more money to go score from my other dude but I don't happen to have the extra money this week nor the gas to get out to my other guy. Do you guys think it's fair of me to ask for a discounted half of the good shit, he's always a hard ass about prices but this shit was bunk didn't get high AT ALL. I think that it'd be in his best interests to give me a good deal or a free .3 with the option to buy a $70 half. I've been steadily buying from this guy for the last 3-4 months 2-3 times a week so I don't think he'd all of a sudden decide to fuck me over but again I think that if he doesn't do shit about it I'm gonna make my backup my main guy and my main the backup because that's some straight b.s.. I'm kinda just fucking venting now but I was wanting to catch a nod tonight but nothing and especially on the week when I have no more fucking money well $60. Hopefully my backup will front me 4 bags and let me buy 4 bags so I can be good for the week otherwise I basically just got fucked.

I am using .2-.3 tops a day for the past 3 days. I have been IV'ing the whole time alternating between the same veins on both arms in the crooks. (The outer large vein and the vein right in the crook.) clean works, proper filtering, 29g long-tip. Yesterday I shot up in the left arm in my outer crook vein. I didn't hit at first so I gently wiggled around for a blood draw, saw the register, and checked out. Well, when I was pushing the plunger I noticed it was hurting for some reason but kept going because I watched it register. Now my arm is seriously in pain in my left crook. It hurts to even move it or squeeze well. Just need advice anything helps sorry for the long read.

TL;DR: used long tip 29g needle felt pain as I injected. Had to wiggle needle around for register and saw blood then injected. Arm still in much pain in the whole crook

What i'm talking about is some weird experiences regarding sleep, specifically confusional arousal vs. OD.

Now to put it as simply as I can, during periods of heavy use of heroin (specifically in situations where a physical dependency was present) I noticed that numerous times a week I would find myself waking up from deep sleep in a state of panic that was coupled with the sense of dissociation, (the feeling of not knowing who you are, where you are, what you are, or what you are doing) this feeling would last from 30 seconds to around 3 minutes depending on severity, often times upon awaking I would also notice parts of my body being numb and my heart pounding out of my chest. There were times where I woke up suddenly with the feeling that I was seconds away from death and just so happened to fight it off and survive, and I say this because I woke up to my heart beating through my chest, breathless, and jumping up to find myself weak and my vision slowly fading to black. If I focused enough I would be able to come back and relax after about 5-10 minutes.

Now, I talked to other users who have some what experienced the same thing as I did, but not quite to the same extent, I've never had an experience like this from other opiates, but even during times where I was under physical dependence but still dosing regularly lightly just to curve withdrawals it would still happen sometimes, noting that it is not necessarily related to OD and might just be an opiate thing it's self.

I read a little bit into Opiates and their effects on sleep patterns,  but was unable to find anything conclusive on the matter. So i'd like to ask some of you if you've ever experienced any weird sleep occurrences while under the influence of dope.

Whatever, I still don't understand...but they have him at the county jail on a 72 hr DTF hold. He doesn't have any charges yet, cant make a phone call, im sure bored out of his mind. I'm stressed as fuck and no one will even give me a straight answer about anything, so I call his bail bondsman from the last time he was arrested to see if he can tell me anything. Ive never met this guy, but he answers and he can apparently tell how stressed and annoyed and upset I was, but Hes one of those good ole country boy types, so he talked for like 45 minutes trying to reassure me, and somehow managed to make his way into a conversation about his love of opiates, so i had to tell him how much i love some Roxys. anyway, he tells me to meet him at the jail so we can try to figure something out....I get there, we go in, the lady was a cunt, and I had absolutely had all i could handle then and started crying. So we go back outside and he pulls a bag out of his pocket, hands it to me and says I brought these for you, i had some extras, i think you need them worse than me. It had 2 Roxy 10's 2 Roxy 15's and a bar in it. So, thank you, kind stranger. You have made my day so much better, and my house cleaning so much more fun!

How does that not violate HIPPA privacy policies? Junkies are going to get their shit no matter what.

Also, stop being dicks about the laws on selling needles to people without prescriptions for them. You're not stopping anyone from using drugs.

I was just about ready to head out to meet my guy who lives about 45 minutes away and about 10 minutes before I was about to head out he shoots me a text saying ""Hey are you on your way?"". At this point I'm kind of confused but go back threw our texts and realize that he told me to meet him at 9:15 and not to leave at 9:15. Usually I am told when to leave and not when to arrive. So I'm already 15-20 minutes behind and he has to be to work at 9:30/9:45. So I grab all my shit do a couple lines of ice to fix my sleep schedule, and so I can drive like a madman. I hop on the freeway and am going 15 over passing everyone I can doing everything I can to get there as fast as possible. 

Now I'm driving towards Chicago and I see a sign about 10 miles from where he's waiting for me that 6 miles ahead that traffic is stopped. Like the worst possible time for a traffic jam. I'm freaking at this point thinking how I'm gonna get there on time. He says I have 15 minutes and I'm at exit 26 and need to get to exit 19 so alright 7 miles that shouldn't be too hard. As soon as I pass exit 26 the traffic has stopped. Know my guy needs to get to work on time & I understand that but I wasn't going to have driven 45 minutes to get nothing. So I decide I'm gonna take a risk. I start riding the shoulder of the highway going 80 mph weaving in between cars to try and get there on time. All of a sudden the three lane highway turns into two I blast into a big construction barrel and cut across to the other side where there is enough space for me to drive on the shoulder. As I go to cut across again I hit someone's boat hitch and just say fuck it and keep going get around him get to the other shoulder and floor it as at this point I can see the exit. 

Surprisingly there were no cops at all and I know I was being reckless as all hell but that's what dope will do to you. I end up getting my six bags. Do some in the bathroom and look in the mirror before hand and my pupils are almost fully dilated from the adrenaline from the whole thing. Share some of your stories as well, I'd love to hear them and I also have a picture of my current stash.

If you've been lurking long enough, you may remember me from a few months ago under the name ""Fentthrowaway,"" during which I posted a question as to how to go about using Fent patches as a naive user.

Well, I did one at the time, over the course of about a week.  Aside from being fairly useless while on it, it was a very pleasant experience.  Once my single patch was gone, I had no means to get more, and experienced perhaps very mild W/Ds over the course of a day or two.  Maybe they were psychosomatic.

So I recently indulged for the second time, on a fairly serious bender.  Three patches in two weeks, basically pinned for the entirety.  Seriously, 24 hours a day - towards the end I'd wake up with the patch(es) still on my gums.  Fairly heavy drinking as well.  When I decided I finally needed to get my head straight, I didn't even consider that there would be repercussions.

Well fuck, there were.  I'm about 4 days into a very illuminating W/D.  They started about a day and a half after the last dose, and by fucking god, I haven't felt this miserable in a long time.  Sweats/shivers for days, no sleep for three days now, shat myself twice.  I've lost 10 lbs over the course of three weeks.  Anxiety to the point that I considered suicide.  It was only a day or two into the W/D that I realized that it wasn't a normal illness.  I'm only really starting to feel a return to normality now.  But I still fear another miserable, sleepless night.  And having just read about how potentially miserable Fent withdrawals are, I suppose I can consider myself lucky.

So I've really only danced with these things twice, but fuck, how the hell does one return to this?  I mean, I enjoyed them well enough, but certainly not enough to warrant going through this again.  Fortunately, I don't have a steady source or friends who use, so even if I do get a craving, it's unlikely that I'd be able to fulfill it.

Anyway, cheers to those who manage to use and be human.  I've danced with this devil, and my legs are tired.  Thanks to all for the help along the way.  I gotta go shit water.  Again.",1405894516.0

Gabapentin - my miracle pill for withdrawal. I should have plenty of this to make my week fairly comfortable. I have successfully and fairly easily made it through W/D with this chemical before, but I don't think my addiction was nearly as bad last time I did this in January. This pull also encouraged me to use though as I was able to think if things got outta hand like they of course did, I could just fix it with gabapentin.

Etizolam - I have at least a half gram for sleep.

Bubba Kush - I bought an ounce because I can't do withdrawal without copious amounts of weed. I had to sell a little bit to be able to pick up my bottle of gabapentin, but I should have plenty. I know I coulda sold this for dope, but I didn't bother and I am glad because I need this monkey off my back.

2 grams MXE - I heard it could help alot, I have only tried it once but I have plenty if it helps make me comfortable during w/d!

250 mg ethylphenidate - came as a sample with the mxe, so I will use it to give me motivation to work without opioids.

30 mg adderall - same reason, I should be able to take this by fourths. Hopefully I can stay productive at work during this monster.

Need to pick up some : LOPERAMIDE !!! ASAP!

Let me know if I am forgetting any essentials! Hopefully I can do this right and go back to having money and stuff without being broke all the time blowing money on dope! Anyways, I am still enjoying my last high for quite some time so I am gonna get off and see if I can nod a bit ; ) ... I know the pain will come soon enough! I have to make It through this once more!",1406041466.0

Apparently the site appointed a new admin kid ""fatpie"" and because of this admins attitude the site has been subjected to numerous denial of service attacks.Also the site owner ( an admirable guy johnny M) has had personal info( site info/posts etc) couried to his employers and the comp board of directors .Johnny was also a director of the comp, so i am told..And because of this info Johnny M has been fired from his job,removed from the board and given a week or so to remove the opi server from his now ex employers building.

I have been told confidentially all this has  been done because of the behaviour of his appointed site admin idiot username fatpie.
The sad fact of the matter is opiophile ran for yrs under the guidance of sensible righteous people.But since this idiot fatpie has been at the helm the site owner has lost his job, the site is under attack and its just now a real disaster.ALL BECAUSE of the behaviour of this admin banning people for comments made in the flame forum ( where all insults are permitted except racial) and his general superior attitude of being the intellectual superior of site members and when he got butthurt played the banhammer.

I have had up to almost two years sobriety and life started being a little much to handle. So I slipped up and six months later I'm now nearly stable. Mentally I feel like my lady h is a bitch who I wish not to fuck.

I'm almost positive I'm through with any withdrawals. 

My next step.. adderall?

I've been taking it roughly now for the same year and a half, but from the streets.
One of my biggest hurdles with dope was that I was blowing my check so now money should be saved better. I want my own script for adderall like I had when I was young.. due to moving around a bunch it might be difficult to locate old records, so I may only be able to 'say' that I've used it as prescribed in the past.

What's the most plausible scenario living in Boston with great work health bennys where I can obtain this prescription and carry on with my life.

Are the steps I'm looking at: Pcp, then psychiatry? Or should I hunt a psychiatrist down who's available on my health care program...

Plugging is my main ROA. I made this little guide to help y'all out!



Step one: Obtain drugs and do happy dance. 

Step two: Poop. If you can't, oh well, but at least try. 

Step three: Break your drugs down as finely as you can. 

Step four: Mix them with a little water. I use a shot glass to mix. With Morphine IR, I just drop it in 1ml of water and it dissolves within a few seconds with a little stirring. With blues, I'll usually break them down most of the way, then drop them and stir. 

Step five: Get your oral syringe. Dip it in the drug water and pull the plunger back. I usually bring it back about another mL even after it's all in there, just so I can shake it up to make sure it has all dissolved well. 

Step six: Apply lube, spit, Vaseline, whatever to your syringe and bootyhole. 

Step seven: Lay on your left side for best absorption. 

Step eight: Insert your oral syringe all the way, then press down on the plunger. And remove. You can get up immediately or keep lying there for a few minutes to let it absorb better. Doesn't matter all that much. And there you go. 

I usually get another 2ml in my oral syringe and then drip it down the sides of my shot glass to get anything I missed, then plug that.",1406010205.0

I learnt that the answer depends on one's suboxone dose, length of time using, metabolism and a number of other variables, and that it is best to wait at least 24 hours. So I am approaching the 12 hour mark and I will report how a regular dose of 0.1 raw dope feels.
I can not bring m
I am ~140 pounds, have a not too bad dope habit, IVd 1 mg suboxone as a one off, experienced some but by no means significant relief from withdrawal symptoms. I am in mild w/d but am being somewhat held by the 1 mg dose of sub.

So I prep my shot, shaking with fear and excitement. I am particularly attentive and take my time. 
After I shoot, I feel something, though not the characteristic dizzying rush. I fall back and close my eyes, relieved that I am getting some sedation and stomach un-knotting. 2 minuted in and I feel a somewhat muted and actually qualitatively different high. Unusual pressure on the front of the head. When I stand up my balance is slightly off. I would say that this is 40-60% of how I would feel without the morning sub. Slightly less euphoria to physical effects ratio.
I am just relieved, and feel sheer gratitude that the torturous cravings and inhuman feelings of chills and fever and misery is mostly gone. I'd love more, but am saving 10mg for the morning that will give me the psychological comfort to accomplish things in the day tomorrow (namely selling my possessions to buy more precious dope)


I will update in an hour as to whether effects are increasing or whether the high dissipated faster than usual etc.

Please share your personal experiences with taking H, oxy etc. after dosing subs, especially of the results were unexpected.
Love you all,

I haven't had a huge tolerance build up, but do need norco 10/325 for relief rather than 5/525. Beyond that, never gone over the daily dose.

Am I safe to take Stadol NS or do I need to totally clean my system of any past use? If so, how long to be safe?  I have a huge dental appt. at the end of this week and would love to be able to try it after for pain but I am still taking percocet (1 to 3 a day, depending) for another condition.

I open the box and there's a bag of 35 oxy 15 IR's staring me right in the face - my hear skips a beat. But there's more in there! I get to digging and end up finding $600 in cash, four and a half 2mg xanax bars, six 30mg vyvanse capsuls, four 10mg ambien, nine 50mg trazadone, a zubsolv, and this other teal/aqua capsule that's a sleep-aid... and a fucking HBG rig! I'm a very avid weed smoker, well oil as of late, but nonetheless I was at a loss for words! Had to join so I could share my find with ya'll

TL;DR - just moved into a new house. found a box in the attic. box contained $600 cash, multiple types of pills(opiates/benzos/misc) and a rig to smoke oil out of.

(I know, this is r/opiates, but i need info on drugs and jail shit) Anyway, his bail bondsman got him out last night, so he's home! I have a few questions for any of you who have caught possession charges tho.
Short story: We went to get him yesterday at 4 pm. They gave us his booking sheet that showed his charges to be possession and no proof of insurance, but couldn't find the citation, or a court date, or figure out who the arresting officer was...even tho I told them, and the paper the ladyman cop was holding clearly said the guys name. We seriously waited 4.5 hours for them to get their shit together. So they finally give us an updated booking sheet with just no proof of insurance as his charge. They said there was a 'goof up'...more like a major fucking mistake, but whatever. He gets out and tells me the DTF officer told him if he didnt roll on someone they would file charges (On Wednesday) for felony possession and paraphernalia or instrument of crime. He told them no, just to charge him, and they said ok and told him they would set bail. So my question is, is that even legal?! Can you be arrested for something, not charged for it, released, then charged for it later? I realize the system is seriously crooked, so they can do pretty much whatever they want, but really?! Im gonna have to bail him out again for something he was arrested for and not charged with?

A second question: let's say it is treated the same as a refill in that regard. What if the new prescription is slightly different, say the previous prescription was 7.5 hydrocodone, and the new one is 10mg.

I have had like maybe 7 grams of some mau duang or whatever and I haven't had a single urge to use it all through my withdrawal. I have eaten gabapentin like candy and it helped majorly, I have had no gastro symptoms and minimal diarrhea after a 5 month heavy heroin addiction with kratom and lortab for a couple months before that. With gabapentin etizolam, I have been pretty much symptom free except for chills that I can't control. The moan thing bothering me is lack of any energy. I popped my last 15 mg of adderall this morning and still haven't been able to get out of bed.

The reason I had to do it is because I HAVE to finish cleaning my apartment today as I have 2 potential roommates visiting. I had been eating lots of gabapentin since 4 am and popped an addy at 8 but still no energy at all. I was able to clean a little bit last night when I took a bump of MXE after eating GABA all day, but then I went to a friends house and stayed there smoking pot... So this morning I couldn't get out of bed... 

However as I feel the kratom being absorbed, I feel I finally have energy. It is only of fraction of my normal dose. When I started kratom (which lead me back to H) my starting dose was 6 grams and I would usually take 10 grams after I was addicted (haven't taken the shit in months mainly because I hate toss and washing that nasty shit) I really really hope this doesn't prolong my w/d (my main reason for posting). I have almost no money so I can't even afford more kratom, and I filled my gabapentin yesterday and it's at least half gone, about 10 grams since 12 yesterday, so that's why I haven't felt too bad. But I worry if my w/d is prolonged, I will run out of gabapentin and immediately hustle some money up to score...



*TL/TR took a gram of kratom 72 hours into detox from 5 months moderate daily heroin use, do you think it will extend things. It's only a small fraction of my normal kratom dose,*

Almost 2 more grams of kratom consumed. I am hopeless... What a bitch I am, not even experiencing all of the true nasty symptoms I should be and still can keep my fucking willpower. But this is probably the toughest time of my life so idk what else to do. I am financially fucked already so I can't go back, but I don't know if I can take what I am about to have to go through without something as a crutch stronger than weed.

I KNEW I SHOULDA TRAsHED THat SMALL AMOUNT OF KRATOM!



Edit 2: well the 3 g of kratom did exactly what I needed it to. Idk what I will do from now on, I guess just take it a day at a time. I wanna stay clean, but Life is hellish, my worst nightmare that I always feared would happen looks like it may happen soon.



Edit 3: Well things just went from bad to worse as I got new the person I am worrying about is in the ER. There is no way I can resist more kratom and opioids now. I will probably go home and steal pills from my family. fML I can't take this pain!!!",1406296817.0

I'm sure that anyone on subs that takes them for therapy would sometimes like to catch an actual buzz off of the things. These are a few things that any opiate user worth their weight in scraped stamps knows, but this is an easy guide that well help you catch that buzz every now and then. You can't do it all the time of course because then you'll gain an even greater tolerance.

First off, don't shoot. There's almost no point in it. What we're going to do is plug. The BA for subs is incredibly high and you don't have to worry about losing any keeping it under your tongue and between your gums. It can be a little difficult without tools, but it's possible. You'll basically want to fold it as dense as possible and shove it up there about an inch or so. Or better yet, you can get a very, very small oral syringe and fill it with warm water. You'll want to take that warm water and put it in something like a small bottle cap. Drop your sub in that cap and stir it with the syringe until it is completely dissolved. Plunge it back and stick her on up there. Before hand you are going to want take about 600mg of Tagamet for CYP inhibition, 100mg DXM and 50-100mg DPH. You can then follow with a strong cup of chamomile tea (which is what caused me to pass out (: )

I can't think of any better way to do this. Plugging kicks in almost immediately and practically has the same IV BA and you don't have to worry about it gooping your veins. The DXM and DPH are a given. Tagamet doesn't seem to work AS well as it does on some other opiates, but it works great on bupe for me.


Well, for all of those taking subs everyday and are missing getting a buzz try this method out and get back to me. And I guess you could always just take benzos : p.

Let me give you a bit of background before i explain what happened. I recently had spinal fusion in February, and have been on medication for pain for 2 years. I entered a pain center to begin treatment and a tapering program. After 2 visits and 2 clean urine samples, i was accepted and made an appointment to begin prescribing my medication. A week later, i received a phone call explaining that i had tested positive for heroin at my last urine test. My life at that moment fell apart. i have never even SEEN heroin, not to mention that it only stays in your system for a day or two. why would i take heroin the day before a voluntary urine test? They immediately notified my surgeon, who was prescribing my meds, and my my doctor. both informed me that they would not prescribe my medication anymore. 
i was on a dose of 120mg of ms contin and 24 mg of dilaudid daily. 

needless to say, this was a nightmare. i have never taken heroin in my life, and i offered to submit any type of test there was to prove it, but i was denied. i spoke to everyone from my dr, to the surgeon, to anyone who would listen, and they told me that the only way that i'd be able to get proper medication before going into complete withdrawal, was to enter an addiction treatment center. this hit me like a ton of bricks. i am NOT an addict, I am dependent on the meds that i've been taking responsibly. I cannot enter a treatment center, as i have two young daughters to care for. 

My only option now is to space out the remaining amount of dilaudid, so i don't get sick, but as i've been on a large amount of medication, i'm scared of what's to come. I came here asking for help, feedback, information... anything.  thank you.   ",1406243682.0

2bme8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2bme8l/two_years_ago_today/,90,https://redd.it/2bme8l,Sober_junkies,Two years ago today.,"Two years ago today I found my little sister dead on the floor of her bedroom.  She had overdosed on methadone.  My life would never again be the same. This was the beginning of the end for me.  I've spent months ""going through the stages of grief"".  I've come to a place of acceptance but what doesn't change is the pain.  The constant void that aches, I wish I could say that I was able to heal & change myself.  That I took this experience and grew but I didn't, I want this so badly, yet sometimes I just *want to want it.* 



Sometimes all I can do is sit in my pain, usually with a needle in my arm. I let it overcome me and be everything in my world. There are times, however fleeting when I can see things other people can't. I now have the ability to appreciate what others take for granted. My life remains gloomy and dark to me, but I can see glimpses of the beauty in life as well.



No one should ever have to find a loved one blue in the face and cold to the touch. I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone. No one should ever have to bury their 14-year-old sister.  Life is fucking cruel and unforgiving at times, *what I'm trying to say is that my pain sometimes lets me see the light, & sometimes I'm completely fucking blind.*  Below is something that I wrote about the day my sister died.  



It started off as any other seemingly normal day.  We were celebrating the end of summer.  The last few hours I spent with my sister are blackness, tainted with the smoke of marijuana and the bitter taste of rum.  My dad came out to tell us to keep the noise level down.  My sister comes stumbling back from the bathroom, visibly drunk.  My dad is immediately upset and tells her that she has to go to bed.  My last memory with my sister is telling her not to worry and that I loved her. 



It seemed like forever that my dad sat lecturing My boyfriend and I, this was the last straw.  I remember it seemed like I looked up and he was suddenly gone, ""Where did dad go?"".  Sean looked up and replied, ""He went inside, where did June go?"".  ‚ÄúShe went to bed.‚Äù  Then everything goes black as I slipped back into the robot I was so comfortable being.  Sean shaking me until I come into consciousness, glancing at the clock, 4:26AM. ""Are you crazy? Leave me alone.""  ""Come on Xea just a bowl and a cigarette."" I grudgingly agree and pull myself up.  I looked around for my ever needed Ipad, it was nowhere to be found.  I had a sudden feeling that June had probably stolen it.  



As I walked into her room she was laying on the floor with a pillow over her face.  I laughed at the strange way that my sister so often slept when drunk.  Sean suddenly appeared at the door and a look of concern flashed across his face. ""Something is wrong..""  He leaned forward and yanked the pillow off her face.  A orange puke stain on the ground and white foam on her mouth.  Her eyes partly open with a glassy dead look, yet her skin warm to the touch.  A scream I will never forget came out of my mouth.  



It seemed like it took forever for the ambulance to arrive. I remember an EMT yelling, ""Her hearts not beating!"" I grabbed a random EMT and told them she took our methadone and promethazine.  In my heart I knew that she had overdosed.  My mind still clouded with drugs and alcohol from the night before.  My only thought was that she was young and had a strong heart.  I remember just thinking over and over that she would have a cool story to tell all her friends about the time she almost died.  I stood in our driveway and watched as they tried to resuscitate her.  Every time the paddles shocked her, her stomach heaved up and I thought it was a breath. 



The cops kept telling me to wait and calm down. I was calm though I was completely numb and refused to think she was dead.  I didn't shed a tear till the cops started whispering to each other.  Worried my dad was going to beat up Sean or me, he was coming back.  I sat on the sidewalk as it started to rain and sobbed, I knew she was dead before anyone told me.  My dad would have stayed at the hospital with her if she was okay. I sat outside numb and still high.  ""Someone needs to call mom...""  ""You do it, I can't tell anyone else.""  My dad handed me his phone as I stood up. Tears streaming down my face I dial the familiar number. ""Something horrible has happened...""

I've been clean for a couple weeks now and after coming off I've found that i'm in a lot of constant pain and find myself unable to get up or do anything and a lot of other nerve related issues, it turns out after going to a chiropractor and my GP that I have 2 Herniated Disks in my spine along with nerve damage throughout my body and potentially Fibro from what my GP is saying.

I had an mri a few years ago that said there might be some issues with my spine but they didn't bother to look into it, and now they're looking back on it and realizing that there was some severe herniation, they were surprised I could even walk, let alone stand. Well, continuing on.

After going to the doctor I was prescribed some Steroid medicine and some 5/325 Hydrocodones. My opiate tolerance is gone, but these hydrocodones are doing absolutely nothing, I'm scared that i'm going to hurt myself with the high NSAID intake. I'm supposed to take 6 a day and I got a script of 120. I have to take 8 just to get a sliver of relief and even then I'm still in pain enough to where it hurts so much I can barley get my self off of the couch. I've always had weird reactions to varying amounts of NSAID's, so this is a constant battle for me, I keep wanting to just take more because i'm still in such pain but i'm so worried about getting nsaid toxicity. 

Alright though, down to my actual question, is there anyway that I could speed up the process to maybe getting a stronger medication? I've got another mri later in the week and i'm not getting any relief from these hydrocodones what so ever. 

Is there anything I could say to my GP to push him to the conclusion that I need something stronger for this pain? and if any of you have the same condition as me which medication has given you the best relief?",1406224451.0

I took Tramadol before but as I am usually very careful with drugs I never did more than ~150mg at once (Me: male, 72kg). 

But the day before yesterday I took 300mg (liquid) with my gf who took about 160mg. That was in the evening and everything was quite nice. We felt very relaxed but talkative (somehow). Then when we went to bed I just couldn't sleep partly because of the itching that had already started. So I just lay there for like 8 hours, not able to fall asleep. However, that didn't even bother me much as I still felt very relaxed and peaceful.
Then the next day I had to go to Uni and felt just miserable. Not only was I incredibly tired because of the lack of sleep but I also felt pretty nauseaous. I puked once which made it a bit better but I still had the feeling to be completely hungover.

Called the connect, meet up at the spot, do the switch and I walk on. Get to the car and what the fuck? Quite literally what looks like chewed gum wrapped in foil. Fuck me. Now his phones been off and I'm feeling it. Ugh. Is there no standard anymore?9",1406342487.0

I'm attempting to stop lately so I've been down to doing it once every 2 daysish. Well on my way home I decide I want some so I text my normal guy and he says he's working his real job until 9:30 (WTF!?) and it was 5 at that point so I was fucking bummed. 
      When out of the blue this guy who has middle manned for me in the past calls me and says he actually has a bunch and is holding a bunch of buns. So I think yippee my lucky day I'll be getting some. I take out 240 because I originally planned on getting 4 through the guy who ended up being at work. So I go down there planning on buying 3 for 180. 
       This guy sketches me out because he just walks around a mall all day buying perfume off the super clearance section and selling it back to Mexicans who don't know any better, he shoots up(no offense to people who do) and he has no cellphone or job. I don't think he even has a home/roof over his head. 
       So he hops in my car and says oh well I caught a juxt on some dudes so I got a bunch of bundles and some crack if you want that too(I have never done crack and never will but I've done soft) so he says oh well I need $350 by tomorrow for a studio apartment because my wife is pregnant and can't be on the streets so I'll do them for 45 a bun if you get all 8. That comes out to $360. I'm like nah bro I don't got the bread just give me 3 for $180. Then he says well how about $250 for all 8 and I say bro all I got $240 but if you'll take that I'll do it so he agrees. I bust out 2 bags before I buy them to test out make sure it taste right and all that. 
        Like I said he sketches me out but he's never beat me although when he middles he'll take out 2-3 bags when I get say 1.5 buns which is a steep charge but whatever and he always says he'll get me back one day. I guess today was that day he got me back.      These are the UCONN stamp bags. I ended up doing like 14 bags over 30 min and got a nod so it's average quality shit. Definitely was a steal in my eyes...literally for him. I was very sketched out since it seemed too good to be true but I think he's just a dope field/crackhead. I had a cop behind me at one point and though fuck he got pinched and now the cops had him sell to me to reduce sentence and now my life is over. I ended up turning down a road to see if he was following me and he wasn't and when he kept going so I rejoiced. The bags are kinda skimp but I don't give a fuck. It's 8 bundles for $240 which is a deal around my parts. By the way this is actually all a day dream I had last night ;-) you feel me? So I think this would qualify as a LEGIT Junkie Jesus story. What do y'all think?

TL;DR A junkie/fiend who middles for me sometimes robbed someone and I profited.

Only moments later we had insane crack fueled sex in the middle of a parking lot. I shot you up with dope for your first time right after I came. 

Crazy how conditioned you were to associating the feeling of IV dope with me. And how conditioned I was to having that high. That high that comes with having that hold over somebody.

I was digging you too, the way you would look around after a hit of crack and grin, the way you always had a toothbrush and mouth wash for after the first-hit-projectile-vomit-effect. I remember having sex on your friends nasty bathroom floor and we both realized that neither of us were even enjoying it. So we laughed, shot up more and just laid there cuddling, scratching each others backs and nodding out on each other.

I could tell you were a little down on your health but you were so beautiful despite that. You never lost that look in your eye.
Maybe you don't have that look now , maybe you look as dead as I looked. It saddens me to picture your emerald eyes with nobody behind them.

Even though from most people's perspective all we had was ""junkie love"" I will never forget you, or the incredible, soul touching times we had, I just need too try to remember the dark ones more too. ",1406333856.0

So last night I'm getting ready to go out to a street fest and see some friends play. I've got a loaded rig in my purse and thats all. I have to go pick up but I'll do it on my way home. I'm starting to feel a little off but i push through it and say to myself one more hour.... so two hours later I'm really wanting that hit. the beer isn't doing much for me yet. so i go into an alley and pull that loaded rig outta my purse and this is the first time this has ever happened to me: the plunger is missing. THE GODDAMN PLUNGER CAME OUT. i lost 2/3 of that hit. I'm flipping balls. and thats when i notice the security dude staring right at me. lucky for me he didn't see the rig. he leaves and i stick the plunger in and save that 1/3 and decide not to do it cuz i won't feel shit so i just stick it back in my purse. at this point I'm a sweaty wreck so i start calling/texting my ex to know if he's bak yet. no service. great he's in the metro. so i go take the metro and right as the doors close he finally answers and says he's on a different line at the station. fuck. get off on the next station, go back to the one i was just at, and switch lines. finally get there and he's waiting.

but now he's pissed i went out without him. he wants to go to the fest with me. I'm like fuck no. i don't want none of that bullshit. he gets super clingy and doesn't want me talking to anyone else all night but him. so of course I'm like fuck no i didn't tell you i was going cuz i wanted to go by myself. so now he's screaming in my fuckin face and won't give me my dope when all i want is to take it and go. so for half a fucking hour he's FOLLOWING ME. and I'm like dude back the fuck up.and he keeps trying to grab me and shit. so finally i flip out and make a grab for my dope. at some point i finally get it in my hands but he's still goddamn following me. i put my headphones on cuz I'm tired of listening to him bitch about the same thing over and over. he's getting really pissed and he goes to grab the earphone out but i think he's about to hit me so i hit first and i just sorta push his face away and then the motherfucker hits me. hard. i can feel my ears ringing. and after all that he's STILL trying to follow me!

great now he's in the metro but he's standing right next to where i want to go to head bak downtown. so i wait until he finally goes downstairs. i hide out on the stairs where he can't see me until the metro comes. i wait right til the doors close to run in so if he does see me its too late. luckily he doesn't see me and he's still waiting on the tracks.

get back, missed the entire show, but do go to the after party. do a nice hit in a bus booth and as I'm preparing my hit a cop car drives by. great. lucky me he didn't see and keeps going. i continue on. the one good thing about tonight: not missing my hit. i go to the party and get drunk. great now two guys are fighting over me and i don't know what to do cuz i really don't care. like i just wanted to have a good time after a shitty night, please don't do this to me right now. my ex from like years (diff dude) past keeps staring at me all goddamn night its uncomfortable.

at some point i go to mcdonalds and get a nice mcbreakfast and take a taxi home. i have to go in to get money. fucking guy tries to come inside my house and he's being all loud and shit. like dude if you wake my parents up they won't want to pay you. so i give him my wallet to get him to shut the fuck up and get in the car.

and now i wake up today and realize I CUT OFF MY ONLY DOPE CONNECT. A WEEK AND A HALF EARLY. GODDAMIT.

while it feels good to finally get away from his crazy psycho-ness I've totally fucked myself over. i have court on tuesday that i can't be sick for. god how i wish suboxone induction was this tuesday instead of next. so I'm going to spend the rest of the day scrambling to find a connect.

god what a shitty week. and now my dads threatening that if he finds out i do drugs then he's going to take away my computer and phone. i really don't need all this bullshit right now. I'm trying hard but there's a limit as to how many shitty things can happen to me before i flip out and do a big fat hit.

TL; DR: prepped rig in purse, plunger comes out, lose hit, chaos ensues. ex bf flips out and hits me and tries to follow me to party. guys at party compete for me and i end up in the middle of the bullshit. take a taxi home and guy is so loud he wants to follow me in my house while i get my money and wake everyone up (i live with my parents). today i wake up and realize i cut off my only dope connect. parents are now threatening to take away computer and phone. my life is stupid.",1406320128.0

Day 1: Last dose (.2g) IV H at 8AM, Withdrawaling by 8PM

Day 2: Agony. Misery. Muscle aches and RLS x 1000

Day 3: CT Continues, plateaus. Attempt Phenibut. Regret. Made the RLS even worse and drove me to the point of near breaking down and seeking ER. I felt drowsy but couldn't sit still for even 1 second. Excruciating pain.

Day 4: Plateau wavers from peak to nearly peak. No sleep besides brief passing out from the pain and writhing about in bed.

Day 5: Some signs of improvement, but then hourly wavering back to peak of all traditional symptoms. The muscle pain is unbearable. Procure 48mg of Lope. 1PM take 12mg LOPE | 2PM take 8mg of LOPE | 4PM Muscle aches significantly reduced! RLS reduced as well. Both about 75% (First time and very impressed). I wasn't sure how much to take being that you hear everything from traditional doses to triple-digits. I feel a bit dizzy and nauseous, like I could have sufficed with 12mg to 14mg of Lope. Live and learn.

Summary: Phenibut was a huge mistake in full CT. Somehow made my already maximum agony go up one more notch on the misery-meter. I was literally writhing and passing in/out of consciousness from the pain. I was willing to try anything and I regretted it considerably. The Lope did the most help but we'll see if the constipation is terrible. I'm prone to it so I have some softeners, mag sulfate, and glycerin.",1406319226.0

The dope rush come on, then the crack rush, but it's smoothed out and I feel like I get ringers more often when I do it after a shot. I don't smoke hard unless I have dope, don't like it on its own.


What do you smoke with, btw, and do you have a certain technique for hitting the pipe? I use a standard love rose and bit of chore with the coating burnt off. I hit it pointing straight up while turning the pipe slowly, drawing the flame toward the end of the pipe, watching the tube to see how much vapor I'm getting, and inhaling faster/slower depending on the amount of vapor, I don't torch it because it wastes some rock and the hit is harsher. When I want to take a blast after my shot, I'll met a big hit in there beforehand so I can just pick up the pipe and hit it without having to hold it up so the rocks don't fall out.


I've never injected it, but if I was gonna do a speedball, I'd buy hard instead of soft, because soft is much more expensive and not very good where I'm from. All the hard I've bought has at least been decent, the worst rock I've got has maybe been 5/10, while the coke can be like 2/10.",1406316436.0

The hydrocodone has not been helping me what so ever, I actually had a flare up yesterday that required me to go to the hospital, I was unable to lift my right arm up higher than my chest and had constant shooting pains.

After being admitted to the ER, a quick look over they came to the conclusion of cervicul radiculopathy caused by the herniated disk/s. They asked about my meds and I told them that i've been taking hydrocodone 5/325s and the steroids and they immediately left and came back with 3 IM shots.

They gave me TORADOL (concentrated ibuprofen NSAID)
NORFLEX - Skeletal muscle relaxant
and HYDROmorphone (dilaudid)

I got each of the shots in my hip. After about 20 minutes I had noticeable improvements in my range and pain. My pain wasn't completely gone, but it was taken care of enough to where I felt normal again, like I didn't have any restrictions and could actually stand up on my feet without going into immense pain.

The dilaudid literally saved me last night, I talked to the nurse and doctor in ER about how in comparison to the norcos I was taking it actually had noticeable improvements. I've been taking the maximum amount of norcos I can without killing myself with tylenol and I have no relief what so ever. They recommended I talk to my physician about the lack of relief from the hydrocodone and the risk of toxicity from APAP and ask about getting dilaudid since from the judgement of the faculty at the hospital, they deemed it would be the best treatment option for what I was experiencing. 

My doctor is currently going over my reports from the ER visit and looking at the xrays they did and his receptionist said she would call me if he felt like he should see me today.

My goal here is to try and see if I could get my doctor to prescribe the Dilaudid to me without me having to push it or make it a point, I'm trying as hard as I can to not make it seem like I'm just looking for a high, I'm seriously in pain and have been nothing but honest with my doctor, but with my previous experienced with doctors, my outlook seems bleak, but I haven't written him off yet.

I was 17, I had been using dope for a little over half a year and I was fucking great at it. My best friend and I are in it together and we had everybody fooled. The thought that we could have been using drugs would never have even crossed the minds of our friends or parents. Our lives were a fucking adventure but we were extremely careful we were fully aware of what we were doing and we knew it couldn't last forever. 

Fast forward a few months my birthday has passed and my friend and I are now using rigs. Once again we're extremely careful and safe about everything. None of our close ones have even a clue of what's going on. So now I'm going to school and I'm about to land a 40k job as a manager at the place where both my friend and I work. Basically I'm on my way out into the world. Oh and also throughout those few months I started working out and lost a shit ton of weight, finally lost my virginity, and was seeing a few girls. Needless to say I was in a good fucking place. 

So now I run through the events of this day all the time and I still don't know how it happened. I had the day off and I had a couple of bags saved over from yesterday so I was going to have a good fucking time. Grabbed all my shit went to the bathroom and had a nice shot, got it the first time for once. I go back to my room, start playing some Vidya and nod off. I awoke to my dad screaming at me asking what the needle in the bathroom was for, I left the motherfucking rig on the counter what the fuck is wrong with me!  

Two days after that I was in rehab, stayed their for a week. When I got home my room was completely different, all of my shit was missing. I had no car and no phone and no connection to the internet. My parents called my job and told them I was quitting and when I finally got on the internet my friends wouldn't talk to me because my parents paid them all a visit and told them what was up and they did the same to my friend everyone he was close with because somehow my mom got into my Facebook and twitter and read all my messages. 

So yah my life was completely destroyed, I was going to kill myself and got real close to it but in the end I decided to go into the military to start over again. I leave August 26th for bct. 

I'd love to hear anybody stories on how they got caught!

TL;DR
Got caught, parents fucked my life up. ",1406476256.0

So I'm stopping...fingers crossed anyway.

Any ideas on how bad I can expect the withdrawal to be? First time going through WD btw if that makes a difference.

I'm just trying to work out whether it will be minor enough to completely cold turkey it - or if I should get some clonidine/benzos/lope etc and prepare for a bad time.

I'm also getting some Nitrous to fuck around with while I'm high. I wanna be blasted all day. I'm going to use Benadryl, Tagamet, and Promethazine to potentiate like I normally do.

Throwaway here and some background information, I have a physically debilitating disability that causes extreme pain, basically my spine is collapsing on itself and it's awful.  I'm in a wheelchair and there's a bunch of other crap going on and it sucks.  Yeah...

I was sent to a pain specialist who has given me a baseline of Methadone every day along with Oxy's for breakthrough pain management...but it's not been working for sharp, burning and other forms of pain.  Here's the thing though, before the pain specialist I was on Vicodin 10/325's which helped more than my current regiment but since switching I can't stop sleeping, there's constant nightmares,  depression from pain, I'm constantly tired, can barely stay awake past 9:30 at night, my job is suffering because I can't be comfortable,  and what sucks the fuckin most is that warm comfort from the Vicodin is gone which was really helpful in getting over my awful pain even if the painkiller part wasn't working.  That comfort helped me live, now I'm basically a shut in.  After some research it looks like Methadone knocks out that comfort that helps me with pain when painkillers aren't always kicking the pain away, and I'm just stuck with Methadone which feels like it is screwing with me really bad.  

**My question**: from anyone's experience, is there any possibilities of getting that comfort back from Oxy's while taking the Methadone or is it completely gone?  I'm uncomfortable so much I just don't know what to do between a single twenty minute appointment monthly and getting nowhere.  I want that comfort back but would Vicodin on top of my Methadone do anything?  Are there any tricks like spacing out medications or taking something with it?  I just took a concoction of Oxy's and Methadone an hour ago and I'm still hurting...Does anyone have any advice or ideas?  I'm getting my ass kicked here.

There of course is not a relatable pins and needles Dilaudid/Morphine effect, but there is a verrrrry pleasant and drawn out rush.  Definitely feels like the tail end buzz of a dope hit or OC hit

I consider the rush like how OP 80s are if you crisped them (havent in years), but does anyone else enjoy a nice shot like this?  If I take another shot of the same size tonight I will guaranteed nod and this is after 4 years of Sub maintenance

PS - Also, etiz+sub in the same shot is better than dope, period.  You get the most intense body rush of tingles and sedation and then you wake up an hour later asking yourself what happened.  Anyone tried that before?  Very easy to prep if not in solution form and very easy with powder, pills would be a thick shot.  I prefer 20-30 mg tiz and 12 mg sub for a gutpunch

Part One,"So, as many of you know, back in April I had had enough and was trying to quit my 1.5g per day IV heroin addiction.



I was still in a good place physically; I worked full time and had the master bedroom in an older but nice home. I juggled work, addiction, hustling,  and being a proud ""mother"" to my two pet rats.




My roommates were all over the age of 45 and behaved like high school girls, especially one in particular whose sole purpose seemed to be feeding the landlord bullshit about the other tenants. I was at the end of my rope with their theatrics, and then, when I thought my living situation couldn't be less ideal, my landlord and his shemale (no offense intended) partner, as well as another guy who turned out to be the homeowner and their two dogs (along with truckloads of their shit) started squatting in the house, taking up all the free space downstairs,  and made up bogus stories to get me legally evicted so that they could get their grimy mitts on my room. At that time, I was using meth and heroin heavily while building up my collection of detox meds.



It was around thus time my ex asked me for a place to live while he got back on his feet. I've always loved him unconditionally,  so I emptied ny bank account and bought him a train ticket, paid first months rent on a room in a home an hour and a half away from my previous city of residence, and set him up with everything he could have ever needed. 



He had come to me from fresh out of a rehab, where he'd relapsed 3 times and was set to be kicked out. The first thing he wanted when he stepped off the train was a shot. I had wanted to taper down quickly and get off the shit so that we would have a chance at a good, healthy relationship this time around. But with his insistence to get high and me being already strung out, we spiralled pretty quickly. He refused to put any effort into the relationship,  laying at home all day bitching about wanting dope and how long he always had to wait for me to get off work, cop dope and bring it home to him.


After a month of me busting my ads to support us both entirely, I was unable to cover the costs of continuing to live there, and so, desperate,  I called my aunt and uncle to see if they'd let us stay until we saved enough for our own place. Out of the kindness of their heart, they let my boy, who was a stranger to them,  and me, their drug addicted niece,  live under their roof, with the agreement being we maintained jobs, stayed clean, and helped with chores. 


We cut back on our use by about 75%. In the month we were there we git high maybe 8 times and maintained with Lope the rest of the time,  whereas before we were loaded 24-7.



That sounds great, good for you, you might say. But that was just part one.


Up next in part 2.... my boyfriend robs my family and I,  incarceration, domestic assault,  prostitution,  abandonment,  and a tiny beacon of hope.

On a throwaway account because I am ashamed of my opiate use. Anyways. I've been addicted to PST for the past 9 months. Money ran out about 3 months ago and have been shoplifting daily from various european markets in my area that held a lot of unwashed seeds. They eventually do what all grocery stores do when something is shoplifted frequently.. They get rid of it.

So my source has dried up and I got desperate. Living in Chicago you'd think that I'd just go pick up some H (I've heard it's an amazing place for this) But I wouldn't even know who to talk to. Anyways, back to the point at hand. Loperamide. I don't know why this gets so much ""it doesn't cross the blood brain barrier you retard, what you are feeling is a placebo"" Because clearly, in high dosages, small amounts DEFINATELY cross the BBB. At least they cross mine, my ex girlfriends, my best friends, my new ladyfriends, and my sisters BBB. 

I have no opiate experience outside of morphine/codeine/thebaine. But I get high from taking a 150mg Zantac, then an hour later 100mg of Loperamide washed down with 500ml~ of white grapefruit juice. With a tolerance built up over 9 months of PST use. This high is strong, VERY long lasting, and stronger than the pst I've been making for the past 4 or 5 months. and I had a heavy (2.5lbs daily) habit. 

Yes, the volume of pills is heavy. Personally taking 50, while others with no tolerance took 12.5, then 12.5 2 hours after minimal high was acheived to boost it up. They all nodded. I get pinpoint eyes(which I don't from PST) amazing deep breaths, a weaker than average but still present mental high, and amazing amounts of energy and a lust for life I haven't had since I was diagnosed with PTSD 5 years ago. 

This clearly works. Even on two people who had 0 idea what to expect(my best friend and new ladyfriend.) They hadn't done opiates before. But both displayed signs of being high on opiates. (Physical signs such as: pinpoint, nodding, slight respiratory depression)

Now for the question I know you're all think. ""Damn brah, how did you shit the next month?"" While high, unless taken with any stool softener, nobody shit. One person did not shit for 3 days, because of the refusal of stool softener, and the rest shit a day after their dose. I take my dose daily and shit daily/every other day when I take stool softener/drink some OJ.

My message: I am not saying  GO RAID THE DOLLAR STORE AND SWALLOW THE LOPE! SNORT THE LOPE! PLUG THE LOPE! IV THE LOPE! No. I am saying the next time you a desperate for a high, you are broke, or you just want to try out a new high, try it out. You have nothing to lose but a shit for a day. And anybody who says they are getting high from this is not some lunatic or someone getting a ""placebo"" effect. It is real. I am not sure if there are just some people who just CANT get high from it or what....but so far every person who has taken it that I know has been very impressed. 

Tl;dr Lope is a miracle drug for anybody who doesn't want to go into withdrawals. I have tested it. It must cross the BBB. Believe it or not. ",1406570245.0

It's my fault he took me off it, I suggested it could have caused the seizure although I wasn't on it at the time mainly because I was hoping to be switched to hydrocodone, but instead I got nothing.

Anyways, I have to call them because they put me on the patented cholesterol medication that doesn't have a generic yet. I am simply not gonna pay for name brand statins when simvastatin has been on the market for decades now. So I was thinking about mentioning that I was struggling with headache pain without the tramadol script. Do you think he can call it in over the phone? My family doc practices pretty far from my college town. The main problem is that tramadol is schedule 5 or 6 in my state so I dunno if he will be able tocall it in. Anyone have experience calling their doc for lower scheduled drugs? I could go to the health center and ask for it, but he is the doc that I originally saw for seizure so he had already told me not to take tramadol anymore. He prescribed me 12 butalbital (a barbiturate with caffeine) which were novel and interesting, but I'm not interested unless it's the kind with codeine added ;)

Meh I know I should just call an try it but I get such bad anxiety and I def don't wanna be labeled a drug seeker and never get anything good in the future. My doc has been overprescribing my family painkillers for years though! He gave my mother 30 10 mg lortabs monthly for the same condition (chronic headaches).

1. After going out while sick to score I used in a taco bell bathroom and then went back to my apartment, I walked in my front door and took out the change from my pocket which was just a quarter. I threw the quarter like a frisbee into my kitchen, it bounced off the wall and then ricocheted onto the ceiling fan which was on low speed and then slowly slipped off the ceiling fan falling onto the dining room table below it and bounced off of the wood twice and then landed in a cup of water sitting on the table.        Seeing this happen while high as hell was truly a sight, I was speechless, just trying to process what had happened in my mind, pretty sure I looked like this. 
https://0-media-cdn.foolz.us/ffuuka/board/wsg/image/1399/68/1399685660566.gif

2: I was sitting in my living room with a few of my buddies we were all dosing, my buddies were shooting up, I just did a fat line, sat back and we got done and started tossing cards into a (brutal slam death metal) hat that was on the floor, well we each grabbed one and threw each of them one at a time, I threw mine and it was too hard of a throw, and it swooshed past the hat and then literally slid through the window sill, that had about a space the thickness of a quarter between the window and the frame. It went straight through and then proceeded to fall to the ground outside. I looked at my buddies like http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l8tnws6gNC1qccthy.png

I would like to use heroin but my mother force-feeds me suboxone and makes me sit with her until it dissolves. Now, if I were to swallow the strip after scraping it off my tongue with my teeth right when I ""take"" it, will any bupe have been absorbed? Would I be able to get a decent nod?

However, my therapist told my psychiatrist about my (now past) use and he refuses to see me unless I pass a (blood) drug test.

I haven't used oxycodone in about a five weeks+; an 80 about once or twice a week was what used to set me good (OP if it matters). I used hydros about two weeks ago, my last dose was 30mg of 10/325. I haven't used any opiates since (save about 40-100mg of codeine a week ago and 8mg of oxymorphone about a month ago I just remembered, but idk if they're testing for that). I last smoked around that time ago (but smoking is pretty common where I am so I don't really take note of when I do or don't smoke, it's just kind of part of the culture where I'm from).

I never was a full blown addict, I'd use because my therapist and psychiatrist would refuse to treat my severe can't-leave-the-house social anxiety.

So my question to you, reddit, will I pass the drug test? I have really bad ADHD and I honestly can't function without the medication that my psychiatrist prescribes. I can't wait to get off opiates and onto proper treatment for my anxiety as it holds me back in life and I honestly don't enjoy opiates that much (sorry guys). Thank you, this is very important to me.

So I recently moved to DE from NY am in need of a new pain management doctor. I've had multiple back surgeries and my previous doctor in NY is just too far to keep going to. My dose for the past few years has been 6 30mg roxicodone per day for breakthrough and 100mcg patches for ER. I have all of the documentation, X-rays, reports, etc. from my former dr.

Anyway, the problem I've been experiencing has been finding a doctor who will write for the same amounts I've been on for years! Granted, I've only visited two different doctors so far, but they said that it's very unusual to write for anything over 2 of the roxicodone per day, yet they have no issue with my patches. When I posted this over in r/delaware, someone commented that DE has a huge problem with rx abuse, so I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.

Is this a statewide policy? I'm going to do more research, but this seems like a very insightful community so I figured it couldn't hurt to ask. If anyone has any recommendations for pain management facilities, that would be great!

I go to pick up my buddy because he needed a ride somewhere.  He walked to a local quik-e Mart and I picked him up there.  He used to sell A LOT of weed but he's straight now.  We both have nothing on us.  He hops in car, and we pull out and immediately a cop starts following us.  

I'm driving my girlfriends car and everything is legit on it.  Cop keeps following and as I'm about 100 feet from leaving his jurisdiction, he lights us up.  Shit.  I have a suspended license and on felony probation. I'm fucked so I pull over.  

They go right to the passenger window where he's sitting and address him by name.  It's the same cop that had tried to arrest him 2 weeks ago for a warrant that had been taken care of a month prior.  (I witnessed them trying to take him in, even though he had papers saying that the warrant was dropped.  It wasn't until a superior came and told the dick cop to let him go.)  

They pull him out of the car while 3 more cars come.  I'm shitting bricks knowing I have a probation violation just waiting to happen for the license.   They finally take me out of the car and ask for ID and I give them an ID card and not a license.   So now they know I don't have a license.  

I'm told to sit on the curb and they separate us to see if  the stories match.  They do of course and then they ask to search the car.   Now I know my gf's car is clean as a whistle but I'm hesitant at first and say it's not my car and wouldn't be comfortable with you searching it without her permission.  At this point they already ran my ID and know I'm on probation so they ask me again or they'll call my PO and search it anyway and have the car towed.  I can't have my gf's car towed.  By this time both of us have been physically searched.

So I ask them the reason they pulled me over and they say ""suspicious activity. Your friend here hopped out of a car and right into yours.  Looks like a drug deal to me"".  So I then said ""ok I'll let you search if you can do my a solid and just let my gf pick up the car and not give me the suspended license violation.""   They respond saying we won't tow the car.   Whatever. I know it's clean and give them permission.

  They tear threw it and find nothing.  Then to my utmost surprise they say"" your ID is on the seat, have your girlfriend come down and get the car.. if it's here in an hour it'll be towed.  Have a nice evening""    

UH WHAAAAAT?!?!   So holy fuck. . No ticket.  No probation violation.  No nothing.  So we waited 20 minutes and then just took off because they was no way my gf was gonna walk 3 miles to get the car.  

Do you guys think the stop was bullshit so that's why they let it go?  I personally think it's because they are harassing my friend and now they are 0-2 on trying to pop him.  I'm so thankful now that I'm home and such, but it just seems so odd that I'd like opinions on it.

This is a rant. Responses greatly appreciated.,"I am a daily user, been binging for like 4 mos now, mostly hydro (oxy/dilaud when I could get any). Can't seem to stop the daily use man. Always promise myself I'll lay off for at least a day...and never do.

Filled my usual #30 10/325 Norcs 2 days ago. Now have ten left. Usually they'd be gone by today (tolerance is about 90 to 100mg hydro a day, or 70 to 95mg oxy). No refills this time. 

I have a big re-dose problem, i.e. I love to re-dose hydro - 50 to 60mg in AM, then 30 or 40mg PM - which I feel like 90% of the time is kinda a waste (only get a small 'glow' with the re dose, although it does last a couple hours). 

Took 60mg hydro + 5mg flexeril + 4mg chlor-tri 5 hours ago, buzz is slowly but surely draining. Really, really want to re-dose with 40mg hydro tonight soon. 

Then I'd only have 60mg hydro left total for tomorrow. Which, even with substantial potentiators (I have some Valium 10mgs, plus whatever else is OTC and what I said above as well) will just barely get me through a couple hours. Then Id be out. As in NO MORE OPIATES. 

I'm so TIRED. I've 'shopped' enough recently these last couple months for it to be sketch to go out and do it again (worried about the pharm flagging, etc.). No reliable hooks for anything where I live, sometimes can find 15mg roxi / 10mg percs, but it's SO damn inconsistent with that dude. Plus I hate waiting. 

I guess I'm gonna stop. I don't WANT to, but I NEED to. Don't want to delve into my personal life, but I've always been somewhat of a non functional user. 

For W/Ds, I have: Lomotil, Valium, and Neurontin. Could possibly get a lot more benzos scripted, but I used to have a REAL problem with sedatives, and my whole GABA system is wired wrong now*. 

Just thinking about not using opiates anymore is depressing. But the binging and daily use is in and of itself depressing me. I guess it's just that time again y'all. For me to get a fucking life again and learn how to feel ok without pills. To think that 5 months ago I was clean and somewhat ok personally is so weird as of today man.
