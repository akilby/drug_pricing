I’ve had the shittiest luck lately.

I was real dopesick exactly  2 weeks ago and right after I scored, I totaled my car on the icy expressway. Still was sick when I crashed, and I panicked and threw all the dope away. Of course the cop that showed up was cool as fuck too and would not have tried to search me. Just my luck.

Well my cousin’s been driving me to cop lately and today he picked me up while I was super sick. I get these weird stomach movements when I’m sick where I’ll throw up stomach acid. These urges are impossible to fight like I can with normal puking sometimes.

Of course I didn’t wanna throw up in his car, so I went out the window. First time I went out and all the stomach acid just went straight to the back window -_-
Second time, my glasses flew off in the wind onto the highway.

I guess it’s not even as much bad luck as me just being a dumbass. My glasses have been loose and fucked up lately and missing one of the nose pieces, but I figured I’d put off getting them fixed as long as I needed to. Looks like I’ll just have to get a new pair now. Lol. Fuck.

And the worst part of this all (of course my junkie mindset tells me this is the “worst”...)
is that the real strong dope in my area is gone. And the dealer is lying and saying he has it even though his stuff sucks now.

Do any of your dealers have the habit of bitching at you and being an asshole? This dude is the biggest asshole of a dealer that I know. But he has the best stuff...
I don’t even say anything besides how much and ask him where to go. Still gets super pissed...",1518884495.0

I usually always just try to stick to a dose that I know works as to not have shit days like Wednesday lol but I’d like to go back to a little lower tolerance (I know even 30mg isn’t a high tolerance at all)as 30s are hard to come by and are really expensive in small town.

I am afraid the temptation to bang one just to see what it's like is becoming more irresistible. 

so... on the off chance that i do decide to do it, can i get some tips regarding dosage / anything else you think might be important. i will google how to prep but i want to get some first hand suggestions from you guys as to dosage for a first timer with low tolerance. 

i have been using seeds for the past couple of years fairly irregularly so i have not developed much of a tolerance at all. 10-20mg of oxy typically gets me to where i wanna be with the ones i have at the moment. 

i have 10mg instant release capsules. how much of one of these should i use?

i have done my research on the addictive side of IV so if you want to warn me just know that it might be a waste of energy. i really just want to make sure that if i do do it that i don't take too much and have a bad time or die. but on the other hand if you feel strongly about trying to persuade me not to do it well go for it i won't mind.

one reason that i am fairly confident that i will be able to control my use is that i do not have access to more pills once these ones run out. it's very hard to come by without a prescription around here and i do not have friends who fuck with this shit

thanks guys much peace and happiness to all

its clear now that i am a lifer of opiates, after having tried quitting suboxone after being on it for thirteen years, 9 years straight.

I brought my dose down to 1/64th of an 8mg tablet.

7 days later the withdrawal and pain oonly got more intense.


Around this time my TMJ continued to get worse and worse and worse.

So at this time i am most likely going to make the switch from suboxone back to a regular ass opiate that actually kills pain. Suboxones pain killing effect is more along the lines of masking the pain not actually getting rid of it. It does an awful job at it. For very minor things, yes, Suboxone acts like the motrin of Opioids, and same to the intolerant, its proably grandiose. I digress: ITS NOT USED FOR PAIN.


I ahve been in pain for 6 years straight. I have tried countless meds, and therapies. Opioid treatment , something id never thought id be doing, is my last option. 


On a daily basis i feel like my head is being crushed to sum it up. I have extreme jaw pain that radiates into my inner ear canal and through both my upper and lower jaw as well as their teeth, causing my teeth to crumble.

I have not seen my primary doctor but 2 time as i am kind-of afraid of both doctors, and doctors dismissingme because i am on suboxone. I have had this happen before and it makes me want to cry because you feel helpless. Most doctors do not even care, once they realize that you take Suboxone. One even told me this outright.


TL;DR



**What is the best opiate for jaw/facial pain**

**wat is the best opiate combination for jaw/facial pain i.e. if it comes with tylenol, motrin, or something else like naloxone (which in the right proportions actually INCREASES the efficacy of the drug,.**


**...i dunno what to do anymore**


suicide & death have been on my mind a lot because i am in constant pain. 

i love my life and i am a very positive person but i cannot take the pain. 


i would love to me admitted to the emergency room , to have a stay over night so they can properly address my meds & help me with my pain  , but i do not know if this is even possible.

I'm considering trying it but I'm also worried about the obvious addiction risks. Basically - **How good is Oxycodone?** Is it like heroin - when you do it and you *know* this is the best feeling you will ever experience in your life? Will I be like ""wow, life is boring now""? Or is a one-time use not that bad?

How addictive is it - from one time, assuming I have access to more pills, will I get physical cravings?

I hope this isn't pissing anyone off - I know opiate addiction is not something to fuck around with and I'm not here to offend anyone. I'm just really fucking interested and at the same time I'm very prone to addiction so I'm hesitant.

7y5zhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7y5zhs/wowsnorting_tar_is_strong/,10,https://redd.it/7y5zhs,Wowziersgray,Wow...snorting tar is STRONG,"Honestly, I’ve always thought that tar was a waste of money even though it’s half the price per gram as ECP (moved from east to west).  However, I recently mixed my tar with glutamine powder with a ratio of 1:1 and GOD DAMN GOD DAMN, it’s beyond surprisingly strong.

I’ll link a pic later of the lines I was doing and what it looked like, color wise.  

But yeah, I mean tar is $80-100 a gram for the good stuff where I’m at, and I bought 3 grams for $220. I have no tolerance as I haven’t partook in 7 months.  Smoking it, as I had remembered, took around a point to produce some good hits and a discernable high.  However, I did the pill bottle penny technique using a point of the tar resulting in 200mg of 50/50 greyish heroin.  I racked up a small, 30-40mg line, and within 5 minutes I was buzzing hard.  And the high lasted twice as long as when smoking.

Yeah, it stung a bit but, really, nothing too bad.

Now I love tar! It’s so freaking cheap!  Again, I got 3g for $220 and using the 50/50 cutting, it produces 6 grams of really heavy hitting snortable heroin!

It’s still tar, so it’s still less of that euphoric and energizing high that I got from ECP, but it’s a fraction of the cost and has longer legs.

Anyway - the reason for this post - has anyone else had this experience?? That when snorted, tar is crazy strong and even cut, is just as potent by weight as good afghan powder?!

My only guess as to why is that Mexican tar is rarely cut heavily due to it’s strange texture and is typically more “pure” in terms of percentage of general opiates because it contains like three or four more things than just heroin (diacetylmorphine).",1518863923.0

Relationship background;
-2 year duration
- Lived together for 1 year so far
- Heroin addicts
-Happy couple until recently

Story;
  This all went downhill the other day when a man was basically cussing us out because we parked on his side of the street. Because we were carrying, I did whatever I could to leave ASAP. ""I called the cops and gave them your plate number. Don't park in front of my house!"" My girlfriend, barks back and he calls her a bitch. I tell her to get in the car to leave the situation NOW.
  Apparently, I'm a pussy because I didn't get out of the car and engage in this dude's drama. Sure, I understand her point, but my pride isn't worth a felony, because we had dope on us. This is followed by hours of arguing, which is not usual for us. Eventually, it gets heated to the point to where I snapped, out of character, and snapped her phone. Immediately, I regretted it. 
   So now, I'm in the doghouse still 3 days later. Today started out rough. I haven't been overly apologetic, but I did tell her I was sorry and that it would never happen again, which I meant. She thinks I've done a bunch a dope without her (not true) which makes me a selfish boyfriend. I replaced her phone. Also, she was dopesick while brutally ripping me.
  This evening she finally lightened up a little bit. I bought some dope and copped some cash which seemed to put her back to her normal self, somewhat. ""Babe"" calling was coming back, a couple kisses.....but she has still lemme know she hasn't forgot. Basically what I'm asking is, does it sound like I may have a chance?

The snot is flowing now, a thousand floodgates cranked open. Bearded men with wooden leg prostheses roaring through the tempest of crashing mucoid waves, Melvillian characters stoically braving the storms of early withdrawal. Chills, sweats, restless legs – it’s all par for the course and you really shoulda learned last time God damn it. In this numb nuts’ mind, the term “dopesick” never did it justice. It’s more than a mere flu spin-off, it is concentrated despair, waking up to bells tolling gloomily in the distance, it is you scrounging for all the obtainable firstborns in ripe sacrificial age to propitiate the dope gods.

Our quote unqote hero whips through the masses with the verve of an overzealous conquistador in a New World jungle.

On a nearby corner, he spots his dealer and can you believe it this pathetic worm actually does that thing when you see someone you really like at a distance and automatically start smiling awkwardly and start focusing your vision on the floor or a point behind him not daring to fully commit to meeting the other guy’s gaze until the final moment right before the hands shake.


Like ripping off a band-aid, the idiot leaves with dope in hand. Now to go home.

I took the last of my oxycodone (25mg IR) that I had (ate half, insufflated rest) this evening. I railed a few lines (15mg) at 10pm, then vaped a little weed. Then popped a cetirizine, a hydroxyzine, and chewed up the last oxy I had (10mg) about 30 minutes ago, around 11:30. Not feeling much of anything. 

I injured my shoulder at work (strained my trapezius) and the doctor wrote for Skelaxin (insurance won’t cover it) and to my surprise, 50mg Tramadol (wasn’t my normal doctor.) I’ve read conflicting reports that it is a rather weak opioid. Guess my question is could I use it to potentiate the dose(25mg) I’ve already taken tonight? 
I know exceeding 400mg or something causes seizures. I’d only do one or two 50mg pill (if this is even worthwhile). Might just save them. I only have 15 I think,no refills, and a consult for physical therapy.

Just wanted some opinions. Happy safe nods to those of you feelin good.

But in the past couple weeks due to incredible stress my daily dose had risen to like twice what it should be. So I am now on day 2 of cutting my daily dose in half. IV heroin user here btw.

I've kicked cold turkey for days many times so I know this is no where near what the suffering *could* be. But, as anyone who's tried a taper knows, when you decrease your dose by a huge percentage, you definitely friggin feel it.

And the mindfuck element is so brutal. Having more sitting right there, that I'm saving for the rest of this taper... bags of freshies, sterile saline, shit to do...

The biggest mindfuck of all, the part that really makes me hate myself, is that today on day 2 of half dose (well first went down from .7 g to .5, and now day 2 of .25), I actually physically feel... ok. Not great but not really very sick anymore. My body's acclimated. But my mind... ugh... I don't even have such bad depression as I did yesterday. Honestly the only thing that's making me crave digging into the rest is simply that I WANT TO FEEL HIGH. ""Normal"" is not enough for me. I wanna be in the fuckin clouds and I'm willing to risk/sacrifice our food/gas budget, my injured SO's health (has bad open wound from excision of flesh following abscess), and so much else.

Or at least part of me is. Right now that part is losing. Right now I'm not planning to do anymore today, and indeed to take even less tomorrow.

Anyone in the same boat? Anyone do this on a regular basis to keep their tolerance under control? I'd love to hear about your experience, what you've found is key to managing it. For example I think staying busy is important.",1518842759.0

First off I love this community. Everyone here seems really cool and understanding. Okay now let’s get to the juicy part. I just got done taking a h break for a week. Me and my best bud picked up some decent quAlity for h the area then we immediately went to my house . Btw it was #4. And also just to give you an idea of how hard it is to see I have to close my left eye and squint really hard ima try and turn down my brightness . . . . . It kind of worked lol. Back to the story when we got home we cut it in half in then I realize my friend is already kind of fucked up. And I know the dude we buy from usually hooks him up and me also because we’re tight so I then go to he bathroom and what do you know I find a credit card with h on it and a dollar bill rolled up and a lotto ticket with a lil bit of powder left too! And I know he got this for free because it was all the money we both had. So while this dude nods out and is snoring.i do my line and his line. Then cut out another line did it . Put it under his dresser that he always puts it under .  Then I waited a couple of minutes tried to wake him up for about 10 mins he finally woke up we did the rest . He didn’t even notice how little there was lol. Now he’s asleep and I’m nodding out writing this post . Judge me if you want but I think I did what I felt was right . Because if me and him went half in on something and I got hooked up I would split it with him like I wouldn’t be getting that hook up if he didn’t give me the money. Idk tho now I’m just gonna nod out and watch the alienist ;) sorry if this post is horrible I’m really fucked up. I’m also extremely anti social and don’t have a lot of friends . I’m really anxious and don’t feel comfortable talking to people . H helps me talk to people. I’m not gonna lie I love the feeling it gives me. And I know that if I’m not careful it can ruin my life. I’m very careful on how much I do and how often I do it. I also take a 1or two week break if I feel like my tolerance is to high. I’m Almost done if your still reading lol. I highly recommend to watch The Alienist while nodding its amazing. Anyways cya!,1518842539.0

I only use brand new rigs and needles and I always use alcohol prep pads to steralize the injection site and to sterilize the vial.  I use 2 different needles 1 to draw the med and the other to administer it.

My doc gave me 12 T3s for 9/10 level pain and an antibiotic....

Understand, I have a mechanical aortic valve and take blood thinners so this tooth isn’t getting pulled for at least seven days. That means over a week of living with a throbbing painful puss filled mouth blister and only codeine to comfort me.  

I took eight T3s over a period of three days and called her yesterday when my pain spiked again. I was in tears and left a message which she returned just before her office closed. She said she’d send a stronger script to my pharmacy and made an appointment with a dentist in the morning. 

I jumped in the car and high tailed it to the drug store only to find 30 more T3s waiting for me. I was fucking irate. That bitch played me.  

Fast forward ten hours, 4am and the right side of my face is swollen and my head is on fire. I’m pacing the living room, waiting for 8am to come so I can see my dentist, while imagining horrible death scenarios involving my physician and writing sharply worded letters in my head to her, her boss, the FDA, the DEA...

Despite the unmanageable pain I’m  really trying to TAKE THIS SHIT AS PRESCRIBED  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE but I breakdown and eat about six of the T3s no CWE and an hour later, I fall asleep. :)

Morning comes and the dentist says the tooth has to go, which I already knew. We get to know one another well enough during the examination that on my way out the door he hands me a script for twenty 5/325 Percocet. 

I fucking love him, but I suppress the urge to hug him and head back to the pharmacy, for a third time this week where I’m lectured about the dangers of combining Codeine and oxycodone but I know better. 

The counter of this pharmacy is decorated with antique glass drug bottles, some with original contents still intact. I always mean to snap a photo of their counter to post here because this the only place I know where it would be appreciated as much as I appreciate it.

I know Codeine is a pretty shit high compared to others. 

I’ve used a hand full of opiates over the last 5-7 years mostly oxys, percs and Ds even smoked dope once or twice (never used a spike and don’t plan on it) but usually really low doses compared to some bigger habits, I never developed a habit or really used on my own would just snort Roxie’s and Ds, eat the percs because I didn’t want to fuck my nose up with all the extra shit. I admit I have an addictive personality but ive never fell much into opiates so I’m blessed to be able to enjoy them pretty rarely, I don’t seek them. Today i ran into like a 30x I think, Teva 15mg Codeine pills, they’re tiny and yellow with an imprint I think a letter and 2 digits, don’t have them with me but I know they’re 100% scripted out of the UK. Anyways wondering what you guys would think a good dose is? I did like 90mg today but I felt sick from some bad food I’m assuming or something because I had a head ache before I took them but I ended up with an even bigger headache and pretty buzzed but I regretted wasting a decent high. Still have more though. Felt weak and almost nauseous really. I know that can be common but essentially was wondering if that was too big of a dose or should I assume it was feeling shitty earlier and leave it at that? I know it would only be assumptions but since you guys have probably dealt with this more than I have I found this sub to be appropriate. There’s always good harm reduction here. I’m mid 20s 140-150lbs male if that helps you guys. Is 90mg with a reset tolerance (months without a pain killer smoked a tiny bit of H, like 50-150mg in one day and got sick as fuck it was nice dope) too high of a dose for someone my size? I’ve been told 100mg max starters and other told me they’ve done 200-300mg and that seems like ENTIRELY too much for a first time tolerance situation, you can always take more but never take back what you took.

When should I take sub before/after getting high? I know it’s no problem if I just stay on the sub, but I’ve been skipping a day before I get high. I won’t have PWD, will I? The bupe is prob still in my blood, right? Then I can just dose more sub when I’m done getting high. Also, more specifically, I just sniffed 2mg. Going to get high tomorrow (and the next few days). I actually feel pretty decent. Should I save the other 2mg powder I had crushed up then? I don’t wanna block the precious heroin tomorrow night lol


 So I’ve been on subs legitimately for a little over a month now. Did about 30 days totally clean of other opioids, did have a little crack binge and I’ve been messing around with powdered etizolam like a GENIUS. 


I wasn’t really against doing drugs, I actually quit for my gf at the time who then dumped me literally the day I got on subutex. Yeah. Came home after all that to find a $410 settlement check I wasn’t expecting and didn’t do anything to deserve (thanks Adderall XR!) and somehow I STILL didn’t go out and relapse. Because my mom was the other thing keeping me clean.


I really only need my mom to THINK I’m clean though, and I’m on fucking prescription opioids anyway. We’ve always been kind of don’t ask don’t tell and now that she found out about the heroin problem she’s doing more asking. I still have plenty of time and resources to do what I love, though, which is to get high on heroin and cocaine. 


Everyone esp online made it sound like I wasn’t gonna be able to get high, or like if i could it’d take a whole gram shot or something. Well, I happened to skip a day before I saw my boy, he racked me out two fat rails of ECP and also passed me, a few times, a sweet little handheld dab rig that worked really well for tar. Pretty much heaven for this “recovered” junkie who went from all day everyday to being able to actually wait and save and get high like I really want, when I deserve it. I’m learning how to be a functional deviant. It’s pretty amazing, really, because even two months ago I wouldn’t consider not doing what it took to get high each and every day.

Anyway, I wasn’t really ON sub when I got high before, but I was enough to not go into PWD when I took the sub again later. I anticipate a little more blockage this time because I’ll have dosed around 30 hrs prior. Should I take small amounts of bupe each day while I’m on this little vacation? I’ll prob be getting high about 5 days in a row. Is that long enough that I’d have to do the whole sub induction thing again?

Thanks for reading my e-book! ( I just have a lot to say sometimes and it doesn’t make sense without the details. Hopefully someone finds it entertaining, I love when people hate on posts like this, like, if you suck at reading and this page looks scary to you move your scary ass on out the way)",1518823099.0

I need your help confirming if this is a Naltrexone pill or not. It was a free gift from an online friend among other stuff, but I haven't used it for months because the lack of markings bothers me. We're not in contact any more so I can't ask him where he got it from.

One side is scored and the other is just plain no markings.

Has anybody ever seen or used an unmarked naltrexone pill? Perhaps it's from a country like India and came in a blister pack, hence why there's no markings? I'm only even considering it because it is orange, the proper color, and because I'm using it for ULDN. If it's inert or something else entirely, I doubt 0.2% of the pill can cause adverse effects.

Thoughts? I know I could just buy more, but if the blister pack tablets are unmarked then it's likely legitimate.

I was arrested the other night after picking up I stopped at a gas station and before I could even go inside I set my gps and texted back a few friends, i go to get out and 2 cars roll up blocking me in and hit me with flashlights, they told me to stay in the car and came up to me asked me why I was there and I said I was going to get something to eat inside then get gas on one of the pumps, they asked me to step outside and they searched the car and found a bag of loose dope and 2 more stamp bags, they brought me in and I didn't say anything to them. I was In this holding cell and kept asking what we were waiting for and they said my charges were pending, hours later they finally say they got them and it's two accounts of possession. They booked me and then I was told I had a bond of 2,500 and someone had to bring 250 but after my buddy that I had called and left a voicemail with called back they said he could pick me up and they would just give me a promise to appear so I just had to show up at court and my buddy didn't have to pay a bondsman. 

I was arrested when I was 18 for possession and I went to court and the district attorney told me he was giving me a pre trail drug education program to take and it was 15 classes I had to do once a week and then I would have to do 40 hours of community service and come back in a year and I would get it dropped, I did that and they dropped the charges, I never had to take drug tests or had probation so I never really stopped using, it was on and off for a while then a long break until 6 months ago I started using heavily again. Im 20 years old now and the court date they gave me is for 2 weeks from the arrest date.

Now here is what's freaking me out, I've been checking pending convictions online every day and they just showed up yesterday and they didn't charge me with possession they charged me with two accounts of possession with intent to distribute. They never told me this and I'm scared shitless because Possesion is just a misdemeanor here and with intent is a felony so I have 2 felony charges pending against me. My dad left years ago and my mom isn't really competent so I'm on my own with this one. I would get a lawyer but I can't afford one, last time I was at court they said I wouldn't be offered a public defender because i didn't need one, I'm guessing they will probably offer one to me this time

I'm just really scared because I'm still pretty young and I have wanted to stop this shit for a long time but I'm afraid of what the outcome is going to be and that I'm going to have a felony for the rest of my life and that would fuck me up majorly
Any advice or expiernces of getting arrested with these charges or anything similar would be appreciated immensely
Thank you so much 

TL;DR I am 20 years old and was arrested with two accounts of Possesion which is what the cops told me but later found out through the judicial website that it's two felony possession with intent to distribute charges, what should I expect to happen and is there anything else I should do?

You were depressed, or had some form of ptsd or life trauma that pushed you to drug use, yet every single person who has gotten clean for more than a few months says that they’re finally “happy again” or whatever, that it “gets so much better when you’re free from your addiction.” How is that possible? To me, that’s like saying that someone who is suicidally depressed can just pick up a heroin habit and when they get clean all their previous problems will have disappeared. I guess my question is how exactly do you mean you’re happier? Is it just that with an addiction you still have the same problems so you go from bad to worse and going back to just bad feels almost normal then? Or does getting clean somehow really allow you to be happy again?",1518815519.0

I took about 3 mg over a few hours on Wednesday. I took about .5 at a time, because I felt like it wasn't working. I think I may have had somewhat of PWD's- it wasn't unbearable, but I did not get well from the sub. Whatever, toughed it out, and the next morning I took about 1mg, maybe a little more. It worked, but again, I still didn't feel 100% like I usually do when I take sub. Later on in the day I took about 2mg before bed, and it still didn't get me fully well. I woke up not even 12 hours later feeling restless and kind of sick.

So, this morning I took about 1mg. I STILL didn't feel that good this morning after that sub. So I've taken about 5mg over the past few days, so it's obviously in my system. 

I don't know why the induction has been so rough- it's never been like this before. Usually I am good after 1mg for a whole day. But I don't know what the problem was this time. If I had PWD's, I don't see why 48 hours later I would still not be feeling relief from sub. 

So, today, I ended up getting some dope. I did about a bun and a half over the past few hours and I finally felt relief. I didn't think I would feel the dope after all that sub, but I did, and still do. 

Now, my questions are why I had such a tough time inducting, and how to avoid having this problem tomorrow. I want to continue taking sub, don't want to use, but today just happened as it did and that's that. I know that I want to stop so I am not getting discouraged. But, I want to know if I should still wait 24 hours til I really feel sick, or if I can just take sub when I wake up to avoid having cravings and all. I obviously have sub in my system, so I'm wondering if doing dope and getting high was just luck, and that sub is still going to be attached to my receptors and I won't get PWD again if I take it after 17-18 hours when I wake up.
