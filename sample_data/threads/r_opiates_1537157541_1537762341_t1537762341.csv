Although I knew you are supposed to remove the tourniquet after registering, I didn't do it after several times the vein moved or the needle slipped out and I had to redo the shot.

After inquiring about it, I realized how TERRIBLE this is for your veins and under no circumstance should you tie off close to the injection site and leave it on.

I wake up to someone urinating in the apartment above hers.

	
	
The stream is thick and heavy falling into the toilet water. There are one, two, three stop and go splashes like an ellipsis in my mind and then the chink of the lever. Water runs through the pipes in the ceiling overhead and down the far wall. My body doesn’t move, but my eyes take inventory of the apartment. Our spoons and syringes have been put away. By Beth I presume. She is stuck in the act of lighting a candle. A match in one hand. The box in the other, and the Autumn Apple candle sits unlit on the coffee table. Beth is hunched over it. She looks like a computer game character stuck in a glitch of unnatural and repetitive movement. She bounces, nodding out just to barely wake back up several times each second. It’s something I used to do. Shoot. It’s something I’ll probably be doing a lot of here soon. 
	
I sit up. I lean forward on the couch. There’s still plenty of dope in me, but I am coming down. My body parts move in one slow and sleepy pull after another. My nose itches. It’s something like birth sitting there slimy and sweaty and confused on her couch, cold and wet, coming to grips with the depression of reality after spending those few hours in nirvana. It’s not that depressing, though. There are still 14 bags of heroin in my pocket, a place to stay for the night and a hook up on some pure. That’s my reality right, now. I rub my face and try to stand. 
	
Beth must sense me moving around and wakes up to spend another minute or so getting a match lit and all the way to the wick of the candle before it goes out. Evening’s blue light glows over the roofs across the street. A siren whines through traffic somewhere in the distance. Curtains hang like half closed eyelids in the square windows pouring out that warm golden light from inside of the buildings out into the darkness. They are portals into the lives of families and single folk home for dinner or watching the evening news. They show me something I want, like paintings on a giant museum wall portraying normal kinds of life I’ll never know, reminding me of everything I’m not. There’s a gurgle in my gut asking me to eat.
 
So, I ask Beth,
	
“You got anything to eat or drink?”
	
She says, “There’s O.J. in the fridge,” and holds two fingers to her chin for a moment. Her eyes close slowly. They open. Beth strikes a match and finally gets the candle lit.  	
	
I pull the handle on the refrigerator door and look in. There’s a two-liter bottle of soda next to the orange juice and a few hotdogs wrapped in cellophane and a bottle of ranch dressing and a bottle of vinaigrette in the door with some milk. There’s an open half-dozen carton with three eggs left in it. In the back is a can of spam covered in tinfoil. I whisper into the cold white light, 
	
“Spam Baby,” and grab the O.J.
	
An old wine glass is all I can find in the cabinet. It’s an awkward thing to drink out of, but it works. I see a couple of bananas and a bag of some dried-out berries and sesame seeds next to the microwave. When I open the bag and sniff, my head does one of those spasmatic and involuntary jerks. I hold it up and shout out to her in the living room.
	
“What’s this crap? Hamster food?” I am not entirely convinced a hamster would eat it, but I already know it’s hers. Beth eats like that. That’s why she’s so thin.
	
“No. That’s mine.” 
	
“You eat this?” 
	
She laughs. “Yeah. I do.”
	
“Who else’s been staying here?”
	
“What?”
	
“The spam in the back of the fridge?”
	
“What? Oh you saw that?”
	
“Yeah. Don’t you know about Spam Babies?”
	
“Spam Babies? What? Oh, no! My kid!” 
	
Beth grabs her hoodie lying on the floor and has it in her hand walking backwards out the door. Her keys are in her hand. She tells me she’ll be right back. The apartment is quiet and dark. It has a nice energy. Candle flame flickers orange in the living room. The room is warm, and the couch is comfortable. 

16

Martin’s apartment door is painted white and has three black metal numbers on it.

	
	
Soft steps move towards the door. Martin is talking on the phone. He opens it and gestures for us to sit on the couch. I just called him from Beth’s this morning, after she let me cook up the rest of that can of Spam in her refrigerator. She made plans to drop the kid off at her sisters, again, and now, here we are. Martin is wearing a bathrobe. He paces while he talks.  
	
“Yeah! Mom! Those are my chickens and my rooster. I don’t care if Larry said he’s the one feeding them. They’re not his to give away. Mom! No. Listen….. No way….. That’s wrong and you know it….Well, he never gave me a chance. Did he? Did he? That’s my rooster! And I don’t care!” He stamps his foot down on the clean beige carpet as he screams, like a child throwing a fit. Beth giggles. She looks at me and makes as if to ask, is this really happening? It is. 
	
Martin’s like that. I don’t know how to say it, except that in all the years that I’ve known him, there’s been one constant. He makes me want to punch him in the face. Not all the time but often. It’s just the effect he has on people. He’ll hurt you the way children hurt you with honest and unflinching observation. Martin will attack your character for no good reason. Say something he doesn’t like, and he’ll tell you how that’s an expression of your extremely hideous nature as a human in his condescending tone. You’re disgusting. That seems to be his answer for anyone who disagrees with him or offends him.
 
Another thing about it is that Martin disperses these little bits of unwelcome info with conceited wags of the head, like some sophisticated version of a chick in the ghetto. His wrists are thin, too. Now, I have nothing against men with feminine affectations. That would be a waste of time, but subconsciously, I think that he and I share some of those attributes, and perhaps my fear is that I’m walking around as feminine and rude as he is and no one is telling me. The thought is horrifying and perhaps a source of pent up anger, but like I said, I’m not the only one. Plenty of people have had their issues with him. 


Back in the day, it was Peter Donaldson, Martin and me. We were always together. They were the first people I ever got high with, at least on things besides weed, like mushrooms and Percocet and LSD and ecstasy and even some bumps of cocaine once or twice. All the other kids called us the Trippy Trio on account of there were three of us and all the psychedelics we liked to take. 

Petey was a great guy. I miss him, now. Unfortunately, he dropped some acid one night with some other kids out on the countryside. This was after we got out of high school and kind of drifted apart from each other. They were out there drinking liquor and dosing and a car smashed Petey on the highway. The kids he was with saw it all. Legend has it that all that was left of him could be scraped off the asphalt and fit into a shoebox, like all that was left of him was a puddle of sludge with a few organs floating in it or something. Maybe, the better way to say it is that legend had it, because I’m not sure anyone talks about it enough to consider it a legend, anymore. His mother and father in their mourning have left off telling it. I’m sure. It’s been 13 years. Besides, the phrase ‘fit into a shoebox’ doesn’t strike me as the kind of language my dead friend’s parents would use in talking about the tragedy. He was their only son. They only have their daughter left, but that was the story for a long time. All that was left of Petey could be fit into a shoebox. 

I wanted to care. I really did, when I found out, but I’d just figured out how to inject myself, homeless in the city of San Francisco at 19 years old and was doing a lot of meth. My father had died the year or so before that. Big shots of crank had already hammered my mind into hamburger meat my first week down there, and I’d completely lost it. I was answering phone calls from strange men who wanted to pay me for some company or picking through piles of refuse on the sidewalk for clothes to wear, always looking like some prehistoric savage on my skateboard with stolen hood ornaments hanging from my waist and strange fur hats and goggles while I cut in and out of deadly traffic in the rain. It was as if I was living out the fantasy of some depraved comic book character my drug addled imagination had created. My mind kept slipping into these paranoid schizophrenic fogs. I was committing crimes. I was injecting drugs. Caring just wasn’t possible. 

It makes me sad now, when I think about it. Petey was genuinely the nicest guy I knew my age, and that’s not one of those skewed postmortem affirmations of his character people like to give. He really was. Everyone knew that. Petey definitely deserved more of a chance at life than me or Martin, but now, Martin and I are all that are left. 
He’s wrapping up the phone call now and sitting on the couch across from us. Beth and I sit in chairs. The view through the window behind him shows a crane and city buildings, the water behind that. It’s right downtown.

“Okay, mom. I’ll talk to you soon.” He hangs up and tosses the phone on the couch next to him. “Well, Randy. Good to see you. What’s it been?” I haven’t seen him since I got sober. 

“Two years. Just about. This is a really nice place, man. What are you doing these days?”

“I got my law degree. Finally. I think I was wrapping that up, right? Last time we saw each other?” He ignores Beth like she isn’t there with us. I don’t remember what he was doing with his life the last time I saw him, other than buying large quantities of black tar from me at a high price, sleazing it up on the car lot as a salesman and putting me down when we got high together in his last apartment. It wasn’t near as nice as this one.  

“Yeah. Sure. I think that sounds right.” I smile.

“But, you know how it goes.” 

I have no idea how it goes for a person with a law degree, but I nod. “Sure.”

“Yeah. My mom really wants me to get on with a firm around here. She has all kinds of friends who can get me on at some of the biggest in town, but I’m still selling cars. Money’s just way, way too good and way too easy, Randy. Way too easy for me.” Martin gives me a deviant smile. “Who’s this?”

“This is Beth.” I say. She reaches out to shake his hand over his glass coffee table. 

“Nice to meet you,” he says as he sits back down. “So, what’s up, Randy? What’s this all about?”

I throw one of the D.O.A. baggies onto the glass. He picks it up, studies it and looks at me. 

“What’s this?”

“What does it look like?”

“I’m asking you. Looks like a small line of coke.”

“Heroin.”

“But it’s white.”

“China White.”

“What’s that?” 

“Number four.”

“You know, Randy, we’re not all lifelong junkies like you. Okay?” There are hints of that condescension I told you about, but it’s not that bad, not like it can be. 

“It’s pure stuff.”

“Pure?” His face is pointed down at the bag in his hand. His eyes look through slits up at me, like he’s skeptical. 

“Get your rig out. You’ll see.” I say.


17

Before Martin even gets up to get his shooting gear, he asks me how much I have.

I count in my head the 16 that Sal gave me yesterday. I subtract the two that Beth and I did last night. That’s 16 minus two, so 14. Then, two for me and one for Beth, right now. That’s 14 minus three. So, 11 bags I can part with.
	
“Got 11 bags I can sell, right now.” I tell him. 
	
“How much?”
	
“I want 20 a piece for each.” The reason I say it like that is that I know that’s now how much they are. Something about myself won’t let me tell outright lies. I have to talk around things to get away with stuff. 
	
“So, 220? What about two bills, even?”
	
“You got it.” I let him think he’s getting a deal.  

I pull the sandwich bag out of my pocket and separate three of the little square D.O.A. baggies from the rubber banded bundle inside of it. Martin walks into his bedroom. Beth opens her eyes wide. She can’t believe it. When Martin comes back, he’s holding an ornately carved mahogany cigar box with a golden placard too worn down to read and two hundred-dollar bills. He lays the bills on the table and sets the box down. I toss him the 11 baggies in the rubber band. 

Beth pulls a syringe out of her purse for herself and one for me. She hands it to me. Martin is making clanking and tapping sounds with what I guess is a spoon and a lighter and whatever else he’s using. I can’t see what he’s doing on the other side of the box. The rubber band snaps. Beth touches my shoulder with a plastic bottle cap. She has one for herself, and we repeat the process of the day before. Beth sterilizes her arm with alcohol and ties off. I just start digging in the meat of my forearm, right away. Martin has his foot on the table, looking for a vein in his foot. Soon, all three of us are leaning forward in our seats, like we’re playing some weird game of who can get their foreheads closest to the table without touching it. 

“…So good,” comes out of Beth’s mouth in a whisper. There’s some indistinct mumbling on either side of the words.


My eyes are closed. Chunks fill my mouth. I try to hold it in but fall out of my chair hurrying to the sink. The masticated chunks of pink, partially digested Spam spew onto the carpet. A nasty orange slime coats them like an afterbirth of the little aborted fetuses. They have a putrid stench, lying gross upon the floor. Shouldn’t have had that orange juice. I think to myself. Some more comes out. It burns my nose, and strings of the stinky slime hang from my chin. 

Martin is out, though. I got what I came for. Better get out of here, before he wakes up and starts complaining about the vomit and its smell. So, I shake Beth awake and tell her we have to go. It’s hard for her to walk, but we get out and down the stairs to her car. She’s buckled up in the driver’s seat. I’m buckled up in the passenger’s seat.  We are both slumped forward and nodded out.

Learn from me!,"Ok so I'm no spring chicken is this dope game, been doing it for opiates for damn near a decade.   

I always had plenty of connects and was pretty plugged in to where the best dope was at and things just rolled along really smooth...

That was until 6 days ago, I had been working closely with my LONG TIME MAIN GUY and his guy like clockwork for the last few months since my relapse.  So wouldn't you know it the words thing happens, all 3 of the guys I go to just vanished!  The only explanation I can think of is they were all together and got busted or went out of town.  Something like this has never happened to me before.  The worst is I'm in a relapse for 3 months and before that I had like 9 months clean time so I deleted all my backups or they changed numbers.  Right now I'm a functional addict and work a demanding full time construction leadership role where a 20 man crew is depending on my skills.  There was no warning from my guys so I couldn't stock up or do anything to prepare.  I called Monday evening after work and was greeted with a disconnected phone.  So Ive been deathly sick everyday since, now 6 days with no change.  Tried Kratom and Lope, which did help but nothing major.  This is a terrible place to be in due to me not being able to just crawl in bed, I have to go to work and be on point.  I guess it could also be a blessing since it's forcing me to get clean lol.

Learn from my lesson here, no matter how smooth things have been going with your main plug, it never hurts to have a couple solid back up connects..and to keep them in rotation like spend a lil bit every week with them just so you what kind of dope they are working with.  It's really another story of getting to comfortable with a single routine.  It was going so good everyday for years that I just started not caring about other plugs and it bit me in the ass big time. 

It's a funny game this dope hustle, the users depend on their plugs, in order to have a functional life.  It becomes so much more important when ur working to get ur shit so your not puking and shitting your brains out all day.  The dealers honestly don't give two shits about your situation and that bothers me.  If they did just head out on vacation or something why not let me know so I could stock up.  

Lessons from this mess:
- Don't do opiates, you just can't win with these things
- Have backup plugs even if things are going perfect with your main source
- If you can manage to build an emergency stock pile, DO IT! I always wanted to take like .1 out of each gram I buy and place it in a nice sealed container, then after a stretch of good time there would be a couple grams for situations just like this..
- Try to establish a good line of communication with your plugs, maybe you can avoid this kind of mess
- BE THE PLUG, You don't have to worry about shit if you cut out the people in the middle

I guess this turned out to be more of a rambling complaint.  It's just beyond frustrating when you get the rug pulled out from under you.  I have plenty of money and I'm mobile but I'm stuck waiting and hoping their phones magically come back on.  Sure I found a backup to go thru, but it makes me mad pissing money down the drain for short sub par dope.  

Please share your similar stories of times your line on good dope just vanished without a trace...what did you do to get by?  Im just sitting here sick as hell twiddling my thumbs and praying to JJ looking for a blessing.

I have sat outside myself with all of these thoughts and more and I think that I am absolutely nuts for continuing.    No withdrawal is as bad as this.  But i persist because I am ever the only one here.   And in that shot is the little death of all the swirling madness, instantly off.

I’ve been on 16mg suboxone daily maintenance for about 3 and 1/2 weeks. This weekend, I wanna have a little fun and revisit my oxy smokin habit. I like to smoke the real, pharma oxy 30s and I also like the ones pressed with fent (I know all the dangers, whatever whatever I’m an experienced opiate user). 

So, I’m probably gonna cop one or two of each, as I have solid plugs for the real deals, as well as other plugs that openly advertise that their blues are pressed. 

Basically my question is:

Will I have any luck with the oxy if I wait at least 24hr from my last bupe dose? I believe the fent is strong enough to break through even if I’ve taken bupe the same day, correct me if I’m wrong ",1537749125.0

This is my very first post on reddit and it's surely for a reason. It's not very easy to find information about this kind of stuff or at least that's how it appears after a few searches, so I've decided to ask this lovely community for help. Please let me be very clear, this is NOT an attempt to purchase, find where to purchase, make or sell anything. My goal is to create a 1 for 1 xanax press in a game I'm developing. The game is all about roleplaying life and I want to develop a beautifully looking xanax feature for those who roleplay as a drug dealer.

* I need to know how Xanax is made.
* I would like to create a 3D model of a press, assuming that's what is used when creating it so I need some images of what it would look like.
* What're the different types of xanax? I've seen different colors associated with dosage I believe?
* What are the commercial/homemade ways it's made?
* What ingredients are used and which are legal / illegal?

Thank you, have a great day,

I would like to read all of your responses.

I've had a 90-120mg oxy insufflation addiction for at least 2 years.   Ive been taking them for about 6 years but these last 2 years have drained my account and they aren't fun anymore at all.  Heres the kicker.. my wife is in the same spot.  Her's started after a car accident 7 years ago and I started eating her 15's.  It started innocently enough where her 120 tab a month script would fulfill us both... and as you know the rest is history.  The last year we run out at about the 10 day mark and this starts the 2 hour round trips to pick up dropping several hundred at a clip every handful of days and I'm disgusted. We're practically broke now.  We've decided that she's going into an inpatient detox while I brave the storm in the real world.  I've got work to attend to and there's no chance I can just lay in bed.   The good part is my job is flexible so I can schedule things accordingly but I do have to be on at the very least my ""C game"" to manage my people at work.  I've also got children to get to school and pick up...feed.. ..after school activities.. etc etc. She checks in tomorrow and I've got enough to get me through to this evening.   Tonight it starts and I'm scared.  She's the rock here and now I'm needing to handle all my shit and the normal daily doings of hers wth the kids.  We made this decision because we're each others worst enemy in terms of enabling and I think the approx 5 day split will be the best route. I have plenty of Kratom (tried it when I got it and it was cool but def liked sniffing my pills more and put it aside as I knew this day was coming) some tizanidine (muscle relaxer) and 2 valiums  .. that's it.

So to get right to the point, I recently got surgery and got my mouth wired shut, among other things. Now to take my medication, I have to mix with a drink and drink through a straw. The taste is almost unbearable. I have Oxycodone 10/325 and Valium 5. Now my question is, and again I apologize for my ignorance towards this situation, but am I able to ‘plug’ these pills? &amp; if so , how do I go upon doing so? I have an oral syringe, I just have no idea how to go about setting it up. I know it sounds funny but gotta do what you gotta do. Help would be greatly appreciated. 

Also, just to clarify as to one of the rules I read here on reddit, I have googled/bing searched this question multiple times with no good results so I thought this would be a good place to ask this question.",1537721583.0

I should be getting “mexican refined tan powder heroin,” soon... Chatted with my source and here are the deets.","I ordered it cause it was listed With keywords TAN, POWDER, RARE, HEROIN.  Thus, you’d think its #4, snortable H, happened to be made in Mexico.  I HAVE seen true mexican #4, white/light tan H.  So I buy it.

Source replies to my question:  this is mexican #4 right? Thats why its listed as refined tan POWDER?

He tells me it is NOT. He says it WILL tar up but due to its refined level and purity, it won’t under normal circumstances.  

So basically, let’s mentally work this out.  Mexican BTH is typically a little bit of heroin acetate, with a lot of 6-MAM salts.  Now let’s refine it so that it’s TAN not black or dark brown, and so that its a powder normally, not sticky clumps.  

Im thinking, to get my money’s worth, I’ll have to freeze it, grind it, give a little inositol shake up, and slow microwave treatment until it’s ALL moisture is gone and the hydroscopic properties are fucked.  Then, after scraping the powder off the plate, I should be left with snortable powder that I wont be worried about keeping in a normal bag.  Idk.  Im frustrated he didnt say anYthing sooner.  Tan fucking powder?? Okay but if it can tar up, it aint a POWDER. Its a temporarily dry and crushed version of tar. Fuck.",1537719341.0

If someone falls out do not panic. If they are breathing ok monitor them until they wake up and put them in the ""recovery position"" if there breathing becomes too shallow call the paramedics the ""good samaritan law"" is in place in most places in the US and you and the victim of od will be immune to drug charges not related to dealing. If Their breathing stops begin CPR and administer Narcan as soon as possible. People have been saved by cpr alone. You wont die if your lungs are getting oxygen. 

If you don't use for a day or more due to choice or means out of your control (getting arrested) DO NOT use the same amount of opiates as you were before the break. Tolerance Drops FAST and this is how many people have died

Opiates should not be combined with benzodiazepines for recreation. Better and smarter men then us have died of it. (im one to talk i fucking love it)

I did it, and I only brought enough to drive for 4 days.
Got here, did a methadone taper, and have been clean for a few months.
But... I wanted to get high. since I don't know anybody here and I'm fairly certain they don't have heroin here (never seen anything like it. 50 people in line at the methadone clinic and none of them have ever tried heroin. Is it all pills.).
I had never tried meth or ice before but I figured high is a high. Ummm... No the f*** it's not. I don't even know how to describe how upsetting the last 6 days have been. First, I bought$100 worth because I didn't know how it comes, I started shooting a little bit at a time. every time I get a hit I'd feel dazed and confused for a couple minutes and then not high. or at least, not anything I would have considered to be fun. 4 days in a row I spent hours trying to hit myself. My arms had completely healed in the months I've been here. Now, I can't find a vein anywhere on my body and I am covered in track marks and bruises. I've got no clue why anyone would do such a thing to themselves, and I assure you I won't do it again but now here I am-at my real question. 
When I bought the ice from the guy, I asked him if he knew where to get any heroin. Today he knocked on my door with 10 mg Roxy's. It's not H, but I almost cried when I saw them. It was like my long-lost lover coming back from war. 
I spent a ridiculous amount of time reading posts about how to break it down and get it ready, and now I can't hit. Like, for real, not my feet, not my legs, not my arms. The state I'm in does not allow syringe sale without a prescription and the only place that seems willing to sell them is Walmart, and they only have 1/2 ml 31g, 5/16 ones. With such a short needle, my femoral is out. I just can't get to it. I've never hit in my neck before- I'm not necessarily scared but I can't find a good post telling me what's safe (er) and how to avoid an artery.
I triple filtered the Roxy so I'm not worried about getting particles or fillers in my vein. 
I'm super annoyed that the largest capacity needle they sell is the 1/2 ml because I've got four of them. There was no way to condense it with the amount of water needed to break down the pills. 
That was really long winded, but can somebody please give me a little jugular vein run down, unless you have a really good idea that I haven't thought of yet.

Snorted as soon as I got up, middle of the day on break/transitioning classes (first semester of a paid scholarship to UNCG), and would snort the rest of the oxy i had for the day and popped whatever opiod pills I could cop for cheap at night; nodding my life away. I would smoke weed all throughout the day as well. I like to believe I was a functioning addict, but I know that I was just functioning enough to get by and not lose my job or have my grades go to shit. 

Lived with family who highly disapproved of any drug usage at all. They knew about the weed, would always threaten to kick me out. Which then happened in November, however, they never knew about the pills until I told them that night. Had nowhere to go and couldn’t live on my own because all my money went into pills and weed. This was right before Thanksgiving, family now wanting nothing to do with me. Ended up staying with a friend for about a week which I was withdrawing horribly until I checked myself into a ten day rehab detox program. 

Been clean since November 18th, 2017. 

I appreciate being sober because I realize how much of an impact it had on my life. Never went back to school, was forced anyways by my family, lost all connection with my family and have no one but my mom now who is states away and a couple friends where I’m at now. Been attending NA meetings every Sunday.

I do enjoy smoking every now and then, all in moderation - but I realized I can never touch any opiod again, especially after trying lean in May thinking I might be able to recreationally enjoy any opiod again. Was able to control myself along with some supportive friends.

I still live day by day struggling on my own working two part time jobs, and sometimes wish I can go back and never have dug the hole I put myself in because I knew I had so much opportunity to do well yet all I cared about was the next pill i’m crushing up.

If you took the time to read this, thank you. I never have gotten to tell my story to much of anyone; I like to keep to myself.  

If you have the desire to get clean, you can do it. Your desire to get clean has to be greater than your desire to use. ",1537664993.0

His mom messaged my dad after I kept ignoring Cliff... she simply wanted to borrow a wheel chair that we have but no longer need. So my dad and I agreed to give her the wheelchair.


So as a result I kindly walked down the street to drop off the chair. Cliff asked why I haven't been around of why I was not answering messages. I just kinda bullshitted an apology because I didn't want to take on a accusatory tone which then would result in having hear his counterarguments.

""I been keeping my distance because...""

Then he'd say. ""No I don't..."" I just dont really want to even play that game. I fully expect gaslighting and hate dealing with that shit.

So anyway today he called and texted while I was legitimately at work. Not pretending to at work as is often the case.


After I stated my status he texted the following:

Now, as much as I'd hate to be inhumane and unreasonable uncaring about this but I'd also hate to u unsurprisingly surprised. How so? As the saga has gone before... an inconvenient request. He doesn't needs money he says but perhaps he needs something that costs money?

(I now a lot of you guys are not fans of this drug at all, or even loathe it, but for me personally, it's what got me addicted, and I'm actually able to have just as much, and even more, euphoria on this stuff as I do on heroin so, you know man, we all have different experiences). Thanks lads--and everybody else, too, I'm just Irish so sometimes I like to use it a bit like the gender neutral ""guys"" when talkin bout groups. Now let's get into this.

So as I mentioned, I'm high on codeine right now. The lights are off, I'm lying in my bed, have been for a while. Now, I know what nodding feels like, so when I was on my phone and noted that I could barely keep my eyes open, I presumed I was fighting the nod. I decided to give in and put my phone down (or didn't, and ""giving in"" was a much less conscious choice), let my eyes close and enjoy the ride. Well, I don't even really remember too well, but all I know is that suddenly (or not suddenly? It feels like it's been a while since then so honestly I don't even bloody know, but it happened alright?) I was having these strange, very strange because as far as I know I've never had this before, sober or high, lucid dream visions while my eyes were closed. It looked exactly like a dream, it felt exactly like one too (like the way I was moving in it and stuff, how that felt), the only thing that I believe was different is that I felt... conscious?  I think. When it happened I was certain, but now I'm not so sure, it all feels so much more hazy. Like, I was somehow ""aware"" where my body was, that I was still high lying in bed, I was aware what was happening, but yet still, something, as I look back, did feel ""different"". God, so odd and challenging to describe. 

Anyway, I'll move on. The visions? I was in the ocean. It felt aimless, and the ocean was dark. There were lots of fish. I know that the reason this was the setting is because I watched Finding Dory today (don't fucking judge, okay?). Before I realised this I believe I was just, here comes this word again, swimming around aimlessly without me being conscious, like not conscious not even as not awake like in a normal dream, but even aware of my existence or something. I felt I was just gone, but obviously, didn't acknowledge that I was gone. Now, after I was snapped back, I had this epiphany like, why the fuck am I in the ocean? I don't even want to be here, I don't like it being here and I'm fucking in control, I literally have the choice to leave, it's my goddamn dream! Some shit like that. So then I start trying to leave, I feel weird, not good and increasingly trapped till I start talking to some fish and then boom, I fucking jerk actually awake with the BIGGEST bloody jolt man, it was nuts.

My memory of what I described is getting weaker and weaker by the minute so, glad I wrote that down. But seriously though guys, is that normal or something? Is that nodding? Because whenever I've nodded out until now it's always just been falling in and out of conscious and my head hanging and my mouth wide open. Typical junkie pose. So what's up with this?? Maybe to most of you it's actually nothing but to me it was so very weird, so seriously, I'd really appreciate some words.

I found them pretty interesting (particularly the 2016 one) and thought you guys might enjoy them as well (or at least reading the abstracts/results and shooting the shit about them). Here are some questions I have that might help to get discussion going:

1. Are the findings of these articles in line with your experience as users?

2. Do you feel that market has changed substantially in the last few years with the rise of fentanyl and potent analogues? 

3. To what extent is branding/reputation relevant in heroin sales/purchasing specifically?

[**The Textures of Heroin: User Perspectives on “Black Tar” and Powder Heroin in Two US Cities (2016)**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5027195/)

ABSTRACT: 

Since the 1990s, US heroin consumers have been divided from the full range of available products: east of the Mississippi River, Colombian-sourced powder heroin (PH) dominates the market, while to the west, Mexican-sourced “black tar” (BTH) is the main heroin available. By conducting qualitative research in two exemplar cities, Philadelphia (PH) and San Francisco (BTH), we compare users’ experiences of heroin source-types, markets, health consequences and consumption preferences. The strict division of heroin markets may be changing with novel forms of powder heroin appearing in San Francisco. Our researchers and interviewees perceived vein loss stemming from the injection of heroin alone to be a particular problem of BTH while among the Philadelphia sample, those who avoided the temptations of nearby cocaine sales displayed healthier injecting sites and reported few vein problems. Abscesses were common across both sites, the Philadelphia sample generally blaming missing a vein when injecting cocaine and the San Francisco group finding several explanations, including the properties of BTH. Consumption preferences revealed a ‘connoisseurship of potency’, with knowledge amassed and deployed to obtain the strongest heroin available. We discuss the reasons that their tastes take this narrow form and its relationship to the structural constraints of the heroin market.

&nbsp;

[**Heroin in brown, black and white: Structural factors and medical consequences in the US heroin market (2009)**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2704563/)

ABSTRACT: 

Heroin coming into the United States historically comes from three widely dispersed geographical regions: Southwest Asia, Southeast Asia and Mexico. A fourth source of US-bound heroin, from Colombia, originated in the early 1990s. The fact that the four heroin sources produce differing morphologies and qualities of heroin has not been critically examined. In addition, it is not well established how the contemporary competing dynamics of interdiction, or restriction of heroin flows across international boundaries, and neoliberal, e.g., global expansion of free trade, policies are affecting heroin markets. This paper will highlight changes in the US heroin market, including source trends, the political economy of the now dominant source and the resultant effects on the heroin risk environment by US region.

&nbsp;

I'm really interested to hear what you guys think about these findings, and I'd love to see some discussion. Stay safe out there and take care of each other!

It's hell and im sick of it. I cant bring myself to just stop. I just get sick and miserable and cave in and find a way to get high. Ive tried kratom, suboxone, cold turkey... I always find my way back and lately ive just been giving completely in. I can get acid on wednesday, im experienced with it. Once i even stopped smoking cigarettes for months because i smoked one while tripping and it tasted nasty and i just didnt want to smoke anymore. It completely took the urge away. Im hoping i can get a certain mindset change like i did with that cigarette forever ago. Any advice on how to make it work? Is it okay to trip while i'm withdrawing a bit or will that contribute to a bad trip? Right now i go about 12-16 hours before starting wd, i get diahrea pretty bad, stomach pains, hot/cold flashes and low energy and very-veeeerrryyyy low mood. Im trying to get a friend to trip with me but i might just end up tripping by myself. Basically what i wanna know is how to make this the best eye opening, ego draining, mindset changing trip possible. My main question though is should i get a fix before i trip or not.

As I sit here in the day drowning my sorrow and time with a little Hank Williams St, I'm still steadily counting down til Monday... I mean fuck if I wanted to I could go over draft today but then I'd lose 35 bucks on my next trip on Monday. I mean I'm going to overdraft on Monday anyways as my paycheck hits Tuesday. Fuck all this math 2.5 days 60 hours ain't shit. My last dose was Thursday and my withdrawals ain't bad. I never have bad withdrawals with shitting my pants, but if you want some horror stories then ask about that part, or the not eating for 3 days with gagging and dry heaving, or this weird feeling of constantly having honey in my mouth and it's so thick and hard to live through the muck. It's just that lost longing feeling and a weight in my chest making it hard to breathe and the craving of warmth.

I work in withdrawal I live in withdrawal, they never told me about that part when I started. Buy the ticket take the ride, on down the lost highway. No money for Kratom, no money for relief. I'd rather suffer through it and get all my enjoyment all at once. People ask me why I put myself through it but I say fuck'em cause they'll never know and I hope and pray to God they don't. Heaven and hell on earth all at one time my brothers and sisters. We have transcended the plane of this world too many times. While some make it back to earth, some with help and some without. Some never make it back, be it the longest run of their life or the final dose that ended them.

You can’t fucking sleep and then when you do finally get to “sleep” you wake up with hot sweats less than an hour later and you had a dream you and your best friend with hella warrants got spotted in your car and you have to fuckin play hot speed pursuit on a one street in a small town with guns and two safes. then your boy jumps out of the fucking car at like 30 mph and you get woken up right before your fucking dream to see if the cop stopped for him or went after me. In my dream I told him I’d take it but he told me to fuck off w that &amp;amp; my clean record, then of course he jumps out so saves n all the guns but one r in there 😅. Fuck you dreams and fuck you sick bullshit. It was all fun and games until I found every excuse to keep going and then suddenly three months, two months heavy, when I already knew the fucking 2,3 day saying. This feeling almost brings me back to IV use detoxing but I was in a fuckin swanky ass rehab w whatever I wanted at the time. It’s all fun n games until you can’t stop shaking n biting your tongue, clenching your neck muscles instead of laying down normal. It’s all fun and games folks... shit, I know it’s addiction n it runs DEEP in my bio fam.. but like let’s be honest- do pros Outway the cons..fuck I don’t even know right now. dude I went from getting perfectly faded kinda buzzed off two hits off the foil. TWO. Two lovely hits to just relax after a long night tending. Soon three or four at night two in the morning. I’m sure you all know the pattern- well most of us. I thought I fucking had it. I already miss having my fucking shit together, that extra 60-80 a day not including the white n benzos I need to keep up w work. but physically I’m fucked n my body was already hurting before I went n inebriated myself beyond my norm. Ahhh I feel so self induced crazy. Not like psychosis cRazy, just about to start my period, waking up sick but also can’t smoke all of my bag or I’ll really have a bad morning before I go to the coast. Can I just fucking hit a fucking bottom already like it’s sad to say I feel like my tolerance has like plateaued so now I just wish I could go iv. I fuckin told myself I wouldn’t. And if I can just make it til Thursday so I have two 8mg subs I’ll rapid detox the fuck out of this shit. The  reason being no needles, I really don’t want to die- just temporarily remove those suicidal idolizing, anxiety crippling (*not seasonal*) depression and the fucked back from only ever working service industry. Is that too much to ask? I can’t risk losing my relationship with my niece dude. She three years old and both her parents took off on her and basically took my second niece to fucking Ohio where she was raised in the car the first year. Poor babe collar bones are fucked bc the seat belt wasalways on . Ahhhh my brain could go so many tangent right now.

On top of this I got into a fight with the plug over the dumbest shit. He thought I fucked his wife (I didn't but she wants it) and I said his pressed bars seemed weak since I ate 4 of them with very little tolerance(had a badly infected foot and was in extreme pain and just wanted it to stop) and didn't pass out or black out. He got super butthurt. On top of all this I'm in some mandated drug class shit for probation where I must attend weekly classes and get drug tested. I failed my last drug test and my PO totally spared me but now I have to do these classes and doubt she'd spare me again. 
                       All of this came together as a perfect storm of telling me it's time to stop. As bad as I hated it I quit cold turkey. No benzos or anything. I couldn't get any. I had/have no money at all and can't work anything out w plug bc he's butthurt. Well today is like day 5 of no drugs and I was doing some cleaning and found .3 of some fire brown in a watch pocket in a pair of my jeans. Fml! I'd been doing everything I could to avoid getting high. Didn't answer calls from ppl wanting me to middle, didn't hang out w my normal group of friends bc 1 might see me sick and offer to help. I just stayed in my room hating everything. Fml why'd I have to find it? I actually got a tiny bit of sleep last night and even though it was in tiny increments and restless as fuck it was a super great sign. This morn I ate for the 1st time in 3 or 4 days bc I can't eat in wds and then when I think of something I can eat it's something we don't have or I can't afford. There's absolutely nothing here to eat but I found a decent size power bar and ate it. I know it isn't much but when it's literally been like 4 days with 0 food it made me feel much better. 
              I'm not usually the type to forget any of my drugs at all but I'd had a few good come ups and was going balls out so extremely I forgot a fucking .3 in another pair of pants. Right as I'm making my way thru the end of the withdrawal tunnel and into the light of being well. It's crazy how stuff works out sometimes. Now that I did a nice shot I realize I'm hungry af and need to eat. So that will be my goal for today lol find some way for food. I wish it could've been 1 of you guys who found dope it honestly is terrible for me. I'd almost made it. I'm going to do it all today and see how bad it's set me back. How are all of you doing? I hope everyone is well and happy.

Could you just put some iso alcohol on it to kill any bacteria, then evaporate the iso alcohol, and shoot it without any worry of cotton fever? And also, iso alcohol wont leave any residue after it evaporates that could harm you if injected, correct?

I got 2 kinds of dopes in my gram a few days ago. Half of it was grey powder and tiny pebbles of dope that id been getting for a week now, and the other half was one chunk of similar looking grey dope. I didnt even notice the chunk was different until i got home and cut a piece off the chunk, put it in the spoon, and put water on it.

So,  with all the bad shit and even dope thats cut with synthetic pot that makes you trip balls horribly, i just didnt even feel like testing the new shit till the morning at least and did the shit i knew was good. 

I heated it slowly several times and evaporated 95% of the water that was in the spoon, then let the last bit evaporate on its own so i didnt burn the dope. I tried it and the new shit was also good, so now im to where i gotta do the 2 fat shots left in the spoon in the morning.  Im probably good to just do it, but i really don't wanna get cotton fever ever again in my life. I should be cool to squirt some iso alcohol in it, let it completely evaporate over an hour or so, then put water on it and shoot it, right?

Only the shell of who I once was is reminiscent, depicted by this strange character who goes trough life pretending. 

Just Like a newborn chick escapes the hard walls of a broken egg, my soul had escaped my worn out body. 

In my eyes was an empty stare. As empty as the emotions in my still, somehow beating heart. 

Like an apocalyptic zombie from a fictional novel, I went trough life. Never being noticed, I desperately and silently screamed for help, without ever being heard. 

The seemingly never ending struggle would dramatically come to end like a play with a plot twist; the realization that The Dragon was chasing me.

Thick layers of warmth, creeping slowly up the length of my broken body
consuming me at once, erasing all introverted feelings of torment

Agony; despair; self-hatred

All quickly diminished with the steady burn of a dancing flame, a deep, lasting breath, inviting the ultimate escape

Sliding down the glistening smooth, silver surface, releasing a deathly beautiful swirl of creamy, irresistible bliss

Temptation takes over

Slowly and carefully, I inhale, inhale as if it's my last breath; yearning for this ecstasy to continue forever

Spectacular bitter smoke curls into my open mouth, finding its way to my eager lungs

i hold my breath, my hazel eyes closed gently to block out anything that could possibly interrupt this perfect moment

Seconds later, I exhale, my tense body suddenly relaxed and my heavy eyelids flutter open, only a ghost escaping my lips

The feeling is sublime

Dark shadows of my past- regret, shame, mania, confusion...

The weight is instantly lifted and replaced by pure and utter enjoyment

No longer am I overwhelmed with such intense sadness

No longer am I so submerged in dwelling on the past

No worrying about the future

There is here and there is now, and that is all there is

It is euphoria.",1537579926.0

Anymore than if insulin was made illegal tomorrow and certain diabetics couldn't get permission slips and had to do desperate shit and deal with the black market would make them ""insulin addicts"" while the ones with permission slips were simply ""insulin dependent"". No. You're still the same. One group is just a more obvious victim of prohibition.

But yeah, back to the self-described ""legitimate pain patients"".

The ones who hate on other opiate takers seem to be mostly middle aged women (not hating on middle aged women in any way, this has just been my experience).

Like bitch you take 8 oxy 30s a day for your fibromyalgia and you're just a ""dependent patient"".

While my friend who takes 4 30s a day for his treatment resistant suicidal depression and is the only medicine that allows him to function is an ""abuser addict"" all because he doesn't have a fucking piece of paper with some scribbles on it?

The funny thing is he could easily get a fibro diagnosis and then magically overnight he'd go from being this lady's sworn enemy to a fellow pain sufferer.

Basically it seems like a ""I got mine, fuck everyone else"" attitude with these people.

And I have some serious fucking chronic pain issues. So it makes me sick when people lose access to opiates.

But these types can eat a dick.

Sorry for the long rant.

I just see these types ALL OVER!

Basically what it comes down to is ""addiction, abuse, etc."" are all legal definitions that appeal to authority.

The definition of ""addict"" or ""abuser"" essentially comes down to non-government approved medicating.

After all, cigarette smokers, insulin takers, antidepressent users, etc. aren't called ""drug addicts"" who need to be forced into ""treament"" for their ""drug abuse"".

Add to the fact that all the problems blamed on ""illegal opiate use"" are 100% caused by prohibiton, and the distinction becomes a joke.

After all, if you lived in the UK and had a pure heroin prescription that cost you $20/week you would have NONE of the problems blamed on so-called ""addiction"".

You would simply live a normal life and people literally couldn't tell the difference between the clear liquid in your rig and the clear liquid in a diabetic's.

So, in conclusion, this is really a plea to my fellow chronic pain sufferers.

Realize that all opiate takers are in this together and that the prohibition of opiates by definition hurts us all.

We've all had that doctor (or dozen!) that doesn't ""believe"" our pain is ""real"".

Which is why we have the phrase - Pain is what the person says it is.

So stop letting the government win by using its age old divide and conquer strategy on us.

We're ALL adults and have the right to take whatever medicine WE as INDIVIDUALS see fit. 

Hopefully one day this right is recognized again and prescription laws are abolished.

None of us is any more ""legitimate"" than anyone else.

Imagine if the cannabis movement had let infighting between so-called ""medicinal"" and so-called ""recreational"" groups consume them?

Would you be able to walk into a store and buy cannabis OTC today like you can in some states if the cannabis movement spent its time arguing over who was a ""legitimate"" cannabis taker?

Of course not!

And neither should we who take opiates!

We're all humans. What we have in common is that we consume poppy plant matter. We need to stick together to undo the damage caused by the last 100 years of opiophobia instead of letting our opposition tear us apart.

Thank you!

Peace!",1537577518.0

I’ve been wanting to get clean for a while now since I don’t get much out of using anymore. I only use so that I’m not sick and am able to go to work and care for my daughter.   I didn’t know where to turn to for recovery, so I just followed in my friends footsteps and went to a Suboxone clinic. The doctor was very professional and informative. Patients in the lobby raved about him as well as people as well as online. I’m not sure if this is the best way to handle my addiction, but whatever, I guess we’ll see

I’m fortunate enough to make enough money to pay for all my bills, daycare, and every day expenses. Paycheck advance apps have also been helping me when needed recently. I am completely over this life tho...staying well being  my main job, and my actual job is just what brings in money along with a few other hustles. Tired of it.

 I use about 1-1.3g of heroin every day. I’m a snorter. Never thought about shooting and don’t have any plans to ever do it. Since I use everyday and have for a few years without stopping, I haven’t had to go thru WDs very much. This is what kind of scares me. I just finished my last line and I feel very committed to not use again.

So, I have my prescription ready...not 100% sure if I will even use it when it’s time to but I’m ready. The doctor said to wait 36-48 hours if I remember if correctly, so the plan is to take my first sub around 12PM-6PM EST on Sunday 9/13. WDs are gonna be hell right? Right...

I don’t remember why I even decided to post this. Anyways...fellow guys and gals...I’m pretty nervous and that’s all that’s on my mind now. Let me know what y’all think...should keep me distracted throughout the night . Hopefully I can sleep tonight. 

Oh yeah btw, this is my first attempt at “getting clean”. Never been to any sort of rehab, doctor, program or been on any medication like Suboxone before.

It's going pretty well, haven't missed or OD'd yet. I have one question though, I hope it's not too noob-ish.

Sometimes I slip out of the vein, I notice it pretty quickly because I re-register as often as possible. When that happens, I can usually find the vein again by pushing the needle in a little further or (occasionally) going back a little. Are you supposed to do it like that or should you pull out entirely and start over? I think the latter might cause more trauma to the vein because you're making a bunch of holes, but the former solution might cause you to widen the hole. I definitely don't ""wiggle"" the needle around, i.e. the angle stays the same and it's just a back-and-forth movement.

This past weekend he said he tossed his methadone away because he knew it made me uncomfortable (which is not the case, the lying, secrecy, and abusing it with other substances that won't show up on a drug panel is what is bothering me). Said he started going through withdrawal. Around hour 72 he started having... what almost looked like seizures.

Hey guys I figured now is the time to share one of my craziest stories of doing/buying drugs in the hood.

So a few years ago I had just switched to subs after a year of dope. This was because all the dope when to shit and was hardly heroin at all. Anyway the subs gave me bad side effects such as insomnia, jaw tension and anxiety and my dope dealer also had xanax so I would see him for that every once in a while.

One day i went to see him and he had me park in the middle of the fucking hood in a parking lot of a dilapidated store. I was waiting there for about 20 mins when some guy who was probably in his mid twenties pulls up next to me and says hey you need bars? And i say how did you know? and he says ""you dont look like a dope junky and your white"" and i say ""oh thanks"" and he offers me 4 for twenty which was a much better deal then i would have gotten. So i buy them and he smoked me down on a blunt while drinking lean lol

Fast forward 2 months him and I actually become good friends and he would ask me for rides around town and smoke me down on tons of blunts and give me free bars all day. He also liked xan but his main thing was lean. He went by kurt. one day he introduces me to his girlfriend and she says ""im still so scared from the last time you got shot"" and i ask him ""you got shot?"" and hes like yea a few times actually. The first time hit his thigh and he had a bullet scar there. Then he was driving down the main road one day in the hood and had his car light up and one bullet fucked up his hand. He didnt go to the hospital for that one and his hand had a nasty scar on it. Then he got shot in the back a and you could feel the bullet if you touched his upper chest next to his fucking heart. The doctors couldn't remove the bullet as it was too close to the heart.

I also meet some of his gang friends we smoked a few blunts in a little shitty park in the hood just me and 4 big black dudes must have looked ridiculous it was a blast.

So one day he hits me up and says he fucked up making crack because he added baking powder instead of baking soda. He says he needs to bring it across town to a trap I say dont wanna drive with a big jar of coke water in my car he sys hell give me a few bars and well smoke and talks me into it. I drive him across town and he gets it fixed. then we take some xans and smoke and get back in my car to go somewhere else. all of a sudden he yells at me to turn down a sketchy alley. I do and then he tells me to turn down an even worse one. now i'm thinking hes gonna steal my car with the gun i know he has in his pants.

I ask him whats going on and he says the cops saw him and i was about to get pulled over and to give him my glass bowl and anything else illegal i had. luckily i didn't have anything else. He takes them and runs away. I pull out of the alley to be surrounded by 4 cop cars 2 of which say ""gangs drugs and guns task force"" on the cars. I stop and 6 cops run at my car guns drawn yelling. Im on fucking xanax and a bit belligerent and laugh. when they see im alone they yell ""Where the fuck is he hes a known drug dealer where the fuck is he?"" me being on the xan say ""i have no clue what you are talking about i've been driving around alone all day sightseeing in your beautiful city"" (were in a fucking ghetto). They pull me out the car and say ""If we dont find dope in the car you can go"" and they rip apart my car find nothing and let me fucking leave.

On my way home kurt call and says ""good job come back i got your bowl"" and im like im going home ill seeya in a few days.",1537549009.0

9hrigm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9hrigm/not_always_an_inmate_but_forever_a_convict/,4,https://redd.it/9hrigm,concentratedgarbage,Not always an inmate but forever a convict.,"Arnold once told me that even though he wasn’t an inmate, he would forever be a convict.  Maybe that’s why I reached out to one of Tim’s best friends that he made while locked up these passed six years. “Listen, I know you don’t know me outside of what Tim has said and the few times we’ve spoken on the phone but I need a person who knows people.” 

I need a person who knows junkies. I’m too pretty, too addicted, and too white to do any type of hustling in the big city without getting robbed. I might be a scumbag but I’m not an idiot. 

Tim and Jason stayed in touch after Jason got released a year ago. I’ve gotten to know him a bit as he reached out to my mother and I after his release and said he loved Tim and would do whatever he could to help us with him. I’ve always had a good judge of character and I immediately liked Jason the first time I talked to him on the phone. He looked out for Tim that first year they were together.  Tim was a baby and Jason had about fifteen years on him. They were fast friends when they first met in a Texas Gladiator School six years ago. Jason was on his second stay in TDCJ and helped Tim fight when he first went in at age 19. They shared an entire year together and then one more 8 month stint before Jason got his freedom again a year ago. Jason looked out for the baby boy while we all adjusted to prison life in that first year. I’m forever in his debt. Now that Arnold is dead and left me all this dope, I knew I needed to find another convict to help me finish off the junkie life and finally stay clean. 

Jason listens quietly to me as my voice shakes a bit while spitting out those words. “What’s on your mind, young lady? Why do you need a person who knows people? Better yet, why do you need an ex-convict who knows people?” Jason has a southern twang to his voice that reminds me of home. “Well, it seems I’ve come into a bit of a pickle.” I went on to tell Jason everything about the black bag, and my utter incompetence for actually making money with them. 

“Sounds like you need to drop the Blue Bell Ice cream idea of eat all you can and sell the rest little lady! Your brother would shit if he knew I was even exchanging more than a hello with his big baby sister.” “He can’t know about this. Jason, can you help me or not?” I feel light as a feather talking to him. He tells me I did the right thing. He can get rid of them for me. He knows people. He knows junkies. “I’ll be in town in two weeks. I’ll call you for your address. It will be late” I tell him. I make sure he knows I’m not afraid to come to his dwelling and do business with him. 

Jason sighs, “You’re gonna have to trust me. You know I’ve fucked over better people than you in my life?” I think it’s cute that Jason is trying to make sure I know I’m playing a big game. “I didn’t reach out to you because I thought your word was good. I reached out to you because I need to get rid of a large number of pills and make some quick cash before my life falls apart. It would do me good to get fucked over for once anyway.” Jason laughs, “you know, Tim talked about you all the time. He told me once if I ever met you I’d know why he was the way he was. I see it now. I’m not sure if the right sibling went to prison.” “Fuck you Jason” I laughed. I can hear him smile through the phone, “ This bonds us for life, ya know? We’re family now. I fucked over a lot of people in my life but never my family.” “That’s fine, Jason. I’ll see you in two weeks.” 

I look down at my phone and me and Jason had talked for over an hour. A small pang of guilt hits my sober brain. Jason has been out exactly a year. I slithered into his life in the first year of his freedom. I hope I’m not why he ends up going back. If so, at least I’ll have another set of eyes on the baby boy again. That thought is where I sit now, typing this out. Cheers to the next two weeks. The monkey on my back is starting to get heavier. ",1537546751.0

The first one must have been around 50, worked a good job, had a wife / kids and lived in a nice, quiet suburb. He also moved thousands of OC80's a month, this guy was *way* up the oxy chain. Once I earned his trust by buying through the dark web (back before SR, it's what us OG's called Source Boards) for a while he eventually just let me come to his house. It was great; I'd text / ring ahead, either pick up cash on the way or bank transfer it to him, park up outside and he'd be straight out. Perfect.

But as so many stories go, oxy started to get pretty expensive. I was paying £20 for an 80, and when you're going through 3+ in a day the bill starts to add up *quick*.  
So I went out and found myself what I thought was a heroin dealer, but I would later learn was a shitty middle. The guy would have me drive over, pick him up, drive to the spot (but park at such an angle that I couldn't see what door it was), wait for him to go in, grab the gear then come back out. Turns out he was literally doubling the price, so if I wanted 4 £10 bags I'd have to give him £80. I knew he was ripping me off, he knew I knew, but every time I'd complain he'd always lie, then say ""if you don't like the price, go somewhere else"".  
Thankfully my luck changed one day when he showed up drunk and without enough credit to make the call. He used my phone, forgets to delete the number and I swoop in the next day to start buying direct.  
This guy was amazing, he'd sell from his house (although he moved every ~2 months to keep old bill off his trail), sold great gear and had no problem with me buying weight. He'd always weigh it out in front of me too, so I knew I was actually getting my moneys worth rather than just buying a load of £10 bags.

Unfortunately all good things must come to an end, and when I moved back down South I had to start the hunt for a good dealer again.  
I spent a while in this new town and was never that impressed with any of the 5+ dealers I had - long waits, short bags, quality was never consistent etc etc.  
I recently moved back to my hometown and got in touch with these 2 girls, a couple that used to run a trap near me. We'd always got on well; I'd helped them move house in exchange for a few bags, driven them to appointments occasionally etc, so there was definitely some trust there. Turns out the main one got nicked and has been inside for a while / will be for a while longer. But the other one, a sober girl that was really only in it for the cash / because her gf was a heavy user offered to hook me up with someone she knew. She told me this person is super picky about who they sell to, so I better not fuck up and maker her look bad for recommending me.  
She introduces me and my god, it's like having my old Northern dealer back! Huge bags of consistently good gear, decent prices and best of all there's basically no waiting. Compared to the trash that other local guys are selling this is amazing.

Can't believe my luck to land a *third* amazing dealer, happy fukken days boys!!",1537541460.0

9hq8kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9hq8kc/rip_cuz/,2,https://redd.it/9hq8kc,bazerov,RIP cuz’,"my cousin finally ODd two days ago. We knew it was coming sooner or later, but it still sucks. He was 34 years old and he left a young son behind (albeit estranged). He blamed the world, the courts, his ex, and her new bf for his predicament. There was no other perspective. It’s easy to see this in others. It’s difficult to see it in ourselves. 

I was 9 when my aunt brought him home from the hospital. We grew up together for a while and did the stuff kids do; built forts, played video-games, watched a ton of movies. We laughed a lot. 

Then we drifted into our own sordid drug sagas. I got clean first, then he did, then we took turns relapsing. He had legal troubles, while I never did. We never used together until last June (I wanted to terminate my last ‘relapse’) knowing that he was on a run too (having just come off probation). we got a brick apiece and blew through that in 36 hours... his tolerance was almighty. 

It sucks that the last time I saw him we were using together, but at least I got to spend time with him. However, I could tell that he wasn’t long for this world. No sense of harm reduction whatsoever. I finished my brick and left him there in squalor.

Now he’s gone. 

I reached out to him from treatment and also afterwards. I tried to mention him doing the same, but he was on his own path (of destruction). 

I wanted to write something somewhere about him. You guys know what I mean. Civilians don’t get it. A friend recently likened it to a plague... as if The Walking Dead is actually happening. We’ve become inured to these deaths, and the dead are simply forgotten. All his son will know is that his dad was a junky. That he didn’t care about him. That’s the farthest from the truth. I think we care too much. We want it all fixed right now. Then when shit doesn’t work out, we go back to the last thing that worked...

I’m rambling.

So I've slowly reduced down to 0.4mg of buprenorphine every day from 4mg 18 months ago or so. I'm struggling to take it properly every day and it's become a bit of an addiction in itself so I'm ready to stop taking it altogether. I'm not sure why but when I snort my dose it does get me a nice buzz. Not ""high"" as such, but I definitely get a nice mellow slightly opiated feeling and a bit of drowsiness. I'm guessing I got on subs too eagerly or maybe I'm just naturally susceptible to their effects. But either way I'm a little anxious about how bad withdrawals will be because they effect me even at such a low dose.

My keyworker seems to think that 0.4mg is nothing and I should be fine, and I hope he's right, but I've heard some horror stories. It varies a lot I'm guessing, some people say they've come off at >=1mg without too many withdrawals while others say coming off even 0.2mg was hard.

I've got myself 3.5g of weed and 10\*10mg diazepam tablets. Does weed help with withdrawals much? I would guess it makes the anxiety a lot worse, so I got the diazepam for that. Obviously I won't take it for more than a week max. It will be the first time in years I'll be without some kind of opiate in my system so I'm kinda nervous. I guess I'm mostly asking if I'll feel many withdrawals *(edit: More than 5 withdrawals and I'm done lol)* and how well the weed and Valium will help, but I know it's not something anyone can be accurate about, just wondered if anyone had any advice or encouraging experiences.

Thanks :)

Bonus unrelated question: Should you capitalise drug names? I mean if they're brand names sure, but buprenorphine? Buprenorphine? diazepam or Diazepam? I'd guess they're proper nouns so I think I'll capitalise in the future.",1537534674.0

Beth’s mouth hangs open, and her gaze is fixed on me as I talk on the phone.
	
She’s got these brittle little pebble teeth set far apart from one another in her gums. They’re not particularly crooked or stacked in rows like some people’s, but they’re definitely not straight. Don’t get me wrong. She’s pretty. Her big brown eyes and thin face work really will with the way she keeps her hair, which is short. She’s just had her struggles with drugs in life and like the rest of us, our teeth give us away. I run my tongue along the jagged crater in one of my own teeth. 

 
When we first started hanging out, Beth used to wear these cheap falsies that were always falling out and separating from her eyelids. She even used to have her nails all done up and wore those dumb three hundred-dollar pairs of jeans with all that bling on the back pockets. You know the ones I’m talking about, right? But not anymore. I think it was because she’d just gotten sober and her best friend from the rehab she’d been in was into all of that. It never seemed to fit on Beth. Anyway, by the time she had her baby, that other girl had moved on to someone else and Beth went back to wearing the Pink Floyd shirts and green army jackets and cheap second-hand jeans with the frayed heels and old skater shoes. All of that is more her style. 

Her fingernails are bleedy, ragged nubs which tells me she’s using, again. She’s chewing one now. The child is smashing one of her toys against the table and making snotty noise with her mouth. I’m not sure how bad Beth’s using, but I’m about to find out. 

Sal asks me how many I want on the phone. He never told me how much they cost, so I just tell him that I’ve got 120 bucks. Beth licks her bottom lip and leans forward, while Sal says he’ll give me a deal over the phone. He tells me to call him back in ten minutes to find out where to go. 

I hang up, and she asks, 

“Who’s that?”

“Sal.”

“Do I know him?”

“You should. He’s tall. Got black hair. You don’t know Sal? He goes to meetings. Well, he was going to meetings for like the last two years. You’ve seen him.”

“I don’t know.”

“He’s got the limp and his right arm is all beat back.”

She shakes her head.

“Dee Dee is his girlfriend. You know the one with the blond hair and crazy green eyes. She’s always going off at the meetings about her dad and how he molested her growing up and all of that.”

“Oh, yeah! So, her boyfriend?”

“That’s the story.”

“He’s working?” There’s a quiver in her voice. 

“Mmhmm.” 

“What’re you gonna get?”

“What do you think I’m gonna get, Beth?”

“Dope.”

“Good guess.” 

“Yeah. Well, I didn’t know you were using. I thought you were going on like two years, here soon. What about that?”

“Not now.” I shrug. “He’s about to call back. Are you wanting in on this or what?”

Beth looks at the kid. She looks back up at me. “Yeah. I’ll give you a ride.” 
	      
	

	
12

A melon headed kid collects shopping carts in the Fred Meyer’s parking lot.


Beth is sitting in the driver’s seat. She is gripping the steering wheel and pulling herself forward and holding her breath. She wears a maroon knit cap. Her kid is in the back in a car seat eating Goldfish from a plastic cup. The interior has been plastered with thrown food items and the multicolored paste of saliva soggy cereal. It gives the car a distinct smell, the way hamster cages have that distinct smell but different. You know, the mixture of bedding and food and the different biological excretions all mixed together in a poorly ventilated container? 
	
My phone rings. I answer. Sal tells me he’s at the Starbuck’s and will be out in a minute. I tell him we’re in a brown Civic with a grey door and hood by the outdoor section. Only a few minutes pass before he’s jumping into the back seat and sitting next to the baby. I pull out my money. Sal shows me a rubber band wrapped number of the same D.O.A. baggies from the day before, but they’re all inside of another bigger baggie. 
	
“Look. There’s 16 bags in there. I’m a do you right if you keep bringing me money.”
	
“Okay.” I say.
	
“Try to get 200 if you can. I’ll give you 30 bags. So what ya think? Fire right?”
	
“Oh yeah. Just wanna see what it’s like when I shoot it.”
	
“Bags are ten a piece from me. My boys told me I need to be giving deals and get people working under me. It’s 14 for 100. 30 for 200. Like I said they’re ten a piece from me, but I bet you can get 15 or even 20 around here. Even at ten, though, you’re making a pretty stash for yourself. Hit me up. You got my number.”
	
“Aight. Sounds good, yo.” I clap my hands and rock forward in my seat. 
	
Before Sal gets out, he does that cocky thing where dudes throw their chin back at Beth. He asks her what she’s doing with the Junky Vonnegut. She looks at me frowning and shrugging.
	
“What?”
	
“You never told her?” Sal asks.
	
“There’s nothing to tell her.” I say. 
	
“Now there is. Tell me.” Beth says.
	
“It’s nothing. Stupid.” I say.
	
“So, when I was in rehab with this guy,” he points to me with his lips and his chin, “Your boy, here, he was always running around with this book in his hand.”
	
“What book?” She asks.
	
“What is it called, again?” Sal asks me.
	
“Breakfast of Champions. The best book ever written.” I say plainly.
	
“Yeah, The Breakfast of Champions. Haha. This guy tells me he wants to be a writer and that he’s obsessed with the author of the book.”
	
Beth looks back and forth at us. She doesn’t get it. “So?”
	
“So, the guy’s name is Vonnegut, right?”
	
“Yeah. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.” I say.
	
“Yeah. That. Anyway. I say to him, maybe you can’t be this guy but you can be like the Junky Vonnegut or something. Everyone called him the Junky Vonnegut that. He was so crazy. It took him three weeks to start wearing shoes.” Sal laughs. “You never told her about that?”
	
“No.” 

Sal can’t understand why. He shakes his head and laughs some more. We bump knuckles. He tells Beth his name and asks for hers. Then, he opens the door, closes it and limps away.  I pull the stash out and take the rubber band off and hand one to Beth. She holds it up to her nose and inhales with her eyes closed. She moans. 

“The Junky Vonnegut, huh?” She rolls her eyes.

“Yeah.”

“Stupid.”
	
“I know. What I said. I don’t think he even gets that it’s an inside joke.”

She nods.

“You got works?” I ask.
	
“No.” She says. “I got a few bucks, though.” Beth gets out and jogs for the door closest to the pharmacy. The toddler looks at me and reaches out to give me a few soggy Goldfish.

Beth sings with the radio all the way back to her place. 	

	
Except for a few minutes when she parks outside of her sister’s place and takes the kid inside to leave with her for a few hours. There’s silence for a bit, but when she gets back in the car, Hotel California is playing. Beth sings the lyrics passionately and plays some air drums. She even does the guitar solos with her mouth. It’s pretty terrible, but she’s excited about the dope we got, and I kind of have myself to blame for her singing. I told her she was a good singer once. I can’t remember what song it was playing when I did, but it was sadder and softer and she had more control of her voice. Now, she blows notes that are flat and out of key at the top of her lungs and looks at me, wiggling her eyebrows and striking diva poses for a laugh. She thinks I like it. I smile back at her.
	
	
When we make it up the stairs to her apartment, she gets a glass of water and two spoons. I toss my pack of smokes onto the coffee table and the bag with the other baggies inside of it. I pull my sweatshirt and shirt over my head and toss it on the couch next to me.  Beth and I have never done drugs together. We know a lot of the same people, but our knowledge of each other is strictly chemical free.

 
Getting high with someone for the first time is a special thing. It’s like the first time a girl undresses for you with the lights on and you see the things you've never seen or that time your uptight math teacher with the crucifix and long skirts put on some jeans and cut up with the other teachers on a field trip to the local wildlife preserve, like it’s a different person altogether. And Beth delivers. It is every bit as intimate as making love.


We drop water onto the powder in our spoons. We suck it up into our syringes. She wears a stained white tank top and wipes the crook of her arm with an alcohol swab. Beth pulls the looped leather belt tight before she starts poking herself. There are already a few bruises and red specked freckles in the crook of her arm. The skin on mine only has the purple, leathery divot of old scar tissue. My vein is fat beneath that. The needle is sharp. A black blood flower blooms in my syringe and disappears. 


I swallow hard. She sighs with hard lungs right behind me. Then, we sit in silence, letting the tingle crush us, our arms and legs and shoulders and necks. I lean back on the couch and throw my hands up above my head. It’s hazy after that. We sleep. The womb of our goddess is warm. We are birthed back into the world, only to have her bear us once more in her belly. We slumber. We suckle at our mother’s bosom. She is all that we need. She is all that we want.

I’m gonna write about the most recent one. 

I was being really stupid, and don’t know why I did, but I decided it’d be a good idea to combine Oxycodone, Xanax, and Alcohol. 

(VERY DANGEROUS COMBO DO NOT EVER DO THIS) 

To start the day I had 3 1/2, 2mg Pharmaceutical xans, and 20mg of Oxycodone. I took 2mg Xanax when I woke up and went and bought 6, 24 oz steel reserves. I skated through my city, stumbling upon a church after awhile and snorting 5mg Oxy and popping the other half. 

I then kept skating towards the river, I got there and found a homeless camp and kinda just barged in. I asked if they smoked and we smoked some weed and I offered them a beer and gave em a couple bucks and snorted my other oxy. We drank a beer, I think I was on my second 24 oz at this point.

After this I was pretty fucked. I ate shit on my skateboard a handful of times and was bleeding all over. I think I popped another xan around this time, this is when it starts getting hazy. I was just going along the river and found a rope swing and being in the idiotic state I was in I thought it’d be a good idea so I took my shirt off and swung in a few times. I was soaking wet and broke my brand new phone. 

I let myself dry out while drinking another beer. At this point I was on 4mg Xanax, 20mg oxy, and 3, 24oz 8% beers.
It hadn’t really all kicked in yet so I managed to skate down to the skatepark and passed out somewhere in the grass. Someone found me after I don’t know how long and apparently couldn’t wake me at all, I eventually did wake up and was SOOOO groggy and fucked. I was slurring so hard I literally couldn’t form words or stand at all and they called an ambulance. I don’t remember this part at all from starting from when I got to the skatepark, I woke up in the hospital and there were 3 beers left and 1 xan that they took so I ended up taking 5mg Xanax along with lots of alcohol on top of opiates. I feel like I probably wasn’t THAT far from death. Especially because I could’ve easily taken the last xan and drank more which might’ve done it. This scared me for about 3 days but today I picked up some oxys so that’s out the window. Definently keeping my distance from benzos though and recommend everyone do the same. 

I guess the reason I’m writing this is because I just want to vent and share the story while I still somewhat remember it. And also want to warn others of this combo. It’s no joke. It wasn’t scary at the time because I was on Xanax but level of fucked up I was scares me. And I know I’m a dumbass.

Dosing misconceptions?,"So the bioavailability of morphine taken orally is in the ~30% range. 
Hydrocodone, its bioavailability is in the ~70% range.

According to equivalency charts of their potencies, they are compared at a 1:1 strength. 

My question about this:
*is 30mg of Oral Morphine equal to 30mg of Hydrocodone, for example?*

The reason I ask this is because I’ve noticed a lot of people on our home here on r/opiates claim that “taking oral morphine is a complete waste”, but I hear nothing similar about Hydrocodone. 

So the confusion sets in: Would 200mg of morphine taken orally, at its 30% bioavailability, be comparable to roughly 100mg of Hydrocodone taken orally? 

Or is more or so:
200mg of Morphine oral comparable to 200mg of Hydrocodone oral?

Thanks guys/gals, a factual answer to this question will help me —and others here— make informed decisions of dosing properly.",1537478878.0

I still wifed her tho (5 min read with TL/DR).","Requested by u/lilymminx & a few others. 

Well, I met my (later to be) wife, through mutual friends (as you do) when I was 23 and was a fresh faced medical school graduate who was doing a rotation through the ER in the town I lived in then. This is part of the process to becoming a doctor who is able to practice with full (not provisional) registration. 

So we were going steady after a few months, things were going well for me at work, the stress of medical school was behind me, I had clear road ahead & was really enjoying plying my trade and putting into practice what I had learned at uni. 

In hindsight, there were red flags pretty much from day one. Things I should’ve seen but didn’t, feelings I had but ignored. 

Things such as after our first proper date, I drove her home, and after I’d seen her inside and stolen a kiss, got back in my car and couldn’t find my bottle of dexamfetamine. I didn’t think too much of it, but I *always* carry it with me everywhere I go. Have done since a kid. I knew I had it at dinner, but figured it fell out of my pocket. 

After a few months, we moved in together. It’s kinda hard to keep things seperate when you share a bed and a bathroom, and she did ask if she could have a few of my pills and while I didn’t say “sure” it was a “turn a blind eye thing” so, she went to fucking town.

Now I should say at this point (we’ll never meet and this is all anonymous) that Louise has Borderline Personality Disorder AND Bipolar 2. So that’s where the insane outbursts, idealisation, “I’ll do anything for you as long as you love me, but if you try to leave, I’ll kill you” & lack of impulse control and a desire to “dull the pain” comes in. And after 6 months, yeah I did love her. 

We were building a life together nothing could go wrong! 

*Narrator* “in fact soon, *everything* would go wrong”

So being a doc, I kept a prescription pad at home, and you know, I was practicing at a hospital. Fuck did I need a prescription pad for? It’s all done on the hospital computers & special hospital prescription pads in the ER. 

So I thought my pad would be safer in my bedside table, I mean after all, who the fuck is gonna get to it there?

Apparently, Louise (not her real name btw). 

I didn’t realise this until MUCH later in our relationship but poor Louise had substance abuse issues (as many with Borderline Personality Disorder do) and had been in rehab once or twice (4 actually) times. Her parents are wealthy and they paid for the best, but it never took. 

Anyway, it turned out that she had snuck a few of my prescriptions out of my pad, to see if I’d notice. I mean fuck, those things have a hundred pages, I never looked at it because I never used it and even if I did, who’d notice? 

So the crafty minx has been practicing my signature over a few months (something that would save my bacon later) and by this stage she was pretty good at it. So she started writing prescriptions for her DOC’s (opioids and benzos). 

She started off small with scripts for morphine that certainly seemed reasonable. Had greed not gotten the better of her, perhaps no one would’ve ever found out. 

A few times I came home from work to find her fucked up. And I mean completely, totally out of it. I walk in “honey I’m home” and she’s on the bed, drooling, unrousable and snoring like a hog. 

Of course, I go into full fucking doctor mode, checking her vitals, etc, and come to the conclusion an ambulance isn’t necessary. So I stay up all night with her (where are nurses for 15 minute obs when you need ‘em?) Next morning she says she got some Xanax off her friend and obviously took too many (no shit). 

I told her not to do shit like that again and that was the end of it. 

Few more instances like that, each time “it won’t happen again”. It annoyed me, but it wasn’t every fucking day and we were hot for each other and talking marriage. You know, you’re young, in love, you overlook a lot of shit. 

One day I get a call from (we have a new body now called AHPRA that deals with a lot of this stuff, but we still have our colleges etc) the Medical Council along the lines of “Hey Dr Platinum_Tower, would you be able to come and see us on this date at this address for a chat?” 

Sure I say, thinking this is about my provisional registration or something. Perfectly normal thinks I. No complaints from the hospital, all my feedback (well the majority) was good, I’d grown professionally & considerably in my skills. 

So, I rock up in my suit, for a friendly chat and I noticed the mood was distinctly frosty “that’s odd” I thought, but took a seat. 

Then I was asked if I knew why I was there? No siree bob says I. 

Then they laid out about 50 scripts. “Recognise these?” have a quick look, ummm not really, then I look at the prescribing doctor. Yup Dr Platinum_Tower with what looks like a good facsimile of my signature, not perfect, but pretty damn close. 

My heart sank. But I actually thought (naievely that someone I’d maybe treated at hospital had gotten my name and stolen a script pad and I was just the unfortunate doc they picked).

Then I realised “how would they know my signature?” (my REAL signature, not the scribble I use in professional settings). 

Then I thought, who would have access to a prescription pad and know my signat....ohh shit. 

Now the thing is, a blank prescription pad on its own isn’t particularly useful, sure you can write shit on there, but you have to know the conventions and rules (such as scripts for heavily controlled we call em Schedule 8) scripts can only have ONE item per script. You can’t have “Morphine AND Oxycodone” on one script, or its invalid. If you need to write both, you gotta do two seperate scripts. 

Also unless you know the prescriber number etc, it’s not much use to you. Obviously, being my fucking gf/fiancée at the time, she knew ALL my professional credentials & what to write (prescriber number etc not medical abbreviations etc). 

My heart sank and I thought I was gonna vomit. I cast my mind over the scripts a bit closer. OxyContin 80mg, Morphine 100mg, Fentanyl patches, Xanax 2mg, Lorazepam 2.5mg, Temazepam, Flunitrazepam, Diazepam, if there was a benzo I could’ve scripted, Louise scripted it. 

The amazing thing (I mean truly mind boggling) was that she had been obtaining prescriptions (in her name) for INJECTABLE forms of opioids. Some fucking pharmacist filled injectable opioids outside a hospital pharmacy setting!  

I mean *they* should be struck off for that, that’s so far out there, I can’t imagine how they thought that was legit. Given it was probably written with a kindergarten level of medical knowledge and zero understanding of medical terms. 

I can’t imagine a script for something like “Ketamine (the big doses) as needed through needle” or whatever the fuck Louise put on it sailing through unquestioned, but there you have it. 

Not for use by a doctor, but for self administration. I mean, Morphine Sulfate, (she managed a script for Ketamine which she said was for a friend) and drugs that have NO place outside a hospital. 

I was really worried about the IV stuff, but she assured me they were for friends who knew what she was doing. I to this day believe her (15 years later & older and wiser).  

The working assumption was that I had been prescribing them to a woman / women I was fucking in exchange for sex or cash. 

I pretty quickly realised what had gone on and had to explain everything. We were living together, we’re gonna get married she has BPD. 

It apparently isn’t unheard of for family members to steal a script, but this was unprecedented. Louises eventual undoing was presenting a script twice at the same chemist, a couple of days apart, with different names, to the same pharmacist, and both scripts had medical errors on them (and were for frankly outrageous quantities if memory serves). 

She wasn’t familiar with certain terms, and the pharmacist got suss, called the line to report dodge scripts and then ALL of the scripts “I” had written came out. 

She needed to give a statutory declaration that I wasn’t involved, I was given a damn good talking too and it was (thank you Baby Jesus) decided it would be handled administratively with our State Government health authorities with remedial training for me about “prescription pad safety” or some shit. 

Believe it or not, most health agencies DON’T want to see doctors deregistered for mistakes or even borderline criminal conduct, they spend a lot of time training us and want us to be around for 50+ years. Plus there’s always a doctor shortage. 

I got my full registration (obviously) and no police involvement was deemed necessary (thank fuck this was in the days we could keep shit totally in house if we felt like it in medical boards and state health authorities). 

It was made clear to me that it was (basically) because we were getting married. I’m under no illusions if it was just some chick I was banging, she would’ve been practically frogmarched into a police station. 

She was able to keep the scripts “below the PBS government radar” because she was writing the scripts as “private prescriptions”. This means the government doesn’t subsidise the medication, so you have to pay full price for the script, but no one in government knows about it. 

I also found out I was paying for them too as we had a joint account at the time this was going on and she was taking money out for “expenses” and using that to pay for the scripts. 

Apparently she was providing he majority to friends who roped her into writing for them. She was taking a fair amount herself. No wonder her friends were all super nice to me (I thought it was coz I was a nice guy)

Not my finest hour. 

I’ll answer any questions you guys may have. 

TL/DR Girlfriend/fiancée (who has BPD & Bipolar) at time stole my prescription pad wrote herself & her friends benzos and opioids (plus shit that really shouldn’t be seen outside a hospital setting) got caught out and put me in a very precarious position which I managed to wiggle out of (thank Christ). I still married her tho. 2 kids and 15 years later, hasn’t been a repeat. ",1537437929.0

I was parked on red smoking in my car. Although ive smoked in the same spot hundreds of times, its a low key spot in a nice suburb, everyone minds their business.

Im watching netflix on my phone while I smoke and I look up to my left to see a cop on a motorcycle. Fuck. I was caught red handed as fuck so there was nothing i could do. He tells me to roll down my window. He gives me this look like are you serious man? 

I ask him to please show me mercy. He was like are you joking? He asks for my ID. I say please I dont want my life to be ruined over me being an idiot.

He goes youre ruining your own life. He asks who i live with. I say my mother. He asks about my dad. I say hes been out of the picture for a long time and that its just me and my mother and ive taken care if her for a long time.

He tells me to call her on the phone and put it on speaker. He takes my phone and walks away and tells her whats going on. I cant hear what he saying. He tells her hes just going to give me a ticket for parking on red. I guess he decided to actually show me mercy. He hangs up and takes a picture of my tar and the straw and clips i was using to smoke it, all of which he had me place on the roof of my car.

He gives me a little mini lecture and asks if i have any questions. I say no and thank him and tell him to go ahead and write the ticket and ill be on my way. He hands me back my license and tells me to drive off and let the wind take care of my shit. In other words, he didnt give me a ticket and told me to drive off with my drugs still on the roof of my car. The street i turned on is a busy one so anything that would fall of would be run over.

I drive off, turn onto the first street and check to see if my stuff is on my car. My clips and straw were still there but my gram of tar was gone. I grab my stuff and pocket it. It had about a .25 still on it. I call my mom and tell her everything is ok and that im coming home. Not before i call my hook and get another gram. I thought of going back and searching for my lost gram but figured i wouldnt press my luck. All in all it cost me a $70 gram of heroin and infinite shame. 

Ive been trying to quit and this is the straw that broke the camels back, so it was for the best. Fuck everything and everyone. Fuck heroin, it doesnt even get me high anymore. 

As far as my mother.. she had suspicions that ive been doing drugs. I told her that this was a good thing because it gave me the jolt i needed without fucking up my life. Now she can even help me detox too instead of my trying to hide a fucking detox from her.

I have no regrets. Ive learned a lot from this journey but the journey must come to an end for it to have meaning. ""There comes a time when you have to turn your back on that nonsense and just say no.""

I had no connects left though so to Craigslist I went. After a few conversations I found a guy in my area and went through the usual process proving your not LE. In that process we noticed many mutual friends on social media. After we met up everything was chill and we realized we went to middle school together like 8—10 years ago. 


    But to the compassionate part, usually around here dealers like that won’t sell anything less than 40 but I’ve been trying to stay as sober as possible so I don’t spiral back into addiction faster than necessary. But he was willing to sell me a dub. After that we started talking about life and just everything and I thanked him for being one of the few to sell small sacks and how that helped me not fuck up my life as much with this stuff. 


         So after hearing my whole story, he right away just says,” we all people out here sometime people forget that, and I know sometimes people just new help from others sometimes” and proceeds to say that if you’re trying to quit than dubs aren’t the way to go. So he says he would sell me 15s to 10s to 5s to even 2 sacks if I really want to taper down and quit or just want a little to get high without having to get a whole half gram to use up and fall completely back into full addiction


       I don’t know I just got some great vibes from basically a stranger that they truly wanted to just do whatever would be best and make me happiest regardless of the money involved. It’s such a rare occurrence for me to feel like the dealer actually wants what’s best for his customer and reminds me theres good in the world even in its darkest corners.

And she was the plug's girl.

Fuckkk man. I had the plug's sexy plump little ass, mini italian looking face, beautiful little belly... In my room. Off limits. Even she knew it.





While she timidly walked inside smiling with wild difficult to contain excitement and the sweet feel of freedom from his bondage.





But even me.... on heroin, and having one small tool of protection, I still *thought* I was top dog and could handle anything that came my way and I was always so obsessed every time I saw her.... But then..

I noticed her piercing gaze that would dissect my innermost vibes with the first question I ever asked her the first time we were alone together in that room, five minutes walking from where the team of Florida narcotics force had found the 10 oz of raw dope.








Nikki said ""You know, you're eventually gonna probably get shot over this.""


I smiled, paused. Our eyes burning to know how this vibe between us could even possibly have ignited so fast.

""You're right, can I just see how you'd fit me?"" I replied. I laid down and motioned for her to come be the little spoon. 

""What!!?? You're fucking crazy!!"" She said fighting back every desire. Every lustful wish.

Every fear.

Every wall.








And she jumped into that bed with me and fit so perfect against me I got hard instantly and she spun around for eyes to meet.

""How the fuck is this happening?""

I was thinking the same thing. About her eyes. Instantly she knew I had always wanted her truly. Instantly we were in love regardless of whether or not we wanted to be. She just knew my most innermost vibes.

She knew right there she would be doing nothing but trying to fucking repopulate the Earth with me by breaking several ""records"" if you guys (and girls) know what I mean. 

And now I got all these hoes man.



And I don't want any of them. I want my bear cub back. ""Come come"" she'd say in the sweetest doped out little baby voice to me. ""I saw how you looked at the store clerk."" She was possessive of me. But i loved it. She loved me. And i loved her.


So. 


Fucking.


Much.

OK friends, now that that is out of the way.. let me get right to the point-  with opiates and the lifestyle in general, many people lose touch, either IRL or in our little(?) reddit community.    If you have anyone on your mind [from around here] that you haven't seen in a while, you should comment their username and if you know the whereabouts of any user posted..you should reply and update us.

Definitely don't want to hear about anyone's personal business or any gossip or speculation.., so keep that in mind.  I also hope you understand that this idea is coming from a place of concern.  there are some amazing souls around here.

I'll kick this off by naming two but I have to do it in the comments in order for a page.     Good luck, be kind to each other, and stay safe.

And I compare the cognitive effect, that it does this, to MDMA (not in a rolling way but the emotionally openness). For example I took it earlier today (20mg IR) and I’m feeling pretty depressed, back in bed listening to music I haven’t touched in weeks, with the ability to cry (something I absolutely can’t do sober anymore since the age 12-13, until I learn that sober skill again).

It always gives me this calm headspace yet focused but it’s almost sedating almost always for me. I tried abusing it once (taking 20mg tablets throughout the night with a buddy 1-2 at a time ever hour, not a smoker but I sure smoked over 15+ cigs that night) and I felt absolutely guilty and disgusting (even though I just talked small talk all night) as the “binge” ended 2pm and I was up for almost 2 days, first day didn’t abuse, couldn’t sleep and the second day without sleep I decided to wanna feel what everyone loved about it. Not even at the 160mg range mark after all that night..

Anyways, yeah it’s making me feel depressed, mentally focused slightly but sedated in a weird way hard to describe.. other times I’ve gotten productive, hungry.

But the main point is I noticed, depending on *my* mood, Adderall amplifies how I feel inside in a sense.
Doesn’t feel no where near MDMA except for this openness trait on my mood. 

Adderall for me isn’t like Opiates where when your up, down, left, right, crazy, it always put me in a normal, on the happy side of my headspace, but I was still emotionally rational and functional.

I want to know if anyone else has this similar effect? Somewhat at least?",1537407754.0

I NEED to have a few more bottles to come off properly and not seek street drugs. I don’t abuse opioids I have chronic pain. Should I say that?

I am a little worried about a locum GP (any brother Brits on here will know what I mean!) who prescribed me 7.5mg zopiclone to help ease some crippling insomnia. S/he didn't radiate confidence and I've had a serious incident with a clueless GP last year - the GP doubled my azathioprine dose for five days to help with an Crohn's mini-flare. Turns out it was a severely toxic dose and was the final bullet that killed my thyroid. Hence why I'd feel much better with some amateur-experts opinions!

I'm on 10mg Subutex a day and currently no other narcotics or first generation sedative anti-histamines. Long story short I was on a cocktail of codeine, long release dihydrocodeine, cyclizine (a great booster, but legitimately the only anti-emetic that worked to stop 15-20 vomiting sessions a day) and liquid morphine to deal with several bad bowel blockages that led to two major resections in 7 months.

I was told as long as I took only one 7.5mg a night for a couple of days there should be no problem with the buprenorphine combo due to it's ceiling for respiratory depression, and that I'm already above it.

Anyone with personal experience, or with a well rounded knowledge agree with that? Bloody comes to something when the users are better placed than a doctor!

Just out of interest (and my addictive personality needing to know!) would codeine/zopiclone cause problems due to the lack of respiratory ceiling?

9h1fv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9h1fv2/i_think_im_done/,34,https://redd.it/9h1fv2,iwanttomakesense,I think I'm done,"I've been on oxycodone and morphine for almost two years now. I have a connective tissue disorder and the only way that I can describe it is that I just hurt all the time. On a good day it feels like I had my ass kicked two days ago. On a bad day it feels like there's acid in my shoulder blades or hot needles in my back. Sometimes I get headaches that last for days where I lose most of my vision and puke uncontrollably. It drove me crazy. I lost my wife, my job, my kids. I tried to kill myself several times.

Then after years of negative experiences with health care specialists, I finally found a doctor that listened to me. We tried a few different drugs before settling on oxycodone. Then we added morphine on top. For the most part the meds helped with the baseline pain, we never could get the headaches under control though and they got progressively worse, especially this summer. I lost my job again. Got a new, better paying one right after and couldn't make it through the first night shift as my back was spasming and had to leave the shop several times to throw up. Lost that one too. Almost immediately.

I had also been seeing a doctor at a pain clinic who would give me nerve block injections sometimes up to fifty injections all along my back, neck, head and face. They don't help, they just make me uncomfortably numb for a few hours at most until my symptoms return but I do it anyways because it looks better on paper that as someone taking opioids, I am also seeking other avenues of treatment.

He recently left and I was switched to a new doctor who on our third visit suggested we 'give effexor a try and see how that works out' and told me I was a drug seeker when I informed him that no, I had been on effexor when I was younger for depression and I did not want to go back to that for a multitude of reasons. He told me that I was a drug seeker and typed a lot of what I imagine were some pretty negative things to my primary physician through the medical portal that they use to communicate with each other. I tried not to think about it and sat there as he silently injected me with local anesthetic after his sanctimonious diatribe.

When I went to refill my script, I didn't realize it at the time but my prescription had been cut in half without any warning from my doctor. I didn't notice because the script had been written for a month this time - I normally have to request a refill every two weeks so the amount was still technically the same as always in terms of both amount and cost. The pharmacist, who has always  treated me like a junkie from the moment I filled my first script, didn't even bother to mention the change. Had I have to thought to read the label I would have seen the ""DOSE REDUCED"" but such is life.

My head had been pretty brutal for most of August and the first part of September so naturally I ran out earlier than expected... Even earlier than usual. When I finally did look at the bottle to double check when my next refill was due, I noticed the dose had been changed. After the interaction with the 'pain specialist' I can only assume that this was meant to be a taper off. My doctor has never expressed any desire to lower my dose in the past and the fact that she did it without explaining why does not look good at all.

The last week has been hell to say the least  and I still have to wait two more to find out what the hell is going on but the situation looks pretty grim. My symptoms are back in full force most days and the withdrawals on top of that just about killed me and tbh I genuinely wanted to die. But now I'm feeling better in a really, really fucking wierd way.

I recently started therapy, which the old me would have never done but I genuinely wanted to work on my mental health even before I knew I was likely losing my meds. Withdrawing during the first session was probably one of the worst experiences of my life. At the same time though, it was an amazingly gratifying situation. The WD's had made me so vulnerable that I was unable to keep my normal facade up and I actually just talked. And kept talking. I'm not proud to say but I had to hold back tears for alot of it. It was the perfect storm, I was like a therapists wet dream. For the first time in my life I was actively addressing the problems in my life instead of desperately trying to avoid them.

While the WD's are gone for the most part. I don't think the cravings will ever really go away but I hope eventually they'll start to subside. I've been using the short amount of  time that I've been 'clean' and in therapy to think about the road ahead, and I have two options at this point. One being heroin, as pills are hard to come by in my neck of the woods and the small amount that I had access to for times like these are no longer available. And two, accept my fate and try to be as positive as I can about it. Deal with the pain and do my best to be happy and show those that are important to me how much I care about them instead of never texting or calling anybody back, never leaving the house except for work/ visits my kids, or nodding myself to sleep every fucking night because I can't handle the physical or mental pain that never ever seems to go away. And the fucked up thing is, I think I'm gonna go with option two.

Being without oxy has taken away my ability to shut off my brain when the demons want to hang out and I've had to face them head on. No more numbing myself because I miss my wife or kids. You miss them? Find a way to get them back, you fuck. No more passing out on the floor because I hate what my disorder has turned me into. You're in pain? Find a less physical job, dumbass. Stop hurting yourself for money, there are other options. No more getting fucked up because mom didn't love me growing up and won't talk to me as an adult. I just gotta deal with it. 

I'm still scared as shit about the headaches that I get because they seem to strike randomly and can last anywhere from an evening to a fortnight but you can't win em all, I guess. Then again they are a beast that even oxy couldn't tame so it's something I'm just gonna have to learn to live with.

I didn't really talk to any of you but I followed some of your stories pretty closely to the point that I felt like I knew you. I related to alot of the chaos in a lot of your lives. And I just want to say that I love you guys. Especially Metro so if you guys could do me a solid maybe stop downvoting his fucking wowzies?

Chasingd0pamine gets an honourable mention and of course Tracey. Tracey, you're doing the Lord's work.

Thanks to the people that answered my dumb questions when I was confused about things like cold water extraction, and thanks to the people that answered the even dumber questions that I would ask on my burner accounts. My personal favourites were the ones where I thought I was dying because of certain drug cocktails that should never be taken but are also just too much fucking fun not to.

Everybody be safe out there, from my brothers and sisters on the needle to those of us who loved our pills just a little too much and everybody in between. Nod for me guys because I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to for a long, long time. If I ever do again.

Just earlier today I was totally DESPAIRING. A good shot of crack and heroin loaded up, I was sick as fuck, and could not find a vein anywhere. I've used up all my good sites - crook, arms, hand, wrists, feet, even my shoulders and around my biceps. For the last few weeks I've been thinking that I'm going to have to go neck or groin since it was getting SO difficult to hit a vein, and often when I did hit a vein trying to inject would cause searing pain and a weird red mark. Not a miss, but apparently the veins are obstructed, so even if I hit some blood and dont move the needle a millimeter it will still not be a hit. In desperation today, I tried somewhere new.

This may be common knowledge to you, but I decided to try the back side of my arm, the spot thats usually really awkward and difficult to hit because of the angle. That is until today when I realised that I could turn the needle so that I was injecting against the flow of blood - *away* from the heart - and still hit the vein perfectly fine! 

This has opened up a whole new area for me of really good veins that are giving that big purple gush of blood and its fucking awesome! I know they won't last forever, but I'm rotating my sites since for the first time since I started using this has opened up a whole new bunch of great veins at once, and I'm going to try and make them last. I didn't ever hit them before because if you try to put the needle in the right position i.e. with the flow of blood, they become unhittable as they are at a weird angle, but I have had three shots today and put the needle in the ""wrong"" way and have had zero problems. I know it's probably not ideal to go against the flow but it sure beats starting to use my groin or missing. 

Thought I'd post this in case there were any fellow junkies out there like me who didn't realise these veins could be hit by going against the flow. There is nothing worse than being sick and having the cure in your hand and not being able to get it into your body, so if this helps one fellow junkie then I be pleased.

Hope Junkie Jesus smiles on you all as he has guided my needle today! :) ",1537313100.0

It’s hard to fathom that he thought he’d become a heroin addiction (IV). I’m 99% sure he doesn’t bother to carry Narcan.,"Is there any possibility that my brother is happy?  I move him so much. We used to be so close. Or perhaps as close as he COULD be to a human?

I meant to say it’s hard to fathom that he would develop a severe heroin addiction. It happens so ok. But he put no attempts to slow the progression down, at all. He was able to do that with drinking and he’s a severe alcoholic. 

He heavily abused drugs and alcohol since he was a teen, heavily. A lot of it stems from a severe, unloving upbringing.  I was no angel, but he is the most reckless person I know.   I’m not judging ....just the way he was (is)?

He also betrays everyone, including me, but I’m not really mad. I know it’s up to him to choose kicking H - I don’t see it happening. I wish my intuition was wrong.  He lies so much. Even senseless lies. 

He changed and is it a personality change from withdrawal or long term drug and alcohol use?  I’m a recovered alcoholic and I’m lucky my liver is OK. 

He had a lot of aspirations—-he never cared for work but his college degree was so important to him. He dropped out senior year.  

His favorite author was at a local store today - signing books. It was a surprise!  It wasn’t Stephen King...but that popular. He would have been excited and I would have bought us both books to sign. Now, I bet he wouldn’t care.  

He’s handsome. Or was. His looks are GONE. He was a good dresser, too. A bit of vanity but he carried himself well. He looks like he was thrown in a ditch, face first.

I have a couple of other questions - but is he maybe satisfied with his life?  I want happiness for him. Saw him a few years ago, he’d OD’d and aspirated and I legally make medical decisions if he can’t consent. So much pain. 

I’m scared of him now. Especially “friends.”  Lots of B &amp;amp; E, including family. But true B&amp;amp; E plus knicking stuff to pawn during the day. 

He screws over everyone. Everyone. He got in the scene as an enforcer and I heard he’s been greenlit. He stole a bunch if opiates from the main dealer.  

Oh. He doesn’t work a regular job. So he’s scraping together money daily by whatever means. 

I need to quit worrying.  I can’t let go. Yet maybe it was all a lie. I freely gave him money thinking he was clean.  

He gave me company and safety when I left my marriage. I knew I’d given him 60k over a year and just as a gift....but I didn’t say steal. Just ask. 

He was homeless, too, so he needed a place to stay for free. I bet he is homeless a lot yet I cannot imagine. 

But what if he died?  Will he die happy?  I miss that f@cker but I do NOT trust him. ",1537311498.0

Last year I managed to drag myself into treatment for 30 days after getting hooked on opiates for 3 nasty years. I started in college just like anyone else, oxys and whatnot. After a few years of barely scraping by I was about to fail out of school and was very reliant on heroin to get through my days. I couldnt take it anymore and my family couldnt either. I went to treatment last January. It was awesome actually I learned a lot and reopened my eyes to life. However, I didn't take anyones advice and stuck with suboxone. After treatment I managed to get a job I love working outside at a Garden Center. Right before the fall I was accepted by financial aid to finish my last semester at college and get my degree. Everything in me wanted to get off the suboxone before I started school. I was on 16mg a day so I started halfway through the summer. I got myself down to 1mg a day of suboxone. With a month before school, it hit me. I got high again. It's like I was living in a different reality because of the suboxone. Off and on, I've gotten right back to where I was. Instead of getting help or detoxing before school, I manned up and said I got this. Well it's a few weeks into the semester and I definitely don't got this. In fact I had to move home again, and my life has really affected my folks. My mom can't handle it anymore. She ended up figuring a lot out that I would never have included her in on (for the sake of her sanity), but she figured it out. At this point I just can't believe I got back to this point. I can't focus. I can't retain information. I'm usually a smart guy, but I've been reduced down to a t.v. watching dumbass who manages to go to work for 16 hours a week. I'm sad guys. I'm calling the treatment place I went to last year and I'm going tomorrow. The hardest part for me right now is how I'm going to get the University to understand I've fucked up once again, and how I'm going to tell my job that I'm going to be gone. The job is lowpaying and just some job, but I love the people like family. Guess I just needed to get this all out there since I havent been able to talk about it much.  
Thanks for reading guys wish me luck

The point of maintenance therapy should be offering you a safe alternative to street drugs and the hustle and crime, period. Adding tons of catches and strings and red tape only drives people back to the street and now their tolerance is lower and DEAD! Bravo medical pros!  The only real reason to kick someone off is if they are not taking their meds and obvious financially diverting them, period. No one should be kicked off for pee tests coming back for other drugs, what the hell kind of sense does that make? Well we see here you are struggling, so get the fuck out and go back to your street H! What is this a jealous GF? You'd think a med pro would say hey it seems you are struggling, does your dose need increasing?

It seems like sometimes the rationale for the strict rules and zero tolerance is to get only those who are committed to quitting and are willing to show effort but I feel this is wrong. If it was seen more as government competing against the illicit market for those dependent, think of how much market share they could take away and lives back on track or even saved.

Surprisingly Canada and Britain and Australia and a lot of Europe is surprisingly backwards, even for subs they make you dose essentially like methadone. Have to come in every day to a pharmacy, dose in front of the disgusted pharmacist who hates dealing with this crap daily wasting his time. Sometimes at a special addicts counter or area, yea sounds great!

It turns out when you load up on a big supply of opiates without having ANY tolerance, it's pretty easy to just nod the FUCK out.

Oh well. Supply wise I've just been chilling on a massive supply of weed, usually with a bit of opium sprinkled into the joints, some dihydrocodeine and alazopram (courtesy of the pharmacy, no less!), as well as some nice strong heroin (just sniffing, no needles; no need)

It was a pretty weird feeling to walk into the pharmacy and ask for these super tightly controlled drugs and have the actual pharmacists just be like ""yeah, got you bro""

I could use some of your advice on what constitute great recreational pharmaceuticals, specifically opiates.
When I went yesterday, I just wrote down on a list- ""Vicoden, Alazopram, Codeine, Dilaudid, Fentynol"" and asked the pharmacists if they had any of those. They seemed to recognize the Fend and Vicoden but didn't have any in stock. I only checked two pharmacies because I have a serious lack of knowledge about prescriptions. I'm definitely gonna hit the pharmacies again and get more/better goodies.

The way the restaurants advertise and cook with weed here is fucking dope. The first day I got an extra extra strength ""happy pizza"" which knocked me on my fucking ass, and then yesterday I got the strongest possible ""happy milkshake"". Dude, it's like a big ole delicious milkshake that would be super delicious without any drugs (which you can't even taste) and it's only a couple bucks.

Two big upcoming missions: tomorrow I'm going to relocate from a hotel to an Airbnb. That's gonna mean I'll have a whole goddamn apartment to myself, full kitchen, living room, etc... AND this place has a motherfucking outdoor jacuzzi on a balcony with a direct view of the river! I'm gonna spend so much time chillin on that balcony getting fucked up, what a dream vacation.

The second big mission is renting a motorbike, 125 cc is all a man needs - and it's less than 5 dollars a day I believe. Total freedom: might actually end up taking a roadtrip to some other nearby countries, but who knows; everything is so chill here that it's pretty hard to leave!

So, I got to thinking about something I could do to eliminate the foamy bubbly bullshit.  I remembered my high-school days of funneling beers, and using my finger to rub the side of my nose and putting the finger with the nose grease on it into the beer foam, in the funnel.  This dissolved the foam, so to speak.  Then I had an idea! 

So, I put 1 drop of cooking oil (any type will work) into my OP+coke solution, screwed the lid onto my Magic Bullet (the food processor not the sex toy) cup and began microwaving it.  Yes!  The bubbles only went halfway up the cup and stayed there, and I was able to just let it cook!  Within 4 min my OP pieces were clear and no foamy bubbles leaked out of the lid! :)",1537247587.0

We (an Australian state) recently hosted the DEFQON 1 music festival. I’m not familiar with the specific sub culture, who attends etc, however there were apparently a rash of drug overdoses and the place was awash with drugs (keeping the cops very busy). 

Dozens of people in hospital. Two young people tragically passed away. 

The Premier (elected head of government in the state & member of parliament) is talking about cancelling the festival, disallowing similar events & is convening an “expert panel” to report on what can be done. 

The irony here is that we literally have government run HEROIN INJECTING ROOMS that supply free injecting supplies and medical staff on site with free Naloxone, alcohol swabs, syringes et al for all! 

Pill testing is being advocated by the vast majority of the community in an effort to facilitate harm minimisation. Yet with their monolithic and blimp mentality, the government is simply saying “don’t do drugs. 

They’re illegal and you don’t know what’s in them”. NO SHIT that’s why we need pill testing so our kids don’t fucking die! 

Still promoting abstinence. Still talking about the tragedy of losing young lives, yet they won’t permit simple measures that can help save those young lives that they’re allegedly so concerned about. 

You can literally cross a border here and the next state over actually provides government funded pill testing. No drug overdoses there! 

The press gallery are thankfully excoriating the government in a live press conference, but I just wanted a rant about how fucked up drug prohibition and policy is. 

A member of the fourth estate, asked a particularly incisive question:

 “if people are overdosing on drugs, because they are illegal and thus made in suboptimal conditions, by criminals, with unknown and dangerous chemicals, and it’s those chemicals that are causing the deaths of our young people, why would you be opposed to testing that could inform their choice of whether to take it or not?” (paraphrasing).

Premier stammering and going red in the face “drugs are illegal so don’t take them”. 

Great job Gladys (yes our premiers name is Gladys).

Fuck me I hate politicians. They’re as thick as two short planks. They purport to represent the people, yet when the people say “we want decriminalised drugs and pill testing” they’d rather young people die. 

It’s frankly disgusting. 

Sorry for the rant, guys.

What do you guys think, if someone (yes, me actually) uses opiates for a year, first like, once a month or so, and then for the next 8 months, at least every week or two weeks, that eventually, they'll be in physical withdrawal? I do know I'm deep in the psychological addiction, which is why when I use it's generally 2-3 day binges, but yeah, last time I did that, which was 4 days ago, seems to have taken some interesting toll on me. And by interesting, I mean fucking horrific.

I mean, I'm probably not gonna list all the symptoms cause I don't wanna be that guy who writes paragraphs about every little thing they feel, but like, I couldn't sleep for shit yesterday because I felt fucking horrible, not too much in specific except breathlessness for no reason, I just felt shitty. And then today I was havin a fun little walk on my way to cop some shit (unfortunately, my dealer flaked), when out of now where I had to shit like mad and yeah, now I'm nauseous as fuck and I couldn't even finish a bloody MUFFIN. And then I was convinced I'm dying because that's literally what everything in my body was telling me. It's not that bad now but yeah, again, skin on fucking fire.

S5E9/10.,"**EDIT: SPOILERS AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN THIS FAR IN THE SERIES. FORGOT TO TAG THE TITLE THAT'S MY BAD. REPEAT, SPOILERS FOR THE NETFLIX ORIGINAL SHOW BOJACK HORSEMAN ARE IN THIS POST. IF YOU ARE NOT CAUGHT UP TO S5E10, TURN BACK NOW. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.**

First of all, this show is great. If you haven't seen it, check it out. It's on Netflix. It's basically about this Horse who was an actor in a famous 90's TV show called Horsin' Around. And now he's in his 50's and dealing with long-term depression. 

Well season 5 just came out yesterday and I'm loving it so far. It's gone in an even darker direction than the rest of the show. 

Well in this particular episode of season 5, he's taking opiate pills for his herniated disk that he got from messing up a stunt for his new show. And his sister flushes them down his sink because she thought he was trying to drug her. So they go on a search for more pills because he's ""in pain"". Later in this chase, they're being chased by the police, and he lifts his sister and himself over a fence in order to get away. Well once they get away, his sister points out that his back shouldn't be in pain if he was able to do that. He denies up and down that he's using them recreationally, and takes her to the airport so she can go back home. 

On the drive home, he stops at a red light, and picks up the empty pill bottle. He holds in up and looks inside, desperately hoping somehow there'll be another pill inside, then licks his finger and swirls it around the inside of the bottle. He starts jittering and sweating and looking around frantically, then speeds through the red light and gets into a massive car crash. The next episode starts off with him having several broken bones, and taking more pills. 

This is probably the realest, most accurate portrayal of addiction. I know people, personally, who have done something like that; hurting themselves to get painkillers. I, myself, have frantically and obsessively shaken my bottles upside down, hoping some nonexistent pill would fall out, licked my finger to try and get pill dust. I've been clean for 9 months, and this episode was very triggering for me. 

Anyway just thought I'd share. Check out Bojack Horseman on Netflix if you're interested. ",1537225654.0

I no longer make a living valet parking cars at the hotel downtown.

Not that I ever made much of a living there, at least not the way people who own houses and cars make livings, but you get what I mean. Maybe the better way to say it is that I no longer eek out enough money to pay rent at Dale’s place and manage to save a few dollars by surviving on a diet of Spam and diet coke with the money I make as a hotel valet. No more. It’s over. The train ride home tonight is the last time I’ll be coming home from work or wearing the uniform, and as unhappy as I was working there, as boring as it was, I’m sadder and emptier about losing the job than I would have ever imagined. It hurts.

I’m missing my regular A.A. meeting, too. Usually, I’m sitting in the church basement right now, listening to some old timer rattle on about how a person will stay sober all day if they don’t take the first drink or some newcomer talk about how he thinks he can smoke weed and still be sober. It’s always interesting to see the reactions it gets. Sometimes, I laugh at the way it all goes down. Sometimes, I cringe.

I’m not there for that tonight, though. No laughter. No cringe. No awkward exchanges at the meeting. No serenity prayer or seventh tradition. My whole life is off course. I’ve derailed it. There was an obvious break in the track ahead, but I just went on at full steam, anyway. Didn’t do the things they say to do in N.A. and A.A. Never called my sponsor. Now, the first impacts are being felt, and soon my life will be a smoldering heap of twisted metal. I will lie. I will steal. I will use whoever I have to use to get my drugs. My days will dissipate like smoke. My bones will burn like embers in a fire. From the wreckage I will emerge as the monster that I am, the monster I have to be to feed my addiction.

Sounds melodramatic. I know. I’m just not sure how else to say it. What’s stranger about all of it is that even as I become as ruthless and ridiculous as I can become, even as I hurt people, I will long for love and approval and friendship. It’s hard to explain. It’s not rational, but neither is drug addiction. For now, though, the changes are subtler. Less severe in every way. For now, I’ve only relapsed and lost my job. For now, I’ve only missed my home meeting and failed to call Jerry like he asked. For now, I just have to get to my room without talking to Dale, if I can avoid it.

I do. The shower’s running when I get home, and the light in the bathroom is on. The door is shut. He is blowing his nose and hawking loogies in the shower. Dale is singing some old gospel hymn. My room is black and chilly when I get into it. I close the door and collapse onto my bed, pulling my shoes and socks off with my feet and letting them fall onto the floor in the dark. The heroin is wearing off, but residuals sit in my throat like an egg and in my stomach like a warm molten metal. My mind wanders. Life is a practical joke. I think to myself. One I don’t get. I remember the first time I realized that life seemed to be an inherently miserable and melancholy affair but was also somehow comical in its irony, even if it has never made me laugh.

In my earliest memories my mother has no face. Seriously. I know that’s weird, but that’s how it is when I think of what she was like during my childhood. The way I remember her renders the woman who gave birth to me as nothing more than her body from the neck down, whatever clothes she was wearing and accessories she carried or the way she smelled at any given moment, like at night when my dad used to read in his armchair under the lamp and she smoked cigarettes on the phone and laughed with ice cubes clanking in a glass of liquor. Those nights she is a lit cigarette and the sweet smell of mixed drink to me. But on this night, the one where I am bawling in my bed because everyone I know in the entire world is going to die, she wears a thin cotton gown. Sun spots on her chest and moles on her soft white arms. I can smell lavender and cold cream glycerin. There is a pink handled comb in her lap. She strokes my hair. To me, my mother speaks with the voice of God, but it is feminine and worn and glowing radiant light from behind the clouds hiding her face, the clouds my memory puts there for some reason. She whispers that I’m an ugly crier. She says my face is covered in red splotches and gets up to turn the lights off and leaves me in the dark.

The memory doesn’t end there. My father comes in an hour or so after her. He must hear me crying on the way to his bed, separate from my mother’s bed. So, he turns in at my room at the top of the stairs but leaves the lights off. The lamp in the hallway backlights his wild hair. His silhouette is identical to Albert Einstein’s. That is what I’m thinking even though I’m still crying, and he asks what’s wrong, and I tell him, and he throws his head back and laughs like it’s all some sick joke he’s in on and been waiting to see play out. He speaks again. The gleaming white calcium of his teeth makes me realize that under his skin and hair and fat and without all the soft tissue and blood, my own father is just a skull and skeleton talking to me. I distinctly remember thinking that, even as I am having this breakdown at five years old. The thought scares me. All he has to say about everyone dying, though, is that I’m going to die, too, but that only makes me bawl harder. He matches my crying with even louder laughter, sitting on my bed and his hand on my chest.

As sleep takes over in my room at Dale’s, the memory of my father changes into some strange mixture of Albert Einstein and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr and himself. Three in one. The images of that night at five years old melt into incoherent dreamworld silliness and visitations from nightmare beings who whisper. I have visions of evil in the dark, and everything is on fire. I’m a melodramatic person. What can I say? And if I am, it only makes sense that my sleep process is, too. Then, it is the black void of slumber for the rest of the night.

The front door bangs shut and sends a rattle through my bedroom windows.

Blinds are drawn. Grey morning light pushes through them. Dale’s Ford Explorer starts outside and drives off. I’ve slept later than I have on a weekday since I’ve lived here, and it gives me terrible anxiety. There’s also something about brain chemistry when you sedate it with something like heroin and remove the sedative, even just once. The brain’s natural energy and thought life feels unnatural and over stimulated. There’s a bit of crust in my eye like a giant bacon bit with sharp corners. Drool on my face is slimy and stinks. Splotches of white decorate my pillow case. My neck and shoulders ache.

Dale knows I’m not at work. That’s not good. It will require an explanation soon enough. Probably, anyway. It’s possible that it won’t, but if I do ever have to give him one, I’m going to lie. That’s just where it’s at now, and I don’t care. Calling Beth is the next item on the list of things to do.

My brain is on autopilot, like it has relegated all decisions to the parts of my brain inherited from our reptilian ancestors. Those parts are baser and more primitive and able to pick through the subconscious to determine what course of action is most profitable to feed itself. It makes decisions based on realizations I don’t even know that I have had. Beth hasn’t been to a meeting in a month. We’ve only talked a few times over the last two. She’s relapsed.

The phone rings through to her voicemail. I call back. She answers and says that she’d come get me, but the baby is sleeping and can’t be woken up. I’ll have to take the bus to see her.

10

I smoke Winston cigarettes.

They remind me of Ghostbuster’s, and that's why I like them. Now, Beth is sitting on the floor asking me for one. I pull it of my soft pack. I also like soft packs. They’re retro, kind of, at least to me, and she reaches up. Beth grabs the lighter on the scratched coffee table. It’s the one I helped her pull out of a dumpster last winter. There’s a Where’s Waldo book, a few rolling papers and a small pile of weed. She turns her head to light the cigarette, so she doesn’t set her hair on fire and asks me,

“What’s up?”

“You know. Same old. Same old.” I laugh.

“Nah. This is not the same old, same old, Randy.” The banter of some old macho cowboy blares in black and white out of the TV on the wall.

“Are you sure? Seems like it to me.”

“Yeah. I’m sure. What’s going on? I’m not tripping on you or nothing. You just don’t ever come over here on a Thursday morning. You have a job, remember? Or am I wrong about that?”

I don’t say anything. Just smile.

“Got fired?” She speaks sweetly. Her words are full of a certain sadness.

“No. Not exactly. I wouldn’t say that.”

“What would you say?” She laughs a little.

“It was time to retire from my career as a valet. What? Don’t you think there’s a time to move on from something?”

“Yeah. But, usually, when someone moves on from something, they have something to move onto. Ya know?”

“Exactly! What do you think I’m here for?”

“Oh. So. You moved onto me, have you?”

“Yeah. I don’t see why not, baby.” I smile big. Our relationship has never been like that.

“Baby? I’m not your baby. Besides. Gunter wouldn’t have it.” Gunter is her sugar daddy. He’s an old miser who immigrated over here as a kid but now pays her rent and bills in exchange for whenever he wants her companionship. It’s hard to think that they have sex, but I don’t know. Either way, he’s not possessive of her. A true sugar daddy.

“What’s he gotta know about it?” I look up at one of her baby doll heads. Beth has a thing about decapitating baby dolls and painting them. It’s her artistic expression. At least, that’s what she says.

“Um. This is his place. He’s gonna know if you live here. He comes by with groceries twice a week and has right to come in whenever he wants.”

It’s true. I can’t stay with her, and I know it. Her baby cries from the back room, and Beth runs to go get her. I haven’t seen the baby since Beth first had her and brought her to all the meetings for everyone to meet, like a piece of pink and grey ball of mashed up hamburger meat in a napkin that we all passed around. I always have a hard time knowing if I’m acting right in those situations.

Am I making the appropriate goo goo gaga sounds? Am I supposed to talk to it with words? Why would I? They are usually sleeping. Babies don’t understand anyway, but I’m always afraid of seeming inhuman. So, she comes back in with her daughter who has turned into an extremely selfish and irrationally angry monkey over the last ten months. The child pulls Beth’s hair and screams. She knocks things over and laughs. It seems like children always want to do the worst possible thing they can, like play with the chemicals under the sink or stick something in an electrical outlet or crush themselves by climbing on cabinets and pulling them down, but I’m not much different. I like poison and doing things that will probably get me killed too. For some of us, nothing ever changes.

I ask Beth if I can use her Facebook messenger to message someone. She hands her phone over. Sal is as easy to find as he said he would be. He comes right up and even responds to my text immediately. I text my number and wait on the couch for the call. There are six 20-dollar bills in my wallet. Sal’s got the fire.",1537219456.0

(And a long ass story from me),"Has anyone hid their use from their girlfriend/boyfriend? What problems did it cause? Did you end up telling them eventually? Has anyone kept using and never told them at all and had them never find out?

I apologize, but as always from your good friend Angry Chair, this post is probably gonna be longer than it needs to be, but I’d like to tell it all to someone and get it off my mind.

 I had a serious and pretty long term (at least for my young age at the time, about 2 years) relationship with a girl but we both had trust issues and many other issues and well, she was crazy. We both were I guess. We got too serious too young. We planned to get back together in the future after some time apart but after a couple days apart she missed me a lot and wanted to get back together really bad, but when I meant in the future I meant maybe a couple months or a year in the future, not a week. 
I moved on faster than I should have and started talking to other girls within a week after breaking up. I guess I was just glad to be free after being young and attached to one girl for so long. I made the mistake of getting serious with another girl in 2 months (big mistake).
Anyways I never used dope when I was with girl A. She was very controlling and would say she would break up with me if I started using hard drugs, and I agree it was very stupid that I stayed in that relationship and obeyed her rules but I guess it was good because my life didn’t spiral out of control until we split apart and I was free. I did coke behind her back sometimes but it was no big deal. 
I can’t remember if I tried dope once or twice while we were still together, but I do know I didn’t get actually into it until after we split. 

So I started talking to Girl B, and around this time I would use dope maybe once every week or so, sometimes a couple days in a row, sometimes going a few weeks without it (basically whenever I could find it I would do it.) I ended up overdosing in front of Girl B the morning after I made her my girlfriend when me, her, my best friend and her best friend (we were trying to get them to hook up) all stayed at my friends house for the night and drank and chilled and what not. I told her I “thought it was coke” and got sold something else, and she found out it was dope but I told her it was an accident and that was the only time I had ever done it. So that scared me away from dope for a couple weeks but needless to say I started doing it again, but still not getting hooked. I would do it whenever I could find it cuz I just felt like I was a better version of myself when I was on it. Well one day came where I used a few more days in a row than I should have and woke up in withdrawal. (Not the first time, but i still wasn’t in an active addiction. I would feel kinda shitty for about 2 days and then be fine, find some dope again a few days to a week later and start it all over) it wasn’t terrible withdrawal but I was anxious, depressed, had the shits like a race horse and couldn’t eat for the life of me. This day just happens to be a day I promised girl B (who I was now dating at the time) that I would go to her nephews birthday party. Great. a kids birthday party while dopesick. I get through that day and throughout the rest of our probably 8 month relationship I get pretty into my dope use (but nowhere near where I am now) and she never finds out. I didn’t have a steady supply, it was basically random when I would be able to get dope so I would always be sick when we would go to parties or events or when she would wanna just hang out. It sucked. 

Few months down the road I realize that Girl B was just some girl I wanted to fuck and I truly belonged with Girl A, but she had found another boyfriend (of whom she is still with) and by this time hated my guts because she thinks I cheated on her when I didn’t. Wtf. (Young relationship drama lol) The tables turned and I started missing her a lot and basically stopped giving a fuck about Girl B but continued to date her for another couple months maybe, just because I was lonely I guess. How sad. Eventually I just break up with her because wtfs the point lol My relationship with girl B was a joke. 

It’s been about a year since me and girl B broke up. I am deeper into my addiction than ever before and I miss Girl A more than ever. I wish I got back together with her when she wanted to. I feel bad for Girl B for hiding my use from her after oding in front of her and staying with her when I knew I was still in love with Girl A, but girl b was honestly kind of a whore and wouldn’t have understood my dope use the way A would have. 

This went from a post about hiding use from your S.O to a novel-long vent about the past 3 years of my life. I apologize for the annoying and whiney bitchey post, but I guess I just needed to get it out. If you read the whole thing I really appreciate it. Anyway feel free to share your experiences with girlfriends (or boyfriends, whatever you’re into) and drug use. Feel free to share anything. Doesn’t matter what. And call me a pussy if you want, I could care less, just wanted to let my thoughts out somewhere as my friends/family would be no use because they wouldn’t understand. Hope everyone’s having a good day so far. Your friend, Angry.",1537208454.0

My wife was away from home over the weekend at her brothers... He had recently had a baby and my wife was there for delivery. 

She flew back in and got off the plane and couldn't even walk straight. My kids noticed it right away and started prodding her about it. I grabbed her arm and told them she was tired and got her to the car. 

When we got home, I took her upstairs and figured she would sleep it off (not the first time she has come home completly wasted, though it is rare), and I went downstairs. I got her bags from the car and put them inside. 

Then I heard the garage open and she went out to the car to ""get her bag"". In more than 10 years she's never gotten her own bag, she's always sent me to go get it. So I got suspicious... And i dumped her bag out. 

I found nicorette (which her mom chews all the time) and some chewing tobacco stuff which her mom also chews... And then I found a pill box of oxy from my uncle who is in the hospital. I called her mom to see if she asked my wife to hold any of her tobacco/gum and she said no. And I knew it wasn't an accident that she had oxy from my uncle. ""Why would I want that? What does it even do?""

After a long fight and argument when she was more coherent I just agreed it must have all been a mistake (I don't but I also don't think arguing will help anything). Her parents are worried now because I told them in an effort for some help on this, but they are the type of people who believe their daughter can do no wrong, so I wound up causing them drama for no reason, especially when they won't help. Question is.. What can I do?

I don't even drink so to me this is very strange to confront, I don't know how to catch her in the act and obviously I have thrown out everything I found. She won't admit she did anything and I kind of figure this was going to happen, because she doesn't want to shame her parents or me.

Yesterday i found a pill crusher and dilaudids in her purse. What do i do? How do I help her? (X-post),"My sister has struggled with pills for the past 5 or so years. It all started when she started hanging out with the wrong crowd, failed out of college, and later got a DUI. 

It's been 2 years since she last relapsed and her DUI. She works as a full time manager at a retail store and went back to school as well. I'm so proud of her and I let her know that. 

She's been acting very strange. She's been extremely jealous, anxious, sad, and needing my full attention constantly. Also she has been spacing out, pupils tiny, and her eyes have been going half shut with very long blinks. My dad is very suspicious but I haven't told him what I found yet. 

I went through her stuff yesterday and I found dilaudid, Xanax, a straw, and a pill crusher. I am so sad she's back on this and all I want her to do is get help and stop. I've been told that she looks up to me and I have the potential to turn this around. I've asked her twice now if she's doing anything and she promised me she hasn't (she lied). 

I'm not sure if I should full on confront her and tell her I found x, y, z, how do I help? Or I just wait and hope she stops on her own. I live 1500 miles away from my family and am unable to be there for her through this. I told my mom already since she lives with her. What do I do? Please help. 

 She's also been hanging around a bad crowd again. The people there do the same thing they did at 20 years old and they are 30 now. My sister needs out but she's an adult and I can't tell her what to do.. she's also been doing cocaine and drinking on everything I've mentioned above. I'm so scared she's going to lose her job and fail out again. 

She's made her friend know that she wants to stop but doesn't know how. She feels empty 24/7 and even worse without the drugs. This all started back again after she got surgery and was prescribed pain killers. She also has a ton of stress but I just don't know what to do. 

UPDATE: I confronted her. I told her how much I love her and I'm her for her. I also said I went through her things and was suspicious and I only did it because I was so concerned. She gave me the pills to throw away but kept two green hulks. She said she took them last night but I know she lied. I let her know I know she's lying and I hope she can make the right decisions. I won't ever see her as a failure because I know how hard this must be for her. I'm hanging out with her all day today and doing what she wants. 

She was also concerned about me telling my mom and said she will tell her when she's ready. I told my mom last night because she needs to know too. My sister lives with my mom and needs her support as well. I just hope I'm doing the right thing at this point ",1537188776.0

I'll let your imagination do the rest.

I always noticed her loyalty to her man. Cartel or not. Biggest kingpin in the area at the time or not. She was a sexy woman. She handled the most hands on of jobs. She ran into just about every guy who would ever want her. I noticed her loyalty. I kept watching. I shut my mouth.

""Do i know you?"" She said to me one day as my middle was inside the opulant five bedroom house she shared with her high ranking, cartel owner. ""No, im C's friend, but i dont think We've met."" Little did I know that within 10 days her big cartel kingpin would be facing 80 years up the road.

Little did she know that under the most dire circumstances, id wish that on *no one.* Little did I know the death threats to follow the next month of my life. She had no clue i lived 5 minutes away walking distance till the day she showed up after the raid.

I could go on about how I ended up falling in love with her to the point of a suicide pact. I could say that she wasnt a nymphomaniac almost to the point of a fault and she couldnt cook better than most five star restaurants. I could say that i had golds in my mouth as a latino and knew how to carry myself before i was with her for 3 years. But what's the use in flaggin u know?

Rest in peace my bear cub. Im more in shock 3 suicide attempts didn't bring us back together. I've had more women and money in the past 3 months than ive had my entire life. Remember when you always said ""if i die, you'll know whether guardian angels exist?"" Well now i know that they do. Just give me one that can buy me happiness.

Often times, doctors are ready to write you a prescription. One of their first choices for pain are opioids. The most common are OxyContin, Vicodin, and Codeine. Many get prescribed these for legitimate reasons, but some people game the system. The people looking for opioids for non-legitimate reasons often use them for depression, anxiety, and emotional numbness because of situations.

I’m first going to expose how easy they are to get. I went to the podiatrist, and after an operation, he gave me a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine. I knew this was a drug of abuse, so I only used them whenever I really needed them. I maybe took 5 out of the bottle of 30 over a span of months. I could’ve easily gotten addicted to these, so that was the reason I used them as sparingly as possible.

The media has recently given us information on why opioids are so often being abused. They have made statements that they are being used by addicts for depression. I’ve read that opioids have ¨a general numbing effect on both the body and mind¨. If you are going through rough patches of depression, it may seem like these drugs are perfect for you; they aren’t. ¨Some addicts gain tolerance and need more and more¨. This easily leads to an overdose, and ¨you can overdose much more easily if you take opioids with alcohol¨.

Mainstream media has also said that people use opioid painkillers to eradicate feelings of anxiety. Being that painkillers also numb emotions, people think it’s a good reason to take opioids. ¨Any use other than using painkillers for pain is considered abuse¨. Addiction can easily take over anybody, but people with anxiety that have access to opioids and also have no self-control, is a recipe for addiction. 

It’s scary how fast a doctor is to write you a prescription for opioids. ¨Many people get addicted even if they are legitimately being used for pain¨. On the other spectrum, there are the people who abuse them. Popular opioids such as OxyContin and Vicodin are all too frequently being misused by people who have emotional problems. People suffering from anxiety and depression with open access to opioids are at ¨high risk for addiction and dependence¨. One last note, if you get hooked and run out, ¨withdrawal is painful and could be deadly¨.

Going away to Boot Camp? That’s no where near a hard thought for me to fathom nor fear.
My wife having to wait to come with me? Slightly.

Coming off Suboxone, Klonopin & Valium? 
This is absolute hell for me.

Now I’m fearful that I’ll not pass my drug test at meps.
My last Suboxone use was today 8mg with “tapering” days in between.
And my last dose of Klonopin was about 5-6 days ago roughly 2mg; my last dose of Valium was 4-5 days ago at 40mg.

Now I’ve read that Benzodiazepines (such as the ones I’m on) can take 4-6 weeks to fully get ride of the
 *drug metabolites* to be able to pass a urine test. 
Now I don’t know how true or not that is but I’ve been put on Ativan at the age 13, went on Valium a little over a year ago, and added Klonopin in less than a year ago.

Now the thought of losing my whole future to my past drug abuse to opioids/being on maintenance medication really, really scares the hell out of me.

Ended up having to stay in hospital for over a week because I'd aspirated so much spew that without constant supplementary oxygen I was in danger of hypoxia, I was on IV antibiotics and a constant drip of saline because I somehow had an acute kidney injury from dehydration (I was lying on the ground for almost four hours before I was found, I have no idea how I'm alive. Just lucky someone was in the house and heard the death rattle and came to check on me). I also managed to fuck my face up by lying on it for almost four hours, luckily it wasn't broken but I had a lot of soft tissue damage and my jaw swelled to the point where I couldn't even open my mouth wide enough to fit a sandwich in. It was incredibly painful and obviously the docs wouldn't give me anything stronger than paracetamol.

&#x200B;

Anyway, as soon as I got out of hospital I was back to smoking a gram of H a day. Did that for a few months, then a couple of months ago, on a whim, I went to my local needle exchange and got a goody bag. I'm deathly afraid of needles but it was scarily easy to jam the needle into the crook of my arm and from then on I was off to the races. (Please do not start injecting heroin on a whim, it is a lot easier than you think and once you get it good luck stopping)

&#x200B;

(Now we finally get to the point)

&#x200B;

So I'd been using the vein in the crook of both elbows (think it's called the medial something something vein), but I was starting to get a fair amount of scar tissue, to where it started worrying me because it was difficult to get the spike in, so I decided to hit the back of my hand. Obviously I missed and now I have a bump that's about 3cm in diameter and feels like I have a golf ball under my skin. It doesn't hurt, I've been to a doctor and shown them it and they said it looks OK right now but to keep an eye on it. That was last week though and there's been no improvement or worsening. I'm just worried it's going to get infected, which would suck because I've been clean for almost two weeks. Just when I think I'm out, they drag me back in.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: missed a shot, 3cm raised, hard bump under skin, no pain. No improvement or worsening over a period of a few weeks. Should I worry about an abscess forming, and what can I do to help my body break down whatever it's trying to seal off?",1537140023.0

But nobody really talks about a muscle relaxer that is also antihistamine I have mentioned in the past that is good for potentiating opiates. 

This otc medication is called orphenadrine. Based on multiple studies it can be used to ease withdrawal. Has been reported to give slight euphoria and when taken in conjunction with opiates patients have reported it helps the opiate ""find the pain better"" meaning orphenadrine in conjunction with opiates increases the analgesic relief.  

I took a few days off methadone mainly for a  bit of a tolerance break and this eased the hot and cold sweats and sick feelings really effectively. Also a 200mg dose at bed time really assisted sleep. Just thought I would mention it because I havent seen it on guides for opiate withdrawl before. ",1537120734.0

I usually don't dream at all when using, but it seems to really be on the nights I am cutting back or trying to slow down.

As a kid I was always into sports - soccer, baseball, basketball.. and my family, esp my dad, was always so supportive. Had a few coaches along the way that were so incredible a few turned out being like family to me, as well as my parents. I never even stumbled onto pills until after I had graduated high school, right before college. Its been so many years now.. 8 or 9.. that its really become my life (as would be putting so much time into anything for a decade). Really been struggling lately to break it off for real and for good, even though I see it within reach - a decent car, saving money, I actually have pretty much come to 0 on my debts and bills. I need to just take that extra push and save all of a few of my paychecks and I will be right where I need to be.

So onto the point, I've been having these surreal, vivid dreams where I am very young, about 10, at a sports tournament.. but I can never seem to get the strength to even get past the pre-game talk I am so focused on trying to get dope so that I am able to play. The first one was an indoor soccer tournament and I was struggling so hard to get the money together it was pure panic and I woke up before being able to. Next, a basketball one where this time was waiting on a dealer that I woke up before he ever came. Now last night was a baseball tournament where, with a coach that is like a father to me, I gave up defeat admitting to him and my parents there that I needed help and couldn't do it anymore. But that to play in the tournament I just needed to get well right then and that I was so sick my body was dying.

It's crazy and drugs were never, ever on my radar until much longer in life.  But my body combining the good, younger days, with this devil I've been caught under for almost the past decade.

So around 5 months ago I was really sick and had bronchitis I think and in my country the cough medicine (prescribed) is heavily regulated and I've tried to get it couple times when I had minor cough and the doctors don't prescribe it.

&#x200B;

Its good shit, there was 3.10 mg of codeine per 1 ML, and I had a 200 ML bottle. So the whole bottle had more than 600mg codeine and it also had efedrine 1.25mg/ml and a little bit of alcohol like cough syrups do.

I took a 30 ML dose, so around 30mg of codeine and I already felt a little effect, not much but at least my cough went away. I decided to redose and took 30mg more, so now im at 60mg. I got a little more itchy and more of a body high, and I felt a lot more positive. 30mg more and I already felt pretty high. My body was feeling really good, I was able to focus on   a game I was playing and music sounded pretty fucking good. Only on 90mg.

Highest I did was 120mg and that had me on my bed doing nothing but listening to music, whole body feeling just perfect. I remember trying to eat or drink and it all tasted shit I just wanted to relax. I also got itchy as fuck, but I didnt bother me.

Left my ex some time ago and we haven’t spoken much about anything for a year. Recently let him back into my life and see how completely addicted he has become. Carrying drugs and needles and spoons in his lunch box, doing meth just to wake up every morning, shooting up H at work idk how many times a day or night. Mixing it sometimes.. the “goofball” or whatever it’s called. I don’t know all of  it. He told me he’s overdosed 8 times. He acts like he did it on purpose. He says he knows how much he can handle and he wont overdose again. the first day I was with him was good but he got a little weird/paranoid. It scared me a little because the things he was saying was just so off and not like him. The second day he was in a great mood, talkative, loving. The third day I had to care for him 4+ hours during what I thought could end up as an overdose, I took care of him as well as I could. 

In the beginning, before we split, he had a severe alcohol problem. or so I thought but it was actually cocaine as well, I had no clue. It has apparently progressed to this. And continues worsening. 

I told him I can’t have him around as it is just too dangerous. I told him I love him. I told him I’ll support him in any efforts he’d make for recovery and getting the help he needs and taking steps to go into rehab, etc. he said he’ll go to rehab Monday. (tomorrow) I doubt he’s going to go, he said he can’t do inpatient. I didn’t ask him to go or anything but That’s what he said. He begged me not to leave him. I feel like he’s desperately reaching out for help but doesn’t want to quit. 

Last night he said that he has nothing else to live for so he doesn’t see the point in quitting. He said if he had his kids back then he’d quit. I told him how backwards that it is. He was using heroin for the little time while they were in his care anyways and he lost them for that reason. That’s just his addiction talking I know but it breaks my heart and I fear he will die soon. I’m very concerned but what else can I do. Nothing. It’s such a bummer. He was my best friend, the only man I have ever loved. He has a lot of potential. But I feel that he isn’t even a person anymore. Just an empty shell of what he used to be. 

He’s been using H for a year and he’s lost everything. His wife. Kids. House. All his money. A couple cars. His job. His freedom. He looks really sick. Everything is gone to the point where he is homeless and luckily now he’s at least able to sleep on a floor at a friends house and find a ride to work. Like at one point does anyone decide to quit? I am so scared that he’s going to die. He’s been at rock bottom for awhile. 

Anyways I just wanted to vent a little. I know this is the opiate group but I thought if anyone understood it would be you guys. I probably sound crazy or obsessed idk I’m just worried. Please delete if this kind of post isn’t welcome. I’m just going to continue to be here for him to talk to and I’ll help him if i can but I don’t wanna get myself involved in this disastrous cycle he’s in. ",1537103105.0

TL:DR- Want to ask psych to up dose from 90 to 120 bars (max prescribed dose) per month and also an adderall prescription.  Should I ask for both at the same appointment? Or should I ask for one of those things at a time between two appointments? 

Background: Okay so I first started seeing this psych after multiple people I knew went to him and had success. First appt I walked out with a script for 90 2mg xanax a month. This was back in October of 2016. Over the time since then i had asked and he switched me to klonopin 6 mg/day and another time he switched me to Valium 30 mg/day at my request. When I asked to go back on xanax he in so many words said it’s 100% up to me which one I want and he didn’t care. So I went back on 90 bars a month back in February. Now I know he’s prescribed people adderall and xanax before but I don’t think they were prescribed as high a dose as I am. My reservations for asking to up my xanax dose are that it’s already pretty fucking high and 120 would be the max he could rx. My reservation for asking for adderall is I’m not confident he would go for it. Worst he could say is no but I’m wondering if I should ask for both an increase and the addy script in the same appt or if I should ask for one before the other and in what order. Honestly this doc is very liberal I wouldn’t be surprised if he prescribed oxy for neuropathy or some shit.

Just wondering if anyone has advice on how/if the timing to ask for these things matters",1537082108.0

I now really need to but I’m very afraid: Should I tell my wife?,"**UPDATE: I TOLD MY WIFE EVERYTHING**

**I'm still married and she has no plans to divorce me but it's clear this is going to mess with our relationship for a while. She is worried much like I was worried she would be and I suppose what now bothers me the most about having told her is that every time I have talked to her since the subject is brought up and she has more questions and concerns. Clearly it is slightly better to now have this all out in the open and she does have genuine empathy for my struggle with depression and I think can help me. Certainly when I feel the world would be better off without me I have someone to talk to now unlike before. Thanks to everyone that gave me the benefit of their best advice and helped me to find the courage to get this done.**



TLDR: My lifetime supply of fentanyl was lost in a freak accident and now I have to start subs which are only available daily in the methadone line at the pharmacy so my dear wife is sure to find out sooner or later, asking if I should tell her and more importantly the best way to do so if I must?

It’s something that’s been troubling me a lot more than usual lately: I’m a secret addict. I apologize for the length of this post but as much as I appreciate people’s opinions and find the collective consciousness of this forum very helpful, I don’t think your opinion will be as helpful to me as it perhaps could be if it isn’t based on the right context and considerations so a little background is really required.

I went to seek help and told an addictions counsellor about my problem (quite a few months ago now)  but before that there was absolutely no one in the world (except for random people on the Internet like yourself who is currently reading this) that knew anything of my problem. I’ve been opioid dependant off and on for 30 years but it’s gotten worse in the last couple of years and I’ve been dependant 100% of the time in the last year. I used opioids to control depression on an as required basis for 30 years but 15 years ago when I was married it had been at least 10 years of nothing, no opioids or depression so I really thought I was done with it at the time. 

It’s almost a cliche that I ended up using heroin as a less expensive alternative to prescription medication and more recently when that became too expensive to be sustainable I started using pure fentanyl hydrochloride directly. Several years ago my heroin started testing positive for fentanyl but I had no choice to use it (carefully). As I was using fentanyl anyways, even if I didn’t want to, it only made a certain amount of sense to investigate and learn if I could use it more directly. While far from ideal for my purposes it is better for me than heroin in so many ways and it is of course a lot less expensive than daily heroin (pennies per dose).

In the beginning (over 30 years ago) I was pretty naive and seriously believed I had the flu the first couple of times I got dope sick.  It was so long ago I don’t really remember now but I would remember having run out of what I needed and that just wasn’t the case because I remember those few times during which that happened very clearly. So I was dope sick and really had no idea, if I had only known I likely would have just dosed to abort the withdrawal syndrome but I hadn’t yet connected the dots (30 years ago) that I had become dependent, rather I had just stopped using by choice to see if my depression would return and coincidentally thought I got the flu at around the same time.

I’ve never directly lied to my wife unless you count not telling her about my increasingly serious problem with opioid dependency as a lie or the fact that I suffered from depression some 10 years before we met but hadn’t had any trouble since as a lie which I know some people absolutely will. If she ever directly asked me in such a way that it was not possible to give her a truthful answer without lying I’m know I would tell her the truth. It was really difficult for this addictions counsellor to understand how I could have the problem for so long and no one knew but here’s the thing, I don’t get high, I just dose enough when I have to that sends my depression into full remission (almost as effective as a light switch) and then I would simply stop dosing, usually well before dependence developed.

I have some insight into how she might react to this (very badly) because not long after we were married (and before the depression returned) I had a problem with alcohol dependence (fortunately dependence and not addiction, there is a difference) which developed after my parents both died and I was stupidly using alcohol as a sleep aid. While this alcohol dependence was developing, my wife would never forget to prepare a rather stiff drink for me at bedtime, to help me sleep. She was as naive as I was about the danger. I would drink only at bedtime, wake up the next morning renewed and refreshed go off to work without fail.

Eventually one evening I came to my senses and resolved to stop doing this to my liver as the amount required to help me to sleep was ever increasing and clearly getting out of control but it was already too late, I couldn’t sleep. I started to sweat and soon developed nausea, vomiting and a rapid heart beat.  Sitting in front of my computer at 4 or 5 AM (dial up modem Internet in those days) and trying to figure out what was wrong with me I researched my list of symptoms and “Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome” appeared on my monitor. I remember I sat there frozen and in a daze, staring at it for the better part of an hour before it sank in that this was likely what was wrong. The means to confirm my amateur diagnosis was pretty simple so I drank some gin and very soon felt much better. The next day I couldn’t believe how stupid I had been to allow this to progress so far. I researched how to fix it, obtained the required amount of valium (diazepam) to substitute for alcohol, created a spreadsheet with a taper protocol to dose a slowly decreasing amount of diazepam every 6 hours over the course of 7 days (5 was recommended as sufficient but I wanted to be sure) and had the serious talk with my wife as to what had happened and how we were going to fix it. She wanted me to go to inpatient detox but this was exactly what they would do for me there and I didn’t want the embarrassment of anyone else in the world knowing how badly I had screwed up or how stupid I had been.  I had lots of paid sick time at my job and anything less than 10 concurrent days didn’t require a medical certificate but I still used vacation time to do this as I didn’t feel I should be taking paid sick time to treat a self inflicted wound. I took a week off from work and she was a trooper, waking me up and giving me the medication I had self prescribed in strict accordance with the protocol over the next week. After it was over, I went to a good number of AA meetings at my wife’s request but I simply couldn’t relate to the people there, I wasn’t an alcoholic and had no urge to drink, rather I had just become alcohol dependant because of my ignorance and no longer was but my wife was absolutely terrified. Only after we went on a number of Caribbean vacations where all inclusive (already included or free) alcohol was excessively abundant and she noticed that I drank responsibly did she seem to stop worrying herself sick that I was an incurable alcoholic. 

A couple of years after we had put this behind us my depression returned which was obviously very disturbing to me but I knew what I could do about it and of course I did. Perhaps the relative ease at which I had put alcohol dependence behind me played a role here as well. Ok, not perhaps, it definitely did. I was still very naive and probably felt at the time that if I did become dependent on opioids I could simply replace it with something else or slowly taper down the dose and leave it behind me as easily as I did with alcohol and even as I had been able to do with opioids in the past but of course I was incredibly stupid and obviously very wrong, fentanyl is a quite a very different animal.

As I started to realize the amount of money I was spending I starting taking steps to bring that under control. I learned that I could dose a lot less and still not be depressed. I was able to make what I had last longer. Of course like anyone, my tolerance increased and eventually the pills got too expensive and like so many I turned to heroin. I remember one of my early experiences with the wonderful warm euphoria of heroin and thinking ""If this is all I ever get out of this life I might be fine with that"". I really didn’t get high very often. Sometimes I would go through several grams of heroin without getting high even once. Getting high wasn’t important to me -- having my life back was and I really found heroin too sedating. If I did push enough heroin to cause euphoria it was very short lived because all I wanted to do was to take a nap. I suppose if I hadn’t found heroin so sedating it really could have got me with a serious addiction but I really didn’t like it because of how tired it makes me feel. At some point all my new batches of heroin started testing positive for fentanyl. I really had no choice but to use them carefully and as I was using fentanyl even if I didn’t want to I started to investigate if it could be helpful directly. Eventually my tolerance increased and the heroin got too expensive so I started dosing pure fentanyl hydrochloride directly. It was a lot less expensive than daily heroin. It also isn’t useful for getting high (perhaps some of the analogs are but not fentanyl itself) but just using it (without getting high) was sufficient to keep me singing with the radio and not depressed.

When I met with an addictions counsellor I found out to my great dismay that In order to get into the buprenorphine program I have to give up my job (because it requires me to be able to fly the friendly skies) and that’s a pretty big decision I can’t make without involving my wife but I know from past experience that she will react badly and be worried and terrified all over again and I’m really having a hard time bringing myself to do that to her.

In my country, suboxone is treated the same way as methadone with no difference. I will have to go to the same pharmacy every day for the remainder of my natural life. After three months I will be able to get two additional doses friday for use on the weekend but the strict monitored dosing and urine testing goes on forever. The program costs something like $40/day in my area which is $14,600/year and without a job that’s a lot of money. There is just no way I get to disappear everyday at the same time for very long before my wife figures it out or worse jumps to the entirely wrong conclusion (she is always encouraging me to “Get a Girlfriend” but just the same that’s only because she wants what is best for me and I really think she’d be hurt if she knew I actually had one).

I know that my tolerance for fentanyl is increasing because it does take more now to control the depression and I also have some pain (likely from opioid-induced hyperalgesia) and I don’t want to continue dosing fentanyl for years.  I have only a small supply remaining and it is rapidly getting harder and much more risky to obtain (really impossible, not for lack of trying). 

The Intervention

Handling and mixing pure fentanyl hydrochloride is very dangerous. The amount required to keep me well for a week is pretty hard to see and doesn’t look like much of anything with the naked eye. To make it safer and easier to handle and mix precisely, I had dissolved my entire inventory into an aqueous solution, 1 liter of bacteriostatic water mixed with fentanyl hydrochloride to a concentration of 5mg/ml, so that one bottle was just about 10,000 strong doses or really a lifetime supply. This was usually stored safely in a cabinet in my office, the one room my wife knows to leave be (she knows she can do as she pleases to the entire rest of the house) and there are no children in our home. I stupidly left it out on the counter for a short time after mixing the required amount for the next two weeks (every two weeks I reduce by 5% when I am tapering) because I got interrupted before I finished. The door to the office must not have latched completely and one of my wife’s cats got in and knocked it off the counter. In a freak accident, it landed mostly upside down. The problem wasn’t discovered for several hours and 98% of it leaked into the thick pile carpet where it was unretrievable. Obviously, I am the world's dumbest idiot for leaving it out and not making sure the cap was on more tightly. In any event, the lifetime supply had become a couple of months supply and that was a couple of months ago.  I have spent quite a bit of time and effort trying to replace it but that is simply not meant to be.

I have been coasting along the last couple of months, dosing fentanyl each and every day but never enough to get high and tapering as much as possible and I am becoming increasingly aware that this simply isn’t going to end well. I know I allowed this to happen and I have to accept the consequences but I’m feeling pretty trapped and don’t know what to do. I know if I tell my wife she will either leave me or she will dig in and help but I’m really not sure which way she will go on that. With each passing day it becomes a slightly bigger problem. 

I know when I run out it will not be pretty, although I have been tapering as quickly as I can, there simply isn’t enough left to complete a taper and even if there was it’s likely my depression will return at some point (it pretty much always does when I am in acute withdrawal).  Suboxone is a better solution for me (stronger kappa which is associated with depression or rather the lack of it) according to the last 20 studies I have read on the matter.

Knowing this disaster is coming real soon now I’m not going down because I was too embarrassed, proud, or stupid to ask for help so I went to my Doctor and told him what was up. He was shocked of course, and then became very distressed and withdrawn saying he doesn’t want anything to do with it and referred me to the lady Doctor in change of the methadone program and I’m scheduled to start on that path next week. There is no heroin in my part of the world (just pills) and the stigma is so very strong here.

It’s a small town and as soon as I start standing in the methadone/suboxone line every morning she is going to know at some point. I know I can hold out for a while by picking a more distant pharmacy but it’s only a matter of time.  It’s easy to hide drug use when it has no effect on you (except the positive one of not having depression) but I can’t hide disappearing at the same time every day and not being able to travel for very long (the methadone Doctor said she’d call in prescriptions in distant cities for me but I simply don’t believe she can do that, I can’t even keep up with the travel schedule sometimes, it’s unrealistic to expect her to be able to). We have two cars but I still think it is wise to pick one within walking distance just incase. I know it’s likely better if she hears it from me but I’m losing my mind with worry that she will divorce me.  

Do you think I should tell her or just try my best for as long as I can not to get caught?  If you think I should tell her any thoughts on how best to do it (thus the reason for this crazy long dissertation so you know all the machinations)?  She was really frightened with the alcohol incident and to her (never having even seen heroin in her lifetime) this is likely to be much much worse.

The only comfort I have is I know that the end of my life will end my addiction (and my depression).",1537078183.0

I told them call the d-boy and make sure I can get more bc I'll be out if I give y'all each a point. So Aaron called him and d-boy said yeah come through in 30. Roommate gave me cash for his point, and Aaron is supposed to give me 2 points out of his sack. Then Aaron gets stuck on the phone with his crazy ex, and once he gets off he says he just dropped acid. So I said ""bro wtf, I need to get my shit tonight."" And roommate told me ""you act like you'll go through withdrawal or some shit."" Like yeah, I will. He's tryna tell me that since I smoke it, withdrawal isn't a thing to me. And now since it's been 2 hours since Aaron called the d-boy, he's not answering. So I suggested let's go through my guy, and Aaron said fuck him, he's not getting my money. So I guess since they got what they wanted, fuck whatever I need. So now I'm out of dope, and they're concerned about a.) Tryna set up some nigga that just robbed them, and b.)

I recently heard from family my brother is constantly asking for pain meds when he knows people have it. It pisses me off he can't just see my example and the fucked up rock bottom shit I went through and stay away from the garbage.

So, I've been using Oxycodone (~ 200mg p.d) and generally add in a benzo (Temazepam/Diazepam/Flunitrazepam/Midazolam etc) or a gabapentinoid (Lyrica) if I want to get super chill. 

I've been using opiates/benzos/gabapentinoids and others recreationally for the past year and thoroughly enjoying my life 😊

One thing that I have never experienced is a nod. I hear people talk about this all the time but for me up until now, its never happened. 

Well, this morning I took 10mg Diazepam, 600mg Lyrica and 60mg Oxycodone, brewed myself some Blue Mountain and had a chill day. 

This evening, I had chosen a great Prime show to watch (Mr Robot), had pizza and then took my Saturday night dose.

So, 1,200mg Lyrica and 80mg Oxycodone down the hatch. (No benzo BTW, however I am aware that my morning dose of both Lyrica and Diazepam may still be active)

Well, I was watching the show with my sister and suddenly got a tap on the shoulder. 'youve missed most of the first episode?! lol)

Apparently, I had nodded off. I awoke half way through the second episode feeling great lol.

I am still feeling great now. I am very cautious when it comes to mixing benzos with opiates however less so with Lyrica.

I have once again been reminded of how wonderful Pregabalin is. I love it!

Anyway, that has been my evening so far. 

I hope everyone is having a lovely evening 😊🤘🇬🇧",1537059442.0

I chipped some h and planned on taking half a bar, but I forgot the xan.

Luckily I had a couple 2mg etiz on me. I figured with my benzo tolerance it wouldn't be a problem. It's been awhile since I took any tiz so it hit me harder then I expected. 

I had a great high going but couldn't stop nodding. My boss just took it as I am just exhausted from all the work I've been doing. 

Just a few mins ago he asked me to come out side with him.  I didn't think much of it and wasnt worried about him questioning why I was so tired. 

He said he was amazed at the work I did. We were far behind the projects expected goal and the customer was starting to bitch.  He said he was so proud of me for getting us back on track even though it was taking so much of a toll on me. 

He told me that he Just sent my raise submission to HR and it will start before the end of next week.

Ok so anyway, this friend of mine (I use the term friend loosely) hit me up and mentioned he’s with his girl friend and she had 2 bags on her she was trying to sell, he said he’d sell it to me for $50. I jumped on it bc usually when I ask, he charges me double (we agreed on a mutual understanding that I’d buy him a bag if he could grab me one, because I don’t like going on the runs, so I have to trust that he comes back every time, and he always has so far. I think it’s fair - I’ll buy you a bag if you can grab me one, right? Well then it somehow became $50 extra, than $100 extra, basically just pushing it as far as he can.) Usually when I grab a bag off him, I pay double + more. So anyway, back to the story... I sent him the $50, he came by, dropped the bag off, and then I start smelling it, doing it and mixing it up, and realize the dopes a little off perhaps? Now, this isn’t my usual dope from my normal guy. However, I have tried this dope once before. it looked the same pretty much but Idk, it just had a weird consistency in the spoon this time. Kind of looked like clear mucus, Idk, lot of tiny little clumps in it too. I torched it just incase, and then there were little particles left behind, which duh makes sense, that happens sometimes with certain shit. Whatever. I do it, doesn’t feel like all that, kinda “eh” “so-so” not a nice rush or anything, which it had done in the past. Did it once more and still same reaction - “eh” “it’s alright.” Long story short - I’m wondering in the back of my head if it’s possible he put a little bit of baby powder or something in it to make it look like it’s more dope when it’s really not, ya know. I mean, why else would he be selling me a bag for $50 when usually he charges me double + some..?  I’m thinking, maybe he took some out for himself, mixed it with a little bit of baby powder, and sold me half or maybe less than half of a bag, and charged me $50. So for him, he’s basically making $50 off half a bag or less and then getting an actual hole bag for the same amount. Im very generous, but I’m even more skeptical. I have no idea what baby powder mixed with dope would even look like though? I tried googling it lol but uhhh... I cant really find nothin’ for “what does baby powder mixed with dope look like?” There’s nothing on here either, I checked! or maybe I didn’t look hard enough. 

Either way, do you know what baby powder mixed with dope looks like? Or how can you tell if ur dope is mixed with baby powder, or something of the sort? 

Any answers would be cool... Sorry I don’t have a pic... I did it all lol... and even if I do get any type of answers it’s all gone now... but for future reference it would be nice to keep an eye out for. ",1537057631.0

Went to the Dr's at 8 am on the Sunday, they checked me over and other than a low oxygen count he said I was fine and gave me some antibiotics, which I've saved for something useful(I get tonsillitis frequently). So this week I took the week off work to try and taper, costing a fortune in pay and feeling pretty bad about my poor attempy at stopping.

Today I decided to have a second attempt at it and I'm now getting that same chesty cough I had last week, I've got enough codeine to do a 50 % reduction over the week, back to work Monday no matter what. I feel stupid, I thought I was in control  and didn't do the smart thing and try a longer taper.

I know it's only codiene but I've not experienced this before, having done other drugs in my life, non have left me physically dependent like this, its quite amazing. 

I hope the chest thing is withdrawal and not something more serious, seems to be a lot of Tb coming to the UK from Asia etc.

about 5 min ago I snorted 3 big lines each about  .2- .3 of some good/fire dope, it was mixed. 2 lines were fire and 1 was real good dope but not such potent as the other two. I also took 2mg of etizolam which is the same as 1mg of Alprazolam. Thats what I learned here together with a bropiate. And I just wanted to thank you guys for. Everytime I come here I learn smth new or read some super interesting atory from someones day. I am more than grateful.that I am at the moment whether addicted to dope or to benzos. Thanks detox, mom, brother, friends and you guys for helping me staying ""sober"" I know that I sometimes use at the moment but it gets less and less everyday. Yesterday I had some real cravings while getting drunk with my friends and I didnt touched the dope just because of you teaching me how to handle cravings. I must say that I touched that night dope and snorted a .1 line but that was just because something really bad halpend to my best girlfriend amd I knew that dope will help me to forget it and that I can sleep and work today. I worked today 8 hours cutting trees, builiding walls(German walls with stones, IDK as far as I knoe most of you are from the USA and as far as I know there are most of the walls, not all, are made out of wood) so one stone has a weight of ca. 4kg and I lifted about 150-170 of them today. I am really groogy. But this day was a day where I didnt thought once about using because of the work keeping my head focused. And I didnt wanted that risk again doing such things with dope. The last time I did that while actively using and broke my arm and foot. So this was a great day. And I gave myself some small treat after such a hard day of musclework. I found a way with the help of you to do smth against my cravings its riding my bicycle. Thats great you helped me so often in the last 2 years when I was using and I sometimes asked some real stupid questions just because I was so high. Becauae of you I didnt started shooting dope. I just wanted to give you all a super big hug and a very grateful thank you for caring about me, listing to me if smth bad happened, just for every little thing you have done. This is a great Community and I never met any ppl here who were harsh or disrespectful. Ok there were some assholes too but they just said it like it needed to be said. And some dumb trolls but who cares about them. I send to everyone of you much love and respect for beeing the wonderful persons you are. You guys are great never forget that. If anyone needs help please pm me and I will.answer you and help you. Stay as you are and never let anybody tell you that you are scum or shit just because you are using. Its andisease and if you are ready you can start to fight against it. I will try the chipper way now a bit. Lets see. Maybe I am one of the thousand ppl who wont get addicted again and if I get addicted again I found a great way for me how to stop using. If anyone is interested in my way of detox that worked for me now 3 great times. I was 3 month clean before I relapsed the maximum amount I was sober in the 2 years before was one week and that was only because my dopeman got arrested and I am or was to shy and scarred to cold cop. So if anyone ever needs help just hit me up and we can write about everything. Even my PTSD got much better aince I stopped using now. So enough from my emotional post. I just had to get that off of my heart. I love you guys and gals. Stay safe. Please try to always carry narcan and not use alone like me and tell the others where your naloxone is. Its a lifesaver. I will always remember my one and gladfully only OD and I was alone and thank god I came back on my own. Always do a test bump or test shot. You can always take more not less and every life matters. Have a great day/night whatever time it is at yours. I will post some updates how it works out for me as a chipper and at the moment when I realize I am coming to near to addiction or am addicted again I will definitly get sober again. Thats for sure. Oh and I will write a book about a junkie in my age and in my country cause you can nearly find nothing about addicts in my age from my country. Only from the oldtimer junkies from the Heroin Epidemic in the 80s untill late 90s. So now its really enough from me you got better things to do than read this super long text.

That is, unlike injections of cocaine which produced a very distinct ""taste"" (I believe technically that it's a smell, since they say we only taste salty sweet, bitter, sour, and ""umami"" [Japanese word denoting tee sensation produced by foods that Americans would call *savory*, eg a rich bone broth]  IIRC, and all other taste sensations supposedly actually come from the nose and the sense of smell), varying directly with the quality and amount of cocaine (a very strong gasoline type ""taste"" [ie smell], probably partially due to solvents used in production, but i am pretty sure cocaine itself has that solvent taste to it).

Heroin, on the other hand,  had no taste as far as i was concerned.i do not remember ever noting a taste,  even a faint one,  while shooting tar or ECP in the early to mid-2000s.

Today, i definitely taste the ECP I get. I cant really describe the taste, and its not vinegary even when i have the good stuff that reeks of it, but it is a definite taste every time it's good, real dope (fent cut almost certainly in these stamps, but still good heroin with it).

Also, I'm on low dose subs, praise Allah, and I taste the taste, and it's always there even if it's partially blocked in the brain.

Have I changed or is it the dope? Maybe it the fent I'm tasting? Maybe I discounted the taste when I was young because it's relatively weak compared to coke even if I did taste it.

Has anyone else developed a more keen sense for the taste of a shot of dope?",1537029902.0

Lol","So you guys may remember me, and my story about trying to produce a sperm sample while high on oxy, and then my descion to get clean from everything after my sperm results came back really bad from all of my drug and alcohol abuse over the years. 

Since me and my girlfriend have been trying to have a child, the doctor basically told me I needed to get clean to be able to have a chance at getting her pregnant because my sperm count was horrible and I only had around 0.7% of active sperm when regular males are around 4%.  So I did. I got clean from everything and it's been about 2.5 months. I had a few relapses on alcohol but I have stayed away from cocaine, opiates and I even quit a 10year marijuana habit as well. 

I feel great, I am currently in school right now for my final year of electrical so I will be a master electrician in about 2 months. 

Me and my girl have been trying for a child for just about 2 years now, and nothing has worked but I also had not gotten of drugs and alcohol prior to two months ago and I was a decently heavy user of oxy, with occasional heroin, drinking 4-6 days of the week all the time  and snorting coke every weekend for years.

She missed her period this month and sure enough, the test came back positive.

Although this is still very early in the pregnancy and anything can happen over the next few months, I'm proud of myself for actually getting clean, and getting clean actually worked for us to conceive. This gives me even more motivation to STAY clean to raise this child and hopefully the pregnancy goes smoothly. Just wanted to update you guys on the situation if anyone cared. You all gave me lots of helpful advice and words of motivation and I still message with a few of you on here that have had my back when I wanted to relapse on heroin and I am truly grateful for that. I'm excited to be a father, and to be a sober father unlike my alcoholic father. I want to be the best dad I can be and I can only do that if I'm sober.

usually this plug sells dope that is really white/gray, chalky. quite obviously fent. the rush only lasts like 10 minutes and I start getting dopesick after like 4 hours. but its 40$ for a half g and I was dope sick.

so I went and copped a half g and I am pleasantly surprised to find that its brown!! hell yeah.

but anyways, I mixed some up in the cap of the rig line I always do but its like SUPER foamy.

when I draw it up its hella foamy inside the rig and idk what to do about it.

so far I've been shooting the foam, is that bad?? Isnt it bad for air to be injected in your veins? 

this foam has to be the result of whatever cut my plug put in the dope, because this doesnt usually happen but it has happened before. does anyone know what cut causes it to foam up like this? is it bad for you?

I am by no means attempting to game the system I am honestly trying to get clean and taper properly off the substance after a bit of maintenance has been achieved.

Well I'm pretty sure it's a lowered tolerance thing because I haven't taken anything in 61 hours and while I feel really shitty, it's no where near the withdrawals I'm used to. I have chills, sweats, mild RLS (gabapentin kills it pretty much completely), dizzy, emotional issues, but no stomach problems, no cramps, the joint aches are minimal, my back doesn't hurt like hell, I'm fucking SHOCKED. How in the fuck did a 2 week taper lower my tolerance this much? Fuck it, I'm not gonna ask questions.

His cheeks collapse around his teeth. The cherry ember glows orange and lights his face. He continues, but now, he speaks words made of smoke.

“Two years is an amazing feat, dude. Really, not many get there if you consider all the people who have ever tried to get sober. Almost none. Be proud of yourself.”

“Thanks. I am,” proud of what? I’m not sure. I just know it’s the right response.

“Call me tomorrow. We really need to get that fifth step done. I wanna see what’s up with your fourth so far. Just let me in on what’s holding you up. Gotta work the steps man. It works if you work it. It won’t if you don’t.”

“Okay. I’ll call you. Maybe we’ll get some coffee. See ya. Thanks again, Jerry.” We hug. He walks off. A blond girl whose nose and chin almost touch follows him to his car. They have something between them.

Another guy I know from the meeting taps me on the shoulder. He says he has tickets for a Mariner’s game next weekend and wants to know if I’d be interested in going. I tell him yes. We exchange numbers and walk our separate ways. I’m pretty sure I’m not going to make it to the game or even see Jerry, tomorrow. Relapse is like suicide. If you really want to kill yourself, you don’t tell anyone. You don’t even let people know it’s a possibility. You just do it.

The house smiles like a Jack-O-Lantern with a crooked mouth in the dark.

It has four apartments. Two upstairs. Two downstairs. Ours is on the bottom left. Through the front door, the hallway smells like pot smoke. It comes from the neighbor girl’s place. Her laugh and the muffled voices of a man in her apartment make me wish I was inside of the apartment with her. OK Computer is playing, song six. Karma Police. *For a minute there, I lost myself. I lost myself.*

The lights are always off at our place. An orange blast of stove light reaches into the living room from the kitchen. Dale sits on the couch with a wet towel over his face. He’s my roommate. Actually, he’s my landlord, because he’s the one who has his name on the lease and only invited me to rent the room to help him pay rent.

“Randy.”

“Dale. How’re ya?”

“Terrible.” He removes the towel. His cheeks are swollen like he has them filled with air.

“What happened?”

He shakes his head. There is hesitation to explain. I imagine he’s embarrassed by whatever happened to get him into this situation.

“Tried to dye my beard last night. Company must have changed the formula. Bad allergic reaction.” Dale is gay. You wouldn’t know that, but he is.

“Whoah.”

“Yeah.” He holds the towel to his face and walks to the sink. He flings the spoon and milk ringed glass I left in the sink that morning at me. It shatters. He screams and curses. There are many unopened prescription bottles in medicine cabinet behind the bathroom mirror. They all have his and other names on them. Lithium. Depakote. Prozac. Celexa.  I never know when one of his episodes is coming on.

Dale wears a clean white t-shirt and shuffles a worn pair of close toed slippers across his afghan rugs. They are propped up on the end of the couch now. His head rests at the other. He grunts and exhales dramatically. I sweep up the glass with the broom and pan and clean the spoon before placing it in the dishwasher. It’s better when I’m in my room. He never bothers me there.

Once I hear his door closes for the night, I sneak out to the front steps for a smoke. Party lights blink in the neighbor’s window. Something’s playing but is softer now and unrecognizable. She’s probably having sex with whoever I heard laughing through the door earlier. I was nothing special to her. That’s okay, though. Neither is she. Well, that’s what I tell myself. I roll the cherry out of my cigarette and flick it toward the street. A raindrop falls on my forehead as I walk back in. I think of Jerry and the fourth step, then Sal and the relapse before I fall asleep.

Dale is up when I come into the kitchen to cook breakfast.

He holds another wet towel to his face and mutters in the dark of the living room and tells me he’s going to the hospital. I nod. He shows me his face. The red lumped cheeks have wept an oily mucus overnight now dried in a green crust on his skin. His mouth is puckered and small from the swelling.

“Yeah. Maybe they can give you a cortisone shot or at least some oral steroids to help with the allergic reaction.”

“Maybe.” Dale says through his teeth.

The door shuts behind him, and he gets into his white Ford Explorer through the front window. I pour a cup of coffee and open the fridge to pull out the can of Spam from the morning before covered in tin foil and a diet Dr. Pepper. This has been my morning routine for months. Black coffee and diet Dr. Pepper while I fry up some Spam.

When I was a kid, we never ate it. Probably because it smells like dog food before it’s cooked, but someone fried it up one time and shared it with me at the halfway house I lived in right after rehab. I never looked back.

Maybe, it’s not healthy to eat so much Spam. I think to myself. A half can every morning. For a moment images of my own ballooned feet retaining water flip through my head while the grease pops in the pan. Then, I begin to tell myself a story. I call it, The Attack of the Spam Babies. It’s about the pandemic of parasitic creatures which evolved from sodium molecules and preservatives in the canned meat product. They incubate themselves like tiny bugs at first just under the host’s skin. A person might confuse them with blisters or mosquito bites for a while, but as they grow, the bumps get as big as grapefruit. Inside, malignant fetuses kick and turn the way babies do, but when they come to term, they crawl out of the human’s mouth and devour them like the giant, hybrid larvae of a wasp or botfly made of Spam. Everyone is infected. The world is being taken over by these creatures. It plays like a low budget, horror/sci-fi flick from the sixties in my mind.

Then, I think about my diet Dr. Pepper and wonder if drinking so much aspartame is as bad for me as they say. I looked it up once. According to the FDA and all peer reviewed studies, aspartame has no negative side effects unless it is consumed in impossibly large quantities. Also, people who have an ailment called phenylketonuria can have problems with it, but belief in aspartame being so unhealthy is believing that the FDA and several other organizations have conspired to falsify the results of the tests, that they are hiding the proof of detrimental side effects for a profit. I wouldn’t put it past them.

I’m no stranger to conspiracy theories. Dale fed me several the first few weeks I lived with him. He might be considered a rightwing nut job. I don’t know, but whatever he is, some of it rubbed off on me. When I called my mom and the old man she’s married to, I would tell them about Pizza Gate or the Kardashian family belonging to the illuminati and how Bruce Jenner’s transition to Caitlyn Jenner tied into all of that. It wasn’t that I believed it as much as I was just sharing the information.

They never appreciated it. My mom had already dragged the old man into paying for my psychotherapy sessions between the ages of 11 and 13. I went because I had become extremely antisocial. Anytime I found myself in a public setting or talking to someone, my mind would automatically blast me with visceral imaginations of whoever was talking to me while they sat on the toilet, like I could smell the way their guts digested their dinner and see their bowel movements in all its different consistencies, black and greasy silt or crumbled chunks of brown clay or painful strings of a slimy yellow snot. I could hear the wet plops and their red-faced groans. It was crippling.

After two years of therapy and 20,000 dollars later, it went away. I just grew out of it. Therapy did nothing. I told my mom and the old man what it was all about after that. They didn’t seem impressed. Years later, when I got out of rehab and started telling them about conspiracy theories over the phone they asked me where I got those ideas. My mom asked me if I wanted to go back to therapy. They wondered if it was just something newly sober addicts went through. I haven’t seen them since they sent me to live with my dad in the city at 15.

Oh, well. I think, chewing my spam now. My shirt is off. There is a paisley shaped blister of bubbled skin on my stomach where grease popped out of the pan yesterday and burned me. I press it with my thumb. Clear liquid leaks out of it and rolls through the hair above my belly button.

“Spam Baby.” I whisper.

Leaves pop with fall of heavy rain drops in the tree out front.

It’s not raining. Not really. It’s not even drizzling, but the day is gray, and there are a few rain drops falling from the sky. I just don’t consider it raining. Others might. Other’s probably do, but one thing’s for certain. I need a raincoat with me in case it does start pouring.

The only raincoat I own is hiding somewhere. I pick through the piles of clothes on one side of my room and fling them against the opposite wall. It’s a form of sifting, and while it makes the room even messier than it was before, it does allow me to find things. Five minutes pass. I’m sweating and breathing hard. Finally, the yellow sleeve of my raincoat shows itself. It is sticking out from under a large plastic bin full of books I’ve read. The creased jacket slides out from underneath the weight of the book bin with a pull of the sleeve. I tie it around my waist as I walk out the front door. It’s raining oustide, now.

Our neighbor’s dryer vent blows hot scents of fabric softener into the driveway. Her husband’s truck leaks motor oil and diesel onto the wet concrete, and I walk through smells of pine bark mulch and fresh raindrops falling in the dirt where their yard had to be dug up for a busted pipe. There is no movement or sound on our block but my footsteps on the asphalt in the pale morning light. At the corner, a man with a black bandaged hand and head gestures and jabs the air declaiming like some diseased prophet.  His eye wanders. It rambles wildly as if it is an autonomous organism with its own distinct intentions and preoccupations, an insect which has bore a hole in the man’s face and made it its home. He yells at me as I pass.

“You have been called, boy! You have been called, but you have not answered! Your time is up. This day will be your death. Hell has place for you yet! Yes! It has place for you yet!”

Fear rolls through my biceps and the insides of my wrists. The fear is that this strange encounter might turn into a physical altercation. I wouldn’t want to hurt him. More than that, though, I don’t want to get hurt or infected with whatever he might have.

He’s crazy. I tell myself. Crazy or not, the words hit me hard. I know exactly what he’s talking about. It’s as if his crazy rambling is not crazy at all but actually the emission of some eternal and infinite intelligence warning me away from the path I’m taking. This is the first time I’ve thought about Sal and the gift he’ll be giving me shortly on the train, if he comes through and if I see him. The decision is death, and I know it. The decision is death, and it’s one I make willfully.

The train ride is cold.

The rain has moistened my shirt and pants enough that the cool insides of Sounder car are miserable. I stare at a mother and her son in the seat across from me. He is a grown man but can’t take care of himself. His face looks to have been smashed by the orifice that squeezed it out decades prior to today. The chin and head are small. Primitive eyebrow ridges call back to the rim of the cratered rock which held the fabled primordial soup, the accidental slop from which all life crawled forth. He spits a chunk of half chewed bread at the window. Strands of saliva stick from his mouth to the glass. He laughs, and his mother coos and clucks rubbing his shoulders like a momma bird soothing her babies in the nest. The scene has made me sick and angry this morning. I decide then that his life is the argument for eugenics and maybe, I’m not as opposed to it as I thought.

Someone slaps my shoulder. It’s Sal. He is shooing me over making sweeping gestures away from himself with the backs of his hands. I scoot over.

“Sah?” He says and swings into the seat. It’s funny to him to say it so absurdly.

“Sup, bro?” I don’t mean to, but I am rubbing my hands.

“Bro! Put your tongue back in your mouth! Haha! You’re looking like a fiend.” I don’t appreciate his comment, but he’s right. Besides that, he’s got the power over me this morning in a baggie in his pocket or wherever he’s holding it. “How ya going to do it?”

“I don’t know.”

“What do you mean you don’t know?”

“Bro. I haven’t thought that far. I’m just going to see it for now. I’ll decide how when I get there.”

“Fair enough.”

“So?”

“So, what?” He laughs.

“Let’s see it!”

“See what?” He laughs again.

“C’mon, man.”

“C’mon, what?”

“Whatever.” I turn away and look out the window. The sky is black. Everything is wet and getting wetter.

“Aight. Aight. Here you go, man. Don’t throw a fit, huh?” He reaches down and tugs on the cuff of his jeans. There’s a square fold of paper in his sock. Sal pulls it out. “You know, I ain’t really one for lying, and I ain’t really one for giving out stuff for free. I was thinking all last night that I should just make you pay for it.” He holds it out. I reach for it, and he pulls it back from me. Sal hands it to me.

I unfold the piece of paper. Inside, there is a wax baggie. It is stamped with the letters D.O.A. in black ink. This is the kind of packaging I have seen pictures of and heard about from a couple I lived with in New Mexico in my twenties. They were from Atlantic City and told stories of the girl turning tricks for tourists she met on the boardwalk. They bought bundles, which were supposed to be ten bags, but they got 11 from their dealer. I always wanted to see what they were talking about and try it. Here it was right in front of me.

“D.O.A?” I ask.

“Dead on arrival.”

“Looks like there’s barely anything in there.” I am accustomed to dime and even nickel sized boogers of black goo stuck to square cut pieces of trash bag in a balloon.

“Yeah, man. That’s what I was asking how you’re gonna do it for. This stuff should be deadly. Better than anything you’ve ever tried.”

“Well, yeah. You said it’s of a brick a bunch of Vietnamese dudes had in an apartment. I mean. They probably don’t get their stuff from some dude of the corner.”

“No. They don’t. They said they get it from an old man. I’m guessing some family or something from back east. I don’t really know, but they ain’t playing around. That’s for sure. Barely speak English, man.”

I nod. We sit in silence a moment.

“I’m prolly gonna snort it. I don’t have a rig.”

He nods. “Get at me, if you want more.”

“How?”

“Facebook.”

“Facebook? I don’t have one.”

“Who doesn’t have Facebook?”

A number of paranoid thoughts enter my mind. Government surveillance and information collection are thoughts for a second. My drug use. My criminal history. Things like that. “Me. I guess.”

“Why not?”

“Dude. A lot of reasons.” I raise my voice. The mother of the disabled son raises her scarfed head to look. Sal and I have been very quiet up to now. “I had it for a few months after I got sober. Made friends with all the people I went to high school with. They’re all doctors and lawyers and have children. I’m living in the back of some psychopath’s apartment paying way too much money with a crappy job and just got sober at 32. I got tired of reading about lonely old ladies’ urinary tract infections and body image issues. You know? I knew them from N.A. and A.A. It was like, why are you posting about this? It looks pathetic. Just like when people post their sad dinner pictures. Are you really that sad and lonely? Are you really posting a picture of the salad you just made and the crusty tortilla you’re about to eat? Wow! I don’t care. A bunch of political propaganda and warnings of supposed pedophile rings using certain ads to lure their victims and all that crap. My mom’s sister-in-law and this crazy hippie chick I met at C.A. meeting once went off, bro, I mean they WENT OFF on each other on one of my posts, arguing about breastfeeding in public and whether that’s acceptable. Dude, my post had nothing to do with that. It’s just like it’s a place where people freak out on each other over nothing or make public announcements about how they’re freaking insane or sad and lonely.”

“Hmm.”  He turns his head to the side as if thinking. His bottom lip is pushed up.

“And get this, yo. Get this! You know what the worst part was, Sal? Guess. Just guess. It was that I was doing all of these same things. Me, bro! I had to get rid of it.” I am screaming. Another passenger laughs at what I’m saying. Sal holds his hands out.

“Aight, bro. Aight. Calm down. Man. You’re tripping out on me. Making a scene.” He laughs a little. “But, look, check it out. I need you to get a hold of me. Search for Sal Emmanuel Garcia. I’m the only on in this city on Facebook with that name. I’ll come right up. Just make an account and get at me. Remember, I just gave that to you so you can tell me what’s up with it. I already know it’s fire, but you gotta keep your end, now.”

“Okay. Sal Emmanuel Garcia. Got it.”

He rides with me for another few stops. We bump knuckles, and he gets off. I look at the baggie once more before folding it back up in the paper and sliding it into the breast pocket of my raincoat. My clothes have dried some. The heater must be on in the car. It’s warmer. I get off in a few stops.

I valet park cars in a garage at one of the hotels downtown.

My boss is a large Samoan with a thyroid gland that is currently trying to kill him by leading his entire endocrine system and vital organs in full blown mutiny against him. He speaks like Eeyore and wears the same khaki pants and blue collared shirt as I do for my uniform. We talk about his divorce and how that’s going.

“She’s still living with me though. It’s awkward.”

“Well, yeah. Didn’t you say she’s sleeping with someone else?”

“Yeah.”

“Is he sleeping with her at your house?”

“Yeah.”

“Why? Dude, you should have more respect for yourself than that.”

“I love her, man.”

“Okay. But that’s not the same thing as having to disrespect yourself.”

“It’s hard to explain. She is struggling financially.”

“Whatever.”

I turn away from him and lean onto the valet kiosk. The things he’s just told me disgust me. Everything about him is ridiculous. The way he talks. His depression. The way he lets his ex-wife use him. I have moved the baggie from the folded piece of paper into my pants pocket and finger it from time to time. A customer walks up. I write the ticket and take the keys. I park the car. I wait at our desk and do it again when the next one comes. Finally, it’s a quarter past four. If I walk back to the desk slowly, this old lady handing me her keys will be the last one for the day.

The inside smells like expensive perfume and new car. It is basically a Toyota Landcruiser, but Lexus’s 2016 version of it with leather interior and beautiful woodgrain panels. Everything is automatic. It has all the bells and whistles. The gold emblem in the steering wheel represents a world of things I don’t understand and never will. My mom does. The old man she’s with buys them for her.

I find a dark corner of level three in the garage. It is quiet. No one is around. I pop open the center console and find an owner’s manual in it. The wax baggie is flimsy in my fingers but stiffens enough when I press the sides to open its mouth. Fuzzy granules fall onto the glossy cover. I can barely see what’s there in the dark. An old Wal Mart gift card with an irrelevant amount of change left on it makes a poor line of the substance. It looks like a much smaller imitation of the smallest ship from the game Battleship or maybe a woodlouse. I roll a dollar bill up and snort it.

The powder burns, even though there’s almost nothing there. My eyes water. A nasty chemical taste hits the back of my tongue. I lean back onto the head rest and breath. My nasal cavity still stings. I can’t tell how long passes, but I am guessing that it is something like a couple of hours by the way my boss is frantically banging on the window.",1536955174.0

The dope quality had been going down for months and i was thinking of quitting due to the fact i couldn't find any real good heroin. Then one day i sniffed a 4 bags and within 20 minutes my heart was RACING. literally close to 300 bpm a minute. My entire body was shaking violently and my vision was blurred to fuck due to my eyeballs shaking too. i told myself if i didn't get better in an hour i would call 911. I was utterly terrified. It did go away in an hour and i was ok.

I have come to the conclusion it was heroin cut with clenbuterol mainly due to this article [http://today.uchc.edu/headlines/2005/aug05/heroin.html](http://today.uchc.edu/headlines/2005/aug05/heroin.html)

It scared me off dope for well over 2 year and now i cant use without worrying about this. Has anyone else come across this? also my buddy who smokes it did not notice these effects. It seems it has to be sniffed or shot. 

The heroin also tasted floral but also bad. kinda like rotten flowers

horrifying. 

any one else have the misfortune of getting this stuff?

I want to thank you all for giving me insight and helping with my questions.

I ended up going cold turkey starting Monday morning this week.

I took clonidine .2mg and 6 loperamide 2mg 4x a day for the first 2 days, then clonidine 3x a day with 4 loperamide on Wednesday. 

On Thursday morning, I took one last clonidine and that was it. 

I slept a LOT.  I was exhausted (I think because of the clonidine), and the dry mouth from the medication was the absolute worst.

But today, I woke up with energy and a new outlook on my future.  I FEEL FUCKING GREAT!

I don't know if I am the norm, but I feel very fortunate that I didn't feel any of the withdrawals like I did years ago when I tried to quit.  I think on Wednesday night I had about an hour in the late night where my legs felt restless, but besides that I didn't cough, sneeze, no runny nose, no yawning, no aching, no headache.  Just tired, and again, I think that was the clonidine.

I am sure that the positive desire to be done with this is also a factor in how I feel.  I have NO DESIRE at all to go back to the way things were.  It was such a wonderful feeling to wake up this morning at 7AM and I was alert and ready to go.  I can't count how long it has been that I would wake up in the morning and drag myself out of bed, just to get out to the garage where I kept my stash of pills so I could get one in my system and feel I could then start the day.

I find that I unconciously still touch my pocket to check to make sure I have a pill there for my day.  I am guessing that that muscle memory will take some time to break, but it sure is great to know that I can take off my pants and not constantly worry that I may have left a pill in there for my wife to find, or, God forbid, a pill falls out of my pocket on the ground for others to see and question.

THE LIE IS OVER!  And I am really looking forward to the new me.

Thank you all again, I will probably still lurk here, and if I can be a strength and help to others, that would be the least I can do.

For those of you out there that are ready.  YOU CAN DO THIS!  Have the positive mental attitude and if you want, use my mantra:

*better every day*

God Bless you all.  And thank you again.",1536940112.0

I decided to hit in the crook of my arm- you know, the inside of the elbow. I don't hit there often, thus that is where my vein Old Faithful lies. I insert the needle, register and everything seems to be going fine. I'm in the vein, no issues yet.

When I pushed the plunger in it felt like I injected fire into my veins. It shot all the way up my forearm and into my hand. I quickly pulled the needle out and started rubbing my burning itchy arm. 

What happened next convinced me my arm was going to need to be lopped off. My forearm, wrist and hand swelled. My hand was the worse. It swelled 3-4times its original size. I couldn't make a fist and the skin was pulled so tight it felt like it was going to rip open. 

What happened? Any ideas? Has this ever happened to anyone else? After 2-3 days my hand went back to normal. I didn't seek medical advice because after a couple of hours the swelling started to go down. It looked almost like an allergic reaction.- like a giant hive.

I'm not allergic to the dope though bc I've shot it before in other veins without an adverse reaction. 

So, any ideas on what happened would be interesting to hear.

TL;DR Did shot, felt like my arm was on fire, hand swelled to giant proportions.

9frvin,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9frvin/seems_i_got_out_at_just_the_right_time/,24,https://redd.it/9frvin,CaptainMBox,Seems I got out at just the right time....,"It’s been some time my friends ! Many of you may remember me, new users, hello 👋🏻

It’s creeping up on the 6 month mark since I quit a very heavy pharma habit. (90mg-300mg Oxy IR per day switched over to a 200mg-400mg per day Morphine habit due to availability and pricing). It feels great to not wake up sick.. and not think about pills every fucking waking moment... this is kind’ve a shit post / update, but really I just wanted to check in and provide some reflections. 

The following are the 3 main reasons why I feel I hopped the opiate train at the perfect time: 

1.) I had switched from Oxy to Morphine due to price and availability of Oxy in my area. 2 months into my quit, my Morphine plug (a 60+ year old cancer patient) passed away. This guy had unlimited morphine at literal unbeaten prices, was always, always home. So that tragedy occurring, undoubtedly was a big factor in preventing my relapse. RIP Unc <3 

2.) The main plug for Oxy in my small town (has been main guy around here for 10 years and running) just got his house raided Sunday, and booked Monday for possessing 2 handguns (1 coming up stolen) with a felony, as well as several other charges. So he’ll be gone for a good while. 

3.) When I was using heavy, I maybe encountered 30 fent presses maybe 2 times in my years of use. Now, everyone I talk to, it seems to be the ONLY blues that are flooding the streets. I’m not saying real blues aren’t obtainable, but I know (at least my area) the presses are more common than real deal blues 10 times to 1. FENTANYL EVERYWHERE. 

At this point, even if I wanted to relapse, I literally have no idea where I’d even look. Besides dark web, which I’m too old school for. Or cold copping shitty fenty dope in the inner city, which I’ve never done dope, and never will. Watched 5 really good friends die, and many others in and out of jail/rehab. So just not my thing. I make great money and could always support my pharma habit. 

 So yeah, I’m glad I’m out, I’m glad I have released the demon. It’s nice looking through the window from the other side. I have a lot of love and respect for (mostly) everyone  and I wish everyone nothing but the utmost success in whatever goals are currently in their sights. Much love, opiate family.

In your opinion, do Benzodiazepines combined with opiates add to or subtract from the opiate high?

Do I take 80mg Oxycodone and chill or do I take 60mg Oxycodone and throw in say 10mg Diazepam?

Zero tolerance for the opiates, but I have a pretty damn decent tolerance to benzos. I don't use very often, but whenever I do 4-6mg at once is the sweet spot and I usually end up doing 8-9mg before the day is out with little consequence. Memory is always a bit foggy but never full blackout unless I end up doing more than 15 or so mg. How bad of an idea is this? After I get a feel for the oxymorphone I was thinking of adding 2mg of alpraz to the mix.


Edit: Yeah this shit is overblown as hell. Ended up doing like ~20mg of Opana today, like 6mg xan, and about 1500 soma. I have a lot of experience with benzos so take it as you will, but honestly just feel it out and if you aint too fuckt after the first dose hits add on what you will. Just give each new dose time to kick in so you can feel it out.

Edit2: Soma is fne but for gods sake take it easy on the xan, for the tolerance described in my post i would recommend no mpre than 2mg. There wasn't much respiratory depressiom but i did emd up blacking out",1536905394.0

I hesitate to call this hustle a success and if you read this wall of text you'll see why. When I need extra cash I look for odd jobs on Craigslist. My favorite are those that say pay is negotiable. It turns out I'm a stellar salesman and I can get good money for an easy job most of the time. Last week an ad for cleaning with a negotiable pay caught my eye and I met with an old women who needed a whole house cleaned. She said she'd pay me per hour for as long as it took.

Easy money right?

She told me her kid lived in the house and made a big mess. The price is negotiable because her kid was a ""drug user"" and she was positive there were drugs or needles inside. She wanted to be upfront about the safety risk so she was willing to pay more. My junkie brain was thinking what a score not only will I get paid hella cash for cleaning a house but I might find dope.

We agreed on $50 an hour and I started.

I'm not judging anyone for being messy especially when they're strung out. Who can be fucked to clean for free right? I understand, I really do. But fuck man, this was something else. Let me paint a vague picture for you. You guys know wd shits right? Well the toilets in this house had years worth of ass sludge crusted in and around them. I think the porcelain was starting to erode from the constant stream of acidic shits hitting the surface. The fridge was left cracked and the whole inside was molded: green mold, grey mold, foamy mold, I've seen it all. I think if it was left any longer mushrooms would start growing there. The cabinets were brimming with mouse shit, every corner of every room had cobwebs, I needed a face mask to dust. I thought cleaning a house would take me 4 hours but it took me 8. JJ didn't bless me with a stray bag either so by hour 6 I was starting to feel WDs myself. At one point I just finished cleaning the floor and then lost my lunch after smelling the fridge and had to start again. I felt like I was a contestant on a fucked up reality show:

""Junkies Cleaning up After Other Junkies"" idfk

At the end of the day I said sorry to the woman for taking longer than I first guessed but she didn't care. She thought I underestimated the mess to begin with. Then the woman starts crying. She tells me I'm an angel because she couldn't go into the house after her son died in it and didn't know what to do. I start crying too because it hit too close to home. She took that as an invitation to keep talking. My next two hours were spent listening to the woman that reminds me too much of my own mom crying her eyes out about her kid who od'ed.

and I was crying with her.

The successful part is that she paid me for the 8 hours cleaning and the 2 hours talking at $50 an hour. I made $500 for a days work which was a score but fuck me if I ever have to do that again. ",1536903553.0

at the moment I am some sort of chipper amd this time it really works. I ruined my piss test today but otherwise I know what I can tell my Psychologist why I took what I took. The next one is in about 1 or 2 month so I can consume now again.Yay. So atm I rail some lines ams then Inthrow in 20mg of Etizolam. IDK hoe strong it is compared to Diazepam for example. I cant find amything on google too. Its like google deleted everything about drugs. And bing dont work at my phone. IDK why. So maybe you can help me. Its for.relaxing and sleeping. I mean yeah I am really high but IDK if its just from the fire dope or from the fire dope.mixed with etiz. I started to enjoy benzos now. Since I cant use dope.daily anymore. Sadly and good cause otherwise I will be dead im some years and thats not what I want for.me or my family. I lost my dad 2. years ago and I know how hard that was. And I dont want that my mom and bro have to go through that shit again. So which benzos do you take? Also which do you mix with dope? I really like Alprazolam, Diazepam, Clonazepam, Etizolam, oh and I would love to test some rohypnol (flunitrazepam) but thats hard to find. I can get blistered benzos very cheap ans I know that not the right sub for this but r/Benzodiazepins is a joke... so maybe some of you could help me out. I am thankfull for every tip i dont care if its a tip for mixing dope and benzos or sedating benzos oh yeah I mostly enjoy the sedating benzos..Amd I dont take like 10 and black out the maximum are 2 or 3 over the day and max for one week and then I wait a few days so I wont get addicted to them they ahould just help me through my shitty job so I can go there the last few month untill I can get out of there and find a new one. Oh amd the etiz start kicking in now cause Instart nodding from about 100mg of dope nasal plus 20mg of Etiz. So yeah thanks im advance guys. And I will see a psychatrist in the next month who will hopefully give me a script for benzos too against my anxiety ans panic attacks. So thanks in advance fam. Stay safe and please dont write that mixing opis and benzos is risky. I always know that but I will do it. You cant change that. I cant change your habbits too. So love you fam. Stay safe and rememver to have narcan or call 911 for help. Every life matters. I lost 1 friend 2 weeks ago to an OD cause the assholes who were with him just threw him out of the house on the street and then called 911 and it was already to late. They were concerned cause they had paraphenelia. No drugs in the apartment. Such bastards. But karama will catch these assholes too. You can always do more not less so do a test bump/shot before you do your normal dose. I forgot that a week ago too and then I started nodding hard at work and my coworker came over to look for me and I stood up and collapsed and fell dowm and was out forinute or two she carred about me and I told her that it must be my meds and that I am ok. So since then everytime I got new stuff I do a teat bump and if I mix benzos and dope I just do half my dope dose because of the benzos. So enough from my high talking machine. Stay safe. And give me some tips for good benzos and please no RC benzos. Thanks im advance again fam. ",1536869759.0

I started on 4mg a day, then I realized once a day wasn't enough cause I was miserable by my best l next dose. So I took 4 then 2. Then 2 and 2. Then 4 in the morning. Then 3. Then 2. Yesterday at 3am I took my last bit (it was like 2.5-3.5. My friend was sick and had to fly so I cut her off some). My original taper plan involved one more strip, 2 in the morning then 1 in the morning, but the plug isn't picking up. Right now it's been almost 36 hours and I really don't feel that bad. Around 3 am today (bout 24 hours for those keeping track lol) I started to feel sick and I was bracing for a very tough, very long day, but right now I really don't feel too bad. The other day I left my subs at home and slept somewhere else, I woke up 24 hours after last dose and I felt pretty much how I do now, maybe it was a little worse then (this was already a massive improvement over the start of the detox. Day 1 I waited 26 hours and I was fucking dying). My question is if this is my tolerance getting lowered a lot, or just the subs taking longer to wear off? I didn't expect a taper to do much after less than 2 weeks, if this I lower tolerance I might just tell the plug to stick the sub up his ass for telling me ""I got you"" when I asked last night, then ghosting me all night and today.",1536866208.0
9fkf8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9fkf8p/codeine_bloatingstomach_issues/,5,https://redd.it/9fkf8p,tilet,Codeine + bloating/stomach issues,"Hi all :)

I’ve been addicted to codeine kinda full-on for 2 years now. At one point I was on around 400-500mg doses (in one go, every night) but now I cap it to 300mg. Long story short, 2 months ago I developed GERD (basically like acid reflux but worse I think) and I take Zantac/ranitidine and things like ginger tea to help when it hurts after taking my dose.

Recently I’ve been getting a horrible feeling of bloating and dizziness, but not every single time I take my dose. It got so bad the other night I thought I was going to pass out from the dizziness and I was certain I was going into anaphylactic shock because I didn’t take my normal promethazine pill to counteract the itching (instead certrizine this time).

Does anyone have experience with similar side-effects? I understand things like this might be localised to codeine and not other opiates/opioids. The GERD IS probably due to the fact I ALWAYS took it on an empty stomach to maximise effects until I started getting these symptoms. 

Thanks guys, stay safe :)

Earlier this year I came home from my grandmothers funeral, still in my suit to find my wife of 10 years deceased on the couch from an apparent overdose on Pain Medication.   


Addiction has ran in her family forever, through out entire marriage it has been an on-going battle for her to try to control. She has had multiple accidental overdoses through the years and we were lucky that I was always there to save her and get her help, however, this time I wasn't.   


We shared a 10 year old son together, this was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, was to tell our son that his mother was gone forever. Addiction tears individuals apart and tears families apart, it is something that is very serious.   


I am actually a Film Maker, so after her death I decided to partner with a musician who wrote a song about addiction and create a powerful music video to help raise awareness for addiction. I would like to share that video with you here now and ask that if this video has an impact on you, rather big or small that you share it and hopefully it helps you or someone you know get help.

This question would be better in r/drugs or stims or benzos. But I'm on this sub every day, so I feel more comfortable asking here.

I took a tiny amount of coke tonight (rubbed a little on my gum & took a bump), not sure exactly what time I stopped but I know it was by 11pm (mtn time, not that that matters). For the first time since I started taking stims & benzos like 5 years ago, I forgot I'd just taken stims & took 1/4 of a 1 mg xanax around 12:45 am. Took another 1/4 about 30 seconds before I remembered I took stims that night.

I started purging right away & it looks like I got that second 1/4 out. But I'm not positive, & since I haven't ever made this mistake before I'm a little scared & not sure what to do. For reference I take about 2 mg xanax nightly (I know it's a bad idea to take these every day ftr. I'm slowly working on tapering). I'm 26 & dont think I have any serious heart conditions.

How much danger am I in guys? It wasn't a ton of either drug, so I can't tell whether I should keep purging until my stomach's empty or just ride this out or what..I know this is either a ridiculously dumb post or I made a very stupid mistake, but it is what it is.

Some of the things they tell you to do is to not use any synthetic opiates. I thought this was weird because they do not mention Natural Opiates.

Less toxic than say.. Hydrocodone?

Many opiates are naturally occuring in Opium, but they're all ""bound together"" in one plant. so its still in its natural state when consumed.

Ok so IF I understand all this correctly which is a big if, normal opiate agonists bind to the mu receptor agonize it and then detach and float around in your body and then reattach to another one with varying affinity(strength of attachment).

&#x200B;

<Please note I'm using terms sloppily and paraphrasing, feel free to correct me this is interesting!>

&#x200B;

These two drugs above however will attach to your mu receptors PERMANENTLY, they are never detaching. Sounds awesome right? Well not really since apparently mu receptors can only take so much agonizing until they internalize(get sucked back in and go into hibernation) taking them out of commission.

&#x200B;

So if what I am reading is correct these drugs should provide a powerful high for around 48 hours(narcan wouldn't work BTW!) at which point the mu receptors they are bound to would internalize, possibly leaving you with a near naive low tolerance? Maybe? I'm not sure if human beings, or addicts have ever consumed these, or if its all tests on guinea pig intestinal cells.

The first stone I ever got from him was so fuckin fat that ever since I've been trying to acclimatise myself to the generally normal size of the white round my ways, convinced absolutely every time that the runner's pinched some of the rock or that the dude's simply getting stingy.

As it happens the appearance of the crack grime coating the cooker sides seduced me and I found myself meticulously rubbing away at that tantalising grey film with a wet filter, the disappearance of which was the precursor to me dumping in the remainder of the gear I was trying to save for later. A sprinkle of vitamin C powder which had an accident a few weeks ago, leaving it clumpy, dotted throughout with shrapnel like Big Boss after the coma, and somewhere during or between those steps I squirted two randomly-filled-rigs-worth of tap water into the mix, because without water, nothing can occur. That's true for everything in existence. Well, nearly.  
So yeah, strictly speaking I did have another snowball. With so little girl- and thus far I've purposely avoided using these specific American slang words for the drugs simply because I didn't really like them- and a rather large amount of boy, I wondered how much of this snowball I would actually feel.

Shit you’ve had to do to get money/drugs, police encounters, being ripped off, dealing with asshole dealers..whatever. I’ve come to realize other addicts almost always have at least a few good stories haha. 

I’ll start it off with 2-

Me and a friend were both broke so we found some wire to scrap. Took it to the scrapyard and ended up being like $13 short for what we needed so decided to go to Walmart and steal a few of those big heavy gauge extension cords. We get to Walmart, grab a cart and go to the aisle. We weren’t sure exactly how many we needed and didn’t want to end up coming up short again so we figure better to be safe than sorry.  So we choose the longest heavy duty extension cords they had, they were like 100ft and costed $50/$60 each. 
We grab 8 of them, throw them in the cart and come to the conclusion that rather than just push the cart straight out like we already paid, it’d be less sketchy if we put our coats on top of them, he gets in the cart, and I push him out of the store. Well let’s just say our coats didn’t hide them at all and looking back at the situation, that was probably the MOST sketchy way possible haha. 
So anyway, we start heading towards the exit, no greeter/receipt checker so we think we’re good. We get through the first set of doors, about to walk through the second set when I’m pretty sure I hear “Walmart loss prevention” behind me in the quietest voice. I turn around and see this guy who I recognize from the aisle we got the cords from. He was there twice talking on his cell phone but not really looking at anything specific. Once I see him I already know I heard correctly and just keep walking. He says “Excuse me, Walmart loss prevention, please stop” and I of course ignore him. I had parked by the auto section where they do oil changes, so when we got outside I turned and start going down the sidewalk right in front of the store. Loss prevention is still following us but he’s staying back a bit for some reason.. I say “you ready?” to my friend (who’s still in the cart), he just gives me a look which I assumed meant he WAS in fact ready, so I stop short, putting the front of the cart against the garden section fence so it didn’t move as much when he jumped out and I start running, thinking he’s right behind me. Well he wasn’t, I get to the car and hear “wait, wait, don’t leave” and see him still halfway between me and the cart. I start the car, open his door, and put the car in drive ready to takeoff once he gets in. We get away safely, no extension cords but at least we didn’t get arrested. LP stopped following us once we left the cart, I assume their main concern was getting their product back. We figured out another way to get money and after we copped and got high I asked him why it took so long to get to the car.. he says “I had to get our coats” Lmao like bruh, we have loss prevention following us and your first thought after hopping out the cart was to get our coats? Too funny.

This one is quick, just though it was kinda funny-
One time I met my dealer in a Home Depot parking lot. I was sick af and sat there for over an hour waiting. He finally shows up, I get my shit, and go into Home Depot straight to the bathroom. There’s 3 stalls, 2 of which also had someone in them so I decide to wait to get my shot ready. I’m sitting there impatiently for a few minutes when I hear an unmistakable sound, the flicking/opening of stamp bags. I say “it sounds like we all had the same idea” and hear the other 2 people start laughing. I know they’re doing the same thing so I get my shot ready, do it and get out if there.

EDIT: I've added a TL;DR at the end of the post.

I've been clean of heroin and cocaine for approx two years. I was on methadone initially but really despise the stuff so changed to buprenorthine (we call it subutex of subbies) sometime in 2016..

So i was really keen to detox off the subbies before i start university in (oh my bloody fucking helllll) 5 bloody days. 5 days!! I'm kinda realising as i tyope how bloody soon that is! So i detoxed mid August and have been truly clean for 30 days (I say 'truly' clean as I'm aware that some people consider being on subutex or methadone as not true abstinence; interesting idea to debate as I'm on Quetiapine and Mirtazipine \[sp?\] probably forever. I'd be curious to know who would consider that to negate my abstinence).

Okay, so Iwent to a festival with a mate who likes to drink. I was undecided about about whether or not I'd drink - I was never an alcoholic really, but sadly, I can't be a casual drinker - I can't stop after a few and usually I just end up making a tit of myself. Or worse, I'll start fiending and will do absolutely anything to score (heroin, crack, ketamine or diazepam). My friend was drinking whisky, which is my choice of drink and probably the 'safest' drink for me - as I have in the past been able to have a hot toddy at a family xmas do, or a glass of Glenmorangie with ice and then just call it a day.

I realised that I'm really waffling. To cut a long story short, I scored crack and smack. This was Wednesday afternoon. I had a few pipes and sniffed a little of the gear. Thne I thought, if im going to do this, I'm going to do this properly (I don;t want any excuse tomorrow to score again). Took a taxi to a local pharmacy and bought some pins - online it said that there's a needle exchange in the pharmacy, turns out no, but I was able to buy a couple of pins (20p a pop! Who'da thought it?!)

So I've sorted myself a speedball and I'd really appreciate it if someone would run through some basic harm reduction with me.

To be really clear, i've not used heroin or crack cocaine (or anything) since April 2016. I'm not sober currently, I've smoked a little gear and a few pipes but obviously my tolerance is super low. I have a bunch of buprenorphine left over, is it at all possible that to use that in case of an overdose? I've heard it has naltrexone in it?Of course that would be a total last resort and probably sounds really stupid, but I'd rather deal with instant withdrawal than to OD..

EDIT: Is it possible to purchase naltrexone from a chemist? Headshop?

EDIT: TL;DR:  
I've relapsed but don't want to die tonight. Seeking any harm reduction knowledge or info regarding naloxone in the UK.

EDIT: I've heard of a few overdoses occurring in the UK due to another more potent opiate being in the gear. I can't remember the name of the stuff but there was a Louis Theroux documentary about it in the US somewhere. There's also been a few mentions of it on BBC Radio 4 and I've seen several posters warning of the increased likelihood of overdosing if your skag is laced with this stuff. I'm based in North West England, should I be concerned about this stuff? Also, as I've been clean 2+ years so I don't have a regular guy who I can trust not to give me dodgy gear...",1536801073.0

That out of the way, My connect is a woman that gets fat scripts every month. For years the process goes as follows -

\-1: She gets her script

\-2: I middle for her on a single big deal that moves 2/3 of her product and nets her about $500 and nets me about $300 which I use to pay the power bill.

\-3: As the weeks progress, I get the odd front here and there and I end up owing her about 60-90 bucks when the scripts  run out.

\-4: The following month, she re-ups, we do the single 2/3 deal as per usual and I pay her what I owe her out of my $300.

&#x200B;

This has been the routine since time out of mind. Well this time, she sold her main nut to someone else (historically I've been her only buyer because I'm safe, simple and have only a couple of clients I sell to) and then lied about it saying that the pharmacy was out and had to order the script leaving me calling her \*every\* day asking about whether it's come in yet. Also, me telling MY clients that I'm waiting on the pharmacy when in fact, she had it the whole goddamn time.

&#x200B;

Instead of making this a ludicrously long post the TL;DR is:
