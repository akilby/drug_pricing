‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôm a chronic pain patient (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, and a host of back issues... so it‚Äôs mainly just my joints, bones, and muscles, everywhere in my entire body).  

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

***BACKGROUND:*** My doctor put me on 50mcg Fentanyl patches (I‚Äôd been getting the brand name, Duragesic, because they stick best through showering, sweat, and movement and they seem to have the most steady delivery vs. some of the generics).  I also take six 10mg Hydrocodone pills throughout the day for breakthrough pain.  I was recently put on Medicare through my disability, and my plan (Humana), paid for the first month of Duragesic patches and then sent a letter saying they wouldn‚Äôt do it again, and I was expecting that they just needed a prior auth to demonstrate that I‚Äôd been on the patches for years now and that I‚Äôd taken all the prerequisite medications to justify them but I guess that‚Äôs not happening.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

***The proposed alternatives for the Duragesic patches are:***  

- Morphine ER Tab
- [Xtampza](https://www.empr.com/xtampza-er/drug/34583/) (generic: Oxycodone)
- [Embeda](https://www.empr.com/embeda/drug/34446/) (generic: Morphine sulfate + naltrexone HCl)

I‚Äôve never heard of Xtampza or Embeda before and that makes me nervous.  It took... a long time to finally find the right combination of medications and I‚Äôm still in pain ‚Äî I‚Äôm never *not* in pain, but the patches help to work 24 hours a day and I take two 10mg Hydrocodone in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I would greatly appreciate any personal advice or recommendations so I can discuss what seems like the best alternative medication with my doctor.  If anyone happens to know the appropriate equivalent dosage for a 50mcg fentanyl patch in an extended release medication, that would also be helpful.  I‚Äôm not sure if maybe a better route is finding a more powerful medication that works all day and night so I don‚Äôt take the Hydrocodone for breakthrough pain as well.  So again, I‚Äôm grateful for any help or advice, and I apologize in advance if this isn‚Äôt the right place for this.",1544579002.0

I think a vendor accidentally sent Alprazolam powder instead of #4.,"I'm fairly versed in opiates and the markets. One of my buddies wanted some market #4 just to try because I was bragging about the quality to him compared to street shit. He gave me the money for a gram and a little extra for my own pocket. I use the markets regularly so I was competent in selecting a vendor. 

I picked a fairly new vendor with 2 products; Alp powder and #4, that's it. He has great reviews so I thought nothing of it. Sent the package to my friends address and when he got it, he notified me. Then, everything went to shit. 

He did a test bump of a HALF point and called me an hour later slurring his words and saying he felt like a benzo high and didn't really feel like Heroin. He'd also forget things he said just minutes ago. He'd go from ""bro I think I need more of this"" to ""Wtf did you give me man, this isn't heroin"" to dropping his phone and shit. He sounds barred out, to be fair.

The issue I have is that he described the powder as tan and a slight vinegar smell, that DOESN'T sound like Alp. I haven't talked to him for about 20\~ minutes but I'm about to leave and go pick him up.

Is there any Fentanyl analogue that would give these symptoms? Could it be an overdose? I've never heard of OD symptoms where you'd be up talking and walking but maybe? Other reviews say a half point shot got them pretty high but not OD. Gonna read comments once I have him.",1544576239.0

What better than anonymously on a forum full of people who will understand.

This is gonna be a long one, so if you wanna get to the part where I talk about the spiritual experience I had of shitting, just scroll down until you see **TL;DR**. For the shortest version of this post possible just read the **SHIT-TIME** section.

-----------**BACKGROUND**---------------

So I'm not a stranger to constipation, but it's never been this bad. The last time I had constipation that comes even close to what I had last night was about 2-3 years ago. I was drinking [opium tea] daily (back when it was actually strong) and after a month of this I had barely shit. I used magnesium citrate and a hot bath and was able to get it out, and bled for the first time from shitting (which made me want to puke). 

(Edit: I forgot to mention that during the ""opium tea"" constipation I had, I also caught a fuckin stomach bug. It was my 3rd day visiting family and I made some eggs. Turns out the eggs were 3 weeks past their good by date, and my family had just never been damned to throw them away, so I ate them and got sick. I'd wake with a super strong urge to shit and end up pissing out of my ass - I'd straight up shit clear water every day, while the actual shit was stuck and I was constipated. Pretty awful.)

Flash forward now and I haven't had much problems with constipation because I have been using kratom exclusively for the last 5 months. The main problem now was I was noticing blood in my stool more than half the time I would shit. No real constipation though. At this point I'd gotten used to the blood and would clean myself in the shower if I ever saw it. It still makes me sick but idk what to do.

Anyways, here's where the real story starts: for the last month and a half I've been using suboxone every day, I replaced kratom with subs. Usually 2-4mg a day.

I didn't really realize it, but as the weeks went by I didn't shit. And I was eating a normal amount + days with big meals.

By the 4th week I'd realized I hadn't taken a real shit in a while, just pebbles like 4 times in the last 4 weeks. I also noticed I would sometimes need to push a little bit to pee.

Then I tried to poop, and it wouldn't come out. It was stuck.

So I started drinking magnesium citrate and was able to get a small, dense one out.

A couple days pass and I try again. This time it hurts and is completely stuck. I start to worry and realize how fucked I am. That was 8 days ago, and I realized then that there would be eventual retribution, that I had to pay the price.

As well, 8 days ago I ran out of subs and used kratom the entire week. Yesterday I got more subs and have been using them since. The week of just kratom got my bowels moving more.

So that day I started the kratom I bought solid and liquid glycerin suppositorys, more magnesium citrate, and miralax. That night I put in the solid glycerin one and kept it in for two days before I had to go. When I tried to poop, it was a solid conglomerate of smaller dense pebbled. It wasn't shaped right to come out so I shot some of the liquid glycerin to help get it out. It burned like a bitch. After 10 minuted I peed glycerin out if my ass, and then was able to shit. The glycerin had broken the conglomerate into chunks. That was about 6 days ago.

If you'd total all of my shit since starting bup, it would have been worth 2-4 nornal shits, except possibly much denser.

-------------**TL;DR**---------------------

So yesterday I wake up in WD with the strong urge to shit, but I had to go get my subs so I put the shitting off. I got and dosed half a strip of subs and just held in the shit cus I could tell it was gonna be painful.

Later that day, when the urge got too strong, I tried to shit. It would just barely come out and got stuck, which was extremely painful. I realized this wasn't gonna come out without tearing my ass, unless I did something. It was just so dense, hard, and dry. As well, what I didn't realize was that this shit was mishapen. It was a conglomerate of mid sized pebbles that was shaped extremely weird, it had a cavitation in the middle, like a cup, that was pointing out of my ass, and it had sides that were too long 

So I made the really hard choice and *sucked it back into my asshole*. I aborted mission. It hurt so bad doing that but I was honestly too scared to continue trying, and wasn't eager to test whether my asshole or the shit was stronger. I also noticed my stomach looked distended, fat, even though I'm extremely skinny and have almost no body fat.

I made a plan: I'd give myself a liquid glycerin suppository + the same amount of water up my ass, and retain it/hold it in there until tomorrow, to give it time to soften the shit up and hopefully it'd break apart. 

So later that night at 11, after eating an entire small thin crust papa johns pizza, I decided I'd do it now.

I covered the tip of the liquid suppository syringe with petroleum jelly/vaseline, and shot glycerin up there. Then I refilled it with water and shot water uo there. Then another bulb full of water. Then I washed my hands and laid down in bed, I didn't really get an urges to shit.

Until 3 hours later, when I got an extremely strong urge to go. I raced to the bathroom and shit out pure liquid shit. So dark I couldn't see through it but pure liquid. No solids. I could tell I didn't get anything substantial out. I could tell because the same solid shit as before was trying to get out but like before it couldn't get out, and hurt so bad. I sucked it back in after all the liquid was evacuated.

So I drank a spoonfull of miralax + like 3 doses of magnesium citrate and a lot of water. Then an idea: maybe I could also use one of the solid suppositorys overnight. See, at this point I was terrified of what was gonna happen. Opiates make me scared of shitting because of how painful it can be.

So I applied more vaseline to my butthole and shoved a solid glycerin suppository in there until it was deep in. It kinda hurt. Not because of the burn or anything, I didn't feel that. But because at the end of the suppository, facing out of my ass, was a cup. 

It's hard to describe over writing but it basically has a shelf at the bottom, like a cup. The edges extend but it's hollow. And the edges felt sharp and was rubbing against my colon. I tried getting it out but the vaseline formed a vacuum and the more I tried to get it out the more the edges of the end rubbed and hurt my rectum.

A good analogy would be that it felt like a lego brick was stuck in my asshole.

Then I wondered whether these things actually dissolve. I put a new solid suppository in my sink and ran hot water over it for a while. Nothing happened, it looked exactly the same. Btw, it was the exact same the next morning. What the fuck is even the point of these things if they don't dissolve.

So now I basically had a solid buttplug in that wasn't gonna dissolve. And it hurt, any movement I made it hurt.

So I just tried to pretend nothing was wrong and go to sleep. I took some melatonin and layed down and tried to ignore the fact that any time I made the slightest movement my asshole would hurt. 

After about an hour or two of this, I had the urge to piss (from all the water I drank for the magnesium and miralax). And I had to shit. Urgently.

-------------**SHIT-TIME**----------------

So I stumbled to the bathroom, walking funny to avoid my ass hurting from the glycerin butt plug, and tried to piss. But nothing was coming out. And when I tried to push, I could feel shit being pushed out. Not wanting to diarrhea all over my pants and underwear, I sat on the toilet. But it wasn't enough... So I took off my pants/underwear and squated on the ground. Here's where it gets fun.

I still wasn't able to pee, but immediately a bunch more liquid comes out of my ass and all over the bathroom floor. Same stuff as before, dark liquid shit. I said fuck it and took off my shirt and reached my hand to my ass. I had pushed enough and was able to easily retrieve the solid suppository, which was still completely solid and the exact same as before. I threw it away in the toilet. 

I decided that since I'd already got the suppository out I might as well try to manipulate the shit in me and maybe try to get it to come out. I felt around the shit and realized that it was almost hooking over my ass from the inside. Some of it was out, some of it was inside but too far sideways thus my ass couldn't handle the width, and because of how dense it was it wasn't breaking. I started manually pushing and breaking. And what's funny was that I wasn't actually even able to break it, that's how strong it was, I couldn't break it with my hands. I pushed it in, pulled, pushed my taint, etc, just messing around with it. And the entire time this was happening I was in massive pain. 

I then decided to quit and stood up. And then I felt a shift. I jumped in the shower and started pushing and it rapidly started coming out more then it had before. It got stuck again so I grabbed it, this time it was actually starting to come out. This entire time I was repeating the word fuck and god no and was in massive pain. When it got stuck again I actually tried to suck it back in because of how much pain I was in but it was already too far out, which I realized when I touched it. I pulled it with my hand and clenched my ass to hopefully break it between my glorius sphincter, and I started feeling the familiar feeling of your ass releasing and closing around shit as it lets go. Suddenly it was free, and suddenly I was holding a piece of shit like a goddamn monkey. The release felt amazing. And don't forget, the entire time I was standing up.

I held it. It was a monster, a ball the size of a small orange and the density of a neutron star. I sighed in relief...

**But wait, there's more!**

I suddenly realized I had more. I dropped the shit in my hand on the shower tiles. At first I thought all of the pain and  urgency I'd been experiencing all day was from the shit I had just shit, and I fully expected the next load to just be small comfortable pieces that had simply been blocked. Because of this mistaken belief, I pushed hard. Within 15 seconds it was already getting pretty far out of my ass and I realized the mistake I had made. This was the true monster. The uncomfortableness and pain of it merged in my mind and honestly it hurt so bad I became dissociated, which almost numbed the pain. The second this happened I just started repeating ""Oh my god, it's so big, please no, I can't believe this is happening, how is this even possible it's too big"" over and over again. Once it was out halfway I felt it and pulled a little bit and this finished it off. The feeling of my asshole and rectum slipping over the end of it and retracting was both extremely uncomfortable, painful, and almost welcoming because it meant I wasn't prolapsing and that it was over. That last second as my ass finally retracted on itself and fully expelled the shit was glorious. The last half of it exiting felt like a crescendo, almost spiritual, 100% an altered state, the last 20 seconds of it exiting had this energy that built up until it exploded right at the end. Like the opposite of an orgasm and extremely painful and completely non-sexual. In retrospect it came out in a very healthy way, it's like after the initial blockage was released my body was super eager to get the stuff behind it out and orchestrated the effort perfectly.

It exited my ass and fell right into my hand, and as it did I could already tell it was heavy. I moved my hand to my front and examined the shit in disbelief. It was, by far and without a doubt, the widest shit I have ever shit. I honestly couldn't believe it. It was fucking huge. It was about a fist and a half wide and 8 inchs long. This will sound absolutely ridiculous, but I almost felt proud, and I definitely felt relieved, standing there in the shower naked, holding shit. 

I dropped the monster on the tiles and stood there in disbelief for a minute or two, basking in the feeling of absolute relief. My asshole felt honestly kinda good because it was finally completely relaxed, the entire day it had been puckering constantly in order to hold all the shit in but now it could just be free. I checked my stomach in the mirror and it looked completely normal. I then realized I still had to pee and tried to and peed normally there in the shower which was amazing because the pressure that had been blocking my urinary tract was now gone.

After another minute or two of disbelief and joy I began cleaning up. Threw the shit in the toilet (which it immediately clogged), cleaned the floor, and then turned on the shower and took a very long, cleansing shower. Washed the shower tiles, washed my body completely, washed my ahole out. After I got out of the shower I took a big glob of petroleum jelly and rubbed the outside and a little bit of the inside of my butthole with it. Surprisingly I didn't see any blood during this whole ordeal whatsoever which is funny considering how big it was compared to nornal ones, but I still applied vaseline just incase.

After spraying bleach cleaner fucking everywhere in the bathroom and getting dressed with new clothes I fell into bed in utter spiritual relief and browsed on my phone before falling asleep.

If I had known how everything would turn out, and if I had known how it would have felt, I probably would've tried to have avoided it all costs and just hold it in. But now that it's over and I got that shit out, I feel so much better, and am glad it happened. I think constipation where you have lots of shit built up is extremely unhealthy and I'm glad I've gotten a mini-reset. Even though I took a ton of miralax and magnesium citrate yesterday I haven't had any urge whatsoever to shit today, not even a tiny one, and no gas. I know that I'll be taking magnesium citrate and miralax every day from now on to make sure a blockage like that never developes again. I've learned my lesson.

What I think happened was the multiple doses of magnesium citrate and miralax I had been taking ended up rehydrating and fusing multiple logs of shit into one, like a shit mutant hybrid. The initial blockage had been preventing these logs their exit and when I soaked them with laxatives they all fused into one.

Anyways, I hope you guys found that enjoyable/entertaining or relatable. I might delete this because of how disgusting it is but I'm interested in hearing some responses or others people's stories. Cheers.",1544571199.0

&#x200B;

I feel I need to start with a bit of a back story, so here it goes. I first used codeine around 5 years ago by using the CWE method with a friend. I really enjoyed it and always wanted to try it again. Around 8 months ago, I found a reliable source for pure (no APAP) pharmaceutical codeine tablets 30mg. I took around 5 of these tablets every Saturday as a treat and quickly remembered how amazing the stuff makes you feel with no tolerance! Once these had ran out I decided to try dihydrocodeine (again, no APAP) just pure 30mg tablets. Dihydrocodeine is said to be around 1.5x stronger than codeine, but I feel the strength of the high is the same, just different. Dihydrocodeine feels a lot more ""speedy"" and seems to last a lot longer (up to 8 hours) in my opinion.

Before long I was using the dihydrocodeine at work on quiet days, but to my amazement I actually worked a lot better on it! Boring tasks suddenly felt fun, I was no longer getting fatigued or craving junk food, all my anxieties of talking to customers had suddenly disappeared. I simply felt amazing!

I continued to use every other day, until one weekend I went to stay at a friends house, leaving my dihydrocodeine at home. The second day I woke up with awful diarrhea and felt terribly anxiety, I assumed I had eaten something bad the day before and had a touch of food poisoning. The next day came and I felt worse, I had everything from the second day but with added chills and incredible aches in my muscles, at that point it dawned on me, I was in withdrawal. I got home that night and started researching about it, how long it would last ect. and decided to stick it out, for the next few days the diarrhea subsided but the chills/aches continued, but I powered on using non-opiate pain killers and small amounts of phenibut and alcohol in the evenings to help me through it.

Around 7 days from the start, I finally felt normal again.

About a month ago I decided to start using again a few days a week, and of course, I've slipped back into daily use. I am going through a stressful and unique period in my life, I am busy at work as well as studying for a qualification that wont finish until the middle of next year and the dihydrocodeine helps me so much! SO my question is...can I keep using dihydrocodeine to help me through this period? I am currently using about 120-180mg per day and my tolerance doesn't seem to have increased that much. I have two very reliable sources so its unlikely I will run out it suddenly, and even if I did I always make sure to have a least 30 tablets in reserve just in case I need them to taper off.  I also have no way of getting stronger opiates even if I wanted to, so I'm not going to jump up a level.

What do you all think? Can I carry on using for now and taper off in a couple of months? Or am I harming myself in some way and should quit as soon as possible?

Thanks for reading all that and for any replies!

&#x200B;

\*EDIT\*

I suppose what I'm asking is if I continue using will I be able to quit with similar ease as last time or am I missing something? Also am I causing any damage to myself?

This equals about $1000/week and $52000(!)/year, which is absolutely insane to me because I‚Äôm really not even getting THAT high. 

So I always hear about how everyone switches from pills to dope because they are too expensive. My question is, at this level of use how much would you end up spending per week by switching to dope. Also secondly, how fast does your tolerance build from this point. With pills it feels like I gotta up the dose every mf day if I‚Äôm actually trying to nod out. Like I‚Äôm curious how much people end up spending when hooked on H. 

*I want to put a disclaimer saying that I have absolutely no plans of switching and even if I wanted to, I have no plugs or leads to make that happen. The reason I even ran up my tolerance like this is because I used to have an insane rx plug that I would trade with for other drugs. Now that I‚Äôm actually paying cash for shit I‚Äôm realizing how insanely expensive this habit is and I‚Äôm not (at least I hope) about to empty out my saving for these fucking things.

Try to keep an open mind and not simply write me off as ""I'm just not that guy and never will.""

Over a decade ago I was an extremely straight edge, respectful child who got decently good grades (Bs if I didnt try at all, As if I did) and lived with his grandparents. I always listened, never argued, always took their advice, etc. I was active in sports and other clubs (especially martial arts), and life was good. I was merely 14 years old.

Then came one fateful night where I had procrastinated on a project and was frantically looking for some tape. I opened some cupboards I've never bothered opening before, and what do I find? There was two bottles of 10mg percocet, both roughly 27/30 full, one vicodin 7.5mg nearly as full, and one bottle of 90x1mg xanax with 3 refills. The opioids had been prescribed well over 6 years earlier, and clearly weren't needed.

Now I had had the mindset that I'd never use drugs. Smoking seemed disgusting to me, both tobacco and cannabis. But as soon as I read on Erowid about what I had found, I knew I had to try them. Once I had popped my first opioid, which was two 7.5mg vicodins, I felt the most euphoric I ever had in my life.

Fast forward over two years. I had been using them in low doses, such as 10-15mg oxy and 15-20mg hydro, 6 months per year using every two weeks, then having 3 months of zero use, before cycling back to 3 months of using once a month on the dot. This was my cycle schedule for nearly 2-2.5 years before I ran out. I NEVER raised the dose beyond 20mg hydrocodone and 15mg oxycodone apart from less than 5 times during my first few months of use. I KNEW more would get me more euphoria, but I sternly believed in balance, and sought to achieve ~4-6/10 highs specifically to keep myself in check.

I NEVER broke the cycle once in a significant way, apart from one extra dose the first year on Christmas Day during a 3 month non use period, and one additional dose the following year on my Birthday during an overnight school field trip during a one-use-per-month month. I NEVER dosed two days in a row, and never more than one initial dose per session, so NO redosing. I even learned online (there was no Reddit then) that 30mg dxm and 200mg cimetidine/tall glass of white grapefruit juice from concentrate, taken together ~30min before my opioid dose, would moderately reduce my tolerance gain and increase peak plasma level (PPL)/high duration, respectively. 

The more I chipped responsibly, the more it fortified my self esteem on whether I could control it. I took pride in using potentiators and tolerance reducers religiously. It slowly but consistently established a superiority complex in terms of the inferiority of others relative to myself if they had fallen physically dependent.

I kept a calendar of exactly when I used what, with which potentiators, and any other drugs I mixed in. I learned how to CWE (to reduce ~90% or more of liver damage), to take 500mg NAC 30min before any opi (that contains APAP, even after CWE) another 500mg 4hr later to further block APAP damage. The CWE+NAC combo led to increased confidence in combining very dangerous combination drugs in small standardized doses.

To compensate for mental addiction issues and the (then mild) cravings, I decided to stop taking 0.5mg xanax with every opioid dose (obligatory opioid+benzo, opioid+booze, and especially all three, can kill you). Instead, I would take between 0.5/0.75/1mg xanax (from grandma's unlimited stash, which I would call in through the automated pharmacy service, as my grandma asked me to pick up her monthly pills anyways because she trusted me too much). 

I always washed the 0.5-1mg xanax down with exactly two glasses of grandma's red table wine, no more no less, and the result would be a solid, tipsy, laid back feeling of hakuna matata that was very enjoyable, though it was of course a distant second from opioids. With the same deal as opioids, I used 6 months per year (usually around May-Oct) twice a month, then 3 or more months without any xanax/booze/opi whatsoever,  followed lastly by 3 months of using only monthly.

Another year goes by, maybe two, where theres no opioids left and only xanax. Then my grandma had surgery and subsequently throws a bottle of 59x4mg brand new leftover dilaudid IR in the trash can because they ""dont work"" for her. The next day she asks me to drive me to the doc to get ""something else that works"", which ended up being either Oxy 10mg or 15mg IR, I think 60 tablets. Same as always, she used only 1-5 pills and then were left in an unorganized cupboard for months. I believe I was 17 at the time, had been accepted into my undergrad of choice, and the high was absolutely incredible with no tolerance when snorted, especially via low volume saline solution. 

Even still, I still only used twice opioids a month, rotating between 20mg oral oxy (see how tolerance always goes up?) and 4mg snorted dilaudid (aka hydromorphone, the second most euphoric opioid behind opana). At this point however, I was using opioids twice a month for 9 months out of the year, and once per month for 3.

I had thought the warnings were a joke. I went through most of my undergraduate college years never thinking much about opioids again (really), apart from one minor script of 30x50mg Tramadol I was given for a sprained ankle. 

Unfortunately, my exposure lead me to realize that many pharmaceuticals are prescribed all the time in a safe manner, so I thought why not try and use adderall, ritalin, etc. for academics? I mean it's not like I was using ""hard"" or ""dangerous"" drugs like meth, heroin, crack cocaine, arguably powder cocaine, etc. 

Vicodin was my gateway drug. Within 2-3 years of undergrad, I had grown and tried shrooms, tried DNM LSD from a good vendor, been a pseudo-alcoholic for my first 6-9 months of undergrad (then went back to casual use; I later learned I was never really an alcoholic),  tried and used semi regularly adderall, ritalin, focalin, and modafinil solely for academic use, and had sufficiently dabbled in, xanax, ativan, eventually diclazepam/etizolam/very limited clonazoLam solution for quite a while as a stimulant crash sleep aid/occasional severe anxiety controller, and to dampen perceived negative effects of stims/psychedelics/sometimes even weed.

Apart from dropping the booze and becoming a near 24/7 weed vaper (smoked for 2-3 months and then got a vape and never looked back), everything remained the same in undergrad. My grades were pretty good. I had the best and more loyal girlfriend ever. I had a tight social circle. My long term girlfriend would bring a few of her family's extra 10mg roxy IR back to school after every break, and we would take them together, again 20-25mg or less 1-2x per month. 

Life was still good, and again I thought the nay sayers were a joke.

Eventually I was an upperclassman, and was prescribed a crazy (in my opinion) amount of vicodin, something like 200x10mg vicodin total, for wisdom teeth with two compacted and later two dry sockets. I had pushed for extra meds, and I got them. While the pain was horrible, opioids barely even helped. I just stashed at least half of it away after bingeing it for the pain I felt during every breath of air.

I was maybe 22 and I was mentally hooked again, 100%, but still managed to space out my use. ""Chippers never last"" again seemed like a colossal joke. I knew they were expensive on the street and semi hard to obtain constantly. I told myself the reward of a better high would always justify waiting to use again. I thought the idea chipping can never be successful was a joke. Deep down I was convincing myself I was somehow superior, somehow knew better, that knowledge and intelligence somehow made up for a massive lack of both wisdom and experience. 

Undergrad was nearly over, and after a case of rare shingles (for my age) that didnt hurt at all, I bluffed my way into a few dozen codeine 30s and a follow up script of 30x50mg tramadol.

I had chipped for over 8 years at this point. Then my life changed forever. I had found a source for cheap opium from a hippy college friend who visited a specific 3rd world country annually. He had a direct contact in the region. I could be high all day for rather cheap, less than $10. I vaped some for fun and occasionally boofed, but mostly just ate it. It was a DN vendor that eventually offered email-only transactions (no marketplace), and shipped in bulk from a third world country.

At the time I was entering grad school, and was about to propose to the love of my love who had been by my side since i was 18-19. I moved to a new city and a new school, where I knew no one, all my classmates were over a decade older than me/had 2 kids, where I was the only student that took courses full time and didnt work a legal job, where good imported medical weed was a whopping $60/8th retail (try 3-3.2g short 8ths) , and I began being extremely depressed. It wasnt my scene. I went from dorm rooms full of people I know, frat parties where I fell into crime and made more than I'd ever make busting my ass in the cafeteria, and rarely being alone, to being alone apart from my soon to be fiance that worked 50hr/week and commuted another 10-12hr/week.

Within 3-5 months I was using morphine nearly daily. It started as weekly and rapidly became twice a week spaced out, then Saturday Sunday AND Wednesday, eventually doing it Fri/Sat/Sun, and next I knew it basically was daily because of the half life. I told myself theres no physical damage, it's cheaper than beer, and I can taper anytime. I told myself it's less physically harming than even combusting cannabis. 

All I thought about was the physical damage, never the mental.

Eventually my online access to the opium dried up or increased in price 30 fold through other vendors, and I realized I had been consuming up to 4000mg of oral morphine a day, though usually around 1000mg, and that the morphine had over double the half life of morphine tablets because of the other alkaloids in opium. I became desperate and told myself I'd do anything but heroin, because I'm not as low as ""them"", being dope users. The truth was them and myself were the same. 

Eventually I found a vendor for a very good and relativelt safe tramadol analogue (as safe as morphine), and began eating/snorting/boofing entire grams of the stuff. It was 3-4x the strength of tramadol when eaten and 6-8x when boofed. So 1g boofed equaled roughly 7000mg of tramadol tolerance (obviously that much actual tramadol would likely kill you).

Long story short, it ended up taking me 4 years to complete a grad program that should have taken me 1.5 years. I had developed an anxiety disorder and bipolar type behavior, which was heavily amplified by opioid and occasional benzo use.

I ended up in a situation where a friend 3 hours away said they had tons of dilaudid, I was nearly out of opioids, but long story short, when I showed up, the dilaudid was long gone/sold/consumed orally because my friend was an idiot and didnt know better, and all he had was heroin. I told myself it would be humiliating if I drove 6 hours for nothing. I knew if I stayed the night I would end up using, because fuck driving for hours when you're in WD and need a toilet. Yes, me, the guy who would never do heroin, did heroin. 

But guess what? With my monster tolerance, I felt 0.5/10 from an entire gram of pretty decent big city dope. I realized how fucked my tolerance was. It was tested fent-negative in front of me, and the other people around my friend had serious experience. They told me this dope was around a 6-7/10 compared to what they saw on average in a massive midwest city with large int'l import/export. 

I was ashamed, both for the fact that I had tried dope, and the fact I couldn't even get well let alone high on dope because my tolerance was beyond it. For a year I was forced to make my own morphine, 100% for personal use. My wife was beyond pissed and had no patience left. I don't blame her. Eventually I had periods of sobriety, and for the last 4-5 months I have been on suboxone.

Long story short, my life became dictated by my dependency. This last month I lost a cousin to a meth/coke OD heart attack/heart damage from cotton filtered IV use, and as a result recently relapsed for four days on flake opium.

The next week, without any clue what would happen next, I was served divorce papers, and my wife told me she wanted me out in 2 weeks. The love of my life, my soul mate no longer wanted anything to do with me. I wasnt the same person she had met nearly a decade earlier.

It was no one but me who made each and every decision of mine along the way. However, if you told 14 year old me this is what happens when you open Pandora's box, when you try two of grandma's pills, I would have never believed you, not for a moment.

In case you're wondering, I've decided to try to stay on suboxone as long as possible and sort my life out. Before this choice, my plan was just to move to Cambodia or Laos so I can buy opium from certain bars and just drift around until I die one day.

I may not have written it that well, but this is a warning for all the people considering using this drug class now and again. You never know when losing a job, losing a spouse, losing your house, losing a family member, gaining a mental illness, or moving into new social environments may completely change your outlook on use.

You tell yourself it's too expensive, it's too dangerous, etc., but if you want to get blasted for $2-10/day, those options are out there if you just look. You might think youd never do RCs or fentalogues, but you'll have that nasal spray much more quickly than you'd realize.

DON'T LOOK for cheap highs, and make sure you recognize these obstacles against daily use are all a joke. 

The flood gates of mental addiction can open any time. Do you really want to make yourself vulnerable to this for the rest of your life, just to feel good a few times?

Tl;dr I was a bona fide Chipper for over a decade, until I wasnt. This can and likely will happen to you eventually. Its easy to chip successfully when life is good. What will happen when you hit an obstacle?",1544549335.0

Any personal experience? Better alternatives?

I turned to opiates for the sense of well being as an alternative to suicide. I had a date & a plan, so I figured why not.

It was actually going pretty well, got myself into therapy, started investing in my well being... unfortunately sourcing is an issue now & I'm doing a taper while staving off withdrawal with some super pure kratom alkaloids. I don't mind being a functional addict, but I'm not willing to live a junkie's life so no cold copping & being on the brink of disaster & w/d for me.

* 56% mitragynine
* 15% paynantheine
* 11% speciogynine
* 16% Speciociliatine

by weight, which is pretty effective.

Had I started this from a position of strength I would have gotten a big supply of a synthetic opioid with nice long legs & tried to minimize my tolerance with ultra low doses of naltrexone.

Unfortunately those are all gone as far as I know & I couldn't get them if they were.

So what are my options?  I have health insurance, but even a medically assisted detox will leave me at best in the same situation I was before this started.

It's ironic that the state couldn't be arsed to get involved during my decade of childhood physical & emotional abuse, neglect, alienation from all friends, families or allies while being raised by a woman with a personality disorder. That fucked up my brain chemistry pretty well,

But as an adult tax payer who never hurt anyone, once I start to tweak it back the state needs to intervene.

Right away I knew it was off in weight but I didn't have my scale with me (I won't drive with a scale since that is considered to be paraphernalia i.e. felony charge) so I headed home at a crawl so I could weigh it and get confirmation on what I already believed was a purposefully planted, total mental mind fuck. I kept going back and forth in my head... ""This isn't off by that much, I'm just blowing this out of proportion in my head!"" To ""Holy shit, he totally fucking gave me a shitload of dope! He had to have done it on purpose to see if I'd be honest and let him know about the mistake quick enough to prove that I'm a loyal customer?"" Which one is it? What am I!? A loyal adict or a thief? Of course I'm freaking out more and more as the moments pass. It takes about 30 minutes to get home after scoring, so every second that passes that I don't call him and explain the situation to make it right, is a possible strike against me and a possible lost connect. But I couldn't even fathom calling without getting the confirmation in my head on what was exactly given to me. Mistake or not. So I drove home in a sweat, continuously palming and squeezing the huge chunks in my hands trying to guess the amount of dope I had been given and running through the various scenarios that could have possibly transpired. As more and more time passes, I'm also trying to determine if I should even say anything. If he had realized his mistake then I surely would have received a call by now. 5 minutes turn to 10 and I'm just shaking and sifting through the different options. Can I just pretend I got the right amount? Would he be able to tell or figure out who was given the wrong amount? How many people did he sell to tonight? How many people does he have running for him? Was the guy himself reliable? Does he have a habit and he's just totally out of it right now and doesn't know what he's doing? I could just pretend that I got my normal amount.. I'd have saved over $4000 worth of dope by just keeping my mouth shut. Holy crap that's a shit load of money I could save.
I finally get home and weigh it and it says 60gs. My frantically beating heart drops into my stomach and I realize I've got to be honest and call my dboy to explain what happened or I could risk a shit storm I'm not prepared for. He didn't even fucking realize he had given me the wrong amount. Jesus. He asks me to drive to meet him to return the extra dope and promptly hangs up. I'm sitting there pissed off and then I immediately get a call back. ""Go ahead and take 4g's for yourself. Thanks!""

Wow.. Thanks? Gotta change my soiled shorts and I'll be right there.

I was prescribed 16mg a day and had about a week or two long run of using. I started my Bupe again today. I‚Äôve taken 12mg today. 

I want to do as quick of a taper as I can so I can get the 7-10 days of clean time free from all opiates to start Vivitrol. 

I plan on telling my provider about my slip on Wednesday at my appointment. Until then I‚Äôll continue taking the Bupe that I do have. I have a few doses left. 

So obviously I haven‚Äôt been on 16mg like I should be so what do you guys suggest? Start taking the 16 again and then tell my provider I want to do a rapid taper? What do you guys suggest? I‚Äôm pretty dead set on doing rapid taper over a month or two of tapering. I just want off this stuff. 

Any comfort medicines besides clonidine, methocarbanol, and something for anxiety, that I should ask for?

Please help! I‚Äôm desperate and just want off this shit. If you don‚Äôt have anything helpful to provide or share please just leave those to yourself. I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick, I just want helpful information.

I don't mind giving them a bump here and there, but as we know the cost of pills adds up, particularly when you make $10 an hour, even though I do get a great deal$ on them, still expensive when you have the tolerance of a lab monkey (sorry PETA).

   They, as a couple def pull more money than me, but they cringe at the possibility of spending $7-$10 on a pill (for 20 mg), as I have offered to purchase pills for them or sell them a few of mine. When I have them they suddenly want to get together, phone calls are more frequent etc.

Granted, I am much much more social on them as well, and they are the only people that would be cool with it...so it is nice having the company at times but I do laugh to myself. Also, if the shoes were reversed I would be the same way, but at least I would pay for them. I am not angry or resentful but I recently gained clarity of the situation and it kind of makes me laugh as they are not subtle. 

   They seem to be aggravated (would never admit) when I have told them I can't afford to share with them all the time. They are friends beyond the drugs it is just funny how it changes the dynamics of SO MANY relationships.

Now, I have a friend who sells it. Has been asking if I want any, I might.

Idk if I‚Äôm even gonna get any. Opiates aren‚Äôt my thing but the H high did feel nice once the nausea went away haha... I‚Äôm just curious about these prices honestly. Seem weird to me, almost like coke prices.

With Dopiny Blastit (lol I really tried there , do better plz) kinda bitch shit post 0_o","Welp. The last few days have proven to be a royal fuck fest. Let me start off by saying I moved to a new town to be closer to family and I know no one. There are about 1000 ppl total , no visible homeless I can see , no clinic and no fucking hope. So in hopes of being prepared, I decided I'd just save a little money each day until I had enough to grab a ball that could last me a few weeks hopefully until I'd have to make another trip , make an order , set up delivery , or just whatever would work . Dope is super fuckin expensive where I'm from , but you can travel in any direction about 90 miles and cut your cost.  I arranged with my plug last week that I'd give him a ride to pick up and he would hook me on a ball at cost.  Great , yup , everything is seeming wonderfully planned right ? 

So a couple days ago I'm getting my stuff ready and a buddy stops by to score some clean darts . The good Samaritan that I am obliges. He stops by with a few friends , i run to grab a bag, come back and they're all gone.  Weird . Hour later I'm calling plug to get set up ,  all good . Go to get my ducks aka money in a row and my savings is gone.  You can guess what happened . Yes my dumbass left my loot in a semi open place , being my dresser drawer. Don't know if someone saw me put it there or what but clearly they knew what they were after.  With friends like these right man? 

Well fuck right.  While I'm freaking out about the bread being gone; the plug gets impatient , grabs another lift and bolts without me. Great, I've got a little cash left not close to what I saved but could keep me straight a few days.  Meanwhile plug decides they're staying overnight and I gotta get outta town.  Buy local I decide. Go thru my like #3-4 plug who answers first and is within reason on prices. Go to grab, make exchange , drive off, open up , taste .... And it's a mix of what I think is crushed cookies and meth.  Great.  Go to call/text dude , has me blocked. Well that validates the fact he duffed me. Now I'm pretty much broke at this point right ? Hit up a slew of ppl that owe me money , come up with something at least . (All this while I'm way late getting to my new place) Onto plug #2 , never failed me.  Grab an hg of some ""new stuff"".  Open the bindle check it out first : looks good , tastes ok like pretty bad.  K get it home set my rig up , do less then normal dose to be safe . Nothing. Do a little more. Nothing.  Ok well I can't do the whole hg possibly and not feel anything.  Fuck, yup sure did.  Hit up plug 2, he can't believe it.  Acting like I'm trying to cop free shit but says he'll make it right when he gets back .... In a week. Great.  

I'm outta funds , outta options , don't get paid til next week now . I've literally been asking the homies and fam for like 20 bucks at least to get me thru my first day unpacking and getting settled.  Family is tense, just lost someone to suicide.  Lost both grandparents the last few months. Dad's getting worse in dementia. Mom's killing herself drinking vodka from dusk til dawn. 


I'm just throwing my hands up like , what's next man? I'm starting WD, dude that could front is outta town , I'm supposed to leave like yesterday. Ill be sick soon and I'm feeling pretty screwed  I tried to plan everything to avoid this kinda thing . Saved my loot like a responsible drug addict lol and here I sit , robbed and duffed. I can't even describe how I feel , like numb but defeated , angry but emotionally dead. Feel free to validate my ridiculously long antedote regarding my own stupid misfortune. Probably that could have been avoided , but alas I can't go back and now I'm broke and screwed.

All I can discern from Glassdoor is that it's an ""extensive"" urine test.  I do know that if I get the conditional offer, I can't exactly ask them for 5 days before taking the test without raising suspicion.  If I get an offer on Wednesday, I'd assume I need to test on Friday. I also know they use a chain like Quest or something, so I don't think I'd be observed.

I take 70 mg of Vicodin per day and have for a long time.  I'm female, 140 pounds.

I took Vicodin last at 9 p.m. Sunday.  I was thinking of taking kratom for a few days to help with WD, but I don't know if this test will include that, so I'd have to stop that in a day or two.

Or, I could get synthetic urine.  I do not have anyone I can ask for clean urine.  I looked at the drug test links on here, and it looks like there are some good options.

Has anyone done an extensive test and passed with synthetic?  I'm thinking like DOT test.

This is all sidestepping my philosophical objection to a job that tests for a desk jockey position, but that's my own issue.  Right now I'm temping and I need permanent to get insurance to get in pain management.

TLDR: Drug test in 4-5 days.  Kick Vicodin and pray, or go synthetic?

Leaving my trash laying around or accidentally dropping a empty has got me fucked up with the police, girl friends and family, so now to avoid any slip-ups I chew them up beyond recognition and spit them out the window, flush them down the toilet or just throw them in the trash. Well not any more.
   About a hour ago I was getting ready to crash and rationing out my dope for the next couple days. I figured tomorrow I will be at work so to make things easier I will just put 4 bags into one. My thought was that I would walk around the corner and use my little straw cut at a 45 to scoop up a nice bump and get right back to work before anyone noticed anything. These bags I am getting at the moment are super fat and after I combined the 4 I had a monster bag that looked amazing. After i flicked it to the bottom and compacted it, it was well past the first fold, if I had to guess I'd say it was between .5g and .6g. 
   After I finished my handiwork I went to my stash and grabbed another bag to do before relaxing and going to bed. I do, and when I finished I throw the stamp into the little pile of empties... which is right next to the monster bag. In one motion, not thinking, I sweep up *all* the bags on my dresser and chew them up for a minute and throw them in the trash. Feeling pretty good, I go outside for a smoke, though my joy is short lived. On my way to bed I glance at my dresser and to my horror my ration for tomorrow is no where to be found. That's when it hit me, i fucking chewed it up along with the trash. 
   These bags are a lot stronger then ones i usually get, my first though was that I just killed myself. If I were to snort 4 of these I would be pushing daisies for sure. Just one gets me well if I am sick and I nod pretty heavily after 2. Thankfully I just ruined my dope and didn't consume all of it, those little glassine bags are pretty tough. My next thought was that I am a fucking idiot, now I am 4 bags short and am going to be be sick sooner then anticipated. FML, I am praying that JJ makes something happen by the end of the week.

So today picked up some stuff with my friends and I shot it up as usual but it had this very scarily intense rush, I got this weird tingling burning sensation in my hands and feet but it wasnt pins and needles it was a very different feeling my friends and I all thought we were dying at first because we couldnt breathe and our hearts were racing and the whole ordeal lasted about a few seconds then we all calmed  down and were fine but after that we werent very high at all and you would think after a scary intense rush like that, that you would be in nod city but no. I really want to know if anyone has ever experienced this same rush before? Oh I should also add that I did a wash and I missed the shot but instantly got that same powerful rush which I wouldnt normally get a rush at all if I missed which is why I'm curious if anyone else has ever had something like this before or maybe knows what the cut was it kind of had a weird taste to it too my friend said it kinda almost had a bleach taste to it and he got super dizzy and confused.",1544424293.0

I'm not one much for speedballing (or whatever you call it If its with meth)  for several reasons, normal amphetamines completely mask the opiate high and I dont feel them, just the stim. If I'm doing the traditional eith coke, it's like the effects of both drugs come in waves, one minute I feel the warmth of the dope, and the next I'm feeling my heart pounding and shit, and that's not too comfortable. BUT HOLY FUCKING SHIT, METH AND HEROIN. Like my eyes were pinned as fuck and i was about to nod, and then my boy put the bubble in front of me and was like ""this shit is that fire, straight jet fuel, just hit it"" (this stuff was like strsight shards, no powder, and was almost completely transparent, crushed into fine white powder, and cracked back like instantly... I dont do meth a whole lot. But I know enough meth heads, to know what good meth should be like, at least I think) so I'm like, ok, let's do it, whatever, blow some meth clouds, and like two fucking big ass clouds in, i was FUCKING LIT. Like its really hard to describe how I felt, but it was amazing. I was hitting fire meth, but my pupils were still pinned as fuck, and like fuck, I wish I had more vocabulary to be able to describe how good it felt. Like so good.... and that's the scary part.

I got extreme hard veins to hit since I am born. And I am very scarred of needles which I am a bit more ok with now. I tried IV about 10 times and only hit a vein 3 times. Even nurses and doctors have it very hard to hit them. I once had a trainee nurse who hit me 20 times untill the doc said he will do it and he also needed 5 tries. I was child back then and since then I am scared of needles but I am ok with that now. I tried IV now 10 times and only hit 3 times ,2 times only a bit intothe vein the rest was missed. And once all in my veins and holy shit loved I the rush. Man its not describal. Anyways since I dont know any otger junkies whom could give me any advives I ghought I will ask here. And yes I know there is the sidebar post but I got veins which are called durectly translated running veins. As soon the needle goes through the skin the vein will roll tonthe left or right side. So this makes it much Harder too. Amd I can only hit in the hands and feets and now in the winter into the crrok of my elbowsLArms too since J only wear pullis, seater and jackets so no on one wil see my upper arms. Since everyone thinks I am clean right now ans I want that it stays that way maybe someone can help me out. I mean from that great stuff I even go to  nodcity by sniffing it and not too much but I boofed it on saturday and the rush was so extremly strong that Inat least want to know how IV feels with this dope.

I thought I'd stay that way for the rest of high school, go to college, get a job, get married, have kids, and just be a happy & successful person. Literally one year later, I started getting depressed over failed relationships with girls and turned to alcohol & xanax. I eventually found the girl who I thought was the solution to my depression halfway through my Junior year, but she just turned out to be the worst one of the bunch. I thought I'd get clean for her, and jump back onto my train to success. Nope. Not even two weeks into knowing her, she was clearly problematic, and I decided to keep using, eventually moving onto cocaine. Her and I were on and off all of 2018 up until the beginning of our Senior year. I have now dropped out of school and I am addicted to heroin. Heroin is the only drug that felt like an actual solution to my depression. I started fucking with this girl who got me into heroin, and I thought I was over the previous girl. A couple of days ago my family and friends have caught onto the fact that I am using heroin. I didn't know what to do, so I cut off the heroin girl and started detoxing at home. I genuinely thought I was over my previous girlfriend up until the point that I stopped using. Out of no where, she started haunting my thoughts again. I miss her. She was my everything. I don't know which I love more, heroin or Paige. While laying in bed, wanting to cut my legs off, I can't help but reminisce about the good times with Paige. Why did she have to leave me? Why couldn't we work it out? I won her back towards the end of July 2018, I thought I had it all figured out, I was 2 weeks clean off of all substances, now I'm a high school drop out junkie loser heroin user. I didn't realize that I was using heroin to numb the pain of the break up. Why am I like this? I threw so many opportunities out the window in the name of love for this girl.

&#x200B;

A week after she left me, they found 3 tumors running down the middle of my brain. The tumors are noncancerous, but inoperable and growing. They also diagnosed me with multiple sclerosis.

Yesterday after a month of planning, she was going to allow me to take the dogs to the park. I waited 6 hours at the park, she texted me saying she changed plans. She also told me she should've left me a long time ago and she stopped loving me about 7 months ago.

I accidentally texted her, ""call me."" so she blocked my number. I love someone who hates me, has destroyed my image, taken everything I love from me. I am slowly losing my health, my brain is slowly being pushed up against my skull.

The hop has me nodded hard.

Most of the afternoon, I guess, and when I wake up there‚Äôs a kink in my neck. A bad one. It is something I have had to deal with ever since I got a bad chiropractic adjustment. Not by a chiropractor though, and in retrospect, I should have known not to trust the guy as he‚Äôd ripped me off for a hundred dollars just a few weeks before when he sold me a half empty bottle of eyedrops as LSD. Anyway, my neck has had problems since, and the kid is standing over me pulling on my sleeve and asking for a cigarette. It‚Äôs annoying, but I pull the pack out of my pocket and toss it onto the coffee table. He grabs one out and lights it up. There‚Äôs more daylight out than I expected to see.

‚ÄúHey. What do you think about this?‚Äù

The kid poses in the Captain Morgan stance. His foot rests on the coffee table. The cigarette hangs from his lips and his face is ratcheted to the side like Popeye the Sailor man. He rolls up the leg of his jeans revealing what older generations might call a carbuncle, unsightly and excruciating in its appearance. It is the size of a tangerine and marbled in sickly swirls of infected yellow and a gangrenous purplish black interrupted by pockets of angry red bleeding.

‚ÄúI think you need to go the hospital.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Doesn‚Äôt it hurt?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Looks painful as hell.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúIt is. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve stayed away. I don‚Äôt need some idiot in a white coat stabbing at it and pressing on it and all that crap.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. But you need antibiotics, bro. Otherwise, you might be some idiot with his leg cut off or dead or worse. I promise. I‚Äôll go with you. There‚Äôs a doc in the box not too far from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll just absorb back into my body and go away?‚Äù He says ‚Äòegg zorb‚Äô instead of absorb.

‚ÄúYeah. Really. Let‚Äôs go, after we get out and get the medicine, though, I want you to take me to meet your sister in law or whatever she is. The stripper who buys a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, dude, whatever you want.‚Äù

35

The girl at the front desk requires 400 dollars before she‚Äôll schedule us in.

I pay. It‚Äôs not much to me at this point, but the kid is sitting in the waiting room trying to make the remote work and having this half-hearted conversation with a bald guy about the Mariners. I sit across from them and the bald guy starts trying to tell jokes. The jokes aren‚Äôt funny.

It‚Äôs a problem Seattle has seemed to have ever since my dad died. People‚Äôs senses of humor just aren‚Äôt that good, and even though, I can‚Äôt honestly say I remember them ever being better than they are now, it really does seem like Seattle got less funny when my dad left us. Everyone in Seattle is always laughing at their own jokes. Whatever, though. It‚Äôs just how it is anymore. Makes me miss my dad today listening to this guy try to tell me a joke.

The kid is not paying attention to any of it, though. He‚Äôs just moving that remote through the air and now he‚Äôs standing on the chair. The remote‚Äôs still not working.

‚ÄúHere. Let me try.‚Äù I say. The waiting room is small and to my left another man sits with his lower lip hanging off his face like a piece of busted rubber or something. Every bit of his gums and teeth is exposed. A strand of drool hangs from his mouth and drips onto his shirt, and the man is breathing hard. I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs farted or if it‚Äôs just his breath that stinks so bad.

The bald man has been called back. He limps away. I get the remote and make it work on my first try. The kid throws his hands up.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWisdom comes with age, my friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, whatever. Let me try again.‚Äù

He snatches the remote from me and tries. It still doesn‚Äôt work.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name anyway?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúCharlie, bro. You know that.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should. We went to the same NA meeting for a year or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue. Guess I was in my own world. Thanks, though, for inviting me to that game.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem. Say you think I‚Äôm gonna be okay?‚Äù There is a genuine fear in his eyes.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lose my leg.‚Äù

A fat nurse steps out into the lobby. She holds a clipboard and stares at it. ‚ÄúCharles Pulaski!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù He stands up and turns back to me. ‚ÄúYou coming?‚Äù

I stand up and walk with him to the exam room. It is cold and bathed in sterile white light. Scents of bleach and other astringent cleaners float in the air. He sits on the table, and after a minute, the doctor comes in.

The doctor is nice enough. He makes appropriate small talk and doesn‚Äôt sneer in disgust at the sight of the abscess on the kid‚Äôs leg but instead shows compassion and orders a shot of lidocaine and ten milligrams of diazepam for him. The doctor lances and drains the infection and walks out. Charlie cries in pain until he sleeps a moment on the table. After the nurse comes back with a prescription for amoxicillin, we walk out. The daylight drifts into night. I take him to fill it and back to my apartment where I hook him up with another shot to sleep it off. He calls his sister in law and sets up an appointment for me. I leave him sleeping on the couch.

36

I walk a while in the night and drizzle.

And eventually catch a bus that should get me close to the club where the girl works. Public transit is something I avoid anymore. It‚Äôs so slow. There‚Äôs no reason for me to, anyway. A 40-dollar cab ride or whatever it would be isn‚Äôt much for me these days. I‚Äôve got rubber banded rolls of cash, so much that I don‚Äôt even know how much I actually have. Counting it is a chore at this point. So, I just keep it in a few shoeboxes in the crawl space in my hallway and limit counting it to times that I am going to reup or pay something or someone‚Äôs giving me a bundle for the dope I sell them. You have to count it sometimes. Other than that though, I carry a couple thousand or so in my pocket. It‚Äôs enough for what I need and everything I don‚Äôt.

On the bus a dark old man with black boogers matted into the hairs hanging from his nose and rancid malt liquor on his breath wraps his arm around me and pushes his nose into my neck and face and babbles warm words. His breath and brain are wet with liquor, and brown tobacco spit dribbles into his beard. It tickles and stinks. I laugh. He tells me that he‚Äôs from Cambodia, but other than that, he makes no sense. Maybe, he‚Äôs speaking Cambodian, but it sounds like gibberish. I want to be kind, but the smell is too much for me, so I push him off to move up a seat and turn around to hand him a twenty.

The scene reminds me of this stupid story I made up, once, about an angry old man who rides public transportation all day giving out very bad and unsolicited advice to everyone he meets, which is literally the most ridiculous and terrible storyline I could dream up. Most of my stories are that. Extremely bad jokes. Life is like a bad joke, and I get to thinking about the twenty bucks I just gave the Cambodian guy and how it won‚Äôt help him. Like Charlie. I gave him what he wanted. Heroin won‚Äôt actually help him, though. Not in the long run. There are others hurt by it. Beth comes to mind and the last time I saw her with Sal. He‚Äôd been beating her. She overdosed the next day at Tony‚Äôs place.

I think about her daughter. I think about myself, and it hurts. There is such turmoil in my chest, a pair of rats gnawing at a cage made of wire. I call Beth and look out the window. It rings. Maybe if I could transport myself in time and space to a graveyard on a hill over looking Los Angeles in the searing August heat of 1991, maybe that would fix it somehow. Although, I can‚Äôt figure out how it would, and I don‚Äôt know where in the hell a thought like that comes from. It feels right, though. It feels like it would make things better. That, or a lobotomy. Before, I can think much of my frontal lobe being snipped and scrambled or long needled syringes full of silicone going in behind the eyeball, the line rings again and Beth picks up.

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù Her voice bends in its despair.

‚ÄúSup? How‚Äôre ya doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúMmmm‚Ä¶ you know. What about you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell.‚Äù

‚ÄúGuess business‚Äôs good for you. Haven‚Äôt seen ya in a few weeks.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúGeorge found out what was going on. My mom and sister came and took my daughter from me, but it‚Äôs for the best. It just sucks.‚Äù Her voice breaks.

‚ÄúProbably. I haven‚Äôt seen you with Sal.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me started. It‚Äôs been bad, Randy. Real bad. I‚Äôm starting the suboxone program tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Good.‚Äù I hang on the line and don‚Äôt say anything.

She says, ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..,‚Äù looking for me to end the conversation or tell her I‚Äôm coming over or something.

‚ÄúBeth?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Randy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. You know? I never meant for all of this to happen. It just sorta did.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. I‚Äôm grown up. I made my decisions. Not you. So keep it to yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWish it made me feel better.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù She stays quite a moment. ‚ÄúMe too, Randy. If I could just wake up from this. You know?‚Äù Sounds like tears are in her eyes.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôll talk to you soon. Call me if you need anything. Really, Beth. Anything. I can help.‚Äù

Calling her hasn‚Äôt made me feel any better. She wouldn‚Äôt even let me apologize, but it‚Äôs hard to see how it would have fixed anything anyhow. The sadness dissipates by the time I get off the bus and walk the last few blocks up to the strip club. I call the kid‚Äôs ex-sister-in-law. She tells me to meet her behind the club and is standing next to the dumpster when I make the corner. She says,

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre the guy?‚Äù I hear her say it in person and over the phone.

I talk back into the phone and directly to her. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

We both laugh. She puts her phone into the side pocket of her coat and says,

‚ÄúMy car‚Äôs parked down the block. Walk with me.‚Äù She takes off down the sidewalk. Her stilettos click on the cement. Whatever perfume she‚Äôs wearing wafts back to me as I follow and parked out front of a dirty white house is a small Dodge Neon. We both get in. I sit shotgun. She sits behind the wheel.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got 150 bucks.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright. Well usually I sell grams for 100‚Ä¶,‚Äù and before I can tell her that I‚Äôll give her two for the 150 dollars, she says,

‚ÄúGive me one now and let me go dance for an hour. I‚Äôll get another one off of you lickety split, if you just wait. Go inside. Get a drink or a lap dance or something. It won‚Äôt take long. I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù I hand her a prebagged gram and get out with her. We walk back slowly. She doesn‚Äôt say anything until we get back to the club.

‚ÄúK. Go inside and hang out for a bit. I‚Äôll call you as soon as I‚Äôm ready.‚Äù

I walk in and get a Sprite from the bar. It‚Äôs cold and sweet and the plastic cup is wet in my hand. I meander around watching the few men with their bills and the girls dancing for them. Lynyrd Skynyrd plays. Pretty soon Charlie‚Äôs ex-sister-in-law makes an appearance on stage. She‚Äôs quite short. Almost some kind of dwarf or something and has a scar on her stomach like a jagged bolt of lightning. It‚Äôs not so easy to see in the dark, but it‚Äôs there. On the other end of the stage a taller girl with a big face and mouth and a thick pair of thoroughbred thighs dances awkwardly, and I start to feel embarrassed for them in a way. Not like I‚Äôm better than they are or anything like that, but I do. It just makes me embarrassed, so I look away from the stage and wander through a set of velvet curtains and a doorway to the back.

Reggaeton thumps over the speakers back here. Pink and green neon tubes glow along the walls and above our heads. In one corner a white light strobes next to a fat man with a headset, and in another corner a girl lap dances for a man in a chair. It‚Äôs hard for me to see from the distance. Other girls talk amongst themselves. A stripper with cigarette breath walks toward me asks me if I want a dance. She must be the oldest girl in the place. I say,

‚ÄúNah. I‚Äôm just looking around,‚Äù and shake the ice in my cup at her. I‚Äôm not sure why. Maybe, I‚Äôm subconsciously indicating my lack of interest in hers or anyone else‚Äôs services there, and even though I‚Äôm not interested--I‚Äôm really not--something over her shoulder catches my eye.

It‚Äôs a thin girl with a dark face and a straight blonde wig. She is looking directly at me. Her shoulders point down in collapsed posture. Her irises are black charcoal, and the white of those desperate eyes shine wet. They swell in sadness. I turn my focus back to the older one I just shook my drink at,

‚ÄúWhat about her?‚Äù I point with my chin to the frail and delicate figure sulking behind her.

‚ÄúHer?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. What‚Äôs her name?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, honey. Why don‚Äôt you ask her? I think it‚Äôs her first night.‚Äù

The older stripper steps out of the way letting me get full view of the girl behind her. She stands there as sad as I thought she looked just a moment before. I ask her,

‚ÄúYou give lap dances?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor me?‚Äù

She nods at me chewing her fingernail. The girl turns and walks toward a chair across the room and turns to see me still standing there. It may sound clich√©, but she really is like something from my dreams, and this whole scene something I‚Äôve done before. I think it‚Äôs what they call D√©j√† vu. You know? I have this theory about it which is that the reason we find ourselves in situations which seems so familiar is that we‚Äôve done all these things an infinite number of times into eternity past as the universe and time explode out of nothing to create everything and collapse back in on themselves and do it all over and over again into eternity. She moves slowly in this dreamy fog, an angel in the darkness. I recognize her. I know her. I snap out of it and follow her to a chair against the wall.",1544335532.0

Having no money means little hobbies. Years of being an addict has lead me to having very little non-addict friends. 

This has made sobriety boring. Go to work, come home, watch TV or play videos, go to bed, and then repeat.

When I'm using...that's a whole different lifestyle. It's just exciting. Hanging out with your addict friend and trying to cold cop at 2AM. Middling for someone and getting a big sack for it is better than a paycheck with overtime. Hanging out in trap houses meeting random ass people. Feeling the rush of a good pickup, knowing it's going to last you longer than any you've had this month. Snorting lines in a public bathroom with your buddy...

The lifestyle is more of a high than dope ever will be. Imagine using dope off the DNMs for a couple months and that's all you use. It would be BORING AS SHIT. ",1544335281.0

God. Only took like a week of use for me to feel a difference when I ran out. That bitch is sneaky ! 

Anyone else randomly buy a g of black and just assume you won't like it ? Anyone ? Am I the only complete moron here ? Probably. If I end up spiraling down into a hole of opiate addiction, at least I didn't start with a script.  I'm tired of that statistic being spouted off.  The scripts made me \*avoid\* heroin for the longest time because I get so ill on oxy, hydro and codeine. Fuckers I started by injecting heroin, I just went straight to end game. 

Thankfully, I have been more careful than the oral surgeon I had a decade ago who overdosed me with fentanyl and I had to be narcanned awake. Holy fuck that isn't fun, even if you're not addicted. I hadn't ever taken opiates and my first experience was an overdose with the misfortune of also having versed in the mix so I don't even remember the good part!

But yeah. Heroin is pretty fucking amazing. This ain't gonna end well... I'm officially out again and am resisting picking up. Wish me luck with making do with the kilo of kratom I've had forever. I wish you could smoke kratom....

Now I'm not here to lecture on saftey or anything but just be aware, when you snap a photo on one of these smartphones it also convienently saves a ton of info; everything from the exact GPS location of where it was taken, the device info and more.. that you may or may not want the world to know as It can essentially identify you without any effort as its embedded in the photo.

Just going through some of the more recent posts and pulled a few to see and sure enough people aren't always taking that step.

I have heard reddit may include this in the future by stripping the photo of exif but for now, just be aware.

You can always remove the exif data very easily with one of many free apps that strip it free of any info whatsoever and takes almost no effort, just one step prior to posting that could be of interest to those who'd rather keep that info to themselves.

I understand many do not care and I respect that and am not telling you what to do. I'm simply pointing this out to anyone who may not be aware that they can prevent this very easily and quite frankly I'm pretty sure many wouldn't want their personal information attatched to a drug post.

I‚Äôm kind of curious about trying intranasal heroin though? I don‚Äôt hold any stigma about IV/IMing I just have an aversion to it. I have a few questions:
1) how would the high differ from the feeling of oxy or hydro?
2) is the addiction potential significant compared to other things I take?
3) what are appropriate steps towards harm reduction? (Narcan obviously)
4) what dose would you recommend to start?

It‚Äôs from the darkweb and I think it might be laced.,"The vendor was popular, there were so many reviews saying the H was legit so I went for it. I‚Äôm an inexperienced H user only  used heroin three times before when I smoked some black tar. 

Reasons I believe it could be something else:
‚Ä¢ When it kicks I cant see straight. My eyes feel weird and I need to close one eye in order to read words on my phone otherwise all the words are blurry and crossed over each other. 
‚Ä¢ When I close my eyes to go to sleep if I am still high, I start to hear weird shit. Like almost dream like shit while I am still awake. 
‚Ä¢ After an hour and a half (ROA = snorting) it starts to feel much much less intense and my vision slowly goes back to normal
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôve been using for 9 days, multiple times per day. I used a little too much today and now only 2 hours after snorting my head starts killing me, I feel nauseous (thrown up twice), weak, and aggravated.
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs much weaker than 99% 
‚Ä¢ I experience a calm contentness but I‚Äôve never felt Euphoria even after plugging good amounts

This powder smells similar to black tar when snorted. When I smoke it I feel very out of it and almost high like I just faced a joint. I don‚Äôt like how it feels so I have  only been snorting. Smoking makes it way more noticeable. 

I am easing off this shit with Kratom and very very small amounts of heroin to ease the headaches and vomiting. ",1544252889.0

Are any of you happy? Like when you look deep inside of yourself (if you can even do that anymore... I think I'm losing that) do you see a happy person? 

I don't. I see someone who is unwhole. I see a body without a soul. When I look into my own eyes, and concentrate, I see just.... Eyes. And maybe I'm crazy? Maybe I don't need to sound so profound and shit. I just feel like I really lost my happiness in drug use. 

Do all addicts face their demize at some point or another? Am I demonizing myself and it's not all that bad?

I know the answer to none of this. I only know that I don't get high anymore and I don't enjoy anything else anymore.... every person I meet takes off. With good reason, I'm a fucking walking disaster piece of shit. 

I hope you all feel more worth than I do for now.... Sometimes I think ""bitch I'm fuckin cool and smart and gosh darn it people like me!"" But that's about 10% and the other 90% is an incredibly morbid pessimistic human who knows my most likely untimely and ultimate doom will stem from my addiction.

Hello Guys & Girls hope your having a fab friday !
I did use the search button but i have so many questions!

I have a fairly high codeine dose 300-400mg and im new to opiates.
Will be doing half the pill so about 12-20 mg , hard to be  spot on with a razor blade, tried to be as gentle as possible without crushing the pill


Q1)
I have read that 10-20mg is a good starting dose , the problem is the pills have no split line running down the middle , so people say its a bad idea to cut them yourself?

Due to the fact its not very accurate (unless you have a pilcutter) and there could be more substance in one side of the pill compared to others?

Q2)
How long should i wait to redose>

q3) I took 25mg promethinze 30 mins before taking oxy, to counter attack the itchness/ nause.
Is this a good dose , as i dont want to take to much promethainze due to its sedating effect and for respiratory depression side effect..

Q4) When is best time frame to drop the anti histamine ( promethinze)

Before / During/ After coming up? The last option dos not sound to good because it says like its late to the part and the Oxycontin would of caused histamines to be released = Nause/Itchness.

q5) What would be a safe time frame (Hours) to go to sleep?

q6) How long after taking oxy dos it usually take to start working?
Q7) Are prolonged release pills a crap high compared to  standard pill?",1544222765.0

I see him talking to someone but they have their hood up and I can't make out who it is but it turns out to be someone I know and he's a right thieving bastard ! He can't help him self every shop etc he goes in he steals something even when he doesn't need to and you need to watch him like a hawk if he's in your house. He asks my new dealer if he's looking for any kit (heroin) or valium but my guy doesn't need any . He then tells me his friend got his heroin about a half Oz ,¬£80 and 27 strips of valium stolen when he fell a sleep and this guy was in the house and he asked him to keep his ear to the ground . So this just confirmed it ! Stuff goes missing and this idiot starts punting ! Lol doesn't take a genius to figure this out ! 

  We get to my house and he asks me if I have any foil and scales as they are all made up into half grams and i just want a bag .I tell him the foil is no problem but the two sets of scales I have are both fucked and need calibrated and I don't have the proper weights to calibrate them . So we will have to do it by eye and he lets me do it so I put out the powder onto a DVD case and make it into a rectangle and half it down diagonal and obviously take the bigger half for myself . He put his on the foil and I cook mine up, the powder is a bit darker in colour than the stuff I've been getting recently and it's pretty good stuff so this stuff is going to have some competition on its hands. I shoot it up and I feel it in my nose and start getting pins and needles across the back of my neck and scalp . Not bad ! Not bad indeed ! I was quite surprised as the stuff in town was quite good itself. 
           So after he's smoked his he phoned his friend and tells him about that idiot trying to sell him kit and valium. A couple of hours go by and we have a couple of nice cappacinoes in my new machine and I make him some wheatabix  and some boiled eggs(4) in a cup mashed up in some butter and some salt. 

 I end up getting another bag from him and he does one himself but this time he wants to inject and I have loads of new tools(syringes) but his veins are total shit. So I tell him I'll get him in the groin not a problem and his face lights up. Cook up the bags and I do mine first a boom what a rush ! On top of that first bag I get a really good hit and feel a bit funny I almost say to him to keep an eye on me and where the Naloxone is but it passed and I feel alright . I get him not a problem and he gets a really good dunt from it and we are both high as kites ! (I must be still high as fuck coz this is turning into a book ! Lol ) 
          He ends up phoning  his guy to give him his money and to find out when he can pick up again . So he gets directions to mine. He turns up and I have to go to the post office to get the tenner I owe him and my friend wants to go to his bit about a mile away and this guy ain't happy about that as he says he's in a rush but he does it any way as my m8 liturary goes in the huff like a fucking 5 years old ! We end up arguing and nearly fighting because I tell him he's acting like a 5 year old . He's says do you want to sort it out outside the van and I tell him go ahead your next to the door you fucking idiot but he backs down and we head to his bit. When he's in the house I ask the guy what his prices are and if I can have his number he say yeah no problem but don't say to ***** he'll go in the huff for stealing his customer he was only adding a fiver to an eighth(¬£85) anyway so it's not like he was losing out on much.plus this guy will deliver it straight to my door . He gets back in the van and he got his trays of gabbas as someone was wanting to buy 200 of him at a fiver a tray and there's ten in a tray. He drops him off at the bookies and I ask him if he can drop me off at my house as he needs to turn around anyway and if he just follows the road after my bit it'll take him into town.
   
 So turned out not to bad today plus my m8 says he'll drop a bag off every morning about 9/10am so thats handy and he will do me tick(credit) not a problem.

  Hope everyone is having a good day and not in WD if you don't want to be or worse you have money but can't score ! All the best from bonnie Scotland !

Basically, I've been diagnosed with bipolar I for a long time now and still have yet to find the right treatment. I've been through about 10+ different treatments in my life (started about 5 years ago). I recently stopped using the Seroquel XR (quetiapine 600mg) I was prescribed and felt instant relief from suicidal ideation and weird psychotic visions. No idea why I decided to end it, it just seemed like a dangerous thing to me, even though I had been taking it for 6 months, somehow I started having a bad reaction to it.

So today I'm with my psychiatrist and nurse and ask what the next possible line of treatment is, highly suggesting stopping the antipsychotic route since I've been through 3 of them already with no success and too much sedation. The psychiatrist looks at me in a condescending way and says as long as I still take heroin it's ""too complicated"" so I should just stop and also not even consider a substitute in order to proceed.

So here I am crying next to my doctor in the heroin shooting room next to the train station (yes we have these facilities), feeling utterly blocked and misunderstood.

Does this woman thinks I can just be like ""hey yeah lets just stop taking heroin"" from one day to the next ? Doesn't she think the causality of this situation is to be turned around and maybe focus on treating core illness first ? Does she realize I haven't been off treatment like this in 5 years and I feel extremely unstable right now ?

That's it. Thanks. I just needed to vent. ",1544218638.0

1)  You accidently drop your bag into a port-a-potty toilet....

Would you go in after it? Or would you let it go? 

2) Your grandmother hands you $20 to go purchase groceries.  You've been sick for two days and have nothing to pawn, no cash.. etc 

Would you... take the money to buy dope and steal the food from the grocery store? Or get grandma her milk, bread and eggs like the good little grandchild you are and continue feeling shit?

3) You are walking home after picking up and realize that you've dropped your bag.  You back track and realize that the bag has fallen into a puddle of the greasiest,chunkiest, stinkiest pile of vomit you've ever encountered...the dope itself was loosley wrapped with plastic from a grocery store sack and is not sealed...you pluck it out and realize that some of it got wet with the vomit. 

Would you...shrug your shoulders and say.. meh? Knowing that the second you get home you plan to do it anyway or throw your hands up and say fuck it... I would rather be sick than take a chance?

4)  You are in jail and a new girl/guy gets placed into your cell.  Let's say, it's just the two of you..  your new celly explains that they have a good sized chunk of dope shoved up inside the old prison wallet but they will need help to remove it.  

Would you.. get your fingers lubed up and tell your celly to get down on all fours while you assist with the ""digging"" or.. Would you rather help them paw through their feces for the next week in hopes of being the one to find the buried treasure ? ",1544209991.0

I have been on an about 9 month (?) Ish opiate binge starting with 2 100mcg mylan fentanyl patches that almost literally fell into my lap. Cut them bitches up and stuck 'em on my butt cheeks over the course of 2 and a half weeks (this was after being clean for around 4 months.)

Fentanyl ran out, developed horrible cravings and inability to sleep. Figured out how to use the Dnm (why the fuck did that take me so long? Fuck me) got a shit ton of oxy 40's cause some dude in Europe was selling them for like $5 a pop. That lasted me a few months, never exceeding 40mg in a day but often sticking to 20/30mg. 

Ran out and decided it was time to let the love affair go (again) so ordered some subs (5) with the intent of taking 1mg a day and tapering over the course of a couple weeks as I did before. One order of 5 subs turned into 2. Then 3. Been talking subs for the past several months at the rate of 1-2mg a day. If I go 24 hours and don't do a dose I can feel the restlessness/anxiety/boredom/depression start to set in so I always go back.

Went on like this for a while until I saw some morphine 30xrs on the Dnm for what seemed like a pretty cheap price. Got 5 of them. Made the mistake of taking 2 only 24 hours after my last sub dose contrary to many peoples advice (I should have listened to you guys/the FAQ!) Next day about 36 hours later took one and chewed it up and took another one whole. 

Holy shit that had me feeling great! Ate half of the last one about 4 hours in and then the other half about 8 hours in. It's been 3 days since that last dose and I haven't taken shit except 1mg of alp to sleep. I mean, I would like to take some more opiates but I'm not really craving or having any negative side effects. I even have about 5mg of bupe just chillin. Haven't even looked at it.

What the fuck morphine. Thanks fam.

They're so hard and miserable.  I could easily go through what I have coming towards me if I didn't already know that the worst part is when the WDs end and I'm just numb. I know TV will be less enjoyable, I probably won't even enjoy playing games like I used to, social interaction will feel lackluster,  the anticipation of exciting events will be not so exciting. I've done it.  It was horrifying.  It's terrifying to think my brain just won't recognize natural positive stimulation as rewarding.  All the things I did while high were enjoyable because I was high. 

WDs aren't even on my radar. I went through months of Benz withdrawal hell.  

What I want to do is slowly taper while introducing small natural rewarding things to compensate.  I want to start with physical activities that take less mental focus. Like skating,  climbing,  swimming,  fishing,  etc.  I really don't know yet. I watch these YouTube videos of people just having so much motivation and focus and drive that I envy beyond belief. They look higher streaming a game or teaching some random hobby than I've ever been on drugs. 

There's this science channel with destin that is really popular and the guy is so unbelievably excited and happy all the time just talking about science.  I want to be excited  about anything naturally. 

I know I can't just dive into programming or something like that,  but if I can find a physical hobby and slowly start getting clean I can take baby steps.  I think I need something to take me out of my comfort zone and force me to focus on like community college.  Find a program that I may enjoy while also forcing myself to give up free time. 

What do you guys think? Does any of this make sense.  I cant just quit and be bored.  I really want it to work and enjoy real life things.  I don't want to just say I'll exercise.  If I'm going to exercise it's going to be through recreation. ",1544201947.0

&#x200B;

One of my older siblings is texting me right now.  They struggled with an opiate addiction for a long time and overcame it; we were all really proud of them.  This past year has been really rough on them.  They lost their job last month and had a really nasty breakup awhile before that.  Either way, they've been texting me a lot recently and venting (which is great just because we have not had a very emotional or honest relationship in the past, so I'm glad they feel comfortable coming to me for help), and I've been happy to provide advice.  But tonight they told me that they recently used for a couple of days and then stopped and are currently going through withdraw symptoms.

&#x200B;

Basically, what I'm worried about is just how much honesty there is here.  It's been years since they regularly used (as far as I know) but when they were using a lot there was a lot of dishonesty, theft, etc.  That was probably four years ago, maybe more, and I really want to believe them when they say that it was just a couple of days and they're working to get back off of it.  I'm just not sure how to proceed from here without being confrontational or overbearing but still knowing where they stand.

&#x200B;

They've told me that it's been eight days since they last used.  I'm worried that I'm making something out of nothing but I'm also worried that I'm not doing enough.  Their addiction years ago left a pretty huge impact on my family that we've worked really hard to rebuild from.  I'd like to believe that they are older now and more mature and know that going back to using isn't going to solve their issues, but I guess I'm also a bit cynical now.  They first starting using when I was around eleven or twelve (they were fifteen-sixteen at the time) and a lot of my pre-teen and teen years were spent feeling like a needed to hide my money/belongings or else they would steal them and sell them for drugs.  I'm now twenty-two and we have done a lot to rebuild our relationship but I still feel like I am worried about going back to that time when I didn't feel safe in my own home.

&#x200B;

Just general advice on how to navigate this would be great.  Thanks.",1544168211.0

The office was packed and a little less than half of the people were getting a weed card.   Where I live the county doesn‚Äôt allow dispensaries, closest one is 3 hours away, but there are mobile dispensaries a few times a week in town.

However, again my county doesn‚Äôt allow sales of recreational even though its legal in California.  So you need a card to buy from one of the mobile dispensary.  (Neighbor told me - I don‚Äôt smoke weed)

Oh AND the weed patients, they seem to be organized under the pill mill operational handbook also, the patients were in and out! 

FOR THE WEED KNOWLEDGABLE? 
I don‚Äôt know a lot about weed laws, I‚Äôm surprised because I thought doctors were not allowed to give cards out.  They were all paying $55, I don‚Äôt know if that means anything to you.  I thought a special doctor who only did weed cards could give them, not a primary care provider, or pain management doctor.

a3vpdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a3vpdf/having_these_weird_blackouts/,10,https://redd.it/a3vpdf,xxan_marino,Having these weird blackouts..,"So last Friday this started happening. Had to get my ativan script and they had a script of amitriptyline also that Dr had called in. Popped 2.5mg ativan and went home. I got curious and decided to try and sniff a half 25mg amitryptyline pill. Didn't like it tossed the rest of the powder but took a pill and the other half. 30 mins went by I felt regular, took another .5 ativan then went to meet my friend for a couple bags

When I met up I sniffed two bags right away and within 2 mins hopped in my car with a bun to bring to my other friend. This is where the blackout started but I was later reminded of a text and a call at this time that I vaguely remember.... Next thing I know I wake up in my car parked in a pull off spot wondering Wtf.. 10 bags still in my pocket, wallet.. But no phone.. So I went to the friends who ordered the bun and all lights are off.. Dudes car not there. But I can hear his son inside trying to be quiet. At this point I thought it was weird being only 7pm.

So I just went home for the time being since my dboy buddy was making a run. Keep in mind I don't have his or the other guys numbers at this point. Try to get myself together but just can't remember shit. Knowing this dude is the only one who can give me any answers I go there again. This time he's home. Knock on the door and the son opens gives me my sim card and tells me I gotta go I can't be here.

So I told him I have no idea what happened and where's my phone. Then the guy calls me up stairs and begins to enlighten me as he pulls every piece of my phone from a diff corner of the room lol.

He said I pulled in, got out my car and could barely walk or talk. I was nodding like an od but breathing and responding. He I guess panicked since they lost someone there in the past. And took me in my car to the spot I woke up in. Now he is an old skool guy did time for delivery blah blah. He said he was check-in on me every minute or two and each time I responded more and more. says he would of called for help if it was bad bad. Not saying he did the right thing but I woke up fine and would of been a whole lot more pissed if I was in a ambulance in precipitated wd. But obviously an od would of been absolute worst scenario. Would of love to wake up to the answers right from him but he had to get fixed.. Could of just took his order out my pocket but I guess some of his morals are still there.

So I learned my lesson and thought I knew exactly what I did wrong. Also I have never had this happen with ativan alone with dope let alone sniffing it not shooting. The dope is white most likely fent or a mixture. So everyday after this when I sniffed a bag as soon as it took effect id black out I guess. My buddy has told me I was nodding out and he was slapping me..no memory. We were in a store he says I was walking into doors and he had to help me walk back to the car. Which is when I snapped out of the black out. Then yesterday everything was goin fine. I did a bag and started rolling a blunt and went into blackout mode. Pearled the backwoods but I guess dropped it in the grass. So I snap out of this blackout all groggy with him yelling ""you just had it in ur hand"".. Im like what we looking for?lol. He did find it in the grass.

Im convinced its either the dope or the first amitryptyline/benzo blackout/od that might have fucked with my brain.. If that's possible. The other times after that I was either on 0 ativan or 1mg or less. Sorry for such long post but I want to know if anyone else has similar experience. Also I would normally not hesitate to blow 3-5 bags and used to iv way more than that. But its something about this dope. Flushing the anti depressants I want nothing to do w em. They were ""for pain"" anyway.

Then I ran out. (Didn't plan to do this so all I had was crumbs.) About 6 hours later, got the ""cells are all cramping individually"" feeling, sweating, etc. 

In a possibly very stupid move, I took 2mg of subs, remembering everyone saying ""once you're on bupe, you're fine!"" .... I'd guess I had 2-4 mg in me before this. 

An hour later: full on, terrible, flopping like a fish, the slightest draft  like 40 grit sandpaper on my skin, writhing in agony etc. Worse than turkey by far. Took 8mg more, because I would have done anything to stop it, to no effect.

So...clearly I just had enough h in me still that there was enough to be knocked off by that last 2mgs, possibly combined w/ enough of a habit that subs alone wouldn't completely stop wds. 

BUT why was this so terrible when I already had a decent amount of bupe in me? What I'm wondering is: 

(1) if I made it worse by stacking the subs with the dope (a ton of partially agonized receptors + the rest fully agonized =  more than normal)? 

OR did I just up my sub dose too soon/too much?

and (2) How much bupe do you need in your system to be sure that you won't get precipitated wds? 

(Dunno if I would try this again, but I had read a study or two about a similar, way more controlled version of this method that had great success--can anyone can remind me of it's name?)",1544146693.0

I've spoken to my parents about it and asked for help and they've been really supportive and dad has even offered to send me to a rehab and take it out of my inheritance (he's not rich so it's not like it's some massive inheritance fund, thus a 3 month rehab stint (costs about 30-40k here) would put a major dint into it but that's not my issue.  My issue is that i'm going to need a very large time window to start healing and i'll probably need about 6-12 months of really hard work to get into a less hopeless position.  Now i tried to just come off morphine and jump on to kratom but my habit is too big and the kratom wasn't holding me plus it wasn't really putting a dent in my pain.  I'm so fkn lost, i really don't know what to do at this point this seems insurmountable and i've just been crying all day.  I dont even have any money to go for a fkn swim because my habit consumes all my money and i'm not even getting high now just barely staying well and getting some pain relief.  


My options are basically try and taper with opium, its too hard with morphine because i've abused it too much. Or come clean to my doctor, ask for help get on to a pain management dose of methadone or suboxone and maybe go to rehab or go live with family and slowly work through this.  I'm just so worried that i won't be able to taper methadone or subs like i can with opium, i've read soooo many horror stories about people getting on and never coming off or facing horrendous month long WDs just when they drop a tiny dose.  When tapering things like opium, morphine you can drop your dose and you're a bit off for a day then your body gets used to it but it seems way more extreme with done/subs.  Now if i go to rehab they're gonna taper me with one of those and i'm just worried i'll never get off if i start.  FTR, yes i have severe chronic pain but it is curable with a lot of work/willpower/mind control thus why i'm worried about tapering.  If i knew 100% i was going to have to be a lifer, which i will be if i don't put in the work soon i think id have no hesitation with using done as my main med but that's not the case and if i'm going to go into recovery and start putting in work i dont want to switch on to a drug i cant get off.


So, what i'm looking for is accounts of people who have successfully tapered methadone/subs though probably prefer done because it seems to be a much better pain killer.  How was your taper?  How long were you on it for and what dose reduction/timeframe period did you do it under?  Did you have bad WDs every time you dropped a dose?  Did you have a month of acute WDs when you finally hopped off?  Thanks, i really need some guidance right now, this feels absolutely hopeless and my parents while supportive don't know what to do either really.  The hole is so fkn deep i can't see a way out right now i'm in such a dark place. Sigh",1544144097.0

Unknown to me my bookbag which held the deposits is wide open and basically D boy hops in the back of my car, serves me and leaves. 

When I got to the bank I realized my mistake and one of the deposits is missing. One that's $945... I have literally $7 to my name and don't get paid till Wednesday. I basically have till tomorrow to figure something out. My only thought was just use today's deposit to basically cover the one that got stolen and so on till I get paid Wednesday and can fix it myself. I've worked so hard to get in this position I am in now and I literally just want to jump out my window right now or run away. 

I'm not just messing with a mom and pop shop. We have LP to worry about. Basically the Golden rule is you have 7 days to drop a deposit before it gets turned to LP. The one that got stolen from me was the deposit on 12/30 so I have till tomorrow to drop it. The only thing I can see working for me is it'll be the weekend after that and LP wouldn't put a notice out till Monday morning. That basically gives me 3 days to figure something out.

Also this is going to be long, so sorry in advance.

So I've known this girl, we'll call her Sam, since I was 5.  I'm 28 now and shes 27.  We went to kindergarten together, then she moved to a private school but ended up being in my English class in 10th grade.  I remember seeing her walk in, being the ""new girl"" and honestly for me it was love at first sight.  She was and imo still is the most gorgeous creature I have ever laid eyes on.  And to top it off she has such a beautiful soul.  We dated briefly in highschool but I cut it off because I thought we would be better as friends.  However after a heartbreak I push people away. We didnt talk from age 17 to 21, where we reconnected. Started partying together etc etc but were never more than best friends.  And I mean best friends, we were together almost every day for 4 years.  Then right after my 25th birthday I decided to move out of state to get my mind right.  I was falling into addiction, not a specific drug but anything I could get my hands on.  The breaking point for me was when i got paid and was negative $900 in my account the same day.  I left for 4 months, went up to North Dakota, tiny town in the middle of nowhere.  I grew so much up there.  I learned who my real friends are.  Who were only faking to get a discount on all the drugs I had.  So I come back and me and her are hanging out every day, she starts dating this weed dealer that moves 40lbs a week and his house got raised then she was on the 24/7 sober program and had to get a UA done twice a day.  So friday she asked me of she could come hangout Saturday and if I could give her a ride to the jail at 9am, I said of course I would.  But I went and got so plastered that  night I could barely get out of bed. Said fuck it jail is only a few blocks from my house, let her take my car.  An hour goes by I call her she doesnt pick up. She called me 20 minutes later saying she got t boned by a cop that ran a red light because he had 2 people in custody in his back seat that were fighting and he was trying to get them to the jail asap. 

She broke her back in the accident.  Got put on Opana 80s 120 of them a month.  But then she turned 26 and got cut off from her moms health  insurance.  She started buying on the Street but it got too expensive. So she started  IVing the pills but her tolerance went up.  So she switched to heroin and fent just in an effort to save money.   She called me summer of last year.  We hadn't hung out in a long time, mainly because I got the feeling her boyfriend was jealous of me getting so much of her attention, and I didnt want to be that guy that got in the way.  They had eventually broken up. 

But she started staying over a lot.  Sleeping in my bed.  Hanging out 24/7, helping me hustle.  I fell in love with her.  More than I have with anyone. But then the cracks started to show. Eventually it came out that she was using heroin. She went to jail, twice.  Most of the last year actually.  But she reached out to me in July of this year, she had just gotten out after 6 months, is on probation, we hung out the entire weekend. 

I realized even after everything I still loved her, she had said she was clean, and she wasn't nodding out which was a plus. She had the soul of a lion I'd tell her.  But weekend came and went and I dropped her off at her moms in the and her mom called me to tell me she got arrested as soon as I dropped her off because of a probation violation.  So I put money on her books, went and visited her.  I told her I loved her every time I spoke with her. I thought hey maybe this time she will actually stay clean, I wished it so bad.

She got out 2 or 3 weeks ago.  And other than a couple days on the weekend, we hung out every day.  I didnt really think much of us not hanging out for a couple days I mean fuck I had her with me 5 or 6 days at a time.

Then about 12 days after she got out, she got deathly I'll.  She said she thinks she has a blood infection because she used to IV.  Tells me these things can take months to show symptoms which is actually true based on my research.  I took her to the hospital, she has endocarditis, although thankfully doesnt need surgery.  Shes in for 7 days and get out.  While she was in there she asked me to bring her kpins which I personally dont have a problem with just that shes in the fucking ICU fighting for her life.  Her mom tells me a couple days later that she admitted to her doctor that she shot meth the couple days we didnt hangout .  I got so mad that she lied to me,  not because she used, but that she lied.  I had found a needle in my shower 2 days before I took her to the hospital and she said it was old from before she went to jail, and she found it in her purse and was going to throw it away. All lies I'm guessing now.

Last night she got out of the hospital, yelled at me because her mom tore apart her room.  I didnt tell her why I had told her mom that, i wanted to wait until later that night.  She came over we hung out for about 45 minutes.  She got a phone call that she said this guy was going to come pick her up to swing a couple miles down the road to sell some of her xanax.  She told me she'd be gone for 30 minutes tops.  I knew it would be at least an hour since she had septic joints I knew she would be moving slow to begin with. 

I had messaged her in Facebook telling her to call me when she got back, so I could open the garage so that she wouldn't have to walk up my icy steps in her condition.  She wasn't active on Facebook for the whole 2 hours since she left.  I called her at 5 till 1am because I needed to go to bed.  She didnt pickup.  She was then active on Facebook literally after I hung up the phone.  I dont usually try to micromanage people but after everything she has put me through the past year and a half, even though I love the fuck out of her, I have problems trusting her.  But I basically blew up on her, told her she was being a swerve and she should have just told me shes not coming back.  She didnt text me back until 4am said she was out running hustles and had to be because she owed people money because her mom went through her room.

Like why the fuck not just be honest about that if that was the truth. While yes I want her to get clean,  I'm not going to judge her about her drug use.  I've smoked crack, I've done heroin.  Pills, molly you name it, I've done it all, I've just been fortunate enough to not fall into addiction to any of it, I always knew there was a line that was a giant cliff into a pitt that you could fall into, and I knew I didnt want to fall  into it.

I have other people in my life that are just friends, that are completely open about their addictions.  Mainly heroin addicts.  But she is the one I love.  And she is the only one that lies to me about it. It drives me crazy.

Like fuck man I feel so powerless. Like what can I do to help her.  What should I say to her to let her know its okay to be a fuck up. Like fuck man, my heart is bleeding over this

I had just gotten a new batch of H in, and did more than I usually do. I didn't feel too high, but after about an hour I noticed my hands were trembling a bit. I thought nothing of it, until about thirty minutes later my jaw started spasming uncontrollably.

I could not control my jaw. My teeth were clattering, my jaw was trembling, I couldn't talk and it would not stop. I was driving when this happened, and all of a sudden my leg started to have intense muscle spasms that were so bad that I could not keep the peddle down. This turned into about forty five minutes of my entire body just freaking out. I was jerking around because my jaw, legs, and most of my body was having crazy muscle contractions.

I got home safely, took some multivitamins, xananx, and drank some water and orange juice. It eventually stopped and I felt completely fine. I did some research and found that opioid abuse can cause something called myoclonus, which is what I just described.

Has anyone else had this happen? Should I be worried? It was by far the craziest thing that has happened to me.

Laughing, I replied 'What are you going to say next you've done it yourself'. He nodded, and explained that he had done heroin, during his 20s for around a year, no more than 25 times. He described himself as not addicted. I then asked what every-one who hasn't taken heroin must ask when confronted with such a situation, ""what does it feel like"". He replied with ""the most pleasurable feeling I've ever felt, like being wrapped up in a blanket, feeling safe"". Shocked, I could barely reply. I felt uneasy the rest of the evening, and a few weeks later, still feel a little uneasy each time I remember that moment. This unease, as expected, partly comes from the shock that a man who doesn't do any drugs, is actually rather boring haha, has done H. But most of all, it is the way he described it as the best. Is it truly the most pleasurable feeling? Can you get addicted after 20 hits over the course of a year?

&#x200B;

Whats more, I realise such narcism is deplorable, but is every feeling of happiness since taking the drug a lesser emotion in comparison? Does one spend the rest of their lives remembering H as the best feeling, and every other feeling of enjoyment is slightly greyer, slightly tarred, slightly less?

Okay, so, to sum it up, I've got a form of Marfan's Syndrome that has caused numerous problems, bone related and the like, and have recently undergone the second of two halves of a rare surgery where my ribcage needed reshaped. The first surgery I had to relearn how to walk, had to sleep sitting up, and did not return to ""base normal."" The second surgery left me significantly more normal, but has further disfigured my ribcage and left radiating pain further than before, including inflammation. Note: the surgery was initially done because my heart and lungs were being crushed to 20% operating capacity, and prior to the surgery I would've had only an additional 7-9 years left to live (I was 17 at the time, this was a few years ago, and second surgery was a week ago.) 

To the point: I have been to my doctor for a few various short term scripts in recent times, such as Adderall, an albuterol inhaler, and Valium (have stopped the Adderall as well as Valium.) My script for post-surgical Norco has run dry (roughly one tenth the amount that was given to me for the first surgery, understandable because of the vast differences but not enough in total) and tylenol and ibuprofen are not going to be enough in total, and alone, for dealing with the remaining ringing pain that is going to be present due to muscles, bone, and nerves having to be cut. Its irritating, mostly because I know a low-level painkiller would do the trick but is next to impossible to achieve due to the further regulating being done around opiates. I don't want to try to ask my doctor and seem like a ""drug seeker"" considering in the last month I've had two high-schedule drugs prescribed in the short term (valium for seizures, adderall for lack of concentration and thought process) of which they tried to pawn me off to a neuropsychlogist for the valium script (again, I went for seizures.) 

The question: What are the legal measures (if there even are any) to take if I were to drive to a town in Canada (I don't live all that far away in the U.S.,) purchase some Tylenol 3 (+ C) and bring it back to the U.S.? Are there permits or announcements I need to make to CBP?

Tl;Dr Rare surgery problems, painkillers bye bye, assistance in sourcing more legally but with barriers, what do?

Now the thing is that this man must also have the immune system of a horse cuz he has never gotten any sort of infection, not even once (granted he‚Äôs also never misse as he was blessed by the junky gods with them fatazz body builder veins) and he doesn‚Äôt even have a single visible track mark to speak of (even upon close inspection) though he always shoots in the same relative spot.

Finally, this brings me to why I am writting you guys today... Within the last week we‚Äôve come across a reputable supply of 2mg Xanex. Unfortunatly he called me last night and says he had an epiode like non he‚Äôs ever experienced before. Apparently he was just talking to his brother and all of a sudden just dropped to the floor mid-sentance. He‚Äôs also been complaining of a sensation of like his brain spinning around in his head but with his head remainjg completely motionless. SO... My question to you all, are these symptoms you all have ever heard of before and do they mean anything in particular? Do you guys collectively agree this warrents a visit to the Emergency Room/Hospital or at least a doctors visit?

After signing all of the required agreements to receive the RX (2 hours into the appointment) I was told that I could not get the Suboxone script due to the fact that I am prescribed Adderall (30mg 2X Daily) by my regular psychiatrist that I‚Äôve been seeing regularly since early 2004.  Now I wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect walking into this appointment this morning but I certainly would‚Äôve never guessed that my Adderall script would be the reason for being rejected a Suboxone script. 

The doctor explained how she felt Adderall was a ‚Äúvery dangerous drug‚Äù and refused to script Suboxone unless she would have the opportunity to consult with my psychiatrist AND I agreed to discontinue Adderall and be willing to try a different (non stimulant) drug. So again this came as a huge surprise to me and I figured if anything might present a problem (or reason for the Dr. to deny a Sub script) it would most certainly be Benzos or to a lesser extent my positive UA result for weed. I had received a 30 day script of Xanax (1mg) about 2 months ago from my regular psychiatrist which I had intended to use towards the end of my Suboxone taper. I still have that entire script sealed and locked away and I was forthcoming regarding it being prescribed, filled, and still in my possession.  I guess I just figured if anything that would be the issue to come up and prevent me from getting a new script for Sub. So I guess I just feel like this doctor was just looking for something (anything really) to get me out of there empty handed.

So I just figured I‚Äôd share in this Sub and maybe get some feedback and/or advice going forward. I‚Äôd love to hear what you guys think and specifically:

1) Is Adderall really a harmful/dangerous drug that presents a significant risk (and potentially harmful drug interaction) to the opiate dependent user? I‚Äôve been prescribed and using  regularly both Adderall & Suboxone for several years. If it did indeed present such a dangerous and risky drug interaction, why would my previous Sub doctor and psychiatrist allow me to continue on this combo? I don‚Äôt necessarily reject this doctor‚Äôs reasoning outright. Perhaps she‚Äôs right and it‚Äôs not the the safest combination of drugs but this is what‚Äôs been working for me and prescribed to me for years. 

In any event I just kind of feel like this doctor could‚Äôve saved us both a lot of time had they simply refused to prescribe Sub alongside Adderall. Why schedule me for the appointment,  have me submit the UA, paperwork, medical background/details, etc. etc. if you know from the jump you won‚Äôt script any patient using Adderall?

2)And I guess my more pressing concern is where do I go from here? I suppose I will just continue to seek out another Sub doctor (I have about 25-30 2mg strips remaining) however the doctor I met with today did give me a referral to an extremely expensive pain management specialist and suggested that I get in touch with that person to assist me with Suboxone maintenance and/or perhaps treating with a different opiate.  Anyway yeah sorry for the Adderall fueled rant/ramble!!!! Lol Thanks again everyone and hope you all are having  a relaxing and pleasant evening!!!",1544072734.0

I‚Äôd been hustling every day to support our habits and try and fend off the debt he was getting from payday advancements. I sold panties, all my things, and drove my dealers around just to keep us both right. At some point our relationship turned toxic. I‚Äôd been self medicating my crippling depression, and he just wanted to keep his high going. Arguments about the drugs happened often and I grew to resent him. He‚Äôd gaslight me and then turn sickly clingy, giving me whiplash. 

I started working for two dealers who lived together and were doing well, one I was friends with from previous business. One night after driving them around, they gave me china to try. Over the course of that night, he had stolen most of what I brought home. We fought and he told me I have no reason to be mad. I acted like he was right but started staying at my dealers house instead. I acted like I still loved him but I didn‚Äôt. Eventually I couldn‚Äôt keep up with bills and both our habits. He also had contacted my parents and told them I was the one solely doing drugs. My father ended up taking a bus and driving me home. During the drive I had brought much more than I was used to and almost died.

My ex claimed to do it because he was worried about me. Tried to tell my mom he had been wanting to get clean and I wouldn‚Äôt let him (after I quit numerous times and tried to help him and he refused). Tried to act like it was my fault they found out. He even threatened to sue me for wanting my cat back. I stopped speaking to him as I was going cold turkey. The last message I had was a month later when he said I owed him money for putting him into debt. I didn‚Äôt answer. 

He OD‚Äôd in January. I abandoned him. I knew I was his only friend. I knew he had his own issues and I didn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm mentally numb to the thought of his death but sometimes my heart hurts.

I‚Äôve been clean for over a year now. And I wish that he could‚Äôve gotten clean too.",1544045787.0

1. How did you get addicted? And how does your addiction affect your life?

2. What does it feel like to be on your drug of choice? 

3. How much does it typically cost?

4. How much work goes into acquiring it?

5. Do you think you would be capable of quitting if you focused all your time and energy into it?

6. And finally, if you could go back in time and stop yourself from trying it, would you?

Not only are we committing felonies so it's best not to be in the area longer than we need to but everyone else is fucking going through it too. The dude who spends 3 minutes talking to the dealer is always the one who is just salivating when he pulls ups. It's like all the withdrawal he was just in goes away as soon as he sees that car, and he just talks and talks. Almost like he's getting pleasure of making everyone else wait while he has what he needs.

I've also had this happen to me when I'm with someone who is a talker. They'll be jonesing like no tomorrow pawning off their last possessions, but they'll sit there and talk to the dealer after we're served instead of leaving right away to get right like we should be doing. 

Anyway, this just happened to me. Was meeting the dude, I was the first person there, but the third guy there jumped out of his car and ran over to the dealers car as soon as he pulled up and just stood outside dude's window talking BS with the shit in his hands, while he could see the rest of us waiting our turn. ughhh

I started taking opiates as a bet at a job. I had been drinking for awhile when this ""bet came about"". Weed and psychs was not my thing. I was bet that I could not get |x| amount of work done in what was the allotted time if I took one of (employees) meds. At this point I was ignorant, and laughed and said hell yea $10. The bet then went to 2 and I still said fine. I ended up taking ""had no reference at the time"" 2 30mg oxycodone (I know people will say no one would give this away, but at this time it was sooooo cheap and it was to make fun of me when it hit)

&#x200B;

   All of this was only irrelevant for about 15 minutes when I was working in a bay by myself. There are not words that can explain what happened over a maybe 2 or 3 minute period. I was concerned, amused, and then floored as far as emotions go. I felt absolutely invulnerable, I was alone in the bay for a good 45 minutes and was stuck with my thoughts about this while i was working. Saying that it was amazing is an understatement.

&#x200B;

I got my work done and went back to laugh at a joke meant to blow up in my face. Here is where I finished out the day and went home without much fanfare except for to tell the dude he did the exact opposite of what was intended (I have to interject here too and say that he may well have been smart to think hey, ""I cant totally hook this kid and it will be a cakewalk. But this guy blew me off for over 2 months after this....hell maybe it was a long play.""

&#x200B;

  Back to the day it all happened. I go home and swipe one of my dads beers from the basement and go put on some music to chill with because I am still feeling awesome +3 hours later. I drink maybe a 1/3 of the beer in one gulp and sit down. Not 5 minutes goes by and I am running for the bathroom to throw up. I was in zero pain but it was coming out...and I really could not have cared less. I was fine and my stomach was immediately settled. The rest of the night was cool and I just refrained from drinking and still felt pretty fuckin bulletproof for most of the night.

  A few months later and I end up asking this dude for pills because I am hungover as fuck and he gives me 1. I should have been afraid that I would throw up again but I guess I wasn't thinking. I was fine, The exact same thing happened as the first time! I was money the rest of the day. This is where things start to turn.

&#x200B;

   this was my first experience with opiates. I have not had them in about 17 months after over a decade of ""daily if possible"" usage.

Drove a good distance to meet my middleman, who I was planning on buying 7 30‚Äôs from. Ended up waiting for a long time in the parking lot like usual, but eventually she texted me saying she was coming with her boyfriend and to look for a black truck.

She said how she was in a hurry and whatnot so I was getting a little weird about the whole thing but I‚Äôve copped through her plenty of times and more or less was ready to just get home (which is 2 hours away, long I know, but I live out in the middle of nowhere so I‚Äôm used to it)

Around 9pm or so I see the truck pull up, and I step out of my car ready to jump in the backseat of the truck and finally cop. He pulls up with the window rolled down saying what‚Äôs up and that he has to go somewhere so we gotta make this quick. I literally could only think about the pills in his hands so I had my guard down and since I knew the girl I didn‚Äôt really think about it so I gave him the money and he gave me the pills which were wrapped up. I figured he would stay there for a sec to count the money and let me look at the pills but nope he just said bye and drove off

As soon as he left I realized what might of just happened and I ripped open the bag. Fucking vitamin B pills. Obviously I‚Äôm pretty upset but I mean shit happens so whatever. Drove home and had to explain to my gf where I had been.

Anyway, I know where they live, and now know what truck her bf drives. (First time id met him, I always just went through his gf)

Her bf has no idea I know where they live. I also know what day of the month she gets her 8mg a day Xanax script (that doc is crazy I know). 

I feel like I should just chalk this loss up and move on, but I feel betrayed and that was a good bit of money to lose. Plus I drove 2 fucking hours, and the week before I helped her out and gave her a ride to the dboy.

What do you guys l think I should do?

It‚Äôs embarrassing telling this story to me bc I feel like I should know better by now, but whatever I love this sub and read it all the time so I doubt y‚Äôall will judge me too harshly.

a3bv53,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a3bv53/gotta_love_the_justice_system/,10,https://redd.it/a3bv53,2ndwaveobserver,Gotta love the justice system,"So early last year, I got pulled over for not completing a stop at a stop sign. Small town cops look for any reason to stop people. The cop claims I‚Äôm drunk (which I wasn‚Äôt) and starts berating me for driving under the influence. In his mind, me being drunk also means I must have drugs on me for some reason so he proceeds to search without my permission. 

Eventually he finds an old straw that was used for snorting shit, which is old af because I haven‚Äôt snorted in a long time. Regardless though, there was some residue inside and he got all pumped up saying ‚Äúif there‚Äôs narcotics in this straw I‚Äôm sending it to the state‚Äù. Fucking pig. 

Well true to his word, a few months later I get a felony warrant for possession of heroin and fentanyl, all because of a tiny bit of residue that amounts to nothing more than paraphernalia. It‚Äôs total bullshit but I have to fight it. So I get a lawyer and pay him 3,500 bucks to fix this shit. 

After about a year of back and forth crap and several court dates later (which I didn‚Äôt have to attend) I get a call on Monday from my lawyer saying that the arresting officer no longer works at this department and they have no idea where he went. Which means there is no longer a case!! They‚Äôre banking on him obviously not showing up and getting a dismissal, but on the off chance he does show up, they‚Äôve already got a winning argument. His entire statement was centered around the fact that he believed me to be drunk but he never once did field sobriety test or gave me a breathalyzer, so his probable cause statement is null and void. Fucking idiot. I even asked him when he arrested me if he was going to test me and he got all pissed and got in my face cussing at me and what not. 

Only thing that sucks is, after all of this I never even needed a lawyer in the first place. The cop leaving the department is something that wouldn‚Äôt have costed me a dime. Oh well. No felony for me! ",1544013055.0

I started to dabble in drugs when I was 18. I did everything except meth  pretty much but opiates were always my DoC. I was deep into it (had people shoot me up a few times but knew better to learn to do it myself). Finally when I was 23, my mom pleaded to me to get clean. I had hit rock bottom. I was behind on rent, bills, my car got towed and impounded, almost lost my job, dropped out of school, etc. You know the drill. I voluntarily checked into a public detox center for 3 days and then moved back out into the country with my parents and was clean for over 6 years. 

Fast forward to summer 2017. I have a house, a car, a husband, 2 kids. Life is fine, but my goddamn anxiety was eating me up. I was offered 2 perks and told myself I deserved this. I could handle this. My brain just needed a break. 

It wasn‚Äôt one time. I was euphoric. So I kept getting more. It made me a better parent, after all, I told myself. But pills got more pricey and I wasn‚Äôt even getting high off them anymore. So the last 2 months I‚Äôve been snorting heroin. Now, my rock bottom, might not be your rock bottom. But after I nodded off in a hammock for 3 hours in 30 degree temps and when I nodded off into a bowl of soup at dinner (thankfully I was alone with no family that day) I realized I needed to change. 

I kept telling myself I‚Äôd get one more fix to help taper myself down and eliminate most WD symptoms. That went on for awhile. 

Finally, for some reason, my one and only plug didn‚Äôt respond one day. By that point I was in full blown withdrawal. I knew it was now or never. I first blocked and then deleted his number from my phone. I got all my shifts covered for 9 days. I started researching withdrawal symptoms and lurking on reddit. 

I had gone through all this before but it had been 6 years since I‚Äôve experienced this and knowing what to expect helped.

So, I was bed ridden for 3 days while my husband cared for our children. It was hell. Fever and chills, sweats, my dilated eyes HURT, eveything smelled so bad, restless legs, anxiety was eating me alive. I didn‚Äôt sleep for 3 days and on day 4 I slept for 2. I took 4 showers a day. I smoked copious amounts of weed to get through it (does it count as cold turkey then) and took valerian root. My GI issues and night sweats are still present but I feel much better.  I ordered some CBD Oil and it‚Äôs been a miracle for my PAWS symptoms, especially anxiety which is always my trigger. 

Now, I was doing drugs on my own. I didn‚Äôt have to cut any friends out of my life. I only had the one plug.  So, a bit easier for me in that regard. 

Anyway, I see a lot of people struggling in here and I just wanted to post my recovery story. I can‚Äôt deal with NA meetings because I have a mild case of agoraphobia and I don‚Äôt need to surround myself with people that have potential hook ups to new dealers. These online communities have helped me a lot, reaching out without physically doing so. Anyway, just want everyone to know that recovery is possible. It‚Äôs hard ass work but it‚Äôs worth it. 

If anyone needs support or just someone to talk to while beginning their journey into sobriety, I‚Äôm here for you.

I will always love opiates, but there‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúone last time.‚Äù ",1544010503.0

Discuss","Okay so I made a post yesterday about jumping off a fairly large morphine habit (300mg a day) and hopefully switching on to kratom. Well I'm currently at hour 21 since my last dose and have been taking 10grams of kratom every 4 hours and it's barely holding me. I'm currently going through bouts of hot and cold flashes, extreme fatigue, sweating, anxiety and dysphoria but I'm not quite in full wds so that kratom is def helping a little. 


Now I'm a chronic pain patient so the just sweat it out for a week to get my life back isn't an option because I need to work at the pain gradually reducing dosages of whatever pain meds while increasing healthy activities like exercise etc. Anyways I'm getting sicker by the hour, I have lots of morphine but I'm really trying not to use. (I know stupid to keep it around I just dont know if I'll need it til i can get to a doctor) So anyways I have a friend dropping in some subs to me tomorrow. I have about 10 days to get shot right before going back to work. By that time I have to be stable and I dont want to be stable on morphine/oxy because that shit is destroying me and my non existent money. 


So my options are as follows- I can grab my kratom and head up to the country to my dads and just sweat this out until I stabilize on kratom. I can take the subs and kratom together this addressing both the addiction ad pain element of my problem. In terms of what's going to be easiest and less pain as well as possibly what'll keep me off the harder stuff long term the combo seems like the go. But I'm terrified of becoming even more dependent on subs and then I still have to get off those down the track which seems like even more of a nightmare. I can get a script for subs that's np. I know everyone's different but what strat do you guys think my best ling term outlook is for this? Basically I need something for my pain and I need to somehow not use while also being able to slowly reduce dosages of whatever I'm on as I work to cure my chronic pain with as few debilitating side effects as possible. This is all new ground to me as i dont have much experience with kratom or subs though I'm well versed in opiates in general, so any advice is appreciated. ",1544005289.0

My Journey and Advice so Far:
Today I discharged from a recovery center for detox. I spent 5 days in there, where I was surrounded by medical care and others going through detox, whether it was for alcohol or drugs. THIS WAS THE BEST THING POSSIBLE!!!
During the day, I had group meetings and was given meds to ease withdrawal and basically stabilize me. This is NOT recovery, simply stabilization and that is where you need to START.

Tomorrow, I start my PHP (partial hospitalization program) where I go for 5 days a week, about 5 hours a day of group/one on one therapy, and this will be for about 4 weeks. I will also be going to NA meetings and following the 12 step program. If you think that program is bullshit, you‚Äôre wrong. Accept the fact you can‚Äôt change things on your own, and have the courage to change the things that you can. Serenity is where it‚Äôs at.

Basically, if you don‚Äôt know what to do, go detox at a recovery center and start from there. Best descision I‚Äôve ever made, don‚Äôt plan on EVER going back.

Injecting- Never done and don‚Äôt plan on it. Fuck needles. Fuck being wayy more addicting. Fuck having to stab yourself every time you‚Äôre trying to use.

It doesn't impact me terribly, but in essentially makes my hands shake/tremble, and it has gotten more pronounced as I get older. It's exacerbated if I haven't eaten, or if I take any stimulants (I'm prescribed Adderall for ADHD). Ironically, the shaking gets worse if I am concentrating and trying to keep my hands still to do something involving fine motor control.

As you can imagine, this can make hitting a vein absolute hell, and it's ridiculously hard to keep a needle steady in my vein and depress the plunger. Even worse, sometimes I shake when I get excited. You can't imagine how maddening it is to be sick as hell, make a bigass shot, poke around for 20 minutes, and then get so excited when I finally register that I accidentally jerk the needle straight out of my arm. I've also helplessly watched as my shaking hands spilled my dose all over the floor. I once diligently and responsibly managed to save a large wakeup shot I had spent 5 hours laying in bed thinking about, only to spill the entire thing on the carpet. The feeling of depression and self-loathing as I cried and tried to draw it up out of my dirty carpet still feels raw today.

There's no real point to this post, I just felt like whining, and this isn't really a problem I can talk about anywhere else, since the general public is remarkably unsympathetic in regards to my challenges with successfully injecting drugs into my veins.

On a side note, does anyone else get shaky when they're dopesick? I find that I shake like an alcoholic going through withdrawal when I'm detoxing, and that when I'm high/well it goes away. Am I alone, or is this a normal thing?

&#x200B;

However, as I went to mix up my first fix, I noticed that the dope dissolved REALLY differently than what this batch normally looked like. It dissolved much more quickly and more clearly, whereas normally this stuff is on the murky/thicker side.

&#x200B;

This spooked me, so I stopped short of my usualy dose a lot and did a tester. I got WAY high. Had a crazy rush.... easily the most intense rush/high I've had in a long time. There was definitely dope in there, but additionally, I'm certain there must have been another potent drug mixed into it. It honestly shook me and for a few minutes, I worried I might be spent (at this point I still thought it was just super powerful dope). Fortunately, I'm okay, many hours later.

&#x200B;

Symptoms of whatever it was cut with: my eyes dilated like crazy; to the point where I couldn't see very close up. Obviously not an opi symptom. The other thing is my jaw has been clenchy all night. Obviously from these symptoms, I'm convinced I slammed some sort of upper (which sucks because I really don't enjoy uppers at all), but I can't really think of what it might be. The powder was yknow.... slightly off-white/tanish powder... It dissolved 100% fully. Hard to know what it was specifically, but since I don't do a lot of uppers, I'm wondering if anyone here has any thoughts on what it might be.

Thus, Oxycontin is most likely VERY regulated, and VERY rare, and VERY frowned upon.... Although, are there generic brands that aren't widely known or may be less frequently shown in a bad light? 

&#x200B;

My local hospital will NOT give out ANY opiate... I understand why. Although, I personally found my way of managing the pain as well as avoiding a physical tolerance and addiction.... I tried Fentanyl on the street because I couldn't find a way to reduce the pain in my bound ankle joints through arthritis medication and ibuprofen lead brands.... I was physically addicted after 2 days of use.... I usually manage Oxycontin with 1/2 morning, 1/2 night, next day 1/2 afternoon.... skip day... and repeat. Fentanyl had me in opiate withdrawal before noon the next day of barely having taken it. Scary stuff, and I want the Oxycontin back. 

People are irresponsible, and weak to addiction. I know this, and have done research and personal studies and trials to find the right way to manage my pain using the best medications....

He‚Äôs been on Vicodin for shit idk probably like 7-8+ years. When we moved to a different state he quit getting his script and didn‚Äôt find a different doctor down here. So of course, I did what I do best, did some magical junkie shit and found the right people to get what I wanted after about a month and a half down here. He had snorted some of mine before when he ran out of his script just so he wouldn‚Äôt be sick. He even took them as prescribed dude; like 1-3 500‚Äôs a day. 

         Well, he eventually graduated to shooting because that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve done it for 9 years. I tried to explain to him that it‚Äôs different and he would fall in love and never fully recover but did he listen? Nope. It just makes me sad because we‚Äôre both awesome people we just have chemical dependencies that is putting a significant strain on our relationship. We agreed to quit about 3 weeks or so ago because it just got way too expensive. He went to a doctor and got prescribed Suboxone. I think the shit sucks fat dicks I‚Äôm Either getting high, or I‚Äôm not. Fuck that fake ass shit. 

       So I‚Äôve used about 4 times over these 3 weeks and have been researching the shit out of different supplements and what not and am going to try various things until I get where I need to be with my brain functionality because when I‚Äôm sober my brain is always like foggy feeling like my whole life is just one big, long ass cloudy, gloomy day that‚Äôs in black and white because the colors don‚Äôt even matter anymore. Existence is bland and I have absolutely no motivation ever so I have to figure out alternatives . That‚Äôs a summed up version of events haha. 

       Now here‚Äôs my real point; have any of you heard about or experienced Suboxone first hand causing someone you knew, or yourself, to just be blatantly, unforgivingly mean??? I noticed the change in his behavior/attitude towards me after about maybe only 1.5-2 weeks of taking them and it really is concerning me because he‚Äôs becoming someone that I don‚Äôt even want to get to know man for real. It is legit super fucking sketchy but I told him what I thought and how it‚Äôs changing him and he agreed and said he has already started tapering down. He‚Äôs prescribed 2 8mg strips a day and has been doing them at the same time I guess so he‚Äôs built his tolerance a decent amount in a short time. 

     Also, is he going to feel full blown withdrawals when he does eventually quit or will it just be mild WD/discomfort?  Oh and how long does sub Withdrawals usually last for? If you took the time to read this, thank you, and please leave your opinion down below I need as many answers as possible.

But anyways my habits been getting worse and I've kind of been at a loss as to how to get it under control. It's so hard when your habit is massive and you have chronic pain as well and you're stuck in the cycle of working full time to pay for your habit which you need to be able to work. Escaping that cycle just seems huge. So I asked my dad for help and went up and visited my dad and step mum and they're so supportive. If I wasn't so numb from morphine I'd probably be tearing up right now. Have put a plan in place to try a few different avenues to try and get my life back. 

We've floated a few diff options and the one that I'd most like to work is to switch from a mixture of tea and pharms to kratom. I'm unsure whether kratom will be enough to hold me or provide enough pain relief to allow me to function. That being said it would save me about $500 a fortnight thus allowing me to work less and focus on improving my health. I'm super grateful that I have such a supportive family but I'm still pretty worried about starting out. For those that have done the switch, if I need about 250-300mg of morphine a day to hold me, do you think kratom will hold me? I know it won't be totally smooth and I'll still have some WD symptoms especially fatigue for the first 3-7 days. But apart from fatigue what else should I expect? I have 4 diff strains of good kratom, only 1 red which sucks but if it works I'll order another kg of just reds. Have many chronic pain patients found relief in this switch? Or is my tolerance too high for this to work?

 Much love fam, if you're feeling as low as me don't be afraid to ask for help when you're ready, or feel free to vent here about whats going on in your life.

No. They start yelling at us because males and females aren't supposed to interact! I am yelling for help and this dickwad runs to get another counselor to get us in trouble. 

I get the girl to the cunt of a nurse and she goes to the hospital.  She had a bleeding ulcer and could have died. I think it was called peptic or peritonitis or something. 

Anyway, that was just typical of that fucking hellhole. Oh, and she got so sick because she wasn't getting her medication as she should.  This happened to other people, too. And then they blamed the people and said they refused their meds.

It's been decades but when I think about that place,  I still get so angry.

You‚Äôre probably thinking I‚Äôm the most gullible person on earth. You‚Äôre probably thinking he is some guy on the other side of the country fucking with me, only to later hit me with that ‚Äúokay I just need you to send me a gift card first.‚Äù Maybe you‚Äôre right, but I don‚Äôt think so. This guy seems super legit.
Okay, so I have money, but haven‚Äôt been able to get ahold of a plug for the past couple of days. Long story short, I‚Äôm sick. I have no dope but but I have $100 for a gram. A little above standard price for a gram of tar in my area. So I post on the opiates group on whisper a pic with my area code.
So.... about an hour later I get a message from a guy. It‚Äôs about 10:45 at night by the way. He tells me that he can help me and asks if I‚Äôm mobile. I tell him unfortunately  have no ride at the moment, and that it sucks because I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs in the way between him helping me. He asks where I am and I send him the addy to my complex. He tells me that he was gonna see if I could meet him close to the dboys place and we could figure it out in person, but that since I have no car we can‚Äôt do that.
Darn I‚Äôm thinking, this could be legit and it won‚Äôt work because I have no ride right now. He then surprises me by telling me that I live only about 15 minutes from him, but that he has to drive downtown to pick up. He tells me that he doesn‚Äôt have the extra money to buy me a g, but that he could come by and sell me a few points to hold me over for the night and that maybe tomorrow we could go and do a real pickup. 
I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with whisper, but to me this guy sounds legit. He talks casual, knows the area really well, and is willing to meet in person, here at my apartment nonetheless!
So, I bet you think this is a major scam and I‚Äôm just too stupid to see. Maybe you‚Äôre right. Either way, right now I am waiting to see if he actually comes through because he is pretty much my last hope.
If he does pull through, then this was a major win. I got help on a sick night and I found a new friend to go pick up with in the near future. Worst case he turns out to be a scammer and asks me for a gift card or bitcoin just like everyone else. Or he shows up and takes my money. Either way, he‚Äôs my last choice and I have hope. I‚Äôll be for sure to let you guys know how it goes!

EDIT 1: He just told me he‚Äôll be here in 20 minutes and asked if I have a scale. Fingers crossed, man!

EDIT 2: YOU GUYS ARENT GONNA BELIEVE IT! He really came through!!!! I was surprised as hell when I saw him in the parking lot. Went out to his truck to meet him. Got in to a super chill, laid back dude who legitimately helped a fellow junkie in need. He was gonna sell me a .4 for 30! Which I didn‚Äôt expect at all but I only had 20s. I was gonna tell him that I could give just take .3 for 20 instead, but he suggested giving me a .55 for 40 instead! He was the real deal! Even gave me a little extra! We exchanged info and are going on a real pickup tomorrow. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED GUYS! I‚Äôm beyond relieved. Finna go shoot me the most relieving shot on earth!",1543901806.0

Well, my question is - you know you need at least 91% Isopropyl Alcohol to extract the oxymorphone out which is absolutely no problem to buy anywhere ($2.50 at Wal-Marx for the big ass bottle) ‚Ä¶. But what do you guys think about this...? What if I got online and ordered from a chemical supply company 99% STRENGTH ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL instead of 91% ‚Ä¶ Do you think this much more pure alcohol would result in better extraction?

I'm extremely curious as to what effects this super pure Isopropyl Alcohol would have on the end result... I don't wanna waste a pill or money or fuck myself up experimenting.. but I really DONT see anything but UPSIDE to using a stronger Isopropyl Alcohol.

1) Why does the process for extracting opiates involve specifically cold water? I‚Äôve actually seen some guides that suggest different temperatures of water.
Are hydrocodone / oxycodone (etc) only soluble in cold water? Or does it have something to do with the acetaminophen?

2) I‚Äôve read that it‚Äôs best to only use a small amount of pills (Vicodin for example) when cold water extracting. Is this true? I read 5, but that‚Äôs super vague. It didn‚Äôt imply how many mg of hydrocodone.

I cant handle the burden of addiction anymore. I cant afford my habit with my tolerance, and I cant keep selling to make enough to feed it, because I dont have enough time for everything in life anymore. I'm barely making it through college. I dont have time between work and hustling to get my assignments done, so I wanna stop hustling, but I cant afford to feed my habit without it. I dont have the time to quit cold turkey. I want to keep my life together as much as possible, that's the whole reason why I want to be done with this dependance. If I quit cold turkey I wont be able to work or go to school, which would negate the reason for stopping in the first place.
   I need suggestions on the best way to stop without being completely useless. I can get my hands on some suboxone. Is it possible to use subs for 3 or so days to avoid the worst of the withdrawl phases without just withdrawling just as bad when I stop taking subs? Should I taper off dope without subs? Should I taper off dope, then taper off subs? Or could I taper down my dope intake, then use just enough suboxone to stay well enough to function for 3 or so days, then just stop taking it and not be completely fucked? 
   I appreciate everyone's suggestions in advance. I just want my life back without losing everything in the process. If it comes down to it I'll give up everything to end my addiction, but I'd like to try to stop and still keep my job and pass my classes if at all possible.",1543863616.0

Prior to a pretty rapid taper, I Was consuming 30-50 x 30mg oxy‚Äôs daily. A‚Äôs V‚Äôs M -Boxes,you name it. Stabilizing on 20 a day was my first goal. 

 Day 1: Today 4/30/2016 is the day before launch and my stomach is in knots. Have not any oxy in days but continue immodium as needed. 

Using the addys & coco (Not recommended) has been helpful in symptom reduction especially regarding energy levels. I fear I have aggressively pursued this route to kick start this whole quitting; and to escape this disaster I find myself inhabiting.

Comfort Zone: ""When you keep too comfortable, discomfort has a way of finding you""

Reduction & Results have been encouraging but this is just Round 1 of at least a 3-6 round fight. I just hope I can pay this seductive lil pill‚Äôs price without enduring harm to me or any of my fellow travelers. 

An Upcoming Trip to Asia I dreaded-
I have prayed to Buddha today for his mercy in delivering both my Dad & I safely to blank‚Äôs wedding reception and then delivers us safely back home. I have few offerings for Buddha, but in earnest i put a half roxy at his feet as tribute to his knowledge & wisdom of this divine universe. I promise to avoid hurting any other creature be it animal or human on my journey. I pray I will discover the will of Buddha and proceed on our journey in a manner that pleases her.

Feelings: coming back rough & tumble. Twice began crying from painful thoughts of the past that I will need to face with pride as I walk this road. I hope that I am not too much of a burden on my Dad as the experience seems to vary in both timing & severity. I hope he knows how much I love him. I feel like such a tremendous failure the weight of the thought is remarkably light when I expected heavy. 

4/30/16@23:01: I have to keep reminding myself to stay on track because if I stop paying attention I will find myself advancing thru various abuse rituals or abuse itself. 

This rapidly approaching ""change of scenery"" may help with these autonomous abuse episodes but I pray for strength to endure what must inevitably be conquered. The stage is set for a motivational route backed by best friends & best family, but to deny the possibility of an alternative result would be to put myself at the hazard of a seductive and merciless drug that grows like moss and flourishes on cracks in one's resolve. Now is the time to batt down the hatches and come out swinging.

But behind the walls of my own mind I genuinely don't remember the path I descended, but its proving to be a hell of a climb out of it. I sit here with the capability to out think but some disconnect between commands and execution. I have often wondered if opiates had the most devious reproductive cycle of any known creature, this thought merits exploration. But Behold: The Bounty of a New Day

11:14...watching Brief History of Time and amazed how Stephen Hawkins resolved to do the best that he could in the face of one of the most debilitating diseases. There's an undercurrent of destiny, but regardless there's a lesson here for me. The house is in shambles and I need to give it a proper once over prior to Noon tomorrow. I have feverishly concluded that this home must be changed as I must change myself...its current state of affairs is a devestating indictment of its innkeeper that will be remedied.

Do addictions have an event horizon? No, but I continue to curse this tribe's silent despair.

11:34 A glaring oversight has been my lack of even the faintest mention of the imperative task of resource management. You know what they say, manage the resources or they will manage you which is considerably less pleasant.


5/1/16
MAYDAYMAYDAYMAYDAY 
The irony of the date seems like an appropriate headline for the change afoot. I have great faith in our safe passage, but its my soul that has been put at hazard.

The seductive element of this thing is the comfort that a new found sense of emboldened apathy can bring. But its too good to be true, and of course it is. The feelings are not deflected, far worse, they are archived for future horror show screenings.

The chain of events that made me really kick into high gear my desire not to feel is a family matter that has sent me to an abyss and rocked the foundations of my ego. The problem is, that by creating more problems I give this thing more power to do damage...and it truly has.

I don't cut myself much slack on the truth of my current situation, but I say that this trouble has infected my thought threatens to sink the vessel of my being like woodrot on a cutter.

The ability to take swift, decisive, and direct action...has been challenging. Enough of this for now, I need to make some moves

But on the practical side of things, I am pretty sure I have not eaten since Friday. Thats 2 days without food.
Of course being obese is a heavier problem when you aren't too stoned to care. Well guess what? I started caring about that almost immediately. And a visual testament to progress can be a great incentive when properly marshaled. Let me tell you, It's the Wild West in my mind with shootouts taking place between my synapses what feels like around the clock.
But I look awful, best to keep some distance from self inspection until such an endeavor might at least offer the hope of sone glimpse of the attractive person that fat people still think other people see them as. That person is still there, and he's mad as hell and wants some action 

Things have been so strained, distance simply kept us numb to old wounds. Whatever mistakes he may have made, and I openly realize how easy it is to judge from sidelines that are blurs at best in my own memory.  I never saw it coming, it's as though into the well I fell and then started demanding to know who had turned off the lights. I HAD FALLEN TOO
some of the deadliest traps are the ones that look so pedestrian. 

Addiction and pain are so deeply intertwined that your body does not know where one stops and the other begins. This is the razors edge, the place we dwell too long to find our fate.

A lil background:

My end argument is  this: I would rather be on codeine then, at least get some fake happiness then suffer with the awful metal torment I go through daily , and I no a lot of people that drink daily / smoke weed so is it really that bad compared to drinking every night ?

Ok so whilst I'm new to this subreddit I have been fully aware of the dangers off addiction and the dangers of opiates. I  would never take heroin . I admit I do have a addictive trait  but I managed to quit smoking, drinking, smoking weed.

I  just don't see the harm is using a 2/3 times a week since codine has a base celling of 400mg its not like it could be abused since you cant redose

Maybe deep down I no its  bad road to go down, But  with having major depression/panic and aniexty  I never feel at ease or happiness. where as when I take a good old dose 300 mg coz I have a high tolerance ( only used 3 times).

&#x200B;

 I have read a lot of peoples comments and they 80 % of them say you will get sucked in, whilst the other 20% say they can use a couple times a week and not get addicted.

&#x200B;

Plus where  I live its impossible to get oxy/  morphine  ( the stronger types of opiates) So I have to order codeine online from uk pharmacy's ( its legal to get codeine/ hydrocodeine online) So its not like I could  or would switch on to ""harder opiates"".

&#x200B;

My end argument is  this: I would rather be on codeine then, at least get some fake happiness then be sober and suffer with the awful metal torment I go through daily , and I no a lot of people that drink daily / smoke weed so is it really that bad compared to drinking every night ?  I no this is probably a weak argument but im just at wits end with feeling like this and I just want something to chill my overactive mind  out, is that such a bad thing?

It is literally the only drug i do. I hate alcohol, i hate weed, and I dont touch any other drug. If i quit codeine then i have nothing

My parents & my doctor want me to go to rehab, and start naltrexone (an opiod blocker medication) just because I use codeine.

Even my doctor said she'd prefer I get shitfaced drunk than use a little codeine. Why is it ok to get wasted off ethanol but not codeine? Alcohol is 10x worse in my opinion. Can someone give me advice.",1543841029.0

Anyone with decent knowledge about general prescription opioid meds?,"So over the last year I have been touching base with Codeine(/Paracetamol), Tramadol and Oxycodone(/Naloxone).

My ""default setting"" have been taking:
4 x 30mg Codeine/500mg Paracetamol three times pr. day. I started with maybe 2-4 pills pr day, and after a couple of months I was on 12 pills pr day(360mg), and I realised that paracetamol was going to become a issue for the liver (in addition to the constipation). I started taking 3-5 x 50mg Tramadol 2-3 times pr day (300-750mg).

Now I have swapped over to 4-6 x Targin  (10mg Oxycodone/5mg Naloxone, Extended release 12 hour, so total 40-60mg Oxycodone/20-30mg Naloxone) in the morning. I feel like I have more control over my life on this, although the goal is to decrease the use. I have 10mg Diazepam in case I need it, but try to avoid it, as I really was already tapered off benzo, and not too eager on getting back the brain zaps, fear of seizure etc.

How fucked up would you say I am? I'm currently on welfare after having been through ECT(electro convulsive therapy), and daily goal is going for a hours walk, but realistically it's more like every other day. Even though I have gone from impulsive 12 pills of codeine/Paracetamol pr day to now the Targin one time pr day, i don't really know in which direction I'm going, and how to get completely off.

I know this is not a thread for recovery, but it's more about getting some control for me atm. Hope mods will allow it, and I can get some tips and pointers on how deep into the shit I am, and how I can get some control and maybe even off it all. ",1543827392.0

Wall of text - spilling thoughts about my usage since I started.,"Hey r/opiates, I'm a #3 smoker from the UK who went on a approx 3.5g bender over the last week and a half, and am starting at least a month long break to try and reset my tolerance. Towards the end of when I had my stash, I was using smaller and smaller amounts just to make sure WDs would start a bit later on, and am now on kratom dosing twice feeling very little symptoms (thankfully my habit is comparatively small enough that it helps) except for a slight runny nose and constant mood swings. The main thing is the mental cravings for some more h, and it's rly difficult to not browse the onions for another gram for mid next week. I've been using very regularly since about may, with a long break over summer while staying with the fam. 

My biggest problem is that I don't actually get properly high anymore - at the most I get a strong nod and get some lovely peaceful sleep, but that feeling I'm chasing from back when I first started, that truly peaceful warm feeling I could get from snorting 0.1g, nodding watching youtube vids, eating a frozen pizza and a pint of ben and jerrys almost every night - hasn't accompanied getting high for a while now. I'm thinking it's either my permanent tolerance has built up too much and I'm past the point of ever getting high like that again (save for shooting which is an absolute no go), or I just need to take a longer break and wait for better dope to hit the markets (many reports of it all being cut to shit for a while now). 

I'm gonna try for as long a break as possible now, and hopefully when I come back I can at least feel something like it was when I first started. Anyone with more experience, especially when it comes to smoking and #3, able to chip in? Right now I have to smoke half a gram which is genuinely difficult, and I get a shitty high with a nod but almost nothing else.

I was looking to get back onto suboxone soon, and as a way of easing the transition onto subs (from currently taking oxy) I thought of stopping oxy, then taking some kratom as a way to manage the w/d over the course of 24-36 hours until the oxy has cleared, then take the suboxone (starting with 1mg, wait a little take more, etc)

Does anyone know if this can be done or will even the kratom cause precipitated withdrawal like oxy would? Basically I'm just trying to get off oxy and onto subs and be able to make the withdrawals more manageable during the waiting period after my last dose of oxy.

a2j5yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a2j5yg/narcan_pricing/,18,https://redd.it/a2j5yg,Connokofang,Narcan Pricing,"So I just wanted to ask other users what they pay for a narcan kit at the pharmacy. Where I'am at they give them out free with 3 0.5ml vials of naxalone, a breathing mask, 2 syringes and a carrying kit you can fasten to a belt. 

The reason I wanted to ask is I've heard in some places the price for one is over 100$. This seems a little exorbitant to me considering the intended end user of this kit isn't going to have the money or resources to buy one of these instead of buying their DOC. I mean if places heavily hit by this so called opiate epidemic make narcan more accessible and less costly or preferably free for addicts the overdose rate would significantly go down. 

Are there at least programs in place to subsidize the narcan so people don't have to pay so much at pharmacies? This almost makes me want to stock up on kits since I can source them for free and provide them to those that have to pay and cannot afford one. Difficult to do so though since I imagine shipping narcan has illegality issues especially if it had to cross a border/customs. Just kind of bothers me considering on the DNM/onion fields the other day I actually saw a narcan kit for sale for 60$ and it was the exact same kit I get....means there is even an illicit market for naxalone which just shouldn't be the case. Not surprising though. ",1543797010.0

‚ÄôCause laying back and getting high was all he cared to do.
As a kid, he sat in the cellar, sniffing airplane glue.
And then he smoked banana peels ‚Äì‚Äì which was then the thing to do.
He tried aspirin in Coca‚ÄìCola, breathed helium on the sly,
And his life was just one endless search to find that perfect high.

But grass just made him want to lay back and eat chocolate‚Äìchip pizza all night,
And the great things he wrote while he was stoned looked like shit in the morning light.
Speed just made him rap all day, and reds just laid him back,
the Cocaine Rose was sweet to his nose, but the price nearly broke his back.

He tried PCP and THC, but they didn‚Äôt quite do the trick,
and poppers nearly blew his heart and mushrooms made him sick.
Acid made him see the light, but he couldn‚Äôt remember it long.
Hashish was just a little too weak, and smack was a lot too strong,
 Quaaludes made him stumble, and booze just made him cry,
Till he heard of a cat named Baba Fats who knew of the perfect high.

Now, Baba Fats was a hermit cat who lived up in Nepal,
High on a craggy mountaintop, up a sheer and icy wall.
""But hell,"" says Roy, ""I‚Äôm a healthy boy, and I‚Äôll crawl or climb or fly,
But I‚Äôll find that guru who‚Äôll give me the clue as to what‚Äôs the perfect high.""
So out and off goes Gimmesome Roy to the land that knows no time,
Up a trail no man could conquer to a cliff no man could climb.
For fourteen years he tries that cliff, then back down again he slides
Then sits ‚Äì‚Äì and cries ‚Äì‚Äì and climbs again, pursuing the perfect high.
He‚Äôs grinding his teeth, he‚Äôs coughing blood, he‚Äôs aching and shaking and weak,
As starving and sore and bleeding and tore, he reaches the mountain peak.
And his eyes blink red like a snow‚Äìblind wolf, and he snarls the snarl of a rat,
As there in perfect repose and wearing no clothes ‚Äì‚Äì sits the godlike Baba Fats.

""What‚Äôs happening, Fats?"" says Roy with joy, ""I‚Äôve come to state my biz.
I hear you‚Äôre hip to the perfect trip. Please tell me what it is.
For you can see,"" says Roy to he, ""that I‚Äôm about to die,
So for my last ride, Fats, how can I achieve the perfect high?""
""Well, dog my cats!"" says Baba Fats. ""here‚Äôs one more burnt‚Äìout soul,
Who‚Äôs looking for some alchemist to turn his trip to gold.
But you won‚Äôt find it in no dealer‚Äôs stash, or on no druggist‚Äôs shelf.
Son, if you would seek the perfect high ‚Äì‚Äì find it in yourself.""

""Why, you jive motherfucker!"" screamed Gimmesome Roy, ""I‚Äôve climbed through rain and sleet,
I‚Äôve lost three fingers off my hands and four toes off my feet!
I‚Äôve braved the lair of the polar bear and tasted the maggot‚Äôs kiss.
Now, you tell me the high is in myself. What kind of shit is this?
My ears ‚Äôfore they froze off,"" says Roy, ""had heard all kind of crap,
But I didn‚Äôt climb for fourteen years to listen to that sophomore rap.
And I didn‚Äôt crawl up here to hear that the high is on the natch,
So you tell me where the real stuff is or I‚Äôll kill your guru ass!""

""Ok, OK,"" says Baba Fats, ""you‚Äôre forcing it out of me.
There is a land beyond the sun that‚Äôs known as Zaboli.
A wretched land of stone and sand where snakes and buzzards scream,
And in this devil‚Äôs garden blooms the mystic Tzu‚ÄìTzu tree.
And every ten years it blooms one flower as white as the Key West sky,
And he who eats of the Tzu‚ÄìTzu flower will know the perfect high.
For the rush comes on like a tidal wave and it hits like the blazing sun.
And the high, it lasts a lifetime and the down don‚Äôt ever come.
But the Zaboli land is ruled by a giant who stands twelve cubits high.
With eyes of red in his hundred heads, he waits for the passers‚Äìby.
And you must slay the red‚Äìeyed giant, and swim the River of Slime,
Where the mucous beasts, they wait to feast on those who journey by.
And if you survive the giant and the beasts and swim that slimy sea,
There‚Äôs a blood‚Äìdrinking witch who sharpens her teeth as she guards that Tzu‚ÄìTzu tree.""
""To hell with your witches and giants,"" laughs Roy. ""To hell with the beasts of the sea.
As long as the Tzu‚ÄìTzu flower blooms, some hope still blooms for me.""
And with tears of joy in his snow‚Äìblind eye, Roy hands the guru a five,
Then back down the icy mountain he crawls, pursuing that perfect high.

""Well, that is that,"" says Baba Fats, sitting back down on his stone,
Facing another thousand years of talking to God alone.
""It seems, Lord"", says Fats, ""it‚Äôs always the same, old men or bright‚Äìeyed youth,
It‚Äôs always easier to sell them some shit than it is to tell them the truth.""",1543788926.0

My family jumped shipped a long time ago. But it was okay because I still had my gf. And even though she doesnt use, she has stuck by me for a long time. I never thought that she too would abandon me. But she has now.

Part of me understands, part of me doesnt. I mean, I wasn't stealing from people, or lying and cheating about my addiction. I work a full time job and support my habit that way. Our rent and bills are paid. I fixed up away and out of sight. I cant understand why she left me a few days ago. And I am utterly depressed. 

She didnt even give me the courtesy of talking to me about it. She called me Wednesday night and said that we are going to be taking a break and then blocked me on all forms of communication. She went radio silent on me and that shit hurts. I would have thought years of love and dedication would earn me at least a conversation about it, but I guess I'm wrong. 

I am so hurt and heartbroken that I cant even cry. I'm empty right now. I can only hope that maybe she unblocks me and calls me to at least give me some closure. But the fact I'm completely blocked tells me she wont. She's done. 

Heroin has officially taken everything from me and left me with nothing but myself. I wish it could take me from myself sometimes. I'm thinking a out quitting again. But I cant leave my job for 30 days to go to inpatient. I've already done that twice before in the time I've worked there so if I ask for that much time off again, my bosses will know I'm using again and I cant see them keeping me around a third time. At most I could probably take a week off and go into detox, but I will have to wait until after the holiday season is over. 

Yeah, I think I'll try to get a week off work towards the end of January to go into detox and get off this shit yet again. 

Fuck, I miss her so terribly bad right now. I can only hope she comes back, even though I know deep down she wont.

So anyway, I've been using opiates for around a year give or take. Started with dihydrocodeine (sourced through onions) and then codeine which was more locally available at the time. Long story short I progressed to using heroin inhabitually. It was nice, and it quenched my curiosity for the not so varying effects of the natural opiate family- considering that they're all metabolised into morphine eventually. So far I've managed to avoid becoming dependent, and haven't thought I came close to being so at any point. The only thing I've taken daily was kratom in 2-3 weeks intervals and I suffered little to no withdrawals after stopping CT. Now for the current situation- due to circumstance (drug testing regularly) and my curiosity for semi-synthetics, I've acquired a rather large amount of oxycodone for someone with no tolerance (850mg). I haven't struggled with being able to put down my opies before, it's just I've never had this much of something at one time.

Also correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe if it is an opiate it has to be oxycodone. I broke off a piece of the pill and put it in a drug test cup w/water and mixed it around. It came back negative for opiates, but the drug test doesn't cover oxycodone. ",1543779535.0

I'm sorry to be posting this in r/opiates but my roommate uses all of my popular subreddits and i don't want him reading this. I know he won't be here lol.  

&#x200B;

So we're both gay. I have suspected him having a crush on me for quite some time but it  was ok as long as he didn't bring it up or anything. I won't go into specifics but he's been creeping me out for the past couple months and I've really distanced myself from him. This ""distancing"" really hurts his feelings and he's been bugging me with ""are you mad at me?"" blah blah blah for months. Well recently he found out why I have been distancing myself and it pissed him off. We talked on the phone and I told him I wasn't into him and never would be. I thought things were cool. He writes me a long letter explaining he wants to have an ""intimate"" friendship with me where I am not so distant all the time. Understandable. But then at the end of the note he says, ""would you ever be open to cuddling or me being a sugar daddy kind of thing?"" Reading that creeped me the fuck out especially since we talked on the phone and I made it CLEAR I didn't want anything to do with that. I'm almost postive he's a little autistic because he doesn't understand social cues at all. He doesn't understand that if he wants me to be his normal friend, he can't ask creepy shit like that and expect me to be cool about it. It seems no matter how I blunt i am, it doesn't get through to him. He stays persistent with his ""crush."" He would never act on any of these thoughts so I am safe. But it is incredibly awkward. I wish this kid could just be cool. We all have thoughts in our head but you dont have to voice all of those thoughts. 

&#x200B;

So now I'm all creeped out and don't know what to do. We have 9 months left on our lease. Part of me feels bad for him because he's autistic and just doesn't get it.

But say you take a nice big dose of your favourite opiates (codeine)once/twice in a week ,would you for the next few days suffer with withdraw symptoms?

Obviously if you have  big dose of alcohol you would be hangover next day and maybe suffer with depressive like symptoms for a few days after. Where as u could smoke lots of weed and been fine next day

I guess what im asking is do you have any tips not to get addicted..
As i do suffer with underlying depression / anxiety, i wouldn't want to make it worse, but when i do opiates that one of the only times i feel at ease or in a blissful state..

Currently , I've been on a Suboxone program for about a year now . I was able to cut down my dose to 4mg . A few months ago I was craving and fiending really bad so I hit up an old connect and he came to my house and brought me some dope . He says to me ""you're gonna love this shit "" and leaves . I go up to my room to prepare everything . Mind you it's been about 20+ hours since I've done the suboxone . I inject my shot. I kinda felt little light headed, but no rush. Immediately it vanishes. I start feeling chills all over my body and immediately start vomiting over and over and over. I curl up in my blanket and it went on for about 12 hours until it was over. 

I was under the impression that precipitated withdrawals usually happened when you were on an opiate and then took suboxone too soon , not the opposite ? There were times before when I've done this and I just wouldn't get high , but I never would experience withdrawals. 

Does anyone have any suggestions??",1543760423.0

So I sitting on the toilet in my bathroom getting my last shot for the day ready. I had about 2.5-3 pts left so I threw it all in my spoon and cooked it down but I realized I had forgot to get a cotton. The cottons are on the bathroom countertop just out of reach, so I carefully set my spoon down a little bit in front of my feet, which happens to be on a rug, but as I go to stand up somehow my foot got caught on the rug and gave it a big yank and of  course I look down to see my spoon flipped completely over.. What the fuck do I do now? The last bit of my H is a little stain spot on the rug in my bathroom. üò∞ü§ß
