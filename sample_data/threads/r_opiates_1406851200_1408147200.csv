AMA (Ask me ANYTHING)","A lot of Redditors of our subreddit asked me to keep updating about the situation in my contry re: opiates and benzos, especially combined with the fact that our country is bankrupt.

If you remember from my previous posts, Heroin #3 has a very reasonably price (10$-15$ per gram) or if you buy it through a middleman, 30$-35$. However, due to the economical crisis, the quality has dropped significantly.

I used to need 10-20 dollars per day to -not being just not sick but also feeling good- but the recent drop of quality made me spent -or must spend- 40-60$ per day. Some days, even 60$. As you can imagine, I cannot afford that since I am unemployed and my family gives me an weekly allowance. The aforementioned situation has pushed me to drop my tolerance so that I can be well without having to spend much money.

**Social/Ethical changes**

1. Even more snitching. 

2. Cops seized a very large quantity of Heroin #4, which would be the FIRST time in Greece that we would have this kind of H (circulating a lot), and there are rumors that they are going to circulate it on the market very soon. The ethical dilemma? Should I buy H #4 of a 80% purity and be very well, knowing however  that it comes from cops on top of the pyramid, or keep buying from the Roma, which hate cops and have shot and killed them on occasions, are very good-spirited, but have mediocre #3?

3. People now rely heavily on benzos, even more than the past. This results to kleptomania, being dangerous to themselves, etc. People like me, who use benzos for years and we are very addicted is a whole different story than people who JUST started combining *FLUNITRAZEPAM* for heaven's sake combined with H. Enter the OD's.

4. I mentioned in another post, but Meth is *on the rise*. It is ridiculously cheap (with 5$ you can spend 2 days on a low tolerance), and a lot of junkies need something new to have a nice buzz, since H has dropped in quality. The result? *Deaths, manias, psychotic episodes*, you know the deal.

5. The police during 2005-2009 had 'given' us a street (the 'tolerance' policy) so that we could buy, sell, use H being almost invisible. Now, they don't let an open market to form, and everyone works through telephones, a fact that makes dealers have a lower quality of work because they cannot meet new clients.

6. People started banging their H, because they want to achieve best results with fewer money. This will lead them to a downward spiral. I am guilty -kinda- because in my 10 year 'career' with H and benzos I have only banged 7-10 times. I am extremely afraid of it, and that saved me. I have fears of having a limb of mine cut, heart infections, etc etc.

Looking for some info on this drug.,"So I have been taking around 6 or 8 hydro 10/325s a day for several months prior to and then after having back surgery. I have been trying for a while now to get switched to Oxys, but my doc doesn't want to do that. So, today he wrote me some Talwin. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentazocine

I know I have a dependency on the hydro at this point, so I am nervous about taking this. Will it send me immediately into withdrawal? Has anyone tried this before? I am worried that it will make me dope sick right away. I never shoot, though. I always just eat my hydro. It has Nalaxone, too....which makes me wonder if it is something I ought to just stash away somewhere in case my scrips go away and then maybe I could use it to treat the WD symptoms then. Has anyone had any real, first hand experience with this stuff?  I am a bit leery.

Also, how exactly do agonists and antagonists work...is there anyone who could give me an ELI5 version of that?

Before that I was successfully chipping with hydrocodone for about, my normal dose was 30-60mg and I would normally take it 1 to 2 times a week.  I know it's ""bad"" but I suffer from pretty bad depression and opiates give me something to look forward too, even if Im in a shitty situation I can mentally make myself ok with it when I think about my opiate reward at the end of the week.  Honestly my biggest problem with opiates is that they are illegal and that I have to do ""shady"" things to get them.  Not to sound cocky or anything but I am pretty confident that I can keep chipping, im not a fan of doing opiates multiple days in a row and I like to keep my use to about once a week as I feel that I can still keep the ""magic"" this way.  I just wish I could get a prescription for 100mg of hydrocodone a month, I would be set, no worries...  Anyways after a month and a half without any connect, I finally stumbled upon some tylenol 3's.  I used the conversion tool and found that 30mg of hydro ~ 200mg of codeine.  Doing some research I saw that benadryl, which I normally take with hydro is not good to take withe codeine as it inhibits the enzyme that converts it into morphine, does anybody have any experience with this?  I was also curious about grapefruit juice as well as promethazine, I only have 50mg of promethazine and I would rather save it unless the benadryl doesnt work.  My final question is whether you think a month and a half is enough time to bring my tolerance back down to around my baseline which was between 20-30mg of hydro.  Im considering starting at 150mg of codeine and going up from there as I remember I got some prescription free codeine when I was in south america and that was a strong dose for me when I was brand new to opiates.  I also got some benzos and flexeril I could through in the mix but ill probably save those for later.  Im also considering getting some kratom again, would codeine go well with it?  Thanks in advance for any advice or experience anyone has to offer!  I know most of you are well beyond codeine and hydro but Im sure most of you have dabbled and have some experience in the matter.

Never used the needle. I primarily use first thing in the morning when I wake up, then redose throughout the day - my first dose is always the largest though.
 
I have 2 and a half zubsolv's(5.7mg's of bupe/tablet) and a bottle of loperamide.

So, my question to you kind folks is: Which do you do? If the needle, why did you go that route? Did you start off snorting? Or did you just start off 'dipping-the-tip' right from the beginning? If the nose, are you happy with sniff? Or do you secretly wish to cross over to the pointy-side? 

Just curious about other users overall. More or less just wanting to start a conversation about the two different sides of the same wonderful (opiate-y) coin which I can read before I head to work this afternoon.

**EDIT** Some really great stuff, guys and gals. roughly 80% shooters on here... little intimidating. lol jk 

Look forward to some thought-provoking responses.

Well he wasn't quite as experienced as myself, so he did about half of size of my dose, and I shot up first.  At first I was fine, it was good but didn't feel like too much.  I gave him the go ahead to do his dose, then sat down on my bed.

I woke up about three hours later with a bad headache and my friend was lying next to me cold and unresponsive.  He had overdosed and his body had already set into rigamortis.  I wasn't sure of the time frame though so i rushed him to the hospital right by my house and waited in the waiting room til they came out shortly after and told me he had been gone for a while already.

After that the cops came and I got some stupid unrelated charges that got dropped, but that's besides the point, I just feel really guilty for a few reasons.

Firstly, I know he was a user, and I didn't force him to do it with me, but I still feel like it's partly my fault that he's gone because I sort of guided him with the dose.  I don't understand how the amount he did killed him but I am still alive after doing twice the amount.  I feel like I've gotten so close to that line so many times, but have always managed to avoid any consequences, and I think that's led to a significant amount of survivors guilt.

Every time I'm not kept busy I feel like I go back to thinking about how I'm responsible for losing him so it leads to a lot of hating myself and being depressed and wishing i could go back in time and trade my life to prevent all the pain I've brought on those around me.  thankfully I'm not suicidal because that would be the worst possible way to honor my friend after his loss, the opposite of what he would want for me.

How would you guys come to terms with it if you were in my shoes?

I don't use opiates anymore, although that's mainly due to lack of supply or money, so I can kind of lie to myself and say that he didn't die for nothing, but I know that's just me trying to comfort myself and it only makes me feel selfish.

I don't really have any friends right now after moving to a new state, so at least I won't be bringing others down anymore and in the future I am going to avoid doing risky things with others altogether.

how can I keep my mind off it?  should I?  anyone been through something similar?

Every muscle in my body was pulling the strings of my mind, the ceaseless pain was enough to drive anyone crazy, man or woman. I sat up on my beautiful, crisp leather couch hushing the words ""Shut up"" to myself. This couch was different, it wasn't like most, it was covered in burn holes, cigarette ash, stains, the frame was protruding out from the center forming a nice cushion for the center of my back throughout the night. Every fabric of this couch was grazing my skin in the most uncomfortable fashion. In the process of sitting up I immediately lost my ability to focus on anything but the sensation of bugs crawling all over my skin from the top of my head down my back and arms. I twitched in displeasure and began to sweat. ""I could sell some of these fake amazon gift cards on craigslist again, that would give me 20 right there."" I hesitated at the words that just came out of my mouth, glaring at the cards sitting on the table as if they had insulted me. I quickly grabbed them and slid them into my right pocket. My occupation shifted to salesperson that day. I glanced at the glass panel sitting on the table gently dusted in the powder of the previous bags i've gotten over the course of the past week. I immediately hopped up from the couch with eagerness grabbing my debit card for my recently closed bank account. I glanced at it in my hurry to scrape up all of the residue and powder from the glass panel and had a thought to myself of something involving regret but I was unwelcoming to the feeling. All I cared about was ending the pain and discomfort.

I scraped all of it up into a small pile in the center noticing that it was full of dust and cat hair as well. Maybe 1/3 of the pile was actually heroin, but that was enough for me to quickly scuffle for a needle. ""This will give me the energy I need to just stand up and move around for the next few hours, I need to come up with something quick."" I thought to myself at this point already drawing the dirty, brown liquid up into the syringe. My body was running on autopilot as my mind wandered. I took a deep breath as I flicked the last bubble out of the needle, watching it shrink into nothingness.  I pushed the needle against the skin of my wrist waiting for that ""pop"" when the dull metal finally pierced my skin. I felt the second pop as it went into my vein, first shot. I sighed with relief and registered already knowing I had it. I quickly pushed this dirty liquid into my blood stream hoping that in the next 10 seconds, some relief would come my way. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I was gone, at this point I was no longer myself, I was willing to do anything I could to score. The person talking inside my head was no longer me. 

I hopped up from my couch and tripped over my shoe, this feeling was almost like I broke everything in my body. Every organ, bone and cartilage in my body just shattered during this fall. I pulled myself up with the door knob leading to society. The pain was intense but I couldn't care anymore, I had to do this. I stepped as fast as my frail bones would let me down the staircase from my second story apartment. Stumbling over my own feet. My eyes were tearing, the sun burned my eyes and I couldn't see, my eyelids forced themselves closed in pain. The corneas of my eyes refused to adjust. I glanced around with my one squinted eye trying to find something, anything. The door to my neighbors apartment was wide open. I shuttered, ""YES"" was the only sound replaying inside my mind. I walked over and knocked on the door. ""Hello? Anyone there?"" I stuttered in curiosity. I poked my head in glancing around a little while holding my arms close to my torso as if I was under-clothed in the middle of winter. The gentle breeze of the summer day was freezing to my skin. I took a few steps in and said hello again, still not receiving a response. I began postulating the different scenarios in my head, how would I explain myself being here if he shows up. What would I say if anyone questions me. I immediately thought ""I came over here because It seemed like someone was robbing the place, the door was wide open the owner was gone, it was a prime target for someone malicious."" That's it, that is what I would tell anyone who asked as I shivered for the millionth time, I'm just a vigilante trying to protect my neighbors. I glanced around noticing the numerous electronics. Blu-ray players, game consoles, computer equipment, all of these things were simply heroin in my eyes. I looked at the half gram of heroin sitting on the counter plugged into an iphone charger. Quickly grabbed the phone and the charger and popped the sim card out. ""Safe"" I thought. I didn't let greed take hold of me. I quickly spun around and went to leave. ""If anyone saw me come here, I wasn't in here long enough to take anything and didn't have anything in my hands when I left"" I thought to myself while groaning a bit in displeasure. I quickly left and pulled out my phone texting my dealer. ""I've got an Iphone for trade, would you give me a half gram for it?"" I sent to him as I was slowly walking back to my apartment a few hundred feet away. Each step took every bit of energy my body could muster, I lost my breath walking 40 feet or so. ""This is surely hell"" I thought. A deep remorse for what i'd done was slowly intertwining my spine. It creeped up my back but I shrugged it away. Every minute waiting for my dealers response was an hour's worth of time in my mind. 7 minutes go by when my phone vibrates, sending shock waves of excitement down the core of my bones. My dealers name popped up on the screen ""yes, meet me at the gas station near you right now, in the area"" I dropped everything and started power walking as fast as I possibly could. The gas station was about a 3-5 minute walk from my front step. This entire walk was pure bliss. I already had it planned out in my mind. I would walk over there make the exchange go into the bathroom of the gas station and finally find my relief. All sense of remorse for what i'd done was gone. Faded into the thoughts of pleasure.

I see my dealers truck as I walk up to the gas pumps, he nods his head as he sees me approaching telling me to come hop in with his eyes. I knew this look by now. Every part of me was aching by the time I reached his door handle, the bones in my hands were crippled. I could barely open the door. I did and hopped in, he looked at me and could automatically tell what was going on, I was sick as a dog. He knew this. He wasted no time, I handed him the phone and he looked it over for a second making sure it turned on and worked and then said ""Alright"" he handed me the bag. ""I made it fat for you, it's .75 instead of .5"" he said to me with a smile on his face. ""Thank you so much!"" I sighed in exasperation. I grabbed it and rushed out the door, ""I'll hit you up later!"" I said to him as I was already half way to the door. He smiled and pulled away in a hurry. I walked in the front door of the gas station taking in a breath of fresh air knowing this is the building which would give me the most pleasure today. This is the building where I will stop drowning today. ""Thank you... so much"" I kept repeating to myself, knowing what was to come.

Been clean for 3 or so months which I know is good because im not craving it like i used to but I feel like somethings missing from my life.

I'm 13 weeks away from finishing my degree which is all sorts of good but currently have no IRL friends that I can catch up with in my downtime so its just me and my computer which is all sorts of sad as I used to have a big social group to vent/chill/drink with.

I just dont see things getting any better, I've tried the sober thing and no one I meet has any interest in clubbing/drinking/going out and so I have to fill my alone time with mundane shit like marathoning tv shows and the odd video game.

Heroin is euphoric unlike this xanax(i get it really cheap in powder form, roughly $1.20 per 2mg) which really just helps me to sleep and not dream, I'm not a big fan of having dreams as they remind me of when I was happy and had friends..

The only downside of heroin is the cost, I dont have a job and rely on the government for money so i cant support an on-going habbit but get to take a vacation away from the dulless of life when it gets em down.

Problem is I'd have to basically steal cash from my parents in order to get a G at the moment and since Dad's retiring tomorrow I feel sort of bad for taking their money..

But yeah what I wouldnt give for a few days of heroin induced bliss, I miss the needle, the warmth, the euphoria, the numbess.

I mean if you had no one to talk to why wouldnt you use the stuff I guess...

I've ingested an unknown quantity of xanax and alcohol tonight and am struggling to write this but felt like I needed a vent.

Heroin is great, heroin is love, but heroin is expensive....tis a shame about the last one inparticular.

Will I jump back on the horse? ehh still not sure, could care less right now that i've made it 3 months sober but making up lies to get money when my parents are about to stop getting a steady income makes me feel a little scummy.

I could pawn my bicicylle, that would get me like half a gram I guess, but on the other hand I do have friends in another state who want to see me so I should really buy a ticket to go see them and have some fun times, it just feels like thats so far in the future even though it would be 4 weeks away...

Heroin or trip interstate....I guess you know you have a problem when your all alone and people want to see you but you have to buy a ticket to fly interstate to see them and your considering being alone with drugs over seeing your real friends...

How I wish this semester could just be over so I could move to where they are and have a chat with people, everyone I meet at uni is so straight edge with no aspirations of clubbing/pubbing etc and I'm the kidn o person who needs that in life...being alone with just me and my computer simply isnt enough.

Anyway xanax/booze filled rant over, thanks for the listen, I guess we'll see some monday if I end up taking $250 from my parents credit card or just hold out for happier days when I get to chat with people who mean something to me.

I just read a thread regarding codeine and thought I would share my experience with it.   I've been addicted to opiates for around twenty years,  primarily codeine, and the first time I used was a 60mg dose and it was love at first sight for me. That soon escalated to a 400mg 4 times a day habit, two stints in rehab and a couple of arrests before I registered as an addict and started subs.  


I've been on the subs for five months and they've been a life saver for me. I've never injected (very pale skin and hardly a visible vein plus a fear of needles) and understand the rush will not compare with that, but the addiction is very real. obviously if you inject then oral codeine won't do much except maybe lessen WDs.  


although the WDs from codeine won't compare to H it's still pretty shitty and people tend to discard the psychology of addiction - if you're addicted to any opiate then the craving is going to be just as severe.  


I've smoked H on numerous occasions (pharmaceutical quality yay) and apart from the onset i didn't find the nod to be too different.  I've tried numerous other opiates (DHC, morphine etc) and have only found oxycodone to give a 'different' high. The only drug I really dislike is tramadol.  It did absolutely nothing for me even at doses of 400mg+.  


So each to their own DOC and ROA - when you get to the point of major addiction and it's fucking your life up I don't see what difference the cause is.

I just wanted your guys opinion about whether I fucked up or just got incredibly unlucky. My guy's access has been spotty, 50/50 odds probably. 

I text him ""Not ordering, I'm holding my standard amount ($200), but do you have access today man? I'm out of town so I can't pick up until like 9pm."" He texts me back ""Yeah man things are good, I've got you covered."" So I think sweet, text him ""Cool, I'll see you later today"" and put my phone back in my pocket, keep doing what I'm doing about 2 hours away from hometown.

20-30 minutes later I get a call asking where I am and telling me to meet up ASAP. Obviously this did not go down too well, he covered me until I got back and we made the exchange. I'm down a dealer now andjust.. frustrated and wondering whether I did this to myself. Is this my fault?

As part of the ""this did not go to well"" he told me I ""fucked him royal"" and ""this is a big deal, we might not be doing business anymore"". Afterwards I assume he finished up the deal with me because he needed the cash he spotted me more than the dope, but I'm guessing.

Edit: Guys, sorry if this is still confusing. It was a really confusing exchange for me, I'm still trying to figure out where things went. I didn't write it out too well either, hopefully it's a little clearer.

I really didn't want to lose this hookup, so I apologized profusely and kicked him a lot of the bag. He said we were cool and things seemed alright for a few days, but then he just stopped taking my calls or texts. This was over a week ago. I know through the grapevine he's still dealing.

(A true short story),"I awaken feeling uneasy and sick at 7am like any other day.  Unaware of the events that lay before me.  My nose is runny and my legs aching a very familiar ache.  I get dressed and prepare myself for the next 8-12 hours at work which I know will feel like an eternity.  After work I will be able to get high, to relieve myself of these aching pains and running nose.  I slowly creep up the stairs from the basement to the front door and into my car.  The drive to work is short and before I know it I'm already there. 


I jump in the work van with lets call him Chris.  Chris is my boss, he is partial owner of the HVAC (heating and air conditioning) company that I just started working for 3 months ago.  He and I talk or should I say, he talks.  He talks and talks and doesn't shut up.  I don't feel like talking.  I don't feel like listening.  All I feel like doing is getting high.  The day passes very slowly.  Riding from call to call with him showing him what I know technically about HVAC and showing him that I know how to communicate with customers properly.  This is beginning to take its toll on me.  I'm fucking sick, I don't feel like trying right now.  I wish I had saved some dope from the night before but no, I'm to much of a junkie to think about tomorrow. I was only worried about how high I could get last night, I'll figure tomorrow out tomorrow.  


At about 1 o'clock I text my friend, lets call her Maggie.  I text Maggie and I tell her that I want her to call me kinda freaking out.  I wanted her to act as my girlfriend....and act like we had a lot of water leaking out of our ceiling.  Then infront of my boss I would answer her call and begin to freak out and act like there was a problem at my house hopefully allowing me to leave work early and rid my body of this sickness.  My phone begins to ring and I answer casually, ""Hello?  Hey sweetie, whats up?  WHAT??!!?  Shit, go into the laundry room and find the shut off valve....""  My boss asks, ""Whats up?""  I said, ""There is water leaking from my ceiling, hold on....""  ""Maggie, can you find the shut off valve?""  She tells me no and I said to my boss.....""Chris man, I hate to ask this but can you take me home?  I need to cut the day a little short, my girlfriend says we've got water leaking pretty badly from our ceiling into our room.""  I get the OK from my boss and we head back to the shop so I can jump in my car and head home.  A wave of relief has come over me at this point.  I know I will feel the pure bliss that is heroin soon enough.  We get back to the shop and I quickly thank him and jump into my car and speed home.  I call Maggie and tell her to meet me back at my house.  


On the ride home I am frantically calling my real girlfriend, lets call her Lauren.  Lauren liked to stay awake all night and sleep all day til I got off of work so she wouldn't have to deal with being sick all day.  We made the ride to the dope man almost every day.  I call Lauren over and over again but cannot get her to wake up.  I arrive at my house, jump out of the car and run inside screaming, ""Lauren come on wake up, we're gonna go up!  Wake up, Hey Lauren!""  I run down the stairs and wake her from her sleep.  She is confused and doesn't understand whats going on....she says, ""Why are you home so early?""  ""It doesn't matter come on, get dressed, we're going up.""  After what feels like an hour we are walking out the door.  As we walk out the door, I see Maggie's car coming down the street, ""Thank god,"" I think to myself.  Maggie and her boyfriend get out of their car and jump into mine and we begin our journey to the dope man.  I fucking hate this guy, he takes all my money and he lives so far away.  I wouldn't mind giving him all my money if he was my neighbor.  The drive there is about an hour but it feels like a year.  


I call the dope man and let him know I am 10 minutes away.  He tells me to go to a spot which I have never met him at before and I ask for directions on how to get there.  He gets angry and starts yelling at me, ""Man you know where it is, you been there before, hurry up I'm about to be there!""  I have never met him at this spot before but he likes to blame me for not knowing my way around his neck of the woods.  I don't want to piss him off any more so I apologize and tell him, ""Ok my bad, I know where you're talking about.""  He wanted us to meet him at this park, but I wasn't sure where it was.  Fortunately we were on the road that the park was on and Lauren points out, ""There it is!  Turn in here.""  I turn in and park and within a minute the dope man pulls up.  I give him the money and he tosses over the goods.  3.5 grams of pure bliss.  Sweet sweet heroin.  I say thanks and we both pull out of the park.  


Since we are not familiar with the area we search for the closest place to park and get down.  We pull into a gas station and quickly fix up.  Oh sweet relief....sweet sweet relief, its only a matter of minutes now.  My girlfriend hits me because she can do it quick.  She pushes the plunger in, I untie and wait....a wave of relief washes over me.  All my problems, all my cares, all my worries are washed away.  Washed away by a deep sea of heroin only to resurface at a later time and date.  But who cares, I'm only worried about how I feel right now and before that heroin hit my blood, I felt like shit.  Everyone in the car does their thing and gets right, we are ready to head home.  


The drive home is so much quicker than the drive there.  Before I know it we are almost home.  The only thing between us and home is the dead stop traffic.  I couldn't care less about sitting in traffic at this point, I welcomed the traffic.  It would allow me to get another fix in.  My girlfriend, Lauren, cooks up another shot for us to share.  We are merging from one highway onto another creeping forward an inch at a time.  I hand my arm over to her so she can hit me again.  A second wave of bliss washes over me.  Heroin feels so good.  We continue slowly moving forward, inch by inch.  The traffic where I live is absolutely horrible.  


After about 20 minutes of moving at the pace of a sloth there is a break in the traffic.  There in the middle of the highway sits 3 state troopers, which is normal for this time of day.  We move passed the police at around 40mph, well below the speed limit, when one pulls out.  Lauren exclaims, ""Oh fuck, a cop just pulled out.""  I tell her, ""Don't worry about it, he's not coming for us.""  The cop changes lanes, coming closer to our lane.  He changes lanes again, and one more time, he is behind us now.  I am thinking to myself, ""Oh fuck, please don't pull us over....""  The lights go up and he is trying to pull us over.  I continue driving and put my flashers on to let him know that I see him and am going to pull over once I find a safe place.  My Criminal Justice teacher in highschool had always told me to find a safe place to pull over out of traffic to keep the officer out of harms way.  I pull over at the next exit and the officer comes up to my window and asks for my license and registration.  I give him both items but he doesn't walk away from the car.  He says, ""Alright we both know whats up wheres the weed?""  Weed, ha.  I haven't smoked weed in 4 years whats this guy thinking?  ""Wheres the weed, wheres the dope,"" he says.  ""I can see the track marks on her arm and your eyes are pinned, wheres the dope?""  I think to myself, Oh fuck....how does he know, how did this happen?  The cop pulls me out of the car and asks me if I have anything in the car that he should know about.  I tell him no.  He then asks if he can search the car and I again tell him, ""No, you don't have any reason to search the car.""  He says, ""We can do this the easy way or the hard way, its up to you.""  I again tell him that I do not have anything.  By now several more cop cars have pulled up and an unmarked gold SUV.  The officer takes me to a cop car parked a few cars behind my car and leaves me with 3 officers.  Since I am high I begin to talk casually with them, cracking jokes that they don't find very funny.  The cops pull everyone else out of the car and begin asking them questions.  Under the passenger seat lies a green tupper-ware like container containing around 2.5 grams of heroin, several needles, cottons, a spoon and a lighter.  


Lauren and I had bought 3 grams of heroin, Maggie and her boyfriend had bought a half gram.  Fortunately for them, they had already snorted their way through the entire thing.  The officer goes into the car and begins searching for something.  Something that I can only image is my medicine.  The one thing that makes me feel okay, that keeps me from getting ill.  If he finds it I will surely go to jail and its not like it was really hidden....and my dealer doesn't give me a legitimate prescription for the stuff, he just gives it to me in a little baggy and sends me on my merry way.   The officer finds what he is looking for and is walking towards me.  ""Is this yours?"" he asks.  ""Yeah it is,"" I tell him.  ""OK,"" he says and he turns and walks away only to come back in a few minutes and give me a sobriety test.  I do exactly as he says and as far as I am concerned, I passed all his tests.  He handcuffs me and tosses me into the back of his squad car and I get charged with possession of heroin and DUI.  Lauren also gets arrested.  Maggie and her boyfriend are allowed to drive my car back to my house with my permission and drop it off.  


I am taken to the hospital to get blood taken to see how much heroin is in my body.  I tried to tell the cop that I am not giving him permission to take my blood because I knew I could refuse a breathalyzer test, why shouldn't I be able to refuse a blood test?  The cop tells me he doesn't care and to shut up.  Man this cops a dick.  He walks me into the hospital and everyone begins to stare.  I get a very uncomfortable, uneasy feeling in my stomach.  The weight of what is happening begins to set in.  I get my blood taken and we return to the officers car.  Now we are headed to jail.  ""Fuck....."" I begin to think, ""I really fucked up this time.""  I spend the night in jail only to be bailed out by my ever so pleased step-father the next day.  My mom doesn't know what has happened yet, I didn't want to call her from jail again.  I already had to do that a few years back when I flipped and rolled my car cause I was driving home drunk as shit.  I get back to my house to find Lauren asleep in our bed.  She had gotten bailed out the night before by a friend but didn't have the money to get me out of jail.  I go over to my parents house the next day and explain to my mom that I have a problem, I need to go to rehab.  My mom keeps me on lockdown for the next day until I can be admitted to rehab.  


I found out a later date that when Lauren was shooting me up as we merged from one highway to another the gold SUV that was in the lane next to us was an undercover off duty US Marshall.  He had seen the entire thing and radioed the state police and gave them the make, model and license plate number of my car.  The state police pulled me over because I was driving around with dead tags.  Lauren had gotten arrested because the US Marshall had seen her shoot me up.  This was the very beginning of my very long road to recovery.  I wish I had learned my lesson then.......


Edit:  I called my boss when I got out of jail and tried explaining to him why I wasn't at work.  I told him that I was in the hospital because I fell and hurt my chest skateboarding........he called me on my bullshit and told me he had seen me getting arrested on the side of the road the day that it all went down.  So that didn't work out very well for me either.  Just a quick fun fact though.




Hope you enjoyed that.  I don't consider myself much of a writer or story teller.

Dont be an idiot, and if you do drugs, do em responsibly.*

So its the end of the month, and my drug of choice (oxy's) usually start becoming scarce and hard to find until the beginning of next month. This month was no different. I woke up, called up my sources, and my main guy (lets call him Chris) said he is waiting to pick them up, and he would call me back. I waited a few hours, called him back, and he said he would call me. Another few hours went by. By this time i was starting to feel real shitty. I only did 1 30mg yesterday, when im used to doing 2-3 at once. My cousin (lets call him Antwan) called and said he had 2-3. He is more expensive than Chris, so i usually only use him as a last resort. I told him to give me a few minutes, and i called Chris back and asked if he a timeframe on when it could be, because my cousin just called. He said it would be about 20 minutes then i could leave. So i called my cousin back and told him no. I waited about 30 minutes and went and picked up Chris and he said he had to go to a few places, and asked if it was alright if we took him (i was with my gf). Of course we said fine, and after about a hour of driving, he handed us the pills and said he needed to go to Wendy's then home. We get to Wendy's and it is packed. He decided to go inside, so i thought this is my opportunity to go do a couple in the bathroom as he orders. I go into the bathroom stall, pull out my syringe ""pack"" and get everything started, crushed up the pill, put it into my cap, and tried turning on the sink - no water. FUCK! No there are people waiting to use my stall so i couldnt leave it. Looking around i found the only water source - the toilet. This Wendy's was only about 2 weeks old, the toilet and the water looked clean, and at the time i couldnt fathom losing 3 pills. So i flushed the toilet to be sure, used my cap and scooped up some water and did my pills. Thinking about it, that was just stupidly retarded. Yes, i went full retard. I didnt get sick or anything (thank god), and it made me realize just the stupid things drugs will make you do.

Up until yesterday, I had been obtaining my heroin from the open-air drug market in my city, never buying from the same person twice. Cold-copping actually worked for me at first, as the dope I received wasn't half-bad, but for the last two weeks i've only been getting low-quality stuff. I spent $80 last week alone and never got more than a mild high, no matter how much I smoked in one-sitting. 
I went to the market yesterday, intending to find another African-American gentleman to purchase from and then never see again. But as I walked through the outskirts of the market, I ran into an old acquaintance and chatted with him for a while, eventually voicing my interest in chiva and distaste of the cold-copping process. He offered to hook me up, and so I spent $60 and received three pea-sized black chunks, all mostly-odorless and relatively brittle. We traded numbers and he told me to hit him up whenever.
I tried his stuff last night and, to my utmost delight, found myself in a state of mind reminiscent of the first time I did heroin correctly (which occurred around a month ago). 
Anyway I'm pleased with myself and feel good about having a reliable connection. Now all I need to find is a disposable butane lighter that's not prone to breaking easily...

So my question is: Is there any reason why I have such a high tolerance from codeine, from only using it twice with a few weeks inbetween? And why am i not getting any of the itchyness?

In a few days I'm planning to do around 210mg. Will i get a bad trip from that, considering what doses i've already tried?

Sitting in the darkness of my closed eyes once again. The sun was bright and felt warm on my cut-up black clothes. This summer breeze wasn't freezing cold against my skin anymore, it slid past my skin like my lovers lips. I let out a sigh of pleasure as I opened my eyes just as quickly as I began sinking back into bliss. ""What was worse, the fact I was stuck in this play and couldn't escape, or that I preferred staring at the closed curtains over the show it's self?"" I thought to myself, mumbling a bit to try and remember that I was a human being here on planet earth. I could feel all of my belongings pushing against my legs in my pockets. This gave me an extra sense of security knowing I wouldn't have to try and find anything, wasting this wonderful feeling on something so tedious. I opened my eyes again, glancing around the park I was in. Ducks and geese were gliding along the surface of the crystal tides, the cascading liquid falling from the waterfalls on both sides of me. This constant sound was comforting, helping me forget how empty my life was. Sometimes, I hated the life I'd made. I'm clinging to this version of life that I no longer recognized but was in love with. ""I love this so much"" I sighed out loud to myself while stretching back into the old, worn out park bench. My phone began to ring in my pocket which didn't spark my interest at all in this moment. Reaching down with my eyes closed, I clicked the ""volume down"" button of my phone through the thickness of the fabric of my jeans in an attempt to tune out the world. A few more brief moments of serenity before I must continue on with the flow of life. 

Startled awake by the sound of my phone once more I swiftly reached into my pocket, somewhat in a rage thinking ""Who could this possibly be right now?"" My roommates name was on the screen, it took me a few seconds to fully understand what was happening. I clicked answer and dragged my hand up to my head to listen to what this voice had to say. ""Eric? Is this Eric? You need to come back now!"" The words stung my ear in a way that I couldn't describe. ""Yes,"" I responded ""who is this on my roommates phone?"" I uttered, my eyes half open. ""It's his girlfriend, I just showed up at the apartment and he's not breathing, unconscious, blue and kind of shaking every minute or so you need to get over here now what is going on with him"" the voice buzzed unpleasantly in my ear once again. I was unfazed at this situation, it's something i'd experienced dozens of times before. I immediately knew what was going on, he was overdosing there wasn't a whole lot I could do. I muttered ""Lay him flat on the floor on his back and lift his head up gently about an inch or so off the ground, i'll be there soon call 911 and just request an ambulance and say that you found your boyfriend unconscious and don't know what's going on. If you know CPR then do it"" as I jumped up from the bench sighing to myself. The park suddenly became disgusting, the water became muddy and dark, the sound of the waterfalls cascading suddenly sounded like metal grinding in my mind. I trudged my feet as fast as I could move them at a steady jog to my apartment which was a block away. My apartment was visible from the edge of the park. I looked at the entrance to my apartment as I was jogging towards it, I felt a piece of myself sinking to the thoughts ""It's been an hour since I left, we dosed together and he chose to stay home instead of come to the park with me. It's been an hour, it's been an hour, it's been an hour, it's been an hour."" These words kept repeating in my mind relentlessly. I was almost to my front door at this point, my body numb unable to feel the force that was just exerted on my legs. Bursting through the front door of my apartment I immediately fell to the ground of my living room floor and started giving him CPR, his girlfriend was crying saying ""the ambulance should be here any second."" Reluctant to the thought, I continued CPR and glanced at my roommates face. Immediately I broke, I turned to glass in this moment and shattered. I dug my fingers in for a pulse on his cold neck, tears starting to stream from my eyes. Nothing. Shivers sunk down my spine as I lost my breath. The sounds of pain were everywhere, it's all I could hear. Between his girlfriend crying and myself screaming in my mind the world faded to black. 

Sirens were loud at this point, I heard people storming up the stairs. I stood up to talk for his girlfriend, who was petrified. ""Narcan, he needs narcan, now please, narcan, I don't know, it's too late, it's too late, I don't know how long it's been. Please. Hurry."" was something along the lines of how I mustered my last words of this ordeal. I dropped down to my knees in the hall of my apartment thinking ""this substance that killed my friend is in my body right now and i'm here, alive."" Shuttering at the realization of what was happening, I lost control of my thoughts. 

During this moment, all I could think of was another shot, another line, just take the stress all away. I hated this thought. This thing just killed my friend and all that I can think of is putting more of it in myself. What was I? Why was I sitting here alive? These thoughts were drowned out by the realization that my best friend was dead. ""I love you"" I thought. ""I'm sorry I wasn't here to save you."" My thoughts disappeared letting a torrent of voices fill the void of my mind. ""time of death, heroin, overdose, gone, lost, life,"" The words continued pouring in. 

The screams of his girlfriend, while she was gripping me harder than anything I've ever felt in my life are the strongest memory I have of that day. I occasionally find myself daydreaming about this moment, and can feel the squeeze on my body like I was sitting there all over again, kneeled on the floor of my living room, paralyzed.

I'm writing a screenplay involving a college age heroin dealer. I've never personally used or dealt, so I have no firsthand experience. I was just hoping I could get a little research done here. 

I guess the main thing i'm looking for is common lingo - what slang is extremely common?

Second thing is anything you feel is visual or cinematic about Heroin/dealing. Any description of what a junkie in need looks like, or what being in the middle of a high looks like, etc. Of course I already have an idea in my head, but i'd love to hear visual descriptions from the people who have been there.

Lastly, anything else that you think I should know. I'd love to learn anything.

My question is, if I take morphine or oxycodone, for example, will I relapse and go through WD again? Are they different enough from hydros that they won't put me though WD again?

So I got caught/came clean to my parents about a year ago about my addiction to pain killers ( mostly 30s and some times opana when jj was looking down on me heh ;-)....) and was clean until about a month ago. When I finally told my parents about my addiction last year my mom brought up a lot of religious ideas when addressing why drug abuse is a sin and all that jazz.. Talking about going to hell and stuff like that for all the lies and shit I was doing to cover my up habit from her. 

-- Go back 2 years ago --  when one of my best friends that I had known since elementary school passed away from drug abuse. I asked my mother if she thought my friend was in heaven or hell. Looking back at this argument I regret asking her this because it was a mean spirited question. But i had recently heard someone say "" How could people really enjoy heaven knowing that so many people were burning in hell?"" This question really made me think. I don't believe in heaven or hell but i guess how do people that do answer this question? What is heaven really? The idea of heaven must be different from person to person. I guess my main question is what do you guys think when you have to make moral decisions regarding your addiction. I know for me I just stopped caring as a lot of people do. At the same time people who aren't addicts I assume don't understand how some people can just stop caring. Anyone think about things similar to this?? 

Sorry If this question isn't very clear but I think a lot of us have thought about things like this. I'm kind of faded and just wanted to hear from other people about this topic because It's been on my mind a lot lately.

I sit down in my chair at home and start prepping the shot, but i realize i forgot to get a cotton out, so i put down the prepped solution/dish and grab a cotton.

We all come from different settings and unique situations, so I bet each of our 'first time' stories are completely different.

Feel free to go into as much or as little detail as you like. As for me, I'm going to do the medium-length version. So, here it is, never before told: the story of how I first used opiates.

I was sick with severe Crohn's disease (still am, but that's another story), and in horrible pain. I was home alone, and I remembered there was a bottle of liquid hydrocodone/apap solution in our pantry (my dad had just had a surgery and they gave it to him as a liquid, since he had trouble taking pills).

I was in a lot of pain so I took double the dose recommended for my father (looking back it was probably just like 12mg total of hydrocodone, but at the time I had no tolerance, LOL). The liquid tasted like shit (though I later learned to sort of enjoy it - almost), but I slammed it down and chased it with some Squirt and it wasn't too bad.

About 30 minutes later, the warm sensation washed over me. You all know the sensation I'm talking about or you wouldn't be on this sub. My entire body started to tingle just slightly in the most pleasant way. A few more minutes in and the excruciating pain was gone. That day I took a jog, something I could've never done otherwise due to pain. I remember coming back inside after and being so happy that I cried.

And that's how I wound up an opiate user. I Told my doctor that I'd tried some vicodin and it had given me my life back, and he gave me the prescription. Unfortunately, now it's years later and I've been on every opioid you can think of (outside of heroin), with a sky high tolerance. My chronic pain is gone now, which is great - but it means I've gotta go through the joys of the Suboxone  program, which is less great (though it bears withdrawals any day).",1407085978.0

I recently started suboxone therapy (to quit a 200mcg/h transdermal fentanyl habit). The suboxone worked fine, but my insurance won't cover it, so I got moved to Subutex. It also works fine.

But here's the question: whether it's Suboxone or Subutex, either one is a tablet that dissolves slowly under my tongue, and leaves an ungodly taste (think chewing tobacco stuffed up an asshole and you're imagining the flavor quite well).

I currently have an odd workaround: I put the Subutex tablet under my tongue and then drop the contents of a Pixy Stick into my mouth. The Pixy Stix help my tongue to create more moisture, and they also help mask the ungodly flavor.

My question is: what else can I do? Surely there's a better way? There's just something about the flavor that I find intolerable; I've come close to vomiting multiple times (before I started using the 'Pixy Stix method').

Yes, I'm 100% serious. Any serious suggestions are greatly appreciated.",1407084501.0

Been a long time since I've had a trip of any kind, so about a month or two ago I bought a big bottle of orange delsym. I wasn't sure when I wanted to indulge but last night around 9pm I said fuck it and downed it seeing as I was out of Oxymorphone, my doc. I was having a magical trip, very enlightening and emotional through the first few hours after it finally took hold. I swam through the void reminiscing on old times with old friends when i thought a shot would be a godly combo with this awesome trip. So me being dumb I hit up my good friend who also frequents this sub told him to call me when he got off work as he works til 3:30am. Soon as i send it he calls and my dumb ass drives while tripping to pick him up. We go half on a 15 moon and since I'm still rather disoriented from the long lasting delsym hes a bro and hits me with a shot and that rush paired with the dxm stomped me. Absolutely amazing combination. This post may seem rather pointless, but I want to know if anyone else has had good experiences with opiates and dxm.

I'd usually insinuate that heroin was the force behind this blissful agony but I knew deep down, that was simply my facade. The walls closed in around me forcing a thrust of air into my lungs as I sank deeper into the abyss of my mind. Spiraling ever further into my self inflicted madness, I glanced at the stylishly tan powder, elegantly positioned there in the center of the crystal pane of the finest glass known to man. My eyes lusted the sight of this substance. I found my center of gravity shifting inevitably towards this chemical. Spoken words split into unintelligible syllables of indistinguishable sounds that meant nothing to me as they grazed my ear drums. Finding my mind being caressed deeper into sedation, my thoughts became clouded. ""I'm not quite there, I should do more."" The electricity in my mind sparked with delight at this thought. I found myself already choking a little on saliva, seemingly being invited into my lungs. My center of gravity inched closer, as I noticed my body sitting up leaning inward to the glass panel. Letting out a sigh of blissful tranquility, I smiled as I scraped another shot from my pile of treasure. Particles rolled over one another as if they were colliding to shore, the riptide would follow soon enough, pulling me in yet again to this endless ocean of dreadful peace. 

Eyes closed, my muscles loose, the clouds of pleasure carried my arm in to grab the beautifully hand cast spoon. As I set it down, chiming against the glass, this all too familiar yet beautiful melody played. Lifting up a second card I stopped for a moment to admire this sensation. Unaware of my body, my mind adrift, my arms sank closer to the floor as I fell further back into ecstasy. A disembodied voice chimed in from a different world ""Are you about to do more? I don't think that's a good idea."" Jumbled worlds fell from my lips ""yeah.. of course"" my eyes still secured shut. ""I'm fine"" I thought out loud to myself. Readjusting my posture to complete the task at hand I opened one eye to make sure I could navigate my hands through the air. Scooping the powder up with precision, I craned my arms over to drop it into the silver pit. Falling into the spoon a scent wafted up into the air, this smell sent delight down my spine, rippling throughout my body. 
As I began pulling water up into the syringe, my fingers shaking, my body swaying, I began whistling a jingle that had just popped into my mind. ""I think it's gonna raiiinnn, ohh, when I die"" I sang out loud to myself, mixing the concoction together with ease. I dropped a fresh puff of cotton down into the mixture of the the 2/3 things my body required to live. Heroin, Water, Food, in that order. Pressing the tip of the needle against the cotton, I began suctioning the murky liquid deep into the needle. The once vast oasis of brown, now becoming a desert at the base of silver reflection. My wonderful, gorgeous woman strutted over, sitting down softly next to me on my throne. I reached up, flicking the remaining bubbles out of the syringe for the third time as she leaned into to my left ear whispering gently ""Would you like some help, sweet heart?"" The smell of her perfume tickled the inside of my nose with pleasure as she ever so softly ran her lips down the side of my neck. I wrapped the belt around my right arm again, feeling weak as I fought to stay aware. She reached out grabbing the belt with one hand while sliding her other gently down the middle of my back, massaging any leftover tenseness out from my mind. 

As she slid her soft lips upwards, caressing the other side of my neck with her hand, the needle began to kiss the skin of my arm. Lovingly, the needle bites my skin. A relieving sigh was pulled out from my lungs as the blood expanded into the syringe and the walls expanded outwards once more. She released her grip on the belt around my arm as I exhausted the last of my energy streaming this fluid into my veins.  This beautiful woman looked deeply into my eyes as I met with hers. She began counting out loud while I peered unto her peaceful crystal blue gaze. ""3...4...5...6...7...8..."" I fell backwards slightly, further into euphoria as she laid her lips upon mine. Sending heavenly shockwaves through my body, I lost my breath once again.

I have never asked my hookups for a deal or shorted them. If I didn't have the cash I didn't go and pickup. I'm not that hard up that I need to short my guy and get a free bag every time.

I stumble across my old, metal cigarette case. Glancing at it, I experienced the most pleasurable flashbacks. All the times i'd busted that thing open to the goodies inside. Ranging from 5 grams to just one bag in there, I used to use it as a storage compartment wherever I would go.

Well, I just found it, picked it up and flipped it open and low and behold there's 3-4 little pebbles in there rolling around as I flicked it open. I was a bit taken back. I've been clean for 30 days. I immediately picked one up and rolled it in my fingertips a little bit and then brought the tip of my index finger to my tongue to get a taste, of what I was thinking was dope. Boy was that a bitter, fruitful, nostalgic taste of the past. It was dope, about a half a point's worth. I just broke them down and eagerly snorted it up. 

This was such a pleasant surprise. I'd been clean for a month, (not really under my control, but at the same time i'd been wanting to be clean for a while to get my old mind back, not have to worry about sickness). It looks like i'll be nodding today, enjoying the sun. Oh, this day couldn't be any better.

I took it for a week, but wasn't ready nor happy with my dose so I quickly got off it and binged on dope for another week and a half.

The first time I got on sub, I precipitated withdrawal and was PISSED. I was gonna do it right the second time.

So Saturday morning was my last dose. I only had 1 bag and whatever was able to be scraped off the other 5 I bought, so it was a tiny dose that didn't even get me very high. By the end of the day, I started to feel sick. 

Sunday: I felt pretty sick. I took a lot of loperamide until I felt well (probably 60 pills). Later in the day, I started to feel bad again so I took more.

Monday: I woke up feeling pretty good. Loperamide is great stuff. I felt the tinges of withdrawal there, though, underneath the muted, blurry fix of immodium's constipated veil, and decided it was time to get back on my subs. I remembered how hellish the last time I got on was, and — despite being *absolutely positive* I'd waited long enough — only took a small amount (half of about a third of an 8mg tablet — it's hard to say how much). Within the hour, I felt the withdrawal coming on — HARD. I had to leave for work almost as soon as it hit, which made my subway ride pretty terrible. One I got off at my stop, I made a beeline for CVS and got myself 2 96 count bottles of generic immodium (they were out of the 260 ones — I stole them all) and took almost an entire one of them.

Now I'm feeling ok — much better by comparison — but now possess the knowledge that if I'm going to get on sub *without* a PWD, I'll have to bear the full brunt of my withdrawal and quit the lope maintenance too.

Sucks doughnut.

Anyway, thought y'all should know it. Loperamide does (if you take *enough* of it) lead to precipitated withdrawal.",1407180149.0

He told me that scoring heroin or any kind of opiate in Yukon, Alaska,  or Nunavut is rare and you have to pay out the fucking ass. When he got to Ontario the low price in comparison was too low to resist so he was going to grab an ounce to bring back home when he leaves, but this ball of fire ECP is for consumption during the stay.

Regarding going to the hospital while in pain management.,"Long story short, I have bulging discs in my spine causing pain. I am scripted 60 Norco 10s and 60 Lyrica 150mg. I think I hurt myself more. My pain feels different, it's more severe, it's now in a different area in addition to the usual areas. I went to my med refill appointment today and mentioned this but I didn't even get an exam. I got a prednisone pack and my scripts refilled. I can't sleep now because I am in so much pain. I can't stop crying. I took 4 of my norcos and it didn't even touch this pain. 

What should I do? 
1. Go to ER and get new images and pain meds. I'd have to disclose to PM about the visit and all drugs administered. 
2. Wait to see what prednisone pack does. If it doesn't help, call for another appt at PM, get an exam, and possibly new images. 
3. Just call tomorrow and forget about the prednisone.

I've smoked my fair share of weed and dabbled in dissociatives, stimulants, and psychadelics, but I haven't gone for the kingdom (if I can) because I haven't felt like enough of a man yet.  A friend of mine sent me a little bcoin and I'm considering making a purchase of some #4 off the road to try.  Keep in mind I have absolutely no connections for heroin outside of the darknet markets, so this is intended to be a one time thing (famous last words I know).  Obviously this isn't something I can speak to others about, I'm afraid to tell my friends even, but I want to hear opinions from those who know it best.  Was your first time fun?  Would you do it again?  Would you start with heroin?  IV it for one time use - go big or go home?  I really don't want to buy heroin again anytime in the near future, and I've read various first time reports saying the first time sucked and it didn't become enjoyable until after repeated use.  Thanks for honest input; I'm sorry if any of this comes off as judgmental in any way, I just want feedback from the people that actually know the drug rather than people talking out of their asses telling me I'll be homeless and have AIDS after trying it once.

I have never heard of this before, and was under the impression that unless a person had secondary health issues that no opiate withdrawal is lethal.

(short story),"The sun was shining so brightly that I could not keep my eyes open.  I wince, closing my eyes and bending my neck forward to stare at the ground.  Immediately I removed the sunglasses from my pocket and placed them on my face.  Still I could not bare to keep my eyes open.  Every time I tried, there was a sharp searing pain causing me to close my eyes and shed several tears.  The pain was strong enough to drive a man mad.  I slowly walk back inside thinking of a plan.  It was almost 11am, I would be sick soon if I did not get my fix.  Honestly, the word sick doesn’t even begin to describe how I would feel if I was unable to get my sweet, sweet heroin.  It starts with an eye watering yawn and molds into a restless panic of kicks and muscle-tearing stretches.  My body would begin to feel  cold as ice.  Colder than ice.  The chills would creep down my spine as my body began to shake attempting to raise its core temperature.  In an instant I would be hot.  Too hot.  A familiar sweat would begin leaking out of my skin, pouring from my arm pits, stomach and back causing the shirt I’m wearing to become multicolored and damp.  Worst of all, the smell of BO would tear its way into the threads that made this very shirt, a shirt.  Deodorant is not even a match for the foul sweats of withdraw.  Finally, I would to feel a slight discomfort in my stomach.  I knew what this discomfort meant and it was never a welcomed feeling.  If not dealt with quick enough, it would turn into….well the shits and I won’t get any more descriptive than that.  

The fear of being ill combined with the pain in my eye would put me into a state of being I call “junkie mode.”  “Junkie mode”  is not a place I ever truly want to be.  It transforms me into a wreck less, careless, don’t give a fuck about anyone or anything type of person.  I have but one goal once in “junkie mode,” and that is to put heroin into my bloodstream.  I only leave “junkie mode” and return to my normal junkie self by obtaining and using heroin.   

But I could barely walk outside with my eyes open, “How in the hell will I drive to Baltimore like this?” I thought to myself.  I walked into the bathroom and glanced into the mirror to see my right eye discolored and swollen, almost completely swollen shut.  Any form of light that penetrated my pupil would cause my eye to burn in pain.  “I really need to start taking my contacts out at night.” I said aloud.  “This shit is starting to get ridiculous.”  This wasn’t the first time I would drive to Baltimore with an eye infection nor would it be the last.  It seemed to  happened to me around once a month, all because I was to o lazy to take my contacts out when going  to sleep.  This pair of contacts had been in for close to 6 months without ever being removed. 

 I hated myself for going through with what I was about to do but I wasn’t going to just let myself get sick, besides I was already in “junkie mode,”  I didn’t even have a choice at this point.   I was terrified of the sickness.  Terrified like a child who has colored on the wall with markers  and its only a matter of time before his father sees it and will punish him for his wrong doing.   I would rather wrap my car around a pole trying to get my fix than have absolutely no chance of it.  I run downstairs to grab some extra supplies: a hat, a black t-shirt and a pair of socks.  Up the stairs and out the door I ran as fast as I could, time was running out.  The sickness would begin to take over soon.  

Immediately after opening  the door I was greeted by the blinding sun.  It felt like someone was steadily holding a laser pointer directly into my eye scattering my focused thoughts into a messy web of plausible ideas.   The sun laughed while I winced in pain.  A pain so strong that the toughest of gym rat douche’s would fall to their knees and beg for mercy.   “Quit being a bitch and just man the fuck up already.  Get in your car, start it and drive,” I told myself.  I stagger towards my car and get in.  I begin to wrap the black t-shirt around my head to shield my right eye from the sunlight.  I start the car and begin the dangerous hour long drive to the city.  Carelessly speeding down the highway I am forced to keep my head tilted down to keep my eye(s) from watering and to hide from the intense pain trying to keep me from getting my fix.   I can only see comfortably if I keep my eye focused on my knees.  I bring my head up and glance forward for a split second to see the road laid out before me.  It was filled with twists and turns and bumps and holes,  but even worse – innocent people on their way  to work or to see their loved one who lie ill in the hospital.   I have to turn my entire head left and right to check my mirrors for those innocent people who have no idea that I am driving so impaired.  If one of them were to make the wrong move and wind up in my blind spot, we might have a potentially dangerous accident on my hands.  “That is exactly what I don’t need to happen right now,” I thought to myself.   Driving around with a suspended license, on probation,  car filled with all sorts of drug paraphernalia, if I get in an accident I will surely be headed to jail, sick.  This is the kind of the thought that would sober me up just enough to make it safely to Baltimore.  

As I begin to take my exit, I reach for my phone to call my dealer and let him know I am almost there.  I begin to feel out of place, my skin color really stands out in these parts of town.  I have made this trip so many times I welcome the feeling because even though I think I stand out, it feels like home.  The buildings along the pot-hole infested road are boarded up and condemned.  I often wonder if there are homeless people living in them like in, The Wire.  Maybe I’ll run into Bubbles and he’ll hook me up  with the WMD or some Spider Bags.  I continue driving through the hood spinning my head in all directions looking out for the dreaded dudes in blue.  I’m sure they would love to fuck with a white boy who has a t-shirt wrapped around his face and out of state tags.  Hell, I’ll just tell them I’m lost, they’ve probably never heard that excuse before.  Maybe the black t-shirt will make them not notice my pasty white complexion.  

I get to the spot where I will meet my dealer.  I pull over and park on the side of the road across from a field containing a playground with children playing.  I can see the house that my dealer will soon emerge from carrying a small, tightly tied baggie containing the very thing I risk everything in my life for.  Heroin.  I had already lost my house, my job, countless friends and family, my license, my freedom….when would it be enough.  When would I realize that getting high was not worth even one of those things.  Not today.  Across the field and up the stairs a glass storm door swings open and out of the house walks a black male with a hat on his head that looked like it would fall off at any second.  I can feel the “junkie mode” that has taken over my being begin to weaken and slip away.  I know that within a matter of minutes, everything is going to be okay.  

My dealer is beginning to cross the field.  The closer he gets the more anxious I begin to feel.  He is only about a hundred yards away when the anxiety in me has reached its maximum capacity.  I feel sick.  I panic and open the door of my car, lean out spew a vile substance from my mouth.  “Fuck hurry up,” I think.  I look up to see my dealer standing there with a smirk on his face, probably wondering why I have a t-shirt wrapped about my face.  “Eyy dooo.   Dayuum, u muz not b feeln vury good,” he says in the gibberish gangster speak he calls English.  “You got that right man,” I say to him with spit dripping from my mouth.  “Here,” as I hand him a tightly rolled wad of cash.  In return I get my prescious bag of medicine.  With this bag I will rid myself of any feelings of sickness.  Any feelings of guilt, shame and despair that I may have been holding inside at that very moment would be gone in an instant.   I thank him for being quick and for not jerking me around today.  He turns and walks away probably thinking of drinking 40’s, smoking blunts and women with big asses.  Okay, that was kinda racist.  Or was it? 

 I quickly untie the baggie and pour a brown rock and some powder into the spoon.  I fill my rig with water and spray it gently onto the rock.  The water immediately changes from a clear liquid to a brown murky color.  I carefully smash the rock with the back side of my rig and stir till there are no more hard pebbles, only a swamp like pool of heaven .  With a click from the lighter,  a beautiful orange flame forms from seemingly nothing.   I heat the spoon for only a few seconds until the liquid turns from a dark cloudy brown to a light transparent color.  Throw in a cotton and the mixture is complete.  I draw the liquid up into the needle, making sure to get every last drop from the once soaking wet cotton.  I grab my seatbelt and wrap it tightly around my arm, holding it with my teeth.  My hand is shaky and I’m terrified that I may miss the vein and waste some of this precious liquid.  Alas, a plume of blood surges into the needle and I know that its ready.  I slowly push the plunger in, all the way in till there is nothing left.  As quickly as I can, I remove my arm from the tangled seatbelt and wait.  3…..2…..1…………….an orgasmic wave crashes through my body.  It races up my spine and into my brain.  It feels like millions of pins and needles are being pushed into my skull.  It hurts and feels so fucking good at the same time.  I can feel myself return to my normal state of being, “Junkie mode” has subsided and I sit there for a minute and forget about everything in the world.  Life is good for this moment.

i was so dizzy that i stumbled all over the place. i don't even know how i made it halfway across town. i called my ex to come help me cop and he came to help me. i couldn't stop shaking violently. i was sitting outside waiting for him to come back with the stuff when all of a sudden I'm convulsing and puking blood and not breathing all at the same time. and then I've got a crowd around me about to call an ambulance and i can't even talk to tell them not to do it. eventually my ex comes back and I'm trying to get up but i can't even lift myself off the ground. i couldn't stop gagging and puking and choking and I'm stumbling all over the street puking and walking. we finally manage to convince the crowd that I'm okay and to let us be. we find a good spot behind a church a couple of streets away in an alley. i ask him to prep my shit because I'm shaking too much. i also ask him to shoot me up because I'm shaking and can't stop puking. I'm trying not to move while puking at the same time he's injecting me. i try a point first to see how i feel. i still puke for about 5 minutes after the shot. i didn't feel anything other than feeling a tiny bit better so i prep another point and shoot that up. oh what a joyous miracle, i don't feel like I'm dying anymore.

as all this is going on my mom is texting me asking me if I'm okay. i finally make it home and explain to her what happened. she's sad and disappointed. i am too. we both really wanted this to work. i had been looking forward to this day for so long. i wanted to be off dope. i don't even have a backup plan in place, i was counting on this working so much. i really really really wanted it to go well. I'm not going to give up though, i will try this again next month.

they didn't even give me a script for methadone for that night even though they told me they would. i go to the pharmacy just for them to say that it looks like they changed their mind at the last second because they crossed the date out on the script. I'm supposed to start at 30ml tonight.

i almost don't even want to go back on methadone. I've been off it since friday. i almost think it would be easier to just detox off dope or even try the suboxone induction again but just switching from dope this time. 

i feel so depressed and hopeless. i feel like I'm never going to get off this crazy train. i feel like i keep digging myself into a deeper hole. i don't want to live like this anymore. i want to be clean. i feel like such a chicken shit. I'm angry with myself.

i love you mom. thanks for being there for me. thanks for giving me money so i could get well before i went into a goddamn seizure. thanks for being understanding about the whole situation and finally seeing that i do want to get off dope and that i have been trying. i just wish i could make you proud and make myself proud.


edit: just wanna say thank you to everyone for all the support, i really appreciate it a lot. i really felt like such a loser having to come back here and tell you all that it didn't work for me yesterday. i wanted to be able to say that it worked and not to give up hope and all these nice words of encouragement that if i can do it you can do it too, etc. but it doesn't always work out that way. it's not always easy the first time. but I'm not giving up. I've worked so hard to get where i am today. i went from being a crack/heroin addict and homeless in winter to back at home, in school and working part time. you just need to want it badly enough. you have to genuinely be done with the dope lifestyle. even writing this makes me cry because i wanted it so badly for myself and i let myself give up.",1407379923.0

We were only allowed to smoke 3 times a day, 2 cigs each time. We had to give the butts back to the nurses and they kept everyone's packs and lighters. Anyway, my GF snuck me in a pack and a lighter. She was amazing at that type thing. I took them back to my room and hid them. There were 2 hallways, one for ladies and one for guys. Every 2 rooms shared a bathroom. I luckily had no one sharing with me due to an open bed. When I took a shower I let it run forever and steamed it up. I smoked a couple nervously and stashed them. It was nearing time for them to check vitals and I became paranoid. I knew it reeked like smoke. My mind raced. How could I cover the smell?  I came up with the idea to pour my mint flavored mouthwash into the heat/air unit in my room. I dumped it in there and cranked the fan. Much to my surprise it kind of worked. But now it smelled like a fucking candy cane factory in my room which was worse. I became so paranoid that I tore the cigs and pack up and flushed them and snuck the lighter into the trash. No one said anything about smelling smoke or mouthwash so it was all in my head most likely.

I've been addicted to other things before, the biggest one was coke for about two years, and most of us know how strong a nicotine addiction is, but there's something so much darker about a heroin addiction. Opiates are classified as downers and that's how they'll make you feel- down. Half an hour into a dope ride I almost feel like I'm drifting into hell, but of course as I'm drifting, I'm swaddled in a warm, fuzzy down feather comforter, making my descent into darkness the most pleasurable thing I've ever experienced. 

However, anyone willing to cross that line in the first place isn't going to want to do it just once. That place feels way to damn great, but you only get to *want* to do it again once or twice, after that you HAVE to go back. 

My life isn't horrible, compared to a lot of people I'm actually quite a fortunate individual, but in reality, my life is pointless. I have a job, a girlfriend and a few friends (only a few know about any of this, and not the girlfriend), but once I'm gone, the earth is going to keep turning like it always has. I'm not crippled by this realization, and I'm not going to spend my life trying to make sure that when I die I will have impacted the world in any kind of great way. I don't know if it's because I'm just lazy, or if I just really don't care, however, I have my addiction. 

To normal people, this seems fucked up and maybe some would say that I need help or that I need to talk to someone professional about it (which I have for years, but I always end up back here), but my addiction is what keeps me going. I am locked incredibly tightly in the grips of heroin, and it drives me to do most of what I do. I love get up in the morning so I can get high, I work so I can support my habit, also a place to live, giving me a comfortable place to get high and escape from everything. Most importantly though, addiction gives me something to care about. Even if I don't have a choice, drugs occupy my mind and give me things to think about other than what's directly in front of me, but most obvious is the high. 

Dwindling on the edge of consciousness, taking me away to a comfortable place where I can dwell and focus on how I feel right at that moment and nothing else. Shutting out anything and everything from the outside world until it's time to dose up again. This is my favorite way to feel because this is, in my opinion, is how I *deserve* to feel. I'm chained to this feeling, unable to escape if I wanted to, as these are hard chains to break, but I chose these chains, they are mine.

Get out of shower and chew up 40mg of oxycodone. My entire day's worth. 20 minutes later shaved, dressed, enjoying a cigarette and sprite to settle my still queasy stomach.

But feel so much better. I've been doing this for years now. I'm not ""high"". I'm not nodding. I've been able to hold the same dosage for 2 years now and it manages my pain well. I do up my dose for the more enjoyable high, especially on refill days or if I can score some extra. I will be able to go to work today and be productive. This new job is higher stress, but higher pay and I've been getting great feedback from my managers and co-workers in the 6 month's I've been there.

Just tired of being judged and looked down upon because of something that really helps me get through the day. 4 years ago I was looking at going on disability and spent months unemployed in bed or on the toilet, living in my parents house because I had no income and was on medicaid. Withdrawals are similar to my flare-ups. I've been back in the workforce 2 years and now am working an great job in my field of interest. 

I know everyone on here takes opiates for different reasons, but we are all seeking some release from pain..the pain of sobriety, life, health problems, withdrawals, etc. Just wish it wasn't so looked down upon when it allows me to live a normal life.
/end rant.

TLDR. Oxy saved my day again and I'm about to go to work and kick ass because of I'm on 40mg with 2mg of klonopin to kick it up a little.

It was half against my will. Frankly it was a waste of time for me because I got high the day after getting out. 
The more I look back the more pissed off I get at all the money I wasted by being there. Therapy was a joke. The rules pisses me off: no internet, no computers, no cell phones, no TV, no video games. The only entertainment was a small collection of movies full of mediocre titles of various genres. We were not allowed to bring our own movies. We were not allowed to listen to music except for pre-approved radio stations. It felt like I was fucking 10 again - not being able to listen to music or watch TV with ""bad words"" or sex in it? Fuck that shit... 

The rationale was that we should be focused on our recovery. We were assigned strict schedules and given chores to teach us ""structure."" Electronics were frowned upon and we were encouraged to entertain ourselves by socializing (as a heavy introvert this was fucking hell and I spent days just sitting on the couch staring outside my brain frozen because honestly I just can't fucking socialize more than maybe an hour a day)

Part of the reason I use opiates - in fact, the main reason is that life bores me. Nothing in life excites me besides opiates. If I want to recover then it is necessary for me to find a way to love life without sticking a needle into myself. In this sense the rehab did more harm than good because I was BORED AS FUCK and sure as hell was not finding ways to enjoy life without drugs.

Therapy sort of was interesting but not worth the money.

Anyway I am pissed off at my experience. But I was put there against my will as a diversion against a drug charge. If I were serious about recovery it would be individual therapy and getting back into my hobbies like video games and fishing and hiking. Sitting in a house where everything fun is forbidden and therapy is just about making us hate our family sure as fuck isn't going to help me recover

I work part time as a mcdonalds crew member making minimum wage. The rest of my days are spent smoking lots of weed. I play guitar and write music but hate the music buisness to try that route. I used to be a heavy opiate addict but now i only chip. I had only two best friends bc everybody else is too strung out or in jail. One just got sent to rehab and the other is caught up with his girl and his son. 

I feel so alone but i'm happy. I'm truly happy to have money in my pocket. You see, my mom passed away about 3 years ago. Cancer. It started there by taking her high powered oxycotin and dilaudid. She eventually passed and I was stuck. Was stealing money to fight the withdrawals and boredom. I hit rock bottom when i got robbed for $500 of other peoples money in a bad deal. I got clean for 4 months by moving away to my super religous zealot grandmas.

When i got back I started chippin. Been doing it for a year and a half. It's not the easiest thing but it can be done. My worst day now is better than my best day back then. I'm alone but its for the best. I dont know if I could do it without weed or drinking though. I feel like everybody has vices they use to cope with life and get through the day. The only thing i absolutly fucking hate are drug tests. I could prolly advance myself if I didn't have to deal with that bullshit. Anyways happy nods everybody. Just getting things off my chest with my favorite sub(I lurk constantly, great commuinty)

P.S. Im gonna hit y'all up with some acoustic opiate music soon. Been writing a lot of music lately and it's becoming a passion of mine. Would love to find some bandmates around 336 area that gets fucked up and jams :)

Then last second got someone who should be able to get some shit, we go pick them up and have to drive pretty far(it's getting a bit late at this point and the other redditor had to work and shit so it was shitty) then get told to drive somewhere else and shit.  So we finally get the shit and of course it's not in bombs, it's just powder in a cellophane and we have to split it up plus give the person who came with us a little.  So I decided to take a little bit and do a shot to see how it was, get high and judge how much I should give the middleperson.  Didn't think I put much in at all but maybe some slipped out or something and it was more than I realized because when i did it i got a nice rush and was worried for a sec but didn't fall out right away.  I remember being impressed though like damn, this is pretty good, I didn't put much in at all so I put a small amount of dope in the cap for the other person.  Thought I remembered this very clearly but apparently not because that's pretty much right when i fell out.

Next thing I know I wake up and had no idea anything was wrong at all, the people I was with were freaking out a bit but I definitely wasn't really aware that anything bad had happened, I thought I just nodded for a couple minutes.  I guess it turns out I was completely unresponsive, started making strange noises, turning purple and shit and they were going to drive me to the hospital i think but then ended up stopping and calling an ambulance from a store(no phones working of course lol) but I guess I woke up while they were on the way and we dipped in time.  So I got back home, feeling fine but unaware that anything really had happened, I didn't find out until later when the middleman was describing what happened with detail that it really scared me.  I was damn close and if they hadn't been there to slap me and try to wake me up and shit I could have easily died.  I haven't been using very often, not even enough to have withdrawal yet so it's tough sometimes to judge, especially in a dark car at night when you only have one big bag of shit and not little ones that are easy to judge.

so anyway, I get home and realize I only have $20 and I should have at least 100.  I knew the money situation wasn't sorted out though at all because i had essentially paid for it all and then gotten very little dope to bring home but considering the circumstances and time and shit I figured I would just get it today.  Then this morning I hit up the redditor like yo homie need that cash i left in your car plus more and some more dope and he was like there was no cash in my car.  I'm like thats impossible, it wasn't in my house and i definitely had it in your car right before.  He was like no man you can check  I swear, then said he had seen a bunch of bills sticking out of my pocket as i got out.  So I was like fuck, I'm like 95% sure this dude wouldn't try to fuck me over but it kind of sounded like a convenient thing to say too.  But I went outside on the offchance maybe it had fallen out on the way up the stairs to my house.  There was a single 20 laying in the gutter in front of my house.  I was like oh shit, it really was out here, looked around and found 60 more for a total of 80(everything I was missing) spread out in the street.  This was like 10 hours later too.

So all in all, I didn't die, didn't get hit with narcan/hospital bill, found all my money and got a new connect.  Not bad.",1407433781.0

But anyways story goes I had a tonsillectomy a little over 3 weeks ago.  I was prescribed oxycodone (percocets) and tramadol.  I got a tramadol refill, but not a oxy one as its ""to addictive"".  From the 11th-13th day post op I stopped the tramadol (11th was the last of my oxy).  I should note I abused the oxys here and there on purpose (took 4-5x 5mg a few times) to get high, keep in mind this is my first time on opiates.  Between the 11th-13th I noticed:

-diarrhea
-running nose + watery eyes (to a much lesser extent)
-restless leg - by far the worst symptom - I was unable to sleep 
-felt like I was coming up on a flu

 On the 13th day post surgery I bled, lost 2-3 pints of blood and needed to be put under and recauterized and whatnot.

In the hospital I was administered some opiates (hydromorphone, morphine).  But this was ""responsible"" amounts by nurses and only for one night.

I was prescribed tramadol but not oxy, which I thought was bullshit as I was suffering infact more pain than when I had my tonsillectomy.  I continued with the tramadol.  At one point I injested 4 percs (5mg) from a friend but this didn't stop the pain like before (because it was a different type of pain - refered pain - my ears hurt like a fucking bitch, like under pressure.  A much different pain than the ""normal"" throat pain I had from my tonsilectomy.  With percs after I fews when I took a bunch I'd be able to eat food.  Not this time as I got sharp pain/pressure in my ear irregardless.  Anyways I don't know why I'm writing about this as its pointless, but im baked + took 150mg tramadol at once broken up.


Anyways to continue - I continued to take the prescribed tramadol as it kind of helped with the ""normal"" pain in my throat just like during the tonsillectomy. 

Last night on the 9th day post recauterization I decided not to take tramadol as it wasn't doing shit for the weird pain which kept me from eating.


For 24 hrs roughly.  This time I experienced:

-diarrhea
-watery nose + watering eyes (less extent)
-flu like feeling
-being extremely cold, I woke up and took a bath.  And was about to take a second but someone called and I had to head out.
-to early to tell about RLS as when I smoked weed I decided fuck it and took 150 mg tramadol like 2 hrs ago.
-depressed feeling - i tend to be mildy depressed sometimes less, sometimes more. i know this ""feeling well"" I was noticeably ""more depressed"" today

Anyways thinking of going cold turkey tomorrow.  Or maybe I should taper with the last of my pills/wait till I can eat more than chicken noodle soup.

Thoughts? Overall fuck tramadol - barely ""feel"" anything.  I could see myself doing oxy 1-2x a year though its pretty enjoyable and that infrequently should do anything bad.

My GP gave me 2 120ct 5/325 hydrocodone bottles and a script for cyclobenzaprine (which I hate, a lot). He referred me to a pain management facility, one that my parents had already talked about and my grandmother as well. Apparently the Pain Doc. there and his partner are some of the best, renowned pain specialists in the state. After talking to him on the phone regarding our first meet up, I explained to him in thorough detail my experience with meds in the past and how my current script of hydrocodone is doing absolutely nothing for me. He says ""well, that's unfortunate, if you feel that they are not working for you, hold out until your appointment, it may seem that you aren't able to get an adequate dose of hydrocodone before reaching your limit for the day. It's not that hydrocodone doesn't work for you, it may just be you aren't getting the right, dosage of it. Tylenol is a really nasty drug and shouldn't be in these pain drugs at all, it's extremely lethal in high doses and kills so many innocent people just trying to relieve their pain each year.""

Well, after getting off of the phone with him, after a little more talking, my dad calls me and says, ""Hey did you talk to your pain doctor yet about the appointment? Apparently he's worked with your grandma and both of your great aunts and currently has them on a form of hydrocodone with *NO APAP*"" I kind of played stupid here, asking questions, saying i'd never heard of anything like that before. He says ""It's worked phenomenally well for them and their conditions and since we are related, it may work just as well for me.""

Time is of essence, it is relative to every living and non-living thing: Alive or Dead. 

Dead, that's exactly where I would be if it weren't for many things. Heroin is one of them.

 I remember when I first tried heroin, I even remember my favorite place to get high. That is what I'm going to talk about. 
    The isolated spot with decayed lifeless tree branches holding a place for me to sit. Sitting there just as lifeless until I fixed my hit. Seconds later it all became anything but lifeless. I would enjoy the time spent alone reflecting on how I came so low. How I became a heroin junkie. The friends and family I had hurt along the way, it all came back. And it hurt, it hurt so damn much, until I inhaled a little more tar of sticky substance, then it was all wiped away with a gasp of bitter, vinegar like taste. There was one of those free public library like stands where you could take a book or leave one. I decided to take, much like most things at that time. I didn't take a book however, I found a dog toy placed inside it. I thought this would make a great gift for my beloved dog whom I'd willfully neglected to get my fix for the evening. Remembering this only made my feelings come back, it was time to smoke some more. With the awful thought of my dog and dog food, it reminded me of heroin.

2d0cbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2d0cbm/questions/,5,https://redd.it/2d0cbm,_trouble_clef_,Questions,"Hi there. I hope the following questions do not come off as offensive or intrusive. They come from a place of unadulterated curiosity. For some background, I am a recreational drug user with some, though not extensive, opiate experience. However, I have always been incredibly curious about opiates and opiate addiction. 

I was wondering what reactions any of you had to people like myself who are intrigued, though not necessarily enticed, by the lifestyle of an addict. It isn't so much about an eagerness to try any particular drug, rather a sort of voyeuristic attraction to it all. Is there anger, as if you feel objectified? Is there concern, as perhaps others experienced this before making certain decisions? Do you not care at all? Also, is there anything that you, as an individual user or a representative of a community, wish you had the opportunity to make clear to the non-using public? Anything about your lifestyle that you would like to make known? Misconceptions that you'd like to clear up? 

I'm honestly just interested in any response anyone is willing to give (about things I've asked or anything else, really) as I've long lurked this sub and assumed it would be a safe place to start a dialogue. If I am wrong in that assumption, please let me know. Thanks!",1407526874.0

2d591g,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2d591g/a_deal_is_made/,42,https://redd.it/2d591g,SWPA,A deal is made.,"So there sat Jacob on the edge of his truck bed. A smooth, orange bottle of hydrocodone rolling peacefully around in his palm. He happened across them helping the neighbor lady clean out her attic.  There were about a dozen left. The bottle states they are 10/325 hydrocodone , inside they look so happy, the color of sunshine.  

Jacob knew what they were, just last year when he had his wisdom teeth removed he had his own bottle. Even though he took them exactly as prescribed, he remembered how they made him feel. So good, so social, they turned life into a party and he was the gracious host. 

So he dropped the bottle into his pocket and finished up the work he had started with the neighbor.   Later that evening, he sat alone in his bedroom admiring the bottle as it rolled from one hand to other. The seductive sound of its contents tumbling back and forth.   After a few moments he opened the bottle. Dumped three into the palm of his hand. He grabbed the bottle of water from his nightstand and washed them down his throat. 

Within a minute the devil appeared before him. The devil asked Jacob if he was ready to make a deal  ""A deal? "" said Jacob. ""What kind of deal"".  The devil replied that Jacob had in his possession the key to happiness. Not just it's my birthday kind of happiness, but the kind of happiness that shall permeate every inch of your body. It was the kind of happiness one felt once in a lifetime. However Jacob could have that all day, every day. Well said Jacob, nothing is for free so what's the catch?  At that the devil laughed and said there is no catch. Just stop taking them and that will end your happiness. Now, the devil explained, in order to achieve this happiness constantly you must take more and stronger ones.

So Jacob thought about it and right before the devil disappeared Jacob stopped him. ""I have a question."" Said Jacob. Go on said the devil...  Jacob says  ""If I stop taking them and that happiness leaves me how do I get it back?""  Well said the devil you have two choices. First find more happiness in an opiate and take them, or secondly if you are unable to find any opiates or decide to stop taking them permanently you must know the following. All happiness earned through your habit must be paid back in misery. Also since that misery has been accrued over time there is interest. Figure about 100% interest.   Once this debt has been paid back, then life returns to regular up and downs. Neither too happy nor too sad. 

So Jacob finished the bottle in two days.  He has been accruing misery ever since.  Occasionally, he will go a day or two off, and he begins paying back that debt of misery. But this is like bailing out the Titanic with a thimble.   Once he finds his DOC though he goes full steam ahead just building that debt. Oftentimes he wonders, if I died today, would I get out of this debt I owe.  I would never have to pay it back.   That is exactly the thought process going through his head two days later when he pushes off the fattest shot ever and drifts up among the clouds. Never to return to the family and friends that watched the 12 month process of Jacob becoming an addict.  They are the ones that felt helpless to stop him as he careened out of control.  

The debt of misery, still not payed back, is distributed to the people who loved Jacob. For they ultimately pay it back with interest as they plant their 22yr old son/grandson/friend in the ground. They will carry that a long time. They will miss the Jacob that helped the neighbor lady when she needed it. They will miss his moody mornings before school. They will miss his laugh and smile. They will bear the burden of paying back Jacob's hard earned misery. 

In the end it is a deal made, and if you want the happiness the misery will be paid back ... with interest. ",1407677601.0

Well just as I was about to I stopped and thought this must be a dream, like when you win a bunch of money and then wake up, but I brushed it off as nonsense since it seemed so real.  Went to open the little packet it was in and bam, I wake up in my bed and reality sets in.

I gave up and shot the shot up my nose. Tonight I attempt again with an without a tourniquet. I can hardly ever really feel the veins, but I do see them. Everytime I try to register, first of all my grip on the rig is terrible and sometimes the rig turns in my skin. When I pull back to register I get nothing but vacuum. I keep doing this, added a tourniquitee to help find new veins i hadnt trie yet, but all in all, 
I frustratingly only get a little bit of blood. One time I know I hit the win because blood trickled out when I removed the syringe!

Anyways, this was my first attempt at a vein not in the crook of my arm, it was about 3 inches up my arm and I could see it well but still couldn't feel it great. I stick it in and pull back and the plunger seemed to come up a bit, the solution was already bloody so I couldn't tell for sure, but I thought I registered but wasn't sure. Anyways, by this point I wasn't gonna try again, my arms already look noticably poked after ~10 attempts two nights, and this was the closest I have seemed to get to registering, so I said fuck it and shot it.


I did feel high almost immediately, but I wasted a little dope getting all the air bubbles out after subsequent tries. So no ""rush"" I don't think, but I felt it immediately and a normal opioid high creeped up on me over 5-10 minutes (I put the cotton in my mouth for buccal absorption so maybe that's why). So the first thing I notice is the spot is itching like crazy afterwards and almost burning feeling. It got a little red and after about 5 minutes what looks like a welp (spelling?) from an allergic reaction. The first time I ever tried IV a year ago, I registered perfectly, then my shaky hands lost the vein and I missed half the shot in my arm. Then a big bump came up, but I do not think this is like this. Because of thVe immediate effect, I think I did hit the vein but idk. 

Are histamine reactions common at the spot of IV? If not I guess I did miss. But whatever, I am still higher than I woulda been had I snorted that amount.

Anyways, please guys help me get this right! I am having a god aweful time in my life and only have a little dope to help me through it. ",1407642454.0

Alright I have a good job and I meet new people in the community all the time. I've worked there a good amount of time too,  Now if you were to Google search my name in the images section, my fucking mugshot pops up staring at you. What's worse here is it was from charges that were eventually dropped. What happened to innocent until proven guilty?  Who the fuck are these people that put a terrible mugshot up on the internet, then claim to erase it if you pay THEM $149.99?  Isn't that extortion?  The fucking shit of it all!  It reminds me of some piece of shit who puts out a little paper you can buy at any convenient store called, ""Jailbirds!  Your weekly guide to the area's criminals."" 

It sounds terrible but it's like our modern day freakshow. It's wrong to gawk at people, but there's always an us and them complex. Well here these people get to think everyone on that damn paper or internet picture is a criminal. Automatic stigma attached.

2 am, took 50mg more, feeling even more amazing...but its not giving me the nods that I desire from oxy. its now 2 30 and im taking 100mg more. Feeling the best ive ever felt off any opiate ever and I have abused oxy 30's. having the time of my life. I throw up but wow, sweet fucking relief from nausea.

4 am and im nodding harder than I ever have, double vision, cant keep eyes open, but if i want to i can stand up and walk around pretty decently (just not today) but man dem nodz were sooo nice. I go up stairs and prepare for a good nod session with 50mg more (300mg total dose) and when i nod i start hearing these very particular auditory hallucinations, like off tune guitar strings or electrical off tune noises sort of tingly or water rushing through my ear, and other beeps. each guitar string pulled tickles my brain and makes me so happy and good feeling.

I find this image of junkie as the problem of society really resembles that of the hysterics in the late 1800s.For example the users narrative of their own character is suppressed,only that which 
is conducive to the outright vilification
is presented and heard.Drug users are now almost the devil's servants of the old world,people are spoken of as if entirely possessed,powerless,basically held at the whim of the drug(devil) which is often give personification in the description as being a evil seductress woman or the devil.(figures, right?)

I think this is dated idea has been incorporated into societies view of addiction overall.Insidiously re-enforcing the narrative of possession and moral decay,we never effectively purged the old idea just modernized it.
It does nothing more than mystify,demonize and repress the addict.Addicts are the modern day ship of fools,or hysterics. members of society that are unfit and dangerous and must be repressed and thrown away.The addict can not even be allowed to speak as he is possessed and insane so it's his insanity speaking.

What getting is the inhumanity of past treatment of the mental ill is still
quite real.The power of the institutions here leave the addict unable to advocate for themselves as they are insane(thus they speaking from insanity),they are powerless to drugs (thus lacking human decency,thus a threat to society)

Basically addicts are overall repressed in medicine,psychology,psychiatry,the legal system and society as a whole.",1407755244.0

Thank fucking god i have finally found a combination of drugs that satiates my 10 year long intense poly drug addiction. Like most people here I've tried about every drug under the sun. Last year a settled on a diet of heroin cocaine and booze to treat my lifelong mental issues. Well that promptly destroyed my life so I reached out to my dr to get help. That process was also a nightmare but here I am, four months later, clean as I've been in a long ass time ( no illegal drugs here officer! ) and finally on a set of medications that not only work, but allow me a happy productive life (which i feel we all deserve ). 

Wellbutrin for add/depression 

Neurontin for anxiety 

Suboxone for tendency to inject drugs 

And clonidine for sleep.

My biggest worry was the suboxone. Is this like methadone I wondered? Am I gonna be a slave to this for the rest of my life? Will I ever use the bathroom again.


The answer was kinda yea and nay. I have almost zero sides. My doctor did a hormone test and my test level was around 700 from what couldn't have been more then zero from when I was on dope. I have no issue going to the bathroom daily and I've put on 15 pounds of muscle. At the same time I gotta wonder why I'm not sick. Not just the physical shit but the pure mental agony of wanting to check out of the shithole I had created for myself. Everyday I've filled that hole and now my life is finally looking ok. Yes, ok. Not gonna lie and say wonderful but for someone like me ok is a huge fucking accomplishment 


 I don't get at all why I hear someone are taking suboxone to get high or  feel miserable and like a junky. Where are the opiate side effects? I take 8mg and want to ween down to. 4mg by Xmas (if I can). Is it because I did so much before that my body is so accustomed it reached homeostasis? Does sub just not carry all the sides because of it's partial blocking of the receptors?


Lots of love, HAPPY nods, and if you want a different life you don't need to run away, there is absolute hope. Fortune favors the patient. I'm not the perfect recovery bot (tm) but my deep desire for complete sobriety paying off. Wasn't sure that's what I wanted at first but now I see my friends who just drink or smoke weed and am not interested.


Someone on here said don't look back in a year on today and wish you started what you have been putting off. That inspired me a lot. I hopped off reddit and got on my weights, guitar and journal. This place will always be a part of me. On all my different accounts I've been on here for 3 + years from the very start of my hydro Kratom and tramadol addiction to my absolute worst. 1/10 would not reccomend.

Summer going into my senior year of college (UConn for those that care) I meet a regular at work and take up an offer to smoke a blunt with him. Little did I know everything after that day was going to change forever. I came over and smoked on my break. I work at walgreens aka the easiest job ever. Whilst smoking I heard his wife's life story. She chilled with us and was very sweet. She said she just beat leukemia and was prescribed Dilly's 4mg. I had never heard of them so he gave me two. I took one with water and that was it, I fell in love again (first time was with my girlfriend). Anyway I slowly started getting more and more, cheap as fuck too like buy 10 for $25 and get 1 free. Fast forward a year later, someone stole them from his house (not me) and he stopped getting the script. I found out what withdrawals were the next day. To be honest I couldn't believe how awful it was. I was shitting and puking with no appetite, my legs and back were killing me and there was no way in hell I could study. Im a long time reader of this amazing thread and decided I needed suboxone. I was getting 4mg strips and then 8mg. I began to taper but after about 3 months of taking less than 1.5 mg a day, I was bored and was interested in h. I got it from a god awful connect for 60 a bun and more than half taken out. I didn't know better at the time. This bitch named Jack gave me 8mg strips cut in half for $1 a mg (actually $2 a mg when I found out I was paying for an 8mg strip and only getting four). Well fast forward to about a month ago, whether by a miracle or Satan's devine intervention, I got a good, no wait, an amazing connect. Thank you Hartford CT lmao. Anyway I need to quit. I can't be hooked forever I need to quit it all. I've saved like 10 sub strips. How should I quit. The wd from the subs aren't a walk in the park. What is kratom like and should I take subs with it?

He said he was good, but I get there and he says he had just sold his last three bags. Fuck. So I call this dude that I hate dealing with (because his shit is usually awful) and he says he has both and he's right down the street from my other dudes house. So we make the walk and I give him the forty bucks, 20 for the boy and 20 for the girl. When I get it it's in two corner bags and I can see that they both have a white substance in them. He can see my quizzical expression and says, ""it's white boy, ask Timmy, it's good. Trust me."" Famous last words.

So anyway we get back and I look at Timmy and I say, ""is this dope? I mean I tasted it and it's bitter like boy, but I don't want to put anything in my vein that isn't dope."" Timmy replies, ""it's china white. Granted it's got cut on it, but it's the real deal.""

So we smoke the girl first as I'm reluctant to try this boy, but when we were done I fixed a half of a point shot and Jesus Christ if that wasn't some of the best boy I've had in a minute.

Now I'm headed back to work to close and I've got another shot left for the morning.

So I broke my rule and started taking it during the day as well as before bed due to depression....their only 2.60 USD a bar so its actually a habit I can maintain financialy as long as I dont treat myself to much else.

But yeah from what I hear benzo withdrawl is bad; and I've noticed I've been getting really agitated, almost angry and severely depressed when not under the influence now. That sought of depression like im not sucidial but I dont really see a point in going on kind of thing; which I know is silly. 

But yeah, depression aside, how long does it take for you to get addicted to xanax if your taking roughly 100mg every 10 days? I't took 3 months of me IV'ing heroin to get withdrawls so I figure i'll be ok for awhile but figured its better to be safe and check.

Also FML, so wish there were some Aussies here I could just meet up for a beer with; not having any friends in my state is getting me real down and xanax seems like the only thing keeping me alive. 

Dont mean to get all heavy, and yeah I probably have a substance abuse problem but i'm not ready to quit drugs, I like drugs, I just want my friends back, or new ones.

So, I'm 11 days off all opiates. My drug of choice was Oxy. For the past 2 years I'd been taking super small doses (10-20mg) one night every few weeks. then I broke my back and started using approx 50mg every day for two months.

Had reasonable withdrawals. Nothing terrible. Sickness, shits, pains, chills...the usual suspects.

Weird thing is, they still haven't gone away. They've reduced, but I still get bouts of all of them and pretty much constant muscle aches and tiredness. Way worse at nights.

Is this normal?

Would I set myself back if I used again just to have some relief and get some sleep? I'm not talking nodding out all day....just 10mg for a couple of nights.

This is a true story of what just happened to me and a fellow redditor in dorchester, ma (typical 'hood' if you're not familiar with it). So since we're both white, and on foot, obviously we stick out, and it's obvious why we're there. So my friend waits at the train station whilst I walk to meet my connect. I get in his car then get out and walk back to meet up. I put the shit in my sock, as I assumed it would be safest there. So my friend and I are looking for bathrooms, or places to do it in. 

After looking for a few places, we're now standing outside this church where they're doing work on. We were contemplating whether or not we should like ask to use the bathroom there, when this typical looking undercover BPD drug cop (imo sorta looked like hank from breaking bad lmao) approaches us, showing the badge, and is getting right to the point. He said he seen me get in the car and come out and shit, and idk if I could believe him, so we kept quiet at first. He played the typical ''if you just tell me where it is, you're not going to jail'' shit. He told me I was under arrest already for the ''residue in my cap'' (that I used to mix my dope shots previously). He read me my rights and shit. 

Neither of us were in cuffs or anything. He told me to take my shoes off. So I figured he's gonna find it, and all of my other options were exhausted at this point (that I knew of and were applicable right now), so I just gave it to him, hoping he'd stick to his word. So he asked me a few more questions, gave some info like my name and parents' name and ssn, etc. He told me I'd be getting a court summons in the mail, and he gave me his personal phone number and told him to call him in a few days. He was sorta douchey, but didn't seem like he really wanted to put some addicts in jail over petty BS. 

Anyway, I'm asking your opinion... would you have done the same? Granted, I know I should have had it hidden better, but considering I was already 'under arrest', and if taken in, it probably would have been found anyway. I considered making use of that copblock/flexing my rights shit, but with this cop it seemed like it def woulda just pissed him off more and made it worse for us than just complying.

My  wonderful gf and I went half on it. She was doing subutex for almost 2 years before we began dating. That's all we usually do but when we can't find any we get opana bc that's what my guy only has all the time. When we got the 30 I broke off about half. I've been doing opana for almost 2 years so it takes more to get me feeling right and her less cause she is fairly new. 

Later that night we both agreed to save the other half for the next day because we knew we couldn't get anything. Right before bed I decided to break down the half for the next day. Pretty much just teasing my self, shuffling around the fine powder into two equal lines with my license. My gf walked in on me and asked why I was doing that. I told her I was just getting it ready for tomorrow. She went to bed before me but before I did I wanted to look at the glorious panda lines I made. I then remembered she didn't need as much as me also I really didn't want her to on my level and be bad off. Without thinking and being tired as fuck I just decided to combine the lines back together and deal with it tomorrow. 

The next motherfucking morning she wakes up before me to go to work. She does her normal routine and even gives me a kiss on the forehead before heading out the door. I wake up about an hour later trying to Tell myself ""hold off till 6! Hold off till 6"" and not even look at the panda because I will want some. Before I even get out of bed I get this long ass message from her saying that she went ahead and did her line and asked if we can get more.... I totally freak out. Threw my phone in the backyard! She pretty much domed a 15mg. I told her and she just kept saying ""I'm sorry, im sorry, I didn't know, I'll get us more!"" She's hard of hearing and I had to remind her how it was going to be dry. Man oh man I wanted to just cry. Tried hitting up anyone I knew but nothing. All I could do was take lope and wait 3 days.. That's like 3 days in the hyperbolic time chamber! What's the longest you had to wait for the drought to be over? I don't think I can remember the last time I've gone this long without anything up my nose.

Some of the best #4 afghan heroin i have ever recieved. This stuff is top notch, it smells delicious with a hint of AA, and goes up the nose cleanly. I haven't IV'd it yet, i will do so tonight, but it's great. It's pricey, but it's the purest dope i have ever gotten. Slices through Suboxone like butter after only being off of it yesterday and today. Today was a good fucking day though.

In my town, there is only one store to buy syringes. It's a grocery store in the hood. I went to buy my usual 10 pack of 31 gauge shorts yesterday and they turned me down. They told me they implemented a new policy last week that they will no longer be selling syringes without a prescription, because they are tired of making people think it's okay and acceptable to be drug addicts. I went hardcore on the lady that said this to me. I bitched for a solid five minutes before being made to leave. She made my blood boil. My state doesn't have a law about syringes, you can buy as many as you want without a prescription. Well today, i got my precious heroin in my mailbox. I instantly went in search of syringes. CVS, Walgreens.. All of them gave me an attitude and told me i had to have a prescription for rigs, and told me it's illegal to buy them without one. I skipped the arguing today and just left pissed off. I give up, snort my H and get fucking nodded. Oh well i thought. Ima have to buy them off the internet again and wait a week, and chances are i won't have this beautiful batch by then. 

I needed food, so i went to walmart in my side of town (the nice side). I saw their pharmacy and i was like, y'know what? Fuck it. It's worth a shot. I waited in line for like 15 minutes, and got to the counter. I asked the lady for a box of 31 gauge shorts, and she immediately asked me what CC i wanted. I felt like i had hit the jackpot. Told her 1/2 and she got me a box and it only cost 13$ fucking bucks. My old place i bought rigs was 3.50 for a 10 pack. I had a bullshit convo with the lady about having a diabetic dog, and she told me that she never realized how many pets were diabetic until she started working the pharmacy, and she winked at me. This bitch knows what i'm doing. :P Oh well. I got GREAT dope, and a new place to buy rigs at a CHEAP price! Today has been a good day. Any of yall score today?

Also a thought i had.. I've seen a few people on here make posts where they type like their barred out or insanely fucked up.. But they were able to type the captcha correctly to post it. It just took me 5 times to type the captcha correctly, and i'm not even nodded anymore. :P",1407785667.0

I was in the process of getting him a job. I called him from my work and told him to get a shower and come through. 45 minutes go by and I call to find out his ETA and now he sounds like he just did 2 bags and popped a bar. Well that's what he did. I tell him that my boss is leaving that he'll call him tomorrow. 
2 hours go by and I get a call from him. ""Dude my parents caught me and Stacy high as fuck and they're sending me too rehab. Can you spot me a pack of cigs till I get out."" I do so. So I see him and Stacy coming up the road but they pass my work kinda. They're sitting at the light, I see both of them dipping out super hard, she jolts awake and slams on her gas and slams straight into the truck in front of her. I'm just smoking a cig thinking ""Jesus Christ"" and wave them all in so they're not jammin up the lane. Guys truck was good but her front end was trashed. He knew they were ""stoned"" and didn't get the cops involved.
 She's crying and he's just burning a hole in his pants dipped the fuck out. Being that I work at a service station I pull the car near the garage and start looking under the hood to make sure there wasn't much damage if any. All the while they're both super dipped out. He wakes up sort of, grabs my money than grabs cigs. ""He's using me like he always has. Using me for a place to sleep, a place to do your drugs that I consistently buy but never get repaid. He's the friend who pinched your bag every time he middles for you or straight up stole bags. Same guy who sold your iphone and still Denys it to this day.""
 Always against my better judgement I help him out and look past his scum fuckery. My mom pulls up and she treated this kid like one of her own. Sees how wrecked he is and speaks her mind. He not only told my mom to fuck off, he acted she never did shit. I get done with the car and explain shit to Stacy. He walks up into my store and screams ""stay the fuck out of my life you scum bag."" After telling him to fuck off he try's to come at me with this insane look in his eye. THAT'S how I knew the little bit of the best friend that I used to know was totally lost to drugs. A friendship died today. There will be no memorial service. There will be 0 regrets. There will be 0 sympathy. There will only be a lonely junkie.",1407906998.0

I cop a good amount of dope and start doing it around 7pm. So 11pm roles around and I'm high and need to urinate. I try to go for 10 minutes but no matter how hard a strain nothing came out. Little frustrating but I have had it happen before so I go back to sleep. Wake up this morning and I really need to pee. Go try again push strain change position run warm water over penis and nothing. I'm worried now but I figure time will help the drug wear off. So I try periodically all morning and still get nothing. But now i have to go so bad it hurts. So at 2pm I reluctantly drive myself to the walk in the doc. The reception nurse tells me I need to go to ER after listening to me and seeing my swollen stomach. 

So I drive to ER. It's been 14 hours since my last dose and I'm not high in the slightest. I go in the ER bathroom and try some more. Nothing fuck! So I sign in the crowded ER after 5 min triage nurse calls me over I tell her what's up leaving out the heroin part of course and she says ""your going back right now hunny"". I get back and immediately I hear the catheter word fuck. I was scared but also in pain so I said ""do what you gotta do"". So began the most scaring thing to have happened to me in a while. She shoves a large tube down my dick hole into my bladder. I immediately feel some relief as I fill up 600 units in the bag. So they ran some tests blood tests and a ct scan and figured out I have a swollen prostrate. They called it prositititis. Which is probably caused by in infection in my prostate. Even before the opiates I had been having issues urinating for a few weeks so it makes sense. Just a painful traumatic way to find out. Anyway they made me an appointment with a specialist shot me up with antibiotics and sent me home with the catheter still in. 

I was in so much pain the hour drive home with my mom. It literally felt like a combo of my dick being kicked and having to pee really bad. I finally made it home and did a tiny shot just to take the pain away. After I get this thing out of me I am never using heroin again. I like peeing way too much and this way to traumatic.

The other day, a motorcycle cop hit the lights and pulled me over. He told me I was going 13 over and asked for my papers. I gave them to him and he decided to go easy on me. Gave me a warning instead of a $200 speeding ticket, a warning for the tag, and a $10 ticket for no proof of insurance. Then, he asked to see my arms. Fuck. He must've seen them when I handed him my license. 

He talked to me for a good 15 minutes about getting clean and back on track. He told me to call 211, and taper if I couldn't handle cold turkey. He didn't hassle me, or change his mind on the tickets. I didn't get searched, or towed, or in any extra trouble. 

My area isn't known for lenient police officers. I was floored. It also kind of says a lot about my situation from a view I haven't had of it before. A stranger could tell. He could see my life is a mess, and he could tell I'm a mess as well. 

Reflecting back, I'm at the lowest point I've ever been in my life. Rent is past due, my bills are piling up. I owe everyone I know money. We never see it until it's too late. 

I'm about 3 years into this daily grind. It's taking its toll. I've been tapering down. I didn't wake up sick this morning, which is a first in a long time, and I've only done 1 d today and I'm looking to only do a half tomorrow. That seems like the impossible part, but how do I maintain? How do I fix everything I've broken? 

My coworkers and manager joke about me 'popping pills', even though they've never heard or seen anything to this affect. My family doesn't trust me and my mom thinks my wife is spending my whole paycheck shopping before I even get it. My in-laws don't say it, but they think we're failures. My landlord knows I'm a flake, if I don't get served with an eviction notice this week I'll know someone is looking out for me, but where do I even start?

Then over the last six months I sell that oxy for dope money and probably do about .5-.6 of dope a day on top of my ms contin.   Decide the other day that I would like to sell all my pills and have it be profit. ..I'm going to attempt to quit.   Like a moron, realizing my d-day is coming, I sell off all of my script.  I have a last hoorah week, probably did a half ounce of black between me and my brother over the last week.    Sunday rolls along, I take my ""last"" shot...sit back and wait, overall excited that I'm going to be ""free"" of this finally.  I'm going to do a sub taper and gradually outsmart the opiate demon and be done. 

I wait 12 hours, all I've heard about subs is that the general rule is...Wait until you feel WD then you won't precipitate WD.   Well, that didn't work for me, I was feeling shitty as fuck, decided that if that was teh rule of thumb, then I must be good.   NOPE NOPE NOPE.  Take 4mg of the subs (was told to start here, even with my habit) and all of the sudden the bad uncomfortable goes to insane ""I want this to stop at any cost, get me out of my body right now"" discomfort.  I wouldn't call it pain, I would call it extreme discomfort, which in my opinion is worse than pain.   I was able to stand it for about 6 hours, at which time I decided it wasw time to stop feeling shitty...but how.   It's about 6am, for whatever reason, my dealer is up, I hit him up instantly and tell him I need to pick up asap.  He says ok...JESUS THANK YOU.   I pick up 700 dollars (the profits from selling my pills mostly) and head out.   He's about 30 minutes away.  meanwhile Im sweating nuts, dry heaving, trying not to shit my pants.   I get to a spot around where we normally meet.  Wait...wait...wait...wait...wait.  

Dude tells me to fuck off til later....Really? You told me to come out, you don't want to make 700 fucking dollars?  

Go home, shit my pants on the way....distraught. 

Get home, not sure what to do, just know I want this feeling to end.   Desperate, check floor of car, house, where I shoot my dope, every pill bottle of any kind.   Junkie jesus provides me with 8 mscontin that have slipped through the cracks.  Start breaking them up and cooking them down immediately, praying that it'll be enough.  Bang first two, eat the slimy gunk left in the spoon.   Cook 2 more, bang them, eat the slimy gunk in the spoon.   Cook 2 more, give them to Brother, eat the slimy gunk in the spoon. ...Few minutes later...sweet relief.     Able to close my eyes and take a nap, dope dealer finally gets back to me, he's going out of town for a week, so make a big pickup.    Realize late last night that I won't be able to make it last, and I won't have enough money to keep myself well until refills in 2 weeks.   Angry at self, depressed at my failure, worried what I'm going to do about this problem...can ration dope if I do .35 a day for the 7 days that dealer is gone...what then, can buy more, but with what money...the usual struggle... 3 points is enough to maybe keep me well, maybe not...not sure, don't usually weigh my shots.   Decide best COA is to game my doctor again.   Come up with story, play it well, hoping doc will just write me scripts without an appointment...says I need to make an appt,  make appt, figure I'm fucked, he's going to see my jacked up arms, or is already suspicious, etc. 

Welcomes me with open arms, writes my scripts out without any hassle (can't give me normal scripts cause insurance won't cover them, but gives me a month of fent patches, and a month of percocet)  He's a caring, compassionate, trusting individual and I take advantage of that as much as I can cause I'm a dirty scumfuck junkie.  SO now while I'm relieved, I just feel like a complete shit head, I couldn'tbe sick for 5 fucking hours...and now my frame of mind is that ""subs didn't work, and I NEVER want to feel that bad again""...pussy.   but at least I'll sleep tonight.

I was sentenced to complete pre-trial intervention. So, I forked over the $1,000+ to complete the program and get this shit expunged and started working on my pti. Well, my pti officer is a fucking cunt. I literally hate her guts. Obviously, I was going to be drug tested for the program. Once that time rolled around, I hadn't prepared at all, I was at a very bad place in my addiction, and I had just made the decision to go to detox. So I straight up told my judgemental bitch of an officer what was happening. She was surprisingly cool with it, told me to get the help I needed, to call her whenever I got clean. Cool. 

Fast forward like 5 months. Rehab didn't work. I certainly did not call that bitch when I got back and kept doing drugs. She finally tracked me down a month or two ago and we've had meetings every so often to check on how I've been and shit. I told her I was still working on getting clean, not doing a good job of it, blah blah blah. So she told me to just finish my community service and she'd complete me, no drug test mentioned. So I do my damn service, go back, and she tells me I have to go to 10 NA meetings. Fine, finish that shit, go back, and she tells me I have to pass a drug test and she'll release me. By the next day (today). 

So i figured I'd use my clean piss I keep around for my parents drug tests if I was able (crotch it and dump it) but was flipping shit thinking I was screwed, because who takes a drug test for pti and isn't watched while taking it?

(Story inside)","Being the fact that although I chip, I still am a junkie. I do struggle with feelings of guilt over said statement. I have done/still do a lot of things that I'm ashamed of and am not proud of, mainly being the fact that I lie to my mother about what I do with my money, and that she thinks I've been opiate-free for the last year. I sometimes wonder how much of a piece of shit that I really am. Well, today I received a test.

As an example of the type of shitty person that I sometimes think I am, let me tell you a story that will give you guys an example of who I fear I am at times:

My best friend, who has been predominantly clean for the last 6 or so months (I can't remember how long ago it was that he got on 'done), has a junkie girlfriend. Well, she used to work at a Salvation Army thrift store. One day, her store received a call from an old lady, stating that just that day she had recently donated some old clothing, and had come to realize that hidden within one of the pockets of said clothing, she had left some money in there. Well, being the inconsiderate junkie cunt that she is, she proceeded to immediately look through the clothing that the old lady donated, and she indeed proceeded to find that hidden money. All $1400. FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. 

So, this old lady shows back up to the store to look for her money. My friends girlfriend proceeds to help this lady look for the money, all the while having the $1400 hidden in her tits, in her bra. She proceeds to lie to this innocent, undeserving old lady and acts like she can't find the money and has no idea where it went. The old lady leaves disappointed, and the girlfriend keeps the money. She then spends it all over the next couple of weeks on booze, cigarettes, and (of course) dope. I was sickened when I found out how proud she was of her find, sitting there as I heard her brag about how she ""hit the jackpot"", etc. She had no remorse. Who knows how much that $1400 meant to that innocent old women? What if that money was all she had? What if she needed that to feed herself and perhaps her old husband, too (I don't know if she was married, it's just an assumption. Maybe she was a widow)? 

I feared that I was just as much of a piece of shit as this girlfriend. Well today, I received my test to find out the answer to my fear. 

I had driven to the nearest ATM to me so that I could pull out $60 in order to cop some dope. 

This doesn't have anything to do with the story. But with that $60 today, I threw in with said girlfriend as I don't have any connects. It's not even like she's even middling for me or doing me a favor. I just throw in with her when she goes to get her own dope. I don't cost her any extra time, money or gas. If anything, I'm helping her out because it's resulting in her bringing more money to her dealer, who in turn, rewards her for catching plays for him. But, she proceeds to tell me that I should give her some dope out of my bag, simply because I had $60 today compared to the usual $40. Her logic is that because I had a little bit more money than usual, she deserved to have some of my dope because it would be more than I usually do. I tried explaining to her that I wanted to actually catch a nod today and not just the measly buzz that I usually get from a $40 bag because that's all I can usually afford. I haven't had more than $40 worth of dope for months. ""Dude, you'll still get fucked up. Throw me a half point. I only have $20 and I don't wanna be sick tomorrow."" So now it's my fault somehow that she didn't work enough today and chose to sit around all day and drink booze, watch netflix, and smoke cigarettes instead of work for my best friends dad, who lets her live at his house for free, and he also pays her daily $10/hour for bullshit work around the house like cleaning windows and washing the floor. Every day she stretches out her work and lies to him and says that while he was gone at work all day, she did 4 or 5 hours of work, warranting $40-$50. Even though the truth is actually that she did MAYBE an hour worth of bullshit work around the house that she lives in and eats from the fridge for free. She also get's taken out to all the family dinners (which are almost daily, and at the very least, no less than twice a week) and eats for free. But yeah, somehow because she did no work all day and chose to fuck around, it was now MY responsibility to give her some of my dope because she had no money to have enough dope to last her through the day tomorrow until she got paid again by her boyfriends dad for more made up/fake bullshit work around the house. She then proceeds to go cop the dope, and OF COURSE my bag is short. Keep in mind that this dealer always weighs his shit out perfectly, and never shorts it. My bags are only short COINCIDENTALLY on the same days when she doesn't have enough money to get her preferable daily amount of heroin. Instead of being .3, it looked like MAYBE .25, probably closer to .2. But remember how she bitched and whined until I agreed to give her half a point before she went and got it? For some reason, as she was mysteriously super fucking high already even though she hadn't even done any out of her bag yet, she said I didn't have to give her the entire half point. So I ended up scooping probably .02 with two cards back onto the fold and handed it to her. Strange how content she was with that... What I'm getting at is that she obviously pinched my fucking bag simply because of the fact that I for once had more dope than usual and she selfishly didn't want to get sick tomorrow morning and wanted enough dope to get high as fuck tonight and have dope left over for tomorrow morning. Again, this all goes to show how much of a piece of shit she is. Ok, back to the original story.

I go to the ATM to take out my $60. As I pull up, there is already a car in front of me at the ATM. It was a really beat up, '90's model pickup truck. In the truck was a really old man. Old enough to be a WWII vet, but it's not like I could know that for sure. Anyways, he was REALLY old. So old that he was obviously very slow, and kind of, for a lack of better words, retarded as a result of being so old. He takes an exceptionally long time at the ATM, and finally after much confusion, seems to give up and pulls away from the ATM. 

Well, what do you know? Right as I pull up, out pops $40 from the ATM. He forgot to take his money. In that immediate moment, bad thoughts began racing through my head. ""Woahhh, I hit the jackpot. Now I can get an entire half gram with this extra $40!"" But, that evil thought only lasted in my head for a few mere milliseconds. I grabbed the money, and proceeded to shout ""Sir! Sir!"". I drove away from the ATM and followed him until he stopped in the parking lot. I got out of the car and ran up to his truck, saying, ""Sir, this money just came out of the ATM."" He looked really surprised, took the money, all the while saying ""OHH thank you!"". I told him that he was welcome and walked back to my car, and proceeded to take my own money out.

It was simply just a reassuring feeling, knowing that even through all the shit I'm in, although I'm a junkie and would have LOVED to have that extra $40, that, except for the brief initial milliseconds of evil thoughts that I had, my predominate instinctual reaction was to chase the man down and give him his money. What was so weird, is that it felt SO GOOD to do what was right. I felt/ still feel so proud of myself for finally doing the right thing in life, for going out of my way to be kind to somebody. It was such a reassuring feeling, knowing that although I'm a shitty fucking junkie, I still have it in me to inherently be a GOOD PERSON and to help people. Driving off from the ATM and simply thinking about what I had just done left me with such a great feeling. It was honestly the best feeling I have had in a VERY long time. Well, I guess I would say it was the second best. The feeling of being high on dope will always be the best (LOL). In that moment, I had felt better about myself than I have in a long time, and felt so good overall. 

i was and still am so happy, knowing that it still comes instinctively for me to do the right thing. I know that if it was my friends girlfriend, and not me, she would have slyly pocketed the money, keeping it for herself to spend on more dope. It felt so good to know I'm not like her. That I'm not completely one of *them*. It gave me hope that I can some day go on to live a life of honor and kindness to all, and that I don't always have to be nothing more than closeted junkie, constantly lying about what I do with all my funds, or where I go at night coincidentally every time I manage to scrape some money together. It felt good to know I'm not like *her*.

I don't want to come off like I'm here to brag. Instead, I hope that this serves as inspiration for you guys to try to do the right thing more often, to try to show people that just because we're junkies, we all don't have to be such huge pieces of shit.

Thank you, and may you all forever bask in the glow of the almighty shit-abyss.

My fiance doesn't drink and can't smoke, so occasionally she likes to have a bit of what I'm having. This summer it was more than occasional, I'd go out on a limb and say it was just shy of daily. 

For some reason, she is still just getting horribly nauseous from low low doses. Her tolerance doesn't seem to be going up at all, which in one way is good as she isn't having to ramp up her dosage, but her buzz is constantly ruined when she ends up puking an hour after taking as little as 5 mg of oxy or snorting 2.5 mg of the opana. she does enjoy the feeling a lot, but it is getting to the point where she gets the hiccups every time and then just throws up over and over to the point that she just gets exhausted and wants to sleep, but I'm nervous t let her sleep right away out of fear she may puke while sleeping and choke. 

What is going on here? Are some people just not meant for this? What would happen if she actually needs pain medication, I'm worried she won't be able to take any without getting very ill. Are there any remedies for this like things she can take or eat before/after dosing to reduce the negative side effect without losing the good feelings? I've never really had these issues and since I'm after pain relief more so than the buzz (that isn't to say I don't enjoy the buzz but it is ranked 2 in my priorities) so I'm not sure how it impacts strictly recreational use.

Sorry for the wall.

tldr: fiance pukes even with minimal opiate dosage despite using enough times that you'd expect her to have developed at least some tolerance",1407992498.0

I am 42 and I have a brother that is 14 months older than me. I quit school and had a baby and started a family at the ripe ol age of 17. My brother finished high school and got married and started a family of his own. He later went on to attend and finish medical school. After Medical School his wife left him and I found out my brother was doing all sorts of drugs. He was smoking weed, drinking alcohol, heroin, coke, speed, acid, and dabbled with meth.

He has never held a job. He always has a reason for either not taking the job or a reason for the company laying him off (unforeseen circumstances). He has lost everything. He steals money from everyone he can by stating life just dealt him a crappy hand. He steals my dads guns. He has stolen three of them to be exact. My father has taken the rest of his guns away from the house. He steals food. He steals my medication, which I have stopped taking because of this fact. He has borrowed $10,000 from my mothers cousin. She can ""afford"" the loss. My mothers cousin doesn't ask for it back because my mother keeps making excuses as to why he can't pay it back. The first reason was.... a brain tumor. Miraculously the tumor has gone away on its own. Miracle #1. My brother then borrowed $5000 from a lifelong family friend. He said he couldn't pay it back because his disks have fused together and he couldn't walk to be able to hold down a job. I caught him peeking around the corner of the house, then running across the yard. I called him out. His bones fixed themselves. Miracle #2. He now has wrecked my mothers car twice and totaled it once. He claims it is because he has leukemia. Soon to be miracle #3.

I have followed him on different ""chemo"" trips and he went straight to his dealers. Now, here is the exciting part.....

When I have tried to tell my mother whats going on.... She doesn't believe me. She accuses me of trying to ruin his career. What career? He has never worked as a Dr. except with his Dr. friend who has lost his license because he was helping the pill shopping community. My brother is one of them. My mother keeps saying if she loses another child (my oldest brother died from a opiate overdose) she will kill herself and she will do everything in her power to keep my brother alive. I tried to explain to her that if she keeps enabling him SHE will be the one helping him kill himself. 

My mother tells me that I have not amounted to anything in my life. I can say that is partly true. I'm not rich. I don't have a fancy high paying job. I've always (till recently) been a stay at home mother and an (ex)wife. I can say, I have never stolen from anyone to support a habit and I have never been addicted to any kind of drug. I try to help my brother by talking to him and I try to tell my mother what is going on. She doesn't believe me, my father knows the truth but he is almost 80 and is tired of the conflict. He just wants to die quietly. 

How can I save my brother? How do I get my mother to listen?",1407961701.0

I'm on Oxy-IR for pain relating to a car accident and at one point was taking 200mg a day simply to cope with the pain. This was on top of my 16mg Exalgo. This was my prescribed dose. After my doctor and I talked about pain cycles and how I am chasing withdrawal as much as I am trying to limit my pain we decided to take me off Oxy-IR. He wanted to use Suboxone or some beta blockers and I refused and went cold turkey. No point in wasting time. Since then I'm simply on my Exalgo and coping with pain and take 5mg Oxy-IR as needed for breakthrough pain being careful not to start the cycle again.

With that being said, my brother died earlier this year due to an accidental oxycodone overdose. 

He had burned bridges with basically everyone else in his life, and I was the last person he could turn to for help. He knew that his relationship with me (only living blood relative in his life) was the last important thing to him, and he'd be damned if he fucked that up. I did my best to be there for him and help him -- he was a good person at heart. A few weeks before he died, he came to me in what I interpreted as desperation. I bought him one last fix with the promise that he would go directly after to a free detox place we found online. He kept his promise and with a lot of difficulty, started a bout of sobriety. I saw him nearly every day at this point and helped him ease through withdrawals with kratom (seriously a huge help). After 18 days of sobriety, he seemed like he was finally ready to change, and we were going to meet up two days later to look at possible free 90 day in-house treatment centers (he had been in rehab before with little success, but never that long). On the day that we were supposed to meet, I got a call that he was dead.

As I eventually found out, it was the combination of xanax and oxycontin that did it, compounded by the 18 days of sobriety. I'm absolutely positive that he had done much higher dosages in the past and been fine. Please please please always remember the importance of tolerance keeping you alive. 18 days was all it took for a ""normal dose"" to be fatal. 

My older brother was my only sibling, and I know that he would be absolutely devastated to know how his choices have affected me. I gave him my love and support til the end, and have in my own way come to forgive him for leaving me. Please let his life be a reminder to remember the importance of drug tolerance and how easy it is to cross that line you've probably been pushing.

Before i used opiates i used to love getting smashed and partying but now i try and drink with my friends and get almost no enjoyment out of it. Just last night i drank like ten beers and barely even felt drunk, i had some physical effects but mentally i felt like i was pretty much all there while my friends were all out of there mind drunk off the same amount of drinks. Ive barely drank in like a year either so tolerance is not an issue. Dont really know why this is happening but it sucks i just want to be able to have some drinks and enojy myself but it feels like drinking just isnt ""good"" enough anymore if that makes sense. Just wondering if anyone had any similar experiences with drinking after getting clean.",1408045543.0

2dkcfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2dkcfr/long_ass_random_story/,9,https://redd.it/2dkcfr,IVn00b,"Long ass, random story","So me and my girl were kicking for real this time (Lol) ""Damn this fucking sucks"" I thought to myself as I stood at work contemplating whether or not I should cut my legs off cause they hurt so fucking bad. ""Just X more hours"" I told myself over and over, til I get to atleast be sick in my own bed. ""Thank god she's getting her klonopin refill today."" This eased my mind hoping itd help somewhat with my WDs and maybe even get some sleep.

I had 15 bucks left in my bank account. ""Its not even worth it man, what will I get 3 bags? Fuck that I need gas to get to work for the week and id just be prolonging the inevitable. "" Then all of a sudden a notification appears on my tablet.  Its from the app Activehours "" Your timecard has been accepted and your hours have been posted to your account"" 

If you've never heard of Activehours its an app that you connect to your bank account. You submit a picture of your (electronic) timecard and once approved you can be paid the next day, up to 100 bucks in one day and 150 in one pay period, and the app takes out what ever you borrow on your payday.

""Holy shit I can get 100 bucks tomorrow."" Instantly an angel and devil appeared on my shoulder. Do it, don't do it, do it, don't do it. The thoughts raced in my head. Then the app informed me it was too late to get your funds tomorrow and they don't opperate on weekends so your funds will be deposited on monday. ""Fuck, its thursday. I guess it wasn't meant to be.""

Finally work's over. It feels good but not as good as I imagined. At least im getting kpins. I get home to find my girlfriend benzed as shit. I pop 4mgs as soon as I get my hands on them. Then things get a little hazy....to say the least. 

""Fuck it im taking out the 15 bucks. Im getting 100 bucks on monday and hopefully my pops can spot me some gas money for the weekend."" My klonopin riddled brain rationalizes this decision. ""Lets hit up Slime maybe he can hook us up"" But fuck both mine and my girls phone are broken at the moment. ""FUCK! We have no numbers"" Then in my inebriated state I remember my macbook should have all my old contacts on it from my old iPhone. But Its been a while since I switchecfrom my iPhone all my contacts are outdated.  ""Fucked again"" I mutter. ""Wait!"" My girl exclaimed ""All of my contacts should be on Verizon.com. 

I couldn't type it in the address bar fast enough. ""View my contacts"" I click. ""S"" I click."" Sam, Sarah, Sean, Sharon, SLIME!"" There is a god I believe momentarily.  Shit the house phone is fucked too... ""Free online phone calls"" I put into google. I find an app that has texting and calling with 10 free minutes,  lets make em count.

Ring, Ring , Ring ""Hello"" He answered thank god. My girl explains to him both our phones are broke and we're calling from my comp. ""We'll be where ever you wanna meet in 15 minutes but we can't call you once we're there"" ""Aight no problem"" and off we go, laptop in hand.

I take the 15 bucks from the atm which is conviently located next to a grocery store with a very lax return policy. ""We can get cigs too"" my girl says. ""Fuck it lets go in"" I agree.

We walk Into the grocery store grab 2 things from a shelf and walk up to a register. ""Id like to return these please"" ""Do you have a receipt?"" ""No, im so used to just throwing them out as soon as I get them is that a problem?"" No but for both things its over the limit so youll get a gift card"" ""Umm okay then ill return one thing and she'll return the other"" I explain without a care in the world. ""Sure"" the cashier says. I have no idea what he thought of us nor could I even try to remeber. 

We walk out cash in hand (totally forget how much) and get a pack of smokes. We shoot up to the city and get to the spot.  A tad problem arises.  In our drunken like state we took waaaaay longer than 15 minutes.Now we need to find some sort of wifi so I can call our guy back. My girl drives around the city finally finding an unsecure router and parking. 

Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring. Fuck hes not answering. I call several more times wasting all 10 of my free minutes. ""We need a phone"" I say to my girl. ""This guy right here has one"" She replies. ""Ask to use it!"" I exclaim.

My girl hops out of the car and walks up to the stranger without a care in the world of course. (We are white as fuck in the middle of the ""hood"") ""Excuse me man can I borrow your phone I need to call my drug dealer"" she says like its a totally normal thing to say to a stanger. ""Sure"" the stranger obliged, not giving a fuck as im sure he uses his phone for the same purpose. She calls but no answer. ""What ya'll trying to get?"" He asks. ""Oh just some weed"" my girl replies ""Fuck that"" I say aloud. ""We're looking for D, you know where the boy's at?""......... ""Hell yeah"" the stranger says ""let me in"". I slide my seat forward and let him in the back. 

""Holy fuck is this really happening? Did we really just find a connect on the street?"" Sure enough he brings us to me ""Lotto"" He hops in the whip. ""What chall wanted?"" I ask to see a bag first. Mmm decent, I think to myself. A full I say. Whyd I say a full? We have only have 15 bucks. Wait, he'll get out of the car and by the time he notices its 15 bucks we'll be long gone. Nope. Hes still in the car. ""This is only 15 bucks"" he says. ""Oh fuck we left the rest of our money at home babe"" my girl explains. ""Can we get 3?"" She asks. ""2"" he says and hands us another bag. ""This is one"" I say. ""Yeah I already gave ya'll one to look at."" ""Yeah but I gave that back!"" ( no I didnt its in my pocket. Gotta love kpins.) We go back and forth and he eventually gives us another bag. We thank him get his number and part ways.

My girl and I laugh all the way home. ""Did that really all just happen? We are retarded.What a random fucking night"" were all going through our heads. But we get home safe and sound and happy cause we got what we craved like no other. 

The next day I smoked wet for the first time with lotto as I picked up from him again (where the fuck did we get money from? I dont remember) but thats a story for another time (if I can remember it....)

TL;DR Me and my girl were kicking, got benzed, wound up cold copping.

Tried snorting heroin for my first time a few weeks ago, and did it once a week for the past three weeks, and each time I did, I felt like none of the problems in my life mattered, and just felt normal. What I can't figure out is, the day after snorting, if I feel worse than I normally would had I of not used. I'm thinking I might, but I'm not sure. Does anybody feel even more depressed after using heroin? I don't mean after going through withdrawal or addiction, but just after one-time use. For example, stimulants definitely lead to a crash and depression after use. Benzo use occasional gives me rebound anxiety. ",1408041929.0

I was nearing the end of my pill stash but had ordered more which I knew would arrive before I ran out. (I'm careful about timing this stuff.)

Coincidentally, the pill delivery was late by a whole week, and for the first time since probably 2012, I went 6 days without anything except 1/2 a 50mg tramadol here and there and one 10mg Valium for two nights when I couldn't sleep from RLS. This is a big fucking deal for me.  I'm normally a 90-150mg daily oxy eater.

Because of the stomach bug though, I really couldn't tell what was WDs and what was just the flu. I'd never gone through WDs before, because I'm pretty good about buying more pills before I ran out.

So... here's the clincher: My shipment finally came yesterday, and *I swear to god* that I was like, ""Meh,"" when I saw the package come. Normally it would be total binge-time, but I just kinda gave no fucks. Instead I let the package sit there, I recorded some new songs and cooked some chicken on the grill and just sorta forgot about it.

How is this even possible?!  

Out of some sense of obligation (??) I ate 60mg last night while watching a movie and again, I was like, ""Meh."" No interest in bumping to feel more... I just kinda didn't care. (I only took 60 figuring my tolly would be lower, and I definitely felt it... but I just didn't get all that excited about it.)

Right now I have the entire day free with nothing to do, I've got a pile of roxies right next to me here on the nightstand, and I just would rather go eat a chicken taco and see Guardians of the Galaxy. 

I'm so excited about this! I'm also baffled... in a good way.

Anyway, what I guess I'm saying is, I think I might be done here, kinda without trying.  The stomach flu was the best gift evarrr.  I had forgotten what it was like to feel like my old happy, normal, creative, non-foggy self.

(Alas, I'm taking a flight in a few days... I fly at least 6 times per month. I can't think of the last time I flew somewhere sober. Will I take something and fall back into a habit, or won't I? Only time will tell. Hope not.)",1408039641.0

Miss my opanas and oxys but had to grow the fuck up as I almost lost everything one yr ago. I leveled at a low 70mg daily dose. Not too bad and still dip into some opanas once every 5-6 weeks or so but thats over bc I just failed my first drug test and am at risk of losing take homes. Fuck that! 

 Anyways my questions are 1. Do any of you have trouble breathing while you sleep? I have developed sleep apnea basically and have very fucked up dreams that I cant breathe or choking then wake up and my chest feels heavy and I'm short on breath. 2. You guys gained weight and/or crave sugar like a motherfucker?  Its like I fucking replaced lunchtime pills with lunch time cake. Wtf? 3. Sex drive is shot to fuck. Id get horny when high on my opanas/oxys or after initial withdrawals but now im just never horny and my fiance is pissed and wants me to quit all opiates.  I bought some vitamins and minerals for libido but theyre BS. Anyone who can relate and or have suggestions please hit me up!",1408034466.0

Who wouldn't want more of that? Fuck, we all deserve to feel that way. But she did it just that time and never touched the stuff again. I have never done anything harder than a couple lines of coke when I was 21 (and hey..that was fun...damn it I would do it again but I just don't travel in those circles where someone just plops down lines of coke- plus I'm old now). I don't have any temptation to do heroin, but I have always wanted to try out ecstasy. But I am such a chicken shit about it.
