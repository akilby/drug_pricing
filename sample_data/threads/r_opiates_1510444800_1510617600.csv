Like, lucky my brothers care about me or else I wouldn't have cigs. So broke that I traded food from my job for bag of weed to help me get through because not only am I too broke for all of the above, but too broke to buy dope is definitely the biggest blessing *and* curse of the whole ordeal. My daughter had an incredibly bad but incredibly quick moving stomach nug two nights ago. Got her thru it, didn't think anything else of it. Until about 2 hours after I got home from work. For the last. 6 or 7 hours now, I have been throwing up violently, and being as I haven't had much of an appetite this week, its just straight stomach acid: yellow, small amounts, painful to throw up. And I'm literally pissing out of my ass, and I can NOT keep water down to save my life. All I want to do is just drink my big ass cup of ice water and sleep. So after about 3-4 hours of this hell, I started wondering if maybe this was tied to my WD. So u hit up a friend who doesn't really fuck with the black except for to get it for me. Homie is the best middle ever so far, and he brought me .6 on front to last me til I got cash. Stand up dude. After he dropped it off, I immediately cooked a decent enough shot, but the vein immediately, and as soon as the rush took over (took the shot while shitting water on the toilet and throwing up all my water into the waste basket) I felt better. Cleaned up a little of my sick mess, actually was able to smoke a cig without making me throw up again, I was even able to drink some water. Decided I wanted one more shot before bed to help me sleep. Melt down the dope, draw it up into the rig, hi to insert the needle into my vein, and the FUCKING NEEDLE SNAPPED OFF THE GODDAMN SYRINGE!!!! Luckily it didn't snap off inside me but, the only rig I had left broke while fully loaded with a dark brown shot. I thought about smoking some but I have never been able to smoke up without coughing real bad, and right now that will 100% lead to vomiting. \n\ntl;dr - been horrendously sick, not sure with what, dope seems to help calm me down (got two hours of sleep after I banged that one shot) and I broke my last rig, leaving me with something that will make me feel better that I can't use.

I get addicted, quit my addiction after a short while, stay clean for 6mo-1.5yrs, then pick it up again and repeat. I pick it up intentionally and I actually kind of view it as cleansing, like a little vacation. A reset button on life.\n\nEDIT: I AM NOT ADVISING THIS. Know yourself, know your weaknesses, and be smart about them.\n\nI've been doing this for about 9 years now. During that time I've graduated from college, went to grad school, had stable and fulfilling relationships, bought a home, and have formed a successful career. I have a savings, stocks, and a 401k. I've never been in legal trouble with drugs despite periods of heavy use.\n\nDoing drugs in this manner has taught me *a lot* about myself and addiction. I sometimes make it sound easy but it *is not* easy. My success thus far, however, puts me in a unique position to hopefully be able to give some useful advice.\n\nSuccessful quitting depends on a few key things in my opinion:\n\n**Obtainable Goals:**\n\nYou need to set obtainable goals. If you've been a heavy user for 10 years straight you can't expect to drop the needle tomorrow. You'll likely fail, you'll get discouraged, and that might prevent you from trying again later.\n\nInstead, set incremental, obtainable goals: Baby steps. At first, these shouldn't even be related to drug use (I'm actually against tapering). An example might be: 'Today I'm going to paint a painting. Tomorrow, I'll wash the floor.'  Get used to setting small goals for yourself and living up to those goals. This brings me to my next section:\n\n**Train Willpower:**\n\n* Your ability to quit depends on your willpower\n* Willpower is a muscle\n* Your addiction has weakened this muscle\n* In order to quit, you must strengthen your willpower\n* To strengthen your willpower: *do things you hate*\n\nThe best way to do this is to *set small goals* (meta) to do things you hate but are not bad for you. An example might be taking an ice cold shower, cleaning your apartment, or (if you can) exercise. If you hate carrots, go eat carrots. If you hate art museums, go to the art museum. Get used to forcing yourself to do unpleasant things. It builds willpower, and willpower will be needed to successfully quit.\n\nSidenote: Seems obvious, but if you start liking something it no longer counts as something you hate. \n\n**Test the waters:**\n\nAs you develop willpower, start testing the waters with your addiction. Most users have tried and failed to quit. Instead, quit for longer and longer periods of time. If you're a heavy user, start with a day. Moderate user, maybe suffer through a withdrawal cycle. If less heavy, quit for a week or two. Do this a handful of times and *accept that these are test runs and not your final sendoff*. This serves several purposes:\n\n* Familiarizes you with the feelings you'll experience\n* Avoids discouragement\n* *Builds willpower*\n* Lowers tolerance\n\nDon't make the decision to fully quit haphazardly. Train for it and prepare for it. You should have tested the waters several times, and have a good idea of what you'll experience.\n\nSidenote: Be *VERY CAREFUL* not to OD if resuming usage. Start small!!\n\n**Perform a ritual:**\n\nWhen you finally are ready, perform a ritual as a sendoff. No, you don't have to dance around any fires naked (unless you want to). However, you should do something tying you to this moment. Consider burying (literally) some part of your life or lighting a sky lantern.\n\n**Quit:**\n\nPersonally I've always found cold turkey to be most effective.\n\n**Recognize that withdrawal is the easy part:**\n\nAcute withdrawal is, in my opinion, one of the easier parts. Not only are you face-to-face with one of the worst aspects of the drug, but you haven't used up all of your willpower yet. \n\nThe hardest days are the ones that follow. The hollow, empty ones where you have no friends, no-one to talk to, and you're pretty sure your family hates you. It is important to continue training willpower--these days are why we train.\n\n**Replacement:**\n\nReplace your addiction with something less harmful. Running and yoga are popular among ex-addicts, and for a reason. If you're worried about replacing one addiction for another: don't be. Baby steps. Worry about that in a year.\n\nHope this helps!""",1510550810

I have never run out before, and I have been having the most excruciating fibromyalgia flare up the past 5 days. I only get oxycodone 10mg 4 times a day, so not a big script and it just hasn\'t been helping enough during this flare up. \n\nI went to the urgent care yesterday, and the doctor told me she couldn\'t do anything for me and to go to the hospital because they\'d most likely be able to help me with pain. She was a nice enough woman, and also recommended I tell my doctor to order tests for rheumatoid arthritis. Well, I can\'t afford to go to the hospital, and am already stuck with an urgent care bill. My deductible is very high and I have not yet found a different insurance provider during open enrollment. \n\nI have 1 pill left and I see my doctor tomorrow. Should I just tell him that I\'m out (one week early) or just go through the WD and wait?\n\nEdit: Update: So I go to my appointment, tell him about everything that went on this month and how I\'m having a horrible flare up and my current meds just aren\'t helping. I didn\'t tell him I ran out, but every time I brought up medication he kept telling me to take this Tizanidine shit that makes me very nauseous, and even gave me refills on it. I\'ve tried it and it helps but it really doesn\'t do shit when I\'m in this much pain. Relax my muscles all you want, other parts of my body hurt too and all it\'s doing is making me sick more than anything. He didn\'t talk about the oxycodone once, and I really don\'t think he would give it to me at all if I hadn\'t been getting it for a few years now.\n\nI\'m extremeley disappointed because it seems like he brushed off everything I said. I wanted trigger point injections too, but it seemed like he just kind of rushed through everything. He also didn\'t order any bloodwork or tests for rheumatoid arthritis like that doctor at the urgent care suggested. He just doesn\'t seem like he cares about pain management.\n \nI fucking hate this. This shit is what I dealt with for years and it\'s so fucking rare to find a pain management doctor that actually gives a shit if you\'re hurting. On my way out, I passed by an office with the door open where the doctor I just saw, the owner of the practice, and two CNAs were listening to a phone call ON SPEAKER with a patient explaining how badly she is in pain. I heard somebody say, ""Yes *name* you\'re just going through withdrawals. That\'s part of it,"" in a very dismissive tone. It made me both disgusted and thankful I didn\'t mention that I was out of meds because I\'m pretty certain I would have been dropped from the program immediately. I fucking HATE the owner of the practice; he\'s a manipulative, sexist, judgmental asshole that tried to make me take a bunch of sample medication that could have killed me, all because he didn\'t look at my chart and see that these medicines are very dangerous when combined with some of the other stuff I was already on. He had such a condescending look on his face when listening to this poor woman on the phone, and how unprofessional is that to blast her when there are patients that can easily hear?\n\nI really appreciate everyone\'s advice, and I wish I had a doctor that just put in the effort. I don\'t see him being there for long, simply because he\'s new and I\'m sure he\'s just there to get experience until he finds a job in healthcare that he actually wants to do. Now I\'m fucked for a week, don\'t have any connects around here, and am just going to have to suffer through.'",1510538678

But she refuses to even consider the option so I said well I can lock you up in a psych ward or in my basement or some shit but if you want to have a nice comfy taper with a nice comfy bed and docs watching you then you should probably be okay with going off the soma for 24 hours. Otherwise you don't get to go to a cushy rehab to kick.\n\nI got this bitch scholarships, round the clock care, the promise of a month long taper so she don't feel shit, and she still doesn't want it.

And it\'s been proven that like a tiny tiny subset of blatantly crooked doctors/pill mills provided the huge majority of the illicit or abused pills.

Hopefully the average joe schmo idiot will then finally realize how fucked the DEA is, and public opinion/support for them will plummet. But then again I could see a lot of doctors being apprehensive in doing so, fearing repercussions, and, at least AFAIK, doctors aren\'t usually union employees, and don\'t have such protections for going on strike (as well as strike pay, but a lot of doctors seemingly have a good amount of savings to live on for the duration of the strike), or they\'re apathetic about the whole situation; maybe it doesn\'t even really effect them, and they don\'t care enough about compassion and preventing the govt./others in general from interfering/preventing them from doing their jobs, and wouldn\'t wanna be in on it. \n\nIdk, this just popped into my head, and I thought that this\'d make a good point of discussion on here.

I have in my possesion a pack of lamaline. Each pill consists of 300 mg of paracetamol (AKA acetaminophen), 10 mg of opium and 30 mg of caffeine.\n\nCan I get high of this? I know that if you consume too much paracetamol\xc2\xa0 (AKA acetaminophen), you will damage your liver seriously and it's a very common incident unfortunately, but only if you reach over 4 grams per day (I think). But to do this, I would have to swallow more than 10 pills, which I think would be more than necessary to reach a good high. Maybe the paracetamol is disrupting this though? I don't know.\n\nI've seen that you can perform CWE (cold water extraction), but is this really necessary?\nI'd like to try it though, sounds fun but risky and I lack the tool to measure degrees.\n\nI have never tried opium pills before so I don't know what to expect from this,but I have some experience with tramadol. Tramadol is a super great opiate in my opinion but is hard to get. I really love it but you have to respect it and learn how to handle it, it can be very dangerous.\n\nA long time ago I had a very weird reaction from it. It turned my penis very swollen into a shape of a tennisball (I'm not kidding). But fortunatly there was no pain and nothing bad happened, I just had to wait a day to get my penis back again. I guess I had taken too much.\n\nThanks for reading this and I hope my writing isn't too bad or confusing!

So J, R and myself set out on a trip to the city at around 11 o clock last night. We pick up from the regular dboy at the 7/11. We get beans/buttons here in the Midwest and just like everywhere else it seems to be fent is becoming the standard when it comes to the dope game here.\n\nDboy immediately says \xe2\x80\x9cbe careful with these homie, they fire af and custies say they\xe2\x80\x99re the best in the city right now\xe2\x80\x9d we hear his shit all the time so who knows but of course everyone\xe2\x80\x99s like oh hell yeah some fuego finally, been dealing with shitty product lately. Lol\n\nJ is the DD to get home so he just sniffs half of one to get well and we head home. Me and R both bust one up each sniff those are nodding uncontrollably shortly after. We\xe2\x80\x99re both fine though. We get back to Rs place and J immediately goes to the bathroom. He bangs the shit and neither R nor myself fucks with needles. We\xe2\x80\x99re bumping some tunes just talking and bullshitting and here a thud from the bathroom.. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you can see we\xe2\x80\x99re this going.. we go investigate to find J, pants around his ankles unconscious on the floor. Immediately R starts freaking out assuming worst case scenario that he\xe2\x80\x99s now got a dead body in his apartment and not just that but this is one of our boys from way back. I propped J up and start trying to talk to him and see if he\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to us. I get a wet was cloth and put it over his head/neck trying to do anything to get him to come too. I put my hand over his neck to feeling for a pulse and he\xe2\x80\x99s breathing now! It\xe2\x80\x99s slow and loud almost like snoring but breathing nonetheless. His breaths are slow and intermittent which alarms me but at least I know he\xe2\x80\x99s breathing. It was at this point I had no fucking clue what to do next? I was just lost. Do I just sit here and watch dude for the next couple hours and make sure he\xe2\x80\x99s good, he\xe2\x80\x99s still unconscious but alive and breathing. R decides that J needs to go home now. We have to carry 200lbs of dead weight down a flight of stairs and put him into Rs car. We take him back to his house and explain to his ol lady what happened and she\xe2\x80\x99s immediately pissed but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to lie about anything just in case considering the situation and someone\xe2\x80\x99s life potentially being on the line. I end up staying over at Js just to make sure he\xe2\x80\x99s okay. He woke up this morning with no recollection of the previous evening events other than him driving us back to Rs and banging 2! of the damn beans even after seeing how fucked up we were after snorting just one. I\xe2\x80\x99m still annoyed with J but glad he\xe2\x80\x99s alive. It was a very stressful evening to say the least. \n\nSo I was wondering if you guys could help me out with tips on how to better handle a situation like that if it happens again, and with all the fent bullshit around I assume it won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last time something like that happens. Also, no one had any Narcan and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where I could get some even if I had the extra funds to do so. Thanks for reading guys. Definitely scared the shit out of me and I wanna be able to help someone more efficiently if possible next time something like that happens.'",1510497072

Its pretty long but I'm not going to include a TLDR because I feel the need to emphasise the importance of looking at the bigger picture in life rather than being stuck in the same thought process every day. For me, thinking like this has had a brilliant effect on my recovery.\n\nIn my recovery I have always found it difficult to find something to fill the time I used to use to get high. Since starting my Subutex program I have managed to find something I'm interested in (astronomy) and it has made me think about the bigger picture in life.\n\nI'd just like to give an example of the power big picture thinking:\n\nEvery morning I walk along the same street on my way to work. I go to cross the road and look both ways before crossing the zebra crossing. As I look right I am always semi-blinded by sunlight (if the Sun's out) reflecting off of a window on a house somewhere up the road but this morning I had a sudden thought...\n\nLight is made up of billions of photons, little tiny packets of energy that were created in the core of the Sun when two Hydrogen atoms fused together through EXTREME pressure to form a Helium atom. Those little packets of energy flew out then bounced around the inside of the Sun for tens of millions of years before they finally got flung out at 186000mph; transversing roughly 93 million miles to the Earth in about 8mins 20sec.\n\nThey then hit the atmosphere, got scattred downward towards the ground where they bounced off of that window and into these two fluid-filled sacs in my face that evolved photo-receptors billions\nof years ago.\n\nThe only reason I was in that possition was because chemical-electrical triggers caused my brain and muscles to co-ordinate themselves into forward directional motion, leading to other muscles to move in the direction of that light - also evolved over millions of years. Those billions of photons then entered my eye and were absorbed by the same photo-receptors and turned into processable information by my brain thus - using chemical-mechanical triggers - causing me to feel pain and temporary vision imparement.\n\nMy point is that these amazing processes are totally un-thought of during every day life, the point is to occaisionally think about these things. Bigger picture thinking makes life a whole lot more interesting!""",1510493332

Firstly; I freaked out 2 weeks ago and turned into an emotional wreck after doing some (frankly average) Heroin for the first time, really started wanting to stop using opioids, relapsed after 6 days and snorted up to .5 a night for 5 days till last tuesday. Again, wanted to stop, think I actually started to experience some minor withdrawal (relatively recent habit). Add on my dissociative anxiety/all the lies I had been telling my mum (whom knew something was up), this time **really** started getting anxious, massive dissociation, ended up telling la madre about my use and things have been improving in the few days since.\n\n**Back to today**; finish work, 2 pints in me, 4/5 days since last use, in the city with money and open pharmacies. A 600mg codeine CWE couldnt hurt right?!\n\n\n *Only discovered opioids 4 months ago!*\n\n*Only a couple stints of daily use!*\n\n*Shouldnt put me back to day 1 right?!*\n\n*Surely...*\n\nI spent a good hour loitering around the city, smoking ciggies and pondering whether or not I should do it. **I had it all planned out as usual; pharmacy for codeine, supermarket for coffee filters and Id be in business**.\n\nThen I thought of mum. And the potential worry that would ensue in me. The potential WD. And the simple question; **Would I rather wake up tomorrow having gotten high (filled with worry and regret) or not, either way I'll be sober as a pancake.**\n\nI walked into that pharmacy, bought the benadryl that I needed while literally staring down those cheap asf codeine packs, walked out and now on my way home on the bus.\n\nMy initial feeling was that I would cave.

This was actual H and even sent me the video of him testing it, as I\xef\xb8\x8f called bullshit because he used to sell some fire then started selling this cut up shit that a g wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even get you well but refused to sell anything fent related       So I\xef\xb8\x8f get excited, As my usual plug was out for a few days so I\xef\xb8\x8f was going through someone who had mediocre (or so I\xef\xb8\x8f thought) dope for the last 4 days. I\xef\xb8\x8f even asked some people I\xef\xb8\x8f knew who messed with him and was saying he finally has the true fire back. So I\xef\xb8\x8f go pick some up get a nice gram and go home, load up probably .15 knowing that this was some fire my usually shot is around .2-.25 anyways.   So I\xef\xb8\x8f register and boom, expecting this super super rush absolutely nothing and honestly I\xe2\x80\x99m still feeling kinda sick.  So of course load up another bigger one probably .3.   Still nothing.  I\xef\xb8\x8f think fuck it throw the rest in the spoon and finally I\xef\xb8\x8f at least get well, eat a little bit and I\xef\xb8\x8f decide I\xef\xb8\x8f guess I\xe2\x80\x99m kinda high,  lay around and eventually fall asleep.    \n\n\n Wake up this morning at like 5 am fell asleep at 12.  Sick as a dog.  Like the sickest I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a long time couldn\xe2\x80\x99t compete a sentence with out sneezing.  Barley made it to the bathroom to shit.  Eventually get a hold of my one dude in the morning to see if he has any left over because he usually bought in bulk and made it last him the week.  But he said he quit and that he went to a 2 week rehab center.   I\xef\xb8\x8f hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard from him in a while and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he went.   But he went to the same plug that I\xef\xb8\x8f was going to(that was out for 4 days).  This plug always swore up and down that his was the purest and was raw h, and we all believed him because somehow this stuff was magic, I\xef\xb8\x8f could do a small amount once a day and be high for a long long time, sometimes not even sick for the better part of 48 hours if I\xef\xb8\x8f didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any so I\xef\xb8\x8ft had legs for days.   So we get to talking for a little bit he said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything but he can get me a sub.   But he was telling me thst when he went to the rehab center they took tox screens and what not and that the only thing that came up was fent.    He was telling me that before he went to rehab no other dope would work for him besides the one plug.   No matter how much he would do.   Now I\xef\xb8\x8f was sitting here thinking to myself, fuck I\xe2\x80\x99m addicted to fent and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know It.   Stuff kinda starts to make more sense,  I\xef\xb8\x8f grabbed a gram the other morning before I\xef\xb8\x8f grabbed the raw, and seriously did the whole thing and was still sick, called the dboy up and accused him of selling me fake shit, but he said no one has complained about it but you so he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do shit about it besides make my next bag stronger.  I\xef\xb8\x8f knew he was adding fent to his stuff as he was honest about it.  His stuff usually had a decent rush to it, you would have to do a lot to nod out, and from the way he was adding it in, was actually safe.   He used volumetric measuring and what not, had a machine that would disperse the powder evenly throughout the mix.  He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fucking around.   So I\xef\xb8\x8f grabbed a half from him this morning, he was kinda mad at me for yelling at him and accusing me of him selling me some fake dope, but he handed me the bag and said \xe2\x80\x9cyou gotta chill man, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell a bag like this to nobody but you, but I\xef\xb8\x8f don\xe2\x80\x99t sell fake shit and can\xe2\x80\x99t be having a customer talking bad about my product\xe2\x80\x9d so I\xef\xb8\x8f knew all he did was add some more fent to it.   I\xef\xb8\x8f got Home and did a shot, and finally got myself well.   But too bad this stuff doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any legs, as it\xe2\x80\x99s now midnight, I\xe2\x80\x99m already sick again. \n\nSo now I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting here fucked.   Dopesick.  Know I\xe2\x80\x99m addicted to fent. Pissed about it cuz there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I\xef\xb8\x8f can do. Can\xe2\x80\x99t get high on anyone\xe2\x80\x99s dope but the two plugs I\xef\xb8\x8f use. Not even if I\xef\xb8\x8f put a half in the rig.  I officially don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get high, I\xe2\x80\x99m just so disappointed in myself.   And now I\xef\xb8\x8f know it\xe2\x80\x99s fent, I\xef\xb8\x8f feel even more like a scumbag. Everything seriously happened soooo fast The last 4 months got out of hand, and the last month has been iv use, which got wayyyyyy more out of hand than I\xef\xb8\x8f expected. \n\n Here is a back story of my recent use. I\xef\xb8\x8f relapsed because I\xef\xb8\x8f hurt my shoulder at the gym and bought a few perc 10s thinking that my 4 years off dope would be ok if I\xef\xb8\x8f was Using these really just for pain.  I\xef\xb8\x8f did use them just for the pain but definitely could feel thst opiate relief and that amazing blanket feeling. So it took me about a month after that to finally ask someone, I\xef\xb8\x8f asked if he had any percs and he said nah, not strong enough for me, I\xef\xb8\x8f usually smoke this fent and showed me this pink powder.   I\xef\xb8\x8f instantly decline not know anything about it besides it was killing all my friends. At first I\xef\xb8\x8f was really skeptical but I was  always over at this dudes house because we would goto the gym together when we got out of work.   And I would see him smoke boat after boat and be ok not dead or anything and not too stupid where he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t function. So eventually I\xef\xb8\x8f was like fuck it man, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one hit.    First time smoking anything off of foil and I\xef\xb8\x8f barely got a hit, but holy jesus did I feel amazing. So after that it was off the races, we would lift then go home and get high.   I\xef\xb8\x8f would never bring anything home with me or anything for a few weeks, just toss him some money for a few hits. Then eventually I was bringing Home 20 bags, and it started getting worse and worse, it was crazy because we could get so much of it for cheap.   I\xef\xb8\x8f eventually got to the point where I was getting sick, and stopped instantly and was actually doing good for a month,   But it brought back all the memories of when I\xef\xb8\x8f was shooting dope, and I\xef\xb8\x8f finally got a connection on some real heroin. \n\n\nAfter about a month or so off of the fent powder I knew what I\xef\xb8\x8f wanted,  I\xef\xb8\x8f really just wanted to expierence the iv rush of heroin one more time.  But I\xef\xb8\x8f couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring myself to use a needle again.   So I\xef\xb8\x8f started buying some of this h, and would snort maybe a line a day.   A half gram would last me a week and I\xef\xb8\x8f could stay consistently high. This went on for a couple months with the habit getting slowly but surely worse.   I was soon snorting a g a day, but it was good dope so it had legs and I\xef\xb8\x8f never expierenced a sickness just kinda was down when I ran out.  So I\xef\xb8\x8f figured iv use would cut that at least in half, and I\xef\xb8\x8f was right for like the first week I\xef\xb8\x8f was probably only doing a point or two a day and I was ok.  But that\xe2\x80\x99s when I\xef\xb8\x8f really started to get sick, I\xe2\x80\x99d wake up sick and have to do a shot before I even took a shit. Then it got to a half a week later, and the last week or two at least a gram a day maybe 1.5-2 if it\xe2\x80\x99s from dude with the mediocre dope.  I\xef\xb8\x8f was clean for 4 years before all of this so I\xef\xb8\x8f know what I\xef\xb8\x8f have to do.  I\xef\xb8\x8f just have to cut all ties.   All my friends, when I was in the programs so they were real friends, all seemed to have relapsed too.   So I\xe2\x80\x99m just sitting here thinking fuck I\xef\xb8\x8f have to make a whole new support group and start all over again.     My life is actually going decently right now, getting back to work after a couples months of being off.   Work is great my Job is great.  I\xef\xb8\x8f maintain, I\xef\xb8\x8f can work through withdrawal if I have too.  But I have the next 3 days off and I\xef\xb8\x8f figure I can get over the hump of the w/d and take a small piece of sub for Work And do the Robert taper plan.   \n\n\nI\xef\xb8\x8f kinda just went on a rant there, I\xef\xb8\x8f apologize.  I\xef\xb8\x8f banged some ice to get through some of the w/d tonight,  don\xe2\x80\x99t know why But this works for me, I\xef\xb8\x8f hate the stuff but it makes me feel ok while I\xe2\x80\x99m high and I\xef\xb8\x8f can actually function.    I think I\xef\xb8\x8f just end up keeping myself so busy that I\xef\xb8\x8f dont have time to think about being dope sick \n\nI\xef\xb8\x8f have no problem saying no to any drug when I\xe2\x80\x99m sober.   I\xef\xb8\x8f just usually smoke weed, don\xe2\x80\x99t drink, hate stimulants, kinda just lived the hippy life going from festival to festival.  And in those places everything you could want is around.   You can find it all out in the campgrounds, but I\xef\xb8\x8f never would search for anything or buy it when the dealers came around.   I\xef\xb8\x8f would occasionally take a dose or two and enjoy a day of music, but in my opinion i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything hard, just things I\xef\xb8\x8f believed were enhancing my life.    But the thing is now, when I\xe2\x80\x99m on dope, I\xef\xb8\x8f can\xe2\x80\x99t say no to basically anything.   It\xe2\x80\x99s turned into such almost a needle addiction. I\xef\xb8\x8f Love the act of preparing and shooting up.   I\xef\xb8\x8ff I\xef\xb8\x8f don\xe2\x80\x99t have dope, idc I\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot a small shot of ice or maybe some powder just to take away from the anxiety of wanting to use a needle.

My mom isn't stupid, she has to suspect something, especially since she's the one I hit up for money. She's also what's keeping me from asking for help. She found some rigs awhile back, and told me if she ever found out I was using drugs she wouldn't help me, she would take my kids from me.  My kids are the ONLY thing that has stopped me from just giving up and out to g a bullet in my mouth. Both of them have deadbeat absent fathers. I'm all they have. And that knowledge has kept me going until now, even thru horrible post partum depression. \nBut now...I just feel like I have dug myself such a deep ass hole, and there's no way out in sight...no one to lean on for support even, just constant judgement from my family.

A couple nights ago I got drunk, called my guy and paid double for him to deliver some shitty powder that i knew was killing me. \n\nThe next day I spent throwing up, sick, nauseated and continued to powerful through smoking this poison. About 3:00AM I started to feel my limbs going in and out of being numb, and it was becoming clear that my kidneys were not able to process all the shit i was putting into my body. \n\nBetween panic attacks I finally realized I was killing myself. It took me years to realize that this was actually life and death like they suggested in rehab. It seriously is. Until now I had been putting the side effects in the back of my head and making excuses that I was just ""Getting old"" and thats what happens when you\'re not 19 anymore. Life and death. My heart had been palpitating, I had gone to the ER once because i put me in Afib. I OD\'d once and spent six days in the ICU, and further continued to numb myself because my ego couldn\'t cope with the fact that I wasn\'t in complete control, and that I wasn\'t invincible.\n\nI just threw out all of my paraphernalia. I\'m getting my house in order that I\'ve been neglecting for months, and for the first time I\'m willing to face the challenges of being bored or having to adapt to overcome cravings. I took the week of thanksgiving off from work, and I\'m going to use the subs I have left to get me through the week, then I\'m gonna withdrawal like hell and not dig myself any further into the hole I\'ve been digging for 6 months. \n\nI know people make claims like this all the time and then they go right back out, and I\'m not only hoping that doesnt happen... but I\'m actually willing to take the steps and precautions I need to make sure I never get back to this dark depressing place that is addiction. \n\nWish me luck. \n\nTLDR: I finally accepted that addiction really is Life or Death, and I\'m ready to power through every fear an addict has about the future of quitting.

He has been accused by his blood relation of theft (which i would not put past him...some things we lent him disappeared).\n\nHe refuses to take any responsibility for his drug use, and blames everything around him from stress to the city he stays in.
