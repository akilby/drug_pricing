Overdoses, withdrawals, financial ruin, the gauntlet.

But even after years of addiction, I still do not regret my decisions. My life before opiates was shit, they didn't make it any worse.  If anything, they provide some brief periods of light in what otherwise would be dull, constant darkness.

The way I view it, my decision to use opiates was a decision to choose a life of ups and downs instead of living in a state of never ending depression. They've allowed me to experience periods of unconditional bliss and euphoria which would have otherwise been unobtainable, feelings that most people will never get the chance to experience in their lives.

Even with all of the negative aspects of opiate abuse, it still seems preferable to the alternative. I understand why people want to get clean, and I support that decision fully, but for me, I think this is a horse I'll ride to the end. Worst case scenario, I get product which is too hot and will fade out of consciousness for the last time in a state of pure bliss. Doesn't seem like a that bad of a deal, especially when compared to the alternatives.

I came across an old interview of Kurt Cobain (""one of his last interviews"" it said) ...I used to be pretty obsessed with Nirvana's music and Kurt Cobain in general when my mom gave me her old CDs. 

ANYWAY, watching that interview led me to watching a documentary called ""Montage of Heck"" that I really liked, and made me want to watch more movies. I really liked this one; there was some dark art incorporated into what I thought was really great editing and mixing of the music. It did talk about his and Courtney Love's addiction somewhat, mostly focusing on Courtney Love's pregnancy and the birth of their daughter. 

Have you guys seen 'Montage of Heck'? Is there any other related films or books you recommend or could give a review on? I know the movies are not recently released or anything, but I still find his story and Nirvana's success story interesting. I've read books on Kurt Cobain (like his journals) and love Nirvana's music.

I've described dope scene in Chile in other post, won't go to it again. I'll just remember you that we have methadone...not the one for replacement therapy, but the one for ACUTE HELL IM DYING PAIN. IM/IV screaming in the side of the vial (pharma grade btw).

An old dboy gets in contact with me. Usual price for methadone, $USD 10 for 1 vial with 10 mg. This guy offers me 30 vials in 50 dollars. I couldn't refuse. Due to high affinity but partial agonism, is very hard fore now to get on morphine, so methadone is the way. Even with methadone, if I want to nod (which Is what a really love, and the whole point of this rant) I have to pop some of them to achieve it.

My probation ends august 4th and I plan on celebrating by getting high 38 days after my shot( the 4th ) if i even get high. I know my tolerance will be next to nothing Im not going to go ham and im getting my 2nd shot on the 9th. I plan to stay on the shot for a decent amount of time like 6 months to a year. Probably a year if im getting high in between shots. But I really dont even plan on doing that too much. I will never go back to being a daily user and being physically dependent. Also I would recommend the shot to anyone who can deal with cravings. Once your injected get over it cause your not getting high at all, ive tried it when they started me on naltrexone pills prior to the shot and its not happening so man up and get your shit together.

But it's nice anyway to be eating chick fil a for breakfast and watching ""star talk with Neil de grasse Tyson"" lmao

Anyway, this was in the late 2000s/early 2010s (I know exactly when it was but tryna stay vague)

So my friends and I were seniors at a huge southern state school - I needed only one class to graduate BUT I didn't wanna pay for it so I took a full time schedule to keep my scholarship lmao. We'd just won the NCAA football national championship in an iconic game that we flew out to, and I was in 3 super rando 400-level electives in my major, not even sure I cared what they were when registering, I just clicked the first 3 open haha

One of them was the worst/least interesting fucking experience of my entire life; it was a survey class where we read maybe 10-12 books by the same fucking dude all semester. Terrible writer, no knowledge even up for grabs. It was also at fucking 8am on Tuesday's and Thursday's 

So being the era of time it was ... we were still gripping OG 80s for maybe $50-60 each at that point. I made enough money to have at least a full 80 for each one of those horribly boring classes. I'd signed up for it along with my best friend, who happened to be a rather stunning blonde bombshell female (I'm a relatively attractive male).... she would walk to my place before class and we'd take anywhere from 5 to 22ish gravity bong hits in rapid succession, I'd break down my OG80, and then we would show up to class fuuuuucked up and high as balls; arrived late probably 96% of the time haha

One morning I'd ""had enough."" I couldn't stand the idea of listening to that 80 year old professor drone on and on and on for an hour and 15 minutes but i also couldn't afford to lose my scholarship or my GPA/honors I was graduating with.

So that morning, for the first and only time at school, I broke down the entire fuckin 80mg OxyContin and railed it in one fucking line hahahaha. 

Next thing I know? We'd somehow already walked to class across campus and I had no clue how that happened. 

And then class was over... WHAT? It took us *that* long to walk 3/4 of a mile? No way....

Ofc not! I had been asleep. Thanks to my best friend sitting by me each class, I luckily was able to get a report on what exactly happened. Well, that day I'd apparently sat down and was asleep within a few breaths. Not only did I sleep ... my unconscious head apparently was magnetically drawn to the middle of my friend's cleavage. Not only did she try to wake me up consistently, she also tried countless times to shove my head outta her tits and to the other side! Apparently 100% of attempts were unsuccessful as my head always fell back into her boobs

According to the entire class, I was snoring more loudly than our professor was able to talk haha. And ofc with snoring came along the drooling... all over my friend's boobs. She was furious!!

I ended up graduating with my first C in that class haha. I do believe I was asleep, not nodding/ I was quite accustomed to waking up in the 10-11am range at that time so an 8am class was always sleepy anyway 

So that's the story... I have lived a very professional and public/community-heavy life so tbh I don't have very many crazy stories involving opiates because if the wrong people found out it could be bad news bears. But my friend and I always still get quite the chuckle out of that memory haha

I remember getting OC80s for about $40, then about 1 year later some dealer had a bunch of OP80s, and he was like ""You think people will even want these? Would anyone give me more than like $5/pill?"", obviously I said ""Absoletely not, those things are worthless but I'll give you $5/pill for everything you got"". Opana40s(a yellow triangle with the corners cut off) was the best thing I ever had. Anyway, the reason I mention this, is that sometimes, we would actually score subs. It was a shitty tasting orangish flavored orange/pink film. And it got me high. Not Opana, or OP nice, but still high.

So my question is this. I 100%, no questions asked agree that taking this is better than IVing some random shit you find on the street, but is subox not just another opiate? Why switch from Oxys to Subs? Assuming you're not shooting up. To me it's like a nicotine patch, sure, you ain't smoking, but you're doing the same active drug, and just as often, so how it is better. Is is better to switch to Subs and taper vs just tapering oxy? I understand H is a different ballpark.",1499844227.0

A few years ago I stupidly began purchasing things online to help with self diagnosed depression and ADHD, most of them were harmless, things like L-theanine, Piracetam, Lions Mane, etc...until I came across one called tianeptine, which upon reading about it, thought was very safe as well but boy was I wrong. Its a mu receptor opioid agonist but I didnt know that when I had purchased it, and in fact the information about that had only come out once I was already addicted

Basically youre supposed to take it in very small doses, 12.5 mg but not having a mg scale I started just pinching small amounts and one year later I was ingesting about 7g at the height. The withdrawals were AWFUL, they come on super fast. I would feel my last dose wear off, the warmth leave my body, and 6-7 hours later I would have terrible cold sweats, burning in my muscles, pain, insanely huge pupils, the works. 

I never would have taken it if I knew how it worked, after my addiction i've been thinking about doing more opiates (lol) but all ive ever done is the tianeptine, codeine, hydros, and kratom which I now take every day and has helped me stabilize from my addiction. My Questions are, for anyone who has used this and can speak on it:

1) How bad were the withdrawals for you? How does it compare to H, Oxy, Fent? On r/tianeptine there was a poster the other day who claimed he once shot 2 buns in a day and it barely touched his 5g/day tianeptine withdrawal. That sounds a little crazy to me but there are multiple posters who say that tia is worse than H withdrawals

2) Strength and euphoria wise, how does it compare to other opiates like the ones I mentioned in the first one? One interesting thing that i've seen said about tianeptine (in this sub as well) is that it jacks your tolerance UP, i'd imagine a huge habit with tia could outweigh most pill habits easily, what about dope? Euphoria wise I found some of my initial experiences to be absolutely incredible but in my last relapses it wasnt euphoric at all and that would be after not using for a few months

These might seem like stupid or weird things to ask but I'm very curious now because there was very little info on tianeptine WHILE I was addicted but now its very popular on reddit and we know its a mu receptor agonist. I dont even think I knew what opioids were, I just found myself with an opioid addiction after running out a few times and looking up the symptoms (I was positive it was an opiate when I took loperamide and it relieved my withdrawal symptoms, when I didn't have a big habit). And I always wondered because my cousin is an h addict, going through his addiction the same time as me, and I always assumed tianeptine was a weak opiate and my cousin was having way worse withdrawals than me. Could it have really been the other way around?",1499833613.0

6mr6hb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6mr6hb/oxy_and_food_my_conclusions/,8,https://redd.it/6mr6hb,ChaquitaBanana0bama,Oxy and food. My conclusions.,"In my quest to maximize the fruits of this expensive af indulgence I have scoured the internet for info on what is the best approach to oxy and food. Basically people's responses come in two camps:

1. Taking them on an empty stomach results in the drug passing faster through your system thus more euphoria (not the best for pain management but preferable if someone is trying to get a rush on).

2. Oxy is fat soluble. Eating a fatty meal just before or up to 30 mins after dosing will help absorption. As far as I understand this means you will get more out of the oxy but with a more delayed onset meaning less ""side effects"" positive and negative. 

After some druggy experimentation, all in the noble and *high minded* name of science, I've found for me personally the most effective way is to take them on an empty stomach, wait 20 mins and then eat a fatty snack (a donut, a slice of pizza, a PBJ sandwich). Basically something fatty but which won't bloat my stomach and make the onset too slow.

I feel like this is the best of both worlds as a lot of the pills hit me on an empty stomach and I get quick a euphoric come up and a blissful peak (more than I do if my stomach is full.) But with the snack the buzz also lasts longer and feels stronger then it does when I take them on an empty stomach and then eat nothing. Lately I tried taking them on an empty stomach again and the peak was disappointing in comparison to times when I had a fatty snack after dosing. Now I get OCD enough about it that I set my phone alarm for 20 mins after I dose just to be sure. 

Anyone else find they have a similar ritual? Or find that something completely different works best for them? I find it fascinating how little things like timing and food choices can practically much make or break an opi experience. ",1499827810.0

Might be a shit post but this is how my days gone.

Woke up this morning not knowing whether I'd have enough money to score or not. I Had to wait for a direct deposit that comes through usually around 12 but not sure the exact amount as it depends on tips and with my cell phone bill almost due I knew it'd have to come out of this deposit. I could have easily checked my earnings to know what to expect but on the other hand if the tips sucked I didn't want to know.

Luckily I woke up feeling pretty good despite the fact of falling asleep at 530am be waking up at 9. Having finished the last of my dope the day before around 12 I knew the withdrawals were coming. So rather than sit around and wait for my deposit to clear I had picked up a few hour block of deliveries until 2pm. 

So mind you it's hot and humid out. Living in the desert I can do the heat but the humidity and me don't get along. Something about Hauling cases of water and groceries up to 3rd floor apartments  in this weather just sounds awful. After waiting to pick up my deliveries for a good 45 mins I was really starting to feel the withdrawals kick in. Finally they call me up to get my load and to my surprise it was one cart with just 2 items. 

I had made out like a bandit and only had to drop off one load. What a relief. I Made quick work of it and started making my way home. Stopped off at my bank to check my balance and to my surprise I had an extra 40 after filling my tank and buying a few packs of smokes and buying a few packs of well needed sour patch watermelons. 

Hit up my guy who is usually fairly prompt and he tells me it's gonna be about an hour. Could be worse right I mean I like his prices and he delivers so instead of taking a journey out to meet my other dude who lives 35 ish mins away I decided to wait. Long story short time times moving ever so slowly as I'm full blown sick now. It ended up taking him 3 and a half hours of being led on with those god awful texts of just awhile longer. 

Finally he texts me that he's here. I practically run out to his car get my balloon of some delicious west coast black tar. One problem he's out of rigs. Shit going through my old ones I find one suitable rig that might work. I make quick work of cooking up my shot and tie off. the whole while I'm praying that I can hit a vein with this fucked needle. First try I hit . Wait for it.. wait for it. I usually count to see how long until I feel it hit while at the same time I rush to try and clean out my rig before I feel it. A lil game I play that I rarely lose.. 7 seconds and I melt into a state of pure bliss. My temporary state of heaven.

Something about doing a shot after not having done one is the most satisfying to me. Don't get me wrong if I have the dope I'm not going to wait but the sheer amount of satisfaction I get from a shot after waiting doesn't even compare to any other. What do you all think?

.       This was over a year ago. I've had many relapses since then and have spent half the year high, a quarter withdrawaling,  and a quarter clean and alright. I always look back to that day the Judge offered me Vivitrol free of charge, and wonder if I made the right decision. I am 12 days clean from Heroin and hope I can finally say I know I made the right decision. But how increadibly different my life would be if I would have accepted the Judge's offer. Oh well, I will never know. 

.        And some questions for anyone who has experience with Vivitrol. How did it make you feel? Were there bad side effects? Did it make you more happy being on it? Depressed?  Did you even notice it? Did it help with cravings? Any input is appreciated. ",1499807623.0

Here's I'm getting fucking lost, I register EVERYTIME, literally every time I watch the blood pop back up into the syringe. And yet, despite making damn sure my rig isn't moving at all, I cannot get the damn rush for my life. Like, really I register every single time, I'm not feeling any pain, burning, or other sensation to indicate I'm missing. I press the plunger slowly and carefully, yet deliberately and quickly enough, and I can't get that fucking rush.

Smoking got way to fucking expensive, and there's no way I'm gonna continue wasting my diesel like that. But I'm getting hella frustrated at not being able to get the fucking rush, and I'm missing that glorious taste in my mouth that comes along with it..

I'm using the stupid little 30 gauge diabetic insulin needles. I don't know man.. Maybe this is a shit post but I'm mad frustrated at this point. And I'm waiting good periods in between shots a) to make sure I'm not worked up and doing a shit job hitting myself, and b) so I don't do too much.

TL;DR to recap; Im registering every time with the 30g insulin needles, carefully pushing the plunger as not to move the needle out of the vein, but STILL not getting the rush.

Is it possible I'm getting a false register some how? WTF man, I just want to get one or two solid hits in before I run out of dope and then kick...",1499806978.0

Yesterday was first day no opiods. I feel like CRAP today. Is this because of the opiods?,"My back was injured in a car accident.  It got worse and worse until about 6ish months ago, I couldn't go through a day without oxy and/or hydro.  
Surgery was about a month ago.  While in the hospital, I was on diuladid, oxy, etc.  After hospital, back to oxy and hydro.  On average 10x3 oxy, 10x2 hydro a day before and a few weeks after surgery.  Last week I went down to just an oxy in the morning.  Yesterday was the first full day nothing but advil.  Woke up this morning feeling like CRAP.  My legs were so sore, like I ran a marathon, but only went on a slow 1 mile walk yesterday morning.  I feel like what I imagine a linebacker for an NFL team feels like after a game.    
Is this my body experiencing withdrawls?  So far I have taken 10x3 hydro and I have only been up 8 hours.  And that is really not helping the pain in my legs, and pretty much my whole body.  
Also, since tapering the oxy and hydro, I have been EXTREMELY sleepy.  The other night I fell asleep at 7pm and didn't wake up until 5am.  10 hours of sleep for me is unusual.  If I can get 7 hours I am set.  Since I started tapering the oxy and hydro, I am getting 8+ hours sleep and still feeling exhausted.

**UPDATE: I am still having back pain from the surgery (apparently it did not heal as expected).  About 4 days ago, I stopped taking the oxy completely, and only take hydro as needed (about twice a day).  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  I am no longer falling asleep at my desk at work, I have a much more positive outlook on life, my productivity is back to what is normal for me.  I'm not sure how long I will need to be on the hydro, but I will never take another oxy.  Not because of the possibility of addiction, but the fact oxy makes me into a lazy bum!",1499806732.0

So my question is have any of you had similar experience or what is your experience with the vivitrol, and my second question is tomorrow is day 28 for me and this being my 3rd vivitrol shot, what are the chances i can actually get high? and please don't tell me I'm dumb, waisting money etc. money isn't a big issue for me right now as i have couple hundred disposable income each week from working and being on vivitrol, and i don't need a lecture about overdosing on it cause i do my shots gradually gauging my tolerance starting with a half a bag.

Intimidated or dared,

Key word; *myself* if anything were to happen to him. (he's a heroin addict, unfortunately...) 

But what's not fine is that, even with his own paychecks, (that he's telling me he's not getting it's been three months and they're holding it but obviously is getting paid because he's getting high everyday) he asks me for money for subs or for gas or food or whatever the excuse is that day. It's $20 here, $15 there, $5.. often. It's draining my bank account. I can't pay all the bills, buy all the food, take care of the upkeep and continue to work 40+ hours a week to have my bank account float in the same place Every. Single. Week. I make good money (for my living expenses. I should be extremely comfortable. I, myself am very good at saving money. 

For example in the next two weeks I'll bring home at least $1000, I'm a server, it varies. which SHOULD have me at $1800. However, with him needing money all the time I PROMISE after bills come out and everything, I'll still be at $800 in my bank account. And I'll more than likely dip below that because of him. 

The main problem here is, and what you're probably thinking; ""why can't you just say no to him?"" Well I DO but he says ""fine I'll just go get heroin for free hopefully I don't overdose"" and well, I WATCHED him overdose on our anniversary last year he KNOWS what those words do to me as I struggled A LOT after that happened. I'm just now beginning to be okay. He uses it against me every time I say no, therefore leading me to saying yes. Every. Single. Time. 

Should I cut him off from money for EVERYTHING? He ""should"" be getting another paycheck on Saturday. Apparently his job is ""holding it from him because his W2 form has to go through the accountants"" I would've quit by now if that was true it's been three months and idek what all of his excuses are anymore but my idea is that instead of him giving it to me (as he owes me $1200 for bills ) is that he just ""keeps"" it and ""buys himself everything he keeps asking me for"" I can't afford to keep doing this I'm digging myself into a hole

6n0fk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6n0fk7/an_insider_story_on_pill_mills/,80,https://redd.it/6n0fk7,helicopter_pocket,An insider story on pill mills,"What I'm about to describe here happened over 6 years ago and pretty much everybody involved is now in federal prison after the DEA simultaneously raided over 50 people involved in the operation one sunny California morning.

My grandmother was a doctor in Russia, after moving to the US she was not able to get a medical license for whatever reason, probably due to her age and language barrier. She started working for private medical clinics, and carried on doing so for over 10 years, until she ended up at a shady pain management clinic. 

Unbeknownst to her, this clinic was responsible for 40% of the OC80's, Roxi 30's, Norcos  and so forth that ended up on the streets of LA. She was sort of an assistant to the main doctor, doing medical charts and all that. She eventually figured out what was going on, but the money they offered her was just too much to turn down for an old lady in her position.

What these guys did, every morning they would send out a shuttle to Skid Row with their charismatic driver. He would drive around looking for homeless people with insurance, promised them $80 if they came with him to the clinic. He would usually have the bus filled up and on the way within 15 minutes of arriving at Skid Row. They would take these people to the clinic, make false medical charts describing whatever conditions would require these people to get pain pills prescribed, give them their $80 and send them on their way. Of course the prescriptions that were written for these people were never given to them.

After they had enough of these prescriptions written out, it was time to get the pills from the pharmacy. They were doing business with a guy that owned a chain of pharmacies, I believe about 3-4 of them. Next step was to find people to go and fill those prescriptions. Who better than the drug addicts?! They would fill 3 regular cars with about 4-5 people, give them the prescriptions and drive them to the pharmacy. Of course the pharmacy was involved, so it didn't matter if the name on the ID did not match the prescription. These guys would get a few OC80's out of it and hand the rest to the main guy responsible for obtaining and distributing the pills on the streets. It was definitely a huge payout for everybody involved.

The trials went on for about 4 years, everybody turned against each other and snitched.
All the head honchos are serving 10-15 years on conspiracy to distribute drugs. My 76 year old grandmother is serving 3 years in a federal medical prison, she could have got off with probation if she testified against the others but she refused. The doctor who signed all the prescriptions committed suicide even before the trial began, as he was also facing charges of second-degree murder due to an overdose that was somehow traced back to him.

Well that's about all I know about this case from what I heard at the courts and from my grandmother.

I get this horrible impulsive kleptomania from shooting diesel man. Like, anything and everything. I've nicked a beanie someone left sitting on a table at my local dive bar. The dive bar I frequent like four nights a week and know every fucking head at. I didn't even like the beanie.. I just took it..

And corner store.. fuck corner stores beware when Im getting down. I'll just nick candy, trading cards, drinks... anything. So bad sometimes that I'm stuffing my pockets and my waist band with bullshit I don't need.

A few times I've pulled bigger things. This past week I actually did something stupid as fuck and grabbed an electronic and then turned around and sold it for dope money. And I'm still in the process of getting the funds to pawn it back and cover my damn tracks....

A couple weeks ago the clerk at the store suspected me.. I went up for my dutchies and he made me empty my pockets. I had one bag of sour skittles that I had nicked, but luckily I had some other opened candies and played it off so he begrudgingly let me just go...

But yeah, dude I hate it. I don't just feel guilty, like I don't even like being a scumbag like that. But it's also big fucking trouble and I know that.. but I don't know what to do.

It's a complete destruction of my impulse control. It's definitely the biggest drawback of being stuck on dope for me. I feel like it's worse than my track marks, being broke, being sick. I really fucking hate it man.

TL;DR - I get a bad case of sticky fingers fro shooting dope. It's an utter lack 100% of any impulse control and I hate it. Anyone identify with me? Or at least just tell me what a huge fucking dumbass I am, because I know it but god damn I can't fucking help it.

He told his gf (one of my good friends who lives with him) that he didn't feel well and had to lay down. He made really weird noises, not vomiting or anything, and then just stopped breathing. His gf called 911, then used narcan on him and it did nothing. She lives in a downtown area, EMT's were there almost instantly, he received 2 more doses of narcan and again nothing. He was put in a drug induced coma, and after over a week was finally brought out of it. Now he is ""awake"" (as in eyes open and blinking, while staring at nothing) and is ultimately just extremely brain damaged to the point of no return. In total its been about 11 days now since the ""overdose"". they found xanax in his system as well if that makes a difference. he has no clue whats going on, who he is, who anyone else is, etc. he's basically a ""live"" vegetable. He's on life support now, and the doctors say the only brain recovery he will achieve will happen in the next couple of days and after that, however he is will be the way he stays forever. My question is why didnt 3 hits of narcan work, and is it really true that theres nothing to be done to pull him out of the brain damage he has now?

Days of Darkness

Chapter __

""The Abyss of Pure Bliss""


5 more grams added to my drug inventory, a rock hard lump of tar as black as my soul...but still it beholds the beauty that only some will understand. I take a book and smash the black rock into bite size pieces within the bag. Almost reminds me of being broke as a kid and crushing a packet of top ramen and then adding the flavor packet ad shaking it up..no water, just dry ass top ramen..it was a cheap and easy treat when we didn't have much.

I look inside the bag at the broken chunks of dope, this should be enough to get me through the weekend...I scoop about a grams worth of tar heroin and drop it into the pill bottle, along with the powder from 2 cap's of benadryl and a bit of baking powder, I also seem to prefer Clabber girl. I've lost count of how many of their 250 gram jars I've run through...I could build a small fort with them. Lactose and mannitol are milder tasting and even a lil sweet...but the clabbergirl is the tried and true medium of choice.

 There are already a few dope residue covered quarters and nickels in this old small advil pill bottle.. I screw on the top and shake it like a madman to crush the tar.

""Click clack, click clack, click clack""
Over and over again as the coins crush the heroin into powder...the finer the better. As I remove the cap a cloud of light brown dust rises  and the smell of vinegar awakens my senses.  The sunlight reflect off the small particles floating in the air and I just stare at it....bliss is near.

This clacking sound is the mating call for all tar snorters in my area...soon as you hear it, you know there's someone with dope nearby. As you make your way through the valley of the shadow of death (otherwise known as the Tenderloin) you will likely hear this sound echo through the streets. 

The TL itself is the realest reality show you can ever see...and I still laugh as I see a family of tourists wander down the wrong block trying to find their hotel and end up right in the heart of the dope track.
The rich and poor run parallel to each other and in less than 3 blocks you can go from being near a high end fashion store to being in the dead center of a high traffic dope spot...and we're talking about just the daylight hours. The TL at night is a whole different story.

Enough bullshitting, it's time to get high...I look inside and see a nice soft brown powder mixed in with my coins. I use my thumb to block the coins from falling out as I tip the bottle and tap it so the dope sifts out ...right into the bottle cap itself.. 

 I tap the cap to even out the pile and begin to blast away...bump after bump of this beautiful brown sugar soon enter my system.

 Years ago I remember someone saying that say 50% of US currency contains  traces of dope and I'm not surprised because 90% of my powdet is snorted with whatever dollar bill that I have left...the crispy 100's are always my favorite though....

I begin to snort away the powder in sections from the cap... and then refill it with more brown sugar. The taste of the mixed powders that make up this conconction took some getting used to....it would bur  so bad in the beginning, but now I love the bitter burning sensation as it hits my nose. The darker the mix, the better the true flavor...at times the benadryl or xanax can really make it taste like shit.  Peace for me is having a pocket full of dope and nothing scheduled for the entire day.  

Again the dollar bill reaches my nose and with a quick snort more of this powdered pleasure disappears from the cap. I tilt my head back and close my eyes to enjoy the peaceful sound of my pacified conscience and emotions.  

My eyelids open slowly after a few minutes but feel heavier, my anxiety melted away like an ice cube in Arizona. The gorilla on my back has turned from a demonic beast that demands to be fed into a mellow spider monkey with a dopey grin.

I nod off and my head tilts all the way back as the dope takes full effect. Nodding for me has a few stages, either my head bobbles back and forth endlessly like I suddenly have rubber muscles (the bobble head effect)...or my head just falls back, with my mouth wide open. This is being pez'd out (passed out), because I look like I'm imitating a PEZ candy dispenser...

As I breathe through my nose I taste the dope drip slightly down the back of my throat, and I drift off into my nod and let the world slip away.

So, as alot of people here know, chronic pain leads to well, most of the time, long term opiate use... and i don't like using opiates, i don't, but its the only thing that works (ive tried everything else on the market, in the drug stores, everything, apart from illegal things like weed). I don't like getting high off it, i sometimes need to take larger dosages just to feel less pain.... but i don't like having that ringing in my ears every time i yawn (that rushing noise in your ears, idk what the fuck that is but someone pls stop that noise it hurts). I don't like the hypnic jerks, i don't enjoy ""nodding"" off because im a very active thinker, and doing opiates dulls my thoughts, ruins my punctuation (I write articles for a website that covers video games, and movies, E3 was hell lol). 

Last week, i had a liver scare, got a blood test done, doctor said my liver is 99% okay, compared to 100%, he said its not good good, but it's nothing serious, and he said to reduce my dosages from 8 pills a day to, well, less... and whilst ive been trying, those 8 pills a day (4g APAP, sometimes 5-6, not good, i know, i need to know how the liver works one day, just so i know how long it takes to detox)... Right now im not getting any liver damage symptoms i dont think (no jaundice, no swelling, no liver pain, maybe some stomach/fat roll pain, but thats because im a fat fuck probably... i trust the blood test). 

Im just, stuck in that endless loop i feared i would get stuck in... im in the public health system, and i fucking cant wait until i get my surgery appointment... there isnt a day where im thinking ""how long am i gonna keep poisoning myself"" (sorry if... thats a bad word here, i dont like being dependant on something to relieve pain). 

now... here comes the tough part

4 days ago, i... attempted a certain thing that people shouldnt do... and i rushed to the hospital... you know that moment you... did something and beforehand you think ""yep, its time"" then 3-4 minutes after ingesting something, you're like ""fuck fuck fuck""... i took 15 40mg propranolol's (i have anxiety and heart palpitations) and just, sat there, waiting... 2 hours later, my heart rate dipped to 33, and i had a very low blood pressure, i felt dizzy, breathing was... well, barely there (i think thats called respitary depression?)... got rushed to the hospital via ambulance, and the rest was a blur, something about pumping the pills out of me, or forcing me to vomit or something, then i was on suicide watch for 2 days before being an outpatient...

Never again, that's for sure...

3 years, 3 years of back pain... http://prntscr.com/fuuzn9

That's my MRI from 2014, im only 23, this is the loophole, this has been my story for the past 3 years... well, the pain/drug part of my life, not the... other parts.

Sadly a week after I was back on blues, 45mg actually was my limit for the night I was out lol. Any ways I'm back at stage 1 I've got so much kratom but honestly it doesn't hit the spot with the restless legs, that's the worst for me with WDs I can take the shits and chills. Yesterday I actually just decided to get some subs I always told myself I don't want to get into the subs cause I heard the WDs were worst. I only did like a quarter of the sub and actually got a good buzz and was feeling good, I have a low tolly lol. I'm tired of living like this honestly going broke every Friday when I get paid just to get blues.. Been wanting to upgrade to a gaming Pc for the longest which is about 1500$ but blues have been stopping me. Hopefully I can kick this habit I'm positive about this.

6n8pr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6n8pr5/why_function_on_heroin/,11,https://redd.it/6n8pr5,Shabizzle420,Why function on Heroin?,"(Side note before you begin to read, these are all my own opinions and are all open to interpretation by the reader.)

TL;DR: My view on what Heroin does and why it shouldn't be used every day, even if accessable, it's seriously bad for the mind, body, and soul. Nothing in this world, should block the one thing that keeps us separate from animal, and that is our mind. 

So, a little of my background before we get onto this subject. I've been a user for 8 years. Been on BTH (smoking) for 7. Started with Oxy and worked my way up to Heroin during the summer of my 19th year of living. I've maintained a job, have my own car, have all the emenities I need. I've kept it a secret nearly my whole life now, and plan to keep it that way. This is the darkest secret I have, and it shall be that way until the right time. 

So, I'm now going on 2 1/2 weeks sober I believe, and that is 2 1/2 weeks of non-stop thinking. So, opiates puts that blanket over your mind, so whatever you are going through, gets tucked away in a shiny brown metal box, in the corner of your mind. Whether your mother just died, or your dog got run over, or you just got that fat promotion you were working so hard for, or, you just got some pussy by a woman you've been getting at for months now. ALL those emotions are tucked away while you use. You feel NOTHING. 0 feels. None. Feelings? What the fuck are those? Happiness? Nahh, that shits wack. Sad? Nah, I don't feel that shit, my heart is black. Depression? That shits for pussies. Love? My love is for Heroin. 

I feel that as humans, we need and thrive on emotions. If you go through life, emotionless, there's is nothing that is pushing you to better yourself everyday. If you aren't doing just that, you aren't existing as your true human self. 

So, I see on this sub, all the time, the age old question ""Would you be able to function on heroin if easily accessible?"". Yeah, of course we would. The points that are always made, is the fact of it's not the drugs that make us the way we are, it's the LACK of drugs. Which is true, as soon as those bubble guts and cold sweats kick in, we're on our way to get well again. But, do you still want to be shackled by something, daily? Always having to worry if you have your fix. Your life revolving around something that isn't apart of you, but an addition to your life. 

I've already have realized things about myself, that I had tucked away for so long. And it's only been 2 weeks. I'm now thriving on bettering my self everyday. Whether it be physical, mental, or spiritual, everyday should end with a new improvement, or progress in improvement. 

These are just my thoughts on this subject. Something I've been racking my brain on for the last 2 weeks.",1500035352.0

I first got into pain pills about 10 or so years ago. My husband (at the time) introduced me to them and I eventually got hooked. At my worst, I was taking 12-20 percs a day. Granted I was 105 pounds. It would cause me to throw up every single day. I would grind the pills up and then ingest them, so it would hit me faster and stronger. I couldn't function without them. I couldn't have fun. I couldn't work. I couldn't watch a movie without taking them. It was a horrible fucking existence. I was absolutely terrified of withdrawal. 

My husband and I split up when I was 27. However, 31 days after our divorce, he passed away of a methadone overdose at the age of 31. He had his whole life ahead of him. Full of potential. But instead, it was cut short.  We had our problems, but even he didn't deserve to die alone in his friends guest bedroom.

I have been clean off pills since January 2009. Granted I have still been on suboxone off and on since then,  I am happy to be where I am today.  I still think about my ex. Think about what he would have been if it weren't for drugs. He would have been 39 this year.

I run away from reality because i still think my mom leaving me is my fault

Ive been that boy.

Its not my fault. but its on the edge of my mind tugging at my thoughts

The same ones that command my mind to search for a reason to do dope

I got kicked out of my house at 18

Its been a while since; i had a job i had things going for me.. 

Then i started to wither because nobody has ever been there for me because i dont know how to do the likewise

And it hurts becaause on top of all this emotional shit i have to survive in a world that i was doomed to die in anyways

So living has been hard..

..Dope had been so easy

Tbh i know logically yes I will be amazing if i do me, but the heroin is doing me.

The journey though is life or death

And ive been playing on the edge for too long

For all the little stuff on the edge i play with it is the same in maximum. If it makes sense if the unisverse just came to Be then that means its small aswell. Because of time we can be Beings. The minimum the universe the maximum of what itll become. My life is too small to fuck with like that. Its time to start Being

Its time to step down. Ive been sober for 5 days now and the wd are getting easier and easier. When that voice tugged on me i visited my moms grave. Today i bought food for my family.

Today, I got a new batch from my go to connect, and he had the E7 fifteens. He's never had those before, but said his pharmacy changed what they stock. He got them from the pharmacy yesterday, and they all weigh almost exactly 110 mg. 

Can anyone find the chart that a fellow user posted with the weights? I've had no luck searching.

FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! anyway this morning was a groggy morning. woke up lazily around 10ish. 11ish there is a knock at my door. nobody ever knocks on my door unless i am expecting someone and i was def not expecting anyone. i ask who is it. they dont bother to answer or wait for me to open the door. forced it open. two black dudes push me to the floor and one gets on top of me with a gun at my head. im too shocked to even process what is going on.


the money where is the money they demand. hits me on the side of my head with the gun. ouch. oh money you want...its in my pocket. had about 100 bucks in cash in my pocket. they took it. fucking took my blanket off my bed tried to fucking wrap me in it did a bad job taped my feet and hands i thought fuck they are going to kidnap me i didnt have enough money or some shit.


they go through my room and dump everything on the floor. find some usb sticks and my broken tablet and took that. kicked me a few times and said dont move for a half hour. left quickly out the same way they came in. 


fuck that i undid myself and went running outside to try and see if i could get any info on them. they were gone too quickly. 


now this is the second time i have been robbed in two months. i moved out of my last place and found a supposedly much more secure place. yeah right. they busted the door open in two seconds. im not even staying there tonight. 


anyway i am living here in ecuador and have been living outside the us for over 6 yrs never ever had any bullshit happen like what happened to me today, and just need a place to vent.


i am sooooo lucky i didnt have more cash in my room, as i live here on a cash basis only, no bank accts. so they actually got all my cash except a 20 i had stashed in some random pants pocket, luckily. anyway used that money to eat and get on the internet to have some cash wired to me. found another place waaay on the other side of town its spendy too. hopefully secure but fuck me i am never keeping any real cash on me ever again. 


going to get out of this town soon enough and move somewhere else but the insecurity is everywhere here. i tried to file a police report they wouldnt even let me make the denuncia just told me no le van a hacer caso those fucking crooked dumb ass pathetic excuse for policias.


anyway im thankful it could have been worse and wasnt. also im sort of superstitious and any time the 13th rolls around it seems like it is a bad day. i try to not make it like some kind of self fulfilling thing but fuck me if today isnt the 13th! 


anyway be safe folks and enjoy your drugs. i might take one extra pill tonight just to kill a little bit of the anxiety. ",1499987932.0

I was addicted to amphetamines for years and was suicidal on and off for at least a few years total. Fucking sucked. Ironically, I got a great job now because I got straight A's (amphetamines do that to you) despite being depressed. I quit now for 2-3 years approx. I tried MDMA recently for the first time more recently. MDMA and mushrooms are the only things I may do again in my life. I would be open to doing heroin or morphine if I actually needed it for pain. or xanax for anxiety. But otherwise, I am steering clear mostly. Drugs have soaked up too many lost oppurtunities in life.

Anyways; I saved up money and after my graduation a few months ago, I travelled Europe. I was in Amsterdam briefly. I visited museums and took city tours.

I was wondering if the people of this would think this law would help them?
https://news.vice.com/article/only-in-the-netherlands-do-addicts-complain-about-free-government-heroin
To save you reading the article, basically, if you feel that you really can't get clean, and you genuinely have tried, the netherlands govt gives you free shots of heroin 2-3 times a day. You go to a clinic and get your shot. The tour guide said that 80% of people in the program hold full time jobs. Which is why I looked it up online. The guide also explained that most of the youth sees how opiates almost ruined the generation before them, and addicts get their shots at the public clinics. So they stay far away, and heroin is no longer a huge issue. The addicts interviewed in the article complained that they felt ""cast out"" by society. Some of them just take their shot and go home and lay on the couch all day, and the program stops them from getting clean

I am against the idea of the welfare state. Hence I am against the law for that reason. I think that giving free heroin is silly and sends the wrong message. I DO think that the drug war is stupid though. As such, I see legalization as the better long term idea. I also think that if it were legal, it could be cheaper and purer. As such, I would support a system where users go to a clinic and get their shots and pay for it with their own money. From my lurking on this sub, people spend 50-100$ a day on serious heroin habits? I am curious what the upper limit to that is? As an amphetamine addict, people judged me. I didn't hurt anyone. I never stole. I just blew absurd amounts of adderal, and ritalin. Lots of nicotine and caffeine. I ruined my own health and I needed help. I think if my friends judged me less that would have helped me get clean much quicker. And in my opinion, support is the biggest obstacle I had. I think this is the most important change

So I had some questions for this sub/tl:dr;
**do you think that if US implemented a similar system, your life would improve? Free heroin at a clinic at set times everyday administered by a doctor? Do you think that this would stop you from getting clean? Or make it easier? To take that question further, do you think that if it costed 10-20$ (what I imagine heavy cig smokers pay on cigs) to get pure heroin and clean needles for daily functioning, could you hold down a job? Have kids? How much do HEAVY addicts blow in a day in the US on heroin/oxy?**",1499986018.0

I just turned 24 in June, been using since I was like 16. lost everything. no car, no job, ive done shit im not proud of, blah blah we all know how that story goes. been to rehab literally more than like 20 times. been to hospital. been to jail numerous times. tried moving far away to different states to ""start over."" tried meetings, tried halfway houses, tried suboxone maintenance. Ive tried everything. I am trapped. There is no way fucking way out. Im at the point where I have officially fucked myself up. BIG TIME. Literally as if there is no turning back. My tolerance is so fucking high that Im screwed. I cant explain it enough. Last 2 times I went to rehab it was a sub detox and subs did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for me. no exaggeration. I was still sick as fucking hell, I couldnt even drink water. I fortunately found a methadone detox but its only 20mg first day, 10mg second day, 5mg third, then done. I stayed maybe one day then left cuz I was so sick. Point is - every rehab does a suboxone detox and they dont do jack shit, and the one rehab that does methadone isnt a high enough dose, not to mention its a trash hole where people have sex and sneak drugs in.

**and no, I dont think its right and I think its fucking sickening what some ppl do, but its just interesting to learn and watch stuff about it and basically enter the mind of a psychopath n wonder why the fuck they do what they do.** (I know Im not the only one...)

too scared to actually ENTER the dark web myself, but if you guys know some cool creepy scary paranormal fucked up murder videos n whatever, lmk! 

/huff paranormal on youtube is pretty sick if ur into all that paranormal investigating stuff, btw/

I was shit out of luck with nowhere to go, addicted to a wide variety of drugs. I called up my girlfriend and she came over with her van to pick up all my belongs. I remember smoking hella tar and passing out in her vsn for the night. The Next morning I went to a local storage unit facility and got a $40 a month unit and put all my shit in there. I had like 10 blankets, 4 pilliows, 3 comforters, my bike, clothes, and other miscellaneous items. The pillows and comforters provided useful...

.            So this was a fairly large compound with just 2 very long rows of units, a big ass entrance and exit gate, Semi trucks and Rv's, and security cameras decked out. Not to mention the owners of the facility lived right over the main office which was at the entrance. So obviously you can't just rent a storage unit and live/sleep in it but if you are desperate as fuck and sneaky like me you can pull it off. I would sneak up to the exit gate at night and climb over it, sprint past the first camera, duck behind a semi, James Bond it past another camera and open my storage unit and climb inside. I had a key pad lock which i would just leave unlocked but disguise it like the unit was locked. 

.          It was a depressing month where i pissed in bottles in the dead of winter sleeping in a storage unit. Leaving in the morning provided unbelievable paranoia and anxiety about getting caught. Luckily they usually had the gates open during the day. But the cameras were still on watch. I ended up getting a crazy job driving illegal Mexicans around the country and putting up horse stalls. Stayed in hotels and saved up enough money for a car. Which is where I slept many times in the years that followed. But that's for another story. Still amazed the people that worked at that storage unit never caught me. Or they knew and felt really sorry for me. I will never know. 

.       So where is the worst place you have ever slept,? For a night, week, or even a month like me??? ",1499977492.0

But once I let it sit a little longer and I noticed it solidified in the syringe. I forced the water/heroin mixture out into my cooker and I was left with a little white puck.

I began to experiment a little and let the liquid cool back into the cooker and it was almost like the texture of bacon grease. Now I am very worried that I've done permanent damage to my body over the last 36 hours.

If my last dose of an SSRI was Monday morning does /r/opiates think it would be safe to try 50mg of the Tapentadol for backpain and a buzz if I get lucky? Or should I wait 15 days after the final dose like it is recommended to do before using DXM or MDMA?

Update/Edit: I dosed one 50mg an hour or so after this post. I didn't feel much but it helped my pain some. Today I took 4x 50mg Tapentadol because I had woken up with severe pain in my back. I then actually got some nice rest and a calming buzz. I would not compare it to Oxycodone or Hydrocodone but it's good if your tolerance is low.

Went to cold cop and ended up linking up with this homeless kid who was around my age, and seemed like genuinely nice kid. He helped me get two buns for 60 and i threw him a half bun for free cause im on the vivitrol shot (was my 29th day) so its not like im desperate for every last drop of dope, and even when i was in addiction, i will always take care of someone if they help me out. in a junky junk world i find it rare to find kids like the one i met yesterday who dont scam on me or rob me and i hold that and loyalty above all regards. So we get the two buns and are walking to an abando to do a shot when we come across these middleman/ wanna be dealers who the homeless kid knew but wasnt exactly found of them. so they keep following us on bikes to the abando claiming they have raw dope, and some other really good stamp and that they want me and him to try it for free, so us both being naive we say why not and they follow us behind the abando. So i start taking out couple bags and the mid tier scammers start trying to ask to look at my stamps and im already getting sketched out by this cause both of them are like swarming me. Finnally one of the scammers puts two xanax bars in my hand and is like let me just look at those stamps (had 3 in my hand) so i let him look at them and he immediately just puts them in his pocket and is like u owe me more next time for the xanax. I didint even agree on a trade it just kinda happened and being the bags were like 3$ each and 2 bars would be like 10-15$ normally, i didint really care was just kinda like wtf. So then his other scammer boy who is much stockier and a bigger dude starts asking me to check out what stamps i got and i hold one bag for him to see but far enough that he cant grab it and his hand is going closer and closer to the bag, when all of a sudden the first skinnier one grabs my wallet out my pocket so fast i dont know whats happening, but i realize it fast enought that i grab him by the collar of his shirt and yank him back towards me. At this point he kinda realizes im about 100 pounds more than him (im 250lbs and 23 years old, dont look like your average user, and he was probably 130 or so and about 50 something years old) so he notices ill kick the shit out of him and starts saying im just joking im just joking, but isnt giving the wallet back. so then his stocky friend jumps in now and starts saying let go of him and im arguing back and forth saying give me the fucking wallet first. finally the homeless kid im with notices whats going on and so does this other really nice older man who was in the corner smoking crack when i got there and they both get up to try and defend me. while this is happening i still have the skinny one yoked up by the collar and he takes my cash out the wallet and throws the wallet on the floor and kicks it. (had about 215$) Then all of a sudden the stocky one puts the handle of his knife to my head and is like let go of him and give me the bundle in your pocket, any money, and take ur earings and chain off and sneakers. At this point the homeless kid i was with steps back and is like i cant do anything bro, but the older man who was smoking crack is still telling them get the fuck off him give the man his money back. Finally i get a burst of rage and knock the knife and it goes flying. When the skinny guy goes to pick up the knife the stocky one holds me up against a corner. The knife happened to fall where u could see to the front of the abando and as soon as the skinny one picks it up he says oh shit cops are out front. The stocky one lets go of me out of fright and i deck him hard as i can in the nose and he starts leaking falls back and takes off running out the front of the house following his skinny scammer friend. The cops tell them to stop but they peddle away and now the cops r coming into the house. So me, the homeless kid, and the older gentleman are stuck making a split decision if to brush past the cops and keep chasing them, or cut my losses and run out the back so we dont end up possibly being searched and arrested and make situations even worse. So we cut out the back avoid the cops and immediately start searching for them. We end up searching for them for about 4-5 hours when it starts to torrentially downpour and i decide fuck it i have to go home and take the bus. While we were searching though we each got about 3-4 tester bags and about a 20 bag of crack each cause we walked past so many dealers trying to get our attention to cop, and we would tell them i was just robbed and they would say well heres a sample for next time you have money. Also luckily i got to keep the rest of my 15 bags and in my wallet in a secret compartment i had 150$ that they didnt find. The situation could have been way worse but it was still really bad and even tho i have money left, bags, and get paid another 650$ in 3 days on saturday im still bummed the fuck out, constantly just thinking of different ways the situation could have been avoided or handled differently and am like super depressed. To top it all off the vivitrol shot has barely even worn off 29 days later and i barely felt any high from 12 bags within like 18 hours. This was also first time ive had a physical confrontation while being robbed. In the past when i get beat ive usually gotten fake shit or was stupid enough to let my money walk away without a return product. Any ways if any of you have some encouraging advice or maybe share some similar stories you have it would help alot, im super depressed at work and its not like i can even get high if i want to off the 3 bags just sitting in my pocket.

It felt great and I had the best paying job I've ever had on top of it so I really thought I had it all figured out . I figured I would reward myself for doing so well by just getting high once . It'll be fine right ? Well of course my dumbass got deep back into junk the first week . I dove in head first and started back up with the everyday morning noon and night shots around the clock . Before I knew It I was back up to shooting half g a day on average and even though I had been making so much it was barely enough to feed the habit .  My girlfriend at the time was getting clean and I was hiding my use from her . I started spending through my 700 dollar a week checks and still needing to pawn my PlayStation every week as well just to stay high . It wasnt long before I lost my job and everything was in pawn . My girlfriend had found out I was full of shit and left me . I had run out of stuff to pawn of my own so I started stealing from my family on days where I was shy on cash . I felt like shit for it but what could I do . I used because I was despressed and I was depressed because I used . Next thing I know a few months had passed by and I couldn't find any other work because I was too strung out . I simply existed in my home day and night shooting up with my cat . My parents had stopped letting me come over because of the theft and I had nobody at this point . I figured I had fucked up my life so much and then fucked up my last chance at happiness by relapsing as well . I made the plan to kill myself 3 months ago from now . I had enough for a gram and I was going to just bang it all at once and go down the way I lived , a lonely junkie . I was about 3 hours away from making the deal to get the bag I would do it all with when my dad came over . He was pissed . He hasn't ever used drugs and was so confused why I don't just stop . We talked all day and then I told him I had to go somewhere (I was going to score and off myself) . He knew what go somewhere meant and he had finally had enough . I shit you not right there he froze my bank account and told me if I left and got high he was going to report my car stolen (it was technically in his name) . I was kindof out of options and pissed tbh . I just wanted to die and he quite literally made it impossible for me . It was 6 days of hell with nowhere to go and not a dime to my name nothing left to even pawn off . I got on the vivitrol shot on the 7th day clean and now I'm at 3 months going on 4 without so much as a glance at an opiate . I got a job I love and I am happy to be alive again . I didn't think it could be done . I thought I would never escape that hell I had made for myself . This time I made the right life changes to stay away for good and I have never been so happy in my whole life . I wrote all this thinking that maybe someone who is in that place can see it and realize there are other options . I thought death was my only choice . I'm so glad I never got the opportunity to buy that bag that day . Do whatever it takes just please don't do what I wanted to do . You can get your life back . If I can do it anyone can . For some reason all the overdoses and the multiple suicide attempts didn't end it . I'm here for some reason still and a lot of my friends aren't . I just hope someone who is doubting themselves can realize if a lowlife like me can enjoy life again then literally ANYONE can do the same . Much love from a former junkie to anyone hurting . It can get better ",1499962412.0

I was not aware he was using again and thought he was clean after having rhabdomyolysis in September.  He lost use of half of his leg at the point and was walking with a cane.  When I went to his apartment to clean it up before my mom saw it there was so much blood in the toilet.  I assumed overdosing would be painless and just sort of fall asleep.  Why would there have been so much blood in the toilet.  He died alone which makes me so sad.  Not sure why he didn't reach out to me as I have a lot of resources available which I would have utilized to help him.  Is the blood thing common?  Was he in pain?  Did he not reach out due to embarassment?  I am just so confused and miss him so much.",1500124603.0

-NEVER ASK HOW MUCH IT COSTS!!!
I have made this mistake a few times and the set will sometimes think you are a cop if you ask too many questions. Just try and get an estimate for what your drug of choice should cost and trade money for drugs. If it is too little then trust me, they'll let you know.. sometimes they even hand money back if it's too much.

-Check the ground for wax bags or colorful bottle tops or needles:
Honestly a poppin set will be littered with contraband within a couple blocks of wherever those drugs are. Find these and you are close to the new pick up spot

-again a good set will have look out boys..

A man on a bike that seems to be just enjoying the cool breeze or the sun in his face? Probably a look out boy.. some guy sitting on the stairs outside of the projects and he isn't on his phone or really talking to people?? You guessed it.. a look out boy!

He is on his mothers health insurance so she got a report from them seeing what they gave him and knew he overdosed on opiates and now she thinks he has an addiction. She's trying to get his medial records but because he's of age she has no legal right to them. However she could get a police report because that is public record. My question is, did they even file a police report? The police didn't ask me much of what happened. The only thing they wrote down from me was my name, his name, and my phone number. They didn't ask me anything else and they just had me flush whatever was left of the pill down the drain they didn't interrogate me, take pictures, or confiscate anything. They also didn't ask him anything. The medics asked him a few questions about how much he took and how often he takes it but I can't remember if the police were marking any of that down as I was an emotional wreck at the time.

Chapter: Endless Ancipation (aka The Waiting Game)


""THE SCORE""

It's 6am and all I can think about is scoring heroin...I'm not sure how I ended up in this situation, wait....that's a lie. I know exactly how this escalated to black tar. I followed that curious cat down the wrong alley, tripped, slipped and fell nose first into a pile of brown powder...well,fuck me....let's get this show on the road.

630 am ""maybe he's awake, should I try calling?"" 

 I mean, the sun is almost up and he MIGHT be up....That's the logic of an addict, I know damn well he won't be awake for at least 4 more hours..and that's still not likely, my call log is more like a continual spiral into drug craving madness.

While my cravings are completely mental, that voice in my head just won't shut the fuck up...That gorilla on my back weighs 800 lbs and he's a mean fucker when he doesn't get his way. He's a master manipulator and will speak to you smoother than a seasoned pimp mackin to a fresh bitch on the track. He's taken up residence on my left shoulder, like a belligerent squatter refusing to leave. At times he's calm and smooth and can give me all the right answers when I need to make excuses about my drug use and where all the money I've made is......but he's Bi-polar as a muthafucka. In a flash he can transform into the raving uncontrollable beast that brings me into the abyss of self destruction..

For the past 3 days he's been on a rampage, he knows my drug break is up...he was on a warpath until I tricked him back into his cage.

 About 3 weeks ago I told my dealer to cut me off...this was after several scary black outs at home, my girlfriend definitely knew I was fucked up on something.... Xanax and heroin can throw you into a helluva stupor...if you are reading this you have either been in one or have seen someone in one. This is the walking zombie syndrome, when the nod takes over and you fall asleep standing up...mid speech...in the middle of the he meal..it doesn't matter, you will only know it's hit you when you snap out of it.

Like an extra in ""the walking dead"" your body is there but your mind and soul are ultimately gone

This is known as the ""dope fiend lean "" and it defies all logic of balance, some people will be full on touching their toes while nodding out while standing...others turn into bobblehead dolls and their heads just dangle about. I was the walking dead...slamming into walls, almost crashing through the shower doors and shattering them in the bathroom. .. I snapped a chair in half after collapsing into it...it was pretty scary that she saw and heard me like that. If she catches me I'll lose her...there's no coming back from ""oh yeah by the way I got a small problem, it's heroin but I promise to stop""

Knowing damn well I wouldnt...

""THE ANTICIPATION ON PLEASURE OR PAIN IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE REALITY OF IT""

As I sit here thinking that the high I'm chasing is some fantastic orgasmic feeling of pure euphoria, it's not...and it hasn't been for a long time. I use alone so the social aspect is gone, and having to hide the habit and the high is getting to be too much. How the fuck am I supposed to enjoy myself when I have to hide it?

The answer....a drug vacation day. I put in an order for 5 grams of black tar, knowing that the chances are slim of this happening the way I am planning it. Called in sick to work to score heroin and get high....Yeah I'm sick alright..sick in the fucking head. One day this whole shit show will be exposed to the world and they will know my secret. While I clean up nice and can play  chameleon on most situations to blend in, I'm sure everyone I know has caught me in a nod once...and I've been able to blame my insomnia for most of it.

See, I've battled insomnia ever since my last long term relationship...and it was with that bitch Crystal. See, before brown sugar was my sweetener of choice I dabbled into the world of high grade stimulants. Beautiful shards of all shapes and sizes were crushed and sniffed or smoked. My girlfriend at the time liked it, and I was trying to play it cool and party with her even though it wasn't my thing.

See, the stint I served in the Amphetamine Penitentiary was during a different era, we didn't have the quality these tweekers have...our shit was just that, shit.

 Crank was a filthy predecessor of crystal meth around the 90s, but it was what we had. Rose, Peanut butter, and others dirty white powders were the flavors available. We didn't have these magnificent  shards of glass that looked like they were stolen from a chandelier...we had shit that tasted like it was made in a motel bathroom. You could see the pink from the benadryl they were using...sometimes the dope would still be wet. Leave a line of this stuff on a CD case too long and it would seemingly begin to eat away at the plastic ...and we happily snorted this shit by the boatload with no concern.

I didn't enjoy smokin meth because it never really got me high like everyone said...until one day. I was renting a room in these shitty apartments by the freeway, most are occupied by section 8'ers or dopefiends...I ended up with a section 8 dopefiend, such a winning combo

I was green to crystal meth and the glass pipe wasn't my specialty, she would fire it up and tell me when to hit it...and after a few hits I got the hit that changed my life.

""Whoa....so THAT is what everyone is talking about!!!!"" as I feel a tingle just flow through my body like a low voltage electric buzz...we smoked more and fucked like rabbits until the next day. I was selling crystal at the time and had around an ounce or so usually with me at any time....until I broke the commandment of ""never eating high on your own supply""
Little did she know I was barely sleeping 3 hours a night after that, and was smokin my way into meth psychosis.  I was able to hide it well enough, but what happened was just more of us using together. She wasn't hooked but liked to party...so I played along. While we'd get high on the weekend together...

""First me and Crystal on saw each other on the weekends,

But now Im hiding my tweekin

 and seeking her out everyday in between em""

And that's how I ended up on meth for about a year or so.

I sit here at Ocean Beach and watch the waves roll in and outt... pop another xanax to hopefully calm the beast....and wait.
I picked up some good weed from the club to try and calm King Kong down for awhile. They called the stuff Gorilla Glue,ho fitting,hopefully it will do the trick... the names of weed nowadays is pretty interesting...hopefully this glue will keep my mind stuck on something other than heroin.

As I smoke my joint and watch the waves flow, I feel the warmth of the sun on my face and for a split second I forget all about dope and just enjoy the view..the weed elevates my mood for the moment and I'm at piece...

I look down at the halfway burned  joint and mumble to myself ""this shit is the bomb"" I drift off into a dreamy haze with the sound of the ocean and seagulls. For a brief moment I forget about heroin and fall into the comfortable bliss of the xanax and weed...it's such a beautiful day, I remember so many good times here. My car engine still running, I pass out and let time fly.....worry free 

And then the beast jolts me from my slumber....fuck, did I miss his call? How long have I been asleep....? FUCK!

It's now 1130 am....is he awake yet?  By my logic it should be a decent time to try and call someone...or maybe not? I dialed his number and listen.....one ring....2 rings, 3 rings..

The 4th ring means he not answering and inside I pray he answers.

""YEAH...what's up? ""   

Why does he bother asking this?

You know what the fuck is up, I need to get high because I sure the fuck didn't call to say good morning, make small talk, and discuss the weather. 

""It's all good but you gotta wait until around 3 to get it""

A four hour wait for heroin feels like 12 hours in my mind, but what can I do? I make sure to remind him I need 5 grams, because he'll forget and only have 2 to spare. He sounds annoyed but at this point I don't give a fuck, I want my dope....

It could be worse, I could be left to scouring the streets of the Tenderloin and taking my chances with strangers hopin for a friendly face....which is an endless roulette wheel of possible rip offs. I should be thankful that I have a direct phone number to the devil himself and he answers my calls for the most part.

How can so much emotion and joy be created by this small ball of black goop. This sticky tar has so much power to be just an inanimate object..once it touches you, there are thousands of unseen teeth that sink deep into your soul. 
Heroin has no soul, but it can permeate yours and cause it to disintegrate rapidly and causes necrosis of the soul. When Im high, nothing matters...I am numb to the world and my mind is no longer racing with madness.

I enjoy the bliss off slipping in and out of a conscious reality and into my personal dreamland. In a nod..a single thought manifests into a  detailed dream, each new nod takes me down another rabbit hole in my twisted mind. But the true bliss is the complete numbness to anxiety, worry, stress and fear..

It's funny how this can ease the pain on life in an instant. The most stressful day is instantly relieved once that double wrapped plastic package is secured. After 3 days of a drought and no connections, today felt like fucking Christmas and Junkie Jesus smiled upon me. 5 grams of tar and I'll get through another couple of days before the carousel begins again.

The cycle of addiction is hard to break when the monkey lives on your shoulder and is constantly whispering sweet nothings in your ear....life itself doesn't feel the same without hop and I hate that my peace of mind and happiness is routinely based on copping. I try and pass the time by reading stories on r/opiates to help me realized I could be in a much worse situation..

I could be using dirty toilet water to try and get a hit from old cottons, or I could be puking my guys out and I fully blown withdrawal shitting on myself in a SRO in the TL. I'm not trying  to say my struggle is worse than anyone elses, because I know it isnt...but it is still a struggle for me mentally and controls me more than I would like it to..and this is just my story.

36 phonecalls in a single day to the same number are a clear sign of a problem, and I sit here and wonder how much of a dopefiend he sees me as. See, my dealer is also one of my best friends....while dope brought us together, we formed a bond and treat each other like real family..a twisted misfit bunch of dysfunctional addicts. We don't just meet up for transactions, we actually hang out and have a friendship..

This friendship of course gets rough when the main dope man aint around, he can't cop, meaning I can't either and it turns into phone tag and text relays.

Yeah, I could hit 16th or head over to the TL and try and cold cop....but I got a family, a job, and a lot to lose if I were to get busted. My boy Irish aka Big Rich was my sidekick in the L's, he knw every spot, every dealer and could get us some action within few blocks of browsing.. Rich died alone in an alley in the Central Valley during a relapse and overdosed. Xanax and Heroin killed my boy.

And that's the same combination in my system now.....I pray for the strength to break free from this. I've done it before, it can be done again.

Until that day comes, I'll live this life day by day....praying for the courage to face life without the need to escape reality, but to face it head first without a crutch.

There is something in life I have yet to discover that will mean more to me than getting high...I struggle daily to find and accept this, and pray for the epiphany that will save my life in the long run.

Until then I'm taking my spare change, tossing it into my pill bottle with some mannitol and a chunk of black tar and drift off into my personal land of peace....without worry, anxiety or the ability to give a fuck for a few moments of incoherent bliss...

May God grant me another day of life and allow me to wake up from my self inflicted euphoria....

Thank you for reading.....you are not alone..

And I got banned from the grocery store by my house for life because, 'I'm bad for business.' 

I had to call off work tonight to take her to the ER, her bone was exposed and it was disgusting so I figured I should do the right thing and force her to go because she kept saying she was good to just go to work. But, there was blood, so much of it. And she kept claiming to be lightheaded. 

So I spent my night in the ER. 

And I got repaid for trying to do the right thing, which I'm starting to think I never actually do the right thing... but I got repaid by having her pass out on the belt of a cash register while I ran to my car for more money. 

I've been doing better. I'm not clean, but I don't use as much and try to go as long as possible without in an attempt to try to taper myself. It's much harder quitting when its constantly in your house. So, I've been proud of myself. 

But, I guess since she OD'd I fucked up, at least thats what she keeps telling me. 

I give up on life. Idk what to do anymore, I just want to attempt a normal life but I'm scared if I do my mom will end up dead and I'll feel guilty. 

All I want to do is work, and furnish my damn house, get laid, and binge watch Netflix. But, guilt and fear rule my life so I'd rather use always secretly hoping its my last line. I'm never lucky enough though. 

I just needed to vent, life is really kicking my ass today.

As I sit pondering the ways in which I’ve become (in)famous, over a nice jazz piano jam and herbal remedy, I just hope that they can forgive me. I hope she can forgive me. I just become such pure,  concentrated garbage when this heavily addicted to any substance. “This isn't me”, I tell myself, as well as them. I’d sit in jail on a bed of nails and get clean before I’d make them believe me. It just isn’t happening. Too many days gone by spent high, too many bridges burned. Lately I feel like tossing my own urn off the old railroad trusses behind my house where I spend my best days, in high or sober ways.

---

I once had the best moment of pure euphoria on the aforementioned railroad bridge after a serene walk with my best friend. (so long dude. I drove you away for good). I’m sure the fentanyl had little do with both, right? Yeah. Fucking right. The devil was inside my bones, but I felt better than I have ever felt. I felt invincible. I was the prototypical me, I created things. I was a master. I wrote poetry which would blow you away, and I didn’t even know where the words came from. I was applying for manual labor jobs, something I had never even tried or considered as a skinny ass emo/skater dude all my life. 

I was driving trucks even though just being in a car used to make me a nervous wreck. My family was happy for me. It looked like I had turned over a new leaf. I had stopped smoking pot, which was something I had done for years straight. It’s a possibility it made me lazier somewhat, I’m not denying that. When I quit I didn’t even do it on purpose, it was just that this other drug was so good nothing else mattered. Fuck coffee. Fuck weed. Fuck even eating real food, give me a fentanyl lollipop and some ice cream. That is all I ever craved food-wise was ice cream. It’s in a class of its own. (I’ve seen my own father who is on the same drug eat gallons of the stuff. It’s really a spectacle.)

I woke up one morning and realized I felt too sick to even get out of bed and reach for my fent patches, I had hidden slyly hidden under my audio receiver. In retrospect, what kind of hiding place is that? (considering I have an audio nerd for a father). There was not much logic going through my head in this period. However, there were many songs in my head. I wrote ballads that seemingly were beamed down to me from the nether realm, because I don't know where the hell those words came from. The notes just slid off my fingers while playing guitar too. It felt like cheating. “Now I know...”, I thought, “how all those junky artists created such brilliant things.” I had discovered the cheat code to life, and it was incredible. 

At night though things took a turn, I became alone and trapped. When my company was gone, which was rare during this time, I would just nod out on the couch watching adult cartoons through the corner of my eye every 10 minutes when I could manage to open them. I was fucking strung out like hell. I had a nearly infinite supply of the strongest legal for human use, opiod on the market. I was chewing those damn patches like gum, and my friends must have thought I was insane when trying to explain. “Oh it’s just a little pain patch, hehehe”… What a joke. Somehow these friends stuck by me, for now. They didn’t realize the scope of what I had done to myself as I did. I had become a full-on opiod junky, and the worst part of it was I was completely aware of it. It isn’t like the naive old lady who goes to the doctor for Percocets and becomes dependent. She hasn’t studied the exact psychology/pharmacology that goes into addiction. I feel like it honestly made it worse that I understand *why* I was hooked. ”All this dopamine I’m lacking here without chemical influence”, and, “if only I weren't a treatment resistant chronic depression and anxiety case before the junk”. All these justifications like this we have to continue using don’t mean shit at the end of the day, when we lay our heads down yet again as an addict. 

One day, my best friend and also roommate called me as he usually would around 7:30A.M. “Hey bro, you ready?” It was time for one of our early morning classes at the community college we were now attending. God knows I already fucked up the whole university deal. I had just gotten out of sitting in a bathtub, trying to calm down my extreme lack of temperature regulation. Sometimes during withdrawal the few seconds of warm water are your only refrain from the pain and agony.

 I reluctantly agreed that I was in fact ready even though I felt like death on a stick. I was testing out how sick I would get without fentanyl today. My friend pulled up in a few minutes, and I got in the car. He asked me for a drink of my water. “Wait, are you sick?”, he asked. My friend was a severe hypochondriac. “No, it isn’t that kind of sick”, I assured him. “Oh, well as long as you’re just dope sick...” Feeling like somewhat of a diseased leper didn’t seem to help my already unwell and agitated state. We drove out the loop of my blacktop drive, and I already had a bad feeling for what was to come.

We crossed the mountain via the great big interstate which connects our little rural village to the outside world. We are just simply a piss stop for the rest of the world, a cut off, isolated mountain town where everyone’s nosey about each other’s business, and the only actual businesses are pharmacies, Dollar Stores, and funeral homes. Oh, and churches of course. At least we do have God on our side... Except that we are all on doctored-ordered drugs (heroin isn’t huge here), beer or moonshine. I stare out the side of the passenger window at the beautiful mountains below and think how I used to get stoned on top of the hill right above this interstate and just stare down at nature. Man, I wish I could appreciate things of beauty now. Everything looks fucking grey, it’s all the same. That’s the worst part about drugs, and it’s the same with all of them for me (even antidepressants). They zap the color from life.

Finally, we pull into the exit. Now if you think my description of my town sounds shitty, this is worse. It is considered one of the poorest areas in the state and also the meth hotspot for our county. There is only one main road, and we drive it slowly as to not fall into the speed trap. I can feel my stomach starting to turn now as I cringe at the McDonalds sign above. “hey bro, you want some mickey dees?”, my friend asks. “No.” I say with a firmness I have never used before. “I’ll just eat my trail mix”. I brought some because I can’t go without breakfast ever, even while a junky. I scarf down some M&Ms and peanuts and raisins, while trying to calm my anxiety with the soft guitar on the radio, courtesy of The Shins. (I was the source for all my friend’s musical tastes, an expert in his eyes).

Now we are pulling into the school, and the dread is coming to a head. It floats up my stomach and feels like love butterflies in my chest except they are black and rotten. As we are walking in, I see this really cute girl that sits across from me in class. I smile at her as we both turn our heads back towards the front of the school. At this exact moment, it hits me. I have to fucking throw up and I have to do it right now. I’ve heard this can happen in withdrawal though I have always had an iron stomach until today. I rush over to the curb, not more than twenty-five feet from the door and proceed to projectile vomit all over the crabgrass. Ah, that feels better. 

I wipe my mouth, and scoff it off as I walk inside and head to my class. My friend is simply shaking his head, and I still don’t know if that girl saw me. As I walk into the narrow corridors of the community college, I imagine just how mundane this really is. There must be hundreds of little schools that are built just like this, with as many mediocre classes and teachers too. Hey, it’s cheap.

I turn right into a door that appears the same as every other, and I’m in my class. I look at the teacher, and she immediately knows why we are late. These bloodshot eyes tell stories. I ask her for a piece of gum in front of the entire class, heavily implying that I just threw up everywhere. She told us to just go home, and so we did. 

---

Some more months of this cycle go by, as I slowly fall out of going to my classes, and then literally start falling out of life. My habit has gotten worse, fast. I’m now wearing and chewing fent patches, and rarely leaving the house for any reason. My friend and roommate is sick of my shit, and gone back to his grandparents. 

It was around this time I considered trying to get clean “for good”. I flushed all the remaining patches I had in a fit of rage. After this event at school and last night, I’m over it. I should explain that I fell out for the tenth time probably on the couch one morning, around 6am, after being in my usual nod state for the entirety of the night. I woke up to Hank Hill saying “damnit Bobby” and suddenly having to puke, as I gazed at my red hot foot right next to the space heater where I wore a patch or two. I probably had a piece of another in my mouth as well.

Fuck, my stomach feels like daggers are poking into it again, as I run dizzy to the bathroom, marking the very first time in my entire using career, even with future IV use, that I *ever* threw up from any opiod dose. I have a natural tolerance to all drugs somehow. As I sit in my sweat-soaked boxers, hugging and staring down into the toilet, I saw my pink and green stomach bile (the result of eating nothing but fucking tootsie rolls in the last day). It was around then I knew it was time for a change. However, little did I know change is hard to come by...",1500072198.0

The machine basically is a super efficient vaporization method to allow the ""harsh""* smoke to more easily be created, collected, & taken in. The machine involves taking a glass shot sized liquor bottle, stuffing the neck with either copper or steel wool (uncoated), and placing a tube into a hole drilled out in the bottom. 

Holding a lighter to the neck, you then use the many threads from the wool to evenly distribute heat from a lighter as you melt your DMT into the wool thus loading it. 

You can then smoke it by inhaling on the tube and pulling the flame into the copper so it's barely touching. It vaporizes perfectly and let's you take massive rips 

I'm wondering if the same thing would work with tar. Tempted to experiment cuz I've got a diamond drill bit and some empty Jameson mini bottles.

This last week or so has been hell. Found out that my wife has been using meth for months every day and hiding it from me. She might be cheating on me, but I'm schizo af and that might be a delusion. I almost got arrested for telling some dude that if he ever used my girl as a middleman for meth again I'd fucking strangle him. Dude deadass ran and called the cops. 

I know what ya'll are thinking rn. What?? She's just using meth why would you care your on a forum about doing heroin ffs. But there's a difference man, I never lied to her about what I do. I always shared with her even when she didn't pay for shit. I also have made very sure to make sure we are only chipping. Literally only buying about 2gs a month at the most. 

I've spent the entire day running around town, thinking that every car I seen was her's. Everytime I hear a woman speak it sounds like her. Everytime I call her phone the slight pause in between rings sounds like she answered. I think I might check into a mental health facility again. I don't know what to do. She's gone now.

Read this!,"A little bit about me, im a heroin addict, and a garbage head, been using on and off for 4 years, more recently ive been sticking to bud. I've been in 3 inpatient rehabs, and 6 outpatient. Ive learned a lot, just never was able to apply it to myself.

Getting off drugs is 100% mental power, no, your girlfriend, mom, or husband is going to ""get you off drugs"". It doesnt work like that. YOU need to make the choice to get off of that.

DETOXING IS FIRST, AND KEY!!!!; you can find detox locations everywhere, even at your local hospital. If you detox by yourself, your chances of getting through it and coming out sober is lowered. Most detox programs are 7-14 days, and its a very uncomfortable situation to be in. Find the mental power to push through it, and keep in the back of your mind that the pain is temporary, and every hour, youre working twords a drug free life.

The first thing you need to do is hit a meeting, you can find plenty of meetings here na.org
Meetings will give you a basic concept of recovery, and youll meet some really nice people looking to help you, and maybe even a sponsor. It took me 4-6 meetings to find 2 quality meetings i attend once a week, one is a HA, and one is NA

Depending on your situation, and financial availabilities, rehab could be an option, but you really need to search and make the right choice. I know one YOUTH rehab in massena, NY called -removed- , I would recommend it 

The 12 step program doesnt work for everyone. You may need other methods. Me personally, I think of my little cousin, Hes like a son to me, and hes seen it all. It helps me get back to reality and make rational decisions 

Recovery is a life-long process, and requires a lot of mental power to push through the rough times, but in the end its 10000% worth it, and deep down everyone knows that.

SLIPUPS DO HAPPEN, if they do, you can go inpatient, or just hop right back on track and continue staying sober. Getting back on the wagon is the hardest, BE OPEN at meetings, explain your situation, people will relate. REMEMBER YOURE NOT THE ONLY ONE GOING THROUGH THIS!

After getting clean, youll gain trust, your family/friends will start to trust you again and you will feel so much better physically.

Ill keep this as short and summarised as possible:

-Basically I am 23, studying at university (pharmacology) so I can get quite stressed balancing my intense studies and work. I live in the UK.

-In my senior year of high school I was going through a breakup, and I got injured mountain biking. I was prescribed codeine tablets and they made me feel relaxed and euphoric. For the next year to two, on and off I used codeine regularly (its OTC here) using CWE up to 1500mg doses. 

-This eventually lost its effect due to tolerance, so I started getting oxycodone from doctors. In the past year I had a 3 month break, then went back to codeine-->oxycodone, then I did what I thought id never do and try and use H. I currently work and study, so i dont earn much money, but when I do it all goes towards H (90% of the time insufflated, but I have tried intravenously a few times). It is just much cheaper and more euphoric too.

-Im not sure if im addicted, I know from a medical standpoint what it involves but from your subjective experience, at what point do you know? I often borrow money, tolerance is high and when i go without for 2-3 days i get insomnia, an internal irritation in my legs in which i have to kick/squeeze my leg muscles to relieve, loose bowels, bad nausea etc so I assume this is indeed withdrawal?

Am I on a bad path? (I mean I know its not good, but i havent suffered any consequences yet) I always assumed when i was younger i was immune to any issues with use, as i rationalized that my intelligence would prevail over it, and that many doctors in this country are ""hidden addicts"" that are functioning highly. Can people function highly on the path im on?

My SO relapsed tonight after a few weeks clean, I knew about this and I've been trying to advocate him staying clean while not forcing this concept. 
We did some coke tonight, he wanted some landing-gear. I have my prescription of a small benzo, so he picked up a half and split cost with his friend. I guess I've just gotta get this off my chest, I'm just shook over it.
Just earlier today we were talking about all it takes is one relapse, gone. I told him to never fear telling me if he was going to relapse, I needed to be there with him if he's going to make that choice. So if anything like this happened, I could do something to save him instead of him keeping it to himself out of shame and possibly dying alone.  I was just in active dope addiction last year this time. I know it's gotta be all them to want to get off and get straight. I'm doing what I can to rebuild my end, hoping I can take some financial weight off his so he can make decisions that will make a life for himself with a reason to hold on to sobriety. 
Sure enough, we're just watching a movie and he starts convulsing, losing color, ceasing up and choking. I get on top of him, start shaking him profusely, smacking his chest, screaming for him to come back. He came to about a minute after all that, I poured ice water all over his face. Still not a sharp reaction. 
He was slinking around on the floor, falling out, coming back, falling back out. His face was contorting, eyes rolling to the back of his head. I got on the line with 911, trying to get him to stand with me, put some clothes on. Checking for any drugs/paraphernalia. He's got an outstanding bench for a missed court date and before I knew it, he was dressed and out the door onto the street. (we live in an apartment in a big city, I lost him). When paramedics arrived, I had to tell them he ran off, apologized for wasting their time. 
Everyone in this forum knows how the opi-rage is. I got him back in the apartment, had to argue with him that he's got one try at sleeping normally or I've got no choice but to call again. At first he wanted to believe that I was spinning this out of proportion, but he came around and remembered that I've slept in the same bed for 4 years, I know when he's having sleep apnea and when he's not breathing on his own. 

He's sounding normal now, I guess running from the cops made him produce enough adrenaline to possibly swing him to the other side of an overdose. All I know is, no sleeping for me tonight.

We got in to our addictions together, and I'm not near the point of leaving him behind on getting straight. He's gotta come with me, on his own terms. Bright side is that he's started to see how great waking up feeling fine feels without trying to get a plan together for a fix. He's not going to withdrawal at this point if he stops now, so he's got an easy way out. Just say no to it from this point forward. This experience has seemed to make him understand that we have to both do this 100 percent, or possibly leave the other widowed. I received massive apologies for putting me thru this harrowing experience, got thanked multiple times for getting in to action as quick as possible. I wasn't having him die on me, not this night.

We could make several categories with names relating to the game like ""the frank Lucas award for most potent dope"" or the ""el chapo award"" for most ruthless dboy but as I thought about it more I thought this may be something fun to do once or twice a year make a bunch of threads pertaining to different aspects of the game and have ppl ""nominate"" their stories or dboy by commenting on the thread they're guy or story fits into. And then ppl vote (by upvote) who should win that category


Some fun categories could be

-craziest copping story of that year 
-dboy allstars ofnthat year
-best story of being scammed of the year 
-best hustle story of the year
-best come up of the year 

Let me know what you guys think of this and any other categories I may have forgotten. I'd like to keep this light hearted and fun as me and 40throw had a good laugh this afternoon.

So it would go something like this

-nomination thread for best come up of 2017-
Everyone tells there story or ""nomination"" and every one votes. at the end of voting who ever has the most up votes wins that category. 

I'm also taking ideas for the name of the awards show and the individual awards. I was thinking The Junks but I don't like it that much. well guys put in your 2 cents and lets see if everyone thinks this is a good idea

He's great - caring, intelligent, understanding, not to mention...stunningly attractive. All that jazz. He's the whole package. If it wasn't for my doomed outlook on life, I'd say I'd marry him. He's the one. 

But, he doesn't know about my habit. Or at least, he pretends not to know. He *might* know but is the type of guy that would not say anything out of wanting to respect my privacy (or just not wanting to know, blissful ingnorance, etc.) When we started dating, I only liked to snort pandas on the weekend (and for years before that, it was just once every few months or so). But over time... you know how it goes...weekends turned into ""just this one weeknight after a long day at work,"" and before I knew it, it was part of my morning ""get ready for work"" ritual- railing lines right after shitting, shaving, and taking a shower (well, shitting these days, not so much). I'm still snorting and haven't moved onto IV and don't plan to...but I'm not made of money and am already working side jobs to pay for my (expensive) daily habit. I've used every day since January, so I know I can probably quit this now if I really want to...but I don't want to. It makes me happy...or something close to it. I know how this story is likely to end - I'm not an idiot - but I've suffered from severe depression alongside a chronic pain disorder for several years. I just wanted to experience joy- and I have. I don't have regrets. Anyway, I'm blabbering now, and nobody is interested in a sob story.

So, my question is, have you told your SO about your ""secret"" habit? Does it always end in utter horror and rejection, or does it depend on the person? Obviously, it depends on the dynamics of the relationship, and everyone's mileage probably varies. But I'm seriously considering telling him. We don't have any secrets besides this, and this is a big one, especially since I started to be high around him. I feel guilty about it... like I'm hiding a big part of me. I try to only take a small maintainance dose when I'm with him, but a few times he's surprised me and caught me off guard. Once, he straight up asked if I was high. I denied it and laughed it off. 

We love each other, so I don't know if my disclosure will end things, or if he'll just ask me to ""get help"" or something. The problem is that I don't want ""help,"" at least not yet. Anyways, if anybody feels like sharing their experience, thanks in advance!

I moved to the other side of the world and got on methadone. I also don't hate myself for occasionally partaking in drugs that aren't my DOC. Everyone is different. I just happen to be (I hope I'm not wrong) one of those addicts that really is only weak to heroin. I smoke weed once every few days. Sometimes I snort a few lines of yay on the weekend. Alcohol is gross to me but a glass of nice wine at dinner is ok. And to me this thing with heroin is a war and everyday I don't use it is a battle won. Fuck what American doctors have to say about NO xanax no coke no weed. American doctors made me want heroin more and more. This Moroccan doctor is so reasonable and she gets it. 

On one hand she does treat people for weed addiction ( lol) but because I'm a h addict she knows it's extremely hard for me to find pleasure in things and lets me test dirty as long as it's not h. So far I'm alive. Healthier than ever. Job opportunities lined up. Grad school in the fall. Basically my point is whatever works for YOU. I think distancing myself from the environment was a huge factor. Every day that goes by the memory of the rush is harder to remember. I crave it in my dreams more than anything. 

I am about to move to Spain where there's plenty of h. I'm scared. But I can't stay hiding in morocco delaying my life forever. I've been here 5 months total since January. I have to swim or drown. 

Edit PS: methadone is not for everyone and I praise those who do it without maintenance but I cold turkey WDd so many times I just couldn't do it anymore. It's also not a magical solution if you don't wanna be sober. For those who would prefer not to be treated like a sub human piece of shit and not be able to travel I recommend kratom. ",1500144136.0

That's on me. It was my responsibility and the consequences are mine to deal with when I ran out. Yesterday I bought half a bun and my friend bought half a bun. That showed up in a rather timely manner. I also gave my friend a few extra bucks the other day to order subs a couple of days earlier.

&nbsp;

I need sub films because I'm going on a flight very soon. I've got a few more days but I really want peace of mind by knowing my friend has picked up the subs or that I have them in my hands. So he says that him and the local bar aficionado are picking them up this day. I could almost swear he used the word morning but I'm not naive enough to expect this to be done in the morning. It is said that the sub guy had them since yesterday but had a date so today is the day.

&nbsp;

The xanny aficionado just woke up so the next step is for him and my pal to go out together to get the subs. I'm tempted to text the guy my friend has to travel with to say ""I'm counting on the both of you to get those.."" I don't know if that will stand to screw things up or reveal a lie that I hope isn't the case. Furthermore the guy uses a lot of xanax so if I jump the gun he might show up at my friend's house early when they're not ready to travel to get the xannys that are being saved to get him out of the house.

&nbsp; 

My friend has gotten subs before so it's conceivable that he'll get them again but I'm still so worried. I'm scared that I'll get screwed and wont have subs in time for my flight. I'd prefer to start taking the subs a couple of days before my flight. Sure he's kind enough to offer me free H before work tonight. It's not like I'd take the sub before work. I'd wait till closer to the end of my shift because of the 24-hour wait. If I take H before work which seems likely now, I'll take the subs tomorrow.

My friend says he'll have the subs tonight one way or another. 
I really hope that's true. 

Not sure what I'll do if It's not. Perhaps get a cash advanced on a credit card and try to find subs on my own? There's so many ways this can go.. I gotta keep my inner pessimist in check for now but it won't hurt to take precautions.

Update: You bet I'm tripping. I'm now waiting on my friend who is waiting on dboy to bringsubs. This is plan B. i dont know what the fuck happened to plan A. I'm being tolf 95%...... I'm texting to finish an interruptrd convp we had in person.... he's saying ""it's DEF, I'll explain tonight."" to which i respond that i want the subs as promised. being told ill get an explaination tn along side tnat its definite does not instill confidence. 

&nbsp;

Good things are coming. i received good news.

In my last big update post (like, in March or April, I think?) I mentioned needing then having a pretty serious spinal surgery. At the time I was recovering and I thought it went off without a hitch.

Well, wouldn't you know it - there were a few hitches. In the interest of brevity and privacy let's just say that if a neurosurgeon tells you that your recovery time will be six weeks at the most... Well, you punch that cunt square in the balls and don't stop punching until the police show up.

I had the first spinal surgery in March and since then I've spent less than five days in my own house. Hell, they cut into places I didn't even know I had. *(I'm not gonna complain about the extra few inches of cock length and girth, but I am curious as to why I got them, ya know?)*

So, why the post now? Well, as stated above, I love you guys, but I'm, not plowing through tons of PMs to say the same thing over and over, and, more importantly, yesterday I got my final, ""Go Home - Fuck Off - We Ain't Treatin' You For Even a Fuckin' Hangnail Anymore,"" discharge papers.

Been lurking forever, this is essentially my first Reddit post. You guys rock!

So I ended up staying late at work tonight and have free reign of the machinery. I often make things for myself and pay for the materials I use and the owner is 100% cool with that. For obvious reasons, I haven't made anything drug related.

Tonight may be the night. If the right idea strikes quickly I would like to laser cut and engrave myself some subtle paraphernalia. Seeing as I currently sniff heroin off of leftover pieces of acrylic, I'd like to maintain that tradition while spicing it up.

Things:

-My roommate is quite literally never around, so there is little concern with anyone seeing whatever I make. Still, I don't want it to say ""HEROIN!"" on it. (Not sure why. My use may be closeted but *I* certainly know about it. I think I don't want to glamorize it or be reminded of its stigma, and instead just make my kit a tad classier.)

-Any color and size acrylic is available to me, and I can easily cut it precisely to any shape. 

-If you think of a design or shape for the sniffing surface (there must be word for that item?) or suggest an engraving design it would be great if you could include a link to a photo of the graphic. 

-Engraved text is cool, too. I was considering making a small container to keep my assortment of heroin bags in. That would likely be made of wood, and if I end up making that I think I would like to engrave on/in it a poetic metaphor for heroin and its effects, a la ""Nectar of the Gods."" Got anything good?

We both recently got clean. We had a habit we ran through for a little bit under two years that no one knew about.  It was an okay run but like all good things it had to come to an end. 

My mother found out about my habit and sent for me. She took me back home from our apartment and i went to an outpatient program for three months. I learned a lot and had to go every day a long with outside meetings. I admittedly drank some of the AA kool aid, in purpose of better understanding how and why addicts tick-tock the way we do. During this time my SO who was back up north still in our apartment decided to take things into his own hands and just stopped. He had multiple relapses and we both relapsed once together after seeing each other. Now hes had a bit of clean time and so have i. I still go to a speaker meeting and do lunch with old sober buddies from rehab once in a blue moon.  He just stopped. Plain and simple. 

During our ""run"" , my bf was noticeably more addicted and into it than i was. There were times where i would just stop and fall to my knees saying i cant do it anymore. Most of those times included him being very adament that he wont stop. Doesnt want to stop. Will keep going and thats it. Eventually i would get up and keep running with him and picked up my own pace. 

After i got caught i told him i was getting help with or without him and he needs to come clean to his parents so they can get a plan going for him too. I refused to leave the man i loved in the trenches of active addiction and told him ill support him but he needs help. After a week he agreed. Then told me he didnt need programs or help or anything. Just himself. Then he did just that. 

Some time passed with his relapses and our shared relapsed and some clean time to now. 

Lately ive been having the monkey on my back. Just horrible urges. I asked him what if i relapsed.

Guys, he said he would dump me like last weeks trash. 

I was hurt and astonished. This guys yelled in my face angrily on how much he loves to get high and will never stop. I knew it was just our brains and how fucked up we were. I still stayed around tho. I still continued going with him i didnt even leave him after i caught him getting high behind me back all those times. 

Now hes so ready to leave if i have a slip up. Im not planning to relapse or saying i will. Im just saying what if, then he drops me?

The other day my main people either were MIA or had really shitty dope. When I'm in times of need like this I will usually drive over to the west side and pick up a prostitute or homeless person to middle for me. It usually works out for the most part and I get my dope, and throw the middle $10 or more for helping me. So I pick up this prostitute named Kayla and she agrees to help me for a small fee. Usually I will wait in the car while said middle goes into some random trap house so cop. Hopefully the middle has some collateral like a phone or bag I can hold onto so I dont get robbed but it doesnt always work out that way. Anyways, Kayla insists I come in instead of waiting in the car. I happily agree. 

.            I walk into the trap house and there are about 20 crackheads and junkies sitting around smoking crack and shooting up. There are 3 thug lookin black guys weighing out dope and counting money.  The main dude Gucci, asks me if I'm a cop blah blah blah and interrogates me for a few minutes. He eventually figures I'm cool and sells me a $40 of some crazy good ecp and hooks it the fuck up. He tells me I can come back whenever I want and to start fucking with him. 

.      So for the past few days I have been going to the trap to buy my shit and Im amazed at the professionalism. Its legit a full scale operation where they mean business. Its open 24/7 with a few dboys rotating shift. The line is usually pretty long but I have never had to wait more then 10 minutes. I love it because they weigh it out in front of you, you dont have to call anyone you just come knock on the door and there is always someone there waiting to serve you, the dope is phenomenal and so is the amount given, and its just a breathe of fresh air not having to wait on anyone or hope that you can cop because they are always open for business.

I've tried buprenorphine and it didn't work too well. Abstinence is extremely difficult for me. So last week doctors pushed methadone on me really hard while I was inpatient for some skin lesions (somehow not related to IV dope) and they set me up with a clinic and free transportation to the clinic every morning.

So far It seems to be helping a lot with cravings and I haven't used dope since I started on the methadone. That said, I have 3 major issues. One is I am sweating profusely which is not exactly normal for me. Second I am extremely itchy all over and it feels like I have been bitten by thousands of mosquitos. The itching comes and goes, as does the sweating.
Third issue is I'm very sleepy and have slept more hours than I have been awake for the past week. I generally wake up at 7am, get my ride to the clinic and get dosed, then I'm fine for a while until maybe 2pm at which point I take a nap which ends with me waking up at 7pm for dinner, eating, then going back to sleep until morning. I started at 10mg and they already have me up to 35mg. I see the doctor at the clinic tomorrow and I'll be sure to mention the issues.

Mainly reading stories 2 remind myself of the past and 2 give me strength going forward.  I am going to keep this short.  If anyone wants to chit chat or what not just drop me a line and I will respond.  

When this all started I was in college pulling down good grades on the fast track to becoming...wait for it.... and FBI agent...LMAO

Started out just like everyone else.  Smoking herb.  Had an old Vietnam vet (weed dealer) offer me some Narcos for free... that lead 2 getting OC 80mg.  Next was crushing and snorting them.... then a friend (do we call them that???) offered to shoot me up... Then I learned how 2 shoot myself... Then I robbed my dealer... A lot more to that story.  Robbery is used really loosely.  More like he owed me and I owed him so I just took mine and left his... we chilled daily at his house so it was not uncommon 2 be there... He just bribed some junkie neighbor to say whatever he wanted. 

All of this was in 2002-2004.  Shooting up started round June of 04.  I was early 20's.  Had numerous junkie issues shortly after starting IV'ing Oxy.  One day I just decided to check myself into treatment (court cases had a hand in helping me make that decision).  

My second day in rehab they put me on 16mg of suboxone daily.  Long story short Suboxone saved my life.  I was looking for a good heroin connect when I went in and if I would have found it I would for sure be dead right now!!!!

I got out of Rehab toward the end of 04.  Completed the program with flying colors.  To this day I still go back and visit and give motivational talks to the current group of people there!  I never got off the suboxone though.  I still take .25mg daily.  I have tried to stop numerous times over the years but it is a bitch as yall know.  Even on that low of a dose!!!!!!

Point of all this is... KEEP LOOKING UP.  I 2 thought my life was done.  Now I have a beautiful wife, beautiful daughter, 3 bed 2 bath brick home I own, nice cars, nice job making good money.  That life is literally a thing of the past for me.  

I never want to forget though.  That is why I browse this sub reddit so much.  There really is a life after addiction people.  

Please reach out 2 me if you want help.  I have resources and can most likely help you even if it is just an ear.  I have been there and lived this life... 

Lastly.... If you want an update on my running crew back then.  I was the only one to get out of the ""game"".  My old vietnam dealer ended up getting a bullet to the forehead for screwing over someone.  Dood that taught me how to shoot is currently in prison for murder (his fiance... beat her over the head with empty whiskey bottle coming down from meth).  The other 4 people in my crew... 1 is dead (od), 2 in prison (fed not state) (drug charges), and the last one has spent the last 10 years in and out of jail, on/off probation etc.  Currently he is off and partying it up in Wisconsin with a new group of friends that seem in their early 20's.... All I can think of is what he is going to do to them... Will be interesting to watch his facebook feed over the next few months.

Well cops and paramedics came and the actor is alright (still in the hospital with a spinal infection go figure) anyway I pulled a pack of cigs out to go smoke and some fentanyl beans fell from my pocket GREAT! Anyway I go to jail and they asked me to write a statement blah blah I refused and called my lawyer. God bless my lawyer. This bitch is worth all the money I give her. She makes some calls gets me released 45 minutes after I got there. Cops want to stick me with possession of dangerous drugs and some general bullshit but after talking to her she said don't even sweat it they didn't find them on you i'll get this thrown out. She deserves the $500 per hour this will cost. On the bright side the cops did give me white castle while I was waiting and that hit the spot. And yes, IMMEDIATELY after leaving the police station I got high and edited the porno. I hope I dont sound arrogant or rude but for years and years of growing up poor being a dirty junkie and having nothing it feels nice to just laugh and tell the cops "" I want my lawyer"". 
On a side note I was respectful to the cops didn't cause them stress and they were nice when I asked for my lawyer. ",1500389271.0

He was only 18 when he passed away. He loved getting fucked up on all sorts of drugs, and experimented with all the RCs he could possibly get hands on. He was into psychedelics, especially. We'd joke about how he would die of doing bromo-dragonfly with MAOI for funzies or doing a thumbprint of acid but with his dickhead. But he didn't die of drugs, he died from trying to put off a big fire that spread halfway through his house from the kitchen, leading him to choke on smoke.

Ive had a lot on my mind the past 41 days, alot of positive and some anxious, and today final thought is, 'it makes sense'. It makes sense to live my life sober, at least that's how I'm feeling right now. I'm happy to be in recovery and I'm happy to have found a new way of life.

A little background:
Starting shooting up on dillys because someone that I knew was picking up scripts of them left and right (i was using oxys prior to shooting up, but eventually shot them once I learned how to IV). Once the dilly script fell through I continued IVing oxys, and I was also getting high off subs on days that I didn't have anything (orally/strips). Eventually i realized how much money I was spending per oxy, called an old friend, got a number, and switched to dope. 

I hear a lot of people at meetings talk about how they were 'left with no choice"" which is why they surrendered to the NA program. I personally didn't feel that way once I surrendered. 

What hapenned:
One random evening high as fuck I was texting my mom about going shopping the next morning. Long story short I had missed over 30 calls, not realizing that my phone had been on silent. She calls my girlfriend, my girlfriend spills EVERYTHING. She ambushes my apartment and see's me, looking rancid as fuck, strung out etc etc.

A month goes by, she tries to get me arrested, get the cops called on me, all of which failed, she tried to get me to go to Florida for 30 days, I said no...and I just kept on using until one day, randomly, she texts me to go see an outpatient coordinator in the area, so I say yes.

I get high that morning on whatever's left in my spoon, get into the car, go see the outpatient coordinator, we talk about vivitrol, then establish a plan to get on vivitrol. The plan was to see her every day until the day of the shot. 

Day 2, some dude is there, he's pinned out, my guess was he was fucked up, but apparently he wasn't and he had a good amount of days clean. Whatever the case may have been, I felt the urge to use that day. I'm pretty sure I knew it was gonna be my last time, but nevertheless I somehow ended up on my own, with my car, with a credit card to take out one last gift card. i scored 250 bucks on the card, and my dude hooked it up as usual. I spend that afternoon with some friends at my apartment, traded some of it for some blasts as I usually do, smoked some Js, and later that night flushed the rest down the toilet with my girl and called it a night.

NA for me is a new way of life. It's a way for me to feel something different, not have to worry about the hustle and bustle, a way for me to realize that I still have that superior strength and confidence that I had when I was high. I'm not working the steps super hard, but I do have a sponsor, I do have the basic text, and I do plan on working the steps eventually.

And yes, there have been some amazing amazing things that have happened since i got clean. That's not bullshit. Your life WILL change. I wont say 'get better' because getting high for me used to be what I was consider 'getting better' as far as my day and daily routine was concerned.

I still have moments, specifically when I'm by myself, where I get too into my head, and I'll randomly drive around, in a bad neighborhood, just seeing if I can spot anyone or anything or any activity that I could potentially get myself in to. A time or two Ive had coke cravings because vivitrol aint got shit to do with coke, but I never follow through. I take my ass to 711 and grab a red bull.

Life is GOOD. Life is different. Life is honest. Life is life.

Then found myself drawn here.","I've been lurking for a few weeks now. Before I even thought to visit this subreddit, I began having some pretty intense dope dreams. 

I had a fully-blown intravenous heroin habit which I indulged with my junkie ex. After two years, I finally dumped his ass and moved back home. I started off by weaning on suboxone and then just dabbling here and there.. Eventually, I cleaned myself up on my own with no support. It's been three years, and while I still smoke weed and occasionally drink, I've made dramatic changes in my life. I'm 26, I have a great job doing something I've found sincere passion in, I'm making money and I have savings. Admittedly, my home life has been uncomfortable recently, and my job is physically strenuous.. The emotional and physical pain undoubtedly contribute to these resurfacing feelings of the old addict within..

The dreams are unbearable. I'm perpetually finding or being given bags of dope. The dreams are so detailed; I can see the stamps on the pale-blue wax bags. I can even hold them up to the light and admire the pressed white powder.. I can swirl the cotton in the spoon, draw up the dirty brown liquid, push the needle into my vein.. And yet.. Nothing. I feel nothing. No wave of bliss falling over my chest, no sleepy nodding, nor heavy eyelids.. Thank fuck I don't have connections anymore. And yet at the same time, fuck I wish I still had them.

6nup2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6nup2i/successfully_made_it_through_tsa/,32,https://redd.it/6nup2i,ItchyNostrils,Successfully made it through TSA...,"I successfully made it through TSA security a total of 3 times this weekend at two different, large International Airports (one being a major hub on the West Coast). On my way out of town, I had to go through security twice. I initially made it through security with no issue and got to the gate only to find out that the flight was transferred to another gate in another terminal. This unfortunate change of gates forced me to go back through security a second time because the terminal that the flight was transferred to wasn't connected to the terminal that the flight was originally supposed to depart from.

The first time through the scanner, nothing came up and I was allowed to go on my way without hassle. When I got to security in the second terminal, I expected the same result only to have the TSA agent tell me that the scanner flagged ""my groin area as well as my buttocks"". She asked if I had anything in my pockets and, sure enough, I forgot to take a fucking pen out of my pocket that I was carrying. I figured once I showed her that I had a pen in my pocket I'd be good to go but she had me step aside for a pat down. I started getting a bit nervous but talked myself into keeping calm. Acting nervous does nothing but make them more suspicious so I did my best to remain friendly and calm. 

Because the scanner targeted my ""groin and buttocks area"", the agent doing the pat down primarily concentrated on my lower half and didn't even touch me above the belt. He did his thing, checking my waist band, patting my backside with the backs of his hands, and then using both of his hands (palms facing in) checked each leg starting about halfway up my thigh down to each ankle. The pat down only took a minute, if not less, and then I was let on my way. 

Coming home, I went through security once and the scanner found nothing so I was cleared to go on my way. Easy peasy. I did have stuff with me but it wasn't nearly as much since I did most of what I had during the trip. 

Now for the details I'm sure you guys are more interested in: Leaving town, I had 4gs of black (divvied up into half gram sacks for easy dosing because I didn't want to take my scale) and 2gs of white. I stuffed the 8 half-gram sacks of black as well as my one sack of white into a thin plastic tube that was about 3""-3.5"" long. Before arriving at the airport, I put the tube between my ass cheeks. 

I've traveled with dope a few times in the past and always put my sacks between my ass. The common misconception is that you need to stick the goods inside your rectum and this isn't true. You can simply squat down and put the sack between your cheeks, up against the outside of your butt hole. Once you stand up, the pressure of your cheeks squeezing together is enough to keep your goods where they're at. The reason I put my dope into a plastic tube is because the warmth and pressure can cause tar to get gooey and seep out of whatever you package it in while it's in your ass, I learned that the hard way. It's always a good idea to package whatever it is you're taking very well.

The important thing to remember is that these body scanners cannot penetrate skin and see things inside of you. They're designed to see things hidden under your clothes, ON your body. They're not strong enough to see things hidden inside of you (or hidden under/between enough skin). Even if the machine does happen to somehow catch something, the pat downs they do aren't anywhere close to invasive enough to discover things hidden between your ass. Most of the pat down, especially on the ""sensitive areas"", is conducted with the agent using the backside of their hands so they can't squeeze and feel around for stuff. You'd have to have something really bulky and obvious for them to discover it.

I know some people recommend putting powder dope into supplement capsules and placing them in your luggage and I'm sure that works as well. Tar is a bit harder to conceal that way, though, because of its consistency. Also, I don't like giving them a chance to see something I didn't intend on the x-ray baggage machine because if they see something even slightly suspicious, they're allowed to open your bag and search through your stuff. In my opinion, if you have to travel with drugs, putting it in your prison pouch is definitely the way to go. This marks the 4th or 5th successful trip I've had while traveling with my DOC.",1500313557.0

The cocaine sub seems to be mostly insufflation friendly, so I thought I would post this here, where plenty of people are familiar with smoking or shooting hard drugs...

So, anyone that has shot coke or smoked freebase/crack knows that the rush and high compared to snorting is far different, almost like experiencing a completely different drug.

I love the rush, I love the audio (tinnitus) effect. If I do coke, I want that bellringer that feels 10X stronger than an orgasm and makes music sound like I'm hearing it through molten headphones...

My question here is if anyone knows if that effect can be achieved by any other ROA other than smoked or injected. I understand how cocaine works, it is metabolized very quickly by the body. So to reach those peak levels, smoking or injecting is the best way to get a large enough amount into the bloodsteam in the short time period required for those effects.

I want to know if anyone here has ever experienced such a rush from snorting. Like if I had grade AAA 99% pure cocaine and snorted some big old fat lines quick enough, could I get the same effect? Has anyone ever done this and experienced a bellringer from snorting?

Also orally or plugged is an option in my question. I know due to vasoconstriction and other factors it is not absorbed well orally, and I don't know anything about whether or not it can be successfully plugged. I'm guessing if you took enough orally, you could reach those bellringer type effects. Downside would be the danger. It would be slow to come up, and longer lasting, so it could be that you take enough to feel the bellringer, but in doing so you have to take such a large dose that it would be very dangerous.

So I just want to know if anyone has ever experienced a bellringer from any other ROA besides IV or smoked.... 
I like the thought of a different ROA giving a more gradual and longer lasting bellringer but don't know if it's actually possible or in any way safe... ",1500308099.0

Its UsamaBinNoddin coming at you 6 months mostly sober. I haven't touched heroin since February or March. Not too clear on the exact date. I had several slipups with Crystal. As long as I'm not around it or have access to it, I can stay away, but if I find it or someone has it, I almost always take it without a second thought.

Anyways, some of you might remember me as the dude who ended up dating his dope girl who was in prison, then she got out and relapsed within 3 days, not that I didn't play a part in that and that I didn't share any blame for being a bad influence, because I did. But I have come to not blaming myself entirely, realizing that she was mostly at fault, but realizing the part that I played.

I am doing fairly well, my life isn't completely together, but I am a lot more together than I was 6 months ago. Now the deal is, she wrote me a couple of months ago. The whole ""I am so sorry for what happened... I was a raging junky bitch... I fucked up... I was reacting to the fact that you lied to me about having been clean... I'm sorry... I just want you in my life... Even if I blew the one shot with you.... No matter what I want you in my life... You are the most amazing person I have ever met... I am sorry... I'll understand if you want nothing to do with me"" letter.

Now I reacted to it by replying that things were fucked up, that I accept her apology but that she is going to have to prove herself when she gets out, that I'm not going to write her all the time or accept her calls, that she can try calling that I'll eventually answer but it might not be for a while. 

She tried calling for a couple of weeks, I didn't feel like talking yet, never received a letter back. She isn't my focus right now, I'm focusing on getting my life back together. I wrote her a letter a couple of days ago, 3 months later. 

She gets out next month. I don't want to repeat what happened last time. Im really conflicted on what to do here. A small part of me is angry and wants nothing to do with her. Another wants to give her Another chance, because I know what it's like to not be able to stay clean. I just... Idk. 

Whatever happens happens, but it's not a focus of mine. I've been a hermit for the last 4 months basically. Gained 20 lbs. Been hitting the gym lately and going on bike rides.

Anyways, I take oxy/percs fairly regularly as it is. It's becoming sort of a bitch to get them (and expensive.) Assuming I sort of keep my usage where it's at frequency wise, is switching to H intrinsically worse//more addictive? Or is it just that simply having a connect for H makes you more likely to go deeper down the rabbit hole?

From basic googling it seems as if oxy and heroin are very similar. The only real change I would be making is with the ROA, from popping pills to snorting H.

I just can't really get a good grasp on if whether H is the enemy it's made out to be, or if it's basically as dangerous as Oxy (but it's easier to slip up with heroin for the obvious reasons?)

I hope I worded my question adequately. But essentially could I switch to H for the logistical ease and not notice any big differences?",1500477969.0

Now i have no experience with fent but spending a lot of time on r/op It breaks my heart to see all the lives torn apart by scumbag dealers cutting with fent & knowing full well that they're committing murder. Anyways so i was browsing the fent sub and came upon this post 

https://www.reddit.com/r/fentanyl/comments/6m1hpc/maf_fentanyl_anyone_tried_this_chemical_and_if_so/

Now it's incredibly obvious that this guy is importing fent since he doesn't use himself. So when you put 2 and 2 together it's pretty obvious this guy is one of the people importing fent to cut and sell with so basically he is killing out friends, our family and our fellow addicts and very well you if you're buying heroin at street level. So my question is, does a post like this being so accepted on that sub and it's members basically helping this guy with reviews not concern anyone? How is this acceptable? If this guy is doing what i think he is he's basically a mass murderer, how do we stand up and fight this? Am i missing something and being a fkn idiot or is this shit as obv as it looks to me?

First off, about me: 22 years old, 120 pounds, 5'8. Prior to about 2 weeks ago, I was on 12~ continuous days of Clonazolam usage, 0.5mg a day, to help me with Adderall comedown which I have been taking since I was 10 years old. I took myself off of Clonazolam because I decided it was time for me to take a break because I didn't want to dig my grave too deep. About 4 days later, I was crashing on Adderall and I really wanted something to help me deal with this comedown, so I took a percocet 10mg with zero tolerance, I nodded off and when I woke up I was in the ER and the doctor was telling me I had a seizure and my roommate called 911. My question is, what's the likely hood of me experiencing the seizure from Clonazolam withdraw(which I'm not too sure if I was experiencing, I mean I still craved it but I wasn't in any horrible pain or anything like people express when going through Benzo withdraw) instead of the Percocet giving me a seizure? I'm not too sure what caused it.. My mom says it runs in my family and my dad had seizures all the time and that was what it was. I don't think that's why, I think it has something to do with either Clonazolam or Percocet with zero tolerance. Not sure which one tho..",1500450919.0

And 7 days until dope.,"Ok ok, fine, i cheated with klonopin, gaba, and booze. But heroin's out my system although in my head, dope is all i think about.

But with that 14 days, it occurred to me that I have a massive amount of money that I didn't use for heroin for JUST 14 days. Just for 14 days, I have accumulated money that I didn't know I could possess all at once.

I treated myself with buying clothes I've been wanting to buy. Real restaurant meals. And TIME to spend on seeing people, skateboarding, aggressive inline skating, learning boxing, and *most importantly*, finding MOTIVATION in life to do THINGS with or without dope.

I don't regret a single bit of all the dope shots I've done, even the OD, fall-outs, the rip-offs. It's all experiences, memories, and the learning foundation. But I now know... I can do all of those works and fun and activities while on dope, too, not just sit around listening to calming music.

Withdrawing was hell, but 2 weeks past, I'm trying to make myself as busy as possible to distract myself from boredom and void.

Dope was my escape. When I started abusing trams with my at-that-time best buddy, school was fuck all. It was a month before finals that I really started getting into it. Once I found my escape, there was nowhere else I wanted to go to. Me and my buddy had caves in our dorms. Warm blankets on warm blankets.

She's now sober. I love her to death, but I try not to talk to her often because I'm a professional bad influence. All I would talk about is how I did this shot and how I had to wait 8 hours for fent ridden crap... so on and so on. She talks about her cravings a lot, and I don't think my stories would help.

I'm on tolerance break, technically, not trying to get sober for good. When I'm old as shit, I'll be doing dope nbd like oh where's my vein fuck i'm old AND a junkie there are no veins i'm just gunna take my oxys and dillies cause i can get that prescribed when i'm old as shit, and IM the shit out of dope. Whatever. I don't ever plan on quitting dope forever. I don't see sobriety/substance usage black and white, I just see it that it's situational when you are better off with or without dope.

Anyways. I'm going to cambodia in a week, so that will be the third week of my tolerance break. The end of it.

I still get goosebumps and chills and depression is HARD. I already have bipolar I so my temper gets really bad yesterday I punched three holes on my wall, permanent marker'd all over the walls and shit. Now I gotta clean up that mess.

Peace yo, happy nods, and don't think you can't do anything else than dope! You are more capable than you think. When things get bad, you'll HAVE to see things in black and white. But it isn't.

You know Mr Roger's Neighborhood? It's like Bob Ross type of a calming children's show from a little while back. Well, he won a lifetime achievement award at the Emmy's and some other stuff, and his speech, I remember stuck with me for a long long time.

Here's (roughly) how it goes:

> Some are here, some are far away. All of us have special ones who have loved us and to be. Would you just take along with me ten seconds to think of the people who have helped you become who you are? Those who have cared about you, and wanted what was best for you in life. 10 seconds. I'll watch the time... whomever you've been thinking about--wherever they are, either here or in heaven--imagine how pleased they must be to know the difference you've they made to you, and how pleased those people must be to know that you thought about them right now.

And speaking of Bob Ross... if you feel dark right now, here's a [video for you to watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugJfjmxOR2I). It's only 40 seconds long.

so i go to meet him today and on the way i asked him if i could maybe give him the money on thursday. he's like ""yea, no problem."" bing bang boom, we meet and i go home. calls me about 45 min later and tells me he wants to know how much he appreciates me, and that this time **is on him**. now, this wasn't 1-2 buns. this was **$350**. i didn't know what to say, except ""are you sure?!"" he was like ""yea, you know i'm having a kid soon and i just don't know when i'll be able to do something like this for you at this level again, so i wanted to do it while i could."" i still can't believe it.

sorry for the shitpost. when i started using dope, it wasn't like it is today. people appreciated your business, not shit all over you every time they could. it's just so rare these days to find a dude who appreciates the business and loyalty... and if anything, i'm fucking loyal. i've blown tens of thousands of dollars with these other punk assholes, only to have them refuse to let me hold a half a bun for a few hours. anyway, that's my story (and i'm stickin' to it!) hope you're all having a wonderful (and safe!) night!

I have a childhood friend who was always the sweetest person, with a kind heart and beautiful soul. Once we got a little older, we were both a little wild; drinking together at 12 and 13, smoking weed together the following year...but once she got into meth, she completely spiraled out of control. Stealing money and guns from her mom to pawn, getting pulled over while shooting up and driving and then asking the cop to at least squirt the heroin (she shot h as well as meth).
 
Anyway, this post isn't really about her. It's about me!! Haha, just kidding (but not really, this is about me.) My boyfriend has been dabbling with using meth on occasion in the last few years. Nothing serious at all, no spun out craziness of taking out a pay day loan to buy a score. Just once every few months. I was always adamantly against it, which is kind of hypocritical seeing as I [we] was a heroin addict for about a year (story for a different time) and said I'd never do it as I've seen first hand how it ruins people's lives and I just think it's gross.

But tonight, we were talking about what it was like to have sex on different drugs and I started questioning him about what sex on meth was like. Since we've been dating for 6 1/2 years and he first tried meth 3 years ago, the only person he's had sex with while high on it, and since I disapproved, he didn't tell me he was high. So then he asked me if I'd want to ever try sex on meth. I asked if he had it, and here we are, high on meth for the first time about to have sex.

The main adjective I'd use to describe how I'm feeling right now is content. It's not what I would have imagined I'd feel. But I also feel the speedy part. Like, typing this out feels good; I now understand why the Nazi's gave it to their workers and soldiers.
 When it first set in, I felt a great closeness to my boyfriend. I took off my shirt and had him take his off and just admired him and drew a Pisces symbol on his shoulder where I'm going to it someday. 

 I think this sex is about to be amazing. Maybe if you ask nicely, I'll give you a post-coitus brief. ;)

anyway, I've decided to kick because it's just too expensive of a habit to maintain and I spend way too much time middling for people and shit just to support this snowball of an addiction.

I bought two strips of 8mg Suboxone. Initially, I was thinking I'd take half a strip when I feel shitty, and then every 24 hours after that for 3 more days. But, my friend who's a long-term heroin abuser says it'd be better to take a full one the first day, and then two half doses, which would essentially last me three days (instead of four).

What's your opinion? How should I space these subs out? I'd prefer not to feel any withdrawal effects, obviously lol. I don't care about getting high on the subs.

Though A few years ago I could just take 1 and be fine, but after a few years of recreational/ abusive use I now have to take 3 to feel it. I know that I need to taper down, but I don't know how. 
My new doc does random pill counts and it's REALLY URGENT 

Basically all I need to know is:

1. Can I taper down to 1 at a time by just tapering down my use? (Like going from 3 to 2 1/2 to 2 etc.?

2. If so how long between each taper down should I wait?

3. Or would I need to just stop completely for a tolerance break?

4. If so how long should I have to take a tolerance break for?

Any comments/ suggestions welcome! 
Thanks in advanced xxxx ",1500417573.0

I had been on an extremely powerful euphoric painkiller know as Fentanyl for three months straight at this point. What a Christmas I had, nodding all over the milk and cookies. As I sat on the toilet either shitting my bowels out or pumping out some hemorrhoids due to constipation (so back in forth I can’t recall which in particular it was), I decide penultimately, that times are gonna be a-changing. I can’t live this way. My supply is limited. This gift basket I found in the streets isn’t gonna hold me for long. 

[This basket of drugs is akin to “the suitcase” from Pulp Fiction. Get used to not knowing about it. Happy to hear your theories.]

As I stare through blurry eyes at my ever-reddening foot, I finally feel the warmth from the already used patch of fentanyl flowing through me. It’s kinda like heroin if heroin were in the middle of a snowstorm. The fentanyl buzz is cold, grey and devoid of that blankety feeling of the morphine family. However, that bitch packs quite the punch. I began nodding off on the toilet, a la Elvis Presley, as I went into a daydream. I saw myself up on a stage with the floodlights all beaming up on me like the sunshine for my soul. I had no doubt just done a shot of heroin in backstage before coming outside and plucking away on my Sigma acoustic guitar, playing some old worn out love songs which never leave my soul. In this dream inside a dream, I begin to ponder past loves, mainly my first. A beautiful blonde girl from the mountains with a heart as golden as her locks. This girl was my best friend. If only I could have been more of a man (and not a girl pants-wearing emo faggot), I think I would have had her. If I would have had her, I never would be in this position. There’s no way! Someone that smart, pretty and intelligent and loyal would never allow my character to be diminished by my silly, self-destructive alternate personality. Suddenly I come to, as the dream “me” kicks out the lights and the crowd abruptly stops. 

“Hey b, you done in there?”, my mother calls out to me in the sweetest of tone, ""I need to empty the laundry basket"". I come to, slurring “yes mom, be out in just a second"". I quickly wipe my ass even though there’s nothing on the paper. I had forgotten the entire reason I was in here was just to sit my foot on that heater. [the heat from the space heater on my skin / the transdermal patch causes the speed of delivery to increase greatly.] I do a double take at the door, making sure she isn’t looking inside for some odd reason. Then I carefully unplug and pack up the heater back into the closet. What excuse do I have for that? “I’m too cold to take a shit?” I wash up under the dual sinks in my plush middle class home, wiping my hands on the purple (everything is purple here) hand towel above. “Damn, did you fall in?”, my father jokes. I quickly retort with a lie. “No I've just been eating a lot of cheese lately, you know how that goes...” “Oh God”, my father says disgusted. He knows I have IBS-constipation. He just doesn’t know exactly why it has gotten a lot worse in the past few months. [You know, this is a recurring side effect in my use which has got to be the worst hell I can imagine in this life.]

Anyway, little did I know it, but today would mark the day of my last taste of this sweet and sour chemical I had grown so bitterly fond of. The plans were set in motion for a friend, C, and I to go a mutual friend, J’s house. Now J was a newly christened weedhead. C and I were veterans who had recently introduced him, and he was kind enough to invite us back to get high on his dime. This was during a period in all of our lives where we were all in the early college days and preferred to not remember much of each of those days. Not for any reason in particular, only for the sheer fun we had. Putting on beats, hitting bongs, drinking a couple Bud Lights and freestyling. Then we would be calling some girls over (J was a lady’s man with his family’s money and his high metabolism six pack abs). Sometimes we'd end the night getting jerked off while hitting a blunt. Ah, ""this is the life"", we thought. Well, that was last time I was there... This time I’m showing up (without anyone's knowledge) as a junky. It’s crazy what a matter of mere months can do to change a person when putting on the narcotic brakes every day until ending up with the body of an elderly person who needs prunes every day just to drop the Browns off at the pool. Not even miss Mary Elizabeth Winstead herself could get me to bust a nut right now on this amount of fentanyl. 

C and I began packing our stuff up out of my room in my parents house where we all have been staying as of late (I had a few different goons living over during this time period). We made damn sure to get the bong from out the closet, definitely gonna be needing that. I make sure to slide back into my room after we leave because I forgot something. Take a guess what. I go up under my audio receiver and slide the remaining three used fentanyl patches into my bag. (Wait… had I forgotten the two I’m already wearing on my foot..? It would seem so). Since I am what I am, I go ahead and slice up one patch, putting each half on each side of my mouth, buccally. Usually I would leave them there for a bit and see how they do. If I'm not satisfied, and never am, I would chew on them quite a bit to really get the juices flowing. This day I was chewing like this pain patch was fucking double bubble. I gotta be sociable tonight! I slide another cut piece or two into my pocket for later use. Goodness knows I’m not gonna go this entire, dreary car ride without another piece!

Now, for the sake of harm reduction I would like to say my friend was driving. However it was my car. He knew I was fucked up, just didn’t know how or why. I vaguely recall me driving to the end of my parent’s road, just out of sight and switching spots with C. He told me to pack a bowl for the road, so of course I obliged. His weed after all. We cruise on out of our rural “village” as we call it, past the whole three red lights, past the banks, funeral homes and fast food/gas stations which are all that make up this town anymore. We pass the two cops that are on duty in the entire town, sitting at the Hardees parking lot (probably gossiping). I discreetly slide the bong down out of sight, and that’s really all there is to it around here. Sure, you get unlucky, but for the most part in our town, cops are lazy and just don’t get a fuck. Props, I guess..?

We finally hit the on ramp to the interstate, turning right directly past the Arby’s, and we’re gliding now. My little Honda Accord is trucking along, zipping past the semi-trucks. I trust C’s driving skills more than I trust my own. The kid has played so many damn video games his reaction skills must be at peak performance, even with the herb in his system. That shit ain’t slowing us down anyway. Just another thing we do to feel “normal”. We float on past the “Northern drivers” as we call them, mostly older people going on some kind of retirement trip, I imagine. Ahh, what normalcy must feel like. Keep in mind these people do about 60mph in the fast lane [no offense to all my northern friends. Love yall <3]. C pays no mind, he is inside of Crazy Taxi right now, and I’m inside my own narcotic dream, slowly turning nightmare. I take one last gaze out up the mountains where I grew up, right below us as we climb above, higher and higher on this interstate. For a brief moment, I envision what my life would have been like had I never touched that first pill. My daydream is soon interrupted by a phone call from J. I answer. 

“Hey bro, where you guys at? Have you passed the first exit yet? Okay, no? So get off there first and I’m gonna let you meet my new girl”. We hang up. Well, this is an interesting twist. I motion for C to get off at the next exit, a small stop with only a couple truckstops, gas stations and maybe one restaurant. J was at this Mexican restaurant after a dinner with his bae, so we pull in there. Out of the corner of my eye, I see this girl of his in the back corner of this parking lot next to J’s Camaro, and I immediately felt all my past loves were reincarnated inside of her. 

Enter Katy… another dazzling blonde bombshell from the mountains (does it seem I have a type here?) with blue eyes like diamonds. She was wearing a tight, white wifebeater which fit snugly on her model body. It was obvious this girl does squats, among other things. She wore a cross necklace, a devout Christian as most “good girls” are around here. She wore Daisy Duke short shorts and a pair of sandals which would only be fitting to wear to church. After snapping myself out of a trance, I finally tell C “let’s go” as we both step out of the Honda. We crawl over to where J is standing beside his super sleek orange sports car. Before we are even halfway over to him, he yells out “hey dudes, this is Katy. She wants to smoke!” We get there, and I’m pretty sure C and I both said simultaneously, “uhh… sure.” We were both likely at a loss for words, in awe of the sheer beauty in front of us. In that moment, I thought, I could see the pain in this girl’s eyes. Something I recognized that no one else could, just maybe for a moment, she saw mine too… 

[I used her name because if she somehow ever reads this, I want her to know how sorry I am. I’m so sorry I strained your relationship. I’m so sorry I scared the life out of you on a night which was supposed to be all fun and games. I’m sorry for everything.]

We sat around on the curb for a bit as J and Katy leaned against the Camaro, shooting the shit with them. Just basic getting to know one another small talk, so that hopefully her anxieties about smoking diminish. She had never had a bong, or good weed, but she had once upon a time hit some ditch weed out of a joint. That’s nothing, baby, we got medical. C and I were infamous in the tight-knit crew we ran with for being serious fucking stoners (simultaneously being the worst stoners ever, always forgetting a lighter, pipe, papers, or something). We were the only ones we knew of in our area with even a dank connect there for a while. No one would believe us when we tried to tell them it’s 20/gram, until they got a taste. Anyway, I’m sure we talked some about all this to them, how we got the best shit mailed straight from Cali, blah blah. We then parted ways as J says “just follow me once we get off the next exit, so I can show you where I live now”. 

We cruise behind J as we get onto the on ramp, cross some more mountains, a couple more exits to some boondocks-type places, until finally here we are at our exit. We turn right, then go through a couple red lights (much bigger stops than our town has), and eventually make a blind right turn into what seems like a drop off, where it is so dark and my vision is so blurry. C whips it in there with no issues of course, and before we know it we are at J’s house. It’s a modest little cottage type home, with a 90 degree drop for a driveway, and J’s older jeep (which he mainly drives; he’s modest for a rich guy) sits in that driveway. We all hop out quickly, anxious to get that first fat bong rip. In the midst of the excitement, I had forgotten my bag in the car which contains most of my illegal stuff. I must have gotten all the fent patches out of it when we stopped earlier. I was seriously eating the things like candy. Who needs sour patch kids when you can just chew on straight drugs?

Being the gentleman that he is, J unlocks the door on his little cottage home, allowing katy, C and myself to walk in first. Immediately we are greeted by his little dog, I don’t care to remember the breed. I’m a “big, outside dog” type of guy. I normally would be thinking, “great, i’m gonna have a field day with allergies on this stay.” However, I was too high to care, about anything. J immediately offers us a beer, and not to be rude we both take one gladly. I don’t remember much from this point on. Surprising, huh?

I just remember after getting settled, we all end up gathered in J’s “smoking room”. He is the type of dude to go all out for everything he does. So he has neon lights, a speaker/laptop setup for youtube, a futon to sit on, and a few chairs. So of course C and I are sitting in the floor, as I pull out the bong from C’s backpack and see their eyes light up. I pass it to C, he passes it to them to inspect, while I’m rolling a joint (just for chill’s sake), and he is grinding up even more for a bowl. I remember how easily rolling this joint came to me while I was fucked up beyond belief. Usually my nerves would prevent me from rolling to perfection, but not tonight.  As the reefer smoke helps illuminate the neon room, I can’t help but get an overwhelming urge to nod off into oblivion. I think they noticed that, but it didn’t stop us from having a few in depth conversations about the universe, life, and Snickers bars. The last story I remember was told by Katy. She told of the time her little sister was taken away from her all to soon, in a tragic fourwheeling accident. I had heard of this all over the news, but didn’t realize she was part of that family. She didn’t cry, only appeared numb to it all now. “There it is”, I thought. “that pain I saw...” Everything made sense now, as I take a final sip from my brew and a final drag on the joint. 

I now realize that J and Katy had actually retired to their room long ago at this point. C looked down at me from atop the futon. “Dude, what the fuck are you on?”, he finally asks firmly. “Ah, nothing man, I’m just so tired. That weed be hittin’, yo”, I replied, completely full of shit. After shaking his head and asking if I need anything, he tells me to get up on the futon at least so I can sleep. I ask him to put Family Guy on a loop. He found some sketchy streaming site to do so (didn’t have all my private torrent sites like back home). I dragged my drugged, useless body up there. I truly don’t think I was ever one-hundred percent on this futon by the way. When I passed out, the last thing I remember was “shut up, Meg” as my lower torso was determined to slink its way off of the furniture for some reason. I want to think in those last few moments of lucidity, I thought about my mother (how good she had been to me), and my first love (how good I had been to her), and all my friends and good times in between. I wanted to think I begged for God to save me... I didn’t. In fact I wasn’t thinking anything, in retrospect. As my one open eye came to a final close, I saw the illuminated glow of the Griffin family house on the laptop in front of me for one last time…

So, my SO the other week, at dinner, casually drops that she knows I have another reddit account (I never *really* hid that fact), and she went through it (inb4 fucked up invasion of privacy. She had reasons that I accept, and don't have to explain). 

Naturally, I'm goddamned floored. She did NOT know about my chipping recently, about my on and off use. Y'all know why. Because I was certain that, no matter how often she says just tell her, she'd rather know, I was goddamned *positive* that to admit that would be to end the relationship. Who would stick around? Who would blame her for leaving? I sure wouldn't. 

Like the good junkie I am, I deflected, saying something about ""oh yeah, that's my porn account"", and praying I didn't actually see that hurt ?desperate?concerned? look in her eyes. She didn't pursue. 

Fast forward. Yeah, I was smack in the middle of another fuck up when this happened. It's done now, I've run out, and I'm thankful. I decided the LAST one before that, that I was done. But yanno. Fucked up and picked up one more time. You know how it is. Dope man even hooked me up fat. I'm tryna be good, only get a little, and he gives me double. 

It's done now. The last couple/few days have been shit. And I am done. Am I never ever going to take a pain pill when I don't need it? Imma try, but I'm a realist. I'm sure it'll happen on occasion. But I'm gonna hold it down to rarely as I can, and I'm not gonna seek to buy them or get them prescribed if I don't need em. Can't fuck up if I don't have them. 

And I'm not buying one more single fucking point of heroin. None. I'm done. That's actually the easy part. I had almost 20 years clean until the last couple. I won't beat myself up. I'm an addict, and shit happens. But I'm fucking done. The life I have now is worth more to me. The periodic withdrawals are fucking unbearable and completely avoidable. I'm fucking done. I'm really truly sincerely completely fucking done. I quit cigs 6 months ago, and I will slay this demon as well. I am done.

**And to my SO, if you're reading this at some point. I kind of hope you do.**

I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry. I'm so fucking sorry just for having fucked up, and so fucking sorry for the collateral damages it caused - you probably don't even know. 

But I'm also sorry for lying. For hiding. And I'm sorry I can't say this to your face. I'm sorry I had to deflect. I'm sorry I STILL can't say it to your face. Ask me, and I will tell you. Start the conversation, and I will talk. But I will never initiate that conversation. I will push on through, never mentioning these fresh scars, these fresh sins.

I do. Anyway, I'm starting to process I really shouldn't be smoking weed before bed because I'll wake up all groggy and unable to get up and go as quickly. I'm looking forward to getting paid to get my room mate off my back and be an employed slave just like him and then pay back the dboy brothers and prolly most definitely grab a few more bags.

Beer+ECP is great. I always used to avoid drinking and chipping bc that's how my cousin died about 2 years ago.. 

It's incredibly conflicting working at this gas station who has notorious history with junkies not only working there but chilling outside and panhandling and shooting up in our bathrooms.

I'm so jealous lol. 

Jk jk. But I did have an IV dream last night and when I get paid I'm really contemplating buy a box of rigs or at least a few to get up with til the next week. I don't want to be a cautious and calculative junkie again.

I, like, need to bang some chick and get some sober notions of living life to come up and present themselves or I'll just have moved cities for absolutely no reason and just to get hired again and fall into the same shit. 

This new city is 100% worse than my hometown and the dope isn't even as good lol [although my neighbors has been consistent and shard-like ECP powder]

Anyway, this is my shitpost and I'd hope for some reasoning and maybe an idea of what to fill my desires with.. Or tell me to boof it bc I'm easily persuaded and I've never tried it before lols ",1500399081.0

High, or at least not dope sick, I hope. So, here's my predicament:

Growing up, I was (in)fortunate enough to have a father that was prescribed 480 Roxy 30's a month. Yes you read that right, 480 a month, along with a litany of other drugs (klonopin, soma, methadone) and quickly started getting too fucked up to wake up for work. So, to fill the financial vacuum left when he lost his job, my mother and I took him from 16 Roxies a day to 12, and sold the remaining 4 a day, amounting to an extra 120 pills a month. I was 16, and before a year was out, I was addicted. I'm now 24 and have spent the last 8 years off and on opiates.

I finally tried heroin after the pills got too expensive, and finally graduated from snorting to shooting up at the very beginning of January 2016. Just after midnight of February 1st, just shy of a month since I started shooting up, my incredibly patient and understanding fiance and I found out we were going to be parents. I totaled my car (sober) two days later.  As soon as I found out about my impending fatherhood, I started making attempts to get clean. Finally got myself sober, but not before getting us evicted from our apartment back in Murfreesboro, TN and making my pregnant fiance homeless. She would get high with me on pills sometimes, but is by no means an addict herself, so she had no hand in the dire situation I put us in.

My family (only my father lived in TN at this point, my mother in San Diego, and my older brother had moved from Cali to Utah about a year prior for work. My brother is the only one in our family that has his shit together, but he had been keeping me at arms length after I failed to return a $200 loan to him six months prior to all this happening. When he heard he was going to be an uncle (he's gay, he can't have children naturally, and he wanted to be a part of my daughter's life) and that I was going to NA meetings, trying to stay sober, he offered to fly us to Utah to live with him and his fiance, only because he was proud of me for trying to better myself for my daughter. So he graciously intervened to give my little girl a stable environment to be born into. 

I have been very good for almost a year, but I am currently finding myself in the midst of a very light relapse. I started a new job about 4 months ago, and I make more money than I ever have in my life. Between the physical labor, the stress from living with my family (mother moved here too, she's literally crazy, and my brother is a narcissist who has violent anger issues), and the fact that I'm an addict, I finally met a reliable source and started buying black again. I'm not getting dope sick, and I'm not spending all my money on it. My daughter is well taken care of, and I do not use unless all her food, diapers, wipes, lotions, toys, etc are taken care of. I buy a gran every Thursday morning when I get paid, and use it for two or three days as a treat for myself. I know I'm a shit father/husband for it, but it really does feel nice to have my little habit once a week. 

My issue is this: my mom and I used pain pills together for about 5 years straight. She knows when I'm high. Here lately, my family has been catching on. They know I'm high because I'm in uncharacteristically good moods, my pupils get small, I talk A LOT, and I wind up throwing up from smoking too many cigarettes, and I don't sleep well when I'm on dope. Other than not talking as much, what are some ways I can either cover up my obvious buzz, or what are some okay excuses I can use to explain my odd behavior every Thursday/Friday? I have told them the reason I don't sleep is because I go grocery shopping in the morning (night shift) and that when I get paid I wait for my fiance to wake up to discuss budgets, and that I throw up because of the stress associated with financial shit. But they're still suspicious. My mom notices more than anyone. If I was just doing pain pills, she wouldn't care as long as I shared with her. So I can't be honest about doing anything, cause she'll expect me to break her off. And if she knew I was doing heroin, she'd lose her mind. She wouldn't tell my brother or brother-in-law though. If they find out I'm using anything at all, they'll kick me out. 

Please don't preach at me about having a child a d being irresponsible. The guilt already eats away at me. But fuck man, I give all my time and money to my family, I don't think a hundred bucks a week and a good weekend makes me a bad dad. As I said, I make sure before anything else that my daughter is okay. After that, it's just spending money. Any pointers guys?",1500559905.0

Some say its all a plan, but not I. 

Ever sat back and stared at a blade of grass?

Down on your luck, but does it care about your ass?


Does anybody care? Does anybody matter?

The answer is no, empirically and unironic as it be.

The real answers, to no ego do they play flatter. 

Your anguish is debauched, and unattached to what we see. 


Men better than you have died alone in misery and pain. 

Men better than you have fought long and hard, to what gain?

An eternity of nothing. Their anguish but a drop of grain. 


Women better than you have sat alone and cold. 

Women better than you sat waiting for the night to end, only to grow old.

The sad the mad the lonely, all willing to pay for a hope that no one sold. 


The martyr dies but one death, like all the rest. 

The savior fails to save himself, like all the rest. 

The heroic die only to be forgotten, like all the rest. 

Surely you will wallow alone and afraid, like all the rest.


And so the wheel moves ever forward, crushing those beneath.

Everybody dies sad and alone, regardless of your disbelief. 

Nobody wins, and nobody loses. All waiting for release. 

If we enter another life, one of pain surely is what I believe. 


Enjoy it while it lasts o' fragile one.

You have no idea when you'll be done. 

Only one thing is certain my friend. 

Every second gets us closer to the end. 


A meaningless march or a grand design? 

The question is meaningless, the answers lie across a fine line. 

None willing to cross, none able to admit their own lack of shine. 

Can we handle the fact that none of this is worth fighting for? 

Are we able to understand the futility of life, or...

Are we doomed by our own beliefs to the core? 


Doomed to continue marching on and on and on and on and on....

A couple of months ago, I was living in Scotland in an urban area with a history of heroin and benzo use. Of course, it's not history really, it's a lived reality for hundreds of people, and I often came across people who were nodding out on the side of the road and the like. 

My question refers specifically to this one time I was walking back from uni and there was a guy sitting on my stoop. He was blocking the door so I decided to chat for him a bit. I think he'd just taken something because within a few minutes of me getting there he started drifting away, losing focus, coming back, smiling softly, struggling to stand etc so I helped him sit down again and asked him how his day was going. Unfortunately he had a thick accent and was beginning to mumble so I couldn't understand what he was saying anymore but the general vibe was he'd broken up with his girlfriend at the bus station and didn't have anywhere to go. I stayed with him for like ten minutes until he seemed to come round a bit more. I'd just been at the shops so I offered him some food, and we stood outside my house eating sliced cheese together for a bit. After that I said ""So this is my house actually and it's time for me to head in, you're welcome to stay on the stoop if you like?"" 

He was really sweet and thanked me for the food and the chat but as I was walking up the steps to my apartment I thought there was maybe something more I could have done. I'll be brutally honest because I'm embarrassed about this: I was too scared to ask what I could do to help in case he asked me if I could let him crash or give him money, neither of which I wanted to do. I also didn't know if there was anything harm reductiony I should have known, considering he'd (to my limited knowledge) clearly just eaten some pills or injected something.

What do you think? I want to learn more so I can be as helpful as possible in the future to people. What do you (I.e 'one') need if you've just gotten high? Please let me know if I sound judgy. I'm worried that I do and if so, I want to change that. ",1500537970.0

I'm down to 1mg per day sublingual from about that same amount snorted) going to work for my aunt on an all nighter. We do all kinds of carpentry related work but for today we were just moving shit from her basement to her new, minimal style home up the road some miles next to my grandparents. It was a hot and humid day here in the mountains and I was sticky as some ghostly ectoplasm before I even started work. 



I could feel the 1mg of suboxone I slid under my tongue kicking in somewhere about the time I was already too miserable to even tell i was unsick (not totally, it doesn't work as well sublingually). I cheekily thought how i was wasting suboxone since the sun made me dopesick anyways (not literally but drenched in sweat and irritated is how my wd begins). Oh, did I mention I left work with my aunt to go pick green beans from my grandparents garden? Right in the fucking devilish rays of the sun. At this time on no sleep, and with no one to talk to I really felt Satan raging inside of me, trying to rise up to the surface. 

I go home and eat some of momma's chili dogs after visiting weedman for a dank gram. I get a message from my friend whose phone I was probably blowing up as usual (sorry), but before I know it my messages aren't sending back. To my horror all phone signal is out, no service or WiFi or even dial tone on the landline. It turns out some towers were down or something because literally every phone carrier in my area was RIP. I felt like Fred Fucking Flintstone on this bitch. I was bugging out because I had just wanted to talk to my friend all day due to the misery of the sun and sleep deprivation / slight WD from a quick taper. 

So of course I speed up to my grandparents to check their situation out. Alas, the blessed WiFi signal! Thank God. (Totally not addicted to internet).

Only now I come to find some of my old friends are up here visiting the pool with my sister. So of course they talk me into running home and getting my weed shit to let them get vaped. I drive home yet again, telling my mom ""i forgot my charger"" which wasnt a lie. Come to think of it i would have told her i was getting my weed if my other grandparents had not been there. 

Finally im back up and grammas with the girls. We catch up on each other's lives and it appears they are still just not doing shit with theirs as well. We vaped discreetly on the other side of the house as to not cause a scene where my grandpa (retired old marine vet) sees. 

I know these girls got high but one of them couldn't figure out how to hit the vape correctly (suck slow, like a milkshake I said). Therefore she kept saying how she wasn't even high. Psh okay. 

Anyway, after all this I somehow wind up passing the fuck out hard in my grandparents basement. I was awoken to darkness as my mother comes down the stairs. What is she doing here? Oh she wants her vehicle back. Right. What the fuck? It's 11pm now? I try to call my mom and can't because everyone's phone is ded. I'm having a slight panic attack now as I can't contact anyone, felt so fucking alone and just in the dark. In withdrawal hard as fuck now for some reason. It wasn't bad for long though. My aforementioned friend punctually replied back to my freak out text so at least I could contact someone. I had a scare with WiFi up here as well so I wasn't sure I could even do that. 

Basically after that, my cousin randomly shows up. He saved me from my overdose years ago by calling the ambulance in time. He is basically my brother and we seem to have a connection to each other which works like a sixth sense for when either of us are in danger. So it is fitting he would show. I got a shower, took my 1mg again (oops taper failed. Hasn't been 24 hrs yet). Vaped a bowl and here I am.

However I did get pain meds that were stolen from *a* grandma and I feel terrible about it. 

**Story**: I usually buy from this guy, he's decent and has pills every few weeks from, ""[his] very own scripts"" and usually hits me up with fair prices. He's desperate to sell the fast as well. 

Something that always seemed strange is they would often times have no idea what they were selling, Oxy 10's would be sold as 5's and vice versa. I chocked this up to just being a stupid drug dealer, you know? 

Today I went to the usual pick up place, the kid's Grandma's house where he is living. As I'm driving there he tells me to park in the garage becuase his, ""neighbor is a cop and will call the cops if he sees us"". My anxiety spikes. But *oxycodoneeeee*... so I decide to keep going.

I'm at the house. I'm parked in the driveway. He opens the garage door and I walk inside by the car. He bends down saying, ""Sorry they're in my grandma's car"". Grabs some medicine bottle out of the glove box and removes the label so I can't see. Then hands me the pills. The deal goes down right in fucking clear view of the neighbors house in broad daylight. Pretty obvious for anyone who's paying attention what's going on, but I don't care. *Hell yes! Fresh, oxy!*

I hand him money, and we go our separate ways. As I'm leaving, out comes this poor older woman from his house, she's fucking fuming. Furious. Gives me a disgusted look while talking on the phone (I can't hear what she's saying, but it ain't good), and instantly rushes into the garage to find the kid blankly staring at her. Looking like an opiated deer in headlights. 

I drive off, while the kid's staring at me and me the look of impending doom. My stomach is in knots. *The fuck just happened?*

**It hits me:** This kid isn't selling his scripts. He's selling his *GRANDMA's*. That's why he doesn't know what they are half the time. That's why he's always able getting scripts every other week when he's only 25. That's why he wanted me to go into the garage instead of in front of the house; it's not his neighbors he's worried about. It's his fucking grandma. 

So what the fuck do I do? I feel like SHIT. This lady needs her pain medicine and I'm just using it for fun. I've bought quite a few scripts off this guy. Godamn. Also, are the cops going to be looking me if they got a call from her? If she gave them my plate #? I'm surly never buying from this kid again, and telling others to stay way. 

**Lesson of the day:** Don't fucking pawn your Granny's happy pills for cash when she needs them for pain. Fuck man.",1500513340.0

i am almost 99.9% sure he has shit twisted. mainly because I have taken these before, between doses when i was still using (was broke & couldn't get well) and definitely felt PWD.

I have a friend that has done dope for 5 years or so... and never had a weird reaction. However, the past couple of months he has had mental episodes after doing his same normal dosage.

Now, I don't think it is something in the dope itself, because other people have done the same product without having the same reaction. (Well, not something in the dope that is inherently dangerous. Maybe it interacts with only him.)

So this is what happens:

* Within 5-10 minutes of him snorting a line of dope it starts. It will start slow he will start mumbling random words and noises. If you talk to him at this point he can at least respond. He will just say ""No, no, I am fine.""

* Then it starts for real. He will do all sorts of wild shit. He starts talking to people who aren't there, jumping on cars, going completely out of it. He gets a high temperature. He will strip down naked.

* Now keep in mind I know FOR A FACT he isn't doing other drugs on top of it either. That was our first thought but he was under supervision and it still happened. 

* It got so bad the last time the police were called and ended taking him to the hospital. They gave him narcan at first but it didn't do anything. Ended up giving him Ativan and inducing a coma. He was in a coma for 4 days and came out of it. During the coma he had a temp of 107 at one point...

* The episodes last for around four hours or so... with the first two being the worst and slowly stopping afterwards. 

Has anyone ever seen anything like before??? Some people have suggested it was cut with bath salts, spice, etc... but again other people have been doing doses the same size or higher and it doesn't effect them like this at all. 

On the other hand, he has done it without these issues happening in between times it did. It is usually a light colored dope that it happens. 

I have heard of mental illnesses being under the surface and they get triggered and brought to the surface with drug use. He has been doing dope for 5+ years though without any of this happening.

Has anyone heard of strange cuts doing this?(This happened in the WV/MD/VA)

Anyone making sourcing posts or comments is asking for a ban. Sourcing will get our subreddit shut down, so the mods take it very seriously. 

Here are the rules from the sidebar:

>No sourcing! Sourcing is any post regarding the acquisition of drugs, including legal substances, from a specific person or place, including other subreddit members. Posts about finding people in your city/state will be deleted and a ban may be issued. 

>No location-specific posts! FOR ANY REASON. This includes neighborhoods AND cities. 

>MEET-UPS ARE NOT ALLOWED for ANY reason! Any posts about meet-ups will be removed. We are not responsible for anything that happens outside of this subreddit.

If you see a sourcing post or comment, please either report it or page one of the mods: /u/traceyh415, /u/FashionablyFake, /u/travs3dpe, /u/spinderella69, or /u/chasing-d0pamine. 

Please give us a hand in making sure r/opiates does not get shut down. Thank you. ",1500488134.0

I checked this morning and it said that it was banned 6 hours ago. Does that mean all of its content is deleted forever? It's so weird seeing a subreddit that I went to be banned. I'm not even really sure what rules were broken. I just wanted to let everyone know if they haven't found out yet. ,1500485037.0

A puke post.,"So, last night I was prepping my shot of oxy. It was my second of the day, and I was sick. Right in the middle of my prep I puked. Luckily, I was in the bathroom.

Never happened to me before. I've puked before a shot, not in the middle of prepping one. Oh, and I had just eaten a lil bit of chocolate, so it looked like I puked up shit! Gross! ",1500482935.0

Because with every bag of dope I've ever bought containing some sort of fent analogue I figure this shit can't be that hard to find. I figure if I can find it for myself and get dosages perfect this could be a good change for me, as buying 15$ half points of fent dope isn't really worth it.",1500480512.0
