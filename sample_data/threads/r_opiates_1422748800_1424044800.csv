So first off let me say that I am an experienced opiate user and I am not just doing too much.

So here's the deal. I got some H a few days ago. The first day I snorted about 0.3 over about an hour and it made me vomit. After that I had a headache for a while, but I was very high. I chocked it up to a stronger batch or maybe something I ate didn't agree with it and moved on with my day.

Two days ago I did some more (probably about 0.3 again). After about 30 mins the same thing happened; I vomited very hard and generally felt crappy the rest of the day.

Yesterday morning I did some more and guess what? Same effect. 

Now I am 100% sure it isn't a tolerance issue, so the only thing I can think is that it is the cut. I've never had H that has this effect on me though.

The product is hard as a rock. I mean like VERY hard. To break it up I have to hit it hard several times with a lighter. It is even very hard to shave it using a knife. The color is light tan.

Does anyone have any idea what this could be cut with? I've never gotten a batch that does this to me so I am pretty curious.",1422803112.0

2uekae,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2uekae/histamine_reaction_on_forehead/,7,https://redd.it/2uekae,916x,Histamine Reaction on Forehead?,"Hey guys, so my boyfriend will frequently get histamine reactions from IV BTH on his arms, legs, chest, etc. You know, the raised bumps/blotches of red skin. Usually they don't last long and go away within an hour or two, and taking a 25mg diphenhydramine pill or two helps it go away even faster (though occasionally nothing will help and he will have the raised bumps/patches for a few hours before they go away.) Taking some diphenhydramine 20-30 minutes before he IVs will usually prevent any bumps from forming, but again, every once in a while it will happen regardless. Sometimes he forgets to take some or doesn't feel like it because it will sometimes make him drowsy. 

Well, tonight he had these histamine reactions form on his face (well, his forehead anyways.) He took some diphenhydramine (50-75mg, I'm not sure exactly how many he took) and the bumps sort of went down and became less defined at least. It's been 4-ish hours and he still has them though. Is this anything to worry about? We picked up a new batch of tar today and his earlier two shots before this caused a very pronounced, and his very first ever, pins and needles type rush (this most recent shot did not though.) I have not experienced the pins and needles but did experience a small, localized histamine reaction at the IV site on one shot from this batch (I don't normally get histamine reactions, so I'm thinking this dope might just be extra morphine-y? Or something?) Any suggestions on what he should do to try and prevent this? 

**TLDR:** We picked up a new batch of BTH today and my boyfriend got raised histamine reaction bumps/splotches on his forehead. He took 50-75mg diphenhydramine and 4 hours later the bumps are still there, but less defined/raised. Should he be worried? Any suggestions?

Actually, to make this opiate related, I kinda thought it would be cool to post a question or two every day and have you guys answer it. Sometimes it would be about the past, sometimes about your thoughts on the future, sometimes (like the ones I am asking below) the questions will be about the present, just things about your day as a junkie (or not). I love reading stories and personal anecdotes from you all. It's honestly my fave part of this sub and I want to ask questions that can either be answered with a quick sentence or can inspire someone to tell us a crazy ass story.

I just love reading that kinda stuff here. Makes me feel like when I was in detox for the first time, wearing scrubs and sitting around a table eating cookies and trading war stories with a bunch of junkies I had just met. I'll ask a few questions in this post & see how it goes.

It is not necessary to get that yucky black soot all over the bottom side (and all over everything else when the shutters slip down).  Unless your day job is chimney sweeping, you probably have shown up somewhere (like I have) with telltale soot marks in places you hadn't noticed - and without a good excuse.  

Solution:  use a refillable flame and buy the good gas (5x or 7x refined) from a reputable corner store/ head shop/ bodega).  Don't fill with Ronson or similar big name company products  they are just like bic.  In my experience the 5x gas was always cheaper anyways  and definitely better.  IT LEAVES NO SOOT!

I'm running low on my script of oxy and need to taper off while I can. I have enough to do 7-6-5-4-3-2-1. I'm on a clonidine patch and have gabapentin. 

I can either stop ct and use gabapentin like every month to hide most of the symptoms, and try to get sleep somehow, then maybe by day 5 start my stims. 

Or I can start the stims tomorrow while tapering and hope it makes the taper even easier, maybe letting me squeak by on a few half pills )1 every 6 h or so)

Will stimulants take the place of opiates if I take the bare minimum to stay out of physical wd? 

I'm on about 110mg oxy on average days and my stims Are vyvanse 30 and adderall IR 10. 

Which would you pick? Try to taper off the oxy slower by using stims (esp vyvanse since it is long acting and not as dramatic) or do it fast with gaba and clonidine and try to hold tight and start the stims After a week clean?

Fwiw I think these new meds will fix the part of me that craves low dose speedy opiates like oxy.

I'll be quick since I'm in a lot of pain and seem to have a rising fever.

Had 3 hemorrhoids cut out Wednesday afternoon.  Went well, was pretty sore but I got Percocet.  Yeah!  Decided the thought of shitting would be too much to bear so I drank two bottles of magnesium citrate.  Figured I would turn my bowels to water, lots of diarrhea, no pain.  Easy!

I shit straight acid for hours.  This burned my (freshly shaven) asshole, surgical wounds and cheeks so bad I was shaking all over and had to have our nurse neighbor come over.  Found out I wasn't taking as much Percocet as I was prescribed, bumped it up since then.  She about sent me back to the ER but the pain management worked.  

Got out and shopped today, moved around.  Pain's getting really bad again and the Percocet ain't getting it, or will soon lose it.  I'm terrified I have an impacted ""tar baby"" or whatever the fuck it's called.  I'll NEVER get that past the stitches, etc.  Been drinking tons of water, taking stool softeners etc.  Drinking a martini too since that always loosens me up.  Keep cramping up but nothing comes out.

If you're advice is to go to the ER I appreciate the thought but this is not an option.  I've already spent nearly $1,000 on this and there's a $300 ER co-pay.

I've only taken them when I need them, for pain.  I've probably taken 20 percs in my life . . . I've taken vicodin and that crap but it's not even worth taking, may as well take an advil.

That all being said kind of a mini story and then maybe a few questions.

So, I had a really bad sore throat a while back, and my friends always have plenty of pills and crap, so I said ""Hey u have any pain pills?  My throats killing me.""

He says ""Oh yha sure"" and drops me 4 percs.  2.5mg

I take one 2.5 perc, and my pain goes away.  I get a good nights sleep and all is well.  

The next day, I see another friend of mine, he says ""Oh so and so said you have a sore throat, I have some percs if you want any.""  I'm not going to say no to a stash of some pills, cuz well I may be in pain at some other time.  So I say sure, and I take 3 percs from him.  Different size and shape, but I dont even look at them.

So that night, I take one of the new guys percs and about maybe an hour later, I'm not feeling anything (not rare for me as oral route for drugs is so damn slow for me),  but I'm like ""fuck it, I'll take another to get it going""

Then . . . o my god.  I got SO damn high.  I had to go lay down and just touch all over my body, and I was itching like CRAZY, but I was enjoying it.  I have never really been ""high"" on an opiate before, I just have always used them for pain.

I look at the pills.  10mg percs.  I didnt even know they MADE them that high.  I figured they were 2.5mg or similar.  

So I spend the whole night scratching everywhere until literally 4 in the morning.  I gotta get up for work at like 6 so I 2 hours sleep.  I wake up.  Throw up immediately . . . and I have the worst headache ever.

So I'm telling my friend and he says ""Just take 5mg of perc and the headache will go away.""

So I pop 5mg, and I the most strangest sensation of my life. I felt completely ""okay"".  I didnt even feel high, I just felt like nothing was wrong.  Work was SOOO easy that day.  Nobody could piss me off.  No matter what happened, I could literally smile at anything.

So okay this is a long post, and I'm wanking off here talking about myself, but this comes around to my question.

Is that feeling of ""okay"" the much discussed ""addictive"" side to opiates?  If I could feel like that every day, my life would be so much easier.

Needless to say, I ran out of pills and . . . well life goes on.  I dont want an opiate addiction . . . 

But if I had a stash of pills . . . it would be hard not to take them . . . just to ""get through the day"".",1422741153.0

****update: I'm feeling much better, things were talked about in a positive manner and resolved. It feels so great that you guys had concerns/ etc! Makes me feel cared about!! If any of you have a problem, I'm always here too xo!


Im pretty sad, and while this doesn't have too much to do with opiates, I really love you guys and some of my friends on here have helped me through a lot.

Im having problems with my boyfriend. You see, he's a great guy. Well put together, intuitive, respectful, successful, etc. I've never known a relatinship that was proper. That was loving, and non abusive. But this relationship is everything i want. 

But as such, I have this ex I was with before my current so. A real piece of shit I was with for years. So a few months ibto my current relationship, I decided I needed to get things from my ex, and that I needed to have him start psying me back for things monetarily, as he said that was the time hed be able to. So I hungout with my ex a few times (wouldn't even go as far as saying hanging out) and got what I needed/ was promised. My ex realized when I told him i was in a relationship that I was really for this guy I'm currently with. 

This is where shit gets shitty. My ex messaged my bf on fb claiming we still had a whole secret relationship which wasn't true. I denied to my bf BC well.. It wasnt true. My ex kept pushing that I must of cheated if a hoodie that's mine was at his place, which I left on accident while grabbing my things. He sent a picture of it to my bf. So i told my bf that I indeed did see him, and i did leave the jacket there.. But hadn't had sex with my ex. My bf didnt particularly believe me, and I kind of understand why, bit staywd with me, saying he loves me too much to leave.

Cut to now, we were just on the phone. And he wanted to know how he could trust me more, which irritates me when it comes up because i didn't cheat. He kept saying what my ex was saying didn't add up, but he's just scared of it being true.

So I get upset, I'm crying. Then we start talkibg about love, our sexlife and such. It came up yesterday that certain sexual things may remind you of other sexual past partners.  I know this to be true for other people, and see why. But its not that way for me. I have a past of sexual abuse, etc. So he asked me what i remember my exes for. I replied tgat it was nothing good, because of the abuse that went on. Then i asked what he remembers his exes for. He said his first ex had a nice pussy, second one gave great bjs. With backstory, im a little shy in the bedroom, inexperanced i guess? This is due to sexual and physical abuse from every man ive been with. But we've been working on making me comfortable, and things that I enjoy in the bedroom. 

Anyhow, so then i ask what the intimate thing about me he loved was. And he said ""uhhh idk."" I kinda got upset because i try really hard to make him as happy sexually as he makes me. So then he said (every couple has ""sleep sex"" so i dont want to hear that its abuse,)  but he then said that i was the first girl who didn't wake up while he was trying to have sex as i slept in a frumpy voice. I know he did not mean it in a way he said it, at all. But it huet that i guess that's what came out of his mouth, instead of that i was a great kisser or something.  He said that there wasnt anything yet, and that it'll take time. Which I understand. But it stil hurt. 

Revealig that im sexually inexperenced is embarassing and touchy for me, especially for someone my age. I try so hard for him, and have made very good progress. So it just hurts when it doesn't get noticed a lot. 

Im not even sure how to explain this farther. And that was just as best as i could explain my sadness situation. Thats not even the whole story or anything. I just had to tell someone I guess. Has anyone been through anything like this? Maybe try to help me cheer up? Because itd mean the world. Thanks & much love.",1422867038.0

First thing I realized is that dealers, of at least mine, doesn't have as many friends as I first thought. When drugs aren't involved people of course agree to help, but most ended u bailing on him. I've known the guy since first grade but we never really hung out much outside of school and always just imagined he had many friends. only 3 of us showed up.

The second thing that sank in was that I am too nice to people. For the first 2 hours or so it was just me and him. I'm only 5'1"" 120 and I busted my ass helping fill 2/3 of a box truck before the other 2 dudes even arrived. It took around 6 hours all together and I did it for free.

The last thing I didn't know until the next day but I had met my dealers dealer. It's a weird thing to think about. The dude was super nice and chill too. A bunch of other random things went wrong too that made the night worse but I've already rambled on for too long. Just a weird night.

Neither of us can find a pain doctor in our town. She has 3 disc protrusions in her back and 3 in her neck, gets severe migraines ect.. I get migraines as well and have 1 protrusion in my back. I was on oxycodone 15 mg 3 a day for like 2 years, my pain doctor would always hit on my fiance and say rude things to her, finally i told him enough is enough and She and I would report him or file a sexual harassment suit on him if he didnt stop. Next time I come in I get urine tested, which hasnt happened in the 2 years of me going there and it happens to come up for morphine. Needless to say I never took any but cant do shit about it so i was screwed. Her she got 15mg also from a different doctor, she went to visit her father in another state and got hurt, went to the er and they gave her morphine, she figured 3-4 days would be enough for it to get out of her system before she got back to town. Well 8 days later they call her in for a piss test and she shows for morphine (we went to seperate doctors btw). So she gets screwed. Now her doctor will not send her to a pain doctor. The last time they did, they wrote do not prescribe opiates on her record because she is so young (23). How is that legal, let alone moral. When she complains to them of her pain their exact words were. Thats tough luck, we really dont care you are too young to be on pain meds.  So recently we have had to switch to using H and as everyone knows you cant just take it once and a while (well you can but it doesnt happen fast and short acting ect..) I have no freaking idea what to do. Personally I cant even see my pcp because there is a 4 hour wait and im to sick to sit there. Its so funny too because even after 3-5 days of no opiates Im still in full blown withdrawl or what appears to be. Ive come to the conclusion that because Im diabetic my nervous system must be fucked. I mean when I first hurt my back I went in to full blown withdrawl after taking 3 7.5 vicodins for 3 days in  a row and was called a liar by every doctor i talked to about it. Anyone else having trouble now that the dea feels the need to legislate what amount of pain people feel? Also not sure if this is considered sourcing or not but has anyone been to the Hope Pain Clinic in the east coast and are they legit or is it a waste of money because ive read reviews saying its great unless your a junkie because they are strict to Doctors made people get multiple mris, then come back, make them pay the fee again, get another mri, pay fee, get no meds ect... I cant go there because I read the check for track marks and i screwed up my arms about a year ago when I lost my prescription but my fiance should be fine if thats the case.

I just dont see how they expect a girl to hold down a nursing job when she has to lift people 200-400lbs at times, bend constantly pick things up ect... and just ""ignore"" any pain she is in even though its documented

tldr;

Doctored flirted with fiance, screwed me over.

I, on the other hand, am not one of those people. In fact, there's not a MacGyver type bone in my body.

So here's what I need from you's. I snort H. I want to rig something up where I can dump all my bags into a container of some sort, but have it set up so I can tilt it to the side until my desired dose is separated from the rest of it (so I don't accidentally bump the whole stash). Essentially what I'm picturing is something with 2 chambers that would seperate the two.  Ideally, I'd like for there to be a straw or something that flips out when opening the container or whatever, but I'm willing to negate that part. It's not that hard to stash a straw somewhere and pull it out whenever I need it.

Alright folks. So there it is. To sum it up, I need a container or something that has a ""wall"" separating the 2+ buns worth of dope from the empty chamber. It needs to somehow have the ability for me to tap, tilt, or bang little bits of powder from the full to the empty chamber to avoid me sniffing from the big pile.

But this is virtually the only spot I've been able to use for over a week, I shoot probably 8-10 times a day. I can hit other places but for some reason don't feel that dilly rush at all when I do, even when I know I'm not missing (if anyone knows what could be causing that also I'd love to know, couldn't find anything on google).

I feel like punching walls and ripping my hair out. I can't help but look at photos of us, hold his clothes, lay on his side of the bed. Then I immediately burst into agonizing fits of hysteria. It's so fucking brutal. This is the worst pain I've ever felt in my life. Heroin is a sinister drug and an even more cruel addiction. I can't help but feeling I could have done something to prevent this tragedy from happening. He's been clean for about a month and a half now and he has been adamant about taking care of his responsibilities. He didn't seem depressed or troubled, oh god how I wish I read him better. I was with him that night, up until about 9. He died sometime after I left. I love him so much. I miss him so fucking much. I miss his touch, I miss waking up next to him in the morning, I miss drinking coffee together and making breakfast, I miss his gorgeous eyes and cheeky smile, I miss his laugh, I miss everything about this man. This shit is brutal. I mean fucking horrifying and excruciating. God dammit I just wish he would have talked to me before he took that fatal shot. I wish so badly I could've helped.

Im not gonna bother asking how to dose it cause I understand ow wildly the quality can vary. Anyway I put about 10-12 ounces in an empty 32oz gatorade bottle and filled it with about 16 ounces of water and a few squirts of lemon juice. I shook the fuck out of it for a solid 10 minutes (my arms are really tired) and went to strain it thru an old undershirt. the bottle I was straining it into didnt have a very wide mouth. Maybe a little bigger than the gatorade bottle. I had to pour out a little at a time because the seeds would accumulate and end up spilling over if i didnt.

Anyway my question is this: Since I had to stop and start the seeds would settle and it got to a point where I had to add more water to get them to come out. Does anyone have a way to get them all out in one go? I thought of my pasta strainer but when I went to inspect it I found the holes were too big to strain the seeds.

Also I was skeptical about this working but I'm actually feeling a little something. I saved as much of the seeds I used as I could(still made a huge mess and lost a lot) and I figure Ill wash those again with maybe another 10-12 ounces next time. I read you can wash them up to 3 times. Does anyone know how much of the alkaloids you wash off the first time? Just curious.

And it's been about the same amount of time since I've returned, and the only reason I've done so is to say I've done it. I've done the impossible, I've gotten clean. This is something I never thought I would be able to do. And if anyone would care to listen to a story... here it goes. On July 3rd of last year I was dropping off a ""friend"" after 4 of us had just picked up. As he got out of my car I decided I couldn't wait any more and, while in front of this man's house, put the rig in my vein. The same act I had preformed countless times before. Except this time was different, this time it was too much, this time I overdosed. For anyone on this sub who has never experienced this sensation before, I can assure you that it's nothing like you imagine. For one you don't know it's coming, there is absolutely zero warning, you feel the greatest rush of your life and then....... nothing..... and that's what I felt. Then, suddenly, I was awake, vomiting, shaking, sweating, freezing, confused. I looked around the back of the ambulance, I had absolutely no idea why I was there. A voice said to me "" welcome back buddy, we almost lost you there."" I looked at him... then looked down at myself in the stretcher. I had on an oxygen mask around my face. My shirt was completely covered in sweat. I was more confused than I've ever been. I remember asking the EMT what had happened, he told me I was 2 minutes away from being dead, and that I was lucky to be alive. The proceeding ambulance ride to the hospital was a blur of worry and fear. And when I arrived I can only remember planing a way out. But a police officer from my town, who happened to know my family, recognizing my name from the database or whatever police use, and informed my family. I just remember sitting in that fucking emergency room bed thinking of ways to get out, and then my mother walks in. I've never felt worse. In the days that followed I received a warrant in that mail. Had court, got a year of probation, and a bullshit OUI charge just because I was in my car When all this went down. I'm currently 6 months into the probation and am doing great. In a suboxone clinic and am doing really well. For any of you that are thinking of stopping it's not as hard as you think, the clinic has been a big help for me, and believe me you don't want to risk an OD before you decide to quit.

It's the first time I've ever had to format a submission. So bear with me! Thanks guys! Now for the important stuff...

 I've seen a few comments today where people were saying that it was too difficult to make it to the 24 hour mark so they could begin taking subs without experiencing precipitated withdrawals. I just thought I would point out that you don't necessarily have to wait this long to begin induction. You only need to wait until you're in at least mild, but preferably moderate withdrawl. The severity of withdrawls can be measured using the Clinical Opiate Withdraw Scale, a.k.a. COWS. The link at the bottom is for a worksheet that you can use to figure out what stage of withdrawal you're in. It also summarizes how buprenorphine works, when you should begin taking it, and what precipitated withdrawals are. 


This is a little something from the link about when to begin taking subs... 

To avoid precipitated withdrawal, physically dependent patients must no longer be experiencing the agonist effects of an opioid. One way to gauge this is to observe objective symptoms of withdrawal sufficient to score a minimum of 5 to 6 on the COWS (Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale). Scores of >10 are preferable. Due to patient individuality, required abstinent times may vary considerably from patient to patient. Only use the time since last use as an estimate to anticipate the onset of withdrawal symptoms.

The social worker asks me, ""do you exercise?""

I say, ""I try to but it's hard because I smoke."" 

He says, ""Yeah but it kills you! Heroin doesn't kill you unless you OD.""

I laughed, and then he didn't laugh. I was like, dude are you fucking serious?

He goes on to say that studies were done and shit and how heroin should be legalized or at the very least decriminalized and then it wouldn't be as harmful. He said that cigarettes are explicitly unhealthy and dangerous whereas there's no reason to believe that heroin actually isn't bad for you so long as you don't OD.

I was just so stunned. I know where he's coming from completely and I definitely agree with him to an extent. 

But, two things:

1. What kind of mental health professional would tell a (newly clean) drug addict that heroin should be legalized? lol. it's a shame he doesn't write my scripts.

The rush is incredible, but the nearly nonexistent high afterwards leaves me feeling like I just got my dick teased with no hope of busting a nut.

I experimented with mixing some dope into my shot. That was nice, but my scale broke a couple weeks back and I was really nervous about overdoing it since I was eyeballing my smack. With a scale, I believe this would be a great way to get the most out of that precious dilly.

Last night I prepped a fat shot of ketamine. I wanted to k-hole, but again because of the lack of a scale, I was nervous. I know I would have had to have done a hell of a lot more to reach an anaesthetic dose, but I tend to vomit when I do K, so still, nervous. I didn't want to go full K-hole and have to deal with throwing up. So I IM'd my K, and about 7 minutes later I realized I hadn't done nearly enough.  
So with my robot legs on, I walked over to my table and started prepping another shot. I'm typing on my phone so I'll spare you the details, but this shot was beautiful and put me right where I wanted to be. 

Anywho, this brings me to the current time. I just got back from the dentist, and was anxious to do some dilaudid. When I got my spoon out, I realized that in the haze of my K trip last night, I had left a lot of kitty on my spoon. Instead of cleaning it, I decided to leave it there for my shot. I poured out 6mg of dilaudid, put 90units of water, mixed that bitch up right, and drew up through a cotton. 

I always double filter my dilaudid, so I cleaned the spoon, emptied the barrel back into it, cleaned the rig out a bit with some water, and drew it back up through another cotton. 

I got situated watching some Gumball, tied off, registered, let the tourniquet off, and pushed the plunger down. Now I've never IV'd ketamine, so I was kinda nervous. But the rush hit immediately and was just as great as always. I started the timer on my watch to see if the k affected the duration of the high at all, and laid back. The high was not letting up after what felt like a significant amount of time, and I looked down and realized the rushing sensation was just starting to leave at about 7 minutes. This is more than twice as long as it usually lasts for me. And as I type this sentence, it still feels like the dilaudid is keeping me warm. It's been about 30 minutes since the shot.  
I usually feel a dill shot for around 30 minutes, but that's about the very tail end of the high, and its barely noticeable by then. Right now I feel warm and comfortable and how I usually do at like t+7-8 minutes. 

Maybe it's just cuz I've never IV'd K, but this is so great I had to share.

My dream opiate is one with the rush of dilaudid and the duration of oxy, so anything that extends the dilaudid high is fucking primo in my book.

I'd estimate there was about 25-35mg of k in my shot. 

Much love.",1422995938.0

I still use daily, but I use less than I did. I was on about 0.25g over the course of a day. These days I'm averaging more like 0.10g (I have a milligram scale and I weigh this stuff and it's accurate). So I'm doing less than half of my old habit.

Went to see the drugs worker I'm in contact with yesterday, who (and btw I'm terrible at social cues and that shit) seemed to be offering reassurance for some reason, like as if because I'd not quit completely that must be a 'bad' thing, idk what she thinks that I'm thinking and idk what she's thinking. I'm rubbish at mind-reading.. But yeah I got all this ""oh its ok, don't worry, you're in the right direction at least..."" when I was actually pretty damn happy with how much I'd cut down. Now I feel confused, am I not doing this fast enough for most people?

Anyway, forgetting her. Other thing is that despite using less, my suicidial depression is back at the forefront. H was my mask, my way to cope with the fact that I wanna kill myself and I thought about that on a minutely basis. Idk how the fuck people cope without a cruth when they're depressed like this, be it drugs, drinking, whatever. I anticipate all the 'go get help' replies and I do have a meeting with a ""mental health team"" in a couple of weeks, but in the past (ie, my whole adult/teen life) I've been ""depressed"" and getting ""help"" which led nowhere.

Now I'm not saying that I wanna go back to having a hard-to-control addiction, because I definitely do not want that. There were several serious factors that led me to wanna quit/reduce a lot, and I'm very glad that I've managed to do that, even thoguh it's apparnelty not 'enough'. 

Tangent here now that I remembered this part: she also wanted me to quit using benzos. I have not done this. I do not have a massive benzo habi; I have one which I can (and have, many a time) stop at any moment because its small enough. I take a couple of pills on days when I use it - its to calm me down from legit panic attacks. I don't have 'fun' on benzos and I've never understood how they can be 'fun' or recreational drugs. I use them because I'm a nervous wreck and I need *something* to at least help me cope with that because I don't anticipate a cure anytime soon.

So yeah idk I forgot what I was saying now. I guess I just have mixed feelings. Like I wanna quit because I need to and it was starting to affect things, but I've reduced the amounts by a lot and it's no longer causing issues, but it's highlighting the depression that caused me to start using in the first place, and I have no way to cope with the depression other than blocking it out with the drugs. So at the moment, I'm monitoring myslef taking low amounts of drugs and I know its a stupid thing and believe me it's not what I wanna be doing, but I don't know what else I can do. I don't know any better. I'm fucking 22-years-old and don't know anything *but* crushing depression and anxiety. I just know that I don't wanna get sucked into this addiction again, but I don't know any other way to cope. I hate this shit. 

also disclaimer - depression in my case ain't *caused* by H, it's been there forever and I used H in an attempt to mask it. now it's just resurfacing now that I'm taking away that mask, and I can't deal with it and it's scary.

Shower me with your golden opioid filled knowledge. I don't chase a high. I don't nod. I take opioids to be myself. Oxy was a blessing for me because it allowed me to not only endure social situations but actually flourish in them and finally experience the beauty and freedom of being myself for the first time since i was a kid. So oxy was amazing but too expensive. I always read that I should just switch to heroin but i also read that it was more sedative and i loved the energetic high of oxy and i dont enjoy being tired. People always talked about nodding on heroin and that did not sound pleasant to me at all. But i just couldn't afford Oxy anymore so i tried heroin. It was great! Not sedative for me. It gave me the same energetic high. So that's what i'm doing now. I'm getting #4 powder at about $150-200/g. Yes i know this is expensive but its top notch. But the thing is im snorting it and usually i do about .15 a day when i'm being responsible and that's like $30 a day i could handle that (sort of) but some nights i like to share it with some girls or some close friends and have a fun night and i'll end up spending $100+ :x... What should i do?! Should i change the ROA? I really don't want to shoot up because I need to remain stealthy and i can't be driving around with equipment because i'm on probation. I dont think there is a ROA that is more effective than snorting but not as crazy as shooting up? I feel like i could be wasting a lot with incorrect snorting methods? But I don't know and that's why i come to you guys. Should i switch to something else? Is there a financially better option than heroin? Or should i just stop being generous with my shit? Please feel free to contradict anything i've said with your advice or tell me i'm a dumbass. Just tell me exactly how you feel and give me your best advice regardless.

Something to keep in mind, health is the most important thing for me. I would probably just be taking a couple tramadol a day and saving a fortune but something tells me it's not good for you.

About an hour later I come to on the ground drenched in sweat. Ears ringing. Head throbbing. Chest pounding. And almost completely deaf. I could see his girl crying and screaming but couldn't hear her. She pointed and I turned to see my buddy still unconscious on the ground with a weak pulse and barely breathing. I could read her lips as she begged me to help him as if my overdose had somehow miraculously turned me into a paramedic. I told her to call an ambulance and tried to get my friend to respond. When the ambulance got there and the paras got inside I split. As we dont have a good Samaritan law here and the cops surely weren't far behind. To this day I wonder how the fuck I ended up off the bed and on the ground.,1423116346.0

Recently I have sacraficed every thing that now seems like a luxory so every last dollar that isnt in my gas tank or used on smokes get used on dope. Its not like im cutting out 100 dollars a week of bullshit spending its only 10-20 dollars but damnit thats another point or 2 of dope! Soda has always been an addiction if mine especially mountain dew. I have always hated drinking water because its fucking boring. Over the last couple months I have sacraficed my daily 1 litre of dew for work and my maybe 1-2 days of something for lunch other than the peanut butter sandwhiches I pack everyday. A family member, who I hadnt seen for a few months, asked the other day what I was doing to lose weight. I hadnt noticed it myself but I have lost a little bit of weight, not as much as she thinks but 10-15lbs over the last 3-4 months. Which I am happy with anways, Ive always been overweight especially in my teenage years. Im down to 260lbs which was like my weight in like 7th or 8th grade. But anyways I looked at het and chuckled claiming I wasnt doing anything special, I do however know its from cutting out luxories like soda, and lunches that dont come from home. Also skipping the occasional meal to save a few extra bucks doesnt hurt either. Quit smoking cigs and I could add another 60-70 bucks a week to my use but I cant quit smoking. Dopes got me by the balls and the smokes have a very firm grasp on the shaft.

So my question what ""luxorys"" have you cut out in order to put every penny possible towards your drug use. Things that werent luxories before addiction got you.",1423113077.0

We had gotten on the topic of opiates and plugging and we were having a debate whether it was gay or not to participate in this activity.  I personally did not think it was homosexual and was fighting him tooth and nail.

I got so irritated that at one point I raised my voice to near yelling and said

Heres the deal, my first real experience with opiates was when I had them prescribed for surgery percs and tramadol. This was in the summer of 2014 so like 8 months ago. 

I was actually on opiates for 4 weeks straight because there were complications with my surgery and I was in massive pain.  Once I got well enough to get off I actually experienced withdrawal from them.  Probably due to the length of time I was on them but also probably cause I abused them (ie. taking 30mg of oxy at a time).  My withdrawals were for sure mild, but suffice to say shitting 9 times in a day is something I dont want to experience again.  Also RLS is definately the worst thing I experienced (among yawning, watery eyes, diarheara and general flu like feeling).

Anyways, since getting off them in the summer I've done:

Poppyseedtea 3 times
Morphine (100MG) once
and Oxy 45MG once

I naturally have a high tolerance to opiates as 100mg of morphine didnt give me nods, neither did 45mg of oxy.

Anyways I obviously enjoy opiates and my sort of rule I've set myself is no more than once per month - NO EXCEPTIONS.

The last time I did any opiate was some poppyseedtea about 1.5-2months ago.

I recently came into a connect and I know she has opiates and Im willing to bet heroin.

I want to try it.   I dont want to get addicted.  I know the shit I'm fucking with is serious.  I never want to withdraw because my minor withdrawals still sucked donkey dick.

Beings running far away and never looking back.  What sort of rules should I have?

-No more than once a month (is this reasonable?)

I find the longer I go without opiates the easier it is to forget about them and go longer.

Any other rules I should introduce?  I want to minimize damage and risk potential within reason (obviously not doing opiates ever again would be minimizing risk potential)

Today my dude learned a hard lesson and I'm here to spread the word to try and prevent this from happening to anyone else.

My dude's doctor recently switched all patients to a new mail order pharmacy. This pharmacy uses a new system called VeriMed and VeriPak. They ship prescriptions in new blister packs that DIGITALLY FUCKING RECORD when you pop an individual cell and send that information to the prescriber. If you pop all these fuckers open at once the doctor considers you a high risk patient and WILL DROP YOUR ASS like a bad habit.

He will fortunately be getting a second chance at this doctor based on how long he's been there but many others will not be so lucky. He's now on probation with them and has to go in and piss whenever they say so.

I was hoping to inform as well as try to get a dialog going about the pros and con's of this system. It's remarkable in the sense that these packs are just normal looking blister packs with some digital foil. But how much micro managing the lives of legitimate pain patients is worth preventing (actually, slowing this system in no way prevents prescriptions from being sold) people from selling their scripts.

I'll post a link to the company's website in a bit for the curious.

So let me hear it, what do you guys think about this?

Many of you ( and you know who you are ) look to infiltrate almost every topic with your bullshit, your immaturity and most of all your ignorance with nothing more than the intent to cause disruption and disharmony, contributing absolutely nothing fruitful to this forum and discussions and your own opiate use. 

It's starting to get real old now with the :

""I know this pill and you know shit and your a jerk and you have no credibility and I am an internet know it all when it comes to opiates and you don't have your ear to good stuff like I do, and I grew up here and you live there so you know nothing...""

Last night i did meth for the first time. Im an opiate lover and always will be prior to this I have ways stated I hated being sped up. The only enjoyable time ive ever had with coke was mixed in with dope. Speedballs were great but a treat saved for 3-4 times a year. I have done coke on its own, snorted. Ive never shot coke by itself, yet i passionitley told anyone who would listen that i hate uppers. Especially the ones your likley to try first, the pills that are overly prescribed, IMO. Anyways I had always said Meth was the one drug I would never try, and as gaurded and shaded a personal view it was, I saw meth as about as evil as a drug could be. This opinion stayed with even after I tryed opiates in painkiller form like so many of us, eventually moving on to heroin whether to save money or because the pain killers all dissapeared or were fucked with so hard you had to some sort of chemist to abuse the shit now. Every trick we figured out they would make a new, harder to abuse formula. Even after shooting dope the first time and feeling that first real rush, and the warmest, strongest most amazing hug in my life. After becoming a lieing scamin junkie that I am today. Forever addicted to opiates I will be but I hope to beable to say im not a junkie one day. So I do this 20 bag of ice after a quick lesson on loading meth into a rig. Again ive never done it so i pull out a cap and filter out of my pocket as if its the same as dope. Im taught the proper way to do it. I do 10 to see how i feel and 20 minutes later i do the other half. To summarize the experience as quickly as i can ill cover a couple key points.


1. I thought it was going to make me paranoid and uncomfortable as if my head was pounding out of my chest but the only thing speeding was my head.
2. The euphoria was deff. Not dope but i didnt hate it. I realize why some people could be into it and addicted to it like i am to dope. I would do it here and there but i couldnt do this on the regular. 
3. Opiates have always made me chaty and more honest especially to strangers but the meth made me 5 times more chaty. I got home just before 4am. I open FB to see if anyone was online i could chat with but everyone is alseep. I planned on making a quick post summarizing my experience. But it turned into a 9 hour autobiography of my life from my family life growing up all the way to where im at now. It also including my feelings towards treatment of addicts my people who have never dealth with addiction either them selves or someone close to them. I compared being addict the way we are treated making a comparison to homeless. 
4. And my final point was how i hope to be able to be a voice for addicts everywhere and work on getting everyone clean, safe materials and those things. Aswell as trying to enlighten people who have no clue about addiction and the life we live as addicts. I stated that people like tracy are such an inspiration to me and one day i hope to be able to be sober from drugs and use my experience to teach others.
5. This shit has given me super focus on my goal unfortunatley i was so focused on rambling to anyone who would listen that I failed to call the hospital this morning to ask if this lady had any appts availble today to talk with me about finding healthcare i can afford. She gets in at 8:30am its 2:30pm i dont think im getting an appt today so why bother calling. I also have some snow blowing to do but its cold outside and i just wanna sit here chatting up people until they cant take me anymore


A couple of myths i dispelled by using meth for the first time: 
1. The only meth use i had ever seen was in movies and t.v. i thought meth users were super paranoid and none stop moving. Similar to a crack head i know. I was wrong my brain was supercharged but not my body.
2. I thought meth was an evil drug that even as I sat there shooting dope i said, i would never try meth. After trying it I could see how it could consume ones life but I still feel it would be easier to control than opiate addiction

Two things confired from this experiance. 
1. The loss of appetite is for real. Im a big heavyset guy not overly tall 5'10"" and down to 260 lbs my heavyest was like 330 lbs now ive gone from eatting huge meals every 6-8 hours to a slightly less massive meal every 4-5 hours. I normally start getting a little hungry every 4 hours or so. Its 2:20pm and my last food of any sort was around 6pm last night. Im still not sure what the meth comedown feels like. Im finnaly starting to feel hungry but im still talking a mile a minute and wont shut up. Also im at like 22 hours awake and havent yawned once.
2. My teeth fucking hurt from clenching them. Not grinding or anything just teeth on teeth. Me bitting on nothing all night my teeth seriously starting to bother me.



In conclusion im gonna have to do a 20 bag of dope i saved to combat the comedown that ive been warned of but i am going to need to sleep soon i think. I have to work tommorow night at 10pm. And im not even sure with my tolerance of like a 40 to take me out of W/D if this 20 bag will even put a dent in this tweak session im 14 hours into.

I ran into a friend and ended up buying a gram of H off of him but its not pure ECP but not like the tar I've had before either. Its kind of crystal like in places but will get gummy when you try to break it up. 

My question: 
What is the best way to get my moneys worth out of this without resorting back to IV use? I would have no idea how to smoke it because its not like other tar I've had. I tried taking a few smaller pieces and just barely snorting them to where its mostly sitting in my sinuses or mucus membrane hoping it'll absorb there but I feel like I'm wasting it.

It was really expensive and I hate to think I'm just throwing it away especially since the old me is screaming just bang it!

I was psyched because I have blue eyes and this actually works to enlarge the pupils (you need like 6 or 7 drops though)

However, I used the shit out of this over the last 4-5 days to conceal my use during an extended binge. It wound up drying out my eyes, leaving them with a redness that ""red eyes"" Visine only exacerbates. After realizing my mistake I bought natural tears...and it helps...but the lingering redness makes my eyes more conspicuous than they were in the first place (I've been asked if I'm hungover, sick, etc).

So, blue eyed folks, this works - but my experience and common sense suggests not to overdue it.

2uywfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2uywfr/update_on_my_pain_management/,28,https://redd.it/2uywfr,SpecialSause,Update on my Pain Management,"I posted about a month ago about a Physician's Assistant lowering one of my scripts without saying a word to me.  It was my Oxycodone 15mg script that I have been getting for several years now at 120 a month which is one every six hours or four times a day.  Well, without a word to me, she lowered it to three times or one every eight hours which is 90 a month.  The thing that pissed me off more than her lowering my script is that she never mentioned this to me during the entire visit.  The other thing that was odd is that she made me start coming back every 2 weeks instead of 4 weeks.  Again, she didn't say a fucking word to me and the girls at the front office were the ones that had to tell me.  Un-fucking-believable.

So anyway, I kind of got a little bit of an explanation from the Physician's Assistant that I usually see.  She tells me that she may have lowered my meds because I did my pee test and came back with only a little bit of Morphine in my urine and very little, possibly none, Oxycodone in my system.  They also found 3 medicines in my system that they do not prescribe there at the clinic:    
1. Codeine    
2. Tramadol    
3. Hydrocodone

  This is where I sigh and tell her that I have already explained this to 4 other people already.  First of all, I was in the hospital for severe Bronchitis.  After I left the hospital, the doctor had given me discharge orders that told me to stop taking the pain medicines indefinitely.  His reasoning was that opiate pain medicines mess with the respiratory system and with me having severe Bronchitis, he thought it would be better for me to just stop taking them for a while.  This is why the Oxycodone and Morphine were not in my system.  Then they start questioning me about the other medications in my system.  Even though I tell them this shit every time I come in for an appointment, I guess I have to explain it one more time.  The Codeine, I explain, is from my primary care physician that prescribed me Cherritussan AC (which is guaniffessen and codeine) for my cough.  Tramadol is also from my Primary Care Physician.  I constantly tell them that he prescribes this to me.  I tell them that I take it when I drive that way I don't have to load up on the narcotics while I drive.  The truth is that I just use it to keep from withdraws when the narcotics run out.  And then they asked about the Hydrocodone.  And I will be completely fucking honest and say that my heart actually started to pound out of my chest when they asked about that because I honestly have no idea why Hydrocodone was in my system.  I haven't taken Hydrocodone since I was prescribed it like 5 years ago.  It really worried me because I don't know why it showed up in my urine.  And it really worried me because I didn't know if it was going to show up again.  However, it didn't show up again.  Thankfully!  The only thing that I and my wife could think of was that they gave it to me in the hospital without telling me.

Well, anyway.  I went back in to my Pain Management today and they said my urine test came back ""consistent"" so they were putting me back on monthly scripts again.  Thankfully!  Unfortunately, they still have me on the Oxycodone 15mg 3 times a day instead of the 4 times a day.  The lady that I like that I saw today said that I would have to see this other bitch again to get her to change it back.  However, I don't want to see this other bitch again because I'm afraid she's going to start fucking with my meds again.  And worse than that, she could fuck with them and not tell me and send someone else into the room to give me the scripts that way I have no way to dispute the shit.

I think what I am going to do is see if the next time I go in if I can try and garner some sympathy from her.  My wife is giving birth in the next couple of weeks so if I can show her how much it is fucking with my life than maybe she will be more willing to change it back.  And I am not saying that just to get more meds just to have more meds.  I am already in a ton of fucking pain and now that I am without the full amount of pain meds that I've been on, I've just been absolutely fucking miserable.  And once the baby is here,.it's going to be that much more stress and pain.  And I want to be at 100% for my wife, for my baby, and for my other 2 kids as well.  I want to be 100% for anyone and everyone that needs me to be 100%.

Well, thanks for listening to me bitch and moan.  Hopefully everything will work out next time.  Oh, and for those who were wondering why I didn't press the issue this visit, I was supposed to see the stupid bitch that changed my meds this round and they kept me back in her side for 45 minutes (which is very unusual, usually I only wait about 10 minutes once I'm in the back) and I heard them calling her on the phone as well.  Well, after quite a while for waiting, the Physician's Assistant I do like walked in and she already had my prescriptions filled and whatnot.  They usually don't have the prescriptions until after the appointment so I think she knew that I had been waiting there for quite a while for the other lady so she had printed them out for me to get me out of there quick.  So I just left it at that for this time around.  Plus she got me back on the 4 week scripts again instead of the 2 week scripts.  Thankfully.

Again, thanks for listening to my ranting, bitching, and moaning.",1423213548.0

For you long term male users out there who are health conscious, how do you maintain healthy hormone levels? Do you take anything? supplements? testosterone? I'm considering going to the doctor and having them test my testosterone levels. I'm really worried about them. I used to be an extremely sexually active male but since i've started for the past 2 months I haven't thought about sex once ever it doesn't mean shit to me. And even when i force myself to watch porn i can't get an erection at ALL. Finally after 30 minutes of intense visualization and such i can finally get a halfie. But then when i masturbate it actually hurts! Not my penis but my prostate! There's a burning sensation in my prostate everytime i try and like flex my pelvic floor muscles or whatever in order to mainain my semi erection and get things going. I tried massaging my prostate to see if i could help the situation but it hurt pretty bad :/... I did have a really extremely tough bowel movement earlier today do you think it could be related? Maybe i caused some damage?
     Keep in mind i'm using about 70-100mg of dope through my nostrils. So I'm not using a lot. Oh also i'm 21 years old and prior to starting my use i did have some chronic urinary/prostate issues. I had an enlarged prostate and i would experience prostatitis like symptoms. I'm really worried about this non-existent sex drive and I'm really scared to go to the doctor about it because they don't really want to help me they just want to make money off me. It's a business and I don't want to get convinced by some slick talking doctor that I need thousands of dollars in treatment when in reality i dont. Any help is welcomed!",1423212792.0

I've been getting some really great dope lately from a mostly trusted source.The bags are a good size, and the dope is about an 8/10 (10/10 for the city I'm in, though). 

They consistently fill the entire bottom flap of the glassine bags and are folded and taped up cleanly and evenly. 

I've bought them steadily for a while now and developed a decent relationship with my dealer, so I've gotten lazy about checking the bags before I roll out. 

 So far,  so good... until tonight.  

I was going by to pick up $140 worth. I pretty much always cop something like that. I am definitely not nickel and diming the guy to death... rarely do I spend under $100. In fact I'd already copped $140 worth earlier today. I was just getting more so I didn't have to go back to him tomorrow. 

So I roll up to the dark and somewhat sketchy/hot alley to meet him. I wait a few minutes and see hin coming. I am starting to feel a bit rough and in need of a hit, so my anxiety and desire to get my shit and get the fuck home is at a pretty high level. Dude walks up, we exchange some quick pleasantries, do the exchange and I take off. 10 minutes later I am in my house. 

I pull my bags out to check them and every last one of them is taped up all funny and crooked.  at this point I'm a little freaked out so i check them and sure enough, they are all about half of what they should be. It's obvious now that he  went into the bags and dipped the hell out of them. About half of each one I'd say. 

So of course I text him about it. I was non-accusatory and simply mentioned that they are too small.  He goes on to say that it's my fault for not checking them on the spot before I took off and that I should ""know the game"". So... by that logic, it's my fault that he dipped them to feed his habit or make up the extra bags he did himself. I told him I shouldn't need to check them and that I didn't want to put us at risk in that hot ass area while I looked through a bunch of bags. 

So, lesson learned.... always check your bags before you leave the scene, especially if your dealer is a junkie. All in all it could be worse. At least I got some dope and made it home safely. I guess I'm charging this one to the game. Maybe it's a good thing in the end as It has motivated me to just go back to my subs again(but we all know how that goes).",1423206333.0

I drove for three hours basically, to pick up two measly buns, one of which is short, very nearly ran out of gas and had to make four stops because my goddamn gps kept taking me to closed gas stations, my friend (the guy who middles for me) was shorted an ENTIRE bun. I got lost in a state I don't live in. I finally got to my other friend's house. I sat in the driveway for two and a half minutes while waiting for him to get home from picking up his sister, and my fucking car battery died. Great. My student loan bill is due the day before payday, thank GOD my friend offered to spot me for the day. My supervisor at my internship is in the hospital, and no one has any idea what is wrong with her yet after four days of testing. I really like her. This is upsetting, the only truly upsetting thing on my laundry list of shit I didn't need today.

Nothing bad happened today, but I sure have a lot to complain about. I shouldn't complain. I really shouldn't. My middle gave me what I paid for and absorbed the loss himself, and how many people can say that? He gave me gas money for driving his friend and him somewhere after picking up. He gave me a cigarette. Maybe it's because I have a vagina. Who knows. Maybe he's just a nice guy. So I shouldn't complain. But I am anyway.

you helped me ride a bike.  you held on and and jogged beside me as i pedaled blindly trusting you.   and then i flew just like you said would.  i became alive on your cul-de-sac as my cousins cheered...then i looked back and you had let go and i crashed to earth.  but the happiness was real.  you accepted me as your own though your brother was long gone down the junkie path.  i knew you hated mom but you always gave us your attention, time and love.  your winks and smiles got me through the worst.

I am a rent-a-cop if u will. If shit went down all I can do is call the real cops. Anyways I went to a new site tonight ( Working here now ) where a former employee was let go and made threats of violence with firearms on her way out. This isnt an uncommon thing for us ( my company ) to be called in for. I was given this site Tuesday after the site I was supposed to be working was cancelled on monday. So after losing 20 hours of work on monday and thinking I was fucked and left with a 16 hour week my boss calls offering 3 shifts ( thurs, fri and sat ). Fantastic, a little far away ( 60 min drive ) but I now need the hours. From tues until tonight I was given no details besides an address. This isnt a huge suprise and I have become aware of this being a dead end job and that my boss cares only about the income us gaurds bring him. But how can I do my job with no details. I stopped an employee on their way out for a smoke, who let me in the building and directed me to a manager who then gave me the details I needed ( picture, name and vehicle description of terminated employee ) He then tells me the threat included firearms, he knows of her firearm collection at home and that her liscense plate is even a pistol caliber ( .45auto - thats not really it but that would be an example ) My $10/hour aint enough for me to confront a possibley armed and disgruntled bitch. 

Anyways no point other than that my company and especially my boss sucks ass and I sit here in my vehicle in 3 degree F weather, on the lookout for a heavyset, middleaged woman, at midnight, in almost full blown withdrawl thinking about tommorow afternoon when I can fix myself for another day. Just wanted to talk to my community, I sit here at work with only my cell phone to keep me from going insane from bordem. I didnt think 3 years ago, when I got this job, that this would still be my average night at work. I wish I had known then, that my boss was an alcholic who only cared about us employees for the money we make the company. He doesnt care about our happyness or well being, just that we keep bringing him 20+ dollars per hour for our ""services"" I wish i knew in 36 months there would be no raises or advancment and nothing more than a weekly paycheck with varying hours.

* 1) pile up dope on spoon

* 3) dump water onto spoon
* 4) drop cotton in and draw up
* 5) add 1 more drop of water onto spoon
* 6) draw up the remnants of dope in the cotton into your shot
* 7) bang that shit
* 8) with the tiny bit left in your shot, squeeze the plunger tightly with the end of the needle touching your finger so a tiny bit of blood-dope comes out, then just tap that on the inside of your nose as to not waste any

This way gets you all of your dope into you now without having to leave any to cotton and then putting yourself at risk of cotton fever.",1423179496.0

Then a month or three ago I found out an old friend was moving large quantities (which is funny because he didn't do it when I met him, I actually smoked some with him his very first time).  He was living literally a 10 minute walk from me and giving me good deals (unheard of, right?).  Apparently one of his neighbors told the manager they saw traffic at his apartment, and the manager told him he had to move out (without a 30 day notice).  He was working on moving all his stuff out and the police showed up (only a few hours after I was inside his apartment), and apparently they took him away.

I have two people I can call for it, both of which charge more than I want to pay, and both of which are a few miles' bike ride away.  I need a new hookup that is good to me and nearby, so I think I'm going to walk around my neighborhood a bit and see if I can create an opportunity.  I have done this before with little success, but maybe today is a luckier day?

I don't know why I am sharing all of this, but maybe I can make this a worthwhile post by asking all of you to share an experience where you successfully got a new contact.  Interesting experiences and/or unlikely places are welcome and preferred!  I will try to come back in a few hours with a story of my own to post ;)

I'm the dumbass who made the mistake of smoking BTH on foil coated with Ozium...,"Hi guys. If you guys remember me I posted about me freaking out about smoking a reynold sheet of black tar heroin resin and a shitload of ozium. After I finished the dab of the bth I threw it in the garbage. I know smoking BTH isn't healthy, but this freaked me the fuck out smoking an air-freshener known to contain toxins if inhaled.

The lights were turned off since I am in a situation where I have to be stealthy. Although smoking BTH doesn't smell much, I try to be as safe as I can be to avoid detection. I then proceeded to spray the ozium straight into the garbage for even more safe measure, with the charred up BTH-side of the foil facing it... for like 5-10 seconds. Enjoying the relief I just sat there for a few minutes next to the trash... 

I then nodded for a bit then looked in the trash to see that the black tar heroin still looked smokable because the ozium made it look gooey and not burnt up in the dark LOL.... and my dumbass forgot I sprayed it... I then took a hit from it and a good amount of smoke came out....  the ozium -.- At the moment I tasted it I knew I done fucked up... I paniced and made a post here and was literally on the verge of tears if I fucked up my brain or something. Everyone here reassured me that I would be okay and that many people done worse stupid mistakes than I had. It was just unsettling because there is literally ZERO information on the health effects of what happens when you inhale the combusted ozium liquid fumes... and there was a good amount of ozium liquid on the foil too... But thank you all for reassuring me that I'll be okay and that I should be fine. Really, I needed some reassurance from anyone. I couldn't ask anyone of my mistake cause my dope habit is a secret. 

 I didn't feel any different really after I hit it, and the ozium smoke was in my lungs for a good 2-3 sec.... but some of my muscles on my arms and legs were quivering however I think it was due to anxiety. I then went to bed hoping that I'd feel okay. 

I woke up in the morning with the corner of my eyes extremely red and hurting, however I wear contact lenses and I think I scratched my eyes when taking them off. I was really high because I smoked more (being sure no ozium on my foil this time haha) to get rid of some anxiety, and think my nails accidentally scratched my eyes. Well the redness and irriation went away (still a bit red, but much less and is fading back to normal) however I don't really attribute this to the ozium smoked because my eyes were not red yesterday. Anyways, I feel fine for the most part I think. I am walking okay, doing normal things okay, vision isn't impaired... but man was it scary being paranoid. I am a young adult and was worried I did some permanent damage from the ozium combustion directly inhaled from a straw... horrible horrible feeling worst mistake of my life. But I feel completely fine today. Just thought I'd share this update you guys that saw my post. Been drinking lots of water taking vitamins just in case. I am still debating whether or not I should see a doctor sometime in the near future just to be sure I didn't get some nasty thing inside my body... Or do you think I should be good. But anyways thanks /r/opiates for making me feel safe when I had nobody to turn to about this.... really ",1423177285.0

She accepts me for who I am.

A rounded midriff and stretch marks don’t bother my girl. Scars from lonely nights drowned in cheap wine and melancholy don’t faze her. For the first time in my life, I found someone I love.
Laying next to me, caressing my arm, running her freshly manicured, pearly nails down my torso, blissful, I feel all the problems, all the stress, all the memories, melt away. She gives me that safe oblivion you can only dream of when you’re imagining what it’d be like to be truly happy.

The idea of discomfort is an abstract concept that has no place in our relationship, as long as we are together.
I should talk about how we met. Agony was forefront in my mind – my anchor had broken off and it wasn’t coming back. I could no longer form emotional attachments beyond shallow acquaintances due to the fear of loss. I ended up at this house, another replica party to celebrate a ‘friend’ coming one year closer to death. I almost couldn’t face it.

I didn’t want to go; wallowing in self-pity with my then therapist, ‘Gordon’s Gin’ just seemed easier. However, I promised I would go because I missed my ‘buddies’ last birthday. Apathy numbed my face, dragging each eyelid down toward the dark crescents borne of sleepless nights. My lips had forgotten how to smile. Accompanied by sweatpants and a grey hoodie, the ‘suits’ and parents on the journey avoided eye contact.
It used to bother me; yummy mummies with their private school uniformed children neatly dressed. Judgment muted by pursed lips. Thinking I looked like a stock photo for a Centrelink Domestic Violence pamphlet. I like looking at the kids as my ‘before shot’, it takes the sting out of their prejudice.

Entering the house I saw the usual crowd, the people I had to cope with. I made my way down the hallway to greet the host and it was then that she caught my eye. Adrenaline burst through my veins, the piercing sensation is still fresh in my mind. She was like no one I'd ever had before. An aura of glamour and elegance surrounded her.
I craved to talk to her.

I asked one of the guys there about her, he told me, “Man, this girl’s great! Met her a few years back at a party couldn’t get enough of her.” I went on to ask him where she was from; I just couldn’t quite work it out at a guess. “Here and there, buddy. Girl’s gone between Narre Warren, down to Port Melbourne, back to other side of the river, in Caulfield now.” “Is she a friend of the host?” “Maaaateee, she’s friends with everyone she talks to, she’ll find the good in anyone. Lass doesn’t care if your rich or povo, white or black, she’ll give everyone that ego boost hot babes give.”

He spoke so highly of her.

I was fascinated.

I approached her, shaking nervously. We made eye contact – I was immediately mesmerized. Her beautiful, mysteriously cold eyes looked directly into mine. Nervously, I took another step towards the stained couch and sat down next to her. It took me by surprise that she initiated the conversation, usually I was assigned the chore. We sat there, talking for hours. Absorbed by her comforting tone I soon zoned out. Just as I recollected my self, out of the blue, her lips seductively whispered the words to spirit me away once more. She took me to the upstairs bathroom and rekindled the long lost happiness and fulfillment in my life. It was then I realized we weren’t alone.
We started slow; once a week. Her company was exactly what I needed to help me forget my worries after long days of existence. Soon the relationship progressed and we saw each other a few times a week. Engaging in hours of personal intimacy. It didn’t take long for me to fully open up to her. I had never connected so intensely with anyone. I would rely on her to calm my nerves and help me forget about everything; all the day to day bullshit I had to put up with, be it people or general stress. I felt her become a part of me. Her beauty always on the forefront of my mind; her delicate touch on my skin; her tranquility passing through my veins. She was the type of girl who you could blow thousands on. Not because you had to - she never asked for anything beside your company – yet for her, I would spend it all.

Hook. Line. Sinker.

We saw each other daily. School, work, other people; nothing else mattered. I could give up everything just to spend one night with her, to fall asleep smiling. She was always with me, calming my nerves. Whispering gently how she’s always going to be there.
But there’s one thing they don’t tell you about love in all the movies. When it’s love that makes you feel like you can raise oceans and tear down mountains, you can’t be apart from the one who makes you feel that. And you will do anything to be with them again.

Those long nights without her made me crazy. The cold sweats, the shivers, the nightmares. Paranoid I’d never see her again. Those nights drove me desperate and manic. Thinking how to scrape up money for her, just to please her. Despair began to crawling back into my life. She is my love. She gives me reason to live. Yet love comes at a price wealth cannot cover.
The bruises of her affections left marks on my skin

She broke down my morals.
She ravished my body.
She continues.

An unending cycle, reeling me back. I don’t think I can carry on. But there is no replacement. No one else I will love more than her. And only now, laying in destitution, devoid of independence I realize… My relationship with her will never end.",1423299038.0

I wrote it in reflection without expecting anyone to read all this, but I posted thinking maybe there's value somewhere to someone.
 

*Anticipatory TL;DR: 5+ yr junkie gets clean in jail, completes treatment and starts a better life only to use again and regress to total junkiedom.*
 
 
  

**INTRODUCTION**

I love opiates. It's my jam. Ever since snorting my first vicodin in high school it has been my favorite class of drugs. I was a big drinker and huge pothead during and after high school. But when I found a good plug for original OC80s, my opiate use increased and replaced other habits. Then I found a solid line for 4mg hydromorphone, aka Dilaudid. This was my drug of choice for a almost a year.  I was snorting for most of it. Eventually I got a syringe from a friend with diabetes who also banged drugs. After switching to IV use, I started picking up heroin. Beautiful black tar that was cheaper and better than pain pills.

My evolution as a junkie was marked by the loss of property, jobs, interests, dignity and honor. I swirled the drain towards ""rock bottom"" for about 3 years. I kept up appearances at first with family, but eventually stole from them and caused a period of mutual excommunication. I held jobs at first, but lost them due to tardiness and absence caused by the necessity to pick up. Eventually I found myself homeless, supporting my habit with crime and hustling. I would sell shoplifted stuff on craigslist or trade to my dealer for dope. I had a decent crime spree, lasted a while with far less consequence than risked. I had a “spider key,” the magnetic key that unlocks the wrapped metal wire and security device found on expensive electronics in retail stores. I went almost every day, borrowing cars or getting rides to different stores.  One Best Buy in particular yielded dozens of cell phones. I'd deactivate the security device with my key, put the box under my sweater or in a shopping bag, and walk out the door with 1, 2, sometimes even 3, phones valued at up to $300. Being the newest models they sold quickly on craigslist, usually the same day I acquired them.

**LEGAL CONSEQUENCE**

But my record couldn't stay perfect. Possession of the magnetic key is an automatic felony in my state, and one night the Wal-Mart assets protection team busted me. Luckily the stolen item was only a DVD set.  But they found the spider key and the cops were called. When he ran my name a warrant came up in another county for misdemeanor check fraud, which had been another source of drug money. So I spent the night in jail and was transferred to the other county to deal with the warrant. They released me on my own recognizance ~36 hours after arrest.

So I left the jail, sick as a dog. I caught the bus towards the dope house. The fact that I had a court dates in two counties was buried under the more pressing concern of getting well. Get well I did, and returned to the pattern of theft to continue using. The court dates came and went in my absence, and two bench warrants followed, but I was able to avoid consequence for almost two years.

**STAKES RAISED**

At some point I managed to create the opportunity to become a small time dealer. A source of mine I'd known for years agreed to front me.

I like to pretend I was a great dealer. I hate the all-to-common tendencies of the average dope dealer. Never answers the phone, inaccurate time estimates, unreliable, uncaring for the plight of the junkie, seemingly blind to the fact their customers keep them in business and disrespectful towards them, basically a poor general attitude I like to call “the man syndrome.""

For the most part, I tried to avoid these behaviors, but as a dealer sometimes they were unavoidable.  It keeps one very busy and can be very maddening. For all my efforts to be a better class of dealer, I'd get annoyed at the masses of junkies that relied on my actions.  Some were forced to wait hours when I'd promised minutes, I'd be unreachable for several hours and dismissive if I did answer.  But offense was given by both sides; people I counted as friends stole from me and lied through their teeth. Life was just stressful. But, even so, I had dope and money everyday, and a room I could pay for with dope. People would do me favors and dared not piss me off. Vast improvement over homelessness and constant commission of crime.

But what goes up must come down, and my risky situation eventually caught up to me. Leading up to my arrest there was definite heat building up, vibes feeling like police interest pointed at me. Certain events only confirmed it. I attempted to change it up to shake the heat, and made it another couple months. But I could tell police recognized me. It was only a matter of time.

**INCARCERATION**

One day, walking down the sidewalk, an undercover pulls behind me, ""Stop right there."" When I asked what's going on they just say, ""you've got warrants."" So they got me. When they searched my bag they found a bottle of methadone, not mine. Possession charge.

The detectives acted like it was a random stop, but they obviously had intel on me. They were waiting for me at a specific location. So someone snitched me out. Damn.

Before they took me downtown, we stopped at their precinct office to have a chat. They gave me the option to be a confidential informant. I toyed with them pretending to consider it, asking smart ass questions and snide remarks. I know how the game works and a C.I. is not easy thing police would have you believe. It's a shit deal, and dangerous depending on the parties involved.

Anyway my other warrants guaranteed a decent stay in jail. Even if I set up some big arrests for them that night, there was no avoiding it. Eventually they gave up convincing me to snitch. Grinning and feeling badass I said, ""sorry, officer, but I won't help you. Take me to jail, please.""

So. Fuck. I'm about to kick a dealer-sized habit. Daily total of ~1.5g, IV. My state has been said to have some of the best quality in the nation. I was about to enter hell.

I had to go to court everyday for my first three days. So instead of wallowing in my cell I had to go sit in the holding cells with 20 other guys for 6-8 hours. And these cells are freezing. Each day my court date was moved to the next because my charges hadn't been finalized.

I've never been so sick. Lost my only hope of getting out. My girlfriend had almost gathered enough to bail me out, but got arrested a few days after me. All I knew at the time was she stopped answering my calls.

I was in a sorry state. The nurse had nothing that might help. I was on my own. Couldn't eat more than a few bites for the first few days; I gave away nearly full trays of food. I'd throw up several times a day and couldn't sleep for even a second. Pain of mind and body, hopelessness and depression.

After about a week I had improved. I could eat and sleep for a few hours at a time. Started actually talking to people and passing some of the time out of my cell instead of isolating myself. Eventually I felt normal. Passed the days by reading a ton of books, working out, playing cards, etc.  The best thing about my jail time was learning chess. I'd known the rules but had never truly engaged in the game. By the time I left jail, I had become as good as the best players. A lifetime skill I had finally had time to learn.

After recovery to full health I was grateful it had happened. I was solving my legal troubles and in position to get my life back on track. I contacted my parents after 2 years of avoidance and we repaired our relationship. They told me they were proud of me for working to live a better life.

**CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY TREATMENT**

After 88 days in county, I was conditionally released on probation. I went straight to a court-ordered treatment program, picked up directly from jail.  It was heaven after getting used to jail.  Hot showers and real food and real clothes.  I was quick to find the good side of my counselor and staff.  I acted my part, saying meaningful things in groups.  Among my peers, free from staff, I was cynical and uninterested.  No one likes a know-it-all, and enthusiastically sober people are equally annoying in treatment.

A good group of guys went through at the same time I did. It would have been much more difficult without good company. Most seemed sincere in wanting to get clean. I did, too, up to a point.  I couldn't deny my junkie days were awful. Now I was free from the shackles of withdrawal. I spoke the truth when I “shared” in group, and definitely wanted a better life. But in secret, the back of my mind  knew I'd use heroin again. I was unwilling to forsake my love for it. 

If I had tried to detox in treatment, I'd never have lasted. But three months of jail workouts and regular meals got me in the best shape I could remember. So advantaged, I was an A+ student. My counselor loved me. Vocabulary and oratory skill can be sparse among the average treatment population, so good conversationalists are appreciated by the staff. I was playing the game and I was good at it. All the while I planned to use again. I wanted to stay clean for a while and avoid trouble with probation, but when the risk decreased I felt I could keep it together, chipping. No worries. Part of me saw the value in sobriety, but desire of the high remained stronger.

After 6 weeks of in-patient programming, I “stepped down.” My housing situation changed and I went to a halfway house, mostly for new parolees from prison.  It was a decent spot, I got a room with a cool roommate, and the staff there didn't bother me much.  There were plenty of guys causing trouble there, so I stayed under the radar. Charlie, a friend I'd first met in jail and then through treatment also got a room there, so we hung out a fair amount. After the full schedule of inpatient treatment, all the free time took some getting used to. 

**DRUGS, REVISITED**

Charlie had always made clear his intentions to use again, and now we were in a position to do so. Meth, however, was his choice. He asked if I wanted to get some with him. I agreed.  I was 5 months clean. I sensed the potential to destroy every improvement made so far. But I convinced myself I'd be okay if I avoided heroin. Meth use doesn't cause withdrawal like opiates do. I can handle it. We smoked meth again. We weren't even done with treatment. But we carried on for a few weeks. Luckily I avoided complication and graduated the program. Charlie wasn't so lucky, made to restart entirely as an inpatient after a few days in jail after a failed UA for probation.

I eventually found a job. The pay wasn't much but I didn't hate the job. So now I had a decent amount of cash every two weeks.  I continued using meth. I didn't use heroin for a couple months after resetting my sobriety date, but eventually I did. I was in the same city I had been a user of 6 years. I knew how to get in touch with former friends and associates. In fact I'd sometimes pass them on the street. Even if I fought to avoid the pull of heroin, in these familiar surroundings the possibility and temptation would have won out. 

**HEROIN'S HEROIC RETURN**

I reconnected with all the usual suspects. Told stories of jail and treatment. Caught up on the dope game drama. I remember the sweet reunion of my first shot after so long, getting nauseous like when I was opiate naive. Heroin embracing me in perfection's warm glow. But I was still wary, withdrawal's peril ever present.  For months I kept my habit manageable, infrequent enough and spaced such to avoid dope sickness. But goddamn I love the stuff.

Seldom became frequent. Amounts increased. I'd put myself in the position of withdrawal knowingly, telling myself I'd taper down again and control it again. “This will be the last shot until ___.” “I'll just pick up (some small amount) and make it last until ___.” But my discipline was being eaten away by a wild hunger for more.


**PRESENT DAY**


I've driven myself into the ground. I still have my job, but slow wintertime business means small earnings that only cover rent. I've spent what I'd managed to save. I've sold some possessions to get just one more bag. I had been proud to be able to keep my valuables, but my habit demanded sacrifice.


I've considered methadone, but that would mean admitting to my parents I've been conquered by dope again. I'd break their trust again, just when they're ready to really forgive all I've done. But, it's a guaranteed and legal way to satisfy the brain's itching receptors. So that might be my solution for now.


I'd planned on going back to college, but under these circumstances I'd only fail.


I've been trying to kick, but having the ability to pick up nags at you. I've made it to day 3 several times lately only to succumb.  I had lowered my use enough that those three days were bearable, but the mental yearning is worse than bodily discomfort.


I don't know what to do.  I figured I'd write it down. Thanks if you read any of it.

I'm sure you all know; struggling to stay well day to day so that your life really does revolve around trying to not be sick. I'm lucky enough that I was able to pay all the super essential bills, I made sure of that at least.

You know why it's REALLY frustrating though? Because I know it can be done, I've done it before, for long periods of time. By ""it"" I mean maintain a habit and a life. I just feel like I need a little bit of a head start. Right now I'm staying well on PST day to day but PST sucks right now, it seems like every source has gone to shit and gotten more expensive. But I still pay it because I can't afford to be sick and not able to work. I dabble in dope when I can, but again it's hard to save any money when I have to make sure I'm well every day.

 I'm exploring all avenues, trying to find a way to get subs without insurance, that's the main one right now, but it doesn't look promising SO FAR. 

I'm really just trying to vent, but does anyone know what I'm talking about? Like, if I just had guaranteed work for two weeks straight (I work through a temp agency and it's a craps shoot), or I could pay for a month's script of subs, I could get back on my feet. I remain ever hopeful; if the seeds start getting stronger again this spring I'll be in a lot better of a position. Honestly I shouldn't complain, I have a roof over my head, a car (although I need to register it; another thing that's hard to pay for when I'm just trying to stay well every day).

Sorry if this is disorganized, just want to know I'm not the only one who hates the feeling of always being one step behind. Again, the most frustrating part was when I was working full time I could afford to place large orders of seeds and not just stay well but actually save up - I know it's possible, and I really don't buy the ""if you stay addicted you'll end up dead or in prison or homeless"" thing. I don't think I have all the answers, I just haven't given up on finding SOME of them.",1423294985.0

and you came back to me old friend.

on a scale of 1-10 how bad is the pain?  oh maybe a 6 well 7 at night doc.  cant sleep much...hey is it ok to jog?  i love exercise - no?  bad idea?  physical therapy?  ok.  

2 days later when the bottle was empty and way before the next refill date - You know doc these pills dont work.  should i take more?  i remember as a kid when i broke my arm i got something else...hey thanks for the new prescription doc.  how many refills...?

and it wasnt long before i talked to the barista at Charlie's where i get my morning coffee.  i overheard her on her phone one day as i pretended to study the menu say No more of the 5's!  Got any 7.5 or 10s?  so the next day i brought some of my hydros and let her watch me take 2 pills out, chew them up and swallow.  i looked at her and winked.  she came over with a smile.  

i made her my dealer because she knew people and i had money.  there was both awkward friendship and sex but it was you my friend that bound us together. 

when her connection soured we were heavy into oxy.  she came back with with some shitty h.  it was cheap she said.  i was cold and anxious and it was Tuesday.  why not?

soon she lost her job.  i did too but i got unemployment.  neither of us looked good but neither of us cared because we barely went outside.  our dealer delivered and we had internet.  in my pattern of substance abuse it is when i stop going outside that bad things happen.  

and it did.  it was in May when she left.  she had pinched my bag and it was beyond obvious so i had to say something.  she kicked over the Christmas tree i kept meaning to throw away and walked out during a storm without closing the door.  i saw her 2 months later at her funeral.  

hey remember how we made it ok?  like if we snort we will be ok?  lets promise never to do it again in the arm ok?  ok?  promise me?  though we both promised this time it was my leg so...   

i woke up at Burger King.  i held a whopper about eye level and my hand was shaking.  people were staring but only children dared to speak - Mommy why is that man crying?  was i really crying?  i had no idea where my phone was or my keys when they escorted me out.  it was night and the funeral happened in the morning so the hours that blurred away must have been spent with you old friend.

 Well folks, my finale hour is hear. The dreadful existence of being without in my case is exasperated by the fact that I'm only two weeks removed from losing the only person on this earth who ever loved me, dear old mom. 
We've all been there. That feeling of impending doom when you're looking down the barrel of your last pill or bag or what ever opiate fueled vehicle you travers this otherwise meaningless existence with. Knowing that soon your body will betray you and everything you know and love fades away into the Abyss that lays beyond your tunnel vision of getting better. The long deep nights marinated in sweat and tenderized by the restlessness which somehow have been able to supply a million minutes into a single hour of time. 
I've been consistently high since she left me. Numb to the effect of her non existence. Now my fear of being sick is compounded by the fact that I'll actually have to deal with her death sober. I've cried a billion tears since that first realization of her not being here with me, and I was high then. I can only imagine the water works that will flow once the night comes and that dope sick loneliness creeps upon my wrecked and aching body. Hot and cold will tease my body like a million tiny ants tap dancing on my skin, and I will be left alone to handle a truth that for so long I've self medicated my way to deny. And in that truth I will lie, telling people I have the flu as I have told others that I had a cold when that old faithful heathen first poked his head from my soul looking to be fed while I was at work today. My nose running and eyes watering, damn whether, that was my lie. This is my lie.

I get nice trails and a very smooth smoke, but I noticed when the dot is almost gone I end up with a small lump of residue that doesn't slide, smoke, crush or anything.

The reason I put that in quotes is because I'm not sure if it was really H. It was a small rock that I broke up into a few lines. I snorted more than half of it already, and it really hasn't had any effect on me. 
My nose feels a little numb. Kind of like what happens after a line of coke. The high is very minimal. It feels like I just smoked an L or something, not what I experienced previously on opiates. No nodding at all, It's been about a half hour since I took the last line. I don't feel nauseus or itchy (I normally feel these effects when I did the pills previously). 
The rock that I got itself was white. I expected it to be more of a brownish color.

As prescribed you take one pill every 12 hours.  So the time-release ideally is constant over time.  Of course this can't be done as you still must be adequately under the affect of the analgesic at 11.5 hours.  See these graphs:
> https://www.google.com/search?q=oxycontin+graph&safe=off&tbm=isch

Here are my questions (assuming an 80 mg tablet releases 6 2/3 mg of oxycodone per hour):

* If I took 10 whole 80 mg pills at the same time, would it be equivalent to taking 62.3 mg of oxycodone every hour for 12 hours? (assume I am capable/tolerant of taking a crushed 80 mg pill)

* Is taking two whole 40 mg pills at the same time equivalent to taking one whole 80 mg?

And pregnant.,"I've used poppy pods the past few years, but some months ago, my boyfriend and I decided to try and get pregnant. So I quit. Tapered down over a month or so, and about a month after I had quit completely, I got pregnant. I'm now 10 weeks pregnant, and I've just started using again. Grinding the pods up, and ingesting them. So fucking stupid, I know. I have a chronic muscular dystrophy that gives me daily pains, and a lot of social anxiety, and opiates are the only thing that helps. Pregnancy almost got unbearable, which is why I started using again. My plan is to taper down again at some point, so I won't give birth to a baby with withdrawals. I've read a lot of studies on the subject, and opiates during pregnancy shouldn't pose a risk to the baby, but the whole addiction thing is a mess. I'm not telling my doctors. Still pondering over wether I should tell my boyfriend. I'm so afraid of having done something to hurt the baby.
I guess my intention with this post is to ask if anyone has taken poppy pods or other opiates during pregnancy, without consequenses for the baby? And yes, I know I'm stupid and careless and selfish.

EDIT: I feel I should adress that I am a highly functioning addict - by the time my baby is born, I'll be a doctor. I know how fucked up it is to give birth to an addicted child, and I will quit long before my baby is born to avoid that happening. I'm only 10 weeks in, and if I go through withdrawal now, the chance of miscarriage is much greater than if I wait a month or two. The amount of poppy pods I use is not to get me high, it's to make me tolerate my pain, so that I can walk and take care of med school. The amount of pain I'm in without opiates makes me reconsider my career as a doctor. But I know it doesn't justify doing opiates while pregnant.

First time in doing an opiate in 2 months. i feeling really good and itchy and i wanna talk.

What are u on?

Also dumbest opiate thing you've ever done?

I've only done opiates about a half dozen times besides a month long prescribed opiate stint due to a surgery gone bad.  

Anyways, first night I ever do poppy seed tea (done tea 4 times, morphine once, oxy once and dillys once (only 5 mg barely felt anything), this doesnt of course include oxy and tramadol which was prescribed)

Anyways im getting off topic.  So I make the tea and previous to that i was used to oxy from my surgery which hits within like 40 mins.

Weirdly enough I felt a little buzzed (opiate high) within 10-20 minutes but for an hr it didnt seem to progress at all.  Little did I know it takes PST like 3 hrs to fully hit.

At this point my buddy was planning on getting coke.  I say I'll throw down for some since I was dissapointed with the tea.

We only get a half gram for us two.

i am technically speedballing, and it feels amazing, better than mdma.  i make up in my mind that im not going to ever do it again due to addiction potential (it felt that good).

unlike just coke which id fiend out for in only 15 or so minutes and gave me bad aniexty, and a terrible comedown. on this i could take one tiny line every half hour. no fiending whatsoever.

by the time were done its 4am (buddies great at making his coke last if he wants/needs to)

he goes to bed, im planning on staying up a bit cause i feel fucking great. who cares if the cokes gone.  sitting on couch and bam heart starts beating like crazy, my whole chest is moving.  and then BAM my heart is barely beating i can barely feel it.  sweat is pouring off me like a mad man. there was actually an imprint of sweat, like a huge wet spot after i moved once the worst was over.

finally worst is over, make it to bed. go to lay down and heart once again barely beats. i freak the fuck out and decide to stay awake till im ""ok"" (ended up being 8am.  I was scared if i went to bed i wouldve never woke up/choked on vomit etc.

Any response is greatly appreciated and this sub reddit is helpful, entertaining, knowledgeable/ smart, and seemingly trustworthy so if anyone can help I'd appreciate it!","Some days I feel like I am in a rotation of hurting, getting high, then having that time in-between being high and hurting that stressful mental countdown, to finally hurting again until getting more and repeating this process or move on past the extreme hurting part of withdrawal (in the case of lack of sufficient income).

However, that is not the point of my ""Do You Get This Too..."" post on this sub-reddito....the true rotation that is almost/ equal to the feeling of being uncomfortable that happens with the cycle I had just stated has to do with energy. During the hurting stage I CANNOT sleep at night. My lower back feels like the muscles are pushing on my spine like natural vicegrips and certain flu-like symptoms quickly develop...but then I get some and get high.  Lately I've been getting pure fire $40 bags that normally go for $50 but gave a couple of rides for the dealer and one of his underlings dropped the price for the same size and quality bag to $40 (which it should already be or less)... I should put pictures up of this shit...I'm a little worried it might have fent in it bc of the strength. The size of the bag is one tiny rock..tiny in its truest sense. First time I saw the size of the bag I was convinced it was $5-$10 dollars and i had just got fucked ova and I'm full aware bags priced like that is virtually unheard of but the size of the bag compared to any other 40bag from every other person I've copped off of was easily quadruple the size of this shit. The way I would describe my tolerance so readers can understand the strength of this is: I can (and did last night) blow 4 oxycodone ""30s"" in a line and being completely functional...that being said, I do half a bump..a skinny line the length of  centimeter or less than a quarter of an inch and not only am I not hurting I've caught a very sting buzz/high. This stuff is also pure white, claimed to be uncut from reception said my dealer when he gets it from his boss who get sit from his dealer..meaning that at least 3 rungs on the ladder on the way up the underworld this dope is claimed to not be stepped on, and is odorless and for the most part, tasteless. Now, I deff don't do that much when i cop..its more like double or triple that (always under an inch line no thicker than a coffee stirrer) and I'm rocked....this leads to me to not sleep. Say I cop at 4 pm...I am up until 5 am and towards the morning I might not being completely rocked but I have this huge kick of energy. I get hyper as fuck and I'm even high right now probab;y ranting trying to see if anyone knows what i mean. 

So, with that being said, I go from not sleeping for 3-4 days... at most 3 hours of sleep a night... from hurting to staying up all night a fourth or fifth night or however long I make the stash last because I have too much energy...maybe get a day in between high and hurting where I can sleep, and then back to hurting in a cycle. Yes, I do sleep and keep a full-time construction job and am a full-time student at a state university and have no knowledge of any sleep-deprecation disorder I have always been able to sleep prior to my addiction.

ALSO A MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION THAT I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT....PLEASE ANSWER NOD-BROTHERS: As I have described to you the dope I get....rocky, white, odorless, tasteless, extremely potent...I have a very high tolerance (I only sniff, however...never tried shooting I have no interest in it no matter how much better I hear it is) and that being said a centimeter or less bump (well under a 1/4 inch) can get me high...

He's been in for 10 months and his sentencing date is Tuesday. 

Well, he was transferred back to our state last week and had visiting hours today. I braved a snowstorm to drive the hour to go visit him. Upon arrival at the jail, I was told that he was in the secure holding facility and unable to receive visitors. 

I petitioned the dude on duty and got him to radio the ward to double check, as I had been told by his sister that he was able to have visitors. The dude working was an old guy, balding, paunchy, very nice, with a slight stutter. He acquiesced, although as I had arrived during head count I had to wait about ten minutes. 

I had my fingers crossed in my lap as I waited, and waited, and waited. Finally, the unit returned his call and said that Yes! He was available for visitors! 

I was divested of my hoodie and my jacket; my shoes were poked and prodded to make sure I had no contraband. I set off the metal detector, sincere when I said I had nothing in my pockets and no belt. Of course, it was my underwire bra. How embarrassing to be a female and visiting a jail... 

I was directed down an empty hallway, with no guards and no directions. I had no idea where to go. Passing through two locked doors, I arrived in a large open room. Unsure of where to go from there, I shuffled around aimlessly, expecting at any time to be ushered unceremoniously out of the jail and back into the snowstorm without seeing my friend. 

Anyway. I finally found the right room (they let me wander around without saying anything... does that mean I can break my friend out?) 

I entered this large room with long tables set up, chairs on either side and a plexiglass partition in the middle of the table. Two guards were inside the door; they barked at me to sit. I sat. 

I don't do well with authority. Uniforms confuse and scare me. Every crime that I have ever committed (they are legion) ran through my brain so loudly I was sure the guards could hear. I sat on my side of the table, hopefully peeking out the door to try to see my friend. I listened to the people visiting on either side of me; one man, who looked and sounded mean, berated a woman who I'm sure was his wife or girlfriend about his tax return. I had watched him walk into the room and up to her; he didn't smile once. She had a groveling sort of tone of voice and I felt sorry for her, wanted to take her aside and make sure she was okay....

My friend came into the room and sat in front of me. We only had 45 minutes to talk, because of the delay when I arrived, but it had been about a year since I had seen him and the time flew by. There was a person near me who was visiting another inmate, and a few minutes into our visit he calls out, greeting my friend... Leave it to Jay to know a totally random visitor in a jail an hour away from our town. He knows everyone. He is in jail now with many, many people who he knows. I am glad of this familiarity; it means he's not alone, like he was when he was out of state. 

His sentencing is Tuesday. He explains how his lawyer thinks there is a good chance he will be released after the court date. I am stunned, happy, jubilant, incredulous. Jay is always optimistic, and I am always pessimistic, but he was caught on tape selling drugs to an informant, and pled guilty to distribution charges which can carry up to ten years jail time.... Plus, he has a long laundry list of other convictions, including (but not limited to) assault on a police officer, which they don't take kindly to. 

But I'm hoping that, for once, his optimism will pay off. He has letters from his non-junkie friends attesting to the fact (or presumption) that he wants to stay clean, that he has seen the error of his ways, that he will be good from now on. I am doubtful, but hopeful. I know this man. I have known him since we were 12 years old; I have been his best friend, and sometimes lover, for 20 years. I cross my fingers, I hope like fucking hell he will get out and I can have my only friend back. As much as he has fucked me over in the past, I fucking love this person. 

SO!!! Please please please cross your fucking junkie fingers and hope that he gets out on Tuesday! I need good vibes coming our way... 

Sorry for the length. I drank a bunch of vodka. 

XOXO

I used to have a pretty big habit, but for the past few months I've been chipping quite successfully. I'm blessed to have a wife and people in my life that care enough about me to really research addiction and opiates. In the past I could be high as fuck and nobody would notice, but they've grown wise. It is very rare that I can take an entire night to myself without arousing suspicion. 

Honestly I think it's mostly my pupils that give it away. And also just a ""heroin face"" which looks a little zoned out, muscles loose, even if the eyes are focused.

Anyway I know the obvious fix is ""don't do dope,"" but that's not gonna happen. My life is honestly the best it has been in years. 

Please let me know what you think helps. Coffee? Cold water on the face? Any sort of OTC pills? I've debated just coming home drunk and smelling like booze, but that's not really a good idea. 
Do you guys have any rules you follow? A few times I've been super high, realized I have to see someone later, and I would wait a good 2 hours, but my pupils remain so glaringly pinned. 

The only viable solution it seems is to watch my friends get high while I barely dip into my sack, then do my drugs alone in the dark at like 3 am. Where's the fun in that? I miss the days when being loaded was the normal homeostasis. But hey I'm not complaining about my low tolerance and decent life. I guess I don't have it too bad. Help me out though guys.

In short, I've been on the 50 mcg fentanyl patch for 10 yrs, I recently got my Dr to swap me to the 15 mg IR oxy's. I didn't need the constant 72 hr medication anymore, I really just needed something that worked fast, and I wanted to reduce the amount of opiates I was taking; plus I don't know why, but the fent was killing my immune, I caught every cold that came around me.  So I'm taking about 3 - 4 a day, IF NEEDED. Well, I ended up in ER 6 times since Nov 2014, and finally had a surgery done on 1/16/2014, my mesenteric artery had grown into my stomach and I had a crap load of scar tissue from a exploratory GI surgery I had 10 yrs ago. Well, since each one of those time I went to the ER, the Dr wrote me a pain Rx, which most I couldn't take, because I would vomit up the pills. I had to call my GI Dr. on 12/30 to beg him to refill my normal 15 mg oxy rx, which I don't vomit up, because the pills are small and water soluable. He refilled my Rx, and then he dropped me as a patient, because my insurance filed a complaint against him because of the Rx's the ER dr's wrote? 
Well, now all the sudden every Dr I talk to is directling me to this pain management clinic which when I show up is really a methadone clinic? And the Methadone clinic won't take me, because I don't have ""illegal drug seeking behavior"" or I ""don't fit their addiction model"" 
I am super dependant on opiates now, and I want to continue to go to work, but I simply get too sick for too long to cold turkey.

She's absolutely gorgeous, plays the piano, doesn't use but is so open to things that she is fine with me shooting up right in front of her. She actually finds it interesting but would never use, she said she had tried opiates but her stomach cannot handle them and they make her sick. She prefers her nightly marijuana joint and a cup of earl grey tea.  Still despite my opiate usage she said to me,"" I like you way more than I ever thought I could like someone in such a short amount of time"" She just spent the night with me for the first time last night, we had great sex and I didn't even get the primal male urge to get rid of her right afterwards (guys know what I'm talking about, its a weird feeling that happens quite often immediately after blowing your load). She's amazing and I really believe that when one door closes, an even better one is there to open for you. Its all about how you perceive it.

Around lunch: 8 more V, 3 20mg oxy.

Bed time: 8 more V, 4 mg xanax, and a few bowls of bud.

Im clean from opiates for a month today. I haven't really had any cravings per say but I'd like to start chipping maybe once a month or something like that. I was using around 7mg of Fentanyl IV a day for at least a month and also some heroin before that, at least .5g a day.

I still have very vivid memories, which I think I'll keep for the rest of my life of going cold turkey from 7mgs of fent a day. It was pure hell and that's probably what's keeping the cravings at bay.

Any tips for successful chipping now that I know the consequences of daily use?

I smoke heavily daily as long as I can remember...but have been not toking for 2 weeks so far.

I need to pass a drug screen for a prior authorization fora medication for my shitty insurance. however it is a drug screen where I get my own privacy when pissing in the cup and they don't watch me. This makes it extremely easy to use someone elses pee or something. I am thinking about going 5 days without heroin, however this is an unlikely scenario for me. 

my parents/family members won't give their clean piss, nor do I want to ask them, and for all they know they think I can't pass it due to marijuana. I have zero friends that have clean piss so that's out of the question too (funny how they call it ""clean"" or ""dirty ""piss, all pee is fucking dirty lol)

But anyways I was thinking of getting some synthetic urine and maybe that will work? If anyone knows any good websites that have a 100% success rate would love to know.

Among those was letting my money walk. As I'm sure you all know, the need for dope can lead to irrational descisions like giving your money to a scum bags and just praying they come back... and of course they usually dont. Since those early days I've done my best to never let that happen.

That all changed today, I was sitting in class and got a text saying something along the lines of get the fuck out of class and call me, got a deal of a lifetime. Seeing as I was down to the last of my dope money which wasn't much, don't have any money coming in the near future, my interest was high. Fast forward a few hours, I move some money around, and transfer it to a city 4 hours away and begin to wait.

Of course my guys phone is turned off when I try and get ahold of him, I finally get a hold of him and he tells me he doesn't talk on teh phone when driving and he doesn't know when he will be back. Well fuck. I accepted the fact that I wasn't gonna be getting down anytime soon, went about my night and figured I'd try and sleep.

So today my friend /u/DrugsAndCommunism came down so I could get him some dope. I've middled for him probably 50+ times, and every time he came down, we'd have it anywhere from only 5 mins, to like 1.5hrs TOPS. This time unfortunately, was different...

So he gets to my city around 5:30 and we meet up. I have a bunch of connects, but only a couple local ones. The rest I can only meet if I drive to, and none of us had access to a car, or could find anyone with one that wanted to throw in. My local guy with the fat dubs of fire (ECP) wasn't around, and my more reliable guy with fire ECP (but would just bag up what ever you ask for) unfortunately wasn't around either.

When the latter is at his house, it's always a quick and easy transaction. And even when he's not at his house, he like always brings shit out with him, so if I can drive to wherever he's at, he'll serve me. But as stated above, that was impossible, so we had to wait for him to get back. Luckily, he claimed it wouldn't be long, but couldn't give us an accurate ETA (since he hadn't left yet and was still waiting on his ride).

Unfortunately, I guess my local library was too lazy to shovel and whatnot, so even though normally they'd be open today until 9pm, they were closed. So we ended up waiting in a Dunkin' Donuts up the street, not far from him so when he was ready, we could be there pretty quick. Well we kept getting strung along, and he would claim he's ''on his way back'', even though his ride hadn't showed up and he had no clue when he'd be there to get him. 
-__-

So we literally ended up sitting in that Dunkin's for over 5 hours. Nothing to entertain us or help pass the time except for some conversation, my city's free local newspaper, and eventually, ripping pieces of the newspaper apart to take big letters from a headline or advertisement and spell random words and phrases (/u/drugsandcommunism took a pic of this, so when he's finally home he'll link it).

I had also been talking to a delivery connect who is always pretty reliable, and has great shit, but unfortunately he was feeling too lightheaded/sick to drive all the way to see us. But alas, eventually the guy we waited 5 hours for claims he's actually on the way back now, and should be only 20 mins or so (and I could tell because the background was quiet, unlike a ton of people talking when he was telling us he hadn't left yet, so I could tell he most likely actually did leave).

So we wait like 5 mins before we start walking, as per his instructions, and I actually just left the words created out of ripped newspaper letters (it legit looked like one of those cliche-ass ransom notes like from cartons lmao) on the table. Some of the words were 'weed and IV heroin, fucc bees, Brian's dab cab bitches, shit lol, fuck molly, and art iz gay'. 

So we get to the spot, and after waiting like 7 mins, I legit see him in a car turn down his street (so much for 'already being there' lol). Anyway, he did at least hook it up for the wait. Whenever he says he'll hook it up, he actually does, unlike a lot of dealers. So we finally get it, and start walking back to the Dunkin's we were at so we could use the bathroom. The Dunkin's has a side door right where the bathrooms are, so it's easy to quickly enter via that door and go into the bathroom with up to like 4 other people without being seen by the employees or customers.

For some reason, the side door was locked, so we had to walk in the main front door. No other customers were in there, just employees. (It was like past 11pm by now anyway). But since we had to walk past the counter, and both went in the bathroom, we were only in there like a min or two before an employee knocked on the door sayin 'only one person at a time in the bathroom please'. We woulda just ignored them and stayed, but we didn't want them to like unlock it, and find us prepping shots, and/or call the cops, so we had to leave. 

We walked down the street to another great spot with a bathroom where more than one person can easily get in, but like we figured, by this time it was closed/locked. So we ended up walking like 10 mins away, and luckily the gas station convenience store right near our last resort spot was still barely open, so he got a water bottle. Our last resort spot is actually under a bridge. It's a great spot honestly when it's light out, and there isn't a metric fuckton of snow everywhere. We make it to the enterence to under the bridge, and get absolutely covered in snow by doing so. But at least under the bridge, there were spots that were dry/snowfree for us to sit down and prep our shots. 

My shitty $20 alcatel gophone actually has a great flashlight on it, and the battery was fully charged, so we'd take turns shining the flashlight on each other so we could see us prepping our shots correctly. The water we got was already refrigerated, and it was like 25degrees F outside, so legit as I was mixing my shot, the water started freezing in the bottle cap, and it like froze sorta while in the needle, and couldn't be pushed out. So I used his lighter to warm up the shot in the rig, and he shined the light on my arm so I could hit myself. He actually took a pic of the dope/water solution in the cap starting to freeze, but apparently it doesn't really show to well in the pic (but he'll link it anyway). 

I shine the light on himself for him to hit, and we both luckily hit fine/fast enough. We put everything away, and he tries to burn the cellophane from a cig pack around the opened bag of dope, to increase the chances that none will spill out. But with all the wind it wasn't really working, so he just like double wrapped it tightly. By now, it was like late 11ish/midnight, so the buses stopped by now, and he had to walk all the way back to his dorm like prob at least 2 miles away. But the great thing about dope is that it makes you not feel cold at all, and it makes walking even a ton of miles really not matter much. 

Exiting from under the bridge was a pain, since we couldn't walk back up the way we came due to the snow, so we had to get a ton of snow in our shoes, and walk to a point where we could jump down to lower ground, and leave that way. But luckily it worked fine, and we discussed how crazy the day was, and how waiting 5 hours while both starting to get dopesick really didn't seem that bad in hindsight. We also talked about how this is def an /r/opiates worthy story/post lol. 

It's amazing how no matter all the shit we, or any addict really, can go through just to score, but once we do, pretty much whatever we had to do/go through to make it happen seems worth it for that amazing high lol. Oh and it actually occured to me after we split up and I was walking back to my house... We could have both went in the dunkin's bathroom just long enough to open the bag, and for him to give me my portion, and then he could have left, while I did my shot, then he coulda went in to do his. Irdk why the hell we didn't think of that then, but I guess then this story wouldn't have been as interesting then lmao.

Oh and btw, I didn't wanna include too much info about location, for that's prob against the rules. But let's just say my city is in Mass., in a city like a few miles or so outside of Boston. And his dorm is in a suburb next to my city. But my city is really small, and his suburb is pretty big, so it was def a long distance for him to walk back. Luckily he had the power of being jammed to make it seem not daunting at all haha.

TL;DR: My friend comes down to my city around 5:30, my local connects aren't around but my reliable one claims he'll be back soon. We wait at Dunkin Donuts getting strung along for 5 hours until we can meet him. We finally meet him and go back to Dunkin's to use the bathroom together to shoot, but we're told we can't be in together, so we leave in search of another bathroom. By this time, its mad late, and almost every place is closed. We walk to get a water bottle, then we go to our last resort spot (under a bridge).

Various questions inside.","I'm interested in trying heroin. I've used hydrocodone in the past and enjoyed it, but I'm not sure where to go from here.

I use DNMs to acquire substances, so I have an option on #3 or #4. I am totally into the idea of smoking heroin because it seems like it could be a really chill experience to go out for a smoke rather than cutting up a line, but I've read snorting it is better... So I'm kind of on the fence about the two. Which would be better for a new user, or better yet, could someone give me a brief run down of the differences?

I've also read that DNM potency is a godsend compared to street dope, so how much is a good amount to start with and how frequently?

My brother was/is a massive dope fiend, can I use responsibly or is addiction possibly a genetic thing (lol)?

And I guess the number one question is, should I even be using? I'm a student who tries various substances and stims frequently while doing his work. My girlfriend is okay with soft drugs, but not many hard drugs. I'd pretty much be fucked if people found out I was doing heroin, but I digress.

I fell in with the percs.  They were the only thing that knock down the migraine and kept me awake. I work from home.

My neurologist thinks i need to go on a steroid pack to stop possible rebound cycle. Sadly, I cannot take one of the steroid packs as I have a UTI that my gynecologist can't figure out. Two rounds of antibiotics.

Not to be TMI, but its serious intense bladder spasms.  I am so glad I work from home, I will leave it at that.

I am leaving on a trip 12 feb - 17 feb. I see my gyno tomorrow.  One thing I see used sometimes is B&O which has some opium?  My preference would be to have an opiate, because I may get some relief on my migraines.  My neurologist does not want to prescribe percocet again for TWO MONTHS (24 pills). I have to tough it out. Going to try a new preventative in a week.  She wants to get me on the steroids first but I cant do that until my UTI is figured out.  I guess steroids are bad -- they lower your immune system.

My gyno is pretty good.  She will listen. I read about SO many bladder spasm drugs but also a myriad of tests to do which I wont have time before boarding a plane. I have to drink a TON of water before I fly to try to avoid migraines.  All that water leaves me mortified.

I remember this night vividly. Not just through my eyes and ears, but with all my senses. Like anyone who has had withdrawals from heroin, you know that all of your senses are on over drive. Punishment for their opiated sedation for so long I suppose.

The sweat damped sheet clung to my chest as my head was propped up towards the open window.

The night sky was pitch-black but I could see it was raining lightly because the water droplets were being illuminated as they fell against the orange glow of the streetlight. But the droplets that made it into my room felt good on my face.

I had just lost my job and because of that I was trying to kick, I didn’t have any further income coming in so I wouldn’t have anything to spend on dope. I was at the tail-end of a pretty serious black habit, tallying in at about a g or more a day (IV injected, of course).

So there I lay, in my sorry, dreary room with a mattress in the corner and a small desk on the side. I remember very well that there was this goddamn bug that kept getting just close enough to my ear so it could annoy me with the unnerving high pitch sound of its wings. And it was driving me mad. Frustrated enough in detox, these are the types of things that can easily push you over the edge.

So, as I lay there, wigging out to the tune of an insect, trying to dry my body with my damp and sweat soaked blankets, I finally, finally, give up. It was almost 4am by then.

Immediately, I reach for my phone and pile through my phone list seeing what kind of degenerate would be awake and have drugs for sale at this hour…

Cam? – no

Erik? – Definitley not

Jaque – Shit, I wish

Hmm… Cupcake guy? Huh, maybe give him a call: ringing. No answer. Voicemail.

Fuck! I say, Fuck, fuck, fuck. Frustration and desperation must be best of friends because they both love to fuck with me at time like these.

Wait…

I think in silence for a second, what about Red Rosie! She’s a strung out crack head whore (literally) that I’ve worked with before. She’s middlemanned for me and has been honest thus far. Her real name is Angela, but people call her Red Rosie because of her red hair. There’s a chance she’ll be up at this hour.

(text) Me: hey can you get anything right now?

I kid you not, before I even set my phone back on the bed it buzzes again. 

(text) Red Rosie: sure hun come on down, im at 5th

At this point, my withdrawals subside a little bit know knowing that relief could be near. But I remind myself not to get cocky just yet. After all I am dealing with a crackhead, and the number one rule in dealing with crackheads is that they cannot be trusted. But, to be fair, I have worked with her a few times before and she’s never done me wrong. Either way, I was desperate, what other choice did I have?

By the time I threw on my jacket, got my backpack, gear, and am in the 99’ Tacoma heading into the city its 4:30am. I cross the bay bridge, I take a quick second to notice its beauty in the dark of night, but I gun it and the engine roars because I have more pressing matters.

She wanted me to meet near 5th and Mission, so I find a nice alley way parking spot on 4th and texted Rosie where I was. It was still dark out and the city was still quiet at this point.

About 15 minutes later she appears from a different side alley and heads toward my car. She hops in. I immediately notice her stench, her dirty clothing. She’s probably 35, but she looks 55. I guess you could consider her hair red. The roots were black for about six inches. Apparently it’s been a while since shes had time to color it.

“Hey sweetie, what brings you out here this late?

“Youre the only on up right now,” I replied.

It was clear she was tweaking and seemed more than happy to have company at 4:45 am.

“What are you looking for,” she asked, “I’ve got speed!” She blurted out before I could even answer.

I just ignored that, cringing at the thought of using speed in my current condition. At this point I wasn’t sure if I wanted benzo’s to continue to help with the kick, or just fuck it all, pick up some heroin, get some sleep, and kick another day.

“Ya got any black?""

“Yeah I can get black she says with a sly smile, I can always get black. But, first we gotta go pick up my boy Romy, drop him of at the trap house. He’ll take our money for us and then he be—

…STOP. Just, stop. Do you have black on you or not?

She shakes her head.

“No way I’m doing that,” I say to her, “too many moving parts, to many chances to get ripped off, too much fucking time. What about benzos, can you get benzos?

“Yeah Honey! I can get benzos. I got some up in the apartment I just came down from, I just need to go get them. How many you want?”

After we negotiated the finer details, I was going to get 10 bars for 60 dollars. Not a great deal, not a bad deal, but it being almost 5 am I could live with it. Besides, I only needed them for a couple more days of kicking. I didn’t like the idea of letting my money walk but at this point I was desperate and had no choice. She took the money and said she’ll be back in 2 minutes.

…

(25 mins) me: ???

(45 mins) me: hey you almost done?

(47 mins) Rosie:  yes about to leave

(47 mins) me: ok good

(1:20) me: what the hell, you coming or what

(1:23) Rosie: sorry this dudes trippin ill be doen in a second

(1:40) me: wtf

(2:00) me: if you fucking ripped me ooff I swear to god im gonna spend all fucking day looking for you

(2:20) not ripping you off sorry just hold on

Call: no answer

Call: no answer

Call: no answer

Call: no answer

I waited my sorry as over 3 hours till the sun came up for that fucking red-headed skank that I knew I shouldn’t have trusted in the first place. FUCK. At this point I’m sweating buckets, got the chills goose bumps, restless legs, sicker than ever and now $60 lighter. I’ve been ripped off before but there was something about the circumstances this time that just made me really felt like I wasn’t going to stand for it. Whether I did or not, I felt like I had nothing to lose. I decided right then and there I wasn’t going let her get away with it.

The morning sun had started to warm the street, but it was still cold as hell. Steam rose from the manhole covers and the homeless began waking and picking up their makeshift tents before the police came by to fuck with them. I zipped up my jacket tight and stepped out in the bad part of the mission district, only the second most vile and dangerous ghetto in San Francisco.

I had an inkling that my day was only beginning.

I have a huge problem with finding a vein on my left arm.  I've never been able to IV in this arm,  however it's the one that has a nice vein that can be felt.  Phlebotomist's generally use my left arm too because they can also feel the vein.

&nbsp;

Here's the problem, because I can't find the vein on my left arm (inside of elbow), my right arm in the same place is the ONLY place I can hit without poking several times.  I know it's not good to hit the same place over and over again, but I'm not sure what to do.  Yesterday, I fished my left arm a good 30 times and could not hit that vein.  I tried registering before the needle was all the way in and I tried leaving the needle in and gently moving it around to ""fish"" for the vein.  When that didn't work, I tried a hot shower, exercized and then used tried a warm compress before attempting again - BIG NOTHING.  I also drink a ton of water prior to attempting.

&nbsp;

Anytime I have had blood drawn or an IV placed, I have been told my veins are deep and there have been times where the phlebotomist/LPN has had to grab an experienced RN to draw blood or place and IV. A few times, I have had to have IV's in my hand or wrist due to medical professionals not being able to find a vein. This is not from IV useage as I am fairly new to this ROA for heroin and have not had blood drawn/or IV placed since I started shooting up.

Relevant info: I do tie off, use 29 1/2g needles and it's ECP if that matters. Also, there is no one that can show me how as my habbit is a private one.

* if you don't have kids yet or you do but haven't gone through this yet with them .. will you be honest/tell them about your use? if so, what age do you think you will tell them about it and to what extent? if not, why not? do you think it would be beneficial or detrimental for them to know about mom or dad's past drug use/addiction?

* if you already have kids and have addressed this situation already, tell us how it went and what you decided to do/tell them (or not tell them).

* were/are your parent(s) addicts? were they open and honest with you or did they try to hide it? have you ever gotten high with your parent(s)?

I hope this goes well! if you have any ideas for questions, def message me and of course I'll give you credit.

after it has been underway for a lil while, I would like to have contests and the best or most upvoted comment/story would win a prize from me. (nothing illegal or anything that would put our community in jeopardy, just a gift card or something cool.) I feel like it could be really fun and interesting.

I realize I sound kinda dorky in this but I am excited about it .. I don't get high anymore, all I do is work so it is the lil things like this project that make me very happy! I hope you guys enjoy it also. love you all ❤",1423584958.0

Now sometimes I would drink or take MDMA or adderall and once coke. 

Since I got on subs I've gotten a job, earned the trust of my family, my girlfriend and the few friends that were willing to forgive me. Overall my life has been good. But here comes the bad part.

I got a connect for xanax bars and I've been taking benzedrex too and it's getting out of control. My life is back to normal and now I'm back to destroying it. My family seems to know I've been using and it kills me inside but normal life is just awful. 

Working 5 days a week till I'm old as shit just seems awful. The lives we lead just seem to be work, try to have ""fun"" , sleep, then work. And then your dead. How is this what  humans were ment to do. Life without drugs just isn't for me, yet it's destroying my life. I would be doing heroin but I have no connect and don't like getting ripped off on the west side so I'm stuck with my benzos. Stims and alcohol till I lose my job and go back to the pocket of hell I crawled out from. 

I guess I was meant for this. For euphoria to be more important then life itself. Thank you for this subreddit. Knowing there's other people like me out there in the world does help me. Good luck to you all in recovery. I can't do it anymore, at least now right now. 

TL;dr can't stand being sober anymore so there goes my good normal life and here comes some cocktails till I can find some better stuff.

Edit: thanks for the advise, jokes, sarcasm and all that other good stuff. I'm going to do my best and hope for the best. Love you fags",1423584575.0

whether you're an addict or not, holidays and birthdays often come with an air of expectation. for example, even if you're not really into birthdays or designated ""special days"" on the calendar, you may feel like you need to stock up on supplies prior to those days so you make *sure* you have something.

while it sucks to be sick and dry whether it's christmas or just a random tuesday, I feel like it sucks a little more when it's the former and everyone around you is buzzing around and all you can do is keep blowing up your dealer's phone. even worse, when you have no money on a holiday! the banks aren't open, most of the resources and places one would have at their disposal to try to hustle up money with aren't available .. shit sucks.

>what was your worst or best holiday or birthday? any stories about being late to thanksgiving dinner because your dopeman was running late? or being broke or nodding out in your bday candles and causing mad family drama? or even being alone on a holiday and how it felt.

**AND/OR**

>what do you hope to accomplish by your next birthday? (if your bday is like, tomorrow or next week, then next NEXT birthday lmao) a lot can happen in a year. do you want to be clean by that time? or a better chipper? or a college graduate? or more money in the bank, a better job? just happier?

thanks everyone for participating. I was kinda scared last time because no one replied in the first hour. but you guys posted some awesome stories and thoughts. :) maybe I am kinda doing this for selfish reasons .. I LOVE reading everybody's stories. but I also can't wait to do the contest things I was talking about. maybe after the first 5 or 10 questions, I will introduce my first contest question.

even besides these questions threads, I have noticed a lot of amazing story threads lately, namely from This_is_a_rubbery, FashionablyFake and morbo2000 ❤ keep writing guys. even if you're not big into writing, try it out and when you feel comfortable, share the results with us. it's very cathartic and stress relieving, I promise",1423756136.0

If this is the case, then snorting oxycodone in pill form, would actually have a BA more approaching the oral BA, and that a small portion which is not absorbed is excreted via the GI tract (aka feces). Of course the pharmacokinetics of intranasal oxycodone would then look rather interesting then - a small burst from the quickly IN-absorbed oxycodone followed by the slow increase from the GI-absorbed portion. But ultimately the total BA ends up being as good or even better than the oral BA (assuming you don't blow your nose). Anybody else thought about this before?

This is something I've been really asking myself for the past year. I guess I should start with a little background about myself, since I've never shared personal details about my life with this sub. This isn't a drug story; although I've had my share of crazy moments, I know people have wilder stories.

I come from a middle-class home. My parents worked a lot and tried their best to instill positive values to my sister and myself. I also was labeled as ""gifted"" at an early age. In school, I was one of the smart kids, the type who could goof off in class yet still manage to pull an A or B out of my ass if I was half-inclined. The type of kid that teachers would always say, ""FuckYouAndYourBike, you have so much talent and potential if only you applied yourself."" I'm sure you get the idea, probably many of you were this same kid too. I've noticed, it's generally intelligent kids that get into drugs out of curiosity, because curiosity cannot exist without intellect driving it.

And my teachers were right. Although I'm brighter than the average person, I had and currently have, very little self-discipline. And I notice, just about every other addict lacks this trait too. And you know what? I hate myself sometimes for this, although I don't feel sorry for myself. I'm probably older than the average age of this sub and because I've never developed self-discipline, I have less than people a decade younger than me. And I'm not just talking about materialistic things. Whereas I've had ""experiences"" with drugs, my peers have been able to go and explore the world, make lasting relationships, and develop passions and interests; things I haven't thought about in forever, except maybe in my drug-fueled fantasies. I know in my heart, my only true passion is finding and consuming drugs. So sometimes I start to despise these people with their Bed Bath &amp; Beyond lives.. and then I'll realize it's just because I despise myself.

From my youngest age, I can look back and recall addictive tendencies I had such as hoarding candy or obsessing with money. I guess being ""gifted,"" I learned at an age earlier than most people, how to reward myself with dat sweet dopamine rush, even though I had no clue what this even was yet. So from candy and money came the natural addictive exploration and progression to weed, alcohol, mushrooms, LSD, ecstasy, coke, pills, and now to the grand finale of heroin and crack.

So here I am now. On day 4 of a self-imposed WD. At least now that I'm older, I've learned (the hard way) what's sustainable for me if I'm going to use. But I'm looking back, and I'm realizing that over half my life I have been addicted to drugs. I sometimes wonder if I haven't permanently fucked up my brain to the point where I will no longer feel true happiness without drugs. That's actually a sad thought to me. My last detox, I was clean for 9 months (by far the longest I've been clean in a decade). And the whole time it felt like I was a shell of my former self (even after PAWS), like I was sleepwalking through life; No real joy, no real emotions. Ironic because when I'm high, I'm really just sleepwalking through life as well.

But I know people can change. It's rare but I've read about people doing it, heard about people doing it, and have seen it myself. I truly admire these people that manage to overcome their past and transition into something new, because I can only guess the amount of fortitude it must take; I've tried and failed over and over to accomplish this.

So I think I'm at a tipping point in my life. Like a see-saw perfectly balanced, I could step on either side. But sometime soon, I want to decide on this forever: Stay high until I die or start something new. Both have their own trials and tribulations, and to be honest, I could go either way.

So where are you at in life, and your point in addiction? Do you plan to keep using forever?

And Donna said, ""yeah, dude, she's cool,"" and grubby said, ""should we check her?"" Donna just said to check my arms, hah hah. Stupid fucking kid, I felt like laughing at him or hitting him but I didn't think either choice would do much for the prospect of getting high, which isn't looking too good anyway. 

So nothing happened with the dope but somehow we ended up with 15 hits of acid. I just dropped one to sample it and it hasn't hit me yet. 

TWEAK. So I dropped a hit of acid last night and at first I thought it was pretty weak, but it was just a very slow to come on high that was actually very good. I think I laid on my bed all night, listened to portishead and played with my candle. I just thought it would be okay to go out for cigarettes and coffee but I probably should have stayed inside. 

I sketched along the sidewalk like yet another crackhead who doesn't know what the fuck they're doing. Somehow managed to grunt ""Marlboro reds"" to the cashier and ask for matches, too. What a joke.... 

I did have visuals but I can't say if they were good or not. Had brief notions of ""maybe I shouldn't pollute my body with drugs"" but then dismissed them because LIFE JUST WOULDNT BE AS BEARABLE. 

 I haven't slept all night, which means neither has Luna, who is even now trying to leap onto my pen. Poor Luna. Look, I even made my goddamn cat a crackhead.

A friend of mine drives an Infiniti, and I offered my services in exchange for a small fee. On Tuesday night he gave me $25 for some easy work, and Monday night was the last night I had any 30s. Wednesday is my day off, and I get paid Thursday night, so I knew I only had two work days and one relaxing, carefree off day to do nothing at all before I could get more. I'm used to this by now, but I still always keep my eyes open for any opportunity to make some extra side cash on those days I know I'll be out. So, now that that's out of the way, let's get to the JJ. So of course $25 isn't enough to get anything - the least amount I can buy at a time is two, and they're $30 each, because that's just the way my connects are. But I figured whatever, I can use it on some gas and cigarettes and whatnot, make the off days a little easier until the big Thursday score. Tonight I went to the gas station to acquire the aforementioned goods, and also bought a $5 scratch off. Junkie Jesus mounted his golden steed and leapt into action, and wouldn't you know it I won $50. I had $9 left over from my gas station purchases, putting me $1 short of being able to score. Lucky for me, I have about $4 in quarters in my car. And just like that, my day went from a relaxing but dry 'waiting day' to a 'fuck yes let's fucking go motherfuckers' night. And tomorrow morning I'll have another friendly blue face greeting me when I wake up, followed by a pay day score after work. Thanks, Junkie Jesus.

Tl;dr - won $50 off a scratch off. Had enough to score early. Fuck yeah!

I stride with pace across the crosswalk in the opening between two buildings and, no longer protected by the brick façade, the chilly wind is able to hit me with its full fury. I find myself appreciative of the fact that I brought along my heavy North Face jacket.

My pace was quick. I was determined. I was going to find Rosie and make this right. I wasn't sure even exactly what I was going to do if I did find her. If I did manage to find her the cash would undoubtedly already be gone. I’m not much of a fighter either and I wasn't about to beat this woman (although I have to admit I sure as hell was fantasizing about it). I guess I’d just scare her somehow, and if I was lucky get some of the drugs or money back. I supposed I’d just figure out those details if the time came. Truly, I was just pissed off, hurting, and needed to take out my anger somehow. 
Typical flawless plan of an frantic drug addict, right?

Anyway, I knew her main spots and streets. I made a quick few rounds from 3rd to 8th, following Mission and coming back alongside Market, sometimes zig-zaging in between. It kind of started to dawn on me how hopeless of an operation this was. Furthermore, I was almost desperate enough at that point to spend my remaining money in the god-forsaken Tenderloin, AKA the “TL”. The TL is one disgusting cesspool of human pain, suffering, and excrement. 

Sadly enough, I knew it would be a waste though; the dope was trash there and wouldn't even touch my too high of a tolerance.

For my last attempt before I gave up, I headed to an old but operational building called The Henry Hotel. I knew she had friends in the building, and who knows? …I might just get lucky.

Before I continue, it is imperative that you know what an SRO is. They are essentially dorm rooms for drug addicts, drug dealers, prostitutes, and others down on their luck. To even call it a hotel is a stretch. Basically they’re these run down 7-10 story buildings with rooms you can rent by the hour, day, or week. Most of them are just trashed to the point of being derelict; all likely infested with cockroaches and worse yet, infested with the people that reside within. The Henry Hotel was a SRO.

It starts drizzling again as I make my way to the hotel. I notice now that I've been walking around a bit, I’m actually starting to feel a little bit better; although every time that thought crossed my mind, I’d be reprimanded by the detox gods with a chill up my spine or an nauseating hot flash. There’s absolutely no getting away from it, it seeps deep into your bones and is utterly relentless. 

I stand before the hotel and take a deep breath. It’s still a few minutes until 9am, which is when visiting hours start. I pass the seconds by looking up and down the street for one last chance to glance Rosie. But, alas, no such luck.

The inside atrium of the Henry Hotel was as dirty as could be expected. Although, it wouldn’t have been half bad had they only spent some time with the vacuuming or throwing some fresh paint of the stained walls. 

The man at the front desk stood behind a barred wall of re-enforced steel, with a little talking opening like the ones you see at the movie theater. It was an Indian fellow with his arms crossed talking with his buddy a few feet beside him.

“Excuse me,” I said, “I’m visiting a friend, can I go in?” There was a steel door blocking the entrance to the first floor and the only way to get through was if he buzzed you in.

“ID,” he said.

I hate leaving my ID up front but these SRO’s get so much trouble that it’s a common policy to have to leave your ID at the front desk during your stay, maybe so the cops will know who was there if something goes down? I don’t know, and I don’t care, whatever, I give him my drivers license.

To my surprise he asks me what room I’m visiting. I clearly wasn't ready for this question; I figured I’d just throw out a random room number. Only, I didn't know if the rooms were ordered by number, letters, or even in what increments for that matter. By the look of his stoic and serious face, I highly doubted he was going to let me in if I didn't give him an acceptable answer.

I racked my brain quickly

“C-34,” I stuttered. 

He looked at me for a second longer, then reached down and pressed a button below the desk. The gate in front of me gave an audible, “buzz” sounds and I was able to swing it open. 

“Whew,” I mumbled to myself as I rolled my eyes. C-34 was a room from a different SRO in the Tenderloin that I had bought drugs out of a few weeks ago. That gem of a building was called the Fairfax Hotel. Anyway, I was surprised and relived I still remembered it.

Now, at this point I didn't really have a game plan besides “look for Rosie,” and I had no idea how I was going to do that. Honestly, I think I was so stupid and strung out at this point in my life that there weren't a lot of good reasons, or reasons at all, for the things I did. Looking back, it’s hard to decipher my rationale for doing all the things I did. Most of the time, I just remember that they happened.

So, without so much as a half-ass plan, I started making my way down the hallways, listening as closely as I could for Rosie’s high-pitched, croaky voice. After a few floors I realized just how stupid this plan was, and decided to put my desperation born confidence to use.

Now, If I heard any movement or voices within a room, I would lightly knock--trying my best to avoid a “police knock.” About half the people whose doors I knocked on would scope me through the peep hole then actually open the door.

I would greet them and simply ask something along the lines of “How’s it going, is John back yet?” as nonchalantly as possible. Of course, John was made up, a made up reason for me to knock on the door. 

Their responses were generally all the same. “Wrong room.” coupled with a door slam. Each time I’d try my best to get a peek inside. The rooms are small and I would have seen Rosie had she been in one of the rooms that opened up. After about 10 rooms or so I got into a conversation with a woman who figured I was looking for drugs. My ears perked up. 

Technically, she wasn't wrong, as a junkie I was always looking for drugs. It’s a lifestyle, there’s no such thing as NOT looking for drugs. It’s internal radar that is always on and can’t be turned off.

“I can get you a hell of a lot better deal than John sweetheart, I know that fool and he gets it from the TL and then still steps on it himself. I don’t mess with that shit, uh huh. I've got this fire chiva and I’m about to go make my morning run.”

She was a hunched over, older looking black lady with nappy hair covered by a do-rag. She looked harmless, so I asked for her phone number. Unfortunately, she didn't have one so I typed her room number into my phone instead and made plans to meet up with her later.

Around that point I could feel the futility of looking for Rosie rising, and sort of switched my main purpose of being there of looking for drugs. My friends have told me that there’s some good dope that was known to come out of the Henry Hotel. 

Before I knew it I was at the last floor.

I take a long sigh and curse myself. “What the fuck am I doing?” I’m ready to give up. And at that precise moment I noticed some noise from the very end of the hallway. I cautiously make my way down and notice that the last door in the hallway is slightly ajar.

“Hmmm…what could this be?” I mumbled under my breath. Something was pushing me to find out.

I slowly peak my head around the corner to get glimpse of the room. I see one person, a young black kid, mid twenties or so, probably about my age. He was tall and lean and had short dreads; Baggy jeans and shirt with a nice looking watch. From what I saw, he was stuffing some clothes into a black back pack.

My junkie vision also locked in on the many orange and clear syringe caps strewn about the room. I smiled slightly with relief thinking I may have found exactly what I was looking for. 

I don’t remember exactly what happened after that because I was freaking out so hard I was kind of just frozen. But, when the kid eventually saw me I was half way through my sentence of “Hey man, you know where I can get anything around here?”

Apparently that was the wrong thing to say.

He started cussing me out, getting in my face, shouting and asking how I found his room. He kept asking and yelling, “Nigga who told you where I live? Who the fuck told you where I live?”

But, fuck me if I was going to let a little yelling ruin my potential for scoring dope. Nothing stands in the way of junkie desperation-confidence. He finally calmed down a little bit when I was able to convince him that I was just a sick fiend and looking for someone and found his room by accident.

I told him I noticed his gear on the desk and told him again I’m detoxing and have cash, and that if possible, would love to buy something off him.

Part begging, logic, and pity, I eventually got him to consider helping me out. I could see it in his expression that he was at least considering it. 

“What you even lookin for?” He said with his chin up. 

That’s when I knew I was home free. 

“Just some chiva,” I replied quickly.

For my next argument, I pull up my sleeves and show him my junkie ID card. And after seeing my track marks his demeanor changed almost instantly.

“Shit nigga cover that shit up before the cameras see it.” He said in an almost friendly voice. 

Out of all the things that go on at the Henry Hotel I’m still not quite sure why he was afraid of the cameras seeing my track marks, but hell, I didn't question it. And that wasn't the first time my tracks have gained me access to the trust of a dealer. He waved me into his room, and I obliged immediately. 

“Dude, you’re a life saver, I’m so glad I came across you. By the way my name is Lucas.” I said as I stuck out my hand.

And that, in my unbridled carelessness, uninhibited stupidity, and clusterfuck montage of bad decisions, was how I met the man they call, “Skeet.”

Started with pills, moved on to dope, you know how it goes. I've been making excuses as to why I can continue using and live life normally but it's coming to the point where I really can't. My tolerance is too high and I currently don't make enough money to support my habit, pay the bills and do other things I enjoy. I currently do about .3-.5 of BTH a day. I can make .5 last 2 and a half days if needed. The stuff I get is pretty good. Half the time I get raw, the other half I get my dealers ""cooked"" stuff that isn't that cut(I've made it with him). 

Anyway, it's time for me to stop. Or take a very long break. But I don't eve know where to start? I know I can quit cold turkey, I've done it before. However, I currently can't afford to take 3 days out of my life to go through w/ds. I work and I have class. The only days I have free are saturday and Sunday, and I can't be sick one bit for work. 

I don't have health insurance(I plan on signing up soon though). I wouldn't mind going on methadone or suboxone, but right now the only doctor I can go to is the university doc and idk if that would be a good idea.

I live in Las Vegas(sorry about posting location but I'm not sourcing. This is essential information because this kinda stuff varies city by city, IE LV has no needle exchange but many other cities do). Does anyone know of any free addiction clinics or anything? Again, I can't take days off to go to rehab. I would just need some stuff to get me through w/ds, I wouldn't mind going to addiction classes or whatever at night.

So anyone that's been through a similar situation(needing to get off opiates but not being able to go cold turkey or rehab) do you have any advice? Or anyone that has a good idea as to what I should do, please, let me know. Thank you. ",1423694216.0

While high on oxy so I wasn't sure if I actually meant it. 

I had a bad day at work. I have a senior level job and I got in trouble for not being at my desk for 8 hours a day. Which upset me and made me want a new job. Which means I would have to pass a drug test. Honestly. I know other bad things happened today where I thought. I should have never gotten out of bed. but now they don't even seem relevant. But my life was 'so bad' in my mind. 

Until I heard my friend (let's call him matt) overdosed and dies this after. While I was at work complaining that my boss yelled at me. I feel like the most selfish person ever. But it gets worse 

In September of 2011 a man very close to me and my then boyfriend (let's call him bob) overdosed and passed away. He was with Matt and Matts girlfriend at the time. Before matt called 911 he took all of bobs drugs and left the house to save his and his gfs  ass. If he would have called right away maybe Bob would have lived. 

Matt showed up to the viewing and I was so angry with him like he caused it. And I know he didn't but I needed to be angry and I said to him among other awful things I hope someone does this to you when you overdose. It honestly could have been the meanest thing I've ever said to someone. 

Matt was a guy that my then boyfriend considered his best friend. He was a  great dude that made a mistake. A few months later he wrote me a letter. The only part I really remember was 'I lost everyone that mattered to me. So my only option is to save myself' I was happy for him. I never forgave him entirely but I can't be his judge. 

I've seen him several times since then and our friends said he was doing better and I was happy for him like maybe this didn't all happen in vain. Well 6 months ago he met thus girl in NA and he was determined to help her overcome the same struggles. But instead she pulled him down with her. 

Today matt overdosed while he was with his girlfriend no one saved him. And I never wanted that to actually happen. And I feel so guilty just because I said that. But even way more of a terrible person because my day was horrible because I didn't sit at my desk all day. And I deserve to feel like this or have anyone save me.

Here's ""The Dead Flag Blues""","Here's my short story, which I was considering expanding into a novel. It's loosely based on [The Dead Flag Blues by Godspeed You! Black Emperor](http://youtu.be/XVekJTmtwqM); you should listen to that song while reading this, as it perfectly sets the mood.



**The Dead Flag Blues**  

*“The car is on fire, and there’s no driver at the wheel.”*  


The fires had finally burned out.  


  Looking down on the peninsula from San Bruno Mountain, the scene looked like the pictures Adam had seen of the city after the 1908 earthquake.  As then, the city burnt.  But this time, there was nearly nothing left to rebuild from.  Between the bay and the mount he stood upon, there stood no wall; no structure.  


  One single tear rolled down Adam’s face before he wiped it away and admonished himself for losing hydration.  The last couple weeks (Or was it three? He couldn’t be sure) had changed him.  Not just his outward personality; no, it changed the way he looked at and lived in this world.  Every meal was a blessing, and every drop of water was sacred.  


  The amount of weight he lost was shocking.  Food was hard to come by, as any and all stores of any kind had been looted right at the beginning.  Bottles of water were rare, and any other source was contaminated.  He would kill and eat just about any animal he saw, and even that was rare.  Not to mention, any fruit-bearing trees or bushes had long since been picked clean. He was, quite literally, starving to death.  


  He used to have hope.  Hope that things would get better, hope that help would come.  Hope that his family was alive.  


  Hope that he would survive.  


  However, just like seemingly everything else, his hope had died as well.  After the blast, the survivors from San Francisco tried to evacuate to, well, anywhere.  Word quickly came that there were more cities hit: Oakland, Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento.  The Edmonston Pumping station, among a few other pumping stations along the California State Water Project, was also destroyed, crippling water flow to Los Angeles.  Word of mouth reports whispered of foreign soldiers landing in the south, though of what nation was never agreed upon.  Some feared China, some feared North Korea.  Further bolstering these claims was the complete lack of federal aid; it seemed all resources had been routed to southern California.  


  Most of this was in the back of most people’s minds, however.  Death demanded the focus of most.  There were newly blind people, and people with their skin seemingly melting off.  People with terrible, malicious sunburn-like wounds honestly got off lucky.  Adam had been riding his bike around Forest Hill, and the shockwave had knocked him off his bike and given him these sunburns; he considered himself fortunate.  


  Or at least, he and others who survived the initial blast thought they were fortunate. That is, until the sickness began to set in. For some, it happened quickly; after early bouts of nausea, diarrhea, severe headaches, and fever.  This was followed by hair loss, horrifying rashes, and blood loss from seemingly random places. The first death was around two weeks after the explosion, with more following.  


  In Adam’s eyes, he was doomed to die.  He may not have any physical injuries, but he was caught by fallout.  He felt all of the early symptoms.  It was even hard to think sometimes, and his hand-eye coordination seemed off.  There were others who were worse, yes, but that did not mean he was to survive.  


  That’s why he climbed to the top of this mountain: to die.  He may not have told himself that, but somewhere inside, he knew it was why.  Consciously, he told himself it was to see the city for himself; maybe it wasn’t as bad as they said. Maybe, down there where once stood a mighty, beautiful city, maybe there was a glimmer of hope.  He didn’t even know what that might be:  an encampment of survivors, or maybe FEMA or the National Guard.  


  Yet all he saw was his whole life destroyed.  It was all just rubble around a crater.  A crater right about where city hall once stood.  AT&T Park, where he spent many a day watching baseball: gone. Flattened were the streets of Chinatown, where you could find all sorts of cheap knick-knacks.  His house in Pacific Heights was most likely gone, too.  And in this instant, this moment where his whole destroyed life was laid before him, he decided to die. And to do so on his own terms.  


  And so, he sat down, took off his backpack, and pulled out a small bottle and a syringe.  He had participated in the looting shortly after the bomb went off, and he had snagged this, among other things: a bottle of Numorphan, otherwise known as Oxymorphone.  He had originally thought of trying to sell it, as he was never one for narcotics.  However, money meant nothing now, and nobody was willing to part with food or water for drugs.  At least, nobody with food and water was.  


  Now, however, he had a use for it. He calmly filled the syringe with what he thought was a lethal dose and, using one of his shoelaces, tied off his arm. He had never done this, so he was going off of doctor’s visits and movie depictions.  After slapping his arm a couple times, he found a vein, and tried to insert the needle.  He found it akin to stabbing a cooked spaghetti noodle with a sewing needle; he laughed to himself at the thought, despite the pain.  


  Finally, after nearly a half hour of trying and him nearly giving up, he hit the vein, pulled a small plume of blood into the syringe, and pushed the plunger.  A second of bliss, and then: darkness.",1423791129.0

Every once in a while there is a day that I just can't get through-- a day where my smiles are always faked and my personality is shallow and I feel hollow. 

Today is one of those days. 

And I sit here waiting for something to hit me, some stroke of genius but I haven't written anything in forever that's worth reading. I guess that's what you get when your real life is temporarily on hold and nothing interests you-- not even dreaming. And you look in every direction and there's nothing there that you connect with, you return to the places you've been and you feel like a stranger and you try and you try and you try but you cannot come up with a place where you've ever been completely happy, but staying in the place where you're at is wearing and tearing at your nerves but what can you do? 

So you do the one thing you know how to do well, which is hiding inside of yourself and not letting anyone near, except this backfires as soon as you WANT to open yourself up and can't because you've pumped yourself so full of drugs that your emotions have shriveled, along with your confidence, and you're fucked. 

So. 

Grow up and stop doing dope, 'cos they're on to you anyway and your arms hurt and you wanted a car, remember? To fly out of this trap in. Just swallow what's left of your pride and endure, endure, endure. You'll find a place to dream in soon enough. 

And besides, it's not the place, it's you. And if you want something badly enough, it'll happen, right? Right. I've been doing dope all night and my cigarette tastes so sweet and I want to sleep next to someone tonight, I miss it so badly... I've got bloodstains on my shirt and I'm gonna have bruises tomorrow but oh well (was it worth it?). Stop. You can't live in this little self-containment much longer. You're making yourself dull and depressed. 

Though right now inexplicably you're feeling pretty good. Remember rooftops with demons below toting flashlights, but they were only demons so continue mixing up the shots, there's nothing to worry about. Remember Oogle Tony's squat and running, hiding from some sadistic junkie-- a scene out of a movie, I swear to god-- my boyfriend picking up a metal rod in the dark and dusty room that we were hiding in, tiptoeing over to the door, me backed into a corner not breathing for fear it was the cops or the psycho who was going to kill us. Remember Sammy and his delusions and running through alleyways trying to get away from ""Them"". Remember Dana and my excursion off Capitol Hill to the Harley store and the knife store in the market, trying on leather jackets, high as a kite and so happy. 

Remembering Dizzy's popsicles and House's twizzlers and Skinny's jellybeans and Kristin's yellow robot and Stray's broken elbow dripping blood on the orange chair we found on the sidewalk. Remembering the couch in Neighbor's Alley and my boy and I sleeping on it in the dead of winter with nothing but each other to keep us warm. 

Remembering the Harvard House bathroom, where found warmth and shot dope in the middle of a blizzard. Remembering the Value Village dumpster and Burger King bathrooms and gravelly rooftops and the park and the basement in my old building. Remembering scams at Nordstroms and ounces of tar in diapers. Remembering Dizzy reading us to sleep and the Gutter Days and Callahan nodding on the carpet and Skinhead Pat drooling on himself and Robert's cynicism and obnoxious Gretchen and her ghetto cat and faggy Richard doing speed and eating M&Ms in his apartment. Remembering Skinny tweaking on the bathroom floor and Skinhead Pat with a needle in his forehead. Remembering the Space Syringe. 

I miss you.  

TL;DR: Don't worry. I wouldn't have, either.

And the fucked up thing about it, is that society prefers drunks over addicts so if you do drink too much, people usually think you're lower than dirt. I don't know, like I really hate alcohol but drinking feels good, it's everywhere, and it's socially acceptable. I can get wasted and my uptight family doesn't judge me for it.

I get a script of dillies  every two weeks and they last about half that no matter what I try. I then find myself in my shower shaking, hot, cold, every muscle aching. This is when I tell myself NEXT TIME this won't happen, I'll have self control and take the right amount but bang it. That never happens. So I got my script today and had 1 janky ass spike left and used it twice. Now I have to insuffulate until Monday when my 100ct box comes. So I'm hoping that will atlas help out a bit, and relive old memories of snorting these 8mg at a time after my last surgery 5years ago. I'm allowed to take four a day, and I'm right on track now. 

It's usually night time when my stash mysteriously gets smaller and smaller and smaller. I feel like I'm sleeping hard, waking up and doing a brake the shakes shot, and then one when I actually wake up. I guess I wake up and do this every 30 min as that would be the only way for it to go as fast as it does haha. I'm trying to come up with other ways to slow my roll as not ordering spikes on time for the month isn't a fireproof method.

So what else do yall do? I mean withdrawals aren't that bad anymore for me. After doing it every other week for a while now, I think my body has become numb to it. I literally have one night of sweaty gross non sleep, followed by a day of extreme lethargy, head aches etc..however I have found with 10-15mg of lope, some music, and the outdoors get me straight pretty quick. It is hard for me though, especially mentally. I applied for disability almost 14 months ago. I have jumped through all the hoops, been denied twice, and am now awaiting my court date, aka last chance court. everytime I got back to work, 2-3 months later I'm stressed and flairing up and need to get hospitalized. I have found its hard to curb usage when you literally are sitting at home with nada to do, and have been in this loop for 14 months now. First month or two was great, not so much now...

So are there any other ways you trick/force yourself to not do as much as to stretch out your ß and not w/d. I have tried not ordering rigs, hiding pills while sober, hiding pills while high, getting a cheap pill divider so I can visual see what I'm doing, mix with dph at night so I sleep a full 8 hours and not wake and spike 10 times.

Seems like a stupid question but it's late and I'm trying to distract myself until 8am.

When I was younger I thought it was clear cut. Addiction was a choice. The choice to get fucked up. The choice to spend your money getting high, gambling, or just hurting yourself. On some level I still agree with that. Certainly I was never possessed, I was in control of my limbs, my fingers, my thoughts. No one held a gun to my head and said “buy heroin. Buy pills. Shoot it up. Sniff them,” but at the same time its not as simple as that. It's a fucking compulsion. 

It's almost every fiber in my being saying “heroin will help. Oxycodone will help,” except for that one little part in the back of my mind, that one part that knows that it wont help. This little part that knows that it's making things worse. This part knows that I am making things worse, hurting myself. But for an hour, for three hours, life is simple. There's no depression. There's no loneliness. There's the routine of scrounging up your money, seeing how much you can spend. Calling the dealer. Trying to get a deal for as much as you can get for the least amount possible. And then you make the drive, the walk, the ride to meet up. You wait. You wait until, by sweet, sweet mercy your dealer comes through. He gives you the stuff. And you get high. You get as high as you possibly can. Nothing to do for the rest of the day? Get fucking blitzed. Get fucked up. Get gone so that you can't feel. 

Get high because when you're high, every thing is good. Every thing is right. You aren't unemployed. You aren't a million miles from your woman. You aren't alone. You aren't broke. You aren't depressed and your room isn't a mess and who fucking cares that you haven't had the motivation to shower. You are high. You are happy. You got yourself that rush and you got yourself that itch and for a little while you're okay.

And then you're not high anymore. You sober up. And your problems all come back. And it's hard. It is so fucking hard. Now that you're broke or you can't get a ride, or your dealer is out of touch, there's no reason to get out of bed. Your woman is a thousand miles away and it feels like she's the only one who cares if you do anything anyway. And you want to make something of yourself for her, but she's so far away. She can't see you anyway. You know she loves you so maybe every other day you can get off your ass to take a shower at least...

It isn't fair. It just isn't fucking fair. Getting high, getting drunk, getting FUCKED up is so, so much easier than everything else. Self destruction is so much easier than everything else. It's easier to kill yourself than to live. And that isn't okay. I've got a partner, friends, a dog, and family who that wouldn't be fair to. It would be so much less fair than the fact that it's easier to self destruct than to do something productive, because that wouldn't be life and circumstance fucking them over. That would be me fucking them over. And I don't want to hurt the people that I love more than I want to hurt myself. 

When my girlfriend asked me to quit getting high, getting drunk, I was so ashamed.  Ashamed because she had to ask me.  And ashamed because it's so much easier to get high than not to. On paper, it's easier to be sober. All you have to do is not go through that ritual. Just don't pick up. Be sober, or dry for a day or two. But then there's that compulsion.

And this isn't a novel experience. I'm not even the first person in my own family to struggle with addiction, far from it. I am not the tenth, thousandth, or billionth person to deal with, or try to deal with this. That sucks. That makes this feel worse, to me. That not only is this not special, that I am one of billions who fail at this. Because even in trying to stay sober, I slip up. I tell myself that it's okay that everyone makes mistakes or maybe I'll tell myself that I will just start again tomorrow. Like every one else who has tried this same thing. I am struggling to find what makes me different. I am struggling to find what makes me stronger. I am struggling to find, in myself, a reason, for myself, not to just self destruct. I know that I need a reason for ME. I know that I need a reason for myself to take care of myself, but it is the needle in the hay stack. 
And I am ashamed. I would like to think of myself as a strong person, but I know that I am wrong. I am only strong enough to make these empty promises, to make these false gestures. So what is addiction? Addiction is crippling fucking weakness.",1423887723.0

As soon as she said that, a commercial about a sick woman shows up. She's withdrawing from heroin and starts listing her symptoms. You know, runny nose, diarrhea, restless legs and so on. I got the fuck out of the room as soon as I could just so I didn't have to look at my parents while the commercial was on. Luckily, they weren't paying attention to the tv so they didn't put two and two together. Fuck those commercials man. ",1423884512.0

With the like-minded ambition of getting high, we were two junkie peas in a pod. And after a short conversation, he turns out to be a low level dealer, and a user as well. 

Looking back, I honestly don’t even know why I cared to meet him. I had other connections in SF besides the open air markets and even better ones across the bay. I could have just as easily hit them up and been on my way, not having to risk dealing with a new party.

I think that after some of the fear of the whole dope game wears off, it actually becomes fun. Well,maybe 'fun' isn't the right word, but it certainly can be an adrenaline rush. Making new connections, trying new dope, finding a lost sack, having your dealer finally text back, successfully cold copping; these little “wins” of the game keep your head up just enough to keep it mentally addictive on top of the physical addiction. Right when everything gets to the point of being unbearable, something nice will happen that reminds you why you stick with this lifestyle. Kind of like how slot machines are supposed to pay little amounts every so often to keep you going.

Anyway, Skeet was getting ready to go out; I had caught him before he left for his morning pickup. He had a dime bag he offered to sell me, but of course, I refuse--not wanting to waste my sickness on just getting back to normal--I needed to save myself for a righteous rush.

The room itself was clean enough--for a drug user. Although the carpet was matted and stained, the bed spotted with cigarette burns, the cement wall pocketed with divots from years of use and neglect, the 150 sq ft. room overall felt weirdly comfortable. I also remember an easy-going feeling in Skeet’s presence. Where any normal personal would have been uncomfortable and claustrophobic, the thought of scoring soon gave me all the room to breathe I needed.

As I stand in the cramped room, I scan the interior and my eye catches something sitting low in the far corner in between myself and where skeet is still preparing his wardrobe for the outside. I corner my neck to get a better view.

To this day I don’t know why I cared or why it stuck out to me, but I was mesmerized by this backpack sitting in the corner. It was a sand colored canvas backpack with dark brown leather straps and silver metal buckles. I thought it was the slickest looking backpack I've ever seen. And I know it seems kind of weird that I even mention it at this point but that bag, strangely enough, became a significant part of that day.

“Hey can I buy that backpack off you?” I asked. 

And just note here how out of character of a question that is for me--due to my low funds and no job. I did have a little bit of cash because of some jewelry I had pawned earlier in the week, but honestly, when you’re a junkie, any amount of money that could be spent on something that isn't dope, is better spent on dope. So it was weird that I even wanted to buy it.

“That ain’t for sale,” he said as he raised his head to meet my eyes. He had a curious look.

“I’ll give you $50 for it?” I shot back.

“Nah,” Skeet replied quickly and dismissively.

“I’ll give you $75 for that backpack.”

“Nah, man”

“Dude, I will give you $100 cash right now, for that bag” I didn't really want to spend a hundred dollars on it, but I kind of just wanted to see what he said.

“Motha fucka that shit aint for sale!” he stammered, clearly getting agitated.

At that point I shrugged and let it go. Although I’ve never seen a design like that maybe I can just go buy one myself I thought. But damn, I really wanted that backpack.

Skeet finishes getting ready and soon enough we are heading out into the city walking along side by side. Skeet was puffing away at a cigarette, trying to get a hold of his dealer with his cell phone.

“Fuckin’ –a” he kept repeating to himself. “Damn fool ain't pickin up. Don’t worry though I got another dude though who’s always ready. You got the money?” he asked.

Why I always convince myself I won’t let my money walk, but then do it anyway I will never know. The last thing I wanted was to jeopardize anything, so I begrudgingly hand him the cash--hoping to god our new found friendship was strong enough to withstand one fair transaction. I purposely kept mentioning how I've got a big habit and pick up every day. If he was any sort of businessman, he’d want me as a continuous client I figured.

“He on the other side of the plaza, we’ll be there in a minute” Skeet said.

On the walk there this guy seemingly knew everybody. He was saying hi to just about every low life looking person on the way. People nodded at him, he nodded back. It was clear he was well known. I found it surprising I had never crossed paths with him before this point.

The deal went surprisingly quick. He didn't let me meet his dude, but he let me watch from afar. We high-tail it back to the Henry Hotel to fix.

It wasn't a mere 10 seconds before we got back to his room that I had my kit out, ready to go. I’m sitting there like a hungry child waiting for dessert when he pinches the bag with his cut for middle-manning, and hands the rest to me. By the weight it appears I got a fair deal. But we will know for sure soon.

After quickly cooking up my dose, I found the vein on the first try (another junkie “win!”). I couldn't really see the plume of blood because the liquid was already too dark, but by the snap of my skin I could feel the needle found its way in the right spot. The dope was thick and gave resistance to the plunger, but that was to be expected for typical SF stuff. 

A little red dot appears where the needle had been and I lick it clean. Per my usual ritual routine, I play a little game where I try and clean out the rig before the rush comes on. So I quickly suck up some water and push it back out, and repeat this twice. I won this time. I sit there waiting for the rush that never came. God-damn.

I immediately fill the rest of the dope in the rig and shoot up the entire thing. I’m well, but damn, what a let down.

“That shit sucked man” I say to Skeet, who I hadn't said a word to since we came back to the room.

“Ya well my regular dude has fire if he just would have picked up, I’ll give you a good deal on that to make up for it” Skeet's voice trailed off as he finally was able to hit the mark, and pushed the plunger down slowly and precisely.

“Oh, thanks” I say a bit sharply as my eyes roll.

By this time in the day it was almost noon and I knew my main dude, Jock, would be up by now and ready to go in Oakland. And although Skeet half-assed ripped me off, I still liked him enough to think to invite him.

“I’m going to go get some real dope in Oakland bro, you can come if you want.”

Skeet just nods his head, his focus clearly on his arm, “Yeah, sure.” A bit of drool hanging was hanging from the left corner of his mouth.

I figured since the dope I could get over on the other side of the Bay was about ten times anything he could get, maybe I could get him to buy some and I’d make some of my money back off this poor choice.

About 20 minutes later we head out to my truck, which was still parked over by 4th and mission from when I wanted to meet Rosie at 4am in the morning. Since it was the middle of the day on the weekday, we got across the Bay rather quickly. As soon as we crossed the bridge and entered Oakland, I called Jock. He answers on the first ring and proceeds to tell me where to meet. He was always on point. He also has some of the best stuff I've ever had, anywhere.

Everything next kind of went easily. After before I knew it, Jock, wearing his usual leather jacket and dark blue jeans appears to my side window. I notice his lingering glance at Skeet. He turns his attention back to me and the deal is done quickly, bare minimum of words exchanged, Jock was a professional.

We decide to stop by my apartment before heading back into the city, which was near Oakland anyway. I was going to let Skeet try a little bit of Jock’s stuff for free. If that other shit from earlier was what he was used to, I knew for sure he’d downright blow me for a gram of this stuff.

After we fix for the second time in the day, Skeet tries to act unimpressed. 

“It’s aite, my main dude gots fire though,” he said, never once looking me in the eyes.

But, I could tell he was blitzed. What a jackass it thought. But in a weird way this quirky dude with a dumb name was growing on me. I don’t know, maybe I just enjoyed the company, as this all was usually a solo venture for me. He was friendly enough when we were sitting there in my apartment. 

I put some music on and we both had a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch. It seemed my day was finally turning around.

Shortly thereafter, Skeet gets a phone call. It’s his main hook, Trev. And we mutually decide to head back into the city. We had probably spent an hour or so at my place. As we are leaving, my friend Brias hits me up asking if I could bring him a sack of Jock’s stuff to him, down by the mall on Market St.--perfect timing. I text him back: Sure omw.

After my second time paying the bridge toll that day, we were back in the City.

I just got a surprise come up of sorts and have couple of questions. Would appreciate some feedback.,"Ok so it's friday, direct deposit went through, and it's just a matter of time waiting for the call back. 

My first string dope has been on hiatus for a week and a half or so, as it tends to do every month or two. It's pretty much always the same dope, same bags, same price and is always the best I've had in this area. It sucks when it's gone, but it's always just a matter of time before it's back.

So I'm calling my second string guy, who is younger and doesn't like to answer the phone and will just make you wait for long periods time, no matter how much money you are trying to throw at him. It's like he doesn't wanna come out until he has multiple links lined up and he can hit everyone at once. 

So I'm waiting, been calling since like 9am, no answer, getting frustrated, and starting to feel anxious and a little shitty. Start hitting up my 3rd and 4th string dudes. As soon as I'm thinking of taking a sub or risking money on dope from the last option guys,  I get the call from first string guy saying the good bags are back and to come on through.  Yes!!! Was figuring on getting weaker shit and ended with the good good.  

So I throw my usual amount in my rig and fire away and, fuck!!! It's strong as hell but the rush is not the usual warm, euphoric blanket of goodness. Instead it's an extremely painful, pin prick, burning skin, itchy, morphine type rush. It calms down after a 30 seconds or so, but damn is it uncomfortable until it does. The high is wonderful with legs that just keep on going,  but damn that rush is something else. 

So, my questions:

1. why is this all of a sudden so painful? Is the cut causing a histamine response or is the dope not refined properly leaving morphine type alkaloids in the mix? Does anyone have any idea  why that would happen? Do they cut it with morphine perhaps?

2. How do you post dope porn? I wouldn't mind posting a couple of pics, but want to make sure it's anonymous... also how do you link it but make the link some kind of text, like where you click on a sentence or a phrase instead of having some long crazy link. 


Sorry for the rambling post,  but that's the way it goes when I'm feeling good. Tend to blather on a little. I look forward to hearing your feedback if anyone cares to help me out.",1423849580.0

I found these items in a family member's room. I am quite naive and completely inexperienced when it comes to drugs so I wanted to ask - does this look like Heroin?

The needle was in a drawer. The spoon was on a desk in plain sight and still is. 

The first thing to cross my mind was heroin. I don't know shit though. I asked an r/drugs mod (posting substance IDs are banned) on possible substances I could test for and he suggested heroin. I will get a test kit ASAP, but I wanted to ask for some more opinions.

The stuff on the spoon smells sweet. Like a caramel-y coffee drink. 

If these images and descriptions match heroin, any advice on how I should approach the situation? The family member in question is not at all honest with me, and I feel will just deny it and hide the habit better if I ask directly without concrete proof.

Thank you for your help.

Edit: Also, I might as well ask - are there any behavioral changes that indicate recent use? Like the morning after? I found the needle yesterday morning, checked up on it again today and it doesn't seem to have been touched since. The person in question is acting completely normally since this morning, went to work as usual etc. Is there any way to tell the degree to which he's using?",1423992211.0

I also have decent experiance with other recreational drugs but I dont really have any desire to try any opiates other than codiene and kratom really.

It's a diarrhea medication that's schedule V (you can technically get it without an rx at the pharmacist's discretion but I've never heard of it happening in this day and age), but pretty easy to get a script of.

You have to take a lot of them even with a low tolerance, and they have atropine in them. In my experience taking a whole script of 30 at one time, the atropine does become noticeable but not really unpleasant or anything, and if you have a low-ish to moderate tolerance, the diphenoxylate in them is quite pleasant at that dose.

I'm sure this is obvious to most of you, but you'd be surprised how many people I've told this to didn't know what it was.",1423974411.0

Hopefully this is the right place to post this!

I've terrible drug anxiety. Have taken 1 x 30mg around an hour ago, and the effects are *just* noticeable, pain is still there. Didn't want to take the full dose straight away just in case it didn't agree with me. Should I just wait longer, or take the other 30mg?

Never taken morphine before, though I take cocodamol 30/500 regularly.

It's been around 8+ years. I used daily for 5-6 years (literally...I was sober less than 10 days in that entire period), and then some shit happened and I got clean. Terrible withdrawal and all that of course. Depression lasted for about a year. After that, everything was fine, but the cravings never went away. It was like I had this childish part of my brain that demanded instant gratification or it wouldn't let me concentrate on anything else. Eventually this wore me down and I started chipping (mainly heroin), but kept it controlled. The routine was get high daily for 2 weeks, take 4 weeks off (yes there was some withdrawal each time), and then that nagging voice would come back and I would do it again. I did that for about a year and it was fine, but the cravings and opiate-obsessed mind state always came back. That state of craving is worse than withdrawal...it's just torture and never goes away.

So recently I was reading some research papers and came across Propanolol (usually used as a blood pressure med) being used to treat addiction. It works by blocking the brain's beta-adrenergic receptors. This has the interesting and previously unknown side effect of being able to affect deep memories that cause things like PTSD and addiction. I had to try it (I love experimenting on myself), so I convinced my doctor to prescribe me 80mg extended release once per day (I already have high blood pressure so this was easy).

Let me tell you guys - this is the only non-opioid that has ever quieted the nagging cravings to get high. I can walk into a place or situation that used to trigger intense cravings and feel nothing. It also has to ability to lessen the effects of physical withdrawal. During withdrawal, your body cranks out way too much adrenaline, creating anxiety, insomnia, restlessness, etc. By blocking the adrenaline, much of this goes away. To me, this is a godsend.

If you have tried to quit, but the long term cravings always got you, I would highly recommend reading up on this drug. If it sounds interesting, it should not be hard to get a prescription. ",1423939046.0
