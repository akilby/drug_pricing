Stay the fuck away.","To those of you braving this fierce winter storm in Toronto - there are carfentanil pills floating around the city disguised as oxycodone - Blue MBox Oxy 30's - ready to take your life. I would just recommend avoiding any of these mbox pills until this is under control. They aren't common here to begin with anyway since the main Oxy pills are OxyIR, Supeudol, and then ER APO-OCD, OxyNeo, etc, but if they're being sold for cheap I'm sure people will flock and it can be a fatal mistake.

Don't know what it is up here with the pill pressers using fake Oxy pills to load up all this shit. First the problem started in western Canada with fake OC80's (CDN) containing 100% pure fentanyl which spread across the country - and took many lives with it when people thought they were taking oxycodone not fentanyl. Now we have basically the same scheme occurring but with carfentanil. Wtf.

Stay warm. Stay safe. Always carry naloxone (and if you're Canadian and live in Ontario you have NO excuse. It's 100% free, costs you nothing, and can be obtained from any pharmacy - Shoppers, Rexall, mom & pop, you name it. Government law!).

today I went in to see my doctor and ask him whether I could get a take home prescription over the holidays to ""visit my family"". In the end he said I'll get the prescription for methadone and not my usual morphine, bc it's less abusable and under the condition that the saliva test taken today turns out clean. He confronted me about my last test and said there were minimal amounts of 6mam. Now here's the weird part. I relapsed around the 15th Nov to 18th Nov and have only shot morphine a couple times after that, which should only show higher levels of morphine, my usual substitute. The test was on 7th Dec. Did anyone else ever experience anything like that or has an idea why I got tested positive for 6mam even though every single metabolite should have been out after seven days? I plan to reward myself with a binge during my days off, but I'm afraid that I'll be positive for coke and heroin even though I take a 4day break before being tested again.

IV user 17-21 then 23-24. Recently I've been much better. My use this past year was never longer than a couple weeks. But I overdosed and almost died at my old job(bartender) and scared everyone because I hadn't used opiates in almost 3 years. They all thought I was good. 

I kept going, went to rehab, kept using, was homeless now I've been great for 3 months. Have a new amazing job as an electrician and I'm working for my step dad so I have The opportunity to take over one day. Been talking to girls and have plans with one to visit me in a couple weeks, one coming in March, then I'm going back to philly to see a different one in July.

Not trying to brag, I'm saying this is not my MO. My MO is shooting heroin til I have nothing left. 

Now that I have the world in my hands and life is going great I feel the pull of the void. Heroin is forever inside and a part of me. Why am I like this? 

Last Friday I did about .2 and after the night was over I broke my works. Have plans to meet my plug/friend tomorrow and do the same thing.

When he showed up at his parents house his mother (who is super religious and a preschool teacher at a Christian private school) said he could stay, on two conditions: he had to get clean and he had to play the part of Jesus in the schools Christmas production, which was the next night.

I've been clean for a few years but I've also been bouncing around the US, Europe and Asia living and working so staying clean has been easier than normal.

1. Have any of you tried poppy pod tea before? If so, did it really do anything for you?

2. Is it even legal to possess them in the US? If so, can anyone make a recommendation as to a reputable website to buy them from?

3. Is there any other alternative anybody can recommend (besides Kratom- I'm already using that) to dope that's filed down cravings?

During a recent visit to a couple of junkie/dealer acquaintances me and the girlfriend met at our old hookups trap house, the unexpected happened. To preface what is about to transpire, these two squatted in our plugs crib after it was raided by city police, sold all of his things and ran dope out of there until the sheriff came and changed the locks. Prior to being incarcerated, our guy helped these two out like they were his own children, housing and feeding (both literally and their habits) them until they started to chop customers in his backyard, they only reappeared after his arrest to stake a claim that nobody bothered to contest, even kicking dudes old lady out to the curb upon their arrival, not a shred of respect or fuck given on their part, it was disgusting, but it was also none of our business, we had spoken to dude from the remand center and he said not to worry about it, he'll take crew of it.
Fast forward to meeting these two shitbirds at their new basement suite, literally their move in day, first day on the new lease, everything still boxed up. They were just cleaning up a bit when we arrived, the last tenant did a midnight move (the landlord was a notorious slumlord who prays on people without credit or rental history and the unemployed) so we sat and smoked cigarettes and caught up before buddy went to pull out his dope sack. All of a sudden... BOOM... like really fucking loud, like a gun going off beside your head. WTF? I thought someone from the rooming house above us was playing with fire crackers or something. Nope, fucking gang unit member in full tactical regalia was pointing his assault rifle at me down through the basement window well. It took them a while to find the entryway, because it looked like a utility closet and was located on the exterior of the house upstairs. It gave dude enough time to suitcase his heroin and for us to rid our personal effects of anything incriminating. We had to crawl up the stairs under gunpoint to be cuffed, processed and as for us, me and my girlfriend, we were released from the scene and told never to return. As for the two occupants, after discovering they had a no contact order with each other, as they were coaccused on a different matter, they were held, that basement was searched and they found a roach and 2 10mg oxycontins stashed from previous tenants, they were charged and held for possession with intent, .2 grams of marijuana and the pills. They lost their damage deposit, first month rent ($1400!) and all of their possessions after being remanded for two months while awaiting disclosure from the prosecutor. Who knew that the tenants upstairs were all members of a notorious street gang that ran that Drug house with absolutely no regard for opsec, as far as I'm concerned, they were fed their just desserts on that matter.

Leaves for 1-3 days at a time (fine if she'd pick up her phone and serve me). I will literally hit her up 12-24 hrs ahead of time to pick up. Lately she's been so paranoid she thinks I've been stealing from her and not paying her. This is coming from the person that will fall out for 12-18 hrs str8 (one time pants down and in face full of dirty dishes in a sink) a fkn earthquake would not wake her. I have fkn receipts from where she used my card to pull out the money I owed her and still thinks it is fake and I conspiring against her.
 I literally made a calendar printed out bank statements and showed her the receipts she gave back ever time She uses my card and still wants to fight about it. I hate ppl who are so fkd in the head they think everyone's out to get them. I guess it some form of PTWS. 
I usually stay loyal to her still(I know guys shit of me but she fronts me and gives me good deals soo) but today I could not take it, started hitting her up at 1030am and she's been telling me shortly ever since. so hit up my other connect and that mofo hopped on two busses and came to me faster then her if she was down at the corner gas station and he brought some fire!!!! Just makes me think why I am so loyal and nice all the time. Nice guys finish last. 
Sometimes the extra 10-20bucks is worth not putting up with the bs. But if she was to find out she'd get all pissy and pull the same bs she's doing now. Faster you sell dope, faster user uses it then sale more it's not fkn rocket science. 

Ps it's been 4 hrs since she said she was on her way (literally 4 miles away when I called her) 

I guess this turned into a shit post but that's been my life. Ppl out there get as many dealers as you can don't rely on one person (duhhhhhh) ",1481959167.0

When I pick up the bth is super distinguishable rock wise. it has the taste that all smokers know of fire dope. The trails are like light greyish in color and look like a  watercolor brush stroke. It leaves that yellowish white powder resin in the tooter. All is well and I am a happy camper. Well besides the price but oh well, love my dude. Always on time always reliable and consistant af. I'm down to pay a little more for quality realiability. But anyway, after I pick up I drive back home a couple hours north and up. After a couple days the bth changes in appearance and quality. It makes zero sense and is really beginning to piss me off. What is weird is I know it's dank when I get it, I'll wait a few days and it's still good but not the same as when I picked it up first , but then I go back down to grab more and it's back to being fire like it originally was. 

So my question is...has anyone else experienced anything like this ? Does it sound like a possibility ? Would altitude/humidity/ other variables really cause some fire bth to change like that? ",1481957352.0

It's been a while since I made such a journey, and as I hurried down the streets in a futile attempt to accomplish my mission before freezing my balls off, I noticed that there were far fewer corners in operation than there had been in the past. In fact, I only came across two during the course of my eight-block walk. That's unheard of for high noon in a city that's been dubbed the heroin capital of [country redacted]. (Frankly, I was appalled that so many dealers were more concerned with not getting frostbite than with serving me. How selfish of them! /s)

I pondered this situation and came up with a theory explaining this extraordinary lack of initiative on the part of the corner boys. I think that bad weather conditions separate the boys from the men (figurative boys and figurative men, I should add, because the kid who handed me the goodies couldn't have been older than 16). The dickbrains who wanna play with guns and sell bunk shit so they can brag about moving bricks have no problem taking up space on the sidewalk when it's sunny in [redacted], but when the temperature takes a nosedive they ain't about it no more. But the truly dedicated hood pharmacists who are serious and offer good dope for reasonable prices and treat their business like a business are out there rain or shine, cause they're in it for the long haul. The only evidence I have to support this theory so far is the dope I bought yesterday. It's some good shit (obviously, because I had the patience to type up this whole damn essay about it).

Not in the sense that I'm looking for death, but that I'm losing some parts of me. And I don't really blame anyone but myself yet I continue to put myself in this struggle that only has but a few endings. Not sure what'll happen to me but it seems as though I'm not Caring anymore. Has this happened to anyone? It's my birthday today, yet no one has said anything to me. I want to act like it doesn't bother me, but it did. It did so much. The pain that went thru me today, holding in anticipation that someone would come out and at least ask how I'm doing. But nothing. I don't know. I know this post is meaningless and not many will read but at this point in my life I've acknowledged that I do need someone. Someone there to at least ask me how I'm doing. How my day was.

Been using about a gram a day for the past 5 months and before that was roughly. 5 a day the previous 7 months. Before I started with H.... I went through massive amounts of oxy off and on for the previous 9 years. I snort everything and sometimes think that I'm more addicted to snorting than anything else. 

In my kit...

62 10 MG tabs

5 clonopine  (sp)? ( I can get a few more if needed)

1 pound of kratom  (I bought it before the last ban scare)

7500 MG of lyrica script  ( I can only take 200 MG every 4 hours because for some reason it makes me black out at higher doses)

Lope 

20 tramadol 

I'm not too concerned about the physical part. I think that the combo of tabs, lope and kratom should take care of those for the most part. However, I'm terrified of the mental part and that's the part that is keeping me up at night!

Just like everyone else around here....this is probably my thousandth time of going through WD, but besides the time I got off a 500 MG a day oxy habit with subs....this will be the most intense. 

Does anyone have any recommendations to help me through this and do you think I have enough tabs and kratom to get past the physical part?",1482036511.0

Well everything goes as planned we get our dope and coke then proceed to a parking lot not far away where we were to meet Jim's brother to give him a few bags. Well while we wait for his brother everyone decides to get high and in the middle of mixing up my shot a car pulls up next to us and a fucking cop gets out and walks straight to our car. My nuts jumped into my throat because there was no way we weren't busted. The cop gets to our car opens the back drivers side door and sits down, turns out it's Jim's brother, so he sat there did a shot with us and left. Turns out I was the only one in the car who didn't know Jim's brother was a cop so everyone thought it was hilarious that I almost shit myself over the situation.

**Hydration**

Your body needs water to survive and stay healthy. While detoxing from opioids you'll likely be suffering from diarrhea, nausea, and profuse sweating, all of which contribute to dehydration. Maintaining good fluid levels is integral to getting and feeling better and should be a priority whenever you are sick including withdrawal. Water, juice, soup, whatever you can take and keep down you should be consuming. Although people say detoxing from opioids isn't inherently deadly (as compared to benzos/booze), it does put a lot of stress on your heart and other organs and dehydration can be dangerous as well.


**Electrolytes**

Along with needing fluids in your body, you need ions in those fluids which are known as electrolytes. They are integral to proper muscle and nerve function (including your heart) and a lack of them will result in cramps, seizures, and other nasty problems. Just as diarrhea, vomiting, and sweating decrease fluid content, they also decrease electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium) and need to be replaced. Sports drinks are an excellent source, but juice and soup will do as well. Hydration is important, but be sure you don't over do it on just water.


**Vitamins and Minerals**

Although some of these fall under the category of electrolytes, vitamins and minerals are important for proper bodily functions. Although they can be obtained naturally from dietary sources, in the midst of opioid withdrawal you might not be feeling too hungry and taking a good multivitamin can help supply your body with everything it needs to get back on track.


**Food**

Your heart pounding, shivering body will surely be craving some energy, and calories in the form of food is where it comes from. That being said, if you are way too sick to eat then there is nothing wrong with sticking to juices and soups until feeling a little better. Getting some fresh fruit in your stomach can do wonders for your mentality though and sometimes help with nausea as well. Ensure shakes are another great way to get some nutrition when solid food isn't treating you right. They are packed with all kinds of vitamins and will supply you with calories that you desperately need.


**Sleep**

It may be hard, but your body and brain needs sleep to heal and repair. There are drugs which can help, but resting and at least trying to sleep is just as important as keeping active and trying to keep your mind off of withdrawal. Diphenhydramine is a good OTC drug that will help with sleep at a dose of about 50mg. If you are having trouble with restless legs try taking black haw or cramp bark. These are both natural antispasmodics which relieve muscle cramping.


**OTC Drugs**

There are many drugs which are often available over the counter that can do wonders for helping alleviate certain symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Some of the more commonly used ones are listed here.

***Loperamide*** - First, let me start by saying loperamide is a godsend and your best friend when in withdrawal. Loperamide (generic Immodium) is an opioid-receptor agonist and acts on the μ-opioid receptors in the myenteric plexus of the large intestine; by itself it does not affect the central nervous system. Taking loperamide can, and will, alleviate ~75% of the worst withdrawal symptoms. Go and buy the biggest bottle of generic Immodium you can find. Start with a dose of 20mg (10 2mg pills) and see what that does for you. **I do not advise going much higher than that due to cardiotoxicity at *very* high doses.** 

>**[FDA issues warning over loperamide heart risks](http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/news-and-analysis/news-in-brief/fda-issues-warning-over-loperamide-heart-risks/20201302.article)**

***Kava*** - Kava is an awesome plant. It helps with sleep and has powerful anxiolytic properties. Take 4-8 250mg pills for moderate effects.

***Polyethylene Glycol 3350 (Miralax)*** - Take this in combination with loperamide to help 'level' you out, as the loperamide will plug you up when taking high doses to combat withdrawal. Use 17g once a day while constipated from the loperamide.

***Diphenhydramine*** - This is generic Benadryl. It will help you get some sleep. I suggest 50mg. If you over do it you will start to see it's nasty delirient properties. Some people report that DPH makes restless leg worse, so if RLS really bothers you try something else for sleep. Many other common OTC antihistamines also intensify RLS.

***Naproxen sodium*** - Use this for muscle aches and pains. Start out with 500mgs and go from there. Once again, don't over do it as this is an NSAID and is rough on your stomach.

***Arnica, Devil's Claw, and Cat's Claw*** - They all are herbs that will relieve pain, swelling and stiffness.

***Black Haw and Cramp Bark*** - Herbal antispasmotics which relieve muscle and menstrual cramping. 

***Passion Flower (Passiflora incarnata)*** - This is a sedative that will give you a very mild buzz too. It is sold in pills but if you can find the liquid, get that. This stuff actually works pretty darn well for the shakes and irritability.

***Phenibut*** - Phenibut is a legal GABAergic drug that can help tremendously with sleep and anxiety. It is readily available online. Please note that phenibut can be habit forming with terrible withdrawals of it's own and tolerance builds rapidly to it.

***Valerian Root*** - Valerian root helps promote sleep and doesn't cause RLS like many of the antihistamines do.

***Melatonin*** - Natural hormone in your body that anticipates the daily onset of darkness. Taking melatonin has show to help regulate the natural circadian rhythm of your body.

***Dextromethorphan*** - DXM is a derivative of the powerful opioid levorphanol and some people say it helps with their withdrawals. It also may help potentiate the loperamide. I wouldn't go much above 60mg of DXM as it has strong dissociative properties at higher doses, unless you think the DXM trip would be enjoyable while in full blown withdrawal.  

***Multi Vitamins*** - Help replace a lot of vitamins that you may have been lacking due to diarrhea and vomiting. 

****Prescription Non-Opioids****

Only take one of the following, do not mix them. Mixing CNS depressants is dangerous.

***Benzodiazepines*** - Benzos help tremendously with sleep and anxiety. Use the bare minimum here. Xanax and Klonopin dose: 0.5mg, Valium: 10mg, Ativan: 0.5-1mg.

***Z-Drugs*** - esZopiclone (Lunesta), zolipidem (Ambien), zaleplon (Sonata). These are to knock your ass out. One tablet of one of these drugs at bedtime will help with sleep.

***Soma*** - Once again helps with sleep and also helps with muscle cramps and aches. I suggest not taking more than 350mg of Soma.

***Gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica)*** - These are very similar drugs that both help with RLS and anxiety to an extent.  400-600mg is an average dose of gabapentin.

***Clonidine*** - Lowers blood pressure and limits hot/cold flashes. Only take 0.1mg at a time and no more than 0.4mg a day.

***Ropinirole*** - This is an amazing drug that is primarily prescribed to treat Parkinson's Disease but is also prescribed for RLS and it will completely stop RLS. Ask your doctor about it if you can.

***Legal-ish Opioid Substitutes***

If you are just fighting off withdrawals until your next dose check a few of these out*

***Kratom*** - Mitragnya speciosa. This is available online and in some headshops. It is a natural opioid agonist that will completely stop withdrawal. 

***Tianeptine*** - This is also an opioid agonist that was thought to be an SSRE for a long time, however it is not an SSRE. It will also hold off withdrawal for even the largest habit. It is not a controlled substance in the US but is in many countries. It can be purchased online as well. 

**Tips and other things that help**

*Hot baths with Epsom salt*

*Exercise* 

*Marijuana* 

*Heating pads*

*Eat healthy*

*Fresh sheets on the bed (trust me)*

*Stay away from caffeine*

*Get as much rest as possible*

I have never done hard drugs, but I lived in an apartment in Hollywood, California that was haunted by a former tenant who died from an accidental Heroin overdose in the bathroom. His name was Francis and he was 32 years old when he died. He started doing Heroin at age 17. He had lived in the apartment (apartment 104 to be exact) at The Halifax Apartment Building for a year before his overdose happened. The night that he OD'd he had walked down the street and met up with his connection. The guy told him that the stuff was pretty potent and that he should be careful with it. He told him not to do the usual amount because it was pretty pure. However, Francis went home, went in the bathroom and sat on the toilet and did up the dose that killed him. It actually stopped his heart instantly. He fell against the wall and his spirit left his body. He stood outside of his body staring at it. He said ""What the fuck?"" And tried getting back into his body, but he couldn't. A little while later, he felt the withdrawals start to happen. ""How the hell can this be happening?"" He said in confusion. ""I'm getting sick. What the hell can I do now?"" He said. He decided to go out and see if he could find any of his living friends. As he wandered around by where he use to buy at, he noticed one of his friends was buying some stuff. After his friend got something, he walked off and Francis followed him. Once they got to the abandoned building where everyone use to hang out and get high there, Francis followed him in there. About five other people were sitting in there getting high already. Francis' friend sat down and got everything set up. Once his friend was ready to get high, Francis took possession of his friend and took his hit. He absorbed the high and orbed out of his friend's body. He proceeded the the process with everyone else that was in the room. After that he lay on the floor and went to sleep. When he woke up, he noticed that everyone else was waking up too. He then left and wandered around Hollywood for awhile. His corpse was in the bathroom at that apartment for four days until the other tenants noticed the smell coming from the apartment. Once they began to complain about the stench the apartment manager called the police. Francis' ghost was in the apartment when the police showed up. They kicked the door in and the smell overwhelmed them. They walked over to the bathroom door and opened it. There sat Francis' body on the toilet, rotting and smelling. One of the cops vomited near the bathroom door. The other cop said ""Another dead junkie, who died from an OD."" The cop who threw up said ""Want me to call the medical examiner?"" The cop who was standing in the bathroom walked out and joined the other cop in the hallway. They walked out of the apartment and into the hallway. Francis followed them out into the hallway. The one cop got on his radio and called in for the medical examiner. Once the medical examiner showed up he asked what was going on. The older cop said ""Some young Mexican guy OD'd in there. Still has the needle in him."" The medical examiner walked into the apartment and walked into the bathroom. ""Good lord!"" He yelled and covered his mouth. Francis stood behind him. ""Well you wouldn't be all that good if your body was sitting on a toilet for four or five days either, you son of a bitch!"" Francis walked into the living room. When the gurney was brought into the apartment and into the hallway by the bathroom, the two cops went into the bathroom with the medical examiner. Francis was sitting on the sofa in the living room. When they pulled his dead body off of the toilet, it sounded like velcro being pulled. A few minutes later they had his body in a body bag and wheeled it out of the apartment. ""Thank God, that stinky thing is out of here!"" Francis said while sitting on the couch. Then the thought dawned on him. ""Ah, shit. I'm talking about my own corpse. I need a fix bad."" He got up and walked out of the apartment and into the hallway. He orbed out of the building and over to Yucca Street. There was a little store on Yucca Street where people usually bought at in the parking lot. There were a few of his friends hanging around in that parking lot. One of the dealers that he knew walked up to them One of his friends said ""I haven't seen Francis in over a week. Have you?"" The dealer shook his head no. ""I haven't seen him in about six days."" The dealer said. One of Francis' other friends replied ""Well, he lives right over there in that apartment building across the street. Maybe he decided to get clean or something."" Francis was standing near the guy. After everybody bought what they wanted, they walked off over to that abandoned building. Francis followed them in. He got use to having to take possession of people in order to get high. He died in 1982. I moved into the apartment that he haunted in 1997. After two weeks of me living there, he decided to get clean. I'm a medium and can see and hear ghosts. My spirit guide Joseph was at the apartment with me. ""How long have you been using for?"" Joseph asked him. ""Since I've been dead or from the time I was alive?"" Francis asked him. ""Both."" Joseph told him. Francis sighed and said ""I was using for the last four months of my life and then after my death, for thirteen years."" Joseph replied ""I was a junkie too for most of my life and then after my death I used for nine years. Then I stopped."" Francis looked at him. ""How'd you quit?"" He asked him. ""April helped me, by letting me kick at her old apartment in San Bernardino."" Francis looked worried. ""How does a ghost kick? I mean, what the hell are the withdrawals for a ghost anyways?"" Joseph sighed. ""Same as they are when you're alive, except with a few added differences."" ""What made you quit?"" Francis asked him. Joseph looked at him. ""I got sick and tired of having to get high every day and being sick all the time. When I quit, I was having to possess twelve people every   three hours, take their highs and nod off. I was just getting tired of it all. Besides I hated having to possess a lot of those people cuz I didn't even like them."" Joseph told him. Francis sighed nervously. ""I'm getting sick and tired of this shit too. I wake up sick as a dog and then got to go possess a dozen or more people in the morning just to not be sick. Plus, some of the people who actually could see me got scared and tried to fight me from taking possession of them and I had to get violent with them in order to enter their bodies. I once chased a guy through a dope house until he was cornered in a room. He kept screaming ""What the hell are you? Get away from me! No! No! Stop it!""  I then took possession of him, sat down on the floor, cooked up all three of his bags, shot, absorbed it and channeled out of him.""  Joseph frowned. ""Yeah, I've been there hundreds of times in that situation. It sucks, doesn't it?"" He said to Francis. Francis walked over to where Joseph was sitting on the sofa that I had. He sat down. ""I'm just so tired of this shit. But I'm scared of kicking as a ghost."" Francis told him. ""So was I when I kicked. But I tell ya', I've been clean for over two years now and it feels great. No more getting sick, no more having to possess people all day and night. If you want to quit Francis, the withdrawals last for about five days, just like when you're alive."" ""I'm doing one last run before I quit."" Francis told him. Joseph looked at him. ""Then go do your last fix before you quit. Make it a good one."" He told him.  Francis laughed and said, ""I plan to. It's going to be my last one."" He orbed out of the apartment to find some people to get high through. Joseph and I sat there talking to each other about Francis. When Francis got back in the apartment he was loaded. He lay down on the floor and stretched out. ""How many people did you possess, man?"" Joseph said with a chuckle. Francis mumbled, ""Twenty five."" Then he passed out to sleep. Later on when Francis woke up, he sat up on the floor. For the rest of the day he just seemed restless and full of anxiety. He kept pacing and walking all over the apartment. It was like seeing someone going stir crazy. By five O'clock that night he was sweating an ectoplasmic residue like sweat slimy substance all over his face. He had the shakes very bad. He lay down on the couch in the fetal position. I put three blankets over the couch, draping them from the top of the back of the couch over the cushions. He lay under them. I started to smell a vinegar and sulfur smell coming from the sofa. It smelled really bad. Joseph looked over at the sofa. He was sitting on the floor by the bed where I was sitting. ""He's going to get the heaves in about two minutes."" Joseph told me. I could see the blankets move a little on the sofa like he was moving around under the blankets. ""You alright, Francis?"" I asked him. ""No. Oh God! I'm hurting really bad! I can't do this you guys!"" He yelled. ""Yes you can, man. I went through it before."" Joseph told him. ""Fuck, this is worse than when I was alive!"" Francis yelled. He sat up on the sofa and began violently retching with dry heaves. Soon, this ectoplasmic residue flowed out of his mouth like fog and electricity. It evaporated within seconds. For about five seconds he wasn't retching. Then the heaves hit him again. He lay down on the sofa and kept heaving until the fog like electrical energy came flowing out of his mouth again. He was jerking and shaking as if he was being electrocuted. This lasted for about fifteen seconds and then stopped. He lay there still for ten seconds and the jerking and shaking started up again. It lasted for about thirty seconds this time. I noticed this stench coming from the couch like sulfur, rotten eggs, electricity and feces. I noticed that he wasn't shaking at that moment. He just lay there talking. ""Joseph. How in the hell did you get through this?"" Joseph got up and walked over to the couch. ""I just did. It took five days of what you're going through, and then it was over with."" Francis started shaking and jerking again. It lasted for thirty seconds this time with that ectoplasmic stuff coming out of his mouth. ""What is it that keeps coming out of his mouth, Joseph?"" I asked Joseph. ""It's equivalent to vomit."" Joseph told me. ""What about the electrical sulfur poop smell?"" I asked him. ""Equivalent to shit. It's all energy, it's flowing out of him like the runs."" Joseph said. ""Francis? Does it hurt?"" I asked him. He was shivering and shook his head yes. ""I hurt so damn bad, you guys! God, I thought withdrawals were bad enough when I was living! Oh God, I'm going to puke again!""  He emitted more of that electrical fog out of his mouth. ""April, go run a hot bath for him okay? Please?"" I said ""Okay"" and got up and walked into the bathroom and filled the tub with really hot bath water. ""It's ready."" I shouted. Francis orbed into the bathroom and went into a large fog like mist form and went into the water. It looked like lightning coursing through water. I touched the water to see what it was like. I felt all the heat being absorbed from the water and within twenty seconds the bath water was ice cold. He went into human form for a moment. I left the bathroom and walked into the kitchen and got me a cup of coffee. Francis orbed back into the living room and lay back down on the sofa. This lasted like this for five days straight. After the withdrawals were over, Francis was better. Joseph and Francis became best of friends. Like brothers. As time went on, the three of us became best friends. Francis and Joseph both   kept clean off of Heroin together. They joked around, sharing stories from their lives with one another. I'm completely phobic of needles and blood. I always have been. They always got a laugh over that. I even hate to get a flu shot. One time, I had to go to the hospital because of an Ovarian cyst and I was there overnight. They had to draw blood from me at the hospital. Joseph volunteered to channel through my body while the lab people drew my blood. I let him do so, so I wouldn't have to experience it. Afterwards, he channeled out once they put the band aid on my arm. I could still feel the pain where they drew my blood. ""Yuck! I hate this feeling, it hurts."" I said looking at Joseph and Francis. They both smiled and chuckled. ""Well, we don't mind it. We'll channel whenever you need your blood drawn or a flu shot."" Joseph said with a grin. I cringed and said ""I don't know how people can do it. Needles scare me. I can't stand them. Not even flu shots."" Both of them laughed. ""I know, I've been your spirit guide for six years now. I've seen you almost faint when a nurse walked in the room one time with an antibiotic shot to give to you."" I looked at them. ""Yeah, I remember that, I had you channel through me Joseph and you took the antibiotic shot for me."" I said with a funny expression on my face. ""I remember it too. They stuck you on the ass with it. I hadn't had to experience getting an antibiotic shot on my ass since I was alive."" He said with a laugh. Francis laughed too. When I finally moved from that apartment building Francis decided to be my second spirit guide and left the apartment. Joseph and Francis have been my guides now for 20 years. Both of them are still clean. I am very proud of them. They love the Reddit  post of ""You Know You're A Junkie If""..  They had me look that up so they could read it and laugh about the stuff on it. Drugs-Forum had the same post title. They got a laugh out of the posts on it. Funny enough, we can be out in public and they'll notice living people's veins and then try to ignore them. Either that or they'll make funny comments about them. Like the bald guy who was sitting in front of me on the bus who had a huge vein on the back of his head. They sat behind the guy staring at it the whole time we rode the bus! ""God, look at that baby!"" Joseph said with a laugh. Francis was staring at it. ""Could you imagine if he was a junkie and he was trying to hit in the back of his head?"" Francis said and then both of them were laughing. ""Use two mirrors so you can see what you're doing!"" Joseph said laughing. ""Like in one of those house of mirrors at the carnival!"" Francis said laughing. I looked at both of them and said  ""You guys shouldn't joke about him like that."" Joseph said ""Why not? He can't hear us."" I love both of my guides like two big brothers as well as best friends.

After 8 years of opiate use from the old school OCs to heroin I'm trying to be done with all this feeling like shit and being broke nonsense anyway enough of the back story

I was getting some fire dope, all chunk no powder like a white/gray/tan chunks.  Never had issues with it before! Long legs and could wake up the next day not feeling sick buuuut lo and behold I apparently OD the other night and Come to with my boyfriend standing over me while I'm sitting on the couch. Apparently I fell out about 5  minutes after I snorted it. I don't remember falling out, or him screaming my name or picking me up. Nothing nada zilch. He said I had a eerie shit eating grin on my face the whole time but a couple minutes go by and I come to! I have a decent tolerance to H so I'm suspecting fent. I middled for a friend who IVs and I was using with them and noticed when they drew up the dope in the syringe it was clear! We were using the same dope it came right out of my bag ? Anytime I've seen others shoot it always had a sweet tea looking color? The clear dope in the syringe was so strange and he felt the rush and loved it but giving the clear color that really made me suspicious? Anyone have any answers for why the dope was clear when put in a syringe? This was my first time over dosing prior and I've been snorting H for a few years now I could handle at least a half g throughout the day. My buddy didn't fall out but I told him to take it slow after my encounter the night before. But since the legs were long I didn't think it could be fent!?  But since I fell out I'm most certain it was cut with something strong.

Fuxking scary I almost died Monday night but by god I still wanted to finish snorting the batch anyway after I calmed down?  What kind of scary evil is a drug that almost killed me but I still yearn for it? Haven't used since Tuesday ... On subs and trying to stay strong.

The energy level is killing me. I try to get out of bed and shower etc., but as soon as I'm done, I'm exhausted. I try to switch the weed to sativa during the day and hold back on valium. It sucks because I lay around half asleep half watching movies and then at night I can't seep because I've sat in bed all day.

So, something had to give and I'm deciding that a break is in order not just for financial reasons, but also for health and mental health reason.

I am down to my last 2 bags.  I've snorted the reason and as I was about to snort my last few, I thought to myself 'Well, I still have my syringe, perhaps I could give it a shot (pun intended)'.

However, I have some questions/concerns.  Well, really one question.  Just how much water is needed for 2 bags?  I know the whole dissolve it in spoon/water bottle cap, use piece of cotton as filter, suck it up, access the vain, draw a small amount of blood out, then plunge away.  I've -seen- it done numorous times, by friends to themselves and friends doing it to me, I just never knew how much water was used.

The rig I have is .5 cc, used only twice so it's still in primo shape.  I would really like to get this right because the next few days/weeks are shaping up to be utter shit.  

I know it's late but I'm hopeful there are some helpful fellas out there in Opiate-Land.  Lend an unknown brotha-from-another-motha-and-fatha a hand and send him off to a drug sabbatical with a happy last night.

He does, so I hand him one, sit down next to him and ask if he knows where to get dope around. He goes, ""yah i know a guy with some fire!"" so he goes through his phone to find the guys number and we chit chat about how we use dope. I tell him i just got over being sick and my normal dealer wasn't around anymore and he felt pretty bad for me. Said ""I know what it's like man, so don't worry I'll help you out."" He gives me his guys number, and gives me the guys name and his name as well. I dial and say ""Hey *name* I'm here with *name* in front of *store*, he says you can hook me up with some dope?"" 

""Yeah man how much you trying to get?"" 

""Just two points not much."" 

""What? How much you got?""

 ""Just $20 man."" 

""Alright on my way."" 

So soon enough he pulls up and the guy I'm standing with says ""hey, that's his car, stay with my stuff?"" I oblige, hand him the $20 and watch him walk over to the car. He gets it, walks to me and says we should go somewhere else for just a moment bc the guy gave him a front but put it all in the same bag.... Whatever. 

So we move to where there's less people around and he takes the plastic off of his pack and starts pouring it out... That's when I realize somethings wrong. He starts telling me this is the best shit, it's so white.... This homeless dude doesn't have a connect for fucking China white. I ask if I can see it. 

""Of course this shit will keep you up for hours!!!!"" 

""Dude.... I wanted heroin."" 

We both look at eachother for a minute and kinda laugh. He tells me to call the guy again and hand him the phone. He explains what happened and we move to behind the store entirely to meet up with him, again. 

I got my money back at least, which is pretty cool because I thought I was just shit out of luck. It started getting dark by this time so I just gave up and went home.

I was with him for three years. I have never felt true devastation before that. Even before that bad things happened in my childhood - my brother was severely disfigured in a house fire and nearly died. I feel so damaged - I suffer from an inner voice which constantly criticises me. I hate myself so much. People tell me I'm beautiful but I never feel it. I guess opiates helped me forget how worthless I am - even if it is just for small periods of time. I don't know I feel like some opiate users just need that relief, without it they will crack.

Moreover he's friend with Putin, who choose to ban any maintenance treatment in Russia. He prefers to see addicts die while shooting Krokodil.

You're taught to hammer this self deprecating thing into your head over and over until it becomes your identity, you're the junkie. You're part of a niche cult that REALLY understands Kurt cobaine and gets it when ""junkie"" by ozzy plays on the speakers.

The best thing I ever did for myself to start healing was to shed that whole identity. I am not a junkie anymore. I'm a writer, a poet, I'm attractive, I own a home.

There are qualities in all of us, in all of you, outside the self destruction you started however long ago it was. I guess for some, drugs do just take over and you need that structure NA provides. I can't pretend to understand the success of it because I went a completely different route. I have been on the brink of suicide at least once a month in a very realistic way, and I realized I was the one damaging myself over and over again because it was so much easier than self actualization and following your dreams and making something of your potential.

After multiple edits this is as short as I could make the story without sacrificing too many details.

TL;DR at the end.

I'm 39 years old. Been using opioids periodically since I found my Mother's T3's and Codeine cough syrup at 13 years old. (neither of which she ever took because they made her ""loopy"") been shooting dope almost daily for six years now. In these last few years I have fallen out a handful of times. Every time I have been fortunate enough to have someone with me to either resuscitate or administer Narcan (Thank you Tracey for the care package. You have saved quite a few lives, even just in my circle.). My wife wasn’t so fortunate. She died alone 28 months again while I was serving a few months in County Jail on a probation violation stemming from a possession charge. 

Enough background. Last Tuesday, about one week ago by the time I post this, My best friend and using buddy came up with a plan. I had just gotten some 1mg Xanax and his new girl had just gotten paid. She was going to loan him the cash for us to get high if I gave her some Xanax. Cool, cool. So they show up at my place sometime around 8am, which is fine with me, but I don’t have anyone who will serve me before 10am at the absolute earliest. So we start eating Xanax like candy to pass the time. 11am rolls around and I start making calls. First call my favorite dude answers on the first ring! Huzzah! He says come through. Now I’m beyond stoked because though I have many connects this young cat has literally the best dope in my city, but unfortunately he also uses heavily so he can be difficult to deal with at times. More than once he’s told me to come through and by the time I get to his place, he’s passed out and won’t answer the phone. The past week he had been really bad about coming through, so I’ve been dealing with subpar Fent-cut bullshit.

We get to the place, call, and he shows up in less than 10 minutes. Holy Hell things are going smoothly! Fix up our shots and its just trash. By this point I’ve had 4mg of Xanax (waaaayyyy toooo much). I should be higher than a Georgia Pine. Still have a runny nose and trying like hell not to shit myself. So I call dude up, “What the Hell, Bro? This is trash. Your shit is always good.” He apologizes. Says he just picked up new shit, come back through. So after about 30 minutes he rolls up. I go up to his car window and he hands me maybe .4? Says, “Be careful Bro. This shits REALLY good.” Okay, whatever, never heard that before. Remembering just how much Xanax my partner and I had taken, I only dump about half the pack in my cooker. I fix up two shots, hand my buddy his and begin the search for a usable vein.

[BLACKOUT]

My next memory is a TV commercial for Rogue One saying “In Theaters Now”, or whatever. I’m thinking, wait a minute, Rogue One doesn’t come out until Friday. Open my eyes and realize I’m in a hospital room. What. The. Fuck. Then I realized that I couldn’t move my feet. That wasn’t a big surprise as I often sit on my feet and will fall out like that for hours. I’m trying to piece everything together and I call my mother. I guess my friend’s girl just thought we were passed out or whatever. She’s a tweaker, no experience with dope. So she just drove around waiting for us to wake up until about 11pm when she drove to my house, woke my mother up telling her she can’t get my friend and I to wake up. Moms knows I use and immediately had her drive us to the hospital. I’m told my friend and I are both ice cold, blue and completely unresponsive. It was daylight out when we picked up, so we were out for at least six hours before she decides to get help! This girl is no Rocket Surgeon. 

Thankfully I have no recollection of my Emergency Room visit. I’m told they had to use two intranasal shots and four IV shots of Narcan as well as putting me in a heating tent to get my body temp up 70 degrees! I had to wear these bootie things to aid circulation to my feet. After two days I was able to walk carefully. They gave me IV antibiotics every four hours in case of Endocarditis. But as it turns out I developed Bradycardia (a low heart rate). My resting heart rate is 30-40bpm while it should be 60-100bpm. So I’m sick from the intense antibiotic regimen, weak from what I assume is the low heart rate and in extreme pain from bruised lungs/diaphragm from so much vomiting.

However the good news is No HIV or Hep. C and, of course I’m still alive.

Like everytime I thought I hit rock bottom I found out I could crash right through it and find a new one low I didn't know I could reach!

I used opiates for several years but only a couple times a month. About 4 years ago I found a doctor who would prescribe 180 30mg roxies every 15 days. Kept that up for about a year with no issues until the office manager made him send me to pain management. They didn't fall for it there so I was cut off pretty quick. Moved to buying pills off the street but quickly decided heroin was more bang (see what I did there? Lol) for the buck!

So for the first few months I hid it from my wife. She had been doing pills all along with me but was against heroin. Eventually she found out and I took off. Instead of getting clean I got my own apartment, left her with the kids, and got high as Fuck since I no longer had to hide. After a couple months she gets the if you can't beat them join them mentality and I get her using heroin as well.

I had an incredible job since I was 23 years old paying $65 an hour. So we were able to do loooooots of dope. Unfortunately for me when I was off on my own doing heroin she told my family about my addiction. My dad happened to work where I did and told me to turn myself into work and get help or he would. I held him off for a few months but finally turned myself in.

I went to rehab and made it about a week before I said this isn't for me. Picked up heroin on the way home and went right back to where I was. 

Wife and i kept using. Work kept telling me to go to rehab or I would be fired. Finally in march of this year we went to rehab together. I made it all of 3 days before I talked her into leaving with me. Went on a few day binge and we went back to the same rehab. I think I made it 2 days before being ready to leave but my wife refused.

Once again I chose heroin over her and left. I was using more than ever before and didn't care. My job fired me for leaving rehab so I was really out of control with my use. I sent in a request to pull out all my retirement money and spent everything else in the meantime.

Could no longer afford an apartment and was living out of motels until my dad stepped in. He made me move in with them and get clean while my wife was in rehab. Except I didn't get clean, I told him I was while still using. 

Then my wife basically cut off all contact with me while in rehab. She gets out and says she is at her moms house. After about a week there they get into a huge fight and asks me to come get her and our kids. Take the kids to my parents and we get a hotel. 

I think all is well and am so happy to be with her again. Then after she passes out her phone starts getting texts. Me being the snoop I am look and turns out she has been fucking someone from rehab. 

We had been together 10 years and I was devastated. However I had bailed on her so much over the last year I felt I deserved it. So we work things out and I drag her right back to using..... Like the morning after I found out. 

Then we get my retirement money. Like 30 grand. We spent it all in a month on heroin, crack, and hotels. After that was up we had nothing. No home, no cars (repossessed), kids were with family, and mo money. 

We ended up homeless living under a bridge for the summer doing whatever it took to get money. I stole probably 30k worth of things from apple to pawn and buy more heroin.

After a little over a month she had enough and moved about an hour away with her cousin to get clean. I, once again, chose the bridge and kept using. Then in july I was arrested due to my thefts and spent a few weeks in jail. 

That finally cleaned me up. I spent a month at my parents when I got out and stayed clean. Once my wife was sure I wasn't using I moved in with her and my kids at her cousins.

We fall back in love and things are going great. Then I find out she had been using pills so I jumped in using them with her. My parents think we are clean and want to help us. So they rent us a house in that shitty little town and everything is going pretty good.

Occasionally using pills but our relationship starts to fall apart. She had been bartending at the bar in town and met another guy. One night we went to bed together and she snuck out to see him. I woke up the next morning and she was gone. She comes home around 11am and said she went shopping early. I knew she was lying so I left and got some pills and then got super drunk. 

Come home around 10pm and we get in a huge fight. I lock her outside while she is smoking and she calls the cops. She tells them I pushed her outside so I go to jail for domestic battery!

I spent a week in jail and she gets the house to herself to Fuck her new dude. I get out and we start working things out but I am staying at a friends down the road. One night I walk over and she is outside drinking with her friend and the guy she is fucking (I didn't know she was fucking him at this point). We talk for a bit and i leave. Turns out she left with him and our 4 year old after I left. That Friday night, about 3 days later, my 4 year old says ""I got to watch TV at tims house! Mommy was in his bedroom and they were kissing naked because she doesn't love you anymore"". Needless to say I lost my shit and heroin started sounding really good after several months clean from shooting up.

Since misery loves company I got her to relapse with me and we work things out again! Well the fun was over because the following month she is pregnant! Guess who had a vasectomy? Me! So turns out Tim knocked her up.

This of course makes me use way more. I again get her using because I wanted to bring her down with me. Then about a week later we are shooting up in a parking lot but she can't register. Takes her forever and someone saw her shooting up and called the police!

Oh and our 4 year old was in the backseat. So she gets arrested for possession, paraphernalia, and child endangerment and they let me go... So its just me and my son at home. She gets bonded out and moves back in with her cousin..... Who lives across the street.

My 4 year old sees her through the window and wants to go see his mom. I let him go over with my 12 year old stepson. I told my stepson if they don't want him there to call me or send him home.

Instead they call child services and my 4 year old is taken by the state for me 'abandoning him'.

Its been over a month since that happened. I am clean and today is 21 days sobriety. I get my first supervised visit with my son this Thursday and can't wait. I am so ready to turn my life around. I have lost everything these last 18 months.

I know this is crazy long but I have lost all my friends and just wanted to get this off my chest. I was sentenced to a year probation today for my apple store thefts and I requested to be put on UAs to help me stay clean. I still have my domestic battery charge to deal with... I think I can get through this though and I wont give up. Thanks to everyone who read this!

I don't use other opiates and I have no tolerance.

I let it sit too long on the stove and when I checked again all water was gone and there was only dried goo left, so I scrapped it off and it looked a little bit flakely. Than I put everything in two empty capsules and took both. The high was nice, a nice warm feeling and I think I slightly noded later on. I also took a Xanax and it was late.

But the day after was absolutely horrible. I had a really bad headache and I was extremly nauseous. I was also sweating really bad. I thought maybe I'm just dehydrated and drank a glass of water. But it wouldn't stay down at all and even a few sips of water made me vomit. I laid down and swallowed a few times, but I wouldn't stay down. Some time later on I was able to swallow an Ibuprofen and another Xanax. I somehow made it through the day napping and puking. The next day after that I was fine again.

Any idea what could have caused this? Did I not drink enough while high? I think the day after I drank almost nothing because it made me almost instantly puke and didn't eat anything either. If the dose was too high, wouldn't I have felt bad right after? Or is it possible that it took over 12 hours to reach the maximum in my blood?

I feel bad because when I quit back in August, it just wasn't the same so I had to unsubscribe. I felt like I was just giving hope to the people who wanted to quit instead of enjoying them myself. I would just get sad reading everyone's fun stories, and all the shit post of people venting (which is basically what I'm doing). 

I was doing great, but it was 3 to 4 months and I still was only getting 4 hours of sleep at night. I was also taking 4 or 5 shits a day, which sucked. I ended up getting some Kratom to help with everything, and it was awesome. I started sleeping again, and was taking 1 healthy solid turd a day. It didn't fuck me up so I didn't get that urge or start feenin really bad for opiates. (Yeah, DEA, I take it for an actual medical purpose, you assholes)

I ended up leaving my boring ass country town, moved to the other side of the state to start over. Quit my stressful job, got away from my crazy drama ass exwife. Met a wonderful girl. I just wanted to dip into my retirement and fish for the next year and rebuild my life. Its still great.... except I fucked up.

Last week, my new girlfriend had to go on a business trip and I was bored as hell at home by myself. I snuck over to the nearest gentleman club to hang out and get drunk. You meet the craziest fucking people in strip joints, and most of them are lying when they tell you what they do for a living, but its just entertainment to me. He was also letting me hit the bomb ass Miami coke he brought with him. I had a great time, I got his number, and went home. 

I called him the next day to see if he could call his guy and get me a dub of some girl. He picked me up and went to his guy, and came back out with girl, plus some boy, and it looked so gooooood. I pussied out (but I figured I deserved it for being so good over the past couple months) and caved in. It would just be this once. 

Got home, sat on the toilet, and did a shot. It was probably the worst H I've ever had, even with no tolerance. Well, I'm glad it sucked, because I didn't want anymore, and I took my gear and threw it under the bathroom sink behind some cleaning shit..... and then totally fucking forgot about it.

The girlfriend was cleaning the bathroom a couple days ago and found it. She was so hurt. I was her angel, the greatest guy she had ever met, and treated her like she was a princess. It blew her whole world. I didn't know what to do, or what to say. I had to even fess up and tell her I went to the strip club while she was out of town. I told her the whole story. 

Now she doesn't trust me anymore. She thinks I'm a drug addict and needs help. She thinks I've been doing it the whole time we have been dating. I've even put the little friend tracker location thingy on my phone because she thinks I've cheated on her by going to the strip club. Things just aren't the same anymore. 

I don't know how to prove to her that I quit a while back and that I don't want it even more. She has known about the Kratom I take, but never knew why. I mean, i'll always love drugs, but I will never go back to the addict life because of the life I lived. 

It was just that one time, nows its fucked my brand new life up. I felt I deserved it, and I'll always love drugs. I've just learned to control it, and not let it control me. I just love this girl to death and is the greatest person i've ever been with. Now i've fucked it up big time. 

I'm such a fucking retard.

Morals/Ethics/???s dilemma [LONG ASS POST],"So I am laying here, in the 'traphouse' I have been staying at the past month or two, stuck in thoughts, other peoples' opnions, hunger, and just general H addict-ry. This might be a long one so be prepared...

I recently got out of rehab (late July/Early August) and had a planned relapse. I moved from my mothers house in Northern California, to Oregon to go live at my grandmas house. Upon moving there my cousin had a friend (of whom would not normally be my type) who ended up being a 13-time felon, drug addict, in a  treatment program for her 13 month suspended sentence, as well as for DHS as the state currently has her child. We ended up (for some reason) getting together, she stayed on a trailer at my grandmas property, and I stayed in there for roughly a month in a Heroin + Meth fuelled bender, barely ever leaving the trailer except to do my college courses. (Of which I signed up for to show my mother i was going to 'change') 

Fast forward to the end of September... I have a steady dark hookup whom I have created a good friendship with, the female got kicked out of my grandmas property due to a variety of reasons. I continue my drug habit, and me and her don't speak for about a couple weeks. We end up rekindling the fucked up whatever-we-had and I ended up visiting her and we made up after a pretty big fight upon her getting kicked out of my grandma's. I stayed with her for quite a while, blowing off school, my job I just recently got progress slipping as I had no interest in anything other than her and heroin.. 2 or so more weeks go by, I have fully dropped college, fired from my job, and staying with her more than I am at my grandmas... and me and her get into a large fight. The specifics of which I do not really remember, but it ended up with her (a 6'2""-6'3"", 240 lb woman) whooping my (5'11"" 125-130 lb) ass... bad. I didn't retaliate which I wish I could have somehow (was going to snitch to cops, but have a warrant I don't want to get caught up on) At this point I am very close friends with my dboy, and the guy who owns the apartment/trap I am currently living in.

 After getting my ass beat I drive over to my guys house, unannounced, to calm down and get high (of course) I have been staying at their place ever since this all unfolded (which has been since the last Tuesday in September) without seeing her, really being in contact with my family etc.

So now the dilemma. I am laying in this dark room, starving, wanting really, really bad to get high. Ever since she beat me up I have not seen her, but she wants everything in the world to see me. Making up stories, saying she wants me to shoot her up (when she is almost 30 and never touched a needle, while we were together she was 'deathly afraid' of them) all just for me to come spend time with her. She has a lot of money right now (which is true, I know she has her own hustle and makes a good deal of money with it.) and said she will buy me dark, buy me food (which is honestly what I care the most about.. I have been trying to get myself a pizza, or sandwich, or ANY FUCKING THING ordered to me. I am starving.. and my friends (dboy + apt renter) obviously don't want me to see her after what she did to me. But I want to see her so she can buy me some grub, get me high, all that nice jazz that I want myself and most all of us junkies (term of endearment, I swear <3 ) want in our active addiction.

So I guess my problem is just; 
Should I go through with it let her buy me dope (which would be at least a ball) and food (which again, is the main thing I want.. I am starving and there is literally no food in this house right now that is substantial that would fill me up?)
Or should I have some pride/self respect/self esteem/all that shit and not interact with her with all of the shit she has caused in my life (which is a lot more than posted just don't want to write any novella-length texts which this already seems to be)

Please, please, PLEASE give me some guidance or direction in my case, whether it is just your 2 cents or just blatantly telling me what to do. I am starrrrrvvvvvving, and just want to get high as shit (not dope sick) and this seems to be clouding my judgement. I want to thank all of my b/r/opiates for the love this community shares and in advance for any words of advice/things I should do in advance. I love you all <3",1482300310.0

I have a question for those of you that pretty much only blow your DOC (oxy). I am curious if anyone ever does a line and for some reason it is incredibly painful, makes your eye water on the used nostril side, and the pain seems to radiate from behind your eyeball. I believe it depends on what pathway /turbinate is open in my nose. Sometimes I'll do a line and it goes right back to my throat (no pain), some times it doesn't go to the back of my throat and just goes up there and doesn't hurt, and very rarely it will do as described above. In fact, I usually get really messed up afterwards when this happens, so even though it is very painful I kinda like it bc I know I'm going to feel really good after the pain subsides. I can usually tell when this is going to happen bc when I inhale (thru nose) prior to doing anything it just feels sensitive. Has this ever happened to anyone before? And no, it's not from an irritated membrane it's def going somewhere different but i just can't figure out why or where.  Also, it is not just one side that it can happen with. It's happened with both nasal passage ways before.

Has anyone had a really bad reaction to suboxone?  Did you ever figure out if it was the buprenorphine, the naloxone, or both?  Did you have a better experience with naloxone free subs?

What happened to me was terrifying - basically it started out with some serious coughing.  I smoke my shit and this roughly felt like that scratchy, hair in your throat feeling that you can get if you haven't smoked any in a while.  My coughing intensified until I was throwing up every couple minutes and having trouble breathing.  Finally I started more or less choking on this thick foam-like substance coming up from my stomach in massive heaves - the foam was so thick though that I had to practically shove my hand down my throat and scoop it out to breath.  Eventually I was convulsing and turning blue from lack of oxygen and after feeling like I was in the middle of the worst asthma attack of my life for 30 min to an hour (and I've been hospitalized for asthma many times), I was able to get down some water and recover.  At this point I was feeling drawly and crawly but terrified to take more subs. 

This happened 3 times before my doc decided to believe me and give me a script for oxys.  I convinced him by showing him the scratches and burn-like marks on my throat from the foam and my hand.  

Has anyone had anything similar? Or any other sort of reaction?  Up until the time my boyfriend saw this himself, he didn't believe that this was from subs & instead thought I was making excuses to go on pills - but it happened within 10 min of taking my subs each time and seemed to end with me rejecting the subs and going into withdrawal.  I'd love to hear if anyone else experienced any adverse reactions - for my own piece of mind and to provide a record for anyone else going through a scary reaction.

The gist was that I woke up in WD's after having nothing but some methadone the day before (not much). Yawning, stretching, restlessness, etc. This was at 3:45 am. Managed to get to sleep until the alarm went off but felt like I hadn't slept at all.

I had zero dollars and nothing insofar as side work planned or scheduled. My guy (guy A) has a guy (guy b) that has a guy that's going to the doc today and doing the prescription boogie we all know and love.....we are all just waiting on the dude to fucking finish and come over.

Turns out the guy B is someone I know and, behind my guys back, he asks me to come over after the initial transaction.

The short of it is that my guy (guy A) doesn't know that I deal with his guy sometimes and would shit bricks if he found out. I get access to a large amount of percs tomorrow and guy B (his guy) wants them instead of the blues (his wife likes them better) and wanted to pay me in blues ahead of time for the percs tomorrow.

Okidoki!

Long story short(er), he gave me 4 blues towards the percs tomorrow.

I have been using the same goto Dboy for some time now. Probably let's say close to a year. Quality has ALWAYS been good and only had problems with weight a couple of times. So I'm comfortable getting a couple of eight balls or half an ounce or whatever without worry about getting screwed on quality. The dope comes in solid rock form and is very solid so it looks to me as it's straight off the brick. So I did my pickup yesterday as usual and everything is good except 1 thing has my concern. (btw I both bang and snort) So what has my concern is that when I snort I go into the nodds really without much effort at all. 1 line is enough to make me nodd, which not only isn't usually the case but I feel like the euphoria is not matching up to the nodd. Typically I have to do a few lines and work up to the nodd. Now if I'm just nodding off of 1 line because it's some fire ass shit than that's totally cool. But I'm concerned that maybe there is some Fentanyl in the mix. IF so it's probably not my guy adding it but one level up before him. So does anyone know if any ways to tell if there is Fentanyl in the mix? I've never ever had this concern before with my guy but I'm just sure that this time there is somethign different. It could just be fire but like I said the nodds just come on too easily and I don't feel like the euphoria matches the nodd.

Any tips or advice regarding how to tell if there is Fentanyl in the mix will be greatly appreciated. Hopefully I am just being over paranoid and I just have some fire ass shit! LOL :-)",1482278722.0

5jpf7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5jpf7a/questions_about_opana/,7,https://redd.it/5jpf7a,TrashEater666,Questions about Opana,"So I'd bet  similar things have been asked before, but I'm not entirely sure. 

I got my hands on some generic opanas, the ones that are easy to snort without gelling up. Previously I only had access to the Endos, which were basically useless. Now I have these right in front of me basically, but I don't know what to do. 

My use has basically been at a low point. I take Kratom everyday, usually at least a half O, just to stay sane. Prior to that I was at about a 80mg a day oxy habit. 

When I do get my hands on pills now, it usually takes about 50-60mg of Oxy to get me to nod hard, but 30mg to get me feeling nice. 
With hydro its about 70-80. 
I realize that these doses are fairly low, and are much less than what I was accustomed to at the peak of my use. 

My question is, should I even attempt to use the OxMorphone? I know it will be much stronger, and only plan to insulfate about 2.5mg at a time, but I'm still worried it might be too much. I know the kratom has kept my tolerance from completely dropping, and I cleared through 130mg of Oxy in 3 days earlier this week (with a strong effort to space it out), but I still don't want to get into this if there is any chance of me overdoing it, even on this amount. 

Second, other than potency, what is the difference between Opana and Oxy? While it's hard to resists (and obviously even if you guys tell me not to, I still might), I'm worried that trying it once or twice might just make things worse. Is it much different in terms of being that much better, and therefor producing even stronger cravings and associations with its use? 

Sorry if this doesn't make sense. I just really want to indulge in something, then go back to Kratom for a good while, to allow my brain to chill for a minute, but I dont know if the this is the best means to go about that. 

No matter what, I plan to use pills. There is no convincing me otherwise. I just don't know if I should choose Opana as something to jump back into it.

In someways its seems better, as I feel like they are much more likely to be legit Pharms than some blues. In other ways, I worry, as I don't want to open myself up to a whole new world of shit (even though this is probably a one time thing in terms of getting my hands on these rare lil dudes). If i got them, my plan would be to stretch 4 10mgs out to at least 8 highs. But I also don't want these to ruin all other pharms for me in the future. 

My other option would be to just hold tight, fight the cravings and wait for blues and hope they are legit. Dont want to go the H route because fent has run rampant in my city lately (same reason Im hesitant of thinking that waiting for blues would be much better than just grabbing some pandas.)

First, the dealer didn't have enough for everyone and I was only getting 1p out of the 4 i needed so I could go out on my bday without having to schedule my time around the inconsistency that is heroin pick-up time.

We do our hits. It's new stuff, my first hit from the new batch and I realize it kind of looks like fentanyl. It's like bright orange in the cup and it hit me really hard, made me all sleepy. I didn't quite realize the impact it had on me and others until way too late.

We find out later we can go across town to pick up the rest. I go with David since it's on my way home. I see him get into the car and I go over to the metro to wait for him. 30 mins goes by. He has my phone so I call him 20 times and there's no answer. I have my MacBook Pro with me so I go on iMessages and text David's roommate who tells me he's already back. What the hell?

I take the last metro back there only to find out he's managed to trash the entire apartment, pass out totally naked on the couch, face-down, with you guessed it, his dick on top of my phone.

He doesn't remember the trip there and back and has lost the money and/or dope. I'm mad and I go next door to Tim's. Tim tells me he thinks someone gave him acid. I ask him if anyone is still open (it's 1am now). It takes me until 6am before I realize he thinks it's 6pm. It's now my birthday and it sucks. I'm sick as a dog and my methadone is at home. Our lazy dealer finally shows up at 4pm for our morning pick up. I buy 2p. I still need 2 more but I have no more money. I do the 2p.

Things start to get blurry here.

Our night time pick up was going to be at around 8pm and before I know it it's like 5-6pm already. I somehow talk my mom into coming all the way there with cash. She drops off the money and goes back home. I go back to David's to wait for heroin time. Apparently everything I said made no sense. So we pick up and I do another hit. I FINALLY get to leave for home. It's probably like 8-9pm when I leave. Now shit gets weird....

It took me 4-5 hours to get home. I totally blacked out. And this is a 1 hour TOPS public transit trip home. I kept blacking out and missing my stop on both the metro and bus. While sitting on the metro out of nowhere while I was sitting down, I lean forward with all my weight and bonk my head on the metal pole. This would leave me with a bruise above my brow that would stay there for a week. The inside of my lip also split open. I finally get off at the right stop and get onto the bus. I miss my stop a few times, and end up at the end of the bus line a couple times too. When I finally get off the bus driver kept asking ""are you sure this is your stop?"" but no it wasn't my stop and that was the last bus and I look for my phone, as I'm unlocking it, it dies. I manage to flag down a taxi and finally get home at 2am.

And in all this, I somehow manage to not get raped, lose anything, or get my phone and/or computer stolen.

I continue to do the weird shitty blackout dope until it runs out and our guy changes it a couple days later.

In retrospect, Tim wasn't on acid. He was on the not-dope dope. And David's weird behaviour is also explained by this too. David apologizes and vows to give me my money back. He eventually pays back the entire debt.

When I finally started putting the pieces of those 2-3 days together, I realized that whatever drug I did made my brain cloudy and it made me forget huge chunks of time. It's hard to describe the feeling it gave. I literally felt as if my IQ had gone down by a shitload of points. like there was a fog in my head that made it hard to think. I remember being so afraid that this would be permanent. That it wouldn't go away. That the haze would be forever. It took a few days for that feeling to be gone in its entirety.

I say sure but your gonna have to throw gas money cause we're literally out as wont make it. He agrees and thanks us. So first he lies about where we have to go. Saying its 1 mile off this exit...then when we get there he says oh it's like 3 miles down. So we get closer and then he goes oh wait it's actually 14 miles. I'm like really bro we aren't gonna make it, but he insists he has a gas can full of gas. So we get there, and this kid comes to the car and hops in. The gas can had maybe 2$ worth of gas in it...if that. Then he pulls out two Starbucks gift cards as payment for the dope. Wait so u got no money bro? Naw I'm sorry just 35$ on these gift cards. Wow dude ok your a piece of shit for lying about everything so I take his bag and empty 3/4 out of it and say take it or leave it now we have to find a food lion to sell this gift card to the coin star machine. We finally find a food lion but no damn machine. Fcked. So we pull out and bam we run out of gas. Now we're broke and out of gas about 35 mins from either of our homes. Time for a 2 mile walk to find. Gas station and a kind hearted soul. Thankfully we get to one and this guy throws is 5$ for gas. Awesome then this kid asks us to buy him beer and we tell him yea but u gotta drive us to our car. Nice. Now time to find a food lion we can sell the cards at and get more gas and cigarettes before headin home. Every machine we find doesnt work. Fucked. So now we're about 2 miles from my house and my boys still 20 miles from his. Cars puttering outta gas, but we make it to my house. We brainstorm how to get him home and come up with nothing. He says fuck it he gonna go to a close gas station and try to ask someone to help him out. I really hope he made it home okay. Of course we were lookin around my garage for a full gas can I thought we had before he left and my folks come out thinking were stealing shit from the garage. Fucked. Lol tonight has been a fuckin trip from hell. Did I do something wrong to deserve all this bad karma coming my way? Fucked isn't even the word anymore this whole night has been a cluster fuck of bullshit. All because this stupid fucking kid couldn't just tell the truth, and got us all fucked up.

I had started to develop a taste for opiates the summer before I got this job and I applied for the job solely to gain access to drugs. It was a free for all. I stole thousands of pills from August 2006 until they finally caught on in late March of 2007. The pharmacist, being a close family friend, really put his neck out for me and agreed to subject himself to many years of intense scrutiny from the feds and state just so I wouldn't get in any legal trouble. I had to write a confession and go to rehab in order to stay out of trouble, but I could have been in major shit. I owe that man so much.
But yeah, I tried any and everything. I even found an old apothecary bottle in the basement with about 4 grams of pure cocaine hydrochloride in it once. (Wow) I mainly just took oxycodone preparations. OG 40's and 80's. Lots of Dilaudid, also. Thankfully I wasnt an I.V. user at the time. Once they knew something was up I quit cold turkey and suffered the most intense week of withdrawals ever. It was hell. I screwed up my brain chemistry pretty bad that year, I feel like. I haven't been able to get a handle on my opiate use since. In and out of rehabs and jail. I really regret everything I did at the time in my life.""

so how did YOU make the transition from casual user to dedicated opiate addict. fwiw I'm currently making a serious attempt to clean up for good. haven't used anything in about a month and have been on suboxone for a week now.",1482386103.0

Recovering heroin addict here. Had almost half a year clean and I slipped up recently, and it's led to using a twice more. Three uses in six months isn't so bad but I'm scared it's gonna snowball.
One of the things I've been doing to deal with my addiction is going to the gym. This helps massively with my self esteem and overall sense of well-being.
There are times when this isn't enough. At those times, a dose of about 5mg of etizolam is enough to make me absolutely forget about heroin.
Unfortunately I feel like the times that I resort to using etizolam have become more frequent and the ugly truth is this:
Heroin is a drug with a horrible stigma but opioids are one of the safest drugs at least in terms of damage they cause to the body. So long as you don't overdose (or have naloxone handy, which I do) and aren't alone, the only really side effects are constipation and a diminished sex drive. Everything else comes from using needles especially dirty ones. The simple truth is snorting heroin is not particularly harmful. It is not neurotoxic like methamphetamine nor is it cardio toxic like cocaine
Benzos are a tricky subject for me, and I'm starting to realize if I am not careful I could become a daily user, and the simple reality is that benzos are a hell of a lot more damaging on the body than opiates (not to mention the fact that I'm using a research thenodiazepine) and the withdrawals from a benzo can literally kill you.
So I'm thinking because I'm not blessed to live in one of the sensible countries who have a heroin-maintenance program policy, I should find a RC opioid and use that instead.
One of the amazing things about RCs is how cheap they are. I get a dose of etizolam for 10 cents. On the street the equivalent would be about 5 dollars. So obviously if the pricing would hold true with opiates I could be a daily user and not have my life in pieces. That way I would still get all the positive effects of my heroin use without the negatives (insane cost basically making me completely broke). Most studied opiates are relatively harmless (again, unless you overdose). I am aware that some of the RC Opioids are not so safe, like M45 or whatever it is called can be quite dangerous.
I think I would be best with a morphine derivative, methadone derivative, or last hope is a fentanyl derivative. The latter would OBVIOUSLY require volumetric liquid dosing in order to not guarantee death.
I was hoping you guys could give me some input on what the better RC opioids are and if they are around on the clearnet. I am NOT looking for a source mods, I just want to know if they EXIST.
I've heard U 47700 is the shit, but it's been scheduled so it's not something that would be obtained easily.

I am aware of the potential for poppy pod tea, but I don't know how great it is, if it's worth the time and effort and if it's really expensive.. The goal here is to find something that is much cheaper. my heroin habit was costing me 500$ a week on a good week.. suboxone is 50$ a week but an RC could be something like 5$ a week if I found the right one. 
Thanks for your time, thanks for listening.
You are all beautiful. You are all worth it.
Any advice at all would be extremely appreciated. :)

Regiszering and blasting off is so easy in that one, downside is that it swells a bit (the vein) and makes my foot itch and tingle.


Other vein, prolly safer: when you tie off around the biceps and extend your Hand as if to shake w/ some one else, you can have your thumb point downwards. At this point, you should see a blue line on the back of your thumb, which then continues to follow along the wrist etc. This vein is small and think, but easily hit. It does hurt a bit afterwqrds and comes with some swelling though.

Just thinking a lot about drug laws. I think most drug users can agree that all drugs should decriminalized meaning the user can't get charged with anything, only the seller. And most would say that a lot of drugs should just be fully legal and taxed as well. I just wanted to get your perspective to see how you would think this would play out in the opiate community. Obviously it would be dope, but do you think more people would use/less people would quit with easy and safe availability?

She was having a hard time at the moment. I myself am a chipper and partake in most things I come across. I love Subs and benzos (as long as I don't drink.. you know) However I've stopped drinking because that was 5 straight years hell, being on it every day, fucking up, getting ill, getting right, making mistakes, blowing all my cash on alcohol and crack and hurting people that I never in my life would think of hurting.

After travelling for a long time I'm back at my parents in order to kick the drinking everyday-bit and stay away from all the temptations so I can get my head on straight. get sober, get a license. I've had a few opis and benzos in the last while but spaced out and nothing special really, just to curb the cabin fever I've been getting. No worries.

Any way, she quit heroin a while back and has been staying with us for 4 nights since we met. Then se got herself into recovery living busted out after a week and started staying with her new actively using and alcoholic new ""boyfriend"" and... you probably guessed it, he breaks up with her and goes back to his ex. She arrived at mine yesterday with fucked up self inflicted cuts on her legs that I've been bandaging and cleaning. Starting to look a bit infected though, so I fear I'll have to call the hospital soon, which she doesn't want to cause she'll probably get sectioned again.

She's crying all the time, saying she wants to get some gear, for me to never leave here, making me promise impossible shit. reaching for her meds in order to slam as many as she can, acting like a toddler, having tantrums etc. Saying she will kill herself, her ex and her mum. gave her a phone when she moved in, she slams it against a wall. I'm calming her down, trying to motivate her. Holding her down till she calms down. Give her some of what she actually is prescriped and then hide that shit so she can't find it.

I'm trying to do good and be understanding, just like people have been with me when I've been a total fucking mess but she is getting on my fucking nerves. She guilts me into sleeping in the same bed even though when I'm sober I fucking hate having people next to me whilst trying to sleep. Wants to put her hands on my cock, wants to fall asleep with my hand on her tit. Wants to spoon. I tell her you can sleep in here but dont touch me girl i've got a will on my own and just to fucking listen or it isn't gonna work because I literally can be up all night if theres someone else in the bed. and you've got a guest room I've made up for you. She says she'll cry all night and cut herself again if she's alone. 

Sorry about the rant. I'm trying to be patient but damn she is getting on my nerves. And I don't really know her that well. She's got a lot of mental issues and depression and a terrible self esteem. Shits bad man. Anyway, I'm not sure if im an enabler or what because I do try to do what I think is best for her and motivate her, whilst nabbing a bit out of her stash because fuck it, I like those piills too. (sub when she's got it and benzos she's prescribed)

That wound on her leg is gonna get mad infected. I've seen bodily harm cuts but she's peeled layers of skin off along with deep cuts. I'm probably going have to call the hospital so that shit doesnt go septic. Section or no section. Don't really know how to motivate someone when they've dug themselves this deep. I've been in a sort of similar position but at that time ""give it some time youll feel better""

Should i continue on Suboxone 16mg a day?,"Hey guys, long time lurker, once or twice poster but I really respect the opinions of those on this board and I would like some advice on a predicament I'm in.

TL:DR at the bottom but please read if you can

Up until last Saturday I was doing a lot of heroin. Thankfully I never IV'd but once I was introduced to a heroin dealer through a coworker back in about august I spent an enormous amount of money on heroin. 


It began with $120 grams of pretty good ECP that would last me the night and about half of the next day, and after about a month a gram would only last me one night, and then i would finish the gram at 8 PM and be left wanting more.


I bought my first 8 ball of heroin for 300$ and was amazed at how much tan-brown powder was in the bag. I remember I felt like i would never be able to finish it. 


Spoiler alert: I finished it. 


It was an amazing weekend but soon more and more of these 8 ball bingers followed. By November I was buying an 8 ball of heroin for 300$ every 5 to 6 days.
I guess you could say I was a a wannabe chipper because i would binge for 3 days and then save money for the next 3 or 4 days so I could do it again. 


Here's the weirdest part though, I've never gone through noticeable withdrawals. For the past 2 or three months my usage has for the most part looked like ""Buy 3.5g of great quality ecp and binge on it for 2-3 days and then go without for 2-4 days until i can save up 300$ to buy more. I don't know if its because there are always (usually always) a couple days between my binges or if i somehow have some genetic mutation (much less likely I know) but I have never gone through withdrawals significant enough for me to say to myself ""holy shit im in withdrawal"". 


However the financial aspect alone convinced me to quit heroin. It was unsustainable. I eventually began transferring 300$ from my parents Chase accounts to my own (I'm a piece of shit i know) every couple days to pay for my 8 ball. I found their banking passwords in a binder in my dad's office. The combination of them both making good money (both engineers) and the fact that they don't think anyone has access to their accounts but them has allowed me to get away with this shit for a while but every time I do it I just feel like the biggest piece of shit on the earth.


Anyway, about 2 weeks ago I made the decision to quit. An 8 ball of heroin would only last me 2 days and wouldn't get me anywhere close to the level it used to and I realized this was the point where every junkie is forced to make the decision to either get help and quit because the lifestyle and financial aspect of using heroin is sustainable, or to say fuck snorting this shit, and grab a needle and don't look back. 


I made the decision to quit. I had done a huge amount of research and came to the conclusion that Suboxone was my best bet. It would get rid of any withdrawal symptoms should i experience them but even better, after taking it, it would render all other opiates useless. This meant that every time I felt a craving for heroin I could pop one of these films under my tongue and picking up heroin would be pointless. I found a doctor on www.suboxone.com and had an appointment within the week.


Everything was in cash and after all was said and done I think I paid the doctor about 350$ for a prescription of 60 8mg/2mg suboxone strips a month of which I am to take 2 films a day; one in the morning one in the night.


Now i've been on these films for about 3 days now and I'd like to share my experience briefly before i get to my question that this whole post is about!


When I place the whole 8 mg film under my tongue and let it dissolve i feel very little. Like I said before I have no real withdrawal symptoms from the heroin so the suboxone does not heal my dope sickness or anything. I do feel a little bit better in mood and sociability while on the suboxone (on a good day suboxone will raise mood from a 4 or 5 to a 6 or 7) but I dont feel any ""opiate"" like effects such as euphoria, body itch, etc.




If you have read the whole thing up until now, thank you so much for taking an interest in my story, it means the world to me that someone i've never met on a board on the internet would go out of their way to help out a complete stranger.


TL:DR/MY QUESTION FOR YOU ALL!


The doctor prescribed me 60 8mg sub strips a month and I want to know should I take them as prescribed (8mg morning/ 8mg evening) to completely get heroin out of my life, or should I only take a strip when I feel tempted to buy heroin because I have heard that subs can be incredibly hard to get off of and I don't plan to take them forever.


To me 16 mg of Suboxone a day seems like a lot and I don't want to be able to ditch the heroin habit only to replace it with an addiction to this pharmaceutical.

What do you think /opiates?


Thanks so much for helping me out yall really are the greatest community ever!

My mother and my little brother (""little brother"" is actually a long time family friend/my best friend who lives with my mom) died last night/this morning, and it's my fault.

So here it is: yesterday I called my mom, several states away, to have her send me my Christmas gift a little early, which was $100, via either Western Union or MoneyGram. I planned on using $20 for food/bills, and the other $60 for dope, which is my daily dose. Yesterday I was having a hard time scrounging up money for dope, as I had spent what I had on bills/food and Christmas presents (I'm not like, super poor or anything, just a struggling college student with a shit job, and I sometimes fall back on my mom for help when I need to). So I decided, since I already knew my mom was just planning on sending me $100 for Christmas, that I would ask for it a little early so I could cop and get well. My mom agreed, and my little brother (who is actually just a kid I met when we were in grade school who's actual parents sucked so he moved in with us when he was in the 6th grade and I was in the 9th) decided to drive her to the store so she could send it to me, as he helps her get around the house and with chores and what not while I'm away for college (which I could't afford to come home this year). 

So last night around 7:15-ish, my mom said my little bro, L, was going to take her to the store to send the money, and my L sent me a text basically saying to have fun with the dope I'm getting (he uses too, we both keep each other in check). The store is only a 5 minute drive away from them. I never heard back from them again. So for the next several hours I was progressively getting more and more concerned. Must have called each of them 50-100 times each. I sat up all night, dopesick and super worried. It wasn't until about 3 hours ago that I got the call from my uncle that they had gotten in a wreck. The story right now is that someone blew a red light at the super busy intersection and T-boned my little bro's car, killing my bro instantly, and putting my mom in critical condition, which she fought until something like 4 or 5 this morning, when she finally passed away.

I just can't believe they are gone. I know it's not really my fault, I'm not like suicidal or anything like that, but at the same time; I feel responsible. I just don't know what to do right now. I've tried calling every dealer I have begging and pleading for a front to at least take away the sick, but nope. 

So here I sit on my couch, in my incredibly small studio apartment, an orphan at the age of 26, emotionally shattered, incredibly dopesick, and the absolute most alone I have ever felt in my entire fucking life. And so close to Christmas, like, why did this have to happen? My mom was my favorite person in the world. She was loving, caring, and even quite understanding of my addiction- not that she supported it, but she watched my dad struggle for years with heroin before his eventual suicide; so she knows it is cause for some immense and deep pain. She took in my little bro, no questions asked, and treated him as her own. And L was my very best friend. He was the only person I felt like truly got me. And I lost both of these amazing people.

PS: I'm sorry if this is difficult to read or understand, I'm having a hard time with just about every single little thing right now- I can't stop bawling, which makes typing and focusing a tad difficult. ",1482468135.0

(Beware: Enormous Essay!)","Pre **TL;DR** Yes, this is rather an epic thing that just poured out of me today after another experience with a doctor I begged to help me get some sleep... after nearly 3 weeks now without any. I even had to go in with a parent to prove I wasn't drug seeking. He gave me ONE 10mg Temazepam. This is the point I always lapse. The mental aspect for me is almost worse than the physical.

If you want the gist of this rant, just watch the YouTube link in the middle. This whole essay is about the prejudice we as addicts face both in using and in trying to seek help. There are some of my opinions and experiences here and I would like to hear yours too. All in all, there isnt much hope, but times may change.

-------------------

There was a recent question here about how old people who visit the opiates sub are. I admit I was surprised that there are some very young users on this forum that may still have family looking after them, a job, perhaps some income or a student loan. Many people here may still be living 'the dream' before it all comes crashing down. At which point, how long it takes an individual to realise that they have a problem that isn't solved simply by saying 'well, that's it, I'm done'. It doesn't work. It haunts you. Obviously the younger folk may not have had the time or experience to discover just how long trying to quit can go on for... you may want it, but it's a fucking battle and the ignorance you will encounter and platitudes you will be offered along the way make it that much harder. Doctors, police, health workers, the public even your family, may be turn against you even when it comes to admitting and seeking real help. 
   

Not to be patronising, it's just a fact. The younger you are, the less developed your viewpoint or opinions related to this entire war on drugs, the related punishments involved and experiences with the available help may not be. As time passes, one thing will become evident as it has for me, you will learn of more and more of the propaganda against users, against drugs and of the invented divide between those that do and don't touch drugs. Alcohol and tobacco, scientifically shown to be the worst in terms of cost to the state in damages, helping the weekend drinkers who can't handle it, the diseased livers later in life.. they're fine, they're advertised as a lifestyle choice. Sophisticated even. Worse of all, the seemingly ludicrous punishments and deterrents that work about as well as a 'No junk mail' sign on a front door! Non violent drug users receiving jail time equivalent or greater than murder or serious offences to make an example to those that, frankly, are so wrapped up in their own problems, wouldn't even be aware and never even consider the laws they are breaking every day just to continue using or stay out of withdrawal.
  

I personally have suffered addiction for nearly 8 years and while the good high times are few and far between, the majority of it has been a living hell. I've put my family through it all with me and almost caused my parents to near divorce over their arguments stemming entirely from me (those talks parents give their young kids when they say 'it's not you, it's us, but we will always love you' well, that doesn't apply here. It IS my fault. On top, I've borrowed and stolen countless quantities of money - all wasted. Sentimental things sold off, swapped, pawned etc. £ 800k - 1 million EASILY. Not to mention 4 or 5 expensive treatment centres that did nothing for the illness, just a lot of therapy trying to implant unhappy childhood memories which i never had, I loved my family and growing up with them. Let's just say, whatever the answer is for addicts, it isn't 'talk fucking therapy'. At least for me. And lumping everyone into the same boat is equally as useless.



The reason I believe age is a factor in the responses and opinions I may receive is that, for me, it took nearly five years JUST to even begin to move past the denial of thinking I simply liked drugs to... oh shit, I have a real issue, after all, I've lost everyone I ever cared about, my business, my friends, my home, my savings.. Perhaps... Perhaps I'll just stop and get my life back.. to..   

 
OH SHIT.. this is entirely beyond my control. I cannot actually stop myself. I am physically, emotionally and mentally compelled to disobey my own rational thinking and to do something so stupid that I am not only putting myself in danger, but I even know I will have lasting consequences that aren't worth this brief high. If I steal my parents credit cards, I know they'll find out in a couple of days, but right now, this second, nothing matters but not feeling mefor just a moment.Living in guilt, shame, and feeling misunderstood and outcast, mentally I tend to live in the past when I had friends, I didn't abuse drugs and AI had prospects. To even get a life back now I would have to claw my way, unassisted out of a huge bottomless pit.   

Apologies if this is long, I'm just trying to set the scene. I had to realise myself that this is such a bigger, such a monumental problem involving deep inside my brain than it is a lack of willpower. I justified it in so many ways to myself and others (what is it they say... the left and right brain have functions in the story of your life, the left brain interprets your actions into a narrative. If what you are doing is irrational, you'll still have a poor excuse as to why you did it)   

My internal core programming, eat, sleep, reproduce, has been hacked. And deep down inside me, I believe I simply NEED opistes and that I will scheme, scam and steal my way to achieving that goal. And unless you are an addict, you cannot understand that compulsion. Well, thank god for modern technology, as brain scans from nerurologists, ask anyone in any rehab if they think anyone of them wanted to end up there, the reports from psychiatrists and doctors specialising in addiction they all unanimously agree - it's a mental illness. You just don't get any sympathy for this particular illness. Cancer would have been silmpler. Then everyone around me would of understood it.

My cause now, is to educate as I go, as I encounter people who ask me about it - and I am op n and honest about my addiction. I try as best I can.  

  
 Just as homosexuality was illegal, people were hanged, locked up, persecuted and in hiding, unable to tell a soul their true feelings, finally I feel we have turned a page, we are just waiting for the older generations and their disgusting ideas to die out before we can all move on. The same goes for slavery and racism, although in places it still exists, the tides have turned there too and at least we now acknowledge it is a crime to treat our fellow humans any less simply for the colour of their skin.  

I guess this is all on my mind because recently I've been trying to get clean. I had to tell my parents before they moved in that's i needed to have no access to a phone, to change all their security on their banks, the safe code, take the house phones away.. take my money and bank card, literally everything i could think of while I was in that determined state. As time went on, the intensity of the pain, withdrawal, mental anguish etc got bad, real bad.. I won't go into detail, but I STILL found a way to escape a locked house, get enough money and score, without transport, without phones etc. Addicts are devious, deceptive and damn resourceful when needs must. Well.. wouldn't you be if you related the craving feeling to the same part of the brain that tells you that you need to drink water and eat to survive.. it Becomes an imperative, prime directive for addicts!
  

So, what help is there? In my experience, less than pathetic, fuck all. The best we got is substitutes or vivitrol to stop you relapsing. Righ, so nothing for the underlying anguish, turmoil, anxiety, cravings. It's no wonder people kill themselves, the cravings aren't their for the drug necessarily, they're there so you don't have to feel what it feels like to be clean. Some people do get clean and love it, others never feel right and is part of the reason they started in the first place...


This is my story of going the official route for help (I have since had better results ordering things I have researched do the dark web, Inhave also had Ibogaine treatment, naltrexone, suboxone, a benzo prescription and four different anti depressants and have also complete 5 long term (3-6 month rehabs..) I guess you could say I have 'treatment resistant addiction'! I'm certainly on one end of the recovery bell curve)- 


    
So, I went to the doctor 8 years ago for my addiction, seeking help right at the beginning. Not only did the doctor do nothing for me, my withdrawal, my lack of sleep..the usual symptoms. But once I had admitted my problem, after I left with nothing but upset and anger, it all went straight into my personal file. Every time I have a problem since and see a doctor, the first thing they see is that note - addict, drug seeker, heroin. After all these years, the conversation begins, 'how is the addiction', from that moment on, their mind is made up and I haven't been able to get any medication for ANY illness whatsoever (including anything that is entirely non-abusable like antibiotics or muscle relaxants for sciatica that kept me screaming in pain for 6 weeks in bed) Now, since because I am labelled as a 'drug seeker' I get. I help for something that I need more help for than the average sick person ever will. It is my opinion f on this experience, I should Have never bothered asking for help. It has also affected my employment, my benefits, any government money help for not being able to get a job or work when I've been in the throes of a lapse. Honesty hindered my chances of getting any help whatsoever even for unrelated issues later on. I got blood poisoning once and before I could get the IV antibiotics that would save my life, there was a deliberation about giving me those drugs (I was lying on the floor of A&E dying, and they called my parents to check it wasn't a ploy) In case you're thinking that's a bit overkill - let me also add that zip am not known to the police, have a clean record, even a clean driving license with no speeding or parking fines whatsoever. This is entirely a prejudice medical issue.

I attempt to educate people whenever their is opportunity. I can and will forever argue for addicts to be seen as suffering and that are sick individuals that need help.
We addicts feel an entirely irrational urge to repeat an activity in which they are receiving no 'high', just more misery and yet are unable to stop - I often cite people, such as my hero, Professor David Nutt (an extremely well educated man with impeccable credentials as a neuropharmacologist that was hired by the UK government to investigate and report on drug dangers and inform them for new policies - and so, after publishing one of the most vigorously investigated studies on illicit drug dangers and of addiction as a health issue - the government simply fired him because the science didnt align with the policies they wanted!!)   

  

I suggest looking into Professor Nutt, he's a great man, intelligent and I feel he is on 'our side' in terms of drug reform, punishment and changing the entire failure (and increasingly getting worse) policy on illegal drugs and users. Even if coming from a scientific stance than a moral one, he still makes sense.
  

  
Despite having available evidence (and increasingly, families have they own experience with an addict in the family) the general public still struggle when it comes to choosing to understand it - bombarded with years of propaganda (Nancy Reagan anyone?)
The first thing is that they have to overcome an entire belief system which has been cultivated by media propaganda, government service announcements and certain people within the public eye that do an entire disservice to a subject of which they know fuck all about (I feel we are seeing this mor and more where celebrities in the limelight decide to jump on a bandwagon and campaign - For example, those against children's vaccinations, believing them to cause Autism. Let's not forget the twitter accounts from anti science celebrities claiming the earth is flat and NASA has been pushing faked images of space for decades!)
  


Russell Brand (love him or hate him, he is currently our only 'people's champion' when it comes down to raising 'Trew' awareness of an epidemic that is affecting a huge percentage both here in the U.K. and America on the growing epidemic of addiction. He recently revealed the report on the overwhelmingly positive success of more than 10 years of decriminalised drugs in Portugal was suppressed here in the U.K. Our politicians refused to even acknowledge it, believing it isn't a conversation worth having)


Are any of you aware of who I would label as the 'arch nemesis' and public enemy number one of rational thinking people and addicts everywhere? The man in question - Peter 'compassionless cunt' Hitchens. Goddamn I hate this man.. (Get this for arrogance - You may know of his polar opposite brother, The late, great Christopher Hitchens - As Peter is a full on a Christian, he decided at his outspoken Athiest brother's funeral, instead of saying goodbye and delivering a heartfelt eulogy, to do a Bible reading over a personal goodbye - Ending it with some quip about getting into Heaven. Basically, he wanted the last word over his dead brothers outspoken atheist views)

  
Despite being an asshole, he has a career pushing his views in a popular tabloid here in the UK and is often on television being asked to voice his opinion on addicts and addiction. If you made it through this long rant this far, then the only takeaway I'd like for you is to just watch a couple minutes of him in action and see it as a stereotypical stance of the sort of thing addicts are facing in order to be seen as vulnerable sick people lookimg for aid.

Whilst Christopher Hitchens was the champion of rationality. His brother rides his coat tails with his own agenda and views. He has no compassion, his views are guided not by education and rational thought, but because of his idiotic belief in god, what others see as a health issue, he sees as moral failings because of course 'we all have free will'. Well sir, let me tell you, the brain is not as simplistic as that and our animal instincts still pervade much of our desires and thoughts whether you believe it or not, we are only one rung away from lesser creatures and the power of language doesn't make us immune to irrational impulses.
 

He is a true example of the higher ups, those with media influence and an apparent educated grounding. I would kill to debate this man in a public forum, win or lose, then just stab him in the car park outside. How dare he speak on the matter of people suffering with mere opinion as his basis for fact. This is the level  of ignorance and prejudice that people with a mental health issue have to face which I believe filters into the health system as well as government. 

  
I just think, it is no wonder that people fall between the cracks and never seek or receive help - especially when the idea is constantly pushed upon them that it is their fault and why should they be h loved.

This is my personal experience of seeking help, guilty, ashamed and ignorant to just how ill and how much pain I would have to endure to come close to being clean - I mustered the courage to see a doctor for addiction. That was 8 years ago - seeking help right at the beginning of my problems. Not only did the doctor do absolutely nothing for me, for my withdrawal, my lack of sleep, suicidal thoughts, the pain of it all.. the usual symptoms- by once I had admitted my problem, it went straight into my permanent record in my medical file. It would follow me everywhere from that moment on. Since then, every time I have a problem and see a doctor, the first thing they ask is 'how is the heroin addiction', from that moment on, their mind is made up. I haven't been able to get any medication for ANY illness, any pains, broken bones, other mental issues (I won't go into, but suffice to say we're life threatening) nothing whatsoever. I was off limits medically as far as they were concerned. Amazingly, this included non-abusable medications like antibiotics or even muscle relaxants for sciatica that kept me in bed screaming in pain for six weeks) Now forever labelled as a 'drug seeker', all in all, I wish I had never bothered asking for help - it genuinely hindered my chances of getting any real help for even for unrelated issues.


Dealing with our personal problems is only one side of a multi faced issue. Let's face it, on top of our emotional baggage, we must face the publics perception and stigma often rising to actual hatred and discrimination. For example, only last week was a new documentary on BBC about a group of guys in Manchester that were sick of the homeless problem and drugs that came with them (Not all homeless people even use drugs, but the association was enough for these people, they had formed a group that actively roamed the streets and were burning homeless people's tents and belongings believing them all to be  'junkie scum'. At the end of the show, they all bought some coke and were doing lines on camera. Asked if this was a little hypocritical of them, they replied no, because in their mind there is a definite hierarchy of drugs and drug users with opiates at the very bottom, where only ill educated, morally corrupt, no good scum use them.  

And I guess that about sums up my thoughts for tonight.  I want to see a future of change where people do see it as a mental health issue - and goddamn, I know from my own experience with my family that it is selfish and it looks like you only want drugs and fuck everyone else, but ain't have real feelings and I care about people and my life, hobbies, interests, I want a partner, children a family of my own. Instead, I have compulsion to commit a slow and painful suicide with no delight or pleasure to be taken in it whatsoever.
  

I'd love to see doctors get it right. Research, funding, studies. It's already proven WHAT  it is using brain imaging. But are the pharma companies that are undoubtedly creaming off the cash from diverted pills and medical insurance paying for billions upon billions of pain pills prescribed? Addiction has become a lucrative industry, just as war profiteering is. Is there any desire to help the 10% or so with this issue? Or is it too small of a problem. Despite more than 90% of crime related to addicts trying to stay well? The waste in taxpayer money fighting a battle that can never be won..   

The UK BAN on 100% of psychoactive substance that can be bought online and legal synthetic weed in head shops just 6 months ago has already (as I predicted) been an unmitied disaster, with multiple times as many hospital admissions than befor the ban (legal meant labels, doses, purity) it went underground and now more people are dying than ever before.

When is enough going to be enough. Think of the money saved, th and innocent lives saved simply caught in the crossfire of the drugs war, Mexico for example has become a daily massacre over profits and production. 
   


Bottom line; I want to feel understood. In my fight, in my battle for a sober life I no longer want to be judged for the pain I feel and am trying to correct. eventually I want to be able to live with myself - not feel that I am so depressed or anxious that going back to opiates seems like a genuine solution. I've changed doctors multiple times, but as my file travels with me, their answer is always the same - go away - or, talk to a psychiatrist for your anxiety disorder. Yet, The condition I suffer from that didn't mention earlier is severe hair pulling and skin picking - entirely not drug related, it is anxiety related. And it is so bad that I am covered in terrible scars. 

**TL;DR** Yeah, I know, it's a long ramble. But please just watch the YouTube link in the middle if nothing else. An example of the sort of prejudice addicts have to face and overcome if we are to ever get help. Real help. It is a problem I honestly cannot believe is a moral failing or a choice. In the long run, mainly to the individual suffering it, that it is clearer and clearer a mental illness. And that there a little to no genuine solution except parking popl on a substitute. And that it is being brushed under the carpet by politicians, probably due to the immense pharma profits.

 Opinions, experiences? Perhaps you've locked yourself away and never really come into contact with telling people the truth. You're content right now, but are you honest, or do you hide it? How do you really think people would react to letting them all know you use Heroin and you're not likely or unwilling to stop. If it's working for you right now and your savings, job and life are predominantly intact, good for you. But there comes a time when it doesn't, when money is tight, when your friends notice a chance and don't come back. When the time comes to ask for help, I hope for all our sakes, the world is ready to believe we aren't just selfish amoral hedonistic assholes. Godspeed and much love to you all! ",1482454256.0

She had been clean off H for about two months but had been taking bars of Xanax (I found out after reading her FB messages). They found her with two syringes and an ampule of something the cops couldn't identify. I feel guilty because I had told her she might be able to visit me in CA for Christmas but pushed her tickets to January because I wanted to go to Mexico that weekend. Now I'm not in Mexico and my sister is dead. I'm trying to deal with her death and I have questions for users. 

What could that ampule have been? She mentioned in a message that she was going to get an 8 ball. 

Was the Xanax use part of the reason she decided to use again?

What do you guys experience after months of sobriety that dives you to use?  She had been begging to borrow the car, and even though my parents watched her, she still managed to get drugs. 

I don't think she wanted to die, but what sort of thoughts do you have in those moments? 

Why use so much when you know you have no tolerance? She had a suboxone script but I'm not sure if she took it that day. 

If she had decided earlier that day to use, and I know she did by her messages, was there anything I could have said to stop her?  Have any of you had that experience? ",1482447081.0

I keep reading posts from people who are saying that their doctors have all of a sudden cut them off from pain medication.  I have also read and responded to several threads from cancer patients, even metastatic terminal cancer patients, having trouble getting sufficient pain relief from their oncologists.


I know that the DEA\FDA or the various US based medical societies have updated guidance to doctors about when to prescribe narcotics and how to be more diligent about confirming patient medical issues\diseases and corresponding pain and pain levels however nothing I have read that has been published has said to just take people off pain medications just because.  They have up scheduled several narcotics as we all know however they have never told doctors not to treat people with verifiable issues and associated pain properly.  They have never told doctors to just pull people off of pain medications cold turkey without providing a taper plan and the medications necessary to follow the taper plan.


So I have been thinking that it is only a matter of time until a doctor gets a malpractice suit filed against them for something like this.  All you need is a patient that can prove they did everything by the book who had their doctor actively treating them for an easily conformable medical issue\disease.  I am talking about a patient that has an absolutely confirm-able medical issue\disease causing pain that requires the medical treatment with the narcotic and\or non narcotic medications that the doctor has been prescribing and this patient has followed all the doctors instructions. (no failed drug tests or missed appointments, etc., nothing at all that would give this doctor a justifiable reason to pull the patient off)


If the doctor cuts them off for no valid medical reason other than wanting to not prescribe narcotics they are causing that patient unnecessary harm if they do not properly transition them to something else, someone else, etc.  If they just cut them off cold turkey and cause the patient to not only now suffer pain from the pain caused by their known medical issue/disease they are also forced into medically defined/known withdrawal and the pain and suffering that comes along with it.  If the doctor does this and does not provide a valid reason for doing it along with a proper and well documented taper plan and prescriptions for all the medicines needed to complete the taper or continue to provide the medications the patient is on until they can get into a pain management practice and begun being prescribed and this is confirmed by the original doctor (not one of those ""I'm cutting you off in 30 days no matter what"".....actually giving the patient time to find the pain management specialist or even referring and ensuring their patient, their customer gets on medication from the pain management specialist) they are directly causing harm to their patient\customer in multiple ways.


I have to imagine what I have described above has happened many, many times over almost exactly as I have described.  Thoughts out there friends?  Do you think that there have been a lot of medical malpractice suits filed for events like this?  I know generally they are settled and the settlement comes with a gag order so we may never hear.  Do you think they will be coming soon now as this issue escalates in the US in particular?  Has anyone seen a widely publicized malpractice suit similar to this or been involved in one?


I have to believe they will be coming if they haven't been already.  If this exact thing has happened to you why wouldn't you try to get a lawyer to take this type of case on a standard contingency basis.  I know that doctors get sued all the time for far less verifiable things they have done to cause patients harm and lose or settle those cases very frequently.  In many cases like I have described we could be talking about patients that this exact doctor has treated them for many, many years for medical issues\diseases that they themselves have documented as chronic.....they would have very little defense in terms of being able to say that the patient no longer needed the medication that they themselves determined they needed and prescribed for years on end.  They, defense wise, would also likely have to be able to prove that they did this to all patients of theirs in similar situations which I doubt is generally the case and would open them to additional liability in doing so, in my opinion.  Especially for a case where they cut them off and don't transition them.  Sorry for the long post, I wanted to get all my thoughts on this on paper so to say.  Again....your thoughts?",1482438912.0

After much deliberation I have come to the conclusion that what was happening was that I was just getting higher and higher. I'm sorry for wasting your time. 

Tldr: 1yr smoking veteran got some heroin that actually gives me a huge rush. Looks, burns, tastes and smells as it should but gets me high as fuck.

I recently got my grubby little mitts on some powerful heroin and only when I got about half way through my gram did I realise it was hitting me like a ton of bricks! I have a pretty decent tolerance (0.4-1.0g smoked daily) which is why it's made me seek a second opinion.

I'm only bringing this up now because I'm getting a bit paranoid I'm gonna hit a hotspot or something. I'm a smoker so when I get a batch that stands out I immediately pick up on it.

I put a bit about the size of a small pea on the foil, sniff the residue from the little coke spoon I use and smoke away. Not long after about 2 hits all of a sudden I get this huge rush where I'm euphoric (maybe anxiety lol) my eyes start rolling and I can't keep my head up so I go to lie down. Also during this time I forget to breathe a couple of times. After about 10mins the intense rush passes and I'm no longer soaring with my eyes in the back of my head I'm just...high.

5jrpvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5jrpvt/i_like_to_play_scrabble_and_im_a_failure/,7,https://redd.it/5jrpvt,theexchangedoc,I like to play Scrabble and I’m a failure,"My favorite game as a little girl was Scrabble. After I learned the basics, I would sit for hours putting together words in hopes of beating my dad and uncle at the game. My mother could only take me away from the grid and tiles with promises of my favorite food or threats of a spanking. I was a four year old with a competitive spirit unlike any other. Soon the game became something else for me. It became a refuge of quiet and safety. 

My parents went deeper and deeper into their addictions. They enabled each other, used together and burned the life they had built to ground all while me and my siblings were caught in the middle. When my dad would come home drunk and high after hours at the bar, my mother (high as a kite) would be at the door and ready for an all out brawl. I’d shut the door to our bedroom and play Scrabble with my brother and sister. Most nights they would sleep through the screaming and furniture breaking and I’d set up the game myself singing whatever classic rock song I had learned that week. Eventually my parents lost custody and then...I grew up. 

The Scrabble obsession continued as I became a stronger and stronger student. I realized I liked to write and tell stories about anything and everything. It landed me scholarships and to my family’s disappointment I chose film school instead of law school. While studying there, one day I got a message on MySpace (yes that used to be cool). My dad’s brother reached out. After 12 years of not a peep, here he was in black and white saying through his brother that he wanted to reach out since he knew I was an adult and could decide whether to see him or not. For some reason, I took the bait. Years passed and yes I was in touch with my dad all over again. He continued to abuse alcohol and drugs (even in my presence) and it was clear that things were getting worse. 

Meanwhile, I was still trying to kick ass at telling stories and traveled to Chile with my college to film a documentary on an archeological dig. I met this public health student named Deanne. She had an infectious laugh and drank a lot of wine so she was an instant friend. We remained in touch and she asked me to edit together some footage she had shot for a public health class. The footage blew my mind. I edited interviews she had conducted on harm reduction: a program in New Mexico that supplied communities with sterile syringes, the overdose reversing drug Narcan and other services to prevent the spread of bloodborne diseases and overdose fatalities. I had no idea this program existed and knew that no one I knew had any idea what this was. The desert landscape and the interviewees who clearly had mileage on them were a story that had to be told. I was hooked. BUT I was penniless, barely making rent and knew I would have to dive into this possibility when I could pay all my bills.  

A few years pass. I’m working day jobs in television production and trying to find time to have a social life but also become a full time documentarian. Not an easy task. One morning while I’m on set, that same uncle who had Myspaced me, called me and said my dad was found dead in his apartment in Michigan. Heroin overdose. He was 49, penniless and alone. I screamed because I was powerless. My good friends Allyson and Vanessa took me out to lunch that day, bought me a drink but I couldn’t say anything. 

A few years pass. I’m working full time. Burned out. Depressed. Lacking a creative drive and documentaries were in the past. That same friend Allyson, who knows me too well says “Layla, what do you want to do? If you could make a film about anything what would it be about?” A cheesy but honest retelling of events. I was dumbfounded and began telling her about harm reduction, Deanne and some of the details of my father’s death. The tiles on the board had been laid out. This is where The Exchange was “conceived” so to speak. 

Today I’m in the midst of the storm called fundraising. I’ve gotten permission from New Mexico’s Health Department to film the grit of harm reduction in their communities. I now have two subjects named Phillip and Sonny who have lived and breathed harm reduction for decades and their ready to be filmed. My team has gotten a fiscal sponsorship to keep our paperwork tidy. I now have now written 27 tweets (that is a lot for me). I’m trying to spread the word about the film and now am faced with the the possibility of my first failure in the project. I launched a Kickstarter 22 days ago and now I realize how naive I was. Now I have 7 days to go and $13,000 to raise. But for some reason, I’m okay with it. Its part of the movement. People like Sonny and Phillip were told no day after day but now they save lives every day and have changed legislation in their state. Not only should this story be told but I have to tell it. I want to tell people about something that could have saved my father. I want to tell people about something that could save a kid that gets into their parents meds or an old woman who took one too many pills. Or maybe that teenager that broke a bone, was given way too many pain meds, didn’t get their script filled and turned to heroin when there was no turning back in their disease. People should know about harm reduction like they should know about a cure for cancer.
Even though the odds are stacked against us when it comes to this Kickstarter hiccup I like to call it, we have a plan B, C, D, E ...you get the idea to not go away. I encourage you to stay tuned and maybe play a bit more Scrabble.

I HATE this stuff, and I don't believe it's in my head because it's different because I have never had any issue with the other subutex generics I have had. I honestly just assumed they are all the same, but this seems to wear off way faster than usual, and doesn't work as well. I told my dr this and they raised my dose twice, which didn't really help. I know about the long halflife and I have never felt like this before. I wake up with muscle aches and sweaty and sneezing over and over. I usually slept 12 plus hours, I wake up around 3 am now (take dose at 7 am) not feeling great, go back to bed until 5 when I wake up sneezing and miserable. I thought I was just sick for awhile until it didn't go away. I went on vacation and had to fill my script at another pharmacy and ended up with the white ones with the sword and had no issues, i didn't even think about them being different and slept through the night and when I woke up feeling normal my husband said ""hey! you slept all night!"" I got my meds to take them and noticed they weren't prefibin. I read somewhere that generics can vary, and my pharmacy is a small family owned two person business with a pakistani husband and wife who told me they just order what is cheapest. I don't know if I am just experiencing something unrelated and my dose really does need to go up like they keep suggesting (getting bumped up again another 2 mg on the 5th)

does swishing mouthwash with alcohol and spitting it out before you place the tablets in your mouth really help availability? What about the other chemicals in mouthwash? They don't coat the mouth and make it where bupe wont absorb do they? I did search this and got a lot of conflicting shit, mostly about sub films. Some say it wont absorb, some say it helps, and some say that it doesn't work and you use alcohol.  Do you find it makes any difference?

I taper off of this next summer. I just don't want to wake up feeling sickly anymore and I'm fustrated that I can't find whats happening. I have a doctors appointment for a check up tomorrow to see if it's something wrong with me.

And I have my first drug test coming up in a few weeks. I'm a heavy opiate (heroin) user, but I am prescribed Suboxone. Unfortunately I don't take it much because it just doesn't really help with my sickness..I know if I did use it regularly it would be better..

But anyway, my PO told me that if I am prescribed an opiate medicine like Vicoden, then I need to bring in the medicine so she can verify it and (possibly) count the pills to see it's correct. I'm assuming that would excuse you from peeing dirty for opiates.

My question is, since Suboxone contains an opiod (bupe), if I used heroin and came out dirty, would they know the difference between illegal street drugs and Suboxone strips?

I went to a place called FastTest labs and they said that an expensive 85$ test can tell between synthesis opiates and street ones. I know the PO's office uses a 10$ test because that's what they charge you.

I know it would be better to be safe than sorry, but I'm just curious if anyone knows definitively. I'm not expecting to be able to get high the entire time I do my program, but just knowing that if I do slip up that the suboxone will cover me would be nice. Thank you if anyone knows..

Ive never done a true speedball, but went ahead and prepped a shot. It's maybe .25 of tar, and about a point of blow. I'm quite excited for this shot, but am a bit scared at the same time. I tried to not use enough coke to over power the dope, which I think I succeeded in. The blow is *great* but so is the tar. 

On top of all of this, I've been doing some lower dose Klonopin (I have a tolerance to opiates and benzos) through the day. Maybe 3mg in total, and last dose around 4pm. 

I just wanted to make sure this should be a relatively okay shot to take. I'm plenty hydrated, and even been eating. The coke is so clean, it has practically no come down, allows me to eat, and has great euphoria. 

I realize none of you are doctors, and can't give me a solid answer. Lmfao. But I do think I'll be fine. I've done 3x+ the amount of blow over the course of the day, that I've loaded in this one shot.

Ill be doing the shot in 10 minutes or so.. So please respond! Just to ask how it was, if I'm okay, or whatever else you'd like to ask!

5k14ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5k14ck/cwe_eureka_moment/,2,https://redd.it/5k14ck,CYPROXY,CWE - Eureka Moment.,"***Fair Warning - This could be very long-winded. I tend to be on the verbose side when talking about this stuff ;).***

So, I have other posts regarding the cold water extraction of oxycodone or any opiate from other adulterants present in the pill, primarily acetaminophen, or APAP for short and I have mentioned that so many directions for CWE entail first using warm water to dissolve your pill matter into and then chilling it prior to filtration.

I never could understand the reasoning behind it. Strictly going by the numbers, namely the solubility of APAP and the solubility of Oxycodone into water, you can easily and safely use regular tap water for the process.

Without getting *too* deep into the numbers, here are some stats:

- **APAP - 14000mg dissolves into 1 liter of water or 14mg into 1ml of water (25 deg C).**
- **OXY - 100mg dissolves into 1ml of water.**

In short, we can use the barest of minimums of water to dissolve our oxy but we can't filter paste, can we? It has to be something we can filter easily and to slightly complicate things, for every ML of water we add, we also add 14mg of APAP.

I did some rough estimates and when I CWE, I use *about* 100ml of water. I've never measured it. Just a decent guess.
That said, I'm drinking, **at a minimum**,  1400mg of APAP per extraction, provided I don't use more or less water than 100ml.

That isn't a great number, 1400mg. It's a **safe** number, though, but it could be *better*.

One of the problems with using less water is that it takes a lot longer for the pill matter to dissolve. I tend to throw the pills into the cup of water and forcibly stir and agitate the water to get them to dissolve faster. I don't always have the means to crush them first (I do this on the road in the car sometimes). One thing I noticed is that they tend to dissolve very quickly and the stop entirely. All that's left is a little, thin, sliver of pill that doesn't want to dissolve.

Then it hit me. It's not dissolving because the water is almost saturated. Adding even a tiny amount of extra water to it makes the slivers of pill disappear almost instantly. You're giving the APAP somewhere to go with the addition of the new water.

Then it became clear to me - you use warm water, to force as much APAP into as -->**little**<-- water as possible! I just used about 30ml of warm water, dissolved 8 percocets into it (quickly, I might add), and put it in the freezer for 5 mins.

I then filtered the cold solution which was a **third** of the amount of water I would normally use, btw, and the resultant liquid was damn near clear. I was amazed! My solutions are never ""clear "" - there's 1400mg of APAP in there...of course they aren't *clear* but *this* solution had, roughly, 420mg of APAP in it and was MUCH easier to filter as there was just a lot less water.

***The Takeaway***

I am still amazed at how little water I was able to use and how clear it turned out. Granted, warm water isn't always available, on the fly, in the car, but for every other instance where I'm at home, I'll be using the above method.
Using a ""dissolve warm, filter cold"" process:

***Bullet Points***:

- Results in less APAP in the water provided you use a minimum of water
- Dissolves pill material faster
- Results in clearer liquid
- Less water to filter
- Faster Filtration times


I don't expect to get any PMs on this but if you *Do * have questions, hit me up. I love talking about this stuff.

After 3 years of active heroin addiction, I've decided I'm going to try and get on a maintenance program of either subs or methadone in 2017, I haven't decided which yet. I have 3 months of long service leave at work, so that should give me some time to try and adjust to whatever I choose to replace the H with. There has to be something more to life than spending year after year lying in bed getting high and watching movies. Hiding from all the pain that sent me running to dope. I can't afford it anymore and it barely works anymore, either.

I had 49 days I believe I don't really feel much of anything this is the longest I've ever made it off opiates tho. I feel like I can get back on this horse and do the whole sobreity thing over again. Im sure that people are thinking that I have a far path and im barely even in this thing. That's totally true but I want this and im happy about the way my life is going. Not now since the relapse but since getting sober. A lot of my friends started to want to hang out with me more I could tell and i finally started to feel happy with myself and was starting to like the person I was and was beginning to act confident somewhat in myself without the opiates. Im just scared and kinda want to know if anyone can guess of 3 days of PST will make me withdrawl set back the depression or anything like that. Please any advice would help so much. I know to stop right now but what should I expect. I know you can only guess but your guess is better than mine. 

Before this I spent the last 3 years on 12mg/day suboxone I was prescribed and then often spending my weekends shooting a gram of ECP in 48 hours. Im just scared for withdrawling again when I got off of subs it took me a month to feel better again. If my withdrawls are even close to that bad idk how I'll be able to do this and continue going back to my job. 

How bad does PST cause you to withdrawl again? Like Im guessing there is somewhat of a difference between drugs that you take and effecting you to become dependant again like I imagine it takes herion much less time than it would codeine. Also im worried because PST lasts soooo long I drank it 3 days in a row in the morning and was pretty high 24 hours of each day. The first day I washed a pound of seeds and holy shit that hit me hard. I actually was shocked and overwhelmed. Clearly i alreeady got dependant as the same dose the next day didn't have close to the same effects. 

Thank you for any advice you can give on what i should expect or maybe on ways to also handle it as best as possible. Taking a sub taper would not be needed at all correct? Is there any straggles that do help after short relapses or is it best to just stop asap. ",1482655901.0

Little background I've been addicted to heroin for about 5 years now and have been shooting since January this year with about a month, not even, of some kind of clean time via rehab. Well needless to say I relapsed the day I got out ok... Fast forward to the end of november, still relapsing hard. So My Mom sets me up with the health services in my area(the toe of the big ass boot look in thing on the map) and put me into an ambulatory detox and then IOP with a suboxone prescription and I only pay 10 dollars for 14 strips, a weeks worth. So I'm like cool I get in there do the detox but j never commuted to it like the second day I put the strip under my tounge and then swallowed it whole(do not try this at home) so I could get loaded that day. So after the detox we have to see the doctor once a week and get drug tested and come to group 3 times a week where they random test you. No big deal, my Patna from group actually takes his medicine and was more the. Happy to give me some piss for a few tests being he had his own clean, but still dirty in all the right places, urine. So ever since I have this stockpile of subs I've been telling myself that I can just have fun while I can afford it and them just jump back on subs. Well..everything ran out tonight right after midnight. My boy finally comes through after having to call him every hour and a half to make sure he doesn't forget because not only do I have to go do family fun day early in the morning, but I did two fat shots of meth about 20 hours ago and have already went through a little more then a half a gram dope since this morning trying to shake this comedown which I can't seem to do but getting this dope for the morning and being able to do a little shot to help me sleep completely changed my mindset. I was literally suicidal until I heard that phone ring and when it did, I skipped my ass down the street like a giddy little school girl. But basicly this past month of December I have probably done at least 6 or 7 grams to myself in 2 1/2 weeks. And it just so happens the day I really need to not be sick is the day I run out of all my money and all my hustles.

I recently got my hands on 15 Vicodin pills (5/325). I pretty quickly used 7 of the pills in about 2 days, but with 8 remaining I faced a lot of anxiety about the indecision of how to get the most out of my remaining pills. Took 15 mg  probably a week after last using, and that was enough to make me feel great. 
Now, I have 5 pills left. I haven't used in a few days, should I take all of these at once? Or will that make me feel sick, although I haven't felt sick prior to this? Should I take 10mg and then 15mg later? And most importantly, how do I get more of these magic pills! Lol. Thank you all",1482644577.0

Edit:
**I feel like spreading some junkie harm-reduction love today!**

 I know some of you have trouble getting syringes locally and I'm genuinely saddened whenever I see a post about someone having to reuse needles an awful number of times. If you're in this situation, please PM me. 

I will order a box of 100 syringes for the first 5 people to contact me. They're 1mL insulin syringes available in 28g 1/2"", 29g 1/2"", and 30g 5/16"" so please mention your preferred size. If you're uncomfortable about sending your info, use [temp.pm](https://temp.pm) to make a self-destructing note and PM the link. 

Update: Spots still available. Also, I got a Visa gift card from a relative and I can't spend it on drugs so I'll open up a few more spots if need be.

Praise JJ","I'm having a str8 up splendid day and have no one to share it with. I went and raked and bagged leaves all morning and afternoon for my dope $ then went to get my dope. My dboy cuts his shit thinking he's slick (he's not) and I have no one else left i can go through since I'm not mobile. It's so lame he gets above average dope then steps on it making it str8 up garbage and I usually have to ride with him to the city to get it so he can use my money with his. He gets him and his gf high on his own supply. I used to front him my $ since we re friends but he would always take his time serving me when he got back instead of 1st thing. I know that's inpatient and all but sitting there waiting sick sucks ass (like I really needed to tell you all that lol) and when id show up at his house there would be ppl leaving he'd just served before me so now if he needs my $ I have to go along so that way I stay a high priority on the to-be-served list. So today im talking to him about how bad I just want some decent dope for today and tomorrow and how shitty his awful dope is etc and he tells me his plug has ""fire Xmas dope"" and tells me to take his word that it's fire and not do anywhere near my normal amount. I started getting my hopes up which is something I try very hard to never do. He tells me a dozen times over the course of the trip to be careful which he never does since he knows I've been doing this for quite a while. On our way back he even makes a detour so we can get a bag of new rigs! I know that probably doesn't sound like a big deal to many of you but it's hard to find them here and I'd been using mine for months. A long ugly horrid dull as shit rig. We got back to his place and he hands me a nice big beautiful chunk of ecp and I walk home to do my shot (we live in the same neighborhood and his gf won't let anyone do shots there). It was indeed fire! I've been nodding happily ever since and I have plenty for tomorrow. I'm sure it wasn't really ""fire Xmas dope"" and that he just didn't cut it Ike usual. Maybe bc his gf got her first paycheck and $ isn't quite as tight as usual or maybe he did it for me for Xmas idk. I did bs him a few times lately and told him I already got dope from someone else when he'd call to see if I needed any but really I was just broke. I don't want him to know hes the only plug I have atm. I have no one I can share this with irl so I thought I'd share it with you fine folks. I know this is a long pointless shitpost but I'm super happy dammit. Merry Xmas fam I hope you are all well and jj smiles upon you.

Stayed with OXY for a long time,  bit much like the rest of you, the cost of pills caught up to me. Moved away from home to get away from D( I'm way to paranoid to cold cop) and have been ""clean"" for over a year. I say ""clean"" but I'll still pick up a few bags when I go home to visit. But I haven't touched H in my new state. I have had minor access to low dosage trams, perks and oxys, but not readily and definitely no connect. But I'm a daddy these days, and I've seen the depths and damage this specific addiction can do to people. So no D in FL. But.....Yeah when I'm home I'll cop some for the week....Speaking of which I'm going home in 2 weeks, and Ima get good that week. 


Anyway enough about me, I've been lurking this subreddit because I've seen the absolute most amazing people here, constant ly sending words of encouragement, or just being a shoulder to cry on for someone in need. It just shows that this community of druggies,junkies and addicts is really a community of people who care for one another, who look out for each other and may even be the reason someone decides not to put that extra bag in there shot tonight.

I have been so dopesick that I have simultaneously sucked dick, while getting fucked in the pussy, while having someone suck my dick. And that only got me ONE heroin so imagine, I had to repeat the process 600 times that day just to get my fix. It was a low. 

You think you're a junkie? I robbed the Mexican cartel 4 times while living in California, completely wiped out their heroin stock and that only lasted me a week. You don't have a habit, you're a joke.

Been lurking here for a while, haven't been sure of how to start getting involved in this community. Since September when my father in law passed away, shit has gone downhill for my SO, his mother, and I. She is disabled, addicted to pain meds/ heroin for over 30 years, SO and I just stick to the blues as we usually get them for free/ low cost from MIL. We have come very close to being homeless in these past few months. MIL sees a pain management doctor who prescribes her 180 blues a month along with 60 oxymorphone. Since FIL died we have been struggling to pay for her dr appointments and scripts, since she has been in the process of switching insurances. 

The fucked up part is her old insurance, which covered everything no copays or premiums, was canceled before her new insurance kicked in. The only way we have been able to get her pain meds filled is by getting people to front the money. In return they have been getting really good deals on the blues which unfortunately led to the scripts not lasting the whole month.

SO and I usually go on ~2 week binges, at the end of which we taper off so we don't get WDs too bad. But MIL has such a high tolerance from decades of using and of course she isn't able to do the taper. So she ends getting really sick, depressed, and along with all the other BS we are currently dealing with, it makes things incredibly stressful. I have a lot of sympathy for her but most of the time we don't have the money to keep her well because we pay the bills and food costs. She is waiting for her disability to kick in too, once that happens we will be set but it's really difficult right now.

However this morning we went to pick up her blues script, expecting to have to put out $180 (most of which was borrowed) and the pharmacist said there was no cost! After all the bullshit of the past three months it seems a little luck has come our way! Anyway I just wanted to share that all with some people who I think can appreciate this the most.

Not only does it ruin my opiate high and taint it, when I now smoke with no opiates, it's just pure anxiety. And now when I listen to how stoners conversate - god it's embarrassing, they think they're making sense and being profound at all times. 

Joe rogan is a good way to see how annoying weed makes people. ""Durrrr ever had a pot cookie, duude I was on Pluto mannn, so fucked upp""

Has anyone ever eaten edible weed? It's a fucking nightmare! It's like anxiety in edible form, it's like choosing to have a terrible time.

Sad really, because I used to love it man, but nothing compares to opiates, nothing.
No anxiety, no change in personality, nicer person. The addiction is a bummer sure, but that's about it.

Well, it's not the best medicine, and it hardly does anything for pain, but it sure as hell keeps you from being sick. So anyway, I was down to just 4 Tramadol left and trying to figure out what to do to make it until Tuesday, and my aunt had come down here to eat a little Christmas dinner with us, and I didn't know it at first, but she came bearing gifts!
32 Tramadol that she said she didn't need because they don't work for her! I hugged her, thanked her, and then popped 7 of those bitches to stop this horrible toothache I had. Thanks to my aunt, I was able to eat and enjoy everything yesterday, and I can make it until tomorrow without being sick at all!

We've all witnessed or experienced it - two people with similar habits meet up, and two days later they're engaged and living together, or they're 'brothers'  or 'sisters'  or whatever. Now obviously, this lifestyle requires a lot of trust and faith in  your companions. I mean, most people's friendships don't require that you be willing to commit felonies together, you know? But as fast and tight as these friendships are, they last just exactly until one or the other of the ""partners"" is more sick than  they are loyal, then as soon as the opportunity presents itself, BAM! Someone gets burned, and the partnership dies. Now, they may still talk (after all, you might need to buy or sell to each other) but the closeness is gone. 

But then you look at this place. It's always seemed odd, because by and large the people act like drug people more than Internet people. This means that rather than  regard each other as essentially nameless stimuli to react to, we treat each other like people, and then quickly like partners, or like family. And then, something amazing happens...we can't steal dope from each other (easily). So instead of inevitably falling out, we just kinda keep being excellent to each other.

I must remember that the forces of Sober Satan have tied my main to my real, meaty self. 

Jesus fucking Christ, what a night. Spent all day chasing after a pickup, which between. My. Car being broken down and it being Christmas has been next to impossible. But I'm finally able to get someone to run 30 miles out of the city to my podunk ass town to drop me off a half gram. Not only that, but they show up within a minute of the guy that brought me a dub of shards. I have good friends. So, I split the bag with Dave (you know Dave), the roommate / best friend / hetero life partner, then duck into the bathroom to prep me up a goofball. Now this skinny motherfucker has absolutely beautiful veins and doesn't fuck with stims, so I didn't think anything of hearing him announce how great it was while I was still prepping. I proceed to get caught up mixing and hitting and rushing and cleaning, that I don't even think about Dave until I open the bathroom door some time later to see him face down on the floor, twitching spasmodically. 

""Well.

Fuck. 

Fuck, fuck fuck. ""

Alright, LL. Get it together. I remind myself that I worked in medicine for years - fuck, I was an EMT, this is right up my alley. I've got this. I've gotta ugnore the fact that the boy on the ground has been a huge part of my world more than half my life. Ignore the fact that if what is happening right now comes out I'll be divorced and unemployed and homeless. That can't matter right now. But fuck, I hope I don't have to dial 911.

I know that I saved a dose of Narcan from the package u/fashionablyfake sent me a few months ago. I find a vial while rooting through my junkie box, but can't for the life of me find an IM needle. But there isn't one to be had, so I grab the longest 1/2 inch rig I have and draw up from the vial, wishing vaguely for my friend LadyDave to be here with a shot ready to draw up, for she has tiny, delicate veins and thus naturally attracts huge needless when she needs to hit. I jerk down Dave's sweat pants, feel flash of annoyance with him for being irresponsible in a way that makes me see his dick, then bury the tiny needle as far as I can I to his thigh and push off. 

Erring on the side of caution, I elect to give rescue breathing while I wait for the narcan to take effect. There is nothing quite like the decadent combination of flavors rescue breathing without a mask brings with it. Back when I was o the ambulance, you weren't allowed to call yourself an EMT until the first time someone yakked into your mouth. I had almost missed it...almost 

Finally the Narcan sinks in, boy starts to breathe on his own, and his eyes pop open, suddenly awake and alert. This is good, but we're not out of the woods yet. You see, Narcan has a much shorter duration of action than heroin does, meaning it will wear off while the heroin is still going strong. This presented a problem, as I did not have any Narcan left. This is where things diverge somewhat from the AMA's suggested protocol, because while I had no Narcan, I did have Meth. 

While he's still lucid, I fix our boy up a modest shot of shards, operating I the theory that this could be the little boost that let him power through until the flood of opiates in his brain began to recede. This seems to have worked, though I'm sure adding that additional stress to body that's already endured an OD has dangers all it's own. But my friend is still alive, and I owe that to u/fashionablyfake. Lady, you do more to protect and enrich the lives of our people than anyone realizes. I will forever be in your debt - because of you I won't have to look back every Christmas and remember losing the first member of my family that I chose, instead of being born into. I won't have to make that phone call to his father. I won't have to explain to my daughter where Uncle Dave went. Thank you so much, for everything you do but especially for giving me the tool I needed to keep one of the people who makes life worth living around. 

Stay safe, everyone.

Opiates will always hold a special place in my heart but I have a real opportunity to break free for the better and I need to take advantage of it. My friend who runs the iop was able to get me into an inpatient treatment center for what I imagine will be 2-4 weeks, followed by reinstatement to a halfway house somewhere in my location. I'm not thrilled with the idea of this step up in treatment over a single relapse, but maybe it's exactly what I need.

I sincerely hope that anyone who is considering or in an attempt to find sobriety is able to do so successfully. I was against AA/NA and having a sponsor for YEARS (i understand it is not for everyone) but finally proceeding down that path gave me those 2.5 months that I previously only dreamed of achieving. I have a long way to go but I am more focused than ever and PLEASE BELIEVE that if I can do this, every single one of you can, too.

It's raining, cloudy and grey. 
I'm waking down a sidewalk framed by restaurants and stores I can't afford. There are people all around me, but I can't hear them. Their stares pass through me like I don't exist. 

Sometimes, I feel like they're right. That I don't really exist at all. That I'm stuck wandering around in some sick mix of purgatory and a deep K hole. 

In the end, I guess it doesn't matter. Even if I am real, I don't feel quite human anymore. 

I'm mist: a cold drifting fog six feet above the concrete. As I pass through the suffocating clusters of smiles, I draw my lips together in an attempt to mimic the behavior. 
No. Too foreign. 
My mouth doesn't remember how to smile right anymore, a deflated smirk is the best my body can do. 

I step from the sidewalk to the street, and my perspective changes. I'm watching myself from a birds eye view, 30 feet in the air. I can see my messy blonde hair stark against the asphalt. 

The rain pours through the gutters like floodwater, and the street starts to collapse around me. The grey sidewalks melt into the grey buildings, and the sky stretches down to touch the curb. In an instant, the city is unrecognizable. Skyscrapers are replaced by an endless rolling horizon. Large gray clouds blot out the sunlight, leaving only a dim glow. 

The asphalt changes too. At first, the floodwater seems to mix into the cracks, leaving behind a dark slush. But with each step my feet sink deeper into the blackness, and I begin to understand where I am. 

An ocean. Deep and unending, so dark blue that the water looks like ridged obsidian. I'm completely alone, and for as far as I can see there is only water and storm clouds. 

I'm treading water as hard as I can, but the waves push me down. The waves pull at my hair and beard, they tear my clothes, and whisper lies in my ears. 

After awhile, the storm lulls a little. I'm suspended in the water, swimming up toward a light I know I can't reach. 

Blood pours out of my nose and drips onto the curb as I step off the road and back on to the sidewalk. 

God do I need some fucking oxy.

and do it myself tonight.  

Shit, now I've gone and done it;  
this abscess on my arm.

I've been pretty much clean since May of this year. I've had a couple of slips with suboxone, but nothing major. I mainly stick to the occasional weed and maybe a little bit of xanax here and there. I'll also have a couple of beers from time to time, but I'm not a big drinker at all, never have been.

Initially, the cravings were not bad at all. The first few months were actually pretty easy for me. After spending a month in treatment and another month in IOP, I was sick of hearing about drugs and I was sick of being around people. I isolated myself and I really didn't think about drugs all that much.
Recently though, the cravings have been making me absolutely miserable. I feel like I'm just a hop-skip away from a full-on relapse. A friend of mine was kind enough to share some suboxone with me a couple of times, and I got fairly high each time. But that only served to whet my appetite. I've been craving roxies/dillies ever since.

To make matters worse, I've been seeing this girl who I know can get pills pretty easily. she used to be really into it and still has hook-ups. I like her a lot, and she's super beautiful (I've actually had a huge thing for her since like high school), but I know it will eventually lead me to relapse. These past couple of days have been absolutely miserable. This time last year I was using dilaudid heavily- copping on xmas eve, xmas day, new year's... All I can think about is ""wow this time last year I was getting high"".. It's making me physically ill. I keep comparing this year to last year and thinking about how much happier I was. I know it's an illusion. I know it was unhealthy and ended up almost costing me my life. But I still want it more than anything. I can't seem to take the rose-tinted glasses off.
Top it all off, I went to go pick up some bars and weed for a friend last night and our dealer was snorting opana off a dollar bill. It literally made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

I need some advice on how to control, or at least lessen, these cravings. I'm really trying hard to get my life together, and I sure as FUCK am not going back to treatment again. I'll die before I ever go back to one of those brainwashing cults.",1482707400.0
5kajhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5kajhg/how_do_you_ever_move_on_from_using/,4,https://redd.it/5kajhg,RT122,"How Do You Ever Move On From ""Using""","So... for those who've been there, I'm just interested - how do you *ever* move on from the ""life"" centered around opiates? Sorry this ended up crazy long, but backstory: I've been ""on"" such medications since I was 10, first starting with good 'ol Tylenol 3s. Oxycontin, about 80-100mg a day in 20mgs, was begun when I was 16-17. Now, at my early thirties? I have (100% legit) prescriptions for 320/day Oxy ER, 180/day Oxy IRs + OxyFast (Liquid Oxy) 1200/week I get when times run ""low."" (aka: often) My tolerance? It's f***ing shot, believe you me - that's the main ""problem"" today, such that it is: I can easily take 600mg IR at once (1200 ER, and prolly during good times, 3000-4000mg a day total), and have it just ""right"" when it comes to ""feeling"" it. (Unfortunately, my own mom only wanted to be ""around me"" on such things... and ""liked me"" so much with my own that she started ""supplying"" me ""extra"" starting when I was 17. Eventually, due to her own legit pain issues, 2/3 of my usual (120mg dilaudid/day+360mg Oxy ERs/day, in addition to my own) ""supply"" came from there... and she passed a year ago. One can't even imagine, losing that *in addition* to the closest person you'll ever know, all at once, totally out of the blue.)

Now believe me, I do have legit pain issues. And my ""lifestyle"" because of it is part of the issue, I suppose: I leave the house maybe 6 or 8 times a year, aside from going to Drs. and getting such prescriptions filled. But my life? Singularly centered on this... and I wouldn't change a thing. It might be one of the worst things (constantly worried over the next ""happy joy joy time,"" literally counting the hours and minutes every second of every day, and lovely WDs...) but goddamn if it isn't also the absolute, unquestioned best thing that has ever been, or ever will be. It just is. It ""enables"" my brain chemistry to elevate everything, while leaving me 100% functional and fully ""myself"" - ""turning on"" certain ""happy"" chemicals that otherwise we, as living creatures, have zero control over. It gives *me* control, far more than it takes away any self-control in the neediness angle. Bottom line? If it affected everyone the same as me, every single human being living should be an ""opiate fiend"" - and the world would be a far better place for it!

I see it as simply me taking control over my neurochemistry - I want to feel ""happy""/good? Well, I have control over that - screw natural biology/evolution. 

In addition to this past year being absolute Hell, losing 2/3, where I've even lost 90lbs in a six month span (not from WDs, just hating life normally absent the ""happy joy joy"" time, where I don't even want to eat for days and days while still being on a barely ""maintaining"" portion to stave off WD.) My Dr., who I've seen for nearly 30 yrs, is like 65-66. Believe me, I obsess every day over his retiring - you simply ain't gonna get that level (or, in this opiate hating society/addiction obsessed atmosphere, *anything* short of literally dying from cancer) anywhere else, period... and I know that all too well.

And so, for a good ten years, I've accepted: If/when that ends, that's it for me. Game over at that point, no question about it. I refuse/cannot accept a life absent that ""happy joy joy"" time that my life is/became utterly centered around (like, I've even 100% lost interest in such sexuality everyone else seems so focused around. I guess I just ""grew up"" {from age 11 on} on this Hellish/miraculous substance, so it literally replaced everything else)

How do you ever accept life without it, when you've known/""tasted"" the absolutely amazing reality that it ushers in? Like I said, I'm sure my ""lifestyle"" is part of it; wake up, watch TV or game to pass the time, go to sleep. Every day, and in a truly Hellish atmosphere (The surviving parent, who I've always had a nightmarish relationship with [his own family disowned him, and he's had nobody, ever, except my mom who he treated like absolute shit] is now suffering from Alzheimer's, which he refuses to accept, let alone discuss... yeah, life is great!). Unfortunately, with my health, that ain't gonna change anytime soon. 

But I wonder, how do you move on from this without simply killing yourself if/when the good times end? Mind you, I've never once used/pursued ""illegal"" options (never used weed once in my life, hell, I don't even drink or have any f'ing coffee/caffeine. Its literally just this, and not a soul has ever been able to tell when/if I was.... ""high as a kite"", I suppose)

I'm not exactly looking forward to ending things (who would... and especially knowing such utopian realitiies as I know now exist.) All that, *hopefully*, is still at least a couple of years away; whenever my Dr. retires, but I see absolutely no point whatsoever to an existence without the delight that we all know/have known, and I cannot fathom how/why anybody can ""move on"" afterwards. So... how do you accept it or ""move on"" from pure bliss/heaven on Earth.

Mind you, due to my health issues, the public school system refused to accommodate them and provided home tutors instead - so instead of ""friends"" or the normal socialization during adolescence, my life revolved, yet again, around you know what, even well before my teens. But thusly, for me personally, what I suspect as the ""normal"" route/alternative -""get out,"" ""make friends,"" ""life is actually pretty great once you realize it!""... yeah, regrettably that doesn't look likely for me: It's amazing the situations we human beings can adapt to, including almost complete and utter isolation... but we can (at least with certain ""help"", that is!.) - yet even with those utilizing such socialization options, I still can't fathom how one can fill the ""happy joy joy"" hole and/or move on from it in acceptance... nor why one would choose to. 

Even on such insane dosages, I've never once made a choice I regretted when not at... ""kite"" levels, nor ""nodded off"" as so many seem to struggle with Oxycodone especially (although I've read that constant use during adolescence can permanently and radically alter ones brain chemistry around opiate receptors/etc. So I suppose it's possible my brain is almost uniquely suited/adapted to them now, well into my thirties.) Absent any negatives beyond the... ""craving"" aspect (and that, I admit, is... impossibly strong/potentially problematic... I mean, now its hard to have even a *single* thought 24/7/365 that doesn't somehow involve that, unless it's during a ""happy joy joy"" period where supply is temporarily not a worry. But if only from my perspective, that is just because it *is* that good, for me, not that I'm just out of my mind addicted), its especially hard to see the potential positives without it. 

But like what so many others here have lived, everyone just says ""oh, you're the nicest/most polite/greatest person I've ever met!"" Since my life pretty much revolves around the medical field, it is insane the number of nurses that have hit on me (something, as I said, I now have zero interest in, but even so this constantly happens). I was in the hospital for ten days around Valentines Day, and a married nurse about my age was constantly saying how happy she was to spend it on duty with me over her husband... and when I was discharged that time, another (again, my age-ish... and actually, really quite attractive) ****ing kissed me on the lips... in front of the entire staff (yeah, I prolly should've gotten her number...! :) ). 

My point...? Why would I *ever* want to go from being that person, back to the miserable and hateful (and probably insane/utterly cracked) SoB I'd be without my ""happy joy joy periods""? I don't want to be that person, to the point I've perfectly accepted it being sayonara time, as I know full well its who I'd be, given my horrible life, without ""it"". It's literally the only thing thats kept me sane when others would be a raving lunatic with just any one month... hell, any one week or day of my life over the past 23 years. Furthermore, these beautiful things make *everything* just ""that much"" better - how/why would you ever want to again do a ""favorite activity"" without, knowing that it could be made that much better...? I suppose I'm a hopeless case when it comes to this, because I cannot fathom any ""light on the other side""... nor have any inclination to want to. Yet I know, short of going the really ""bad route"", its something I will indeed be forced to confront. C'est la vie, I suppose.",1482705537.0

Buzzed off a good bag of D and full of content and warm cider, I finally closed my eyes and let sleep take over me (or for sharks we sometimes call this tonic immobility)

About 8 am, my eyes peel open, and I feel the anxiety in the pit of my stomach. ""What the fuck?"" I whispered. For once I wasn't depriving myself, i had just done a bag at 4 am. Sickness that isn't dopesick? This doesn't make sense to junkie shark. I stand up and dig through my bedside bowl full of paraphernalia and empty bags that I save for scrapes. Unable to locate my bun, I grab my wallet and head for the bathroom. My wallet always has a couple of emergency bags, swish. 

I'll spare you the gory details, you guys have already had one very in depth story about my bowel movements. I was shitting and puking st the same time, and it hit me, fucking food poisoning. Fuck you, ex gf, for buying off brand hot pockets. Fuck YOU, ex gf, for not heating it up all the way. As far as I know, your probably wiped your ass with it before you gave it to me. I get a text from her.

OH. Am I?? Well I don't GIVE A FUCK. It's my fucking house, he's my tenant, and he can suck a big fat black cock for 15$ and I hope at the end of the transaction he doesn't even get paid, just gets a big creamy load and a punch in the face. I understand not having sympathy for me at this point... but then again I don't. I have done everything for this girl, payed her rent, took her out of a shit job and shitty apartment and moved her all the way to the east coast. She ran up about 20 grand on my credit cards, and IM the junkie. It just makes me sad how people who have no more use for you, treat you like shit.

So anyways, I'm spending Christmas alone upstairs, crying and watching intervention. She doesn't want me downstairs because I'm sick. I don't really wanna be down there either. I hope you guys are all feeling and doing better than me.",1482682085.0

Met a nice homeless gentleman who said we can go to his hostel to score.

Was a bit apprehensive as he was needing the cash to go get the guy, don't like letting my money walk but hey ho. I waited downstairs after one of his l guys returned to the hostel. He was talking a while, about 10-15mins so I was starting to get a bit worried, i.e. He had just taken the bags and went to his room :/

I had asked him how much we was short for a bag and he said 4, I only had 3.5 so gave him that and he was very thankful. Anyways he came back down and walked me a bit back towards the city before he headed black after giving me my bags, not much smaller than my usual guy and only £10ea as opposed to £15.

I know a lot of you fine, upstanding citizens have a certain amount of experience, knowledge and skill when it comes to sending/receiving contraband in the mail, so I consider those of you who do to be qualified enough to provide me with some helpful advice.

So here it goes: Imagine, if you will, (hypothetically, of course) two junkies on opposite sides of the country from each other (that country being the glorious US of A). For example's sake, we'll call them Junkie A and Junkie B.
 Junkie A has access to a plentiful, cheap supply of quality heroin, cocaine, pharmaceuticals and pretty much any other ""hard"" drugs that can be procured within your typical open-air-market neighborhood. Junkie A is very fortunate in this sense, and sees this as an opportunity to help his recently relocated, drug-addicted kin, while also benefitting monetarily from his good fortune.

Junkie B has only a small list of unreliable D-boys that provide dope of extremely poor quality at an outrageous price. Junkie B is financially secure and extremely generous, but experiences reasonable amounts of stress upon throwing away $40 for a measly point of low-grade black tar heroin or up to $300 for a skimp gram of the same.

Junkie A's heart aches for Junkie B's unfortunate situation, and would like to do anything within his power to assist him on his quest for reasonably-priced, high-quality dope. Junkie A has been considering providing his friend with exactly that, via US Mail/FedEx/UPS.

So here's where you lovely people come into play: Neither Junkie A, nor Junkie B have hardly any experience in the field of mailing illegal drugs - or just about anything, for that matter. They are using this post as a request for any tips, tricks, techniques, and/or advice that you may have for them on the subject. A step-by-step guide would be ideal - and graciously appreciated - but a list of Do's and Don'ts, or even a few simple words of advice and/or well-wishing would be extremely helpful and generous of you to provide.

Thanks for taking the time to read about this imaginary, hypothetical situation, and any feedback you may have would be awesome. Happy nods to all my fellow junkies!

TL;DR: I am curious about hypothetically sending dope and/or other drugs domestically across the US via US Mail or other private postal services, and am requesting any and all advice, tips & tricks, Do's & Don'ts, experiences, etc. I'd like to be informed of any risks involved, precautionary measures to be taken, and anything else that someone should know before embarking on such an undertaking.",1482820604.0

Now just to stall my mum she is literally trying to push me out the door. I tell her I need 5 minutes just to get ready . So she heads up stairs to get something and I hear the beep outside ! I quickly nip out and make the transaction as quick as possibe saying I need to leave the house 5 minutes ago. I run back up the stairs and into the toilet I already have all my stuff in my pocket and cook up one of the quickest shots ever  and to put icing on the cake get myself first time !!! Shout down thats me ready and put my stuff away in my box and off to my grans to pick them up and then off to my brothers .

   We ended up there for a good few hours so thankfully I got or else I would have been miserable . When I got back home I did the other half of the half G and ordered a teenth (1.8g £50) Then later on that night my gran and grandpa came over for dinner my brother didn't come as he was having dinner with his GF family and they were just going to come over today ,which they did and was just the usual family get together nothing much exciting happened .

I started shooting in my breasts because I cannot find a good vein. Somehow this disturbs me. I nursed 2 babies with these breasts, they seem too sacred to use for shooting up. I'm alone, in the dark, sliding a flashlight over my body for a good 15, 20 minutes trying to find somewhere to inject this poison into. The smell of cooking bth is starting to make me sick. I have a bruise the size of my palm on my thigh. And yet I continue and continue and have no plan in sight to stop. 

And because of this drug, and the curiosity I had about IV use, I will be alone, albeit very fucking high, on my 40th birthday. Heroin has taken the place of everything and everyone else in my life. Is this sad? No. Pathetic maybe but not fucking sad. I did this. This was 100% my doing. How dare I sit here and feel sorry for myself. We create the lives we lead.

Needless to say I've spent all my Christmas dollars, didn't receive any cash except 40$ from my grandma that specifacly told me and my dad to make sure it doesn't go in my nose or my arm, so to look like I was a good boy I gave it to my dad. I had no ey then but now I'm regreting doing that because of course he won't give it to me because he know I don't need it for anything but to get loaded. So I have been hustling on facebook market place bought to sell an NES zapper gun for 20 bucks then I gotta return this lame helicopter I got from someone, obviously she didn't know about my drug use because the receipt was attached!! Lucky me!! So that 15$ more so I'm scraping up dollars but what I'm depressed about is that for the past couple of weeks, thanks to a fiya hustle working at toys r us( take a wild guess what I was doing)I've been going extremely hard and have raised my tolerance to the highest point its been. I just did 80$ worth of dope so like .7 in 2 shots and I'm writing this with both eyes open..  

So now my usual 40$ goal to get right is just not enough... Especially if I got to someone else other then my main guy cause he's the only one with quality and quantity.

Unfortunately what once only existed on the screen slowly krept it's way into my real life as my dad started using pills and eventually moved onto heroin. He used for many years and it was very hard on my mom and sisters..he passed away a few years ago from an overdose.

a) what I have is actually opium

b) if i'm the small % that doesn't' get affected by opiates

c) I didn't dose enough

d) my expectations were wrong 

It's approximately 1.5cm by 1cm for the larger chunk you see here (1g). Consistency feels like brittle, hard caramel. The smell is a strong, pugent plant-like smell, the kind you'd get from taking a blade of grass and breaking it down with your fingers.

I 'chased the dragon' using foil and yesterday did approx 0.1g over the course of 3h. I felt next to nothing. I passed it off as not reaching threshold.

Today I smoked 0.1g over the course of 5 minutes - that was 30 minutes ago. I feel slightly more relaxed, more carefree, but that's about it. You could feel the same from taking 1mg xanax, and add a beer to it to get the buzz.

This morning (12am Midnight) i was supposed to be at work but I called in sick even though I really shouldnt have but I didnt know what else to do.
I have been taking a substance called Tianeptine now for the better part of the last 18 months. Ive kicked it a few times in the past but I stupidly slid back over the last couple of months. I followed a good taper schedule so my withdrawal isnt too bad but the depression that comes with it is really taking its toll on me.
While I was awake at 3am my mother came downstairs (I still live at home, Im moving to a different city with my gf next weekend)to talk about how she was looking for something in my room and saw an empty bottle of vicodin that I had scored from my doctor to help with the Tianeptine withdrawal. It was for 60 pills and its only been 5 days and it was already empty. Ive struggled with pills for years and she was very upset and concerned.
I dont really know what to say in this post really just kind of rambling bc my brain and body arent communicating well right now. Im a very reclusive person, no friends except a cousin who lives half way across the country, and my girlfriend, but I have mostly kept her at arms length over my addiction bc I dont really know how to talk to people about it and anytime I speak with my parents about it they arent very helpful.
I know I need to get sober but the reality of having to face all of my problems without the glow of opiates is too terrifying. I mostly just want people to leave me alone and let me just go on with my life. I dont know how to handle it when someone is trying to help. I just feel like a sense of judgment and not an understanding of what is going on, like I know it isnt my familys fault but from the outside thats what they think.

I got it in 1 and some blood then by time I took tourniquet off it had came out vein :( couldn't get it to re register! In the end it was getting hard to go in, must have blunted the needle with all the attempts so had to just spurt it all out and use oral syringe and plug it (1st time trying this).

Had a small line worth left so snorted that, feeling alright now but not sure if the plugged h has kicked in or not? This was about an hour ago, had poooped a lot yesterday before got my H but not since then so not sure if that's why I'm not feeling it, or maybe I'm expecting it to be a lot stronger hmm

Oh well, think I'll take a break only been IVing with the last 4/5 bags so surprised it was so hard to register today :-/ even in right arm which I hardly use! Think it was just combination of the needle getting blunt (it was fresh out pack today but ofc trying to register could have dulled it a lil each time?) and maybe veins are getting a bit tougher to hit.

Oh well, if I do get a bag next week I'll go back to snorting / give plugging a proper try shame I'm not feeling as high as I could be but still high nonetheless 😩",1482928925.0

My guys boy told me he would front me a brick for me to sell and pay him back. He told me how much he wanted but it went in one ear and out the other because I already knew I wasn't going to pay him back and all 50 of those bags were going in my veins or up my nose.

I drove home and was set for half the week. Later that month I went back up to pick up (as I do everyday) and got my usual bun and 3 dimes of cook.

Back then I would do my shot as soon as I'd get it, right in my car on the streets of Newark. As I'm setting up my shot something unexpected happened, even though I should have expected it.

A brick of cement came flying through my driver's side window and into my skull. The window shattered into a million pieces as the brick fell to the floor along with my blood which was now spurting profusely from my right temple.

I looked out my window as 2 guys walked away. One, the guy who fronted me the brick, yelled ""that's what you get!""

Dazed and cold from the fridgid winters air blowing through the now destroyed window I looked down at my bottle cap which was now full of some of my blood as well as my 3 dimes and lemon juice. I did what anyone else would do after that.

I kept doing my shot. 

I came home to my friends, who were at that time living with me, and I scared the hell out of them. 

R ( my gf for 2.5 years now) was like ""what happened?!""

I told her everything as wiped the blood away from my eyes and face and started to clean myself up, still ripped from my cook. I ended my story with...

""I can't even be mad. I had it coming. And the irony is hilarious. I got hit with a brick for stealing a brick!""

In retrospect I should have parked somewhere else or waited until I got home. I should have atleast kept my eyes out for the dealer I beat but hindsight is 20/20 and it doesn't achieve a thing.

We had so much fun together, from stopping in every town to steal beer from walgreens to talking politics at a rest stop drunk off our asses. Fuck the bourgeoise pigs, Charlie, fuck them right in their ass! 

He loved heroin, jack Daniels and having a good time and died doing what he loved. He wouldn't have wanted it any other way, except he wanted to at least wait a few years before going out. He was going to come back to California and get a house with me after he got off parole and got a good job. We were going to travel and try heroin from all over the world and seize all of the means of production. He didn't care that I was 19 and he was 28 because like he said.... ""Pretty, communist, junkie girls don't grow on trees and the age difference won't be as weird once I'm off parole anyways!"" He talked about me all the time and his family apologized that I found out through Facebook posts but they couldn't figure out who I was on facebook so they could message me and let me know. The last time I saw him in person involved my at the time boyfriend beating the fuck out of him because he came downstairs and saw us drunk passed out naked in each others arms. It's kinda funny in a way. I'm glad I got to be intimate with him before he left.

So I am coming to the point where I need/have to get clean. I have tried the taper thing and honestly have run out of time so now I need a fast way to get clean and do it. I have roughly a G a day BTH smoking habit and can eaisley drink a 5th a day of vodka or just 4 beers. (My drinking is not my top priority right now)

Medical Detox- So I call a center that would do this and inquire about what medication they give and what my overall comfort level will be. Especially if one of them is trying to charge $9,600 for a 6-7 day detox. What they explained is that I will basically go cold turkey and they will get me clean by using benzo, klonidine and Seroquel along with muscle relaxers and who else knows in a hospital setting.

Home Detox with Bupe - I can go this rout, my running buddy did this and she was able to wait the 24-36hrs of WD to safely take the bupe and not get PWD. She seemed to be doing great after 3-4 days with the help of xanax and drinking. (Also could I use Lope Or Kratom during the wait to take bube or would that cause PWD?)

For some reason I expected to find a Detox place that would help me through those 36hrs of WD to avoid PWD and then help me level out on bupe but the places so far want to do a Detox....its called detox for a reason i guess. 

What do you guys think I should do? I'm calling a few more Detox places today that are supposed to be considerably cheaper then the first one I called so $$ may not be that big of an issue. Also if I was to do the Home WD I don't really have a home with running water so no showers or great toilets to deal with my stomach issues.  

Any input would be great! Thanks!

Edit to my idiotic spelling of Bupe!!! And the title will perm shame me. Please look past my bad spelling. ",1482870315.0

I have never posted to Reddit before, but I had a question and hoped someone here would be able to help! I have been lurking for a few years, so I thought it was about time to introduce myself. 

I have been using Opiates for three years. Started innocently enough, I was diagnosed with stage three endometriosis and given Vicodin 10mg/325mg 4 times a day. Well i ended up using my whole script in two weeks and then buying Oxy off the street. This pattern continued for years, until my doctor cut me off. 

I found out I was pregnant in July, I am now 7 months pregnant with a baby girl. My husband and I couldn't be more thrilled. I started at a Methadone clinic as soon as I found out I was pregnant. I have been completely clean since I started treatment six months ago, and currently take 65mg per day.

I do not know anyone personally who has had a baby while on MMT. Has anyone here ever expirenced this? Do you have any advice? How long was your baby in the NICU? With the stigma of Methadone while being pregnant- my SO and I have not told our family yet. I'm worried about telling them, were the people in your life understanding about your Methadone use? 

I'm sorry if this post is uninteresting or too long. Thank you for allowing me to be here with you all :)

Have a great day :) ",1482864803.0

Let's pretend you're an hour away from the nearest hospital and have no narcan. I'm thinking of PST or other methods of ingestion that come on slowly. Let's say you're starting to nod, and you think ""shit, this is too much"".  Are there any tried and true ways of keeping yourself up and breathing while waiting for help to arrive?

I have almost no stimulants on hand these days, but I've got an entire bag of anhydrous caffeine powder. Would it be helpful to take 500mg-1g of that to increase respiration rate? I've taken that high of a dose before and been fine (well, ok...) so we'll ignore the fact that 1g is a shitton of caffeine.

Also, what about physical stimulation? Hot shower? Cold shower? No shower cause you may fall down and hurt yourself? 

Inflict physical pain on yourself to stay awake? What about eating food? Good idea or bad idea?

Sorry if this sounds naive; I'm just interested in what options I (or a friend) would have in such a scenario.

My actual and potential involvement with the law is below; out of these, what do you think is the most likely reason he would have paid me a visit? 

I know it's all just speculation but I'm curious what other thoughts are based on past experience/knowledge... I hate the unknown.

1. I had a warrant out due to unpaid parking tickets, but it was taken care of last week. A search into my dockets shows those as closed and there are no other active cases against me/warrants etc.

2. My SO has a warrant out for some bullshit at a state park over the summer that I was present for but nothing was filed against me. The cops came a couple of months ago to arrest him but he wasn't there and the state park ranger just left a note. Only my name is on the lease so it isn't on papers as living with me. I looked into his dockets and it looks like there was a ""fugitive declaration"" filed earlier this month. 

3. I'm pretty sure one of my connects was busted and I've purchased from her a couple of times since when I believe she was- only very small amounts and it appeared she was extra cautious so I don't think it could have been seen by even an undercover or anything.

4. My car was stolen over the summer and I was paid a visit by a cop and a fire marshal at that time. They were huge assholes to me but I didn't hear from them again and everything was wrapped up with my insurance company. 

5. I was in a pretty bad accident about a year ago and the other party tried to sue me but they were found to be at fault so nothing ever happened with that.

I'm thinking #2 but my SO thinks there would have been more cops and a search warrant or something since they had already been to my house to arrest him once before. Also, it was a local cop and the state park was in another county close enough that he would think they would just come down themselves. None of the other possibilities make much sense to me though.

About a month and a half ago, I injured my foot, I went to Walgreens with a Tylenol/Codeine script, got denied by the pharmacist because it hadn't been 30 days since I got my Suboxone script. Even  though I told the pharmacist I wasn't taking it anymore (I wasn't). So now I have a horrendous cough/sore throat and want to get it taken care of, but I don't want to put myself in a situation where A. I get denied a script and I'm miserable in pain, and B. Embarrass myself... so I'm wondering..

Should I go to one of those CVS Minute Clinics or a urgent care? I don't want them to pull up all my records and be like ""Yeah this guy has to take tylenol"" I feel if I'm paying money to see a Doc, I want relief + it to be taken care of.. Going to a doc just for over the counter medicine is just a ripoff if I'm ALREADY taking it, and it's not helping..

This isn't about abusing the system or wanting a buzz, I genuinely want to feel better..

I've done a lot of research online and have not come up with much information on this.  I'm reaching out to this community as I think you may have some insight on this that may help us.

My spouse and I are in the adoption process and have been selected by a pregnant birth mother to adopt her child.  We just received a copy of her medical records and see that she has tested positive for opiates in a recent urinalysis.  We've been asked to make a decision very quickly if we are willing to proceed.

Her opiate levels are just over 2,500+ ng/ml.  Her creatinine level is low at under 10 mg/dl.  Her test paperwork suggest ""values of less than 20 show possible dilute specimen:"".

We have limited information other than that but her explanation is that she has chronic kidney stones, and she took one hydrocodone 5 325 that month.  The test was around the 15th so that is a 2 week window.  We also saw on her paperwork being prescribed the hydrocodone 4 months ago.

Our highest concern is for the baby's health.  If what she is saying is true we don't think one dose would terribly concerning.  What worries us is the possibility of a diluted specimen.  We'll have to make our own call on how honest she is being.  But what we cannot find much information on is what these levels of opiates mean in terms of use, and if that coincides with her explanation (or if it's possible something else is going on).  If 2,500 ng/ml is diluted, what does that mean her levels were at undiluted (about 160 pounds)?  How much hydrocodone or opiates did she really take with a diluted level like that?

I know this isn't the type of post normally seen here and but I absolutely value the wealth of collective knowledge you have.  Thanks for any info or insight you can provide!",1483018295.0

Gonna be an 18 month break, oh joy! Got caught up a little while back with a ""PCS- heroin"" charge. Therefore; I'll be starting both probation and drug court on the 14th, which is going to be an ordeal, I already know it... 



So I'm kinda just having some fun before I decide to detox myself, also kinda putting it off till I can find more suboxone to do my quick taper- which is turning out quite fucking difficult to find. As of right now, I have a half of an 8mg sub pill; 4mgs. Worst case scenario, I take 2mgs day one, then 1mg for the next two days. Not even remotely great, not even 'kinda mmkay', more like ""well that's gonna fucking suck!"" Now ideally I would like to get 1 more sub, and try my best to take 2mgs per day for 5 days, with day one allowing myself a little more, and any remaining to take as I see fit. 

Should probably state that my habit right now is pretty good sized. I IV anywhere from .5 of this HELLA FIRE (lit. see- hell-fire, from my homie, the devil, himself) up to 1.5 if it's just your average everyday normal dope (also, I'm in the wonderful Pacific North Wesf, so it's all black tar). So, the first part of this post is to ask your experiences, advice, and what-have-you with quick sub tapers like mine...



The second part of this post is to ask your experiences, advice, success and horror stories about the infamous drug court. Of EVERYONE in my little junkie infested town that I have asked, not one person can even name someone who has competed this thing, which is certainly daunting. However, I am determined. I've been a heroin addict for the last 10+ years (started at 16, about to turn 27), and I'm about to basically just stop the week before I start everything, and just power the fuck through the next 18 months. Some would say to stop now, just to be safe. Some would say that the first UA doesn't matter so use up until. But nah, I'm compromising and using now, while making sure I do pass that first UA, cause failure of drug court means my felony sticks- and fuck that! So for the next 18 months it looks like I will be reacquainting myself with some LSD, mushrooms, and other non-detectable substances. And that's okay, I'm a hippie through and through, and my junkie self has gotten in the way of that. 

So any advice or whatever on either topic here would be greatly appreciated! Thanks y'all. ",1483006526.0

I have never once seen this sub be so cruel. Such hurtful things were said that if I had been in any lower of a place mentally,  or was someone else,  I might have done the world a favor and ended all my problems, permanently. Instead I bottled up all the hurt and self loathing that had doubled in a matter of a single post, and pushed it far below my surface,  but even thinking about how incredibly hateful almost everyone was towards me is choking me up as I fight back tears. 


You guys have been such an amazing,  close knit and caring sub since the moment I started subscribing to.r/opiates,  roughly five years, and in all this time I have never seen you guys gang up and just psychologically rip a person apart like what happened last night, and what's even more messed up is that no one had a clue as to what was REALLY happening,  and if anyone read my post prior to the dope porn one, 99% if the community still probably didn't read it that well before heading my way with pitchforks and hatred pouring from their heads and into fingertips, then throwing every insult humanly possible into the face of a currently extremely depressed and lonely soul. If you have read my posts since my creation of this account,  you know my life is far from a cakewalk.










 I spent three years with the love of my life while he abused me physically and mentally and was always busy attempting to prove my love to (without success)  and our third attempt at making things work, the very same love of my life decided to wreck my life yet again by robbing my family, whom I begged into allowing us to stay with them while getting back onto our feet. We had just been evicted from the cute little house I rented a room in and moved him across the country to be with me. I even lined him up an amazing job with family,  who waited in vain for him to show up and start his his trainine. I would take the bus two hours each way to go to my job as a dancer and stay on a full 8 hour shift. By the time work was closes, I would have to wait two more hours until the bus was running again and head back on another two hour ride. I would be panicking and pleading and begging as my ex would blow up my phone the second the club closed threatening to leave me to come back to him and all his stuff gone if I didn't get my worthless ass home so I could trade him my dope in exchange for being ignored or mentally abused every day. Id wake up at 3 pm, make him and I lunch and dinner,  then rush through showering and cleaning up since he never did, dreading his call about me gavibg so much a lot of time to get home quotes dope. We ended up getting kicked out because after I made up excuses for about a week in a row for him as to why he wasn't showing up to the interview my family's company they finally decided he didn't want that job that bad after all. After we moved in with my family he just lay around complaining all day. I ended up getting him a very part-time job by begging strangers on Craigslist to take pity and allow him to work for them,  and thankfully I got in contact with this guy, and he and my got along just great,. But my ex always wanted to pick fifhtsght with me all the time for some time until one day he asked me to go get rolling papers down the road for cigarettes. By the time my aunt and uncle's house taking about $5,000 worth of stuff including in my opinion the worst part, my cousin laptop. My cousin is extremely autistic and painfully shy like most autistic people are but the minute she met my X he took a liking to him and offered him the use of his laptop anytime you want it. I had never seen him on to anybody so fast and then the piece of s*** went and stole it. Anyway my uncle who happened to be retired Marine and all 3 of my cousins child in the car to hunt him down. I saw him first walking down the street and I sort of tuck and roll out of the car and ran to him putting myself between him and my family begging him not to hurt him because I love him. The very next day  I caught him going through my things trying to steal anything valuable and when I went to reach for my cigarettes she was holding he jumped on me and nearly choked me to death. The neighbors heard the commotion and called the cops my boyfriend threw my phone out into the field behind the apartment scratched himself in the face and told the cops that I attacked him even though she was wanted in the city my aunt lives lived in because he tried going to the pawn shop to sell this s*** he stole from them. And of course as always I go to jail. I was in for a month-and-a-half which wasn't bad except I lost my job and when I was released I have been fired from my job for not showing up I have no money or phone and couldn't go back to my aunt and uncle's after standing up for my ex after he stole from them. They assumed I was in on it so I was not welcome back. And so I was on the streets with nothing but the clothes on my back desperation. It was cold outside I was hungry and heartbroken and all alone remember hearing about the truck where I can go sell my body quick cash. I decided instead of being cold and sad and hungry and sleeping and dumpsters I would sell my ass instead and never let another person into my heart the way I did so foolishly with him. If I didn't get close to anybody I couldn't get hurt. Until I caved and moved out yet again even after about sending me to jail for the second time when he should have gone and even telling me how much money I'm cheating on you I was in jail he was also very happy with his new place that he helped pay rent by using  some of the money he had Got from stealing from my fam and pawning it,  and made sure to tell me all about the girl he has been cheating on me with her she was Bambini in every way. Now let me say it has always been between the two of us. When we met you were sober and have good jobs respect yourself. We slept in the same bed for an entire month and never touched each other. He was so polite and chivalrous and sweet adorably Southern just my knight in shining armor in real life. For half tgw relationship we never even had an argument and the first time in jail was also the first time a man pever hit me. I still do and always will love him because I know the real him the sober him with dreams and goals, he swept me off my feet,and took my breath away. And then things changed it almost felt like overnight it happened so quickly. We got into vicious fights beating each other down and destroying whatever rooms wed fight in, tearing shit up around the house. He would  be angry at me for something trivial and then he'd start talking s*** saying the most mean ugly and hurtful things you can say to somebody, especially someone you say you love. I would try leaving to cool off and every time i I try to escape the situation and he'd follow me outside yelling about what an utterly unloved and unwanted personl I was and how I was going to be found dead with a needle in my arm and no one would care enough to even come to my funeral. Then he started talking about relationship counseling and how much he loves me and was willing to do anything to fix our lllrelationship. But uh oh, this time I really WAS a shore. But I made more than enough to indulge in a healthy habit of heroin and meth for us too keep us off the streets and then a nice warm safe Hotel I bought him a new phone , wardrobe, random gifts all the time, smokes for the both of us, and knew that lanything he wanted, hed just bat those pretty hazel eyes at  me and I would buy it for him. ...


Granted those pics from last night weren't great and I'm not the most photogenic of people. But het I looked good and I know for damn sure
 nice body for someone who's 26, an avid outdoorswoma who takes pride in her scars,  who has 0 kids, hasbeen on hard drugs 10 years almost without stopping, the weight fluctuation from going to jail, oming out fluffy, then going back in smoked ouuu and I know it's true. Had I not mentioned the fact that I came into contact with an HIV positive person and instead just posted the picllI'm 100% sure that just like every other time people would be tripping over their dicks to compliment me. Instead I got told how disgusting I am so ulgly how I am nothing but trash and worthless and some people even telling me to do the world a favor and off myself so I don't get anyone else sick, amongst more just concentrated hatred and open judgment for ""selling my disgusting diseased cunt"" , the folks attacking me for prostituting and knowing im positive,  standard ""wouldn't touch it with my dogs Dick "" where last month my dope born needed fuckboy repellent. All these comments were based on incorrect inferences pieced together from a couple recent updates,  and it turned into a feeding frenzy with me getting torn to bits right in the middle. Let me tell you the deal with me a you have even the tiniest bit of fact about what it is that going on, 100% unfiltered straight from the horses mouth,.










Number one. As far as me working goes I have not worked  ever since I came into contact with mr. HIV positive and not going to tell you guy. We shot speed that night and against my better judgement phe and I messed around without a condom after going through about 3. However and thank God or Jesus or whoever he could not keep it hard and never managed to stay fully erect,  and he did not ejaculate which is whalt holds the virus  HIV. He kept offering to share these old beat looking rigs he had and I just was like uh no thanks, you keep those spoons buddy I need my brand new ones and no I don't want to use any of your gear. I really have never been the lucky type but I'm actually grateful for dope Dick dilemma
That night. 








The assumption I was out working. Without wrapping it up nonetheless.... And how you guys thought... I dunno, you were watching me give some random, John aids for Christmas had me just in disbelief that I've always been totally candid about my life as a prostitute talking about whatever is on my mind.., so the accusation of me working and not being adamant about protecting myself and others,  now even more so got me upset n irritated because 99% of cases I use a condom. Really the only guys I don't like I said I am interested
In as a serious  boyfriend. I have to be REALLY  serious about wanting to get to know this guy better and of course we use protection until I know for a fact I'm going to be monogamous couple. I even make guys wear a rubber for
 dome. My fuckhead ex is where I got the hepatitis from sharing shooting equipment.  ANDLLL
Any time im shooting up with others I make sure they know not to use my equipment.  As im currently livibf
With my immediate family within five minutes of entering the house I made sure they all new not to use my Razor my tweezers my toothbrush or anything of that nature because I didn't want them getting sick. It makes me rage so hard to know that dirtbags like the guy who could have gotten me sick are just roaming around looking to spread the disease knowingly. I do everylthing I can to educate my friends and I have no shame when it comes to letting people know not to use my stuff because I have hepatitis. I'm not embarrassed when it comes to tellingpeople at all. In fact let's keep it super 100. I used do you have a boyfriend who was a total sleazebag and would sleep with anything with a heartbeat. 1 years you went off to Hawaii for vacation and when he came back he brought me a gift... The clap. I didn't even have any symptoms and bad habit hide it for around four months while we were taking a break. I had no idea I had it and she looked regular healthy down there you know. After our little 3-month break I went to rehab  just to get checked up and lo and behold I had it. It was cured with one pill but I was so embarrassed and pissed I could have killed him. And now I had to talk to people like 3 and tell them they need to go to the doctor. It was hella embarrassing. And unfortunately being born with a conscience I couldn't just sit there and let them spread it and not tell them. I always feel like we extra guilty for everything everything's my fault anyway so it has made me a pretty honest person and growing I know the difference between wrong and right. Even the idea of me being hiv-positive and sexually active and not telling my partners makes me feel like I'm burning in hell. There's no way I can do to somebody what that piece of s*** did to me by not telling me. Apparently it's not the easiest things to cat ch and I wasn't even fully exposed to it. I was very depressed OCD episodes I can't stop thinking about one thing or another and yesterday happened to be obsessing over the HlIV scare I had. There is a Slim to basically no chance that I was exposed to enough of the virus to actually catch the diseas. I'm very clean, and I expect the same courtesy when I escort. I don't want a whiff of sweaty taint when I go Down on someone and I always assume they didn't order a bethonged tuna melt , ya dig?








Me and my party n play fuck buddy who took most of those pics is a friend of mine that I've had a while, and we have an ongoing mutually beneficial latex wrapped meth sprinkled sexy time.  Ill be getting the HIV mouth swab in a week then again after a month.








 

And inb4 ""but you said you were symptomatic! !!1!"": a kind soul dropped me a message and told me im likely feeling my HepC acting up and kicking a tad from my two week bender, and. now that I think about it, it is the same symptoms from my HepC ive had the past couple years. I freaked out because when I was in jail, eating well, with a normal sleep schedule and off the dope,  I actually felt great. My liver never bothered me once in lockup 














Sorry if you're endowed with an attention span to rival a fruit fly, but I had to tell y'all wtf is really going on with that whole fiasco, and let you and you and your grandma know that my pretty pussy is(still at the moment) clean and on paper saying so. And I also wanted to let you know that even if it wasn't me that was being picked on, I would've still called all out because that shit y'all were on was mean as fuck and everyone was ignorant about what was really going on. Thank god I had great. (Wrapped) tacked out sex nd then shot h all night or I would still probably be weeping.  That ganging up bullshit is a bitch move,  assuming is STILL making an ass out of you and its almost 2017. 4Chan called,  they want their asshole neckbeard hecklers back. Nah jk but you know how shifty you feel after a visit to r/drugs? After getting dogpiled by jerkoffs who notice a disgusting junkie on their turf?  I felt like a fuckin two headed leprosy mutant or something the way you guys talked to me, and that is fucked up, we do not appreciate being attacked like one hi school burn book, and if you still have some mean ass comment then shove it up your gaping asshole. Because today, I got no time for your negativity,  and im happy and secure enough with myself to be able to be the good. Kind, caring individual this shitty world needs more of.  Y'all should be ashamed of yalls behaviour yesterday.  Absolutely appalling, guys.

Long time no see r/opiates. I've missed you. I've recently spent some time to get my life in order due to my ADHD and have been staying away from hard drugs for some time. But now I'm getting back to my casual relation to harder drugs.

During my 'off season' I found out that people can actually see things in their mind, that it's not just an expression to ""picure"" or ""visualize"". So I've begun developing my minds ability to create mental imagery. For those of you that may not know:

**Aphantasia**: The inability to picture things in ones mind.

I've come a far way. Many people divide the type of visualizations into three steps.

The first and most basic is the one you can do with open eyes, it's not really there, but it's there and clear.

The second is where you actually can 'see' things in your mind.

And the final is more close to the dream state. Most normal people have to meditate to reach this state of visualization. Also what people often refer to as day dreaming.

I've been able to master step one, which has helped me a lot with communicating with other people. It turns out, most of what people say is based on their mental images. This makes relating to what people say easier and I can do it while people talk, instead of before, when it took me a while to 'get it'.

Much of this development has been accelerated with the use of psychadelics and dissociatives. They have more helped me find the triggers for mental imagery, rather than given me the ability. Maybe this could be done with opiods, but I'm not looking for a quick fix, this takes time. Otherwise it's a risky game to play, getting this far has taken 6 months.

I've been struggling a bit with the second step, but have found some exercises that helps improve this, but it takes time. If people are interested, make a comment and I'll explain as well as I can and link some source of information.

**Interesting background**

Last time I did H, I found I could easily enter a pseudo dream state when closing my eyes. While developing my mental imagery I remembered this and it got me thinking about the relation between this and opiods.

**Question/thdr**

Do you have any experiences with mental imagery or lucid dreaming on opiods? Does it increase this activity, or if you have aphantasia, does it give you any mental images?

Any experiences related to this is appreciated!!

Comfortably Numb--Pink Floyd

Snowblind--Styx

Hotel California--The Eagles 

House of the Rising Sun--The Animals 

Baby Blue--Badfinger

Otherside--Red Hot Chili Peppers 

Heroin--Velvet Underground (ofc)

I'm a fairly new drug user, and I'm a stimulate only user. One of my friends I haven't been in contact with for awhile hit me up asking if I had a connect for H. 
She usually gets her stuff from her home town which is 5 hrs away from where she lives now. 
I do have a connect for H ...but I also have a neighbor who works at a clinic and has methadone patches stocked up. 
I could get her a couple patches for free and give them to her or I could hook her up with the connect. 
Im at a crossroad because I know she's nodding right now and she just wants to stock up cause she has the money. Chances are if I offer her the methadone she'll just end up making the 5 hr drive while nodding to get the H from her hometown. 
I don't know if enabling her with a convenient connect is a good idea. She's reckless and going thru a breakup, lives alone, and has no family out here. She gave me a spare and I've walked in 3 times now to her passed out in the shower with the spoon and needle empty on the toilet seat. I know I'd be pissed asf if someone denied me a connect while I was feening. What do I do?? ",1482962367.0

I snort a few blues and its like none of that matters anymore. I'm just content to be all alone. Just wondering how many users are like me?

5ksmui,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5ksmui/vicodin_and_tramadol/,2,https://redd.it/5ksmui,opithr,Vicodin and tramadol,So recently I've been taking a break from opiates. Last time I used was Friday with 2 tramadol and 5 Vicodin spread out. I had been using everything from opium to codeine this semester. I went thru minor withdrawal about 4 times. Day 5 for me now. I did take 3 trams just now but no real opes. However I plan on using Vicodin and tram Sunday with a dose of 6-8 vics spread out and 2 trams maybe 3. My dad is prescribed them and literally gets a fuckload of tram and I usually buy vics and he gets quite a few of those so I will grab a couple. He always had extra so everyone is good and I do have legit shoulder pain with surgery already on my left and about to have surgery on the right one. I also lift a lot and am active daily. So I do have pain but I notice if I do vics and trams at the same time the high is significantly better than either or alone. Both seem to last longer and when I reside I actually feel it just as much the second dose. Anyone else like combining trams with their opiate of choice? Also if I stick to once or twice a week on vics and trams I'm good to go addiction wise. My problem was opium. Ever looking to cut back on H I highly suggest it. It's really cheap too.

I've been writing post lately trying to get ideas on the best way to kick my 4 year 1G a day BTH habit. 

After calling multiple rehab/detox centers and realizing some are no better then locking your self in a hotel room. Also costing up to 10grand for a 5-7 detox I would really like to avoid.

So I have come up with kicking by my self using suboxone, but to get past 30ish hrs so I don't run into PWD is what always gets me. So to get past the 30ish hrs I plan to take lope and good quality Kratom (anyone experienced with using Kratom when WD and then going to subs and possibly taking them together after I level out) Benzos will be used heavily/safly too and may try to get an emergency appointment with a psychiatrist to get some other meds. 

Basically I would hate to be taking Kratom and make it to the 30ish hr mark to take my first does of Sub and end up still going into PWD. 

I plan to do a fast 2 week sub taper, I've had success with that in the past coming off opanna and am a strong believer the less is more with bupe. 

What do you guys think? Especially on what to do to make that 30ish wait tolerable. I honestly find that the hardest to deal with. Also from the Kratom subreddit I hear ppl have used just Kratom to kick but from my true opiophies I would like to know how kratom has effected a heavy opioid user.

You guys have always been great with answering questions even the ones that have been asked a 100 times,  I appreciate all the help in advance because I will be doing this kick alone.  

I plan on placing my order today so strain suggestion our welcome as well.

5kryxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5kryxl/amber_deserved_better/,18,https://redd.it/5kryxl,theexchangedoc,Amber deserved better,"I had a really good holiday. The best in years. Another year living with my brother and enjoying having him in my life. Hard to believe that two years ago I flew home to California for a holiday that just isn’t there. I sat across from my brother talking through the glass. He’d sit there in his jailhouse jumpsuit looking ashamed and ashen. He could barely look at me when I’d say Merry Christmas and that I loved him. The guard would come in saying our time was up. I’d hold back tears in the parking lot, smoking a cigarette knowing he’ll be out of that cell soon and he’ll get his tan back. I’m so grateful that it seems these times are behind me. I wish Amber would have had the same luck. 

When I was ten years old, mother dearest lost her job and couldn’t afford to pay the rent. It had been years since my father was in touch with us and food stamps just weren’t cutting it so me, mother dearest and my three siblings moved in my grandparents. It was chaos since my cousin, aunt and uncle with their respective pets lived there as well. At one point there were 10 people in that three bedroom house and I would have done vile things for a second bathroom! Now, I had protection from mother dearest and her constant physical and verbal abuse. Though we were stacked on top of each other, I could avoid her somehow and my grandmother would step in to help me. My siblings were too small to break anything up before. Now I had back up...and witnesses. 

When I was 12 years old my mother started dating a man that I despised. He lived in a town a few hours away in the middle of bum fuck nowhere. The first time I went there my gut said to run. But where? It was dirty and there was no food. Mother dearest would disappear with man and we’d be challenged to spend the day outside. The man had two children. One was a boy that my brother became fast friends with. His daughter was Amber. I remember smoking cigarettes with her while she attempted to play guitar and convince me she was a slut. I kept my opinions to myself since she was a lot taller then me but let’s just say she wasn’t impressing me by saying how many people she had blown. Needless to say, I hated it there. One time my mother didn’t make me go and it was a welcome break from her bullshit. She came back early that afternoon. I remember she was early because I didn’t expect her back until that night. My stomach hurt when I saw the car. She got out of her Honda and says “Layla, we’re going to move to Colusa.” I’ve never felt more afraid in my life. My sisters got out of the car. They looked dirty and hot but didn’t say anything to me. Amber was with them. 

Hours pass. I’ve locked myself in the bathroom with a knife. Tears and blood have been shed. My mother is in the back of a cop car kicking at the door and windows like a caged animal. My grandparents say nothing as their daughter is officially removed from the residence. For years the result of domestic disputes with the cops was that I was a bored little brat that needed more attention and medication. This time the verdict was truly realized: my mother was a cancer that needed to be removed. Finally I raised Hell and was left with the best ashes. As my grandfather left to retrieve my brother, I remember my grandmother asking Amber if she would call her dad to let them know he was coming. This was the first time I ever heard Amber sound like a kid. She pleaded and begged to live with us saying her father was like my mom. My grandmother stared at her, speechless. She had just lost her daughter and officially took in four grandchildren in only a few hours. Another kid she barely knows asked for the same solace. (Grandma was the sweetest most bad ass woman and the day she died this planet got a lot shittier by the way). That was one of the only times I ever saw her truly conflicted. She calmly asked Amber to call her father. I never saw her again. I turned 13 the next day. 

My brother recently mentioned that Amber had died. Hard to say if it was a drug overdose or a suicide from what I gather. I wonder what would have happened if Amber stayed with us? I don’t know. I think about her on Christmas now.

So I have been researching for about 2 weeks the safest way to bring 3-5g of Ecp onto a plane and past tsa security from one big city to another. The common answer is buy multivitamin capsules empty them and refill with the H but I have not read any posts about the density differences between the pills and the H. I have chosen valerian root pills in a dark brown plastic container. The color of the valerian root is a light brown and the H is a chalky tan. They also look a little different as far as texture when compared next to each other. Would I be better off traveling with only the 3-4 pills filled with the dope or mixing the valerian root pills on top so as to dress them up. I know I don't post a lot but I would greatly appreciate any advice and help I receive. Also I will be boarding in about 5 hours. I am a last minute person.

We're heading there today and haven't been there in some time, can I still purchase Kratom legally in NC?

Edit: Question 2.) I've found Kratom's exorbitant cost exceeds its value. It'sess effective as both a maintenance substitute (keeping me comfortable in between doses) or to ease withdrawals when compared to cheaper and more accessible alternatives such as getting sub strips or tech pills from a friend. Anyone else use Kratom and either prefer it to sub as an opiate alternative or to ease withdrawal effectively and if so how'd you do it?

I plan on going to the ER in about 4 hours once my girl gets home with the car, because I am sure some antibiotics will take away the infection and the pain as well.  However I am going insane from chewing on ice and having to put more in before the last piece dissolves..I am on the brink of having a panic attack.

My best guess here its its just a fentanyl analogue. Especially since its not overly strong. Generally I'll get decent rush. For about an hour or two I'll feel pretty nice. Very short legs, usually I'm always fiending to want to do another shot very quickly. But if I start with a big enough I can hold off for about 4 hours generally.

My car was packed with tweaking literary geniuses apparently because the 4 of them were louder than a show at Red Rocks Amphitheater. The 4 of them would not let each other talk. It was 4 voices yelling at the same time in utter chaos. 

We hit the plugs house and grab our shit and head back to the crib when the dealer from earlier shows up outside our boys house. ""WHY THE F*CK DIDN'T HIT ME UP FOR DOPE YOU PIECES OF SHIT? YOU KNOW I NEED MONEY"" yelled this fucking guy. Our old Dboy was the most entitled douchebag ever. He would cut people off for not buying from him in a week. So we tell this guy that we're done with his way of doing business. So my new plug and I let him know he isn't needed anymore and we'd beat the shit out of him if he didn't leave. It took no more than 5 seconds for that skinny fuck to hop in his car and leave. To celebrate we went inside and got high as a kite. 

Overall it was a pretty tame day of flipping sacks and dealing with douche canoes, but I found a new homie who is really tight.

I experience an increased ability in cognitive abilities as it relates to insightfulness and writing to express that. I am also no writer or English major and usually find minimal enjoyment in taking time to compose my ideas.

In addition (and as a twofold): I feel an almost meditative, relaxed feeling one oneness such that my creative capacity is increased. I find pleasure in doodling (with better ability when compared to usual), in thinking about my life in abstract ways to better solve my personal problems and really love using a thesaurus (no I didn't this time because I am getting food!).

The second prong of my promised twofold is that, this seems to occur maximally when I have been using regularly or semi-regularly. If I haven't used, I am too noddy and relaxed.

Lastly, I have no time to proofread this (not that it matters), I am not new to opiates (like over a decade not new lol) AND I would love if you guys would throw out ideas as to why this enhancement of the above mentioned criteria happens, if you also notice this and if you believe it is an *actual* increase in ability or just perceived.

I've had an increased intellectual curiosity while using opiates since high school, so this is nothing new!

Anyway I've been using Fentanyl intranasally for about a year, however owing to it's ridiculously short half life and the constant redosing it's difficult to stay in control of, and even if I take a break I quickly build up a huge tolerance again and am therefore seeking advice on a gentler, longer lasting opiod.

I've been off fent for a couple of weeks, got onto the subs and am now down to 1mg a day, I figure if I continue to taper the subs, take a break for a week or two my tolerance should be greatly reduced.

The next 3 months are massively important in my life, and I can do without spending them in the depths of anxiety and depression.
I am therefore seeking an alternative to fent, i'm not too keen on using H as I want to monitor my dosage and you never know the purity of the H you are buying, I need something affordable (my main reason for useing Fent has been the low cost).
My options at the moment are:

20mg Oxycontin - $15 a pill
30mg Codeine phosphate - $5 a pill
20mg Morphine - $15 a pill

With the exception of Codeine I've never used any of these medications before. Obviously the Oxys seem like the best value - but is there any reason I should use the other meds instead?

I'm not really looking to get high, just to work through my affairs with the energy, confidence and lack of depression that opiates give me, I'd like something long lasting so as not to be constantly popping pills (and to keep costs down).

Are the pills I've mentioned too weak to get any kind of decent effect from?

Also, considering I can get fent for about $3 per mg is it possible to dose orally and use an MAOI or some type of extended release capsule, so that I could get by on only dosing twice a day? Is it possible to create some kind of homemade extended release skin patch?

I've been considering a maintenance program lately and I've been wondering which to do. I plan on going to a clinic that does suboxone, subutext, and methadone. I've used both suboxone and subutext and know I'd prefer subutext because of how awful the films taste, but I've never ever tried methadone. I've been considering it because it seems so nice to just chug some shit and get to feeling better, no precipitated withdrawal, still being able to use if I fucked up without extreme physical consequences - but sub seems ideal for the opposite reason. Suboxone seems to offer more privledges more quickly, meaning I can travel, and it seems easier to taper with because you're fully in charge of your dose. Anyway, that IS my biggest question: which is easier to taper from? Physically speaking? Is one easier than the other to drop off from? I have seen what a long term suboxone use looks like, and holy shit, but I have also heard horrible things about methadone detox. However, I've also heard great things about it, and how if you're tapered correctly, you won't feel a thing.

Also how big does metabolism if any play in this waiting game and PWD",1483041220.0

I plan on quitting smoking a G a day habit of BTH and move to Bupe/subs fast taper. While I have to wait that 30ish hrs to take my first dose of Bupe to avoid PWD I would like to try Kratom to make the wait easier. 

*Plan, Take last of my H at night then wake up 8hrs later take some Katom & Benzo my self out hopfully for another 8 hrs, Rinse Repeat until the 30ish hr mark and then take small amount of subs and level out w/o going into PWD. I would love to take lope but heard that could fk with PWD*  

**My Main question is will taking Kratom during the 30ish hr wait still send me into PWD after the 30hr mark clean from H. I've been told that Kratom binds to a diff receptor and will not be kicked off by the bupe resulting in no PWD from the kratom even if taken while waiting.** 

I hope I explained it right this time and any personal exp would be greatly appreciated. The last thing I need is to wait 30ish hrs half sick because i'm taking  Kratom and its doing some of its magic then take the bupe at 30ish hrs and go into PWD because of the kratom.

Drank it, at 5:00 - I think I might have felt something after 45 minutes, went away after 15 mins.
Made another with 9 pills to make sure I'm really in 7% who are unlucky not to feel it.

Here's my dilemma.  I recently purchased a relatively small amount of the A49 OCs (15mg).  My dude that sold them to me, same guy who's always been extremely trustworthy, informed me ahead of time that they were a BLUE-ish color.

Instantly this is a red flag for me... obviously!  Knowing my concerns, he lets me try some, just because I wanted to be safe.  Here's the deal... I've been doing all sorts of OCs for YEARS... At LEAST five years, pretty damn consistently.  Aside from the color, they looks fine, the texture seems on point, they break down as expected, they tasted fine, after doing 5 of them I feel completely as expected.  I am just extremely confused.

Are fakes just getting to be that good where literally EVERYTHING but the color seemed legit?  There were hints of a greenish color, but it was unmistakenly blue-ish in color.  Here's two weird things though.  1)  When broken down for bumping purposes, the color was consistent all throughout the pill.  The reason for mentioning this is originally I had thought maybe something faded or altered the color somehow, but if that was the case, I wouldn't expect it to be that blueish color all the way through.  2) About 30 minutes after bumping the last one (the 5th one), I checked out my OC booger and it was this highlighter (almost neon) green color.  Like a neon yellowish green.  This also leads me to believe that they are fake and that was some sort of a dye.

What do you all think about all of this?  Everything in me is saying, *Oliver, don't be a dummy... they MUST be fake!*

But why would someone fake the 15s?  If they are blue, just change the imprint to say A 51 and call them 30s.  You'd make twice as much money and the color is WAYY closer to what one would think a blue would be.  Also, they feel totally legit, they taste legit, everything looks totally legit.

You all probably know better than I do about fakes.  What's the latest?  Also, I'm from a mid-atlantic state where we enjoy our crabs, just in case that means anything.

Thanks!

I'm doing okay down here. Full disclosure, my mom gave me a few pain meds and I spread them out. I also have some xanax and lots and lots of weed. The amount was nothing compared to my tolerance at home. I'm not sweating very much because, not surprisingly, I brought the cold weather from MI with me. The airport and just being in Detroit was pure hell and that $60 was burning a hole in my pocket. My junkie brain was going a million miles a minute on how I could somehow get to boy without any real transportation. Being stuck in Dope City in those circumstances were very shitty to say the least and the crazy shit I thought of, I'm sure you can imagine. 
I'm sneezing all the time, but surprisingly my stomache was bad for two days and I only felt like I had to vomit one day. RLS is a major, major, major bitch and I do hate to be acquainted with her. I'm pretty restless, and I've been stuck in the hospital for the last two days in a hard chair (I'm not the one in the hospital). 

I'm here until the 2nd, so about 4 more days. I'm really scared that although I'm starting to feel okay and being around my mom helps me a ton, but I feel like being in a different environment is also what is helping me. 

What's going to happen when I land in Dope City, see that everything is dead from winter, it's cold as fuck, my problems are still at home (debt, job, living situation, etc.) and to top it off, I just left my mom. My junkie mind has already told me that I land early enough to get my ride home (I didn't drive and it's about an hour drive) that I have more than enough time to drive myself back up and get some. What the fuck is wrong with me? I just want to be normal, I just want to feel okay, I don't want these mental illnesses and I sure as hell don't want this addiction.

This is awesome in a certain way and makes things easy for the most part, but once the skinny white boy approaches the corner, about halfway down the block im approached by 3 dudes at once (they know me now too cuz im the one with the bridle pit that spends 100 at a time as where most purchases i see are 10-20 dollar crack sales, and a couple dimes of dope at a time)anyways its pretty much the first one i make eye contact with that gets the sale, and i just dont understand how they work that out amongst themselves. like they are all competing over sales but no one gets mad when someone snakes a customer right in front of them? maybe all the money goes up to the same spot and they get payed hourly or something but i really doubt that, and there has to be some kind of award system for who sells more or something, plus there are freelancers all over too. 

ive lived in cities where people get killed over corners, like if someone is dealing within 4 square blocks of the turf, you get dusted and they get their turf back, but these guys are just cool with sharing all the business, its craaazy.

another con to this system is that there ARE some dealers that will either hook it up a little extra (like, spend 40, get 5 bags, or spend 80 an get 4 dubs, a dime and a dime of crack, whatever).. some of them are straight up bag for dollar, and occasionally theres the one guy that has fat fat sacks, and the guy whos product is noticeably stronger. it never amounts to much of a difference but when yer spending as much as i do a day its nice to have an extra dime or two for a wake up the next day, y'know? ill sometimes hit the block looking for one of the exceptional guys, and i cant find him so im swarmed and make the purchase before i have the chance to find the guy, just to turn the corner back to my car and guess who it is? the guy who wouldve made that extra dime happen.

First i would like to say, opiates have always been my drug of choice. At age 14 my drug use became more then weed and alcohol. My grandma had massive amounts of Narco 10's.. Literally massive amounts. At 13 I would sell a few here and there for some weed. At 14 I made the worst decision of my life, I took two. From that point on i was in love. About two months later I decided to try my luck with stimulants. Two and a half adderall 10's. I found out that stimulants made me the person I always wanted to be.

By age 17 I had used every drug you could think of, with the expectation of research chemicals, my list of those isn't that long. Basically what I am getting at is i have always been a huge fan of heroin and meth. Honestly opiates and stimulants in general. I fell in love with each for completely different reasons. Opiates did for me what stimulants couldn't and vise versa. 

I enjoy the effects of opiates more mainly because they make everything okay. The world could be falling apart in front of me, but if I was nodding on some fine heroin I would be convinced that it was okay. No matter what was going on opiates made it okay. Stimulants always made me the person I wish I was 24/7. But I won't ramble about that in this sub.

My favorite drug combo next to LSD and MDMA, is heroin and meth, AKA speedballing. I love to speed ball on these two because I get the full effects of the meth. I like to smoke meth until I feel like what I call ""super me"" the person I want to be daily. I then dose heroin as needed. The speed part of the crystal high is dulled down. I prefer light speed, high euphoria on stims. I get double the euphoria when I combine both. I get the warm blanket of love feeling from the heroin, as well as the false feeling of life being okay. Thus creating my definition of a perfect high.

I have always been both a junkie and a tweaker. I love both drugs as well as the lifestyle of both. If I had to choose, I would be team junkie hands down. I sometimes see tweaker hate posts on this sub, on stims I see junkie hate posts. Let's just get high and get along.

TLDR: I tell a little about my drug use growing up. I describe that I have always enjoyed both opiates and stims for different reasons, but always a junkie at heart. I describe why using heroin and meth to speed ball is a perfect high in my opinion. 

Now for a few questions for my fellow r/opiates friends. 
1: Do you find that you also enjoy stims? If so, do you use them enough to label yourself part tweaker?
2: If you have ever used heroin and meth for a speed ball did you find it enjoyable?

Thanks for taking the time to read this! The few who did anyway lol. Would love to discus these two drug classes in the comments.

 Got surprised with a trip to mexico (wohoo!) and immediately felt a wave of dread realizing there is no way I can detox in time... Luckily I maintain a low tolerance and just 3 oxy 80's could safely get me through the whole trip. I however can not bank on the fact I can probably score down there, it won't be easy with family and I can't take the risk of not being able to find something and getting sick.

  I am debating whether to just casually throw a couple pills in with other meds hidden in plain sight style, or going Mission Impossible style and making them virtually unfindable except for a maximum security prison level search.

  Naturally the thought of the Mexican prison system horrifies me, but with the relaxed drug laws lately and the fact that even Heroin is legal in low amounts makes it seem like i'm not exactly a hot target. However, I can't find any solid info on the legality of various medications, and to what extent they are enforced, as well as if the legal drugs can be brought in to the country and through the airport or not.

Also, I am Canadian, and I guess leaving the Canadian airport is also a factor, I can't remember what the security is like at departure, but I don't think it's very significant.

When you're getting a foot massage by a friend and he starts getting turned on by the veins in your feet. (This has happened to me before. I had a friend who was an IV drug user and he literally got a boner checking out my veins in my feet while giving me a foot rub!)

RAISED EDGES DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY EQUAL FAKES


The REAL genuine Actavis 30mg AND 15mg oxycodone pills imprinted with A215 & A214 DO come with a RAISED EDGE ALONG THE OUTER RIM OF THE PILL, This does not mean they are fake Fentanyl pressed pills. As much as everyone likes to imagine the factory where these pills are made being as 100% perfect and everything inside being uniform and error free, it happens, things sometimes come out looking marginally different than the ones they made a week ago. I have even gotten them from the pharmacy before where the outer edge was sort of messed up when it was pressed in the factory and not a 100% completely clean edge, SHIT HAPPENS. Does anyone else remember like 5-6 years ago when their was a big recall/problem because some pharmaceutical factory messed up when pressing oxycodone pills and some pills had more active ingredient in them than others by as much as a couple milligrams? Even though these pills are made by machines human beings still control those machines and make mistakes, not everything is 100% identical as the last batch. USP and the FDA even leave some margin of error room for the chemists/companies to mess up when it comes to active ingredients/fillers/binders and all that because the margin of error they leave in is so small that it won't have any real effect on anyone and no one would be able to tell otherwise.

I just felt like i needed to set the record straight at very least with these because when i saw that, i was 100% sure that it they were wrong and that they do have edges, sometimes these edges can wear off when the pill is rattled around in the bottle enough or maybe sometimes certain batches just don't have that edge coming out of the factory, like i said people fuck up sometimes and if its not big enough of a fuck up to effect anything/anyone why throw away a whole shipment of pills? But it just seems like lately any time someone posts a large amount of pills for pill porn the first thing everyone seems to do is want to call them fake, like in that post earlier that's still on the front page of this sub, in some cases maybe it is true but in this one it for sure was not.

I am not saying one way or another weather the pills in that post i referred to are real or fake because i have no idea, i was just annoyed that everybody was all of a sudden such an expert on real and fake pills just because they have edges or don't have edges.

I know it can be fairly easy to OD on methadone depending circumstances. I've definitely taken a lot of opiates in the past, even a methadpone pill once but that was many, many years ago. I don't remember the dose from then, but I wanted to make sure a dose of like 15mg or so is pretty safe for someone who is very much not new to opiates. I have not taken any other downers that would interact and am aware of the long duration of the onset and half life so I'm obviously going to be careful. Since I had no crazy reaction when I took it the one time I did and have taken a lot of other stuff in the past, I'm not too worried. I've even seen a couple places that the lethal dose for an adult with no tolerance is around 25mg, so I feel like I should be good taking less. But like I said, I try to be really careful these days and I have found this sub to be very friendly and helpful, so thought I'd come here to make sure there isn't something I should be aware of. Better safe than sorry. Thank you guys for any input.

For extra info, I'm in my mid 20s, 6'1"", about 250lbs, and while I usually take opiates recreationally and would enjoy the buzz (I remember loving methadone when I took it as a kid) I am actually taking this in large part for pain relief now.

I ***highly*** suspect that one of my roommates did it.  I, as well as the other roommate (her BF), have caught her stealing shit from us before; I just don't know where the fuck she put it, and every time you call her out on some shit she just plays the fuckin' victim and tries to make you feel like a piece of shit (she is the fuckin' **worst,** man!)

She *also* will occasionally ask me to hit up a dealer for her and ask for xx amount, then, when we pull up to the spot, she'll just hand me like ***four fucking dollars all folded up super tiny, and try to make ME fuck the dealer over!!***  FORTUNATELY, though, every time this has happened so far I've had enough money on me that I've been able to call the person up again and talk them into a dub for 15, but AS YOU CAN IMAGINE this is really starting to piss me the **fuck** off!

So, here's my question: should I text this dope-girl and warn her about my shitty roommate and keep her from potentially getting ripped off or from buying a gift card that was stolen from me?

Weed/dabs are my drug of choice, and always will be.  I got into opiates (blues) when I was working at a stressful, demanding, social job for a few months; and to psychologically wean myself off of them (wasn't physically addicted) I started on Kratom.

I'd say I've been taking it daily, with maybe a 3 or 4 days off, in the past 2 months.  It helped my back pain, helped my anxieties, depression, it was a godsend.  Combined with dabs, it was even better.  I found a great combo.  But lately... it's turned against me.

At first, I thought it was the dabs.  People talk about cannabis giving them anxiety, even long time smokers can have it happen to them suddenly.  So I did an experiment: Just took Kratom that day, no caffeine, and no cannabis.  And after about an hour of taking the Kratom, my heart was pounding, I was getting unnaturally cold, and I felt incredibly restless and uneasy.

After about an hour of pacing back and forth in my room, I decided to take a dab to see if that would calm me down.  It didn't, it made me overthink and become more aware of my rapid heartbeat, and went into panic mode.  I was able to calm myself down eventually.

The next day, I took the experiment to the next obvious level: no Kratom.  So for most of the day just took dabs.  No caffeine, no Kratom, just cannabis extracts.  And all was well, I was really stoned most of the day, until my curious mind went to work: ""Take a gram of Kratom, see what it does.""  I'm crazy, I know, but I had to.  I had to see if the Kratom was causing this anxiety.

It was 6:00 pm at this point, and I'd nearly smoked a half gram of oil by this time of the day so I was fairly baked.  I weighed out one gram of the kratom powder and plopped it into my OJ.

And just as I fucking guessed, once it kicked in, chills, rapid heartbeat, spinning thoughts, can't sit still.  The opposite of baked.

Conclusion: I'm now on day 2 of no Kratom.  And planning on keeping that going.  I miss getting stoned and relaxing, or doing stuff.  But recently combining cannabis with kratom has given me crippling anxiety, so I'm taking a break from kratom indefinitely.

Has anyone else experienced Kratom anxiety?  Ps: I've never taken more than 4 grams in a day.

**TL;DR: Kratom is giving me crippling anxiety; then mixing with cannabis makes it unbearable and makes me feel like I'm going to die of heart failure.**",1483128878.0

Me and my gf wanna bring in the new year getting by getting as high as possible with what we have, that being a bunch of kratom and some buprenorphine (we are part of the few who enjoy it recreationally). I know it would probably be a waste to take the kratom after the buprenorphine, but what if we do the kratom first, enjoy what it has to offer, and then mix in the bupe second? Anyone ever try something like this? 

I don't really care if the kratom high gets dulled out by the bupe, my main concern is the bupe high will get messed up, cause this is our last little bit of it and we have no way of getting more.

Personal experience is preferred, but any hypothesizing is always appreciated.

Thanks and happy new year",1483128754.0

However it is pretty hectic and things worked out for me anyway so all good!

Righto so here's the story, had called dboy yesterday to see if he could front me bag till Monday but said how he couldn't do it as bills to pay etc. However after finding out I could get paid today phoned to try sort out a g if I get paid, said I would need to call back in a few hours (this was about 4ish) as he was needing to reup. So called back after work and explained how I hadn't been paid yet and asked again if he could front me bag till tomos as I will be paid by then at the latest, didn't check date yday and for some reason thought it would be Monday (probly cos I didn't think would be in city till then) as it turns out I'm actually off till wed now woot woot!

Anyways he explains that he could do it (still owe him fiver from other day) however if I don't pay him back tomorrow I'll be fucked and not able to get tick (front a bag) in the future. So here's to hoping I do indeed get paid tonight/tomorrow at latest, will be heading back into city to pay back the £20 and get a gram for the wonderfully low price of £20!

Please help!!!,"Long story short, I am old to opiates but relatively new to IVing. I recently got clean so my tolerance is insanely low right now. I just copped from my usual plug who only sells shit cut with fent (hands down best dope I've EVER done by a fucking landslide) but today he gave me some darker shit. Not bad, but not up to his usual standard. Anyway, I'm trying to stay away from the needle. Snorting a tiny bit of the fentanyl still gets me super high, but not with this regular dope. So I wanna try plugging it. 

Never done this before, so can you guys give me some tips? Opinions? How much should I plug? Do I need to stick it really far up in there? Should I just do however much I would do if I was gonna do a shot? Do you actually get a rush? How is it exactly compared to shooting and snorting? Help would be greatly appreciated! ",1483124090.0
