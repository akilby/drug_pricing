And I feel like that that's just part of life when you live in a capitalistic Society which right now I feel like it's as good as it gets of course that's not to say it can't be improved and that it isn't being improved but I really feel like it's as good as it gets. But that's something that we has Americans don't think about has a whole too much is that in this country we inherently have the right to be informed. Now I I don't think that necessarily mean you will be informed. I feel like we have to do the leg work. Since the Advent of the internet there's been a lot harder war of information you have to siphon through disinformation and misinformation to find it basically if you want to be informed of a subject a lot of people are talking about it today. I also feel like that as Americans we have the right to choose which is something that other people in countries don't necessarily get to the scope that we do.  I just feel like that's the duality of a Democratic Society the fact that you are going to have things products push up on you because it's a capitalistic Society but that if you want to find out the truth about something, whether you need it or not, would it be good for you.  you have the right to be informed and make that choice. There is a war to control the information you get and the decisions you make on a daily basis but I feel like thank God I live in America which at its core,  although it may not seem like it sometimes, encourages get yourself informed and make a decision based on the information that you receive. Something else I feel as Americans is it's our duty to be informed and it's our duty to make the best decision for ourselves, that's how a democracy evolves,  because the man ain't going to do it for us. I know the man sounds cliche but mankind has been fighting the man since the dawn of time. I think that's something that all human beings have in common is being under the thumb of the man , whether we realize it or not. It's like the powers-that-be fight to get you to give up the right of being informed and making decisions but if you focus your willpower into learning what's right and wrong for you in life and making the decision that's best for the life you want to live you can get it in this country.  it's not easy and the man ain't going to make it any easier but it can be done. I was watching the podcast that was talking about censorship of the internet and how the internet is inherently metastasizing against censorship and that when the government finds one way to censor the internet will always find a way around it I believe that too and I believe with every bout of censorship that we have more people will want the right to be informed and to make better decisions for themselves because it's easy to tell a liar after you've been around a long enough and with the access of information speeding up so much with the Advent of technology and the internet the rate at which people learn to be informed and make decisions is increasing exponentially.  I do believe technology is a dual sided sword it can be really really powerful sometimes.",1552195160.0

i always thought of drugs like methadone and buprenorphine as 'worse than heroin' since they last longer and you hear all these horror stories about how its just trading addiction

i went to a clinic a few months ago and got prescribed buprenorphine (just had to sign up, my script costs like 8 pounds a month), i dont need to use heroin at all since it masks the withdrawals-- nor do i have any real urge to use. i take 4mg a day (compared to smoking up to a gram a day just to feel normal) and im not kidding myself that im 'sober'-- im on an opiod and realize that. Only now i can live a normal life, im no longer spending my youth laying in bed unconscious or withdrawing... i barely managed to stay afloat in university while using, but i should now be on track for a high (enough) grade overall. I also workout again, and have gained back alot of my muscle (i was a bodybuilder before i was a junkie-- the bupe also does enough to mask my back pain that was usually my excuse to relapse)

before going to the clinic i had tryed to wean myself off heroin a few times using buprenorphine, tapered over a week or so-- the withdrawals were much more bearable. though id just end up relapsing like aways... so here i am xD

I hear a lotta people talk about how after getting addicted to opiates you stop liking weed, which is true for me too. But why is this? For me it‚Äôs because ever since opiate addiction started for me weed makes me overthink so much. It‚Äôs also the fact that I‚Äôm a drug addict that makes my high a lot less enjoyable because I find myself overthinking it and getting lost in my thoughts about the fact that I‚Äôm a  heroin addict. And this whole thing just makes me very anxious and sad. Weed also makes me see the bad side of everything.

So did you stop liking weed (if you did beforehand) after getting addicted to opiates? If so what is different about weed now that makes you not like it?

My friend explained that these dreams are interpreted as using the opiates because your brain is kickstarting the receptors and repairing them- thus anything released by those receptors that the opiates once mimicked and burned out, are manifesting themselves in dreams of using as they serve similar functions.  

At face value, I thought this was intriguing and maybe possible.  Is there any truth to my friend‚Äôs claims?  I‚Äôm still a little skeptical...but even if this becomes an exercise in placebo, I suppose it could be beneficial as when a dependent has a dream, they could interpret it as healing rather than a calling to relapse that they should give into. 

TL;DR a friend says opiate using dreams after quitting are the brain healing and producing the chemicals that opiates initially replaced. The dreams are a sign of healing. True?",1552161346.0

I hope what is by and large a very mild romance with oxy may serve as a cautionary story to anyone who, like me until yesterday, thought doing oxy was no big deal. Bits of my story might sound familiar as I did post here sometimes when I was convincing myself that what I was doing was okay. 

‚ÄúI always said I‚Äôd never touch opiates. I‚Äôve had family friends, friends parents, etc die from them over the years. I never understood the appeal of nodding out, or how someone could trick themselves into thinking they wouldn‚Äôt get addicted. 

Then about two weeks ago, I ran out of weed. Yes, running out of weed mentally gave me the go ahead to start taking oxy. Because I didn‚Äôt take it as seriously as I should have and now I‚Äôm paying for it. What‚Äôs the big deal, I told myself. How much can a tiny little pill change your life? Obviously everyone else was making out to be a much bigger deal than it was. Luckily for me though, I don‚Äôt have a dealer, and my supply is limited and I don‚Äôt have regular access. 

What started as 7.5mg of oxy the first time I tried it has turned into 25-35mg within under two weeks trying to chase that high. According to everyone those are low doses, but I am already feeling the damage I‚Äôve done to myself, mostly psychologically as far as I can tell. Terrified I‚Äôm going to go to sleep one night and never wake up, leading me to deprive myself of sleep. 

Yesterday I successfully took only 15mg of oxy. I have a feeling I know what most people might say about tapering, but I think it‚Äôs the best way to ease myself out while I‚Äôm not in too deep. Today I‚Äôm only taking 10mg. I don‚Äôt even want to. I don‚Äôt even want to be high. Honestly, it wasn‚Äôt even ever a fun high to me, it wasn‚Äôt ever really enjoyable it was just... nothingness. 

I‚Äôm sick of scheduling my day or lack thereof at this point around a fucking pill I don‚Äôt even enjoy at this point. No one knows I‚Äôve been taking it, no one knows anything about my habit. I can‚Äôt believe I did this to myself, especially the profound ignorance in the reason I started and the lies I told myself. Not even two weeks and I might have just lost a really good job opportunity because I can‚Äôt function right now. 

I can‚Äôt even differentiate between what‚Äôs potentially real withdrawal and what‚Äôs my mind making it up. I swear so much in my sleep last night, keep having hot flashes, I just feel like shit. I‚Äôm more sad now than going through anything physical. 

I just want out. ‚Äú

Everyone can downvote all they want, I expect that. I wrote that when I was so panicked and hysterical I could barely breathe‚Äî I know my withdrawal is psychological, not physical. My point of this post is to show anyone thinking of trying it how bad you can fuck yourself up psychologically in a short span on time on a low dose of oxy. The absolute hysteria I have catapulted myself into at my own volition. And this isn‚Äôt even the tip of the iceberg. I can‚Äôt even see the tip from where I am.

Alright, so I go into this rehab place about 2 days after this guy came in. There's 3 characters in this story. Me, D (the heroin fella and roommate), and M (my other roommate.

We were in rooms with 4 beds each, all of them occupied at the time including me.

I was the youngest person there, really still a kid at the time, everyone else was 22-48 so it was difficult to talk to people. D talked to me like he was already my friend, he seemed nice. But everything got weird quickly. I saw D and a some other guy (from another room) going out the emergency exit door a few times, and one of these times D grabs something from M's drawer when he wasn't there. I don't care at first. Maybe M doesn't mind D going in his drawers? D kept saying things along the lines of ""you don't wanna get stuck up in this room, you should try to go make some friends"". Seemed nice, but I'm sure he just wanted me to leave so he could do something.

Alright, so let's get to the good shit. One night he was clipping his toenails way past lights-out time. It took him about 20 minutes to finish. I'm not sure if he was high as fuck or what. Another night I wake up to piss and he's in the dark just hunched over the desk snorting lines of.... Something? He doesn't realize I'm up until I'm right next to him and he freaks the fuck out. But I just walk right past him and go piss and come back to sleep. 

Well a few days pass and he fails a drug test so he's kicked out. M has been a great friend of mine for the past couple of days, and it seems now like he's talking trash about D, so he must not like him. So I ask M ""did you let D go in your drawers? cause D did that a while ago"". The answer was something along the lines of ""oh shit, no I don't, why?""

We tell the administrators and they go search the room. They find a turkey baster attached to a horse syringe needle and it was filled with dope and blood. Seriously it was huge. It probably would've held an ounce of liquid or more.

We're not sure if they had some sort of massive tolerance or if their plan was to just cook up once and shoot up just a little bit at a time while hiding the half-full needle in M's drawers. It made sense to me cause cooking up every day is risky. (ideas on exactly what they were doing would be appreciated) So not only did they do this, but they stole the horse syringe, a spoon, a turkey baster, a lighter from the shop house, and probably some other stuff just to do it.
 

And of course, to top it all off, they both got Hepatitis from the needle. 


tl;dr 

roommate hid heroin in another roommate's drawers without consent. he built a rig out of a massive turkey baster and a needle from a horse syringe (or maybe the whole thing was just a horse syringe, idk). I scared the shit out of him while he was sniffing lines at midnight.


Edit: looks like it was probably just a simple horse syringe. either the first or second largest in this picture are both accurate representations of what I saw, except they had a needle on it. https://ii.bigdweb.com/fcgi-bin/iipsrv.fcgi?FIF=/images/bigdweb/source/130-9.tif&wid=400=&cvt=jpeg",1552153090.0

I've been battling this thing for 5ish years now and it's been a rocky road to say the least. I got out of my umpteenth rehab October of 2018 and have been able to function since then. Going on a couple runs for a week or so here and there and then more recently chipping over the weekends.

I have found it so hard to stay away from opiates because of sheer boredom. I'm in a relatively new town and dont know many people outside of AA (and I'm not a huge fan of those people for other reasons). I can come how from work or school and find it really daunting to pass the time until the next day. I just smoke hella weed and take etiz.

Anyway, as usual my middle hit me up asking if I want my normal weekend routine and i had to say no. I'm visiting home next week and dont want anything to jeporadize that. I made this thread in hopes someone else decides to break the routine a bit.

Love yall",1552147965.0

My mum got fired a while back for taking prescription painkillers for pain in her shoulder and being visibly affected by them on the job, IDK how they noticed that she'd taken them, she just said that they found out about it and had to let her go. She got them from a friend, they were not on her prescription.

&#x200B;

This was like a year ago.

&#x200B;

I've noticed that she sometimes acts weird, a bit like a different person at times. I thought that she might be bipolar type 2 and that what I saw was hypomania. Lately I've started to suspect that she's taken something when she acts like this. Her pupils aren't very big so I rule out amphetamine. She has wounds here and there from itching and she's been complaining about pain in her back and shoulder for a while (she's just very sickly in general, her body is not doing too well). 

&#x200B;

I'm suspecting that she's gotten opiates from her ""friend"" again. 

&#x200B;

What do you guys think?

The weird way she's acting in is like this:

Goes on for 1-4 days

She CONSTANTLY makes sounds, like humming on sounds, snorting sound (outwards, not inwards like snoring)

seems a bit disoriented and confused but certain that nothing is wrong when I confront her

Always seems to be ""on a mission"", like she's gonna do something, but she doesn't have to do something she just acts as if she has stuff to do, like walking around, picking stuff up and moving them etc.

&#x200B;

Idk it's hard to describe her way of acting.. But yeah I'd appreciate any help I can get.",1552143238.0

One I remember is when my mom first saw needle marks on my arm. She grabbed my wrist , looked, and started crying. 

That blew me away, because never had I ever seen my mother cry.

I remember thinking, if I wasn‚Äôt a junkie before, I sure am now.

Things didn't go well after that. I became a little heroin punk, hanging out in clubs and pretending I was a real adult, which I definitely was not. 

Later, when I was older, I no longer had time for that. Because I had to hustle up the money to go cop and I had to get there before the police changed shift at 7:30 am. That was always fun, because I would get up sick and if it took me even 30 minutes longer than planned, things were going to get really real. 

I wish I could have quit because my family wanted me to.

I wish I could have quit for my friends. These were guys I absolutely loved and they were not gonna tolerate me shooting dope. We had a long tradition of hanging out, doing whatever drugs we could get our hands on (but not heroin) getting stupid drunk and dancing like idiots and just generally be young guys. So I lost them a long time ago.

Then there was the subject of relationships. I was interested in a disinterested sort of way. I would meet someone from time to time, and we might chat and there might be a spark or two, but in the end, it just was not worth it. Sort of like if I was a paraplegic and other people were running marathons. Why get involved? For what reason? It was not gonna end well.

I wasted so much time with dope. There is no other word for it. 

I really thought I needed heroin and that it was the only thing for me. I wanted it worse than I ever wanted anything else, and I did extraordinary things to get it. 

The thing was, it was all bullshit. Somehow, the dope wormed its way into my head and convinced me that I could only be happy when I was doing a shot. And that was kind of true, for maybe a year. It was not so much that I was happy as it was that I was feeling no pain.

It literally muted life for me. It flipped that switch to the OFF position. And the longer I did dope, the longer life needed to be muted. I so looked forward to getting that fire shot. Then I would do it, and I would be feelin it, but it just was not right. My problems were not going away anymore. 

And if you can‚Äôt trust your dope to make your problems go away, who can you trust?

Sadly, I am the only one who can make my problems go away. And the only way to do that was to get clean. Damn. Who saw that coming?

One day, enough was enough and I was stopping right the fuck now. No more bullshit excuses. Yes, it is going to hurt. You can do it.

It did hurt. Really bad. And what I realized was that I was never going to be strong enough to handle opiates. They were always going to win and the only way to not lose was to not fight.

I might be wrong, but I don't think I'll ever use again. ",1552133492.0

Ban me or whatever you want but from my personal perspective almost every death I've experienced in my life was opiate related. Not cancer, drinking and driving, smoking, coke, old age, Whatever. Fucking opiates. ",1552106214.0

So when we do drugs like opiates it sends a flood of dopamine in our brains, right? So when the drugs are done, and we go thru withdrawals, it's because of the lack of enough dopamine and/or serotonin, correct? 

So the depression, anxiety etc. Is due to low serotonin from our body's not being able to make enough of its own because it's used to the opiates creating it 

So let's say if every time we did drugs and it flooded our brains with dopamine. After the high is all said and done and our brains werent so depleted of its own serotonin, would be still go thru withdrawals or get addicted? 

TL;DR: our brains creates its own dopamine, if our brains didn't get so deleted of dopamine from constant usage of opiates, would be still go thru withdrawals or get addicted? ",1552102246.0

However, on top of that, he's taking 1mg of alprazolam to help him sleep. This is somewhat an old habit of his, maybe for the last \~1 and a half years.

Is he in danger? Will these medications interact?

I just discovered TODAY that his taking both, and this (tramadol whole day + alprazolam to sleep) has been going for like 2 weeks. Until now he's ok, some difficult to breathe, but that may be the tumor.

Also, what could substitute the alprazolam? We live in Brazil and it's really easy to get access to controlled drugs (e.g. he bought the alprazolam just going to the pharmacy lol).",1552099416.0

last night I spent my last 40 to cop and its gone already..it was supposed to last until at least saturday night.

im struggling to not transfer cash from my savings to get more dope...i have a nice amount saved up and i am struggling to not give in an dip into it....

im turning 40 next month and want to be done with this endless ratrace and makin my dealer rich ....but the mental addiction and temptation is waaaay to much and i find myself on autopilot to go and cop....i chip so i cop maybe twice a week...spending about 400+ on dope every month...using half to a gram on each run...snorting

ive never had physical withdrawals but my anxiety get fucked when i dont have dope...im irritable and hate life and find no pleasure in doing things while not on dope.

I cant get it off my mind...and i really need to let this shit go...im tired of hiding it from my wife and my daughter is almost 6 months old...my goal is to be done by april 1st..

am i a complete shitbag if i dip into the saving and cop?  i want to delete my plugs number but i cant imagine life without my fix...its like the one thing i really enjoy...

dont get me wrong...i love my family...and i know what im doing is wrong...i dont have anyone i can talk to about this  and i feel like im going to fuck up and end up copping...

i last copped on saturday..$50....then another $40 last night....and now im thinking of coppin another 100 worth with money im not supposed to spend...i

im just ranting butni guess this is a cry for help or support or just approval to go ahead and fuck up as long asbi have a plan to really quit..(ive reset my NOMO countless times)

all i keep thinking is ""its just another 100 bucks....we'll put it back""....my mind is repeating that scene from Requiem where they keep dippin into the shoebox....

fuck...i feel like im already going to fuck up and give on...shit im even tempted to leave work early today to cop...my saturdays are shitty if i wake up without dope...im bouncing off walls and frantic from the moment i wake up...

ive got one more month....and then this has to fuckin stop...im tired of this merrygoround and want off....but having access to this cash is fuckin me up...

to cop or not to cop....that is the question...

fuuuuuuck i cant turn off the voices in my head

i guess im just lookin for some kind of support here ..sorry if this is a bitchy shit post.....ill be sitting here checkin my phone for orange envelopes like im waitong for the dopeman to hit me back and say its all good...

any words would help right now....thanks for reading..

temptation is a bitch on her period....

Well, after busting down several walls, climbing a few fences, and scaling a couple buildings, I think it's time to give it a rest for a while.

TL;DR I was about to die to my addiction, did a 180, got clean and I'm happier than ever.

Anyway, 4 months ago I had a meta realization that my life was falling completely apart and that I was fooling myself into thinking it was fine. I was stealing money, selling whatever I could, doing whatever I could, to get my shit. I was doing 13-15 30mg oxys a day. I was destroying my nasal passages and my life/relationships.
Suicide crossed my mind almost daily. I was so miserable and was barely existing let alone living. The entirety of my days consisted of trying to find money or pull some scheme to get well. I put on a good act though, as none of my friends or family knew. Finally one day I reached my limit. I was sick for almost 3 days, had no money.  Hadn't eaten in a few days. Hadn't showered, hadn't slept. 
I just stayed locked in my room crying and sweating and sick. My body actually felt like it was shutting down, I could feel the life being stripped from my soul, literally. I sat with a loaded gun in my hands just looking at it and thumbing around with it deciding what to do. I felt like such a coward in that moment. Not because I hadn't pulled the trigger yet, but because I didnt want to exist anymore. 
While I was contemplating how to do it, my mother called me, (i told her i had been feeling under the weather) 
She told me my aunt called her and told her 
""Tell ____ everything is okay, I'm not sure why but I have this feeling that he needs to know everything is going to be fine and that hes not alone. Tell him I love him and that whatever hes going through, he can do it""
I started crying even heavier and begged my mother to come over without really telling her why. When she got to my place i explained everything. Literally everything. She was mad/upset/every other emotion imaginable, but she said we could take care of it together. And that I didnt have to do any of it alone. She called so many places for me looking for somewhere to take me. And found an outpatient place that could see me the next day. I went and started subs that day. 
It's been 4 months on subs and I haven't looked back once. Haven't had a single relapse or even a thought to do so. You couldnt pay me to go back to that. 
I have a job, I have friends I see daily, I actually laugh and genuinely smile. Im starting to remember all the positives that life has to offer. Having come through all of this has forced a new perspective on life Into me. I now realize how precious life is, and how important interaction/relationships can be.
My dr holds classes/meetings for patients/addicts/families of addicts/ and anyone that wants to show up. I recently started leading some of them and it feels amazing. I'm going on a podcast next week to tell a more detailed version of this and more details about before I was clean and the entire process. 

I never thought I'd be clean. I figured I would die with a crushed Roxy in my nose. I used to read this sub and all the posts of people saying ""if I can get clean anyone can"" and scoff at them. But I understand now. And it is actually true, any of us can get clean. Not everyone wants to, and that's fine. But if you want to, you absolutely can. If you made it this far, thankyou for reading all of this. I missed you guys and it's nice to be back. Love you all <3

Now I need a game plan.,"I have destroyed my marriage and my wife. She never deserved this. I feel lower then low right now. I have never been this low in my life.

What I thought would never happen to me has finally happened. I overdosed. What started out as a Kratom habit finally lead up to a near fatal overdose in just one year after being clean for 5. I suspected something was wrong with the dope because it was so white. I actually thought it was fake. Guess I was wrong. My wife literally saved my life by calling 911.

I just finally got out of the hospital and here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at: My wife is most likely going to divorce me. I don‚Äôt blame her with the constant lies and sneaking behind her back. This was her last straw. She has always been up front about drugs since the start. I have not. If we stay together I will just keep doing more damage to her. I know I‚Äôm going to receive something negative feedback for hurting and scaring such an innocent person multiple times. I take full responsibility for my actions.

I was also thinking I should literally check myself into an outpatient program ASAP like, later today when they open. How do you guys feel about that? Any past experiences?

While being escorted out of my apartment. I remember what seemed like 50 people scattered around outside my building as well as  multiple fire trucks, ambulances and cop cars. Mostly cops, medical personal and a few of my neighbors so I‚Äôm definitely at risk of being evicted. I learned that apartment complexes can request information regarding tenants being carried away in an ambulance. Any comments?

I was also curious. At the hospital, after the Drs and other paramedics were done doing their thing. A woman came in with a computer, asked me a bunch of questions and the. asked me to sign something. I guess it was a consent form? Well, since I had no idea what I was signing I refused. I asked her for a print out. She said ‚Äúsure no problem, let me get that for you, one second‚Äù and then she disappeared and was never seen again. Maybe she forgot? Does anyone know what or who that signature was for exactly?

So I call my guy who currently lives out of country but has guys in the US who run his business. I asked for 100 bag of brown and 50 bag of white. The driver gets here and only gave me white but I thought it was the dope so I was fine with getting no coke. But I open it and turns out he only gave me white. Now I‚Äôm sick af and the last thing I want is coke, I need dope, so I text my guy immediately and ask him to send him back but he said I had to go meet him.

So he sends me address and I go there. I sit there waiting on a side street in the ghetto next town over from me. I ask him again where to go and he sends me an address right down the street so I go there. This Spanish kid comes up to my car and I ask who he‚Äôs waiting for. He said ‚Äú(blank)‚Äù and I said oh me too! Can I wait with you? (Afraid that I wasn‚Äôt gonna be able to meet the driver again but I thought oh well they‚Äôre coming to this guy next so I‚Äôll definitely be able to meet them now)

I soon realize he speaks zero fucking English and he calls my guy out of country (who speaks English but not perfectly) and he tells me I need to give him more money if I want the brown. I tell him I‚Äôll give the white back if he can give me the brown but we weren‚Äôt understanding eachother for some reason. Eventually I just say ‚Äúhey can I just pay you the rest tomorrow‚Äù and he says ok that‚Äôs fine. 

But I keep asking him when the driver is coming and tell him I‚Äôm with the dude the drivers going to next. The kid finally hands me the bag of dope after all of us going back and forth for like 10 minutes.  (I didn‚Äôt realize he was trying to hand me something this whole time but I couldn‚Äôt understand him) and I finally realize that this was the dude I was supposed to meet to get the brown! But I thought I was meeting the  driver who came to me before.

This whole time we both keep calling the guy and he keeps trying to tell me that the dope is IN THIS KIDS HAND! I was like OHHHHHHH okay...so since the time I met the kid to the time I left, it took at least 30 minutes of him sitting in my car and us both calling my guy back and forth and me trying to communicate with this Spanish kid who speaks no English at all. I was so relieved when he handed me that bag but I felt so stupid for this process taking so long. But after he hands me the bag he kept asking me for the money and I kept trying to explain that I already paid. So he calls the guys AGAIN and I talk to him and tell him to tell this kid the deal with me already paying and paying the rest tomorrow, so basically the translate for me. So finally he does and I‚Äôm all set. I wish he told me that the kid walking was the dude who had my dope. I thought he was just another person buying off of them waiting for the driver but turns out he‚Äôs one of his dealers lol I just wish he spoke a word of fucking English it would‚Äôve been so much easier.

Sorry if I didn‚Äôt explain this good, it was a very complicated situation, but I was sick as fuck which made it 10 times worse. Got my dope tho so I‚Äôm cool with it all lol


Side note: I thought the kid came up to my window because he thought I was the driver. Turns out the whole time he was just trying to sell me the fucking bag lol ",1552042956.0

In the last week, my life has been turned upside down. Here‚Äôs a little background for context. I am 28 years old, and have been in and out of sobriety since I was 17. I went to a 90 day treatment in January of 2018. I stayed sober for a little over eight months, and in that time, I had so many awesome changes than ever before in my life. My girlfriend of nine years and I purchased a brand new home, I left an awesome career for an even better one, and my relationships with my family and friends were getting better than ever before. I relapsed on oxycodone that we‚Äôre literally sitting out on the bathroom sink at my girlfriend‚Äôs grandparents house. Since then, it‚Äôs been a constant struggle to stay sober. My girlfriend would find out, then I would get sober again for a month or so, and relapse again. 

For the last four months I‚Äôve pretty much been using full time, but switched from pills to smoking heroin about a month ago. Even during this time I was keeping everything hidden very well, and things were looking up in my relationship and in my career. 

My girlfriend, we‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúClaire‚Äù, is the absolute light of my life. I have basically grown up with her, and she is simply incredible. She does not use drugs at all, and rarely drinks. Her family had a lot of substance abuse problems, and it just turned her off of it. She has been with me through it all. She‚Äôs saved my life on multiple occasions during overdoses, and his been nothing but supportive and loyal even when I felt like I didn‚Äôt deserve it. When I went to treatment this last time, she was introduced to Al-anon, basically a 12 step program for the families of alcoholics and addicts. They really focus on stopping enabling behavior. I think it has really helped her not take my drug use personally, and there isn‚Äôt anything that she can do to keep me sober, I have to do the work. 

This past weekend I was sleeping in a little bit on Saturday morning, and she looked in my Jean pocket it‚Äôs from the night before and found my stash. I was being very careless because normally I would keep that hidden in my car. She woke me up crying and heartbroken and told me I had to leave. It broke my heart to see her so hurt. She told me she knows not to take it personally, but it just hurts because she thought I was finally sober. She also told me that her heart breaks for me and it hurts for her to watch me struggle with this. It was really emotional when I was packing up my things, getting ready to leave the beautiful home we had saved up for for years knowing we were done. Claires set very clear boundaries with me after the last relapse, and one of those were that we had to be done. She couldn‚Äôt handle going through this anymore. I completely understand, and she deserves so much better. 

After we set our goodbyes and I left the house, I went straight to my dealers house and actually injected heroin. I was so distraught and sad. This beautiful life that we have worked so hard for seemed to be crashing down. She let my sponsor and parents know that she found heroin on me, and all of them reached out to me to let me know they loved me, but I had to figure this out on my own this time. I have been staying in a hotel since then, crying myself to sleep every night. From the outside looking in, it seems so simple. Just don‚Äôt use drugs, in the whole world is yours. It‚Äôs just not that simple for some reason. This addiction has made me hate myself. Even though I am somewhat successful (not trying to be braggy), I feel that if I was not an addict, I could be so much further ahead in life. It seems like opiates have ruined relationships with people who love me and are loyal to me, but for some reason I am more loyal to the opiates than my loved ones. I am getting the keys to an apartment tomorrow, and I am in the process of moving some stuff around at work so I can take a week off at the end of this month to detox. What hurts is that even if I get sober again and stay sober, I don‚Äôt know that Claire and I will get back together. I think I have just hurt her too much at this point. She has been checking on me regularly, and has been nothing but loving and supportive. But she still is sticking to her boundaries of us not being together. 

I really want to get this monkey off my back, and not have it run my life like it has since I was 14 years old. This is all I know, and while I would like to believe that I am a pretty high functioning addict, this lifestyle is not sustainable for me. If you pray or meditate, please keep me in your thoughts and prayers. I will keep you all in mine. Again, I‚Äôm sorry for this long and rambling post, I just had to talk this out somewhere. I love you all, and I hope you all find true love and happiness in your lives.

All of my veins, at least any that are accessible to me on my hands, forearms, upper chest/shoulders have died off one by one. The ones I know still to be there are surrounded by enough scar tissue to bend a needle 90 degrees if i twist or move that area in the slightest...  

The last few days have been hellacious. I‚Äôm wondering if maybe it‚Äôs just time to switch to the longer needle, if that will even help...  the rigs I‚Äôve been using forever(.5cc 31g 8mm) ...now that generally I have a fresh rig every time I fix... this somehow hasn‚Äôt helped near as much as it normally does when I get a fresh box. 

My arms are wrecked, you guys. Years and years of this I believe has sort of killed the nerve endings around where I hit so it seems like if and when I‚Äôm missing, pushing through or off by just a smidge, I don‚Äôt even feel it until its way too late.  

Getting anything to register properly has never been so difficult. It has been an extremely frustrating week. It‚Äôs bad enough that I‚Äôm planning a hiatus on subutex starting tomorrow. I figure taking a few days break for all the swelling to subside can‚Äôt hurt.

Whether like above board or underground? There was a piece on NPR tonight about it and it lead me to do some reading. I saw that these types of guided trips have been used to treat alcoholism and to help people quit smoking in the past with a surprising rate of success. This got me wondering if it would have the same type of success for opiate addiction or if it would be less successful because of the theory some people have that ""a drink is a drug is a man"" or ""a drug is a drug no matter which one it may be"" or however it goes. I've never really been a believer in this theory considering that the 8 years clean time I had I was on bupe maintenance and I have always been able to drink in moderation, and  I have never had a problem turning down uppers or other drugs that I dont enjoy, leading me to believe that my poison is my poison, not all drugs are automatically the same. Does that even make sense? I have to wo dr why these trials were done on alcoholics and not drug addicts in the first place and if that is the reason or if there is another reason that I am overlooking. 
Also I am just curious if anybody has had experience with this in general and if it was successful. I am looking for a way out not just of addiction but in terms of depression as well and it seems like these kinds of treatments could have real potential to be successful where antidepressants fail.

Because my little brother gave me half of his last hit I gave him my last sandwich.

Out of Nowhere my brother turned blue and started to shake violently.

First I realised he was choking and having a seizure.

I did my best and 5 minutes of heimlich maneuver to make him spit out that nasty bite.

He was still shaking mad so i gave him a heart massage and shouted his name. Without results.

His eyes looked horrifying, My Hands grabbed his underweight body and put him into a safe position so he cant choke on his vomit.

After 15 Minutes he started to react to my crying calls...finally...

He was still shaking and almost unconcious.. Trying my best to calm him down I gave him a Heart massage because his breathing was still slow.

Never been so scared..

Suddenly he came back and didnt realised what happened.

He could barely speak but was getting better.. 

Gave him water, some hugs and kisses and he was over the mountain...

Im so glad hes alive..

took half of his dope as an reward and smoked it..

Still processing what the fuck happened..

Is it because he was coming down of the coke into a massive heroin high? Was it because the Pregabalin? he smoked alot and doesnt have a opiate tolerance like I do...

I quit my job cause i used all the time there and was where i got my dope from (co worker). I got ready to cold turkey and get through the hell week that is withdrawal. The only meds i got to help out was some xanax and a few addys so i didnt totaly zonk out on the xans. At this point i was using anywhere from 1 to 2 1/2 buns a day so i was expecting pretty serious withdrawals since i had been sick before obviously i knew what i was about to endure. I dont remember the exact doses i was taking per day but i kept waiting for the withdrawals to hit me hard. After one week when i ran out of my meds i had experienced none of the symptons i was used to feeling other than being fatigued a lot. No muscle aches, no nausea, no diarrhea, no insomnia, no sweats or shaking, absolutely nothing. The weirdest shit ever but i just took it as some type of sign that it was time for me to quit and has helped me to stay strong and stay clean. Idk why this happened but i am grateful and just wanted to let you guys know that its possible to get through this you just have to want it and be done with the lifestyle of forever hustling to get high and avoid the sickness.

I had a ruptured disk at the L5-S1 level that smashed the nerve and I worked with it like this for a year as a server and kept working lifting weights. I could rep 405lbs deadlifting so I was really lifting ok. I‚Äôm strong, 33years old, and tough but this took me from aspiring bodybuilder to a weeping baby in a wheelchair because of the nerve damage. A microdiscectomy, PLIF L5-S1 fusion, 2nerve block injections, 10epidurL inkections, 12 triggerpoint injections, Countless hours of PT, and ongoing pshycological treatment later I‚Äôm now waiting on insurance approval for the Senza HF-10 spinal cord stimulator implant to try to help the pain since they absolutely will not increase my medication because I‚Äôm ‚Äúto young‚Äù. All this coupled with the fact that she is cutting one dose a day off of my breakthrew medication either way. She gave me the choice and I said whatever she thinks is fine. I do not abuse my medication and actually end up with several extra pills each month. At one point I had an epidural that was so perfect it controlled my pain almost 100% and I VOLUNTEERALLY went off of the embeda 100% for 3 months. After the epidural wore off I had to go back on the embeda. They told me I was the first person in the history of the practice to volunteer to drop a narcotic medication lol. With this being said I am not worried about the euphoria or high or any of that crap when I ask this question. Is this change going to be terrible? Or could it help? Thoughts? Questions concerns? Also I forgot to mention I take 200mg Lyrica for the neuropathy down the leg",1552011516.0

aykzn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aykzn3/is_this_normal_opiate_behavior_and_a_sub_related/,8,https://redd.it/aykzn3,TheoreticalCynicist,Is this normal opiate behavior? And a Sub related question.,"So... having used on off for the past few years, actively and majority of time last year, I‚Äôm trying to cut the habit out. However, I‚Äôm finding that I can kick the habit.. physically, fairly simply. As in, I can crank through the physical withdrawals pretty easily ESPECIALLY with less than 1 8mg sub.. I do a 1/3 strip, first day, 1/4 the next, and 1-2mg pieces for the next day (or two). Usually am fine, good to go! 

But this is my question... it seems to be the mental part, the temptation to want to just go get high after a week, 3 weeks, or close to a month being clean (when there is NO physical WD symptoms left), that I‚Äôm having the most difficult time refraining from. 

It‚Äôs as if, this moment comes along.. I‚Äôll be working out, clean, feeling great for days/weeks, then this moment comes where I think about the possibility of getting high. I debate it, but it‚Äôs in that moment that I decide to do so or not to do so. If I decide against it, I won‚Äôt do it. But if temptation overrides, and I consciously decide to do it, I immediately start calculating how long the drive will be to score, how long it will be until taking first hit, etc. in that moment, if I decide to do it, my entire world shifts around the premise of ‚ÄúI am going to get loaded, and how can I weasel my way out of any obligations between now and getting high.‚Äù 

So, is the mental aspect of staying clean suppose to be the most difficult part? Or am I an anomaly? Because for the longest time, that exact routine is what ‚Äúconvinced‚Äù myself that I didn‚Äôt have a problem.. cause I could stop, and be okay, where others couldn‚Äôt even get past the physical aspect of WD. 

‚Äî

Next question is this:

I read everywhere that Sub withdrawals are far worse and longer lasting than opiate... if I were to take only 1-2mg daily for a week or two weeks straight, would I incur those same described Sub WD‚Äôs? Or is that in reference to someone trying to kick them that have been on them (and probably a higher daily dose) for years on end?

I guess, how long of use, and how high of dose of Sub is entering the realm of ‚Äúbad sub WD‚Äôs?‚Äù

Cause honestly, the MINOR sub buzz I can achieve off even 1-2mg (when I have low opiate tolerance) is sometimes just as satisfactory as opiate high... 

Hear me out: it‚Äôs cause, I tend to use opiates for a purpose.. working out, studying longer/waking up earlier, socializing, etc. and the minor buzz achieved from small dose subs, gives me JUST enough of that careless/semi energetic feeling, to where I feel ‚Äúgreat‚Äù not just good.. therefore, am stimulated in social situations, can lift longer in the gym, study with more ease..

Premise to this illustration is, if trying to use subs (in the meantime) instead of using dope, how long can this last at the minimal dose I described before I start trading minor buzz for 3 week long Sub WD?

Thanks guys!",1552011826.0

Today I found out where the open market in my city is. It's fucking 50 meter away from my workplace. I got halg a gram of heroin for 10‚Ç¨, (I very rarely use heroin but common 10‚Ç¨ wtf. The Qualit√§t is about 10-15% raw I heard. But i guess that varies a lot. 

Well I mainly went there to have an oversight about the sketchyness and some benzos. And guess what. Super friendly old people, buying and consuming and just having a good time. About 5-10 regulars and the usual 2 minute buyers. 

Ended up scoring 20x 50mg for 25‚Ç¨ and 10x diazepam 10mg for 10‚Ç¨. All in blisterpacks fresh from the pharmacy. I even sold a 30mg Oxy for 10‚Ç¨ to a young couple and threw an extra 10mg diazepam. I love the prices here. I feel very lucky, and like i said. This place is 50m away from work but still very incognito.

I ended up gifting the heroin to a friend since looked like he was in withdrawl and could need it more than I do.

It‚Äôs amazing, sad, but amazing","Just a quick background. I‚Äôve been a lurker forever but recently made an account and joined the community. Been active for a few weeks maybe. 

I just recently pissed away 7 years of 100% sobriety. Unfortunately, I had to have a couple dental operations done and with that I was subjected to a couple scripts of 7.5s. I genuinely tried to fight thru the pain, but when it became unbearable I broke. I filled them. I took them as prescribed. They ran out, and I was fine. But my brain was triggered. A month past, and a guy I work with was complaining how his doctor fucked his medicine up. So me being me, I ask a few questions. He explained he had been scripted 120/7.5 norco monthly, and his doctor just out of the blue changed his script to 120/2mg hydromorphone. He knew nothing of them. I obviously knew all about them. 

I end up getting a few and snorting them occasionally for a month. Then, as we all know ‚Äúit gets worse never better‚Äù I run into my old ‚Äúmain plug‚Äù for the first time in almost 8 years, and get a rig off him. 

Here I am today, 2 months later, balls deep into an opiate addiction. My plug is completely dry for the very first time since I‚Äôve been back out. I met him on his lunch break about an hour ago. He claims he‚Äôs hurting too, but then the unthinkable happens. He looks at me, and says damn bro I feel bad. I feel responsible for you getting here again(first wd in 7+years) and hands me a 30(press). Man the gratitude and immediate change to my health was unreal.

Anyways, Ive been down this road. And I‚Äôve experienced the light at the end. Today was a realization that it‚Äôs time to change again. It‚Äôs always maybe tomorrow, and that‚Äôs what it will be with me too. I‚Äôll probably go at it a week or so, and then probably a sub maintenance. After having real sobriety for extended length of time, I can truly say, that‚Äôs the best life. 

Hope everyone can become well today. I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôs able to re up on something after he gets off work! If not it‚Äôs going to be long night and rough morning tomorrow!!

I suffer from frequent Kidney Stones and my Doc prescribed me Tramadol to cope with the severe pain they cause me when I pass them.

Good news is that Tramadol knocks the pain down from 10/10 to about a 3 or 4/10 which is an absolute God send.

Bad news is that I am having loads of side effects from the pills. Typically about an hour after taking 50mg - 100mg (dose depending on pain level) my stomach starts to gurgle really loud and I get this really weird feeling. It's hard to describe but the closest I can compare it to is the kind of stomach feeling you have after an adrenaline rush. This tends to stay with me the rest of the day and sometimes into the next morning. What usually accompanies this sensation is a slight dizziness and mild to moderate nausea. I often times also get indigestion and a bloated gassy feeling too which isn't painful but is distracting none the less.

Basically, I don't want to stop the meds because they work wonders for the pain, much better than the Codeine they had me on before, but I can't stand these side effects as they are starting to affect my work. Is there anything I can do to counter these side effects so that I only get the pain relief?

It's been a short while, I been meaning to revisit everyone to greater depth.

My excuse? More work but while I still heavily value sleep and so I prioritize getting a full night's sleep above most things. Beyond that, my workload has lessened and I've had a chance to approach my backlog of things to do. Such as the major water maintenance for my turtle tank yesterday, determining why I got zapped by a filter (I have a a new theory), and securing my tortoise habitat so he doesn't get hurt by jumping out. Eventually I'll make a hinged ramp so my tortoise buddy could come and go safely whenever he wants unless I decide to flip the ramp up. Like the door on a Castle moat. 


&nbsp;


Then there's the telescope thing... that's part of what inspired that last post. You see, I just for some reason imagined a few combinations of a scenario. What if I was still a heroin user? What if I was still falling for Cliff's shenanigans on a weekly basis, as opposed to quarterly. To be fair to myself and my intelligence, the last time I loaned him $40 I was not duped, I did t planning not to get it back but enough excuses here. The point is, even before I stopepd using heroin and oxy, I stopped doing business with Cliff and separated my entanglements with his business. When I realized Derrick had a big mouth and there was no way for me to keep using heroin without shannanigans from both of them, I decided it was a good at ime as any to stop.


Perhaps in other universes this panned out differently. Maybe I stop using dope but still hang out with Cliff every day. Maybe in another universe I don't even smoke weed, or maybe I invented a way to put tar into a wax pen and can be found alkl around town re-charging my vape pen at public places because I'm homeless and use the tar-vape-pen so much that I need to re-charge it fully three times a day. More if I don't get a complete charge!

Now that last one, that just came to mind but I think I want to visit that universe as well sometimes and give readers among the opi family a chance to read it.

The first few ""travelers"" didn't come back, only through a process of trial and error did they stumble across a usable combination of materials and frequencies. Thanks to the neutron-doped transponder rods, it is possible to for a traveler to return to their universe of origin as long as they are one ""hop"" away. After a second hop it is only possible to go to the previous universe, provided that they calibrate their own sensory instruments to the tune of a unique transponder frequency before their last hop.

In universe 226557, which we'll call *557 for short, Sloan is basically the same person he is except that he's still hanging out with Cliff. In fact, he bought his telescope to Cliff's house and Cliff spilled his Pepsi on the Schmidt corrector. As a result of the process of re-alignment, Sloan had to re-calibrate his shit. During the process he mentions to Cliff that he has an $1800 mount on back order, this in turn get's Cliff's mental cog-wheels working. He realizes, ""he has the money.... he has that money!!!! I could finagle something."" Sloan goes home that night and keeps his distance. 


&nbsp;

Four days later, Cliff calls then knocks on Sloan's door at 9:40am. Sloan was up since 4:00 AM dicking around with his telescope and didn't answer his phone when it rang. So Cliff explains, that the nursing home which his mother is staying in wants $750 or they will kick her out. Cliff assures Sloan that he can pay back the loan on the second day of the month when the SSI deposit clears. Being quite reluctant, Sloan wants to buy time to sleep on it but Cliff is kinda just countering everything that is said to that end. Sloan isn't getting more time to think this over and doesn't have it in him to just scream and exclaim his thoughts -- most notably, ""get the fuck out!""


&nbsp;


Sloan says, fuck it.... he said I'll get it back on SSI day. I'll just have to hover over him that day as well. 


What could go wrong?


Cliffs mom dies. [although this happened earlier in our universe] A week later Sloan goes to get his money but Cliff is nowhere to be found. The lights are all off and his doors are locked. Cliff's sister must be up to somethimg else or in collusion, for once. 



Eventually, Cliff explains, ""the SSI didn't clear.""


Then at another point the same weekend he explained, it cleared but I can't take it out on a Sunday because they don't process something on that day, per Cliff.



Then he explains on Monday, ""it cleared but I can't get access to it because my mom's debit card was cancelled and they won't let me touch the money yet.""



**Sloan shares his experience with the opi family on MySpace, in *557 MySpace bulletins are treated with the same respect and importance as Reddit. Reddit is a little experiment by this Emo kid from Brooklyn who went rogue and moved to a nice compound behind satellite internet. As it turns out, releases and updates have slowed down considerably since. Although Reddit slowed down a lot, it is a happier overall scenario than how it panned out in our universe.

Conversely over here, this kid committed suicide in universe numero uno. It was a really sad story, with a conspiratorial twist although mostly based on conjecture. What is known is that the young man was supposedly so depressed after making money that he hung himself. It doesn't add up, but I didn't even have a hint of what true depression was until I experienced opioid withdrawal. The term ""crushing depression"", feels just like that.... one can learn to out-grow it but sometimes it descends like a black canvas with random concrete blocks weighing it down as you walk around under it. I'd imagine that Aaron Russo could have been in such a psychologically claustrophobic state.


&nbsp;


**MySpace Bullettin:**


Sidenote: *Everyone has a cartoon avatar, no real pictures or link to IRL identities on the MySpace opi family. The following are actually alternate universe counterparts for /u/chasingd0pamine , /u/lovepussydrugs , and /u/spinderella69 . They aren't quite like their current universe selves aside from still being friends with my alternate universe self. I especially took creative liberty with the last one.

&nbsp;

Bulletin post text:

It's okay, I think... I get paid in a week and the money will replenish what I loaned. Well, two things... my hours were cut so my paycheck only clears $500 and I'm down $200 after loaning Cliff the $750

&nbsp;

**Responses to MySpace Bulletin:**

running@ft3r_dOpaM3an : You fucking stupid ass. I love you but I told you to stop fucking with that nigga last year. I'd ban you if peopple didn't enjoy learning from your foul-ups.



enjoysvaginasandmedications : What she said. 



SINderella69 : But did he at least offer but sex again to compensate you for the wait?



&nbsp;


End of part one. 

Next time, did Sloan take it in the butt as compensation or will he now that he was reminded of that option?


Is he still going to hang out with Cliff just to be on his case every day about the money? Spoiler alert, yes. That's the point of universe *557. 


&nbsp;

Second spoiler: No, Sloan did not take it in the butt... he only did that one time because of a really awkward bait and switch. Cliff told me he'd get me a freaky goth girl on the condition that she could stick something in my butt. Little did I know it would be a blue-haired merman. Literally, a fish's head and body and legs like a man. Apparently, in Universe *557 they did a bit more in the way of genetic augmentation. There's a number of human-animal chimera. Hell, **Sloan hangs out with a sentient tortoise.** The dude still drinks beer but can only consume it from a funnel and Sloan is a good friend because he helps with that.

I mean, why do all that work to be ok with the world when I could accomplish the same thing in a quick, ten minute morning routine? I was all about that efficiency.

I would flop back down on my bed, sigh deeply, and return to sleepytown.

So my dealer buys from a few different connects. Lately, I think he‚Äôs been going to this one guy a lot because his stuff always breaks down like this. 

Talking about black tar, obviously. 

And I know anybody who has done a lot of black tar has run across stuff like this before Bc I‚Äôve had 3 main connects for BTH. And at one time or another, all 3 of them have had stuff like this before. So it obviously gets around. 

So this is how I would best describe it. Normal BTH dissolves in water fine. I would compare it to black coffee with nothing in it. The color is dark, black. It‚Äôs very, very liquidy. No thickness at all. 

The stuff I‚Äôm talking about I would compare it to coffee with cream/ half n half. It turns a light brown, tan color. And it thickens up just a little bit. I‚Äôve had a batch that made it damn near impossible to suck any of it up into the syringe. This stuff goes into the syringe fine so I‚Äôm getting it all but it makes me wonder what I‚Äôm shooting into my vein. 

This stuff def isn‚Äôt the best but it‚Äôs not horrible. But I would obviously rather have stuff that comes out black and normal. Luckily, my drug dealer is cool af and he asks my opinion on the product so he knows who to re up with. So I can tell him to steer clear of it. 

So I‚Äôm assuming y‚Äôall have seen stuff like this before. Did y‚Äôall like it/dislike it? Any idea why it turns that tan color and thickens up? Any information, experiences welcome. Let me know about everything, please.

Well yesterday i took part of an 8mg sub strip and it didnt totally make me feel better so i ended up smoking(just one little hit) which ended up having little to no effect on me(cause the bupe was already onboard im guessing)... I took that one hit around 12pm yesterday and then ended up taking more of the sub strip around 10pm last night and throughout today....

  


My question is... Do you guys think me taking that one little ass hit reset me back to day 1 of my WD?

Will my withdrawal start to hit me tomorrow?

Or did i do some sort of a taper? Cause to be honest i feel completely fine and had i not taken that little ass hit i would already be through most of the worst of my withdrawal(considering it didnt reset me)...

  


Subs never really did too much for me but i feel perfectly fine considering all ive had in the last ~3 days has been that little ass hit and sub strips.

  


Im hoping i just bypassed the worst of it and flooding my receptors with subs, then. Just a very minimal amount of H(that ended up not doing anything) then subs again was just the right mixture...

  


Oh and so i have opms kratom extract for tomorrow and can get another sub if i need to(friend owes me one)

Not for the squeamish a long orange spike 25gx1'  0.5mmx35mm  being used with 2ml barrel  JJ find !! NSFW https://imgur.com/a/qhAqS8B  though s bit graphic I feel it's apart of harm reduction as if your having to go into your groin then you may need to start thinking of another way of taking your drugs or getting on a methadone script or subutex etc like I've done . As although if done properly/sterile injecting in your groin it's slightly more Risker than injecting any where else complications can include Deep vein thrombosis, blood clots , lung problems , infection , possible leg loss , operation to fix the vein if badly damaged after years of use . Main danger is hitting the artery and splitting the artery wall and bleeding to death internally as a thicker & longer needle is used as scar tissue builds up . Though if your just starting a 1ml should be used and will cause less damage if you accidently pierce the artery . You will experience extream pain if s single unit is pushed into you . Also do not inject cocaine/crack until you are confident you can hit the vein every time !! As the crack may numb the injection site and you inject the entire contents into the artery ! 

TLDR: Me rambling(high as fuck)  on about finding a bag earlier that I lost a few days ago full of valium and didn't know I had lost it . Plus me getting prescribed methadone on the 20th 

  So I scored this morning from a new guy that's basically just at the top of my street . Pretty convenient but the stuff was pretty average . I only do a bag a day and try to stick to this and manage it for the most part .

 I had my dinner but don't eat most of it as I felt a little rough but not full blown WD . So I phoned this guy but he wasn't in bit said he'd be only 20 minutes . So I waited a bit and continued watching The Umbrella Academy I quite enjoy it and my fav character just happens to be the junkie that uses drugs to numb/block out his abilities which is seeing dead people and just saw two seconds ago he can give the ghosts the ability to interact with the living world . 

Anyway I'm going off track about 40 minutes later I go to his place  and his friend is there that I've never met . This guy tells me he has just picked up some new stuff . So he makes me up my bag and the other guys and puts s bit in the foil for us all to try . Me and his mate basically smoke it all and I have to run it for him or my dealer as he's only been taking it for 3 weeks ! Makes me kinda feel bad helping him take it as I've been in this road and been down ALL it's dark roads . I try and tell him to get off this ride while he still can !! Turns out it's his girl friend who got him to try it as apparently they where arguing to much when they where smoking cannabis so some how thought taking heroin would help!!! PMSL they don't have any idea the Pandora's box they are currently opening !!

I Tell him about the insane amount of times I've been in jail (27) which includes alot of remands which they would crazily let me out after 3 weeks remand at one point I was out on 11 bails !!! When I finally did get the jail for TWAC Taking With Out Consent (mother car) the judge ask my lawyer . "" I'm not trying to say Mr ****** is a criminal master mind but how the hell! Is this man still at liberty !! "" To which the court room burst out laughing ! and I got remanded in the end up they completely fucked up my case as I had 12 seperate summery charges which each could have got me 12 months 8 months for pleading early . 

The ""problem"" was thete was just so much paper work the judge couldn't deal with it and he gave me 140 days !!!! PMSL and a 5 year driving ban ! Which I thought was a little excessive !! But I was basically doing cart wheels back down the stairs to the holding cells . My lawyer came straight down to the cells just as ecstatic and told me as long as I managed to get on the bus to the jail which wasn't my local jail but HMP  Barlinnie which is a violent Victorian shit hole but I didn't care !! Plus my co-pilot (cell mate) was fully committed which is a 140 day remand for serious crimes he chased two police officers around with a hand gun didn't tire it or anything but he said they absolutely shit themselves !! And tried to hide under the patrol car ! Lol He got a visit practically everyday from his cousin or GF and they brought up 1/3 bags every time ! A day didn't go by that full sentance we weren't high !! Plus when I got convicted they didn't move me which they should have as your not allowed remand and sentanced in the same cell but because of my short sentance they didn't bother üòÅ 

Anyway at court  I was one of the last ones up so in about 30/40 minutes I was on the bus ! (Thank fuck !!!!)  As happy as Larry !! Plus they back dated the sentance so my remand counted as time served as well !! Hahaha ! 

 Damn I'm high as fuck !! And writting a bloody novel !! I get back to mine and do the bag and this stuff is a bit better and feel great . So I get a treat for the dog and she's a tiny little Lapso Apso only 5 months old and she was the runt and had to be bottle feed si she small even for her breed . So I had chopped up the treat and went up stairs to give her it and dropped a couple of bits besides the bed as I picked it up I noticed a cigarette paper wrapped up in cling film and knee right away it was a bag of heroin !! üòé Last week I got mad with valium and yes I know that it's very dangerous to mix both drugs !! I thought I'd be ok only taking two !! That I got from a friend and didn't get my own batch as if I did that I'd normally get ma with it and end up eating the lot which is normally 16 tablets for a tenner . So I went home which I can remember with two bags I put one away and did the other one . Shortly after I have zero memory woke up the next morning and my mum told me I was absolutely out my nut and filmed me which she showed me . My mum keeps my money so I can budget better and not spend it all at once . I wanted ¬£10 to go into town and get another bag which I didn't really understand until tonight but mystery solved!! Wish I had found it an hour before I got another bag but hey what ever. It's been s good night ! Plus I'm quite enjoying The Umbrella Academy . 

  Oh I almost forgot I had my referral today at my local Health centre/GP which was pretty handy and didn't have to travel to the local hospital /mental health facility which would have been a pain to get to as I'd need to get two buses and would most likely cost over ten pounds to get there and back so they came to me and was only a  5 minute walk . There was two of them one I think was in training as she was quite young and a woman in her early 30s . Since I've been on methadone before they didn't really need to explain much and they where still giving out the same booklets they where 10 plus years ago . I just went over my drug history when I started what drugs I was currently taking and what I wanted out the program which is basically stability and to get some money behind me and get my house decorated and get cooking facilities that I don't have at the moment . As just now every penny goes on heroin . So I have no disposable income . Plus the council is unwilling to help . A few weeks ago I got notified ""someone"" my old bat of a neighbour who I fucking cut her grass for her !! Lifted the phone and told the council I wasn't living in the house . I really don't get why someone would try and grass someone in off their own back !! But it kinda back fired as I was upfront and told the guy who came out to the house the truth that I wasn't staying there full time as I had no cooking facilities and not even a fridge or microwave at the time (got both now) and he understood and referred to to a couple of organisations that are going to help me . Though I just got word I got rejected by the council again . But I'm going to appeal it . 

   When I applied for a council house I had no idea that I'd get offered a house if 4 WEEKS !!!  First place they offered might have well been in Syria !! First it was 30 miles from where I grew up or know any one !! Plus the flats looked like they had been built by communist Russians !! Lol a horrible concrete grey area of the town and a 5 minute Google search of it told me to avoid it like the plage .

About  2 weeks later I got another offer in my town in a really rough area filled with drug dealers ,muggings ,assaults and a few stabbings and slashings . Plus it was a poxy bedsit basically what you guys call a studio flat I think a largish one room property living room and kitchen combined with a broom closet for a bedroom . I even knew the guy that last stayed in it and had been in it a few times so that was a no !! .

 Next place was only a mile and a half away from me in the next village over a nice little bungalow üòÅ it was just about perfect in a good quiet area though even further from town . But the bungalow was just recently out fitted for a disabled person !! Like all brand new stuff almost all the banisters, a slight run way into the front door, a new wet room etc . Why the hell they where offering it to me I had no idea as apart from addiction I'm perfectly healthy and able bodied . So out of respect I turned it down and this time went in to their offices myself and asked them what they where playing at !!?? The woman looked/treated me like I was crazy at first and couldn't understand why I was turning down a good property but soon realised my objections and I made them promise/try to give it to someone that actually reality needed it !! My friend lives just a hundred or so meters  away and has told me someone in s wheel chair moved in . I also didn't want to move there as there's a bit of bad blood as my brother killed someone in that village by total accident (crash) and his wife just won't let it go !! Plus he got screwed over at court/police he shouldn't have even been charged as it was a complete accident . My Auntie works for the Met down in England and she has reduced duties due to her back and it's basically her job to decide if there's enough evidence or its in the public's interest to charge someone and she said if it came across her desk he wouldn't have been charged with what he was charged with . The police didn't even interview him FFS !!! Months later he just got a letter through the door he was being charged and would need to get a lawyer and go to court . 

The guy that got killed had a son in the local police and I think some of the family had some well to do folk in local government as well . So he was rail roaded they tried to say he was a bit racer etc even though he was going the speed limit and made a simple over taking mistake . Plus he had the car two days and it was proven the back end was faulty and it wasn't properly checked they are ment to do like a 100 odd point check but this wasn't done . Plus on the guys small van you could turn off the driver airbags for some insane reason and he did this for some reason !! And it was the steering column that killed him by crushing his chest. 

All this and other things where completely ignored plus the cop son some how managed to sneak into court even though he knew he wasn't allowed into court . I wasn't allowed to go as I can some times have a mouth on me and I'm no stranger to courts and have no problem speaking my mind I've had to defend myself a couple of times when my lawyer or underling  has failed to turn up . I've told the judge to go fuck themselves etc a couple if times . One judge I knew have me  two weeks in  prison just to be a cunt as he knew me and this was at the district court where NO ONE GETE THE JAIL ! Or very rarely !  So I started giving him abuse so I was in contempt of court . Plus I used to work for the fucking stuck up cunt !! As he owned a restaurant which was very posh and expensive though the food was 5 üåü and I learned alot ! As everything was made from scratch ! And there was a shit tonne of prep work . I was at college training to be a chef at the time (16 years old)  so I was basically the KP kitchen porter/bus boy and every other kitchen position when needed valuable training yes but of course this was abused !! But me being me I didn't put up with that shit ! Kinda got on trouble but the head chef understood where I was coming from and they treated me a bit different from my friend who got me the job there and was also in my class . He was a really mellow dude and constantly smoke hash !! He had a joint in his mouth when ever he could !! . 

  When you worked there you got absolutely nothing to eat !! And got in serious trouble if you did ! Plus that arsehole would come in every so often and try and lord it up all over us . Normally banging on about his stupid rules etc Never worked in a kitchen like it ! Food and the odd coca cola or even a sneeky beer or alchopop which is easier to hide are normally a perk of the job as long as your not taking the piss and making yourself fillet steak every day once a week maybe !! Lol In other places if the bar staff etc  ordered something I'd go out my way to give them extra as they where still paying a bit of money to it . I'd make awesome huge burgers or if they orders a cheap steak I'd give them s better one or make them a huge mixed grill etc . They in return would do you drinks when you wanted them and not the concentrated orange juice or blackcurrant you were supposed to get . Though a Smirnoff ice and blackcurrant was one of my favs !! The amount of alchoholic chefs is quite surprising !! And drinking at work was very common or drug taking . 

  End up my brother got 6 fucking years !!! Bit he appealed it and he got 4 years but they kept it over 3yrs 8 months so he wouldn't get half remission and become licence when he got out . He got to an open prison pretty fast though and did 3 weeks in one week out . But the idiot got caught with a soda can pie and tiny bit if legal high and got sent back to normal  jail but managed to get back to an open after a few months of keeping his nose clean . 

   My bro is really into his football and likes to go to the Rangers home matches when they are on . There's a club bus that departs from that village and is organised from there and that fucking cow found out and got him fucking batted from the bus !!! She wrote a letter to the chairman and they got another couple of anon letters about him and they asked him not to come back !! THIS REALLY PISSED ME OFF !! If it where up to me I would have done something in retaliation yes it's petty and most likely criminal but I would have felt better about it . But I need to respect my bros wishes so I didn't do anything. Also not that money matters and certainly can't bring back a lived one  but the guy was also insured up to the max and she got ALOT of money from the accident and I mean serious üí∞üí∞üí∞ she also places flowers at the crash site constantly !! And it's been nearly 10 years !! Fresh ones are there all year round and we travel this road most days . I know it sounds really bad but come to fuck !! How long are you going to greave for until you start moving on !! If anything it's just not healthy !! The fields where it happened are up for sale so I think she has been told to stop putting them there as it'll obviously affect potential customers . The small streach of road is an accident black spot and people crash there ALL THE TIME . When my bro crashed about a week and a half later they resurfaced the road and put down road markings not to over take . Something that wasn't there when my bro crashed but they said was there when he did crash that was a complete lie !! You could have easily have used Google maps to disprove this deception but I'm not even sure his lawyers did . Like I said the whole court case was a sham !! When he got found guilty/sentenced the wife had an out hurts of ""We did it"" that when I heard if this I found highly suspicious !!! DID WHAT ?? They should have had no hand in court proceedings !! 

  Anyway that's all in the past and my bro has moved on well apart from the recent football bus petty shit !! I'm just looking forward to the 20th and I can get my script !! Apparently I'll get it that day and they now set up the chemist for you as back in the day you had to find one yourself and had to go from chemist to chemist with the actual script and try and get into one relatively close to where you lived . I just have to repeat what I said to the nurses and give a piss test probably to prove you have opiates in your system had have some what of a tolerance and your not going to get 30 ml and OD an hour or so later ! You used to have to go to the hospital in withdrawal and they would give you 10ml and hour or so and see what amount stabilised you and constantly take your vitals but they don't do it that way any more thankfully we it could take hours . Now it just a quick chat tell you what's expected of you like turning up to appointments , if you want a weekly worker and apparently there are workers now that actually have experience !!! And have either been clean for years or are on a maintance program . I think this is a brilliant idea !! As being told some bullshit about addiction from some drug worker in their early 20s that's never even had a cigarette in their mouth used to annoy me to no end !!!  Like the nurse today telling me how all the heroin going about just now is crap ! I'm like how do you know that ?? Have you tried loads of different bags from local dealers ? Her:umm no obviously not . Me: Ao you've had lots of recent batches tested or got information from police raids on confiscated heroin ? Her: ehhh no. So why say something like that if you don't actually know ?? She then quickly change the subject !! 

  Hope everyone is doing well and your not in WD through lack of funds or much  worse you can't score any where !! All  best from bonnie Scotland !!

I have forgiven them and check up with them every once in a while. 

I go meet up with them every once in a while and the itching and small pupils give it away when this person has relapsed. Sometimes they tell me they're clean other times they tell me they've struggled in the past and had a relapse but never when the relapse happens. The conversations are short and I just listen and tell them that relapse is normal. This person does not go into detail about their substance use so I try to respect that. I know a lot more about their past substance use through others than they think I do but I never bring it up. 

I understand why they would not go into detail or bring it up and I dont want to pry. I dont want to judge or stigmatize this person or even tell them to stop using if they are. I just want to have a conversation about naloxone, clean needles, not using alone and make sure that they're using harm reduction services. Should I bring up this conversation with them? I dont want this person to think I'm judging them especially because theres a lot of stigma, history between us and they only briefly mention relapse after they're clean again.

He often, but not always, uses any day he can afford to, and when he does, it's multiple times per day. I even used to sell him acetyl- and butyl-fentanyl, and his purchase pattern was the familiar one we all know well.

*However*, he says that when he can't score D, he gets at the absolute most extremely mild WD symptoms, a bit of a runny nose and some yawning. And in the time that I've known him, used with him, sold to and bought from him, he has never been visibly sick.

I've tried to Google it and also run searches through academic journals, but I've not found anything about immunity to opioid withdrawals.  

Any of you experience this personally or know someone with a similar claim? He does go through alcohol withdrawals when he drinks like that, so it's just like that with opies. It is the kind of flex that someone might make up, but I really doubt it with this guy. He knows that a lie like that is a great way to not get help if you're legit sick.

I've told him that if it's true, he needs to put his body and brain into the hands of science when he dies. At the very least, it would be extremely interesting, but it could likely also pave the way for novel, highly effective treatments for recovery/detox and rewrite the book on the neurology/physiology of opioid addiction.

I'm not super into heroin anymore anyway, even though I've been doing it all day every day for over a year. Mostly because it doesn't make me feel high anymore, just normal. I've heard people that have been addicts for 5+ years have this problem along with a huge tolerance but I don't even have a tolerance like that. 15mg of oxy still puts me on my ass, but doesn't make me feel high. Just dopey. So the fact that my once favorite euphoric as hell drug ever, no longer does anything for me, is pretty depressing. Blessing in disguise? Bah. 

Anyway...

My question is, when I stop taking these other opioids, will I withdraw as bad as I would if I had stopped while taking only heroin? 

I've heard people switch to methadone to then quit more easily, same thing with Kratom. So if I'm not actually doing heroin, am I just postponing my sickness or am I really getting clean and on the right track? I'm worried I'm just replacing one addiction with another.

&#x200B;

I started using a couple years ago, I smoked H on and off for a while (an average of twice a month). When I felt distressed, up to twice a week. I never became a heavy user (well, not yet), and I have not smoked since December. I maintained a very average life, getting C's at University, working a minimum wage job etc. Most people I know, including many cokeheads (along with some ketheads and the odd crack user), alienated me once they found out. Maybe I shouldn't blame them (not sure I do) but my heroin use didn't affect anyone. The experience blew my mind, more than smoking heroin did. I study Human Geography and I have decided to undertake a dissertation that focuses on the stigmatisation of heroin. I will be looking into various outbreaks, treatment programs etc. Where I live, there is an extremely strong correlation assumed between poverty and heroin use (not in the sense that heroin makes you poor but in the sense that only the poor, in every sense of the word, will consider taking heroin). I want to investigate this narrative in depth. It would be great to hear your thoughts, but I am not necessarily looking for a specific explanation in response to a specific question. I would love to hear absolutely any experience or thoughts you have personally had, it terms of being ousted from society. My study will have a spatial element so any thoughts on how you experience certain space. Spaces you feel excluded by versus spaces, or moments, where you feel secure. This can also be discussed in terms of actually being high. Absolutely anything you can think of.

&#x200B;

I want to remind everyone: I am not trying to romanticise heroin or advocate its use. I am also not, in the slightest, trying to claim that I am immune to addiction, who knows what will happen in the future. I simply want to learn about people's experience of either, being alienated or alienating themselves. I just want to hear your feelings.

As the title says I was getting clean. After days of essentially having the flu and wanting to die I said fuck it I‚Äôll got to the movies tomorrow by myself. What I didn‚Äôt expect was I was at the really sensitive and easy to cry part of the quitting process. Idk if it‚Äôs like this for many other theatres but out the one right near me you get really comfy lounge type seats where u push a button and a guy comes to take your order. They have a lot of good meals on their menu which is great. 

Trailers start. I see the trailer for ‚Äúdogs journey‚Äù I think it was called. Cried during that. I was really quiet and there were barely any people so no one could ever tell. Towards the end of the movie I was emotional again. When it was over and I headed out to my car it was snowing beautifully. I didn‚Äôt even know it was supposed to snow. Driving back was so beautiful and coupling that with me thinking back on the movie and here come the emotions. 

The thing about that whole experience was that it actually felt amazing. As someone who has been emotionally blunted for a long time it was so foreign to me when I actually got emotional. It felt great to actually get some tears out. Tbh I wish I could play that all out again. What‚Äôs the reason for writing all this nonsense that no one cares about? This was a really nice experience that I only got when I decided to quit using opioids. If this little story helps even just one person to think about quitting then I‚Äôll have done my duty.

If so how did it start and when? How do you feel opiates have changed your high school life as opposed to the rest of the kids in your school? 

I‚Äôll start. I sold a lot of weed sophomore year. I started selling a lotta coke junior year (and doing a lot too lol). But in the middle of my junior year I started sellin dope, mostly to older people cuz nobody my age did it. But of course I started to it but I thought it was okay because I had money. I got addicted late junior year. But I feel opiates took a lot from how high school was supposed to be for me. I would miss school a lot or dismiss myself from school because I was sick. I would skip lunch and sit in the bathroom sometimes because I didn‚Äôt wanna eat or was depressed from being dopesick. I didn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúschool spirit‚Äù compared to all of my friends, and I even remember skipping big pep rallies and assemblies to leave school early without getting caught to get well. Needless to say my grades suffered and so did my attendance. I feel if I wasn‚Äôt on opiates, or at least didn‚Äôt get physically addicted to them, I would‚Äôve had a much better high school career with better memories. It affected a lot of my friendships in school too. 

In my school we would have a week of shop or vocations and then a week of academics. There was 12 of us in shop. Only 1-2 of kids in my shop knew what I was sniffing all the time in school because they were close to me. But others started to get suspicious and think it wasn‚Äôt coke that I was sniffing in shop because I‚Äôd fall asleep right after lol and I‚Äôm positive my shop teacher knew I was an addict, yet for some reason he chose me out of everyone in the shop to work for his company after we graduated. Anyway I‚Äôm rambling here. I guess what I wanna say is that being addicted to opiates took a lot of my teen and high school life from me. High school should be fun for kids. Nobody that age should be at school worrying about being dopesick. If I could go back and do it all over again, I would. But I can‚Äôt take back what I‚Äôve done and I‚Äôve gotta try to do right for right now and the future and let the past be the past. Let me know your experiences with opiates and high school below.

I‚Äôve been on suboxone for about a year now. I researched Tia and decided to give it a go. Ordered 15 grams of the sodium and did all 15g over a 5 day span.  The high was great but nothing to write home about.  Waited about 28 hours after my last sub to dose the tia. Felt great for the first 2 days but just felt like I was getting well for the remaining 3 days. I think coming off the subs affected the outcome of it. 

After those 5 days I waited 24 hours to go back on the suboxone to prevent and pwds that may occur even though tia is a TCA, it still an agonist on the Mu receptors. 

Dosed 2mg of Subs to be safe and after an hour I didn‚Äôt get any adverse effects so I continued to dose my normal 8mg. I still got no relief from withdrawals so I did another 8mg. Still nothing...
I ended up doing a total of 32mg of buprenorphine to try and saturate my receptors and it still barely touched the WDs.  Was able to sleep last night but not comfortably. 

I‚Äôm closer to 48 hours without tia now and still get hold/cold sweats and mild WDs even on suboxone.  Just stick to normal drugs if you can kiddos and take my word for it that Tianeptine ain‚Äôt worth it.

https://i.redd.it/ood46ec7wik21.jpg

Long story, short.. I began using and abusing hydrocodone off and on around 2008/2009. I‚Äôve also been around the block more than I can count with morphine sulfate, oxymorphone (OPANA, mmmm‚Ä¶), hydromorphone, fentanyl, etc. Around the time my mother became terminally with cancer in mid-2012, I began using #4 heroin (insufflated only) and A LOT of it. A best friend ‚Äúgifted‚Äù me with around $1.2M cash after she passed away (\*an entirely other story, in and of itself!\*) and things began to get out of hand. With the help of my wife, who I met while trying to self detox in the summer of July 2013 and with the help of Suboxone, I eventually got clean (other than Kratom) in late 2017. However, also in late 2017; my health problems came to a crescendo and I essentially was diagnosed with spondylosis arthritis in my neck, three extruding discs (one in my neck, other two in lower back), scoliosis of the spine, degenerative disc disease and also.. Cubital, Guyon‚Äôs and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in both hands/wrists. My PCP started treating me with steroids and tramadol. The pain was so intense and persistent, he eventually had me taking 10mg of hydrocodone, x4 day. 

&#x200B;

Eventually it was obvious my pain levels and quality of life was so unmanageable, he referred me to a pain management doctor. He‚Äôs been a WONDERFULLY attentive and empathic physician so far. He started me off with Percocet, 10mg, x4 day. The APAP was horrible on my stomach and liver, so he eventually switched me to Oxycodone, 10mg, x4 day. It helped a bit, but not quite enough to get me through a full work day on my feet. So, as of today, I‚Äôm prescribed Oxycodone, 15mg, x3 day.. however, I usually take x4 day and take the weekend off. During my last visit this past Monday, he offered to also write my a script for medical marijuana; because of the synergy between the two, many patients end up having to take less of the opiates.

&#x200B;

My wife is understandably wary, but I have a daily pill container and a chart to keep track of my usage and allow her to count the pills at the end of each day. I admittedly will usually take 1.5 orally and insufflate the other 1.5 - but it usually just depends on whether I need help with ‚Äúbreak through pain‚Äù or longer lasting relief. Sorry to ramble.. but I always see other people posting pics of their stash and after receiving my script for the month this morning, I became elated and wanted to share - it does indeed feel like my birthday! ..although it technically falls on the 19th. Cheers to all my fellow Pisces, March Birthday‚Äôers, chronic pain suffers and opiate aficionados. Good day, everyone! ",1551888704.0

This week I've been recovering from tramadol W/Ds because I feel like a cunt and would like to start doing sex something opiates have never made me keen on and if I see her again or any chick again I'd like to fuck them somewhat adequately. 

I'm 24 so this is giving me anxiety because everyone knows about it but they don't know it was my first time and they've all been fucking since like 16 (my circle of friends and there GFs friends etc) but my first go went south pretty quickly (if I hadn't of busted 2 weeks of nut in her raw I'd of gone south too return the favour but yeah nah)

I'm on day 4 of quitting tram after a month of constant (400mg) dosages daily and a few kpins have helped today but last 3 days were so sad and scary.

Anyway does anyone think if I take some Cialis this weekend (I got a decent member but my boners are like a third of what they are capable of), have a FEW drinks then pop 150mg tramadol (I heard it makes you last longer) and wear a rubber I might have a shot at redemption?

I was addicted to OxyContin and Codeine heavily as a teen (Use both at most once a month as a treat now I'm older) but only started doing tramadol this year because I got a bunch dumped on me super cheap leading to abuse for several weeks .

Anyway if anyone has any advice on how I can not cum so early (which happens usually as I'm not accustomed to sex) I'd really appreciate it. 

I lurk here a lot otherwise I'd go to r/sex but idk if they would understand me as well.

TL;DR will Tramadol 150mg max w/ Cialis and a thick rubber help me fuck adequately?

It‚Äôs all about getting sweaty‚Ä¶,"A huge topic around here is how to get through withdrawal, both acute and post acute varieties. Having gone through my own ct wd not that long ago and still being slightly sketchy, this is a subject of huge interest to me. Plus I am a bit of a science nerd so I like this stuff.

There have been a multiplicity of recommendations regarding the best way to hack your withdrawal. Supplements, comfort drugs, and so forth. But the one method to rule them all is exercise. Probably something like 90% of people here recommend it.

I am all about sweating. It has been a huge help to me and improves my shitty mood, especially in the morning. But what if there was a way to speed up your withdrawal and not even have to go out in the cold to run?

Saunas have been around for a long time. They generate intense heat, which allows you to sweat without having to run anywhere.

These days, people like to study and will study virtually anything. One studious person is Dr. Rhonda Patrick, Phd. She is a researcher, public speaker and pretty damn good looking too.

She has a bs in biochem and her doctorate is in biomedical science. So not a lightweight.

It turns out that a 20 minute sauna bath can raise endorphin levels in your brain, plus do many other amazing things like:

Helps grow new brain cells.

Helps your brain function faster.

Improves memory, attention and focus.

My take, if you just too freakin sick to run anywhere, find a sauna. You will feel at least a little better, and maybe a lot better.

I‚Äôm fucking scared.,"Sorry for getting all up in your guys‚Äô corner of the world. I‚Äôve never posted cause I want you all to have a safe spot. Just don‚Äôt know where else to run. Had to call 911 tonight. First time I‚Äôve ever done that. First time I‚Äôve ever seen a person‚Äôs face that color. I thought I lost him, I really did. I looked back at my phone log and I was shocked to see the 911 call was only 3 minutes. It felt like a lifetime. 

Idk, in some way I feel like I really fucked up. Maybe I should have given him more time to get out of the nod. By time the cops came knocking on the bathroom door he was semi-alert again to the point that he was eventually able to get himself out of the bathroom to get his vitals taken. They didn‚Äôt narcan him and let him sign AMA and not get checked out at the hospital. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have gotten outside parties involved. I didn‚Äôt even think about cops coming. He‚Äôs never gonna forgive me for this when he finally sobers up tomorrow and realizes the jeopardy we may potentially be in. But I‚Äôve never seen anyone turn that color before. It will haunt me for life.

Paramedics even pointed out that all our neighbors were outside staring. Our landlord lives just a couple apartments over. I had just had a discussion with her hours before about us needing to sign a new lease. I fear now we may get evicted. I am beginning to regret all this. But I will never be able to unsee his face. 

I‚Äôm not gonna lecture anyone, I know it‚Äôs not easy and no one really asks for or wants this life. But if there‚Äôs anything I can say, is that there‚Äôs gotta be at least one person in your life that wants you to stick around. Even if it‚Äôs a fellow bropiate. People care. People don‚Äôt want to ever see you turn that color. 

if you think you‚Äôve overcome your addiction and that‚Äôs in your past, with all due respect don‚Äôt get too full of yourself. he was sober over 2 years other than methadone. he tapered from 100mg down to 11 over the course of the last 2 years. it just got too hard and he reached his breaking point. and i let him. i fucking let him. at worst i thought he was relapsing. it never even occurred to me that i would see his face then that color. 

usually i‚Äôm emotional and screaming and crying, but I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve shed a single tear through this whole ordeal tonight. I feel numb and sick and regretful. I feel angry and confused and anxious. The negative feelings will hopefully go away with time. But I  never forget the color his face turned tonight. 
  
stay safe. i love you. 

edit: thanks for the kind words. sorry for invading your guys‚Äô safe space. i‚Äôve been lurking here for years but i never comment cause i don‚Äôt want to be the ‚Äòoutsider‚Äô making anyone uncomfortable or feeling judged. 

hopefully he‚Äôs out of the woods. he‚Äôs been up on and off, he‚Äôs apologized a million times and said this is the wake up call he needed. he goes to the clinic on thursday to get his bottles so he‚Äôs going to try to go up a bit until he gets acclimated. i think we were both so excited and hopeful that he was getting so close to getting off methadone, he pushed himself too hard. 

im grateful he‚Äôs alive. i‚Äôm grateful to be alive. im grateful that everyone reading this is alive. my inbox is always open if anyone ever needs an open ear. thanks again all for allowing me to get this out. no one in my life (other than his family) knows about his addiction so it‚Äôs really lonely and scary sometimes. 

double edit: i sincerely can‚Äôt thank you all enough for your kind replies. thanks so much for making me feel just as safe as i want all you to feel. take care out there, because there are strangers like me that care about you all! thanks again for letting me ramble away and not putting me down like other subs might :) ",1551853194.0

I've been shooting for probably 4 of those years. It's been 2 and a half years since I did the 38 days in jail, so I've been daily since then. I have a 2 year prison sentence on the shelf while on probation for the 2 years as long as I don't fuck up. It's going to be at least 2 or 3 months until I'm sentenced probably and start the probation. The heroin that I get around here isn't actually heroin and I suspect it's not even really fentanyl to be honest. People say they have gone 5+ days in rehab and done subs and still gone through precip with the stuff around here. So I'm wondering if anyone has experience going to hydros from heroin and coming off that. 

Also, going from hydros to sub, how long of a wait? I'm reading as little as 6 hours, I would wait at least 24+ hours just wondering if anyone has experience.

Ideally I would like to start snorting the H(whatever it is), go to pills and taper off that. Eating the pills not snorting. Although whether I can get 5s or 10s is a hard question and how much it would cost. If I went to pills, then to subs, how hard would that taper be?

I'm new, so please feel free to crucify my ass if I missed something in the rules/common threads that I should have referred to.

My tolerance is insane. It's been this way since 6 months after my first heroin use. I don't remember if my doses of other opiates (hydromorph, oxycontin, oxycodone) were higher than others. I have never overdosed (no ego shit) despite using much more of the same dope than others (with similar use patterns) who overdosed.

I'm on methadone- 80mg. I was stable on 55mg but had to go up again a few times because I used (no more than 2 days of use) and my methadone wouldn't work properly. So up I'd go just to almost-stabilize. 80mg and clonidine kept withdrawal about 95% at bay- and then I used again. This time for 3 days. And wow. Even with my methadone, I have cold sweats, anxiety, yawning and sniffles, achiness. So then it becomes hard to get through that for ~4 days to the other side. So I use, and back to square one again.

Not one substitute user I know relates to this experience (shit-cycle?) when I ask about it. My doctor gives me absolutely no answer as to whether this is normal.

TLDR: My tolerance seems to have absolutely no fucking ceiling, my methadone doesn't work after I use (even briefly) and I can use an ignorant amount of heavy dope without getting a rush, let alone ODing.

(I'm not trying to get banned from my favorite sub. Just want to help promote safe drug use and awareness to those who may not know about the benefits or are too nervous to try a consumption room.)

I've been using for 7 years, 2 of those I have been using a consumption room often . It has so many great benefits and it's nice to be in a non judgmental environment around other addicts. It also helps users get the support and information they might need for rehab, homeless shelters, school, and work. Believe it or not, you can test your drugs for free , endless syringes and drug supplies, and free food. Need a nap or to get out of the cold... They'll give you a mat to nap on and at least 2 hours to rest if staffing is available. The staff are nurses and alike and they have had zero 0000 overdoses since opening. 

It is located across the street from the police station and people use in front of the building if the rooms are not available or there is a wait. There is an agreement that the police can't arrest anyone within 2 city blocks for possession or use UNLESS they are dealing or are a threat to the community... And of course, doing something illegal other than drugs. So feel free to hit your crap pipe in from of 5-0, cus they don't give a shit.... Alright alright I digress, got to keep it relevant and appropriate. 

These 2 consumption rooms were created for users and the community. The reason for users is listed above, but the community was upset at the image some drug users were giving the city. Syringes laying around on the sidewalks, people sleeping in apartment stair wells, and people using out in the open. What really sparked this idea and set things into motion, was a homeless drug user had nodded out in an apartment complex stair well and was set on fire by  teenagers. He lived

I really want to inform people about consumption rooms and hope that they begin to grow in popularity. They really are great and I can see how much they have benefited everyone in the community. 

Feel free to ask me anything, but please keep it appropriate. No sourcing or anything that will help this post get deleted. ",1551822873.0

I dropped him off on Friday, still having doubts about whether he could handle it (he's run away before, and I've had to go looking for him for days at a time, usually finding him curled up in an abandoned basement or truck, too ashamed to come home and face me). I got a phone call today from the detox center and, fearing the worst, answered it with a shaky hello. You have no idea the pride and gratitude I felt when I heard his voice on the other end. He's got a few more days of detox left, and then two weeks of inpatient, followed by two months of intensive outpatient. He's on the suboxone treatment, he says, and it's helping him feel like a normal human being again. I can't help but sob heavily, I truly believe he wants to get clean for good this time. I know we're not out of the woods yet, and in fact won't be for a while, but I am a man of God and so is he, and I believe that God is working in us right now. I just have a couple of questions for you fine folks over here, as a person who has never done anything stronger than an annual line of coke:

What can I expect from him when he gets out of inpatient, i.e. What kind of withdrawal symptoms will he still be experiencing, and what red flags do I need to watch out for that indicate he's sliding again? 

Perhaps more importantly, what can I do to support him when he comes home? I don't want to smother him and make him feel like I'm breathing down his neck 24/7, but I want to be there for him in every way possible.

Let me know if you guys have any questions so I can clarify the situation. I love him a lot and I just want him to lead a happy, healthy life, hopefully with me. ",1551773597.0

Your ridiculous superpowers.,"There is a lot of talk nowadays about neuroplasticity, how your brain can adapt to new challenges. This is vital for us addicts, because we spend a lot of time cooking our brains with nuclear option chemicals of insane potency.

Yup, that's right. Jack that speedball. Not like you are doing any damage or anything. Break on through to the other side.

Why am I talking about this?

Well, it turns out that your brain is amazing. In spite of the the ethical equivalent of child abuse that we put our brains through, they seem to have an amazing ability to morph themselves into something new. 

There was a kid that had a tumor in his brain. He was having seizures almost everyday. So doctors cut out a huge chunk of his right brain. There were fears that, of course, he would now become a drooling trainwreck of a kid and be disabled for life.

But it turns out that he is fine. The left side of his brain took over and rewired everything. Now he plays chess, goes to school and does normal kid stuff.

I am right handed. But I had an experience where I took some damage and was forced to start using my left hand. Now I am sort of ambidextrous. It is very strange.

So if you are like me and think maybe you fucked up your brain beyond all recognition, and there is nothing left for you but doom and gloom, maybe not. It may take some time and hard work, but maybe you can fix it.

I am going to sound like a terrible person and get a lot of hate. But, I DID NOT PLAN ON THIS! Found out I was pregnant in Dec. (was on BC, IT FAILED!) Dependent on Subutex, gabapentin and xanax (all legally prescribed) at the time. The DAY I found out I checked into the hospital for detox from everything. That didn't happen!
 Left me on Subutex, reduced but didnt DC my gabapentin, but did take me off the xanax. I was under the impression when they released me they would finish tapering at least the gabapentin but here I am months later and still on 300 mg 3xday. I've tried EVERYTHING I know to do to help enough with the withdrawal to quit and just cant get below that. Ive BEGGED to be put back in the hospital for them to taper the rest and they refuse. NOT  because it could be dangerous for the baby or even me, technically, but my doctor is afraid my pain will be too bad and I will relapse. I have SEVERE chronic pain and nerve damage from a car accident that broke my back in 2 places. He also worries about my mental state because I also have severe PTSD from an event I'd prefer not discussing. I keep saying, At least give me a chance! He said NOT to cold turkey, that could be dangerous but tapering as long as I can handle it will be fine. I have to take a drug test every week but honestly it would be VERY easy to sneak in clean if need be. I wont get into all of it bc this is already long but basically I would have a 4 week window to either use something else and either get it outta my system or I can check back into the hospital if I go a  route which I'll get into here... I still have PLENTY of xanax from years of saving up. I know for a fact the xanax will not hurt the baby or cause NAS as long as I only take it that 4 weeks and they will readmit me to taper me off of it in the end. (Yes, they will admit me for xanax but NOT gabapentin.) I feel like I am backed into a corner! I have a friend in the same program and her son was born on gabapentin and subutex. They detoxed her son from subutex in around 2 weeks and it was a breeze but she said the gabapentin is Hell. I DON'T WANT THAT FOR MY SON! If I could just stop it all this second I would but the doctors have scared me about stopping too much in fear of miscarriage. Also, if I am only on Subutex I can breastfeed, both I cant. I just want him to go through as little as possible. I feel so guilty! This is NOT what I planned! I also have read CBD oil will help but again I have 4 weeks before I have a blood test I cant fake so I gotta do whatever I am gonna do in that amount of time. (If it's just THC in my system they wont readmit but give me a warning and levels will have to start decreasing.) I just DONT want to go back on xanax if it wont help the gabapentin withdrawal. That's not solving anything. Same with CBD. I've tried magnesium but to no avail. Kratom was suggested but I am too leery of the side effects since it's unregulated and unlike CBD doesnt even have test results and can cause it's own withdrawal and I cant be admitted for that either. I know plenty of people that smoked pot while pregnant and their babies are perfect and even my own doctor admitted it wasnt too harmful, just illegal. (I dont plan on using pot, just CBD but just saying.) I've tried broad spectrum and it didn't help at all. Used full spectrum a couple of days before I realized it could end up showing on a test and it helped some but not enough. I am sorry for the long post, I am just so upset, ashamed, scared, and frustrated. 

Long question short, how much will xanax and CBD oil help with gabapentin withdrawal and are there any other natural things that would be safe? I also have cyclobenzaprine, clonodine, vistiril, and reglan all approved from doctor and I believe he has said topomax is safe but Id have to double check.

axeouy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/axeouy/panda_iv_prep/,3,https://redd.it/axeouy,Retrograde-Amnesiac,Panda IV Prep.,"Is the preparation for IV'ing crushable and non-crushable pandas not well known here? I only ask because I keep seeing people mention that they're only good for oral/nasal administration and that's absolutely not true. I've been a regular IV user of (almost solely) oxymorphone for going on 8 years with no known ""blood disorders"" and it would be surprising if this community didn't know the tricks.

Edit: for clarification, I'm referring only to the crushable IR and generic ER versions. The name brand ""plastic"" ER pills can cause endocarditis more easily than other injectable pills, but they can be shot. Prep is relatively easy and quick, actually.

Also, I'd be more than happy to explain the process for those interested - just let me know.

axe2hi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/axe2hi/having_surgery_while_on_suboxone/,0,https://redd.it/axe2hi,bluewithnoblues,Having surgery while on Suboxone,"Hi,

I've been a long time lurker (this is a throw away account) and I've been off blues and on Suboxone since the first of the year. This subreddit has helped me so much! I got to the point where the real pharma 30's did nothing for me, even if I took 10 throughout the day, and I was taking around 5 presses a day and having to track them down every other day and I was just miserable. 

&#x200B;

I'm taking 8mg of Suboxone daily and no one in my life knows (that I'm aware of) that I'm an addict besides my dealers and my Suboxone doctor, not even my husband. I need to have a myomectomy next month and I'm afraid to tell my gynecologist that I'm on Suboxone. I talked to my Suboxone doctor and he said that if I don't want to tell her I should just tell the anesthesiologist right before they put me under. He said if I don't want to admit to being an addict that I can say I take it for Fibromyalgia. I feel like if i tell the anesthesiologist I might as well just woman up and tell my gynecologist. won't both doctors talk to each other? I think my real fear is that if I tell them, it will come up several times during my stay at the hospital and my family might find out. 

&#x200B;

Is my pain med tolerance going to be through the roof? This surgery is pretty routine but they will be cutting my lower stomach open similar to a c-section and I know that recovery can be painful. What should I do? Is this the part of my recovery where I come clean to everyone? I'm not ready for that. BTW, I'm not so worried about relapsing or taking pain meds during my hospital stay. I feel like my tolerance is so high it won't even be fun. I just don't want to be in extreme pain. ",1551742459.0

Not what I expected,"So this was about 3 years ago, I had smoked and sniffed heroin a bunch of times before I Ivd and never really understood the fuss. So I'm with this junky mf'er who used to he a heroin addict but was currently slamming shittons of meth to deal with quitting H. After a while of chilling and smoking my weed ( dude would smoke a bowl of my shit everytime I went to the bathroom lol) a homeless dude comes over that I had fought before. Junky #1 says ""bro let's get some H! 50 a point!"". I'd never purchased heroin before for myself so I said fuck it okay. Hand him a 50 and homeless guy and junky #1 go into kitchen to weigh it out. Naturally Im Curious about what is going on so I step into the kitchen and Junky#1 steps in front of homeless guy with the scale and says ""you gotta stay in the living room K"". I thought this was just because homeless dude was a sketched out tweaker or was still afraid of me. So homeless dude leaves and junky #1 brings bag into bathroom and says ""I'll get you a shot ready"". I'm like ""okay how many shots you think I can get out of a point after sharing some with you?"" ""Probably 2 or 3 bro"". 
     So I took 3 shots which I'm guessing were really small cuz no pin pricks or rush to be found. Then I smoke a blunt and am immediately stoned af, I was thinking damn must have smoked a super nug or something cuz I'd kind of pushed the H out of my mind disappointed in the experience. So Junky keeps going into the bathroom like 5 or 6 times and I'm starting to get suspicious that a point is 50 bucks cuz I'm the only one who bought H from the homeless dude. Jimmy is shooting in bathroom and I go into his bedroom and there is a ball of BTH the size of time. I'm fucking pissed because there is two things I hate and it's ""friends"" who lie and steal.
     Junky comes out of bathroom and sits on couch I say""can I get another shot bro"" ""nah man it's gone""
At this point I start fucking with him cuz I was still in football and basketball I'm like 6'2 205lbs and this guy is scrawny and a bitch. I pull ball of bth out of where I set it in my backpack and don't say anything. Junky doesn't even notice I pulled it out so I clear my throat and stand up and just sucker punch this dude while he's nodding on the couch then grab my shit and leave. 
    At this point in driving home and all of the sudden I can't keep my eyes open and I start to get scared because it's dark and I have about a ten minute drive to get home and I can't keep my fucking eyes open. I hold one open with my fingers while I'm driving. I make it home fine and immediately go downstairs to my room and pass out. Over the next week I finished what turned out to be .4 of the bth by smoking it. Haven't touched H since then. So I thought you were supposed to get a rush from H all I got was super sleepy after about a whole hour? Overall I used to get more euphoria from Kratom when I first started.

Even though I am excited about trying new pharmaceuticals, to be added to my list; I am kinda worried about the synergy of brotizolam and opioids. I am prescribed 30mg ms-contin (morphine sulfate extended release) for pains daily, and added clonazepam(0,5-1mg if needed) or bromazepam (3-6mg if needed) (prescribed too) for extra sedation (to go sleep, or to relieve stress.)

Should i be worried about combining the brotizolam with my daily prescribed morphine? I am not the type to overdo things, so if I get my hands on the brotizolam tablets, i'm not gonna do more than 1 per night. I would also choose to use 15mg of morphine instead of 30mg. From what I've read is that brotizolam 0,25mg is close to a 1mg rohypnol tablet etc.

I never do experience bad breathing or respiratory depression, so should I be worried? I'm getting a tripsitter during the tryout of brotizolam.

I thought I'd previously read that Clonidine and Neuroton (sp?) are 2, but I'm not sure what symptoms they help with.  Is there anything else crucial to enduring the process?  Not really looking forward to night sweats or stomach issues.  

&#x200B;

I've been thinking about quitting for a while now, but a recent development has kind of forced my hand.  I'm in pain management for legit back issues and have been prescribed oxycodone in various doses for about 15 years.  The highest dose was around 205mg per day.  I was on that for 10 years, but with all the new FDA rules and such, I have been drastically cut to around 75mg per day for the last year or so; which sucks but I've adjusted as best as I can.  I just considered myself lucky to still have a doctor willing to prescribe opiates for pain. 

&#x200B;

 All that changed a couple of days after my last appointment when the DEA raided her office.  According to her, they're investigating whether she's assisting patients with 'diverting' pain pills to the streets, which is ludicrous.  This woman is the strictest, most by the book doctor I've ever been to.  She performs random drug tests, and not just urinalysis. She's also conducted blood draws, hair follicle, and saliva tests in case patients are some how circumventing the piss tests and she's immediately discharged those that have street drugs in their system or those with none of the prescribed meds.  She also calls people in for pill counts, which I've never had to do with any doc before, and she's cut down patients (like me) with what the FDA now considers high doses.

&#x200B;

Bottom line is, she knows her shit and she complies with all federal regulations and guidelines.  According to her, she was not arrested and the DEA did not suspend/revoke her license to prescribe, but they did ask her to not to write any more until their investigation concludes.  That was nearly a month ago.  It seems to me like they've already investigated her and couldn't find anything on her, so this is the tactic they use to either intimidate legit doctors or force them to close, since technically, they can keep an investigation open for years.  

&#x200B;

As such, its probably better if I just quit and suffer rather than trying to find another doctor since they're almost extinct anyway.  I don't want to trade one dependency for another, so Suboxone is out and I can't really afford to be away from work and family to go to rehab, so I'll just try to quit cold turkey.  I know there are medical concerns with this method and it's easier said than done, but I'm going to try it.  So I appreciate any suggestions on any meds to help ease the issues I'll go through when I withdrawal.  Thanks in advance.

 tl:dr - pain management doctor is no longer prescribing and I'd like suggestions on meds to help with opiate withdrawal",1551690774.0

My relationship with dope is love hate just like anybody else‚Äôs. When I actually have money and have dope I‚Äôm on top of the world. My mood is great and I‚Äôm an overall very enjoyable person. 

More often than not though, I‚Äôm short on cash, bills pile up, making small amounts of dope stretch because I‚Äôm terrified of withdrawals. 

I don‚Äôt own a laptop of any kind and have never set up the dark net, so I‚Äôm always making 1 hour round trips to the city to pay 100+ dollars for ‚Äúdimes‚Äù and can never get my plug to actually hook me up with solid weight despite how much money I always spend. 

I‚Äôm terrified of withdrawals because I like to think I live a somewhat normal life that an entire week of being out of commission would ruin it all and give everything away completely. 

I went through it once about a month and a half ago and had to take like 6 days off from work, actually had to visit my family doctor (which costed more money) and provide doctors notes and the whole nine yards. My girl and my fam just chalked it up as me being super fucking sick with the flu until I scored more powder and leveled myself out .

So my plan is to score just like, a weeks worth of subs to get myself through the ugly part of the withdrawals and I know I‚Äôll be in so much better shape than the other times I tried quitting. I can never find anybody selling subs on the street though, and I‚Äôm just curious how these visits go with the ‚Äúsuboxone doctors‚Äù 

I saw a post about a week or two ago of a user who was pretty confident in the method of going into withdrawals on day one, and then visiting the methadone clinic for only like 3 days or something and then letting the long half-life of the methadone ride you out for the last 3-4 days of W/D‚Äôs - if you‚Äôre that user, please tell me more.

But anywhoo, I wanna try the suboxone route first. I‚Äôve used subs recreationally before and I just know they‚Äôd get me off of being sick just enough for me to function throughout the week or two it would take to set me free. I understand after that it‚Äôs all willpower and I‚Äôm confident in the fact that I hate what dope has done to me to the point that I‚Äôll be able to stay away once the physical pull is gone. 

So when you visit these doctors, do they like, have to prescribe me suboxone as an addiction remedy? I have a cousin that receives 90 8mg strips a month and he made it sound like he literally went in there and admitted his addiction to opiate pain pills, complained of a bad back and boom, he was instantly receiving scripts of this shit. 

The couple of places I‚Äôve called to attempt to set up an appointment though made it very clear that the initial doctors visit is paid for up front out of pocket, no insurance involved. 

I‚Äôm not sure if my insurance covers the actual suboxone, my luck is it does NOT, but I‚Äôve heard from this same cousin of mine that you can purchase subs from the pharmacy (with a script of course) by the single digits for like, 10 bucks a pop or something. 

I just don‚Äôt have the extra money to waste on a doctors visit that‚Äôs not going to get me anything out of it. This wild ride with this wicked drug has taken so much out of me the past 3 months and literally feel like I‚Äôm at my breaking point. 

Any advice at all would be amazing. I‚Äôm down to my last (5) dimes that I have to make stretch the next couple of days until I can sell some shit of mine to scrape up another $60-$100 and hopefully score some 4mg subs from a lady my tweaker middle man set me up with....

... what I life I‚Äôve found myself in. 


TL;DR - I‚Äôm sick of relying on dope to function, curious about what a doctors visit for some good ol suboxone entails. 


Thanks for listening y‚Äôall. Felt pretty good to just type all of this bullshit out. Sorry if it‚Äôs just adding another pity post to the sub. I know a lot of ppl on here are quite understanding and supportive though.

I enjoy writing, and I'm trying to write a piece wherein somebody overdoses on iv heroin. A part of this will be from that person's perspective, I think?

That's why I'm asking. When you overdose, for a while before losing consciousness, would you be at least somewhat aware of what's going on around you, despite being unable to respond? Or once you've reached near total unresponsivity, have you also lost your ability to take in anything from your senses?

I know these may be odd questions to ask, but I would really appreciate some input. Cheers.",1551613859.0

awr853,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/awr853/sooooo_heroin/,14,https://redd.it/awr853,FendA1,sooooo.... heroin.,"Hey everyone, im not too sure what im doing here but i thought this might be a good place to just tell my story. I'm not exactly sure why I'm doing this, but fuck it im going to do it anyway. I attempted to post to r/drugs but got a ton of hate so maybe this community might be a bit more understanding about my situation. I'm not too sure what I'm trying to get out of this, Advice? Guidance? Maybe just someone to acknowledge my existence but here goes.

So, the first time I tried heroin was when I was still a teenager (19 to be exact and 22 atm), prior to this opiates weren't exactly new to me. I had a ton of experience with oxy after my grandfather passed away and me being the sick depressed anxious person I am decided that I would steal his entire stash. Was it morally wrong? Maybe. Not really mine to say, I just remember me and my family cleaning out his house and 17 yo me finding a shoe box under his bed filled to the brim with oxy. I'm not too sure what prompted me too take them, was kind of like I was looking at myself from above, something inside me just decided to take them. I looked around the room, looked at the box, looked around the room again and shoved the box in my backpack and didn't really give it a second thought.

As you can probably guess I indulged heavily and my massive supply allowed me to maintain a steady habit. Before trying oxy i had some experience with lean but found it to be quite overrated, but good enough when combined with some good weed and Valium or Xanax, anyways im getting off topic. I remember the first night i attempted to snort 4 5mg oxys, it was futile as the amount of powder to get up my nose was enormous so the whole experience was stunted to say the least. I felt slightly giddy, sleepy and went to bed thinking that oxy was a massive letdown. The next night however i decided to just eat them instead, within half an hour i was in bliss, floating on a silk cloud, i realized how fucked up i was when i noticed that i had been simply staring at my blank laptop for over an hour, just basking in the beautiful opiate-induced sun. Needless to say, i began to take them heavily and regularly. I look back on those days with nostalgia.

I began to take them before school and soon realized that if i didn't over indulge i could quite effectively spend the entire day in the clouds and no one knew. i kept up a constant habit for 3 straight months and no one noticed, not one fucking person. I guess looking back on it now it was perfect for my personality, i was extremely introverted, shy and socially anxious so no one really could tell i was on something. i didn't have a heap of friends anyway so i'd just go to all my classes with my headphones in high as fuck, although most of my time I didn't even attend class. Preferring to isolate myself in the music storeroom playing guitar or going to the park to smoke cigarettes and read. I don't what it is but something about being surrounded by old cello's, violins, piano's and sheet music comforted me more than any other place. After school I'd typically go home and smoke weed, take more oxy and then when wait until my girlfriend at the time finished work. I'd go to hers, drop a couple more oxy, we'd fuck or just talk and then she would fall asleep while i spent the night staring at the ceiling while she slept next to me until she woke up the next morning while i had not slept and we went to school, rinse, repeat for about 3 months.

All good things must come to an end however and i had to eventually kick the habit after my supply ran out. I simply told my mother i had food poisoning and spent 2 weeks shitting and puking. However, unfortunately this was not my last contact with opiates. Fast forward to me being 19, I was still a heavy drug user but more of a poly substance abuser rather than one particular chemical. I simply took any or all opiates, benzo's, barbs and weed that i could find. For some reason, i had no interest at all in amphetamines.

Anyhow, one night, and i remember this incredibly vividly, it was dark, stormy and windy. Me and my drug buddy were spending the night getting fucked up and playing video games, waiting for our plug to arrive with some klonopin and lean. He knocked on the door and my heart rate skyrocketed as my body primed to induce kpins and sip some lean with some nice indica. He came in, we had some cones together and he gave us the shit. He was just about to walk out the door when he spun around and said 'Hey, I'm not sure if you guys are interested but i got some new shit. Managed to score some pure china white heroin.'. The mention of the H word at the time sent me for a spin and i looked at my friend. It was that look were you don't need to say anything however we both knew exactly what was about to happen.

After he left I stared at the small white rocks he had given us and both decided that i would be the one to first do it. I took a single rock out of the bag and placed it on the foil. Chasing the dragon wasn't completely foreign to me as i had done it a few times with oxy. As soon as the flame hit the foil a thick line of smoke began to rise and I attempted to inhale as much of it as i could. It tasted slightly sour, almost like vinegar. As I inhaled as much smoke as i could i held it in for as long as i could, a feeling swept over me. It felt like someone has poured a warm bucket of water over my head and as the water began to trickle down my neck all my worries, anxieties and problems simply dissipated with it. This wasn't like benzo's, barbs, alcohol or cannabis where my problems were simply numbed. With heroin, they just dissipated as easily as the smoke did when i exhaled. I let out a long sigh as i exhaled and fell back into the couch, the experience felt almost spiritual, something entirely different from anything i had done prior.

However, my plug went off to rehab for a benzo addiction the following week, so my dance with the devil was only for a night. Until recently. Through a variety of circumstances I met up with a friend I had not seen for a long time, this particular person, while incredibly down to earth and friendly had chosen a dark path in life and had started to hang out with some particular people that aren't exactly sanitary. He had started to smoke a lot of meth and began to rob people and shops and went to jail for it. One insanely bizarre experience happened when it was very late at night and i was walking home from a party or something. All of a sudden 3 people jump out of a car with t-shirt's wrapped around their faces demand my phone and wallet, when one of the boys unwrapped the shirt around his face and its my fucking friend, he turned from his drug-induced haze into the friendliest guy, asked what i had been up to, how I was doing and gave me a hug. He then apologized for the misunderstanding and they drove off, my valuables still in my pockets as i stood still thinking what the fuck just happened.

I distanced myself from him as while I wasn't exactly straight either, the shit he was doing and the person he was becoming was not something i enjoyed being around and methamphetamine was something that i neither enjoyed and also had seen a lot of my old friends fall victim too. While talking and reminiscing about the wack shit we used to get up too being young teenagers he asked if he could tell that he was on heroin, like the night i first did it the mention of the word sent my heart rate skyrocketing, i hadn't danced with the devil for 2 years but i cant say it wasn't on my mind, although buried deep in it. I asked him for his plug, knowing it was a bad decision to make but doing it anyway just like when i stole my grandfathers oxys all those years ago. He gave it to me no problems, we said our goodbyes and parted ways.

For 2 weeks i stared at the number in my phone, debating whether i should call or not. Compared to the vast majority of my friends I was doing okay in life. I had a steady job as a bartender, attended university despairingly and tried my best to indulge in music and reading while still maintaining my massive hedonistic substance abuse. Despite this my mental and physical health was horrible. I had a horrific sleep schedule, would rarely eat and then get stoned and take Xanax and eat massive amounts of fast food that would make me horribly sick. I was depressed, spending days in bed, incredibly anxious and i had practically isolated myself from everyone after high school. I had not had a intimate relationship for almost 4 years and I was lonely as fuck, finding solitude and release in pornography.

One day, after a particularly terrible day i decided fuck it, ill call. To my surprise a quiet girl answered, she asked my name and how i got this number. I mentioned my friends name, i asked for what i wanted and she texted me the address and asked that i text her when i was 5 minutes or so away. Also surprisingly was that the address she had given was only about a 10 minute drive from my home. Fuck.

I arrive and in 30 seconds a rather cute girl jumps into my passenger seat. For a moment she seems surprised, i guess i didn't look like her normal clientele, I drive a car on the nicer end of things for my age and (not to be narcissistic) I've been told that I am quite good looking and I like to keep myself relatively well kept. She looks at me and then looks at her feet, I notice the self harm marks on her arms and the tracks marks that are scattered along her armpits and legs like craters on the moon. She's about my age and despite her physically concerning attributes i found myself kinda attracted to her, i don't know if that sounds fucked up but its nice to know that other people are struggling like me ya know? She drops a small bag in the cup holder of my car, I give her the money and she mumbles something and gets out. To be honest, it was the easiest drug transaction I had ever done. No waiting around for bud and benzo dealers. The interaction was over in 30 seconds.

I drive the 10 minutes home, my heart practically in my throat, i feel sick with excitement and anticipation. I recede to the comfort of my room and look at the package. 100$ Australian Dollars for 3 small white rocks in a small plastic bag, 2 points of pure(ish) china white heroin. Again I reconsider my life leading up to this point, reconsider my decision purchasing this harmful drug but as soon as i do the inner demon comes out and like a puppet I crush the powder of 1 rock and snort and the bucket of blissful, clean, pure, holy water was once again poured over my head and down my shoulders.

That was 2 months ago, I have managed to purchase it only once a week but even this habit is expensive. I don't know where to go, i dont fit in with the junkies and i dont fit in with normal people either. Do I abandon my habit or let it consume me. I often think, maybe if i tried, that things could get better. A nice wife and some kids sounds good. Maybe i can teach them piano scales like my grandfather had done for me when i was young, the same grandfather who i stole all his pain medication from his cancer treatment after he had died. but hey, heroin sounds nice aswell ya know. The comforting spiritual bliss is a 5 minute drive away, shes always around and it has not once been a fuckaround to get.

 It's always in my mind and sometimes i swear i smell it randomly, to distance myself from this insanity i'm working 7 days a week 10 hours a day just so i have no energy to go anywhere except to go home, injest a fuckton of valium and xanax until i pass out and drag myself out of bed to do it all again. Although theres a part of me thats just thinking you're only working heaps so you can rationalize buying more H. It's amazing how quick this drug has got a hold of me. It's almost like a girlfriend, shes sweet and beautiful and makes me happy. But she doesnt love me back and when i wake up in the morning shes not they're next to me. But im still there, just a little poorer, a little weaker and wishing she'd come back with just an empty plastic bag to remind me of her.

Sorry this is so long and if you have read this far i thank you, whoever you are. I didn't intend for it to be this long but once i started typing i couldn't really stop. I kinda guess that everyone is going to tell me to stop using, I know that. I'm not sure why im writing this, just to get it out i guess even if no one reads it at all.

Anyways thankyou again, i hope you are all well, and if you're not I hope you are soon. :)",1551593008.0

One night I stole seven Ativan out of the bottle in Larry‚Äôs coat pocket while he slept in a pile of trash in the corner. It had been a hard night for me, because I was sick and mostly unable to sleep from a lack of heroin. He sat up and patted his chest to feel for the bottles when he woke up at around 10 and pulled the bottles out. Eleven pills had turned into four while he slept. He looked at me angry and desperate. I said, 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù

I made empty promises to repay him, but when he demanded proof, I ripped the microwave out of the wall and stuffed it into the red roll-around suitcase. It still had a laminated card from my grandmother‚Äôs travel agency and my own information from my flight to New Mexico. 

‚ÄúCall Luna! Tell him to bring a dub!‚Äù A dub is a twenty-dollar bag. 

‚ÄúWhat? You think he is going to want that nasty little thing? You‚Äôve lost it.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust call him! I‚Äôll deal with him when he gets here!‚Äù

Larry called our dealer, and I could tell Luna was trying to confirm that we had money over the phone, but Larry danced around it until Luna agreed to come anyway. I slid my arms into the sleeves of my NASCAR racing jacket and headed across the parking lot with Larry hobbling on crutches. It was a no. 24 Jeff Gordon racing jacket, bright red with blue flames up the sleeves and a bright blue DUPONT logo on the front. My mom had ordered it for me brand-new, to replace the old dirty one she made me throw away in California. Larry‚Äôs crutches creaked in the cold across the asphalt.

awpubg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/awpubg/post_from_a_retired_chipper/,22,https://redd.it/awpubg,staysafenodout,Post from a retired chipper,"Hey I just figured out my old password to this account, so that's why it's been six years without posting. Just wanted to share a little bit and open up a dialogue about chipping.

I wanted so badly to be able to get high on opioids and particularly heroin as a recreational substance like I did with cannabis. Oxycodone was awesome but expensive. I compare it to a completely lucid drunkish high which also gave me the feeling like I was loved and accepted. 

Getting the first needle high was the point of no return, though. I absolutely disagree with some people saying it's only about the rush for shooting up. It's free from any nausea and it felt like an even cleaner high to me. Feel free to convince me otherwise though. 

Anyway I had always promised myself that if I did 3 days on and 1 day or more off I would not get withdrawal, and if I ever broke the rule then I had to quit. This went well for about 6 months, but eventually I did a 4th day. I quit, and only relapsed a few times as a one-time thing over the next few months. I kicked for real with the support of friends and other loved ones though.

The only way I could keep it together was to smoke weed every night and focus on school. Then I graduated and had to quit that for employment drug tests. The cravings came back hard...

The best way I've found to manage without popping for a drug test is to use kratom. It barely curbs the cravings, but it works enough that besides checking this sub as a lurker daily, I don't feel tempted to cold cop in the city or anything. Luckily I seem to be completely immune to any withdrawal symptoms from kratom, perhaps it's because I only use a few grams at a time and never once experienced opiate/opioid withdrawal. Must be the partial antagonist acting like an uldn-opioid combination? I'd love to discuss this further with anyone.

The point of this post though is to show young chippers that it's not worth it. You end up thinking about dope everyday even if you quit. If you're dead set on chipping, my suggestion is to wait until you're older. if you ignore this advice it's very possible you'll end up focused on dope instead of life, and you'll be addicted and without any skills or education and no money to fall back on. Safe your money, invest it wisely, and go to the dnm once you have several million in the bank or something. Make sure you can afford a gram a day for the rest of your days as an old ass William Burroughs motherfucker, it is not a good idea to roll the dice with opiate/opioid addiction early in life.

On my way out I decided I just wanted his help. I rolled down my window and said I‚Äôll pay him if he will just come with me. He agreed and hops in my car. We go to where his people normally are. Nobody there. So we go to his backup. It‚Äôs this drunk black dude standing outside a gas station. I immediately don‚Äôt like this anymore but god damnit did I need something to hold me over til I got home. 

The dude jumps in my back seat and we go to where I thought his boy was. Turns out I was picking his girlfriend up. Whatever. We get her and finally go to the dope house. He goes in and cops me 2 10 sacks and we are outtie. I drop his girl off and I go to drop him off. He starts asking me for money. I have him 5 bucks and said bye. He got this blank stare in his eye and I started to reach for my concealed carry. He snaps back and says some dumb shit and hops out. I drop off the 1st homeless person and I finally make my way out of town

I get to a good spot and go to bust it up. It looked kinda grey. I wasn‚Äôt sure and I didn‚Äôt care but I go to smell it and what is it?! FUCKING COCAINE! I was sososo mad!

Been using scramble, developed a pretty hefty tolerance over the past two months.

Got home and did a minuscule test shot,  like tiny, because I trust my guy when he says its strong.

Using 4 oz of kratom in the following taper plan:

Day 1-2: 7g in the morning, 7 g in the afternoon 
Day 3-4: 6g in the morning, 6g in the afternoon
Day 5-6: 5g in the morning, 5g in the afternoon
Day 7-8: 4g in the morning, 4g in the afternoon
Day 9-10: 3g in the morning, 3g in the afternoon
Day 11-12: 2g in the morning, 2g in the afternoon 
Day 13-14: 1g in the morning, 1g in the afternoon

I also have 35 1mg klonopins to help with sleep and anxiety mix Lion‚Äôs Mane, tyrosine and Bromantane to help with recovery, and magnesium and melatonin to help with sleep, I also have a Juul weed pod to use as a last resort that will be available for me.

My habit this time hasn‚Äôt lasted nearly as long so I‚Äôm hoping to come off with less discomfort than last time. I‚Äôm also signed up for a gym and have been going and lifting as well as doing cardio 3 days a week and intend to keep it up throughout my recovery. I also have recently started seeing an addiction counselor that I‚Äôm hoping will help.In addition I‚Äôm adding 30 minutes of meditation 5 days a week as well as yoga on my workout days.

This past November marked 4 years opiate free and I had an interesting method to obtain this goal that I figured I would share.

I was a functioning heroin addict working 5 days a week doing $100 bags a day. Always sniffing, never got to the needle. Anyways I had tried 100s of times to quit before but nothing ever worked and the withdrawals were too much and I would always cave. I believed that if I could somehow get past the withdrawal symptoms then I would be golden- so here is how I was able to do that. 

*It is important to note that I very badly wanted to get clean and if this method did not work I was going to seek serious help and quit my job*

This is a three week ‚Äúdetox‚Äù that allows you to live a normal life, sleep, work, etc. This may not work for everyone but it did for me so I hope it can for you too. The three things you will need to complete this detox are adderall, neurontin(gabapentin, ‚Äújohnnies‚Äù), and klonopin.

The first week I would take a combination of adderal(15mg) and neurontin(900mg) when I woke up to get me through the day. Early afternoon I would take a klonopin(.5-1mg) to take the edge off. This combination of drugs is extremely euphoric(would compare it to a small roll of ecstasy) and completely took my mind off of the opiates leaving my body. I would then take another klonopin in the evening so I could sleep, rinse repeat.

The second week the opiates are completely out of my system and the worst part of the withdrawals are already over with. This week I eliminated the johnnies as to not become dependent on them, and moved my kpin usage to once a day. So adderall in the morning and kpins at night to sleep.

The third week I eliminated the kpins, but continued with the adderal in lower doses. The toughest part of this is being able to sleep, so I substituted the kpins for an OTC sleep aid (NyQuil Zzzs for instance). 

If you can successfully get through these 3 weeks you will have *hopefully* avoided dependence on the three crutches and completely avoided withdrawal symptoms altogether. Anyway it worked for me so I believe if done correctly it can work for you too.

Good luck fellow users. I have been to the depths of addiction and back and believe it has made me incredibly stronger in the long run. I hope you can all find inner peace (when you are ready of course üòâ)",1551550294.0

Now I'm freaking out.,"Hey my fellow bropiates, I've got a question for y'all. So, I just cooked up a shot of BTH same as I do multiple times a day. This time, however, I actually hit a vein immediately. That doesn't really happen anymore, so you can imagine both my surprise and excitement. So I took my shot. However, something that hadn't occurred to me before is that the time it takes me to hit a vein, is also the time my shot has to cool down. Tonight, when I hit so quickly, I took advantage of that shit. So I pushed the whole shot in. When unwrapped the belt from around my arm, immediately my thumb and the heel of my hand started BURNING like I had dunked it into boiling water. My hand IMMEDIATELY swelled up a lot. Like, so much that my thumb literally felt like the skin was going to split down the side, the skin was so tight. My skin also appeared to be burned, woth raised white and red splotches from the spot on my forearm where I hit the vein all the way down to my fingertips. The splotches have gone away, but my hand is still discolored and whiter than it should be, as well as being still swollen, though I have gotten more used it. Also, my hand went numb for about 20/30 minutes, as well. I started writing this post then, but then my asshole brother started yelling at me about how much of a piece of shit I am, and I had to put this aside for a moment. 

So, as of now, my hand is still really swollen. My thumb feels fucking huge and the pressure in it when I bend it to do fucking anything at all is awful. The spot where I initially hit and did my shot is still stinging as well. I guess my question is: has anyone had this experience before? Have I done irreversible damage? Will my thumb ever go back to normal? Is that vein still usable at all? I'm getting back on my suboxone in like 2 days, so it would really be poetic justice that the last bag of dope I bought to finish off this relapse and get back on my subs would be the bag that fucks me up for good. Lowkey freaked out, although not nearly as bad as when it first happened. ",1551530171.0

I saw one person said they got sick of waking up in withdrawal but didn't elaborate much. Does anyone have any experience with this, or quitting this med? I'd really appreciate any feedback. Thank you.",1551525748.0

Why am I feeling this way right now? My parents picked me up off the streets from a different state about two weeks ago. I was homeless and just panhandling for crack and ice. (ironically moved to this state to get clean from H, but found out the whole place is a fucking DOPE HOLE and lost every single possession I had. From my car to my apartment with ALL of my clothes in it). 


I would get ten bucks together, get a shot or a hit, and rinse and repeat. Was the same routine every fucking day. But it's not the drugs I'm missing. I can get those here. 




I miss the street life. I really don't know what it is. I loved seeing and recognizing fellow homeless people/addicts on the street, as well as being recognized by them, feeling belonged, and welcomed in a way? The conversation would always be the same every single time. Usually it'd start out with ""how much you got??"" and if we had enough we'd go half on a dime. 




I miss the drug dealers. I miss walking into the trap house or motel room to be served and feeling welcomed and belonged. I miss hitting my stem in his tents in his back yard, even though immediately after I'd  ALWAYS feel like I was being set up, by the fellow crack heads, or the dealer himself, to be arrested. 


Not one person knew my name out there. Yet I've never felt more belonged. I've never felt more like I've fit in somewhere except the streets. I also know that not a single one of those people gave a FUCK about me. They only cared if I had something they could use me for. Be it money, drugs or a connect. My head made me feel like they were 'friends', knowing full well they were the furthest thing from that. 


What is wrong with my head right now? I have no body else to vent about this to. I am posting here because I feel at least one person here has to feel the same way. I know it is not a rational feeling *at all*. 

Why would I want to go back to sleeping at Waffle Houses? Or behind abandoned buildings? Why would I want to go back to having paranoid episodes, literally so in fear of the law, that I'd throw all of my belongings, like my backpack, or my phone away to avoid possible incriminating evidence, even though I knew there was nothing in there to begin with?? 


Why would I want to go back to going WEEKS without a shower? 

Why would I want to go back to BEGGING for money? 

What the fuck is wrong with me? I'm home right now in my warm bed with my lovely dog, safe, with free food in the fridge, yet I feel home sick. Please. Somebody tell me they have felt the same. 

I miss the streets.

The one that had the son with the snitch girlfriend and was sending money to Nigerian Princes. She was also turning us, people who only bought a few for what was the standard of $6 or $7, away for people were willing to pay $10 a piece. As I noted before I had thousands to spend at her house and she turned me away for ""higher clientele""

Well, that stupid bitch just had a stroke and can't remember a damn thing! She can't even walk now! Her whole little empire has turned to shit. One of her underlings who used to sell hers for 8 a pop ten years ago back when the standard was 5 is needing us! And we are having a blast with this. She, the underling who was the Dgirl's ""business partner"" wouldn't even let us slide on 50 cent and now is begging us for the hook up!

Don't get me wrong if it were anyone else I would have compassion but, the Dgirl and her underling are getting their just deserts. When I got the news I laughed my ass off. This is why you shouldn't deny people's money simply because you think you have the power over them. Just because you have the hook up and plug or whatever the term for dealing is now, don't mean you should lord their addiction over them and try to rip people off.

If you abuse your power as a plug and mistreat the people who you knew the longest and have dealt with you the most just to make a quick buck then I really hope this happens to you. I am not going to lie I wish she had gotten busted so she could be aware of how worthless she really is but, I'll take this. Given that she can't remember shit she can't even go to her PM anymore.

AHA HA HA HA HA, Oh how the mighty have fallen!

Edit: Apparently, I am getting a lot of hate for enjoying this persons suffering. Let me explain something to you, something I think we all can relate to here. You haven't had shit in about 4 or 5 days. You have the money and had to work your ass off to get that money WHILE SICK!!! You go to this persons house and when you asked, with money in hand, and the fat old whore tells you ""Nope!"" Yet, let [Mr.BMW](https://Mr.BMW) come by with the SAME EXACT MONEY you have and simply because she thinks shes getting into the big times she magically pulls out a dildo long bottle full of Norco tens. Hell, I had done work on her computers and in her yard with the agreement that I was going to get something just for her to say ""I don't have anything"" I am sorry but, when you cheat people like that and just flat out deny them simply because you can you deserve what you get.",1551516839.0

I have a form of muscular dystrophy that really blows and takes toll on me mentally, so being sick doesn't help.  Right now I am a little dopesick but pack should show in a few hours this morning.  I pulled myself out of bed this morning and made it to my only class.  Came back and crawled into bed for almost all day.  Haven't eaten today.  It's like I am on top of my game with some fire powder.  I mean I am currently in college, and so so close to finishing.  I need to tough this out and make myself and my family proud.

It is getting harder to keep up with certain things in my life.  I have a few really cool friends, but I've lost some pretty close ones due to distance and differences in life.  Neither of my roommates use, although they sort of know I do.  I don't hide it, and they've seen me snort.  I don't smoke it or shoot.  But we all smoke weed everyday.  I've saved up almost $8000 while paying for a lot of stuff myself.  I keep myself in check and don't know any local dealers.  Don't know how to cold cop and am glad that I don't even try.  I know what a smart young man I am and the background and family I come from.

This is not how I was raised but this is who I am.  No one around me knows of my problem but its still here.  I think maybe someday soon I will talk to my mom and dad and get help.

I turn my hand over to see the faded but still prominent H burned into my hand.


‚ÄúThis one?‚Äù I say pointing to it, while I remember every ‚Äúlast‚Äù cigarette that led to my personal brand.


‚ÄúNot that one, the H is for our family. These lines here‚Äù pointing to a large, dark, carving on my forearm.


I am glad that Ty can't yet read the ‚ÄúI AM DEATH‚Äù that the lines spell out. But nevertheless I know he will press for an answer. 


I struggle in a fit of ‚Äúummm and well you see‚Äù until my wife takes notice. 


Dark curled hair frames her face, as her mahogany eyes read my silent plea for help.


Calmly she says ‚ÄúTy some things don't need an explanation‚Äù, picking him up to play with our other two boys. I mouth ‚Äòthank you‚Äô to her as she subtly smiles.


It is only the second talk during church and I'm already seeing patterns in the stucco. Staring at the words suddenly and intensely took me straight to the moment I made them. 



In a blink, I'm 21, living at my parents, driving my shitty 2001 Altima, and losing my mind again‚Ä¶



I was losing a battle with an unknown neurological disorder, or that's what the doctors thought. For a while I was prescribed various antidepressants and antipsychotics. But I was blessed with the occasional script of oxy and a monthly supply of Klonopin, but those had run out a week ago.


The grips of withdrawal had consumed me, the stabbing pain, vomiting, and constant the nausea and flu, of opiate withdrawal showed my mask dying. I had never been in benzodiazepine withdrawal before but, the mix of oxy, klonopin, and a few drinks was blissful. Alone or not I didn't care, the months supply was gone within 10 days, and then madness set in. I saw walls melt, carpets turn to water, cars change color, and voices came to whisper indistinguishable noises in my ear. After two weeks of this my sanity hung by a thread.


My ‚Äúbest‚Äù friend at the time asked me to be his best man that night, and normally I would have been excited, but in withdrawal it put a wrench in my plan to end it all. Isopropyl alcohol induced liver failure was my plan, but now I had an obligation.


Instead I decided on a new plan and began meticulously carving into my epidermis. The words ‚ÄúI AM DEATH‚Äù bled into my Meeseeks robe, followed by a baking soda chemical burn. 


Words now there forever as a reminder of the inevitable price to be paid. 


With my gaze fixed, my wife senses I'm lost again. She places her hand on my scars, she knows of the demons within. Knowing the secret habits, tastes, and slip ups, that I kept hidden. Slowly she brings my eyes up to hers and I emerged from the icy depths of my past, gasping for breath. 


After a few dirty looks I knew where I was. I tried my best to forget the words, with my wife's hand as my only anchor to this world...
