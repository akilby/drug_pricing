Long time no see... I created a new account for  anonymity 
 purposes.. So I thought I would share quickly what happened to me the past months. 

Long story short, I was addicted for like 15 years to opiates, got clean for about 10 years, relapsed 1 year, got clean almost 4 years. 

And then last year I thought I would treat myself with dope from time to time because I know the drug so well. FUCKING HELL. Why was I thinking that? It is truly incredible what a junky mind would convince you to do. 

I started from time to time, then 2x a week not more. 
I started to feel not myself on the sober days, moody, no energy, boredom... 

So I started making excuses for myself to do dope more often: a very important project at work, some family visiting the weekend, a little trip with my gf ... : all these events were an excuse to do dope to be 100% myself, in a good mood, enthousiastic (I must say I do dope to be active, never to nod)

Soon enough I was doing dope every day again. But I was telling myself I wasn't addicted - it was only a month daily. Then I tried to stop and got quite strong wd symptoms... So I continued as I had to function (work, applying for new job, family stuff..). This went on for 4 months and then I left for holidays in a country where you can get serious troubles just for weed. So I took 4g with me for the 11 days, to do a slow taper while still enjoying the time off. 

It worked pretty well I must say, only the last night I got trouble sleeping. Then back home I suffered from serious sleep deprivation (at most 2h per night) for a few days, the doc wrote me off work so I chilled at home, using kratom very sparingly. I'm not even sure it was doing anything to be honest. 

I ate very healthy, I forced myself to go to the gym even if that seemed impossible. Lot of fruits , (vegan)  protein shakes and B12/5hTP.  

It is now day 10, I feel great , I am so happy I don't have to score and do dope every day anymore.  I can't say what the future is made of but I certainly will not allow myself to do dope even 2 days in a row and at least a month between. I would tattoo this on my arm if I could!

So if you think of doing dope again, think it over: you will be hooked again in no time without strict discipline.

(X-Post R/Drugs),"Hey guys, kind of new to this sub I haven't posted much. I use drugs occasionally and have tried quite a bit. However, I never thought that i would EVER try heroin. Due to the stigma attached to use. So, story is I was looking to buy Percs from somebody from work. Turned out the connect I came in contact with has had a hard time getting Percs lately. He offered me dope, and I immediately said NO.

He texts me a couple hours later and tells me he's got some awesome moon rocks. I couldn't resist because I love pot, I go and meet him to get my moon rocks. As soon as I get there he goes ""yo man I know you said you don't want any dope or blow, but just take this line of coke to try and get back to me about it"". I take the tiny baggy with hesitation. Later on as were chatting in the car, curiousity gets the best of me and I ask if he has any dope on me. He goes ""yeah I always carry a bit on me, want some?"" I say"" uhhhhh.... sure?"" he hands me a small stamp bag. Drive back home, break the powder out of the stamp bag because I'm not dumb enough to insufflate it all with ZERO opiate tolerance. I stare at the beige powder for around 5 minutes... contemplating. I decide fuck it I'm not doing heroin at this point in my life. I leave the powder there and go to bed.

Tonight I get back home from an extremely rough 11 hour shift at work. I spot the powder on the counter and decide it's time. I'm the type of person who absolutely MUST try everything at least once and this includes drugs. I hate hearsay and opinions. I do some research online to make sure I don't snort this shit and die. I start off with a few baby bumps spaced 5-10 minutes apart. At first I thought ""damn this shit fucking sucks I just feel kinda tired"" . I could'nt have been more wrong. Each tiny bump I took, I got higher and higher and HIGHER. I was pretty high after my last bump (i finished the bag). Thinking that was the highest I was going to get, I drove to the convenience store half a mile away to get some liquids in me. I get back, sit down, and open my drink. And holy shit it hits me there... I'm MERKED. Nodding out on the couch, probably the best feeling I have ever had. Oddly I started getting a little anxiety at the peak of the high. But it shortly subsided.

It didn't feel too much difference than when I dabbled with hydrocodone a few years back. All in all amazing, and can easily see why people get addicted. But at the perfect dose, as I seemed to be able to achieve out of complete dumb luck. I think this stuff can be respected like anything else as long as you have respect and willpower. The biggest problem is it's from the street and you don't know what is in it. I won't be doing this stuff again for quite a bit of time, if ever.

The alluring charm of heavy opioids, except this time preceded by something new (something entirely different but equally if not more amazing). Wake up, eat a protein bar on the move, and hit the road. I was only halfway between my transition from snorting chipper (once or twice a week) to IV junky. Psychologically however, I was fully converted. That’s the reality of it. You're mentally hooked from day one. It usually takes years to get physically addicted in most cases. Shooting speeds this up drastically. Chasing that rush day in and day out takes its toll on tolerance. Well this was my year...

Somedays, I just walked. I would tell mom I was going to my neighbors, a video gamer friend of mine. She is on good terms with him so she usually seemed to believe me. In the back of my head remained the anxiety: ""what if she texts him, or goes to town and passes me?"" I was way too focused for that type of thinking. I was loyal to that spike already, so I grabbed mine out from under a little bundle of twigs, just obscured from the view of my front porch by the three sky scraping pines poking towards the heavens. The same pine trees I used to climb up in with buddies when we were young are now used to give me the privacy to continue my degeneracy unnoticed.

I tuck the rig in between my waistband area. God, do I hope that cap doesn't come off... not that it would matter. I hadn't seen any action in that area since the first time I shot oxymorphone.  My romance had shifted from human attraction to chemical and the masochistic degradation of my own body. Oh it's a used needle? No problem.. I’ll just bleach it. No bleach? No worries, you don't catch HIV/hepatitis from just sharing once right? (I google the results and find the percentage is less than 1% chance of contracted HIV from a dirty pin prick). 

By the time I was almost ready to begin hitting myself I was routinely offered to ""shoot some cocaine maaan"" by Dillon's dumbass, the usual term Dan referred to him as, fittingly. He came to me immediately asking to use my phone for his online auctions, and if I let him he will give me a shot of coke. I nervously agree as we walk behind the drug den. I wave to Roxanna on the front porch. ""Hi sweetie!"", she says heartwarmingly. Well she must be high. I briefly feel relieved knowing I don't have my mom's 250$ bike with me today, to leave in the yard of a junky candyland.

I hand Dillon my iPhone reluctantly once we're inside the screen doors which lead to the laundry room (aka shooting gallery of this little old lady's home she shares with about 5-10 addicts at any given time). I still don't quite understand it all but only a couple were related to her. Dillon commands Dan to prep the coke shot. ""Give ‘em 10 units maaan. That's all he needs"" Alright sure, even though it didn't sound like much. Little did I know...

Dan professionally preps the shot, pouring out the white powder and rock mixture onto a soda cans bottom, drawing up 30 or 40 units of warm water from a nearby glass and squirting it on the coke, on the bottom of a coke can. It was at this point I pull out my rig. ""Man is that the same one you been using?"", asks Dan.""yeah man..."" 

""Okay this stuff is too good to miss and it's dangerous, too. We need to get you a fresh rig. I'll bleach mine for you"" Sounds intriguingly like a terrible idea, but I care not. I'm a regular IV user of pills which are made of rubber or concrete I'm really not sure which (endo opana). Bring on the danger. Coke in a dirty used rig couldn't be much worse, right? Well, surprisingly enough, it was in the case of missed shots. I glance down at Dan's leathery tan hands and notice the band-aid on his wrist. 

""Oh you wanna know how I got that huh?"" He notices my gaze set on his wrist. Before I answer, he continues, ""shootin’ fuckin’ cocaine... I'm getting too old for this shit now. Now when I was younger I could go go go... but nowadays I cant hardly handle the damn comedown."" He rips off the band-aid, and I see this awful boil looking thing I come to know good and well later as an abscess. It's an infected area from missed shots and his was from cocaine which is brutal as fuck. I mean it numbs your teeth so it surely numbs your whole damn arm if you miss. It was fine. I trusted Dan's years of degenerate pseudo doctor experience and my trusty young and plump veins.


""Oh that comedown shit sucks, huh?”, I asked with an ignorant tone. “I know it always did when I sniffed this stuff a couple years back."" I say trying to switch gears from imagining a potential abscess in my future. I also now see he has the needle ready and filled with 30 units of cocaine solution. ""Get that bleach there and pour a cap full and meet me out back in the pool room. You will wanna be outside and in fresh air for this.. you're gonna puke. All of us do our first time"". 

I somehow thought nothing of it, and just followed his instructions. I went out the sliding screen and glass doors, walked a few steps towards an old worn down, open-faced shed with a pool table and many empty soda cans, used needles and ashtrays. Poison ivy was the outer decor and broken windows painted the inside with a bleak picture. Just the spot to shoot up some powerful, stimulant drugs. 

I finish rinsing my rig for the millionth time with water to remove all the bleach after I draw up a bit in it. Don't wanna risk shooting bleach, so I ask the pros what they think. (Dillon has already shot his and thrown up as per tradition. He was waiting outside all too excitedly ready to see me shoot it.)

""Nah, you're good man. That's plenty"", says Dillon. Dan nods in agreement. That's good enough for me too then. I was shaky and nervous and sweaty from withdrawals already kicking in. No point in doing my opana shot first though.  I’ll *need* it to come down.  I was too excited myself to worry about my symptoms. ""Don't worry"", says Dan with confidence, ""the coke kills the sickness for a few minutes and we will get your other shot ready so you don't come down at all."" 

They always wanted to prep it. Thinking back I was probably less addicted from Dan masterfully sneaking the thicker part of the goop and re-adding water. We've all witnessed him doing it, but said little. We were too dependent on all his connections.  I was also dependent on his nurse skills (it really sucked when no one else was around and Dillon had to register for me...). He registered in my vein just as quick as I could say I'm ready and there spurts the red mistress, ""oh I'm coming"", she whispers in my ear. I know it is time. Dan presses down the plunger and immediately I hear sounds become sharper. Vision becomes intensely vivid.  I gotta walk! I gotta get on my bike! I exhale sharply and smile.  Dillon's yellow crooked teeth stare at me taunting me with how much he is enjoying this. I fast walk past him and smell vomit. It doesn't affect me now. I’m content just pacing circles in this uncut yard. My mind is working at optimum capacity. All my hustles line up. ""Okay, gotta ebay this and that! Work this odd job, maybe steal this or flip that."" I already knew I needed more of this fantastic experience, but I didn't know I would end up needing it daily. 

My endorphins were firing off so fast it felt like my brain was being caressed by a goddess, or serenaded by a beautiful jazz singing lady from decades past. I had felt the white girl's kiss, and it felt oh so good. ""Dude, are you gonna puke?"", asks Dillon. I imagine I look pretty funny just sitting on the concrete staring into the grass, lost in rapid thought. I finally reply, ""nah dude, I feel better than ever."" As soon as I spoke, I felt the hint of a comedown already. I glance at my phone. Five minutes have passed. What have I been doing?

 That was every coke rush. It made me so energetic, yet so paradoxically blissfully relaxed. I briefly consider the possibility I have ADD but then I realize it is probably just the rush itself that is calming me down. It is kinda how I imagine a pure adrenaline shot would feel or close to it. Maybe more euphoric. Maybe less. I’m not sure. All I know was that it is the craziest feeling I have ever felt. I had to have more, yet there was no more. Not yet. There was more work to be done first.  I'm coming down hard now and glance at the already prepped oxymorphone solution. I salivate.

On june 30th I left my parents house and entered detox/rehab with the intentions of kicking my dope habit and addressing the underlying issues of my use.  

While quitting was the goal, sub matienence (the true addict way: take some sparingly, usually when broke/sell some and make an earnest attempt at maintaining) was in mind.  

Methadone and vivitrol were faux candidates entertained only when conversing with those who I needed to sell my recovery to. 

What happened though was the same shit I'm used to everytime (10plus) I enter a treatment center: sulk, complain and romanticise the use.. Usually with someone whose validation I crave. Eventually my addict brain thinks of a way to obtain money from family. So I leave detox with newly met friend... Get high. go on a run.. Reenter detox. 

This has happened all too often.  However, Fast forward a few weeks and I'm in an outpatient program and on a redic dose of subs (on the days I take them)

But, It's not that I'm craving or chasing dope though.  Now that I'm no longer waking up sick in the grips of heroin, ive fallen prey to the brief but intense hold of crack.

Crack began, for me, as a ""if I have cash after buying a sufficient amount of dope "" sort of thing.  But its evolved to the cravable drug of the moment for me.  I don't even know if I fully like it all that much... 
It's weird... 
I just sort of go on autopilot after that first hit. 

Anyway...

To conclude this shit post, i am just wanting to know how those who've ridden the ride already have handled the transition. Its nothing new to have a junkie kick the habit in form of matienience and start on crack, coke or meth.

I am starting to feel realllly high after just a .3 tester shot lul.

So today's story, after finding a little under an eighth of pollen in my room lastnight and getting hella baked had alarm set for 8am. Had enough tobbaco left for a morning jay. Woke up had last couple puffs off bedtime jay. Set alarm to 9am.

Gonna fast frward a bit cos I'm starting to feel real high and wana get off phone and enjoy it lol.
Had wake n bake joint + morning coffee, showered got dressed and got bus to the city.

Once in the city done 2 ""loops"" whilst hand tapping (asking ppl for money for a ""bus"") enough money for some dope. Forgot to add, I had managed to get tobbaco + cigarettes of a couple peeps so I cud smoke some jays of pollen.

It went quite well and at the end of the second loop I was only 1.80 of £10. So started asking the various homeless avout who had just to see if anyone around.

Whilst sitting asking one homeless who had, a dgirl I recognised from the past, passed by us and asked if we were looking. I said I was but was 1.80 she said that was fine and went into little bit behind big arch we were stood at and asked me to keep look for popo.

Not sure if she was taking some out of a bag there or not seen as I was 1.80 short but idc.

Went into posh restaurant across from where we were and to the toilets.

Now I believe it's #3 we have here, brown powder from afghan.

But yh I could tell how fire this stuff is from smell.. STRONG VINEGAR!

Test shot was a .3 and rush from that was actually quite intense, when I started writing this.

Oh I'm outside having a smoke on bench away from that posh restaurant now lol

I had another .4 shot in toilet as no one seemed to mind / notice how long I had been in there, about 15mins roughly.

But yh this stuff is dy-no-mite!

Hope ur all well today guys n gals.

At first I liked this guy. But over time he literally complained about the idea of seeking out regular dope. Regular being heroin with little to no fent.

He told me no one wants heroin. But he walks around saying he's selling dope. So he's selling what people secretly want...fent heavy it pure fent. Heroin isn't strong enough. He claims to sell it but no one wants it!! They want pure fent. I told him he could get 100 to 300 from me on the reg but he just had to try and stick with real dope.

No one wants it. But he claims to have it...but doesnt want to loose his edge by selling it.

So waiting for a guy who made me feel like a pos for wanting real dope I saw another lady who asked if I was waiting for some dealers who work out of a bar. I'm not. But I am looking for good dope. I promise her a point if she can find 3 for 50.

So she introduces me as an old friend. The dope is all in one bag so I score her a 20 dollar bill. 

This is the dope I've beem waiting for. The .3 bag I got was amazing. So today I called buddy and asked for 100. He said sorry I only do points. I explain I know he doesn't do price breaks and that's ok. I want to SPEND 100. To get a half gram. 

He hooks me up. I hear him count out 5 bags...1... 2.. 3.. and so on. 

But in the end I end up with 10 bags!! He did seem high and distracted when counting. And the bags were sorta sticking together. But surely these were half points? ? But I heard him count. He said...with a heads up... next time he can put it all in one bag. That biggest bag is the first one I got -over a week ago- it was .3 The last couple of shots are from this latest 'batch'.(Seems like the same dope tho) So the pics are a little out of order.

I really dont want to pay another 100 for his mistake. But idk if he even made a mistake!!

I'm going to get another 100 to 200 before the weekend cause its my bday and I took time off... 5 day weekend. Up two from my regular 3 day weekend. Which is every weekend. 

I'd like to say nothing. Or hey did you accidently toss in an extra or two. I'm thinking it's possible these are half point bags.

Who here would actually ask if he made a mistake???

Unlike the fent slut I really like this guy  and I think he's probably middling or just knows he's one of the few in the ghetto not pushing heavy fent and he knows some people-like me-will happily pay a little more for classic dope.

That's how much this fent fucker has messed me up. I'm calling REAL HEROIN CLASSIC DOPE!!

Fent fucker logic:
No one wants what he claims to have anymore(heroin)...while he's  giving people what they 'secretly'(???)want(fent) cause otherwise he'd ""loose"" his ""edge"".

He needs to call fent heroin/dope and yet deep down people want fent!!!

Kinda-sorta a shitpost but recently both oxy in the form of percs and opana in the form of 40's have made themselves available to me for really cheap. I'm not a huge fan of opana because when I snort enough for a really good rush, it makes me uncomfortable in a way I can't explain. 

My lungs feel funny and my body gets physically anxious even though *I'm* not anxious at all. That being said, when I partake in  opana I usually bump small amounts until I'm good and high...just not all at once.

Percs are now in season and after picking a few dozen off the Oxy bush I usually eat 6-8 of them and then 30 -40 mins later do a tiny bump of opana and 15 mins later, holy shit. It bumps the oxy euphoria up to a new level and stays there.

Fucking awesome combo and done **safe** as well.

Please don't go doing large lines of each unless you know what you can handle!

Opana is opposite of oxycodone insofar as the BA of oral vs nasal.

- Oxycodone has a BA of 87%+ when eaten but a 60%+ BA when snorted :( .
- Opana has a BA of *10%* when eaten (terrible) but has a 40-60% BA when snorted!

It's literally 4-6 times stronger in your nose. That said, if you eat a 10mg opana and it fucks you up, **do not** think you can snort the whole thing and be ok.....you **won't** be ok.

My family doctor is doing this as a favor to me and doesn't actually have any experience with the subject. He seems to be a bit worried about medical boards and such, and I want to put his mind at ease with references to other doctors doing this kind of treatment. For my purposes mentions of opiates for depression, bipolar etc will all be sufficient. I've already found quite a few articles supporting my position but its hard to find doctors who stand by this treatment publicly with their name, so far I've found one, Dr. Robert Cochran. Otherwise I've found a few articles, and lots of mentions that opiates were the first line of treatment for anxiety disorders before the fifties but no evidence in form of case reports or anything. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Tl;Dr a list of doctors who support opiates for mental health, and any other mentions of it would be great.

PS: I'm not looking for anyone to tell me it's a bad idea or it won't work. It does work, better than benzos which have all the same side effects dependency and tolerance etc. For purposes of this I don't care how badly opiates ruined your or your loved ones life etc. If you're a professional doctor or psychiatrist your opinion is welcome but it's not really what this thread is about.

I've had chronic pain for over a decade now. I ended up being prescribed injectable demerol at 16, and needless to say, I fell down the rabbithole. I got clean. I didn't touch opiates for years. I tried all the other meds for my condition with no luck. Unfortunately, my condition worsened, and my pain grew everyday. After exhausting all my options, I ended up on Kadian 20 mg twice a day and diuladid 10mg for breakthrough - only 10 a month. I did really well and was diligent. I never ran out of meds. But, that wasn't cutting it. My pain was still pretty awful and was affecting my work. 

I moved and had to get a new doctor. He put me on 6 10mg Percs a day and 2 Oxy IRs a day. This caused me to have an issue. I could feel like a ""normal"" person again. Up and up my tolerance went, and fuck. Now of course I'm out of meds feeling like shit, and my doctor randomly fucking quit 2 Fridays ago, citing personal issues, and referred me to other doctors. The person he referred me to is a complete idiot and is a primary care doctor who flipped shit when he saw my meds, even though I passed alllll of my urine tests. 

After much debate and fight, he agreed to write me for 20 mg Oxy ERs and 2 10mg percs a day for breakthrough pain. I'm taking a hit in meds, but I'm not left without. Now, my question is, how do you deal with chronic pain and not fuck up like I did? I asked for ERs because - 1 fuck tylenol, and 2, I knew he wouldn't write me for what I had. I seem to do muccchhhh better on ERs for not abusing since it's not like the hay day when I did use - lookin at you Oxy 80s. I want controlled pain, but I also don't want to go through fucking myself over every month. I will say I no longer take them to nod. I take enough to get a little buzz so I can feel good, get things done, work, etc. I'm not going hardcore like I used to, and I surprisingly don't want to. I just want to be normal.

I'm jealous of people that can get clean and not have chronic pain. I feel like if I never had chronic pain, I may never be here, but I can't what if because it's been over a decade, and I'm fucked for life. Plus I made my choices to venture down the rabbithole.

Any advice is appreciated!

My first opioid was Codeine, which made me feel vaguely stoned and VERY nauseated. I didn't feel itchy, and had reduced tactile feeling. The codeine came in the form of 60mg prescription blister pills, and was legit.

Next came DiHydroCodeine, which is codeine but 2x as potent. Again same experience, only less nausea and a bit of a mood lift.

I then came across a rather rare opiate; Opium. From the darknet, it was smoked on a few separate occasions. I felt stoned and mildly euphoric, but not at all anything I could see anyone getting ""addicted"" to. The issue is that everyone and their dog seems to love opioids and the fact of the matter is they are universally highly addictive, so clearly I'm the one not getting it rather than literally everyone else on earth.

I recently came across quite a few 2mg Hydromorphone pills (little orange ones) straight from the Rx bottle of a close friend who got the script but was afraid to ever use them. Also known as Dilaudid, these are known as the pinnacle of opioids by many users allegedly. I looked up the appropriate dose, and proceeded to rail 2mg after ingesting an antihistamine, and then 30 minutes later rail 2 more. I am hypothetically peaking rn and while I feel sedated and my breathing reduced, I'm again only getting a moderate euphoric mood lift.

My point being from all this is that Adderall, Coke, M and such all blow this feeling out of the water, and yet from how people talk about opioids this shouldn't really be the case. Is it something wrong with me? Is it only ""meh"" for me since I've never legitimately been in actual med-long term pain before, kinda like how xanax etc. are only euphoric for anxious people?

**TL;DR I react the same way to opioids as people without anxiety react to xanax; not really any euphoria, and yet this seems impossible. Any ideas why?**

I've lost my father to drugs, probably the only man who will ever truly love me, you've all read the stories of my mother so that is kind of expected as well, my brother favors his cocaine like our daddy but he has been given the wrong powder on several occasions so I'm endlessly worrying about him as well now. And me? I want to stop, I was almost out of it I wasn't getting withdrawals anymore so I was doing good I suppose. But once the heart wrenching news hit I've been hiding trying to mask the pain of losing another person. 

I don't see everyone that loses people constantly does it. 

I'm so close to hiding out in my grandpa's house and pretending like there is no monsters under my bed anymore. 

I lost another job because I lost my car. My mom goes out to the driveway to meet the dopeman because I can't even drag myself out of bed to do that much. 

Someone took me out for ice cream at this little off the beaten path that I went to all the time as a kid the other day to try to get me out of my funk. I couldn't even be bothered to shower, much less be semi sober. My poor cousin knows I use, but he has never seen me slumped over only sitting up to puke because I did more than I thought I could. 

My life is absolutely miserable and it's because of drugs. If you're considering trying drugs, don't. The fun times are truly not worth the bad times. And yes there will be an aftermath. 

I wish I could go back to being 19 and save my dad and try life over, I know I would do it way differently. I've been depressed before but never like this. 

This is a shitpost because I'm not sure I have anywhere else to vent or go. 

The only reason I even try to consider keep going is because of my animals. I look at my kitten's face and remind myself she doesn't deserve to end up in a shelter because I want to end my pain. ",1503360927.0

Antidepressants don't do a damn thing for me and I've been on many.

It got so bad that I ended up popping an Oxy (use recreationally on a monthly basis - and I know that nobody can use recreationally and addiction is inevitable). 

So after 30 mins the depression just absolutely vanished and I could function normally again.

I know opiates aren't a viable anti-depressant. But man, I WISH so much they could make an anti-depressant that were this effective.

Now I told the suboxone doctor I am on those meds and he told me I have to tell my psychiatrist that he'll be taking me off those meds to stay on the suboxone; however he said they do not contact my psychiatrist, it's up to me to bring a letter basically. Now it I have 60 days, my plan was to go there for a month until I have the money to go see another suboxone doctor who told me it's okay for me to be on those meds, just bring a note from my psychiatrist saying he allows it.

Now here's what I'm worried about. I don't know if my psychiatrist will allow me to be on all of these controlled substances at once. And due to my passive nature he can easily walk all over me by not speaking up for myself but I do speak intelligently to doctor regarding everything in medicine and I recognize that doctors appreciate this & like this about me. So what's on my mind is:

1) if I just don't say anything about being on suboxone to my psychiatrist today, can he see somehow that I'm on it regardless within this week period?

2) I am eventually going to tell him I'm on suboxone but I rather wait until I'm at the pain management doctor who writes the suboxone & I'll be paying cash which shows Im really working to better myself and not just get free drugs from doctors, and not the addiction facility where I'm getting this suboxone where I am getting it for free. 

3) how could I communicate that I'm on the suboxone and it legitimately is helping me with all of my pain/depression but I do really, really need my Ativan for my panic attacks I get and my Adderall for when I really need to keep focused on important tasks such as work, school, etc. and I am still going through minor benzo withdrawal as well so that Ativan feels almost essential to my living, regardless the suboxone is working beautifully for almost everything.

People send me PMs asking me all the time things like ""You live with a partner who doesn't know you use - how do you get away with it??"" and ""It's amazing and really impressive how you keep your habit under wraps, can you give me any pointers?"" etc, so I thought I'd elaborate in a thread. 

I've been living with my partner for just under a year. She is aware that I had a drug problem when I was younger, but has no idea that I still use. She is wildly anti-drug, and has never so much as taken a drag of a joint. However, for our entire relationship I have been an I.V. heroin user and have dabbled in many other substances, and she doesn't even suspect me of using.

The foundation of my deceit is the shower injection. I have a large, opaque container of shower gel that I've cleaned out and modified to make it water tight, and inside are my works are drugs. I ensure that my partner never runs out of her own lady soap and shower gel so that she wont ever have to use mine. 

The bathroom door isn't locked when I do this, as this would arouse suspicion, but since she assumes I'm taking a dump and then having a shower she has yet to come in unannounced. If she ever does, the shower curtain is opaque so she wouldn't immediately see what was going on. 

I draw water from the shower, and then stand at the other end of the tub so I can cook my shot. I find the heat & steam very helpful for bringing my veins up and allowing me to hit them, most of the time a tourniquet isn't even necessary. After an incident where I came very close to passing out, I ensure now that I don't stand in the actual hot water while shooting up - for some reason this can make me really light-headed. Then, you just shoot up as usual, but take care that when cooking that you are far away from the actual shower - if your bathroom can't facilitate this, then cook it up outside of the shower or with the shower off. After injecting as usual, it's really nice actually because the clean up process is very simple. I replace all my works and every bit of evidence that would show my partner that she's not actually what I love the most in this world, and then just take a shower. 

This just ensures that I Can have my morning fix without stressing about her finding out. The only person that found out about it was my cousin who had stayed at our place and then went to take a shower - thankfully, he has been concealing the fact that he's cheating on his wife with three different women and that he's bisexual (she's deeply religious), so though he was somewhat surprised/disappointed/concerned, he was in no position to expose me and didn't. 

I usually shoot up three times a day. To have my afternoon fix, I will either leave to ""go to the gym/library/job centre"" etc and take it out of the house. I figure if I had my morning and my afternoon shot at home when my partner is there, I will really really increase my chances of getting caught. My partner always wants to be around me, so if I went to a different room for a significant length of time she'd follow me, and if I take a shower in the afternoon she will often hop in with me, so I have to do it out of the house. 

For my evening shot, I just have to wait till she's asleep. She always, always falls asleep way before me, so I go to the basement where I'd have plenty of warning if she was approaching (never happened yet) and take my hit. The first 2 hits of the day are just maintenance, if money permits I save the shot I do for actual pleasure for this one. Though I've been on heroin every single day I've known her, once or twice if I've underestimated the potency of the H or got a little reckless, I've been obviously sedated & fucked up around her, and have had to pass it off as exhaustion from the gym I pretend to attend or that I have a headache so I took some OTC painkillers (for which she will actually rebuke me, even if it was fucking aspirin she tells me I don't need it and that I should be careful). After that I realized I needed to be more careful, so I only get fucked up late at night. Several times I've woken at like 4AM in the morning with my syringe hanging out my arm on my chair in the basement, but my partner has never discovered me. 

I don't feel remotely bad about any of this. My partner is almost completely intolerable sometimes, and though I'd like to have both if forced to choose I'd pick heroin over her 100% of the time. If you're not stealing or doing anything else immoral to them, then do *not* let yourself feel guilty, at all. I honestly don't see anything morally wrong with concealing a drug habit from your loved ones as long as it's not effecting them - what you put in your body is your business, and if you don't want to stop or don't feel that you can, then its' pointless sucking your SO into your shit and your problems, hurting them like that in my book is far more immoral than being duplicitous in concealing it from them.

There you have it. You guys can stop PMing me now, you know. This turned into one long boring rant that didn't provide much of value, but it's true.

**TL;DR** hide drug habit by shooting in the shower. hide works inside an empty bottle of shower gel. if they wouldn't approve and you don't want to stop then don't tell people you use. ",1503500138.0

Got locked in elevator 3hr withdrawing,"Worst day of my fucking life. I quit dope 24 hours ago but was having real bad withdrawals so I decided to give in. I called my connect and was on my way to meet him. 

As an aside the elevators in my building have been messed up but I didn't think about it. I got in and started going down (this elevator has had the speaker mic thing broken and on. For the last few days so it's been screwy). This girl gets in with her friends and a dog and we get to the middle of the 5th floor and all of a sudden I feel a jerk. 

The fucking elevator broke! I was like okay it's fine. I'm sweating like crazy to tired to stand and skin is crawling. I figure 5-10 min. Well 5-10 min pass I text the dealer I'm stuck but coming he says quick has to be somewhere in 30 min. So I start freaking out and bashing buttons but nothing is working. The management is on the speaker sayin the fire department was on there way soon. I was basically sitting on the floor freaking out and these 4 girls are also screaming making everything worse. 

40 min pass and I need to shit so bad. I'm a fucking mess and my dealer is saying if I'm not there in 10 he is leaving. So I freaked and told the fire department (they we're on speaker trying to open the door) that I was diabetic and needed to get out or I'm going to faint. They said nothing they could do. 20 min go and the dealer says he has work and is leaving. I just started crying and next thing I know I have four girls trying to comfort me telling me we will be out soon and it's okay. I couldn't even hold it in and was so upset I let them all hug me. It didn't make me feel better. 

30 more min passed and we were finally out. All the girls started acting like I was one of their bffs and were hugging me and jumping cheering we were out and I could ""get my diabietes medicine"" and I was okay. I just held my head down and said ""it's too late"". 

The worst part is I was so sick and he dealer was gone so I had nothing to do and was to scared to take the elevator so had to walk up 12 flights of stairs back to my apartment withdrawing. I was so tired I stopped 4 times and just laid in the stairwell shivering. 

I'm still sick but in bed now at least. Worst day ever. ",1503495163.0

I'm watching this show (The Killing--fucking awesome show, check it out) and there's this scene and I swear to fucking god it's straight out of my memories. It's a bunch of kids at a youth shelter sitting around waiting to see who gets beds. When I was homeless I spent one night in a shelter (I was maybe 17 or 18) but it was set up in exactly the same way, and I hadn't thought about it in such a long time. I was still in --city-- and my fiance was still alive and I was still okay being a little junkie streetpunk. 

But, now, 14, 15, 16, 17 years later, I'm sitting in my own fucking apartment, having just been asked by my boss to take a more permanent position at my job, looking at the small but still positive numbers in my bank account, and I've come a really fucking long fucking way from that kid who squatted under bridges and shot tar into her femoral and neck and watched all her friends die and panhandled day in day out in the rain and the snow. 

A couple years ago-- shit, a few fucking months ago-- things were so fucking bad that I honestly didn't know if I'd wake up the next day, or even if I wanted to at all. I let shit get away from myself, in a major way, in ways that I won't talk about but can't be fixed. I didn't think that anything mattered anymore, because I was just waiting around to die. 

So, uh, yeah. Point being, um.... shit's rarely as hopeless as you think it is. Maybe. I mean, maybe it is. But what if, just maybe, your life takes a fucking 180 turn? Don't do anything irreparable to yourself, or to others. Even the worst circumstances can change. Maybe. Or maybe not. I don't fucking know. 

I'm a long way from being clean so this isn't meant AT ALL as a ""don't do drugs, kids"" PSA. Just want to say that I have faith in all of you, and maybe shit won't work out for you. But maybe it will. I hope it does. I wish I hadn't acted like nothing would get better, the past 17 years. That's all.

No other opiates, just straight to the top.

Why? I was happy. Full time student, full time job. Friends, family, the works.

That wasn't good enough for me. I wanted to live life on hard mode. 

Everyone knows that if you use heroin regularly, you will be **fucked** eventually.

But I was going to be the one who proved that wrong. People succeed all the time while clean and sober. I was going to do it while nursing a healthy dope habit, just to prove I could.

It was exciting. Dope deals, cold cops, the tricks of the trade. The dope game itself got me high.

The actual dope however, was different. Going straight to heroin with no tolerance sucks. The first few times were miserable; vomiting, unbearable itching, inability to swallow or piss, dehydration...but I persevered. 

It's easy to use responsibly when the experience is miserable. So I thought I really was different, because I didn't fall in love overnight. But, after gaining a little tolerance, *love, thy name is heroin.* 

Quickly, I discovered that a little bit of heroin would give energizing euphoria. A little more would give bliss. And a little more would give sweet, sweet sleep. Who needs any other drugs -or anything else at all- when you've got a substance that does it all? 

You know the rest of the story: more use, more tolerance, more money, people find out, more lies, loss of trust, the whole fucking thing. My beautiful heroin was suddenly ruining my life. I crashed my car. Relationships down the drain. I didn't go back to college. I was on the verge of losing my job. Debt. Needles. I wasn't different. I couldn't use responsibly. 

So I did what any sensible person would do: I checked into rehab to get a free pass. And it worked. I even tricked myself into believing I was serious.

Fast forward. A couple years of clean time, off the suboxone, great relationships, on good terms with family and friends, I'm back on top! All thanks to a lack of heroin in my life.

But I had a five week gap between quitting my old job and starting my new, prestigious career. The boredom blew me away. Unemployment is fucking awful. Life is so bland I begin to crave the excitement of the dope game. The suspense of making life 100x more difficult by using heroin. 

So I roll the dice on a cold cop, and it works. Sweet suspense, the rush of meeting in a parking lot and doing the deal, wondering if it's a sting, or bunk, or dangerous, and getting away with it. Of chopping out lines in broad daylight on the side of a busy road and railing them for all to see. It was better than the high itself. 

Because the high was no good. I was puking, and itchy, and miserable because I did too much with too little tolerance. But I was back on top! I was succeeding and I had my secret narrative again! I was kicking ass and doing it all while maintaining my secret life of **Mr. Responsible Junky Man.**

Right now, I'm not spending too much money, or lying, or descending into the hell of active addiction...yet. But this last use, I felt that old and familiar warm, fuzzy bliss. I told myself this was the last run, because I need to be at my best to succeed in this new job. But that little voice is telling me, ""Succeed? Anyone can succeed, but only a true genius can succeed while maintaining a heroin habit. Are you just another brick in the wall or are you a winner?"" 

Fuck. I know how this game ends. I know the absolute, suicidal misery of rock bottom. And here I am, writing a novel about how I've got my life back on track for the first time since 2012, all because I stopped using heroin...and justifying using heroin because I want to be the hero in my bullshit narrative. 

I know how I sound. An egotistical asshole, treating opiate addiction like it's beneath me despite *knowing* that I will get destroyed by it. 

But.

I don't need to be better than anyone. I just need to *think* I'm better than everyone. And what better way to do that than by picking up the habit that destroyed me last time and doing things differently? I don't think it will end differently, but who doesn't love a good challenge...

I live on the South Shore of Massachusetts. I witness opiate addiction play out frequently in the lives of people, you and old. 

I have been a lurking on this sub for months but I have had an interest in addiction, opiate addiction particularly, for much longer than that. 

I occasionally smoke weed and I believe in the healing and eye opening power of hallucinogenics, if used responsibly. 

I suppose, in creating the post, I am trying to foster a dialogue, and explain my perspective as an outsider. I do not wish to express judgement or alienate others. I am curious and wish to know more about your experience as a human in a relationship with opiates. 

What keeps you coming back to opiates? Why have you chosen opiates as a source of pleasure and alleviation? Do you have a vision  for yourself and your life that you want but will be impossible to realize while using? 

Part of my obsession/interest in opiates is the surrender of control it seems to require of its user. Coke, speed, can offer the illusion of control, which sounds preferable to me than the wash out of blissful haze brought on by opiates. That lack of control over the direction of my life terrifies me. I  think I am so terrified over a lack of control because I have experienced depressive episodes resulting in a loss of functionality i.e. Couldn't get out of bed, obsessive destructive thinking, everything hurt. Months of this. I felt powerless, isolated, and unable to form rational, critical thought. So, yes part of my interest is out of morbid fear that I too am an addict with the potential to spiral out of control, only my addiction is to anxiety and destructive thinking. 

Long story short. We all have pain and psychic bruising that can shake us loose from our ability to cope and function. I hope we all make it. Love, strength, endurance, forgiveness, regeneration, hope. ",1503461418.0

Hopefully I'm not fucked because Subs keep me good throughout the week, if not most of the month so I can work. I like taking dope holidays, but I like the ""stability"" of my life more. Any tips on being able to do dope every once in a while and still have Suboxone be an effective addiction arresting tool that keeps my life stable? ",1503460428.0

I've seen myself as a true chipper for years using only once a week or two weeks but sometimes twice a week too. There was no set schedule but I kept my shit together. I'm still keeping my shit together but I took a step back after a busy season at work and I've used days in a row. I've had a friend shoot me up 2 or 3 times. 

I used the search bar and know it's the typical progress. I don't know what the point of this post is. I was hoping someone would say ""you're not a junkie, it's not too late to turn shit around"" but typing this out I see that's stupid. Then again, I'm also doing as well as I was when I was chipping. It hasn't gotten bad yet therefore it might not get bad at all.

Did anyone else have the moment where they realized that they might not be as in control as they thought? What do you do after that? If you don't want to stop every action seems counter intuitive.

I decided I needed a new dude, so I went over to a corner that I know is an open air market and said ""NEED 2 BUNS!"" And basically went with whoever came up to me first. These mfkers RAN to me too. Like it was a huge competition.
Anyways fast forward to now. I've been a consistent customer with him almost every single day since then. I make large purchases, and in total spend approximately $1500 a week with him. I know it's not like he gets all profit out of that, but wouldn't you say I'm quite a big customer? Lord knows I'm the biggest one he has, I have never even seen him serve someone else.
Anyways. So this dude is a total asshole. He is so mean to me it's almost laughable. Example - I'm walking towards him from the car at a quick pace and he yells ""yo hurry the FUCK up. Walk faster bitch"" and believe me, he was not joking.
I have never asked for a spot, and I've never been short aside from this one time I was a total of $4 short. My purchase was $780. I pick it up, walk back to the car, and my phone is ringing immediately. ""YOU OWE ME $4 WTF"" ""YO WTF"" doesn't even give me a chance to say anything, and starts going off about how I am ""taking food out of his baby's mouth (MA BABEYS MOUF)"".
One time he had me meet him in a different area than normal. I was confused and unfamiliar with the spot and could barely understand his directions on the phone so I ended up walking the wrong way. Oh you better believe I was cursed the fuck out for walking left 1 block when I should have walked right. 
If I complain about quality of dope, I will be verbally ripped apart.
A few times he shorted me a few bags. I called and said ""Hey I know it's not your fault and you don't bag the stuff but I just wanted to let you know I was short 4 bags out of this"". ""YOU AXED ME FOR THAT STAMP SO I GOT THAT STAMP.  I DONT PACKAGE THE SHIT. GET IT RIGHT"".

So my plan is basically find a new connect if I can next time I'm walking around the area. But I really want him to know he's driving away a huge customer. It's like he's constantly doing me a favor by selling to me. It's ridiculous!!!

Well, that didnt work out.

Soon after posting that thread, an extremely attractive prostitute friend of my dgirl hit me up looking for her. Told her what happened, and she started crying to me about how she has no one else, she's sick, blah blah blah...

So I pick her up, get her well, and we start talking. She tells me she's homeless, was relying on my dgirl alot, and has no where to go.

Thus began my spiral of her shooting me full of dope, spending all my money on dope with her, sleeping in my car with her (even though I have a room and bed), banging her, and being a general piece of shit all week.

I went from trying to quit to help my best friend out, to banging a prostitute friend of hers, and slamming dope/crystal instead of smoking it, in the span of a day or two...

I never used to shoot until she shot me up, now I'm addicted to the needle and her. I want to quit, she already gave me what I think is an abscess in my arm. But I can't. 

I'm a piece of shit. I hope there is a lesson in all this, but the only lesson I can find is that I'm not as good of a person as I thought I was.

I'm about to go pick up a gram from a middle man with the money we got from taking this prostitute to a date earlier today, then she's going to shoot me up, and we'll cuddle in my backseat watching YouTube videos all night on my phone, and I'll pretend this is normal until tomorrow. 

Anyways, just thought I'd update those whose cared, and add to the general drama and zooishness that everyone has come to expect from this sub. Happy nods ;)

I was hoping for some help regarding my partner and his opiate use. He has used roxys (snorting) on and off for the last couple of years. It got to the point where I've asked him to stop because quite frankly I have seen how snorting these pills takes over lives very quickly and easily. He promised me that he would no longer use them but of course I have my reservations. I know how physically addicting they are and just stopping cold turkey might not be as easy as it sounds. 

To be clear, I am pro-recreational drug use and dabble myself. Not in opiates but other substances. I used pills for awhile (pre-partner) but will never touch them again. No judgment to anyone that does, I've just seen so many people ruin their lives over this. 

So my question for you guys is this, what are the signs someone is using again? I know the usual, pin point eyes, itching, trouble sleeping, bursts of energy/ crashes. Is there anything else I can look for? Physical signs? etc.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",1503445005.0

i know you can't be absolutely accurate but approximate?
and then how do you taper the kratom and have NO widthdrawals when you're coming off a drug with an extremely long halflife like suboxone?


i wouldn't have asked these questions 10 years ago when i knew about kratom because i wasn't this deep. i blame it on suboxone solely as i have not taken any other drugs. the suboxone w.d. is horendous and i am really going to need a taper plan (which i do have by the way) . but i am so sick of this shit. i seriously thought that i could quit suboxone within a couple of months, and when i took my final doseage, i survived for 6-7 days . but then i had it. my body was done. i still dont feel good after that. fuck this drug. this actually makes me want to quit. if you use suboxone you need to fucking make sure that you dont use it for long term on a daily basis .


i have no idea what the fuck i've gotten myself into. this is honestly uncharted territories as there aren't that many people that stay on suboxone for this long. its really meant to get you on and get you off but a lot of people are different. i am so sad that i fcked up. it was too difficult. the physical symptoms i was feeling was worse than benzodiazepine withdrawal and withdrawal from vicoden, oxy , amphetamines, benzos etc.

this is unreal.
stick to opiates that have short half lives guys. i am sure theres some methadone horror stories out there.  god knows what we're going to find out about suboxone 10 years from now when we have fully researched this drug that has been dispensed to millions of people.


and not only that it seems like suboxone was a fucking monopoly . they had the entire fucking drug scene on lockdown because it was the most potent chemical easily accessible and available and highly advertised. some casual opiate users would take a suboxone and damn near OD . this caused them to need to actually up their (oxycodone/morphine/hydrocodone/heroin) doseages and then started doing shit like 3 oxy 80s a day (i never went this high) , my max was like 90mg of oxy a day.


this is nuts. i haven't touched oxy or any of that shit in 10+ years. only suboxone. i am very very very very infuriated that i was not informed of the long term effects of the withdrawals from suboxone  . 

tl;dr **The doctor(s) downplayed the potency of this shit like crazy.**

We currently hate each other. He bullshitted me for to long on something and by to long I mean over a month. But we had history so I tried to give him a chance when he got back on. But, he had super long wait times whereas I never waited longer than 30 minutes for him even on delivery. Then he was shorting the shit out of it. 

So, he got me. And I got him for $20. We got into a raging fight and haven't talked in almost two weeks. 

He kept getting on me that I was going elsewhere and I was like, 'asshole I'm a fucking junkie that fiends you been gone for over a month you think I wasn't getting my fix regardless?!'

He wanted to go to my best friends funeral, he told me to keep him updated. We all initially thought it was an OD for my friend so I think dude just got more protective of me because if you guys remember I said dude had a strict list of what I can buy from him so I didn't die. I begged him for fent when he accidentally gave it to us one day and he told me he wasn't going to let me end up another statistic in this horrible city. 

So, I lost my dealer of three years recently as well. ",1503420751.0

I had to be taken in Ambulance to hospital where they repaired my knee and was prescribed 10/325 white (Watson) for pain .

I came across an article that says pain pills make holes inside your stomach or intestine (something like that) I know people who really abuse pain killers and who actually have been on it a very long time, and of course there is a few who actually crush them and snort them to get high.

I plan not to ever. I only regularly smoke weed or rarely eat mushrooms. However, my mother recently got her third year sober from heroin after 10 years gripped. Both of my grandfather's OD'd, and also multiple family cousins and such. My life has definitely been touched by opiods. 


So why do I follow this sub you ask? I find all of you, and your posts, interesting and informational. 
I used to be very on the side of ""they choose to be this way"" when it came to opiods abuse, and treated my own mom very harshly. But you all have somehow shown the real everyday life of this to me and I've realized, you're all no different than myself in many aspects!


So the end to this long rant is: my mom is always telling me tales of people she sponsors in NA and I find it so gripping to learn how people got to the places they are. So, if you don't mind me asking, what led you personally into opiod dependency? How has it affected your life? And do you want to stop or to keep on with it?

Had to go to the bank to deposit cash etc, waited for 40 mins outside people watching.

A man, about 6""2, with a really tattered right shoe and practically half of a left one was walking back and forth. His hairnets patchy, and his head and face were deeply scarred. He had probably taken quite a few beatings and may have been tortured. I thought he was asking people for money.  I was in a horrid mood so I was only glancing, I would've lost the temper if he had.propisitionsd me.

I always get asked for money in the city, it's actually a bit of a joke.  There's this one romanian dude who always asks me.
One of the last times I saw him I ripped off the scarf covering my face and told him to remember my face cause if he didn't I would get angry

""Sorry boss"" he said as he shuffled away.

Anyway, this guy with the shoes ended up walking into the the bank, he was talking to the teller next to me.

He had 4 accounts; a current account, a savings account, some sort of pension and a fucking investors account.
He spoke with an English accent and made awkward small talk whilst reciting all the necessary information needed to make the transaction go quick as possible.

This tattered man was a junkie. He withdrew 500 as it was his daily limit. I figure he probably came in at least a few days a week.

I was really tempted to follow him, converse and maybe spend an hour or two with him. But I bought a honey chilli chicken roll from a shop manned by 4-5 old woman whom I'm always really nice to whenever I visit and each time that £2.50 gets fucking heavier.


Actual cold copping story

Walking through the same city, some guy asks if I smoke weed as the crowd parts and we make eye contact
 I wasn't busy and was smoking  7 grams a day at this point so a new connect was always nice.

Hours later we head to his as we had spent some time drinking/gambling.
He stayed with his mother and her partner. The partner was in the kitchen ""making"" soup for the duration of the stay. At one 0oint ingot up from my seat to stir the soup as it was unnattend. It was fucking burnt.

Anyway, this guy puts an ounce of bud on the table in front of me and disappears for 20 minutes. Then comes back and declares that was a test and proceeds to weigh it. He was proud of me for passing the test. He then grabs nunchakus and demonstrates.

Ive been on vivitrol from November up until last month when I took the final shot. Didn't want to be on it, it was the last resort and it was either that or I'd be homeless. Overall, I'm grateful to have been on it bc it physically kept me away from the horrible heroin binge cycle that I've been back and forth with for years. But it didn't do anything for cravings even though that's what everyone assumed it did which was frustrating I couldn't convince them. My definition of cravings personally is I think, but I can't prove it, that my brain has been lacking the normal production of certain neurotransmitters all my life which led to a horrible depression that kicked off when I was 12/13, and opiates make my brain literally feel normal and gives it what it naturally lacks. It could be endorphins, dopamine, serotonin... i don't know. But the only drug (other than cigarettes and caffeine) I've ever been addicted to are opiates, bar none. I've never ever wanted anything else as badly where I would let my morals fall one by one, it's fucking incredible what it can turn me into. 

So I felt like I've been on the vivitrol long enough. It can actually damage your liver from long term use, which is ironic bc the drugs its supposed to block causes very minimal problems physically. It's the lifestyle and lack of money/pure unadulterated source that kills you in the end. So i made the decision for myself to go to the sub doctor about 30 days ago, even though I had just gotten that months shot four days before. I didn't tell the doctor that though. I've been able to successfully use subs to break through the naltrexone by IVing them, so I knew it would work. I just couldn't fucking handle the side effects anymore, mostly depression, insomnia, and stomachs cramps, not to mention I have no idea the repercussions of blocking your body's own endorphins. I've been on vyvanse that's prescribed for about as long as I've been on the vivitrol. Thank fucking god, vyvanse has helped me through this and it's done amazing things for me. I have so much confidence and self esteem which I've never had before, I can talk to anyone and just completely be myself and say what's really on my mind which has led to amazing conversations. I have a shit ton more empathy skills, and the focus and mental speed it gives me to write and play music has gotten me to a point where I have so much pride in myself. 


So my shot should be very close to being completely out of my body, it's hard to say how much is still active. I've tried to get high when I was five days overdue for my next dose and didn't feel anything at all. But the suboxone has been working very well despite that and the synergy with the vyvanse has seriously helped me become the person that I've always dreamed of being. Smart, confident, brave, compassionate, responsible, and loving towards others and myself. I'm on 2 8mg strips a day and 100mg of vyvanse. I do have to admit that there are people that love to shit talk, which brings me to my questions. 

People that are very close to my life, like my mom or brother for example, are wary about me being on these medicines. A few people have accused me of scamming the doctor to prescribe these drugs to a drug addict and all I'm doing is getting high. Everybody that has said stuff like that don't actually know anything about subs or vyvanse, they just immediately equate it to methadone and speed. The ones who have said the most shit are actually addicted to their own things but they are considered ""functional"" even though for every night the pass two years they get drunk on vodka or they're in a shitty terrible relationship where they are obviously getting high on that persons abuse.

The post was supposed to be just me unloading struggles with being autistic and addicted to opiates at the same time, but I'm terrible at expressing myself, so it came out sounding like I'm in denial I think.  I'm very addicted.  I'm well aware of this.

So I'm fucked. Well and truly fucked. Hilariously fucked.

Hence the throwaway name.

I thought I'd never have this issue. You see, I'm autistic. I tried oxycodone for the first time when I was in the 10th grade, after enjoying the afterglow of my wisdom teeth surgery so much. So warm, so relaxed. All of the sensory shit just sort of calms down. I feel like I can talk to people for once. No panic attacks, no meltdowns, no hitting myself in the head, nothing. All of the noise in my head just melts away. And there's a lot of fucking noise in my head. I wouldn't say it makes me feel like a normal person because I'm also, well, high when I'm high.

Anyways, I never figured this would happen to me. I can barely get myself to manage a few lines of conversation with people I don't know, and that's difficult. I'd never be able to find a dealer. I'd never go out of my way to meet a shady stranger. That's fucking terrifying for me. Nope, no thank you. Besides, I wouldn't even know where to start looking. This is where the logic goes wrong. You don't need a dealer anymore, you just need a way to buy online, of which there are plenty. So the moment my mental health took a turn for the (even) worse a year and a half ago and I started experiencing severe depression, worsening panic attacks, and a resurgence of self-injurious behavior that I hadn't seen in years, a bit of morphine to make it all go away just sounded fantastic. I was so bad off that I literally told myself ""I'm going to take this every day"" from the very beginning.

I'm a fucking idiot. That's not news to me, but Jesus fuck, I'm an idiot.

So that brings me to withdrawals. And that sensory shit I mentioned earlier. Pain makes me panic in general. Any negative feeling in the body is prone to giving me panic attacks. Slightly racing heart? Panic. Nausea? Panic. Too cold? Panic. Too hot? Panic. You get the idea. Every single thing on the list of opiate withdrawal symptoms makes me panic, which makes me either have a panic attack or a self-abusive meltdown.

I managed to get three weeks in once, but it just never got better. Not once. It actually just seemed to get worse every day. Kratom helps, but when I stop the kratom, it's all over.

I just really can't stand it anymore. Autism also means that I'm deeply entrenched in ritual and routine. Even if the opiates completely stopped working for me and there was no chance of withdrawals, I'd still wash seeds every day. It's just what I do now. When I try to quit, I perseverate on it. I spend hours walking around in circles thinking about how I should buy more, but I need to stop, but I should buy more, but I need to stop, but I should buy more, but I need to stop but I should buy more, but I need to stop, but.......... For hours. Or if I'm sitting on my couch I'll do the same while I stare at the ceiling.

I'm aware that you guys can't help and that I need professional help. Pretty plain for me to see. But part three of the autism triumvirate of disability is that I have trouble expressing myself verbally. This includes to a psychiatrist. I don't know how to bring this up. I obviously wasn't supposed to get into this, I don't know how they'll react and I don't want them to share this with my parents. At this point suicide is my strongest consideration, although I really don't want to hurt my family that way. So I just sort of think about it.

I'm sure this is riddled with errors. I'm nodding a little bit, and I'm also having trouble expressing myself/recalling words at the moment.

Just thought I'd share so that you could all read and think ""well fuck, at least I'm not that guy.""

EDIT: Edited out some information about route of administration, so if it's confusing, sorry.

EDIT 2: I can't even reach out for help without fucking everything up.  Pretty sure at this point that I just need to go ahead and kill myself.",1503645385.0

While I normally just orally take them, I got some roxys and snorted some. It's been years. My boyfriend just banged my old DOC that I banged for 2 years 10ish years ago (I'm rx'd syringes for my injectable meds). And in the process lets me know he has never shot himself up and may need my help. I refrained from shooting up, but the whole process kinda killed whatever I had going. 

Fuck. I know I'm fucking stupid for even putting myself in this situation. We both used when we were younger and got clean. (We didn't know each other during this time.) I was on my meds for 2 years taking them as prescribed, but I slipped the last couple months when I had to switch doctors and got stronger meds and more of them because I could actually get to a level where my pain was low, and I was buzzed enough to not care about the pain left. My meds just got switched and dropped lower because my pm unexpectantly quit 2 weeks ago. I know that I was using my pain as an excuse to abuse them. 

I don't want to go back to IVing and having to supplement my RXs. I tried going without narcotics for my chronic pain for years and struck out, which led me to pain management. It was so bad it affected my job, social life, and made my depression much worse. I couldn't participate in life. I did so well when I was rx'd them again, until recently. Tomorrow I will be taking them as prescribed, even if my pain is higher because it's a helluva lot better than being compeltely out and withdrawling. 

How did you feel when you were confronted with your old habit? Did you partake? I know he feels great, and I vividly remember what it feels like. But it destroyed my life, so I can't. I just hope I can hold on to that idea. 

I know this is an annoying rant, but I needed to get it out, and since I was sober for so long, many of my new friends don't know about my past. I also moved across the country.

A couple days ago I went to check the mail and to my surprise there were three blister packs of oc 10's and one blister pack of oc 40's. Fuckkk. Pop two 40's before I even get the rest of the mail. Realize I fucked up but it's too late so I just walked home and nodded the fuck out watching some Rick and Morty. Great ass night. 

That was 5 days ago. I have a probation drug test tomorrow and I just tested myself and I'm clean. So I'm ok. But now I'm sitting on a fuck ton of oxy so I've been trying to keep busy and I've kept them in my hiding spot because I know if I look at them I'm gonna take em. 

But also, there is a possibility that I may get off probation early so my clean time will be cut much shorter which is good and bad. I don't want to get clean yet. It's very frustrating to be told what to do. 

Anyways, I'm doin ok. Hope you all are well. Keep ya head up as much as physically possible and stay safe out there fam. Out.",1503636518.0

* (Anti-Diarrhea)  Loperamide from Dollar General (72 ct).  
* One-a-Day Multivitamins  
* Sleep Aid (Melatonin) from Dollar General  
* Fruit (avoid bananas),  
* Sports Drinks.  
* Energy Drinks or 5 hour energy  
* Goody/BC Powders.  
  
**PROCESS**  
* Take 4-6 mgs of Loperamide before going into our during minor withdrawals at night along with the 2 tablets of the sleep aid.  
* When you wake up, take another 2-4 mgs of Loperamide.  
* Take a multivitamin.  
* Eat your fruit, take a Goody Powder, and drink your sports drink.  
* If you're still having diarrhea, take 2mgs of Loperamide.  
* Drink your 5 Hour Energy or Energy drink.  
* Work (manual labor is best). If you do not work in manual   labor; exercise or do something physical.  
* Take an ibuprofen/Tylenol (dependent on which goody/bc powder you took earlier) for example, if it contained Acetaminophen then take Ibuprofen and vice versa.  
* Take 1mg of Loperamide (make sure at this intake, you're next Loperamide intake is in about 4+ hours [step 1).  
* Repeat steps 1 - 9 for the next day while adjusting Loperamide and Melatonin intake (For myself, I bump up 2-4 mgs of Loperamide for the steps that involved it and i also bump up the melatonin intake).  
  
**NOTES**  
* the sleep aid can be replaced by benzodiazepines such as Xanax (Alprazolam), Klonopin (Clonazepam) etc.  
* if you can find Loperamide (Immodium AD), Pepto will work but not as well.  
  
This has definitely worked well for me, and you'll probably have to adjust the mg intake for Loperamide and Melatonin Bard on your habit.  
  
Increase the mg intake on Loperamide and Melatonin for each day off withdrawals.   

On the fourth day, do not take Loperamide in the morning and have a bowel movement. If it still feels/looks like diarrhea then continue talking Loperamide, but if it's somewhat normal just monitor it.

6vvqoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6vvqoz/my_opiate_addiction_started_because_of_oxycodone/,16,https://redd.it/6vvqoz,Daveslaine,My opiate addiction started because of oxycodone,"I've been doing opiates for 7 years starting with tramadol but I'd rarely do it and take years off.

Last year I started doing hydrocodone to compliment some of the greatest and most awesome moments of my life. Basically if something amazing was planned that day id take it to boost the day ten fold.

I'd always get lucky in that since I'd do it every once in a while id always find a friend or a family member with a script that they didn't need and they gave it to me or sold it..

Once my family friend last September 30 got oxycodone... And I hadn't done oxy for 1 year 2 months at that point, my hydro use turned to oxy and then oxy turned to snorting, and blues, and soon I found myself doing 120mg and it felt like nothing.

I cold turkeyd starting Wednesday and it's pretty bad but I'm strong and getting through it..

My point is, oxycodone is FAR FAR worse than hydrocodone. Hydrocodone was always a light high that brought you up slowly and gently brought you down. Oxy is different. Takes you out like a rocket and when your done you come crashing down in flames and breaking into pieces.

I need a tolerance break and I love opiates I'm not saying im gonna stop all my life, but there's a major difference doing 30-40mg hydro max twice in the weekends in the morning versus oxy daily day and night. Oxycodone also feels like shit honestly and doesn't have the warmth and the light hydrocodone has at all and hydrocodone has almost no withdrawal at least it's nothing compared to oxy withdrawals. 

Fuk oxy.  And i just got 2,020 milligrams coming in. I'm just gonna store it.. Let a family member hide it. It's not worth it to me it's way too addictive and damaging

Edit: I also have ASMR which is a condition that oxycodone completely shuts down. ASMR basically causes your body to flood itself with endorphins whenever it's triggered by something such as music or anything and this helps me get up in the day or just live in general. Hydrocodone did slow my ASMR down but mildly whereas oxy completely shuts it down. Thankfully just 2 days without it and it's coming back a little. Everytime I feel the rush of my ASMR a minute later I feel a little sedated and noddy which is great but not enough yet to overpower the crappy feeling of withdrawal",1503628545.0

My family is large and gossipy. It's easily my least favourite thing about them and part of why I moved away. When I was young I was really close with my cousin and while we're not as close we still have a great rapport. Enjoy seeing each other at family functions, occasionally check in with each other on Facebook, etc. 

My mom heard from my aunt (my cousin's mom) that my cousin is using heroin. My mom told me a bunch of stories (""she's hep c positive and her galbladder is diseased but they can't remove it bc of her liver!,"" ""she was found slumped over the wheel of her car and now has a court date,"" ""she OD'd 3 separate times and now she's fined anytime they have to use Narcan on her""). My mom and my aunt are both pretty gossipy and dramatic. However, in many of my cousin's Facebook pictures there are obvious track marks. She openly talks about other drugs on her Facebook and she's often trying to sell her things there as well. She's never shared with me whether or not she uses any kind of drugs (except marijuana - she knows I smoke), so really who knows. 

So my dilemma: I immigrated to a country where I can walk into any pharmacy and receive Narcan for free, no prescription, no questions asked. I also have access to a surplus of syringes through other public welfare programs. I'm scared for my cousin. My mom and my aunt can both exaggerate but the story about her overdoses continues to stick with me. I worry that if I approach my cousin and offer these things she will decline them to hide the fact that she uses because she won't want that to get back to her mom & other family because she's also aware of how gossipy everyone is. I have no intention to discuss this with my mother or any other family members, but she has no reason to believe that.

My question for you guys: how do I approach this? Do I ask for her address and just mail them to her, without discussing it? Do I give them to her in person, again without discussing it? Do I try to talk to her about it? 

Additionally, since I'm in another country, the package would be subjected to inspection by the United States Border Services. Is it illegal to mail these things or receive them in the mail? Obviously I don't want to get her in any kind of trouble. 

Tldr: Suspect cousin uses heroin, want to give her Narcan & clean syringes, don't want her to decline them so that she can hide it - how do I approach this?

Thanks guys!",1503623371.0

i have been prescribed on average 100 adderall, 50-100 opioids (bupe), 120 gabapentin, and then every so often i will get 50 ambien or lunesta every month for sleep.  and that is all coming from my sub dr/psychiatrist.

when i would doctor shop i had Drs convinced i needed so many benzos - i was getting 160 bars and 120 valium every month just to treat my anxiety.  then i would get Z-drugs for sleeping like lunesta or ambien.  then i would complain and ask to try a different benzo and i would get another 120 benzos on top of the previous script i was trying to ""switch"".  

then came my bread and butter - i had a doctors office where every doctor EVERY MONTH would prescribe me 8oz of Tussionex.  i would smoke three unfiltered marlboro reds on the way to the Dr to inflame my throat and i would just sit in the lobby for 20 minutes fake coughing as loud as i possibly could.  like it was obnxiously loud - they always would comment on how sorry they felt for me.

I would always tell the Dr that I needed something more powerful than Delsym to help me sleep and not have the cough at nighttime especially.  i would always say ""whatever syrupy stuff you gave me last time did the trick""  because for a while they tried to script me Benzonatate pearls fuck those things.

It started as codeine/prometh syrup and randomly cheratussin but then it was only tussionex he would script me.  I did this every month for almost 2 years and they always scripted it to me because back then on my parents badass insurance i could afford it - 8oz tussionex for $4!!!  

oh and by the way, it gets even more ridiculous - eventually I just started straight up asking for the ""pill version of the syrup stuff"" AND I HAD TRAINED THIS OFFICE TO SCRIPT ME 50-100 COUNT SCRIPTS OF VICODIN FOR THE FAKE COUGH.  straight up horse pills.  by the way, this was the doctor that wrote my benzos so I would walk out of here with a script for 100vikes/8oz tussionex, 160 bars, and 120 valium - ALL FOR $12.  pharmacist mustve been going crazy every time he saw me every month grinning ear to ear

Damn. Well, I'm not doing that again, purely because it felt so good. The rush of all three combined was unreal. It's been like an hour, and even though the coke has worn off by this point, it still feels a lot stronger than a normal goofball. No idea why that's happening. 

I just went and smoked some weed, and it kicked me almost back to the initial rush. Over an hour later. I've tried a shit ton of drugs, and a lot of drug combos, and I can safely say that this takes the cake. 

All that said, I wouldn't try this if I were you. First of all, it was a very irresponsible thing for me to do, and just cause my heart's still beating, doesn't mean yours will be. 

Even more concerning though, is the want to redose. I'm very lucky, in that I don't really get the urge to redose with almost any drug. Even after speed/goofballs of much higher doseage than this. But this changed that. I'm lucky that I used my last needle, otherwise I could see easily chasing this until I run out.

But only within the past year have these dreams become terrifying nightmares..and they arnt even scary in the normal sense, just terrifying because i cant wake up..

 When i do too many opiates i have the most vivid lucid dreams. I can control everything about my dream, but instead of waking up because i know im dreaming..i dont.

 I always start in bed where im aware my body is sleeping. I try to scream first, and because i cant make a sound thats how i know im  dreaming. I end up trying to wake myself up other ways. I climb up tall buildings i manifest and jump off them hoping that when i hit thd ground id wake up, but i dont. I do tons of shit like that, trying to hurt myself so bad itll make me wake up. Just now i tried to masturbate in my dream cause i thought if i was stuck there i might as well enjoy it lol. But for real, I legit panic everytime that i ODd in my sleep or something, but that im dead and stuck in this lucid dream state for eternity.

Fuck. Im really scared to go to bed but i need sleep. If anyone has any tips besides ..dont do opiates ..id be greatful for any ideas or suggestions. Thanks for reading. Peace be with yall ;)

so i'm not at the point where i'm using every single day (aside from long-term sub maintenance) but where i'm at mentally is equivalent to if i were still doing a few buns a day. :l 

that is obviously my own fault; my fucked up doing... it is mostly because of my mind state when i'm not high. for example, when i am not high, i'm figuring out when i will be next, and daydreaming about it until it's time to cop again...

I'm honestly at that standstill that occurs when you just get so fucking stagnant in your life that it's like you're perpetually stuck, deep in a pit. but it isn't one that you've stumbled upon and fallen into on a merry ol stroll through the woods, no... it's one that you've knowingly dug for yourself, and hopped the fuck into on your own.. 


and due to the stagnant nature of your current existence, all you can ever do now is miserably reside there in that pit. almost like you're living inside a fucking grave; simply sitting in the dirt, with nothing but a needle and a spoon, or a card and a straw.

surrounded by lies and your own broken promises, empty glassine bags scattered across the ground ... as well as a decade worth of regret and shattered hopes and dreams reminding you of all that you've thrown away.

at this point, all you're capable of doing is sitting there wondering if you even care enough to try and claw your way out... or more importantly, the daily internal debate if you even *want* to come out. sometimes it seems easier just to stay put...

it takes its fucking toll on you; pondering if you can convince yourself that you're strong enough to relearn how to coexist with the normies in this fucked up world. attempting to live a normal life, after becoming addicted to one of the most pleasurable drugs this planet has to offer, is one of the biggest struggles i have encountered in my life. how the fuck do you tell yourself you'll be okay without the warmth of the lover you've had an affair with for a decade plus?

Lets just talk about some things, what we could try to do ,what you think should happen, and what you think will occur in the near future regarding the laws on drugs that obviously don't work .

Here we go:I think you can learn a lot about a person via their drug stash photo
And seeing the ones with the Prometh/Codeine remind me of when i was like 12-15 . i would get 1 liter bottles. (not joking) . unfortunately, i dont know exactly what happened, but someone (literally) tried to steal my script & it was game over.
i believe it was one of the pharmacists phoned in to my doctor under my name pretending they were my mother. 
 :| :| .
dude was VERY liberal with giving me codeine and hydrocodone cough syrup. refills galore. i think what happened was that they saw that i had just been prescribed a 1 liter codeine and then a 1000ml  hydrocodone bottle.. then one day he was just like ""after this ican't prescribe you anymore because DEA ..""
back then, i was all about being a syrup sipping nigga.


back when darvocet might have maybe even tickled my pickle. (lol, probably not since i was 12)



but i still dont get why ANYONE would pay $200 - $500 for a bottle of codeine . 
i don't even know who the fuck can afford that.. do they not understand that 400mg of codeine is not much drugs at all? (and that only 400mg of codeine every 4 hours can be processed into morphine less you want to incur a histamine release reaction.)


idk i feel like some of these kids that were able to get access to xanny bars thru the net are now graduating to codeine, so the next generation is going to be super fucked up worse than us . kids are copping on snapchat, and the dealers know that they are underage. some of the dealers (very brazen) are selling to other kids and them, themselves being kids. thats a whole new ballgame. when i was a kid (wasn't that long ago lmao) , 
we didn't have a silk road, we didn't have real online plugs (there were some iops but nobody really had patience for that lol) .
now people openly and brazenly sell shit wide open on the web like its nothing.. 

UK's next generation is being hit hard right now by MDMA & Xanax . and of course they've always had otc dhc. Probably the reason why they are more drawn towards the mdma and xans online (as thats what the feature of the show was)




heroin isn't even going to be cool anymore in 10 years.. we're just gonna be like wheres that new time release oxy-fentanyl dual action capsules?! ?

heh


or maybe they'll send us back 10 years and force us to take some fucked up version of darvocet lmao .

maybe they'll realize that the whole war on drugs was futile and stop producing opiates  , and start selling poppies in the store cause' you know, more natural. lol.

something has to be altered drastically

i believe that by making most of these drugs illegal you are drawing people towards them. where as if they were legal and supervised, 
you probably wouldn't hear about that kid in school being like ""yo i just got high on my parents Tylenol #6 (the new tylenol with heroin)"" or tylenol #7 , Tylenol & Buprenorphine. (for those of you whom need to quit that heavy tylenol #6 addiction after moving on from tylenol #5 .)

note that we do have hydromotrin in stock, 200mg of motrin, and 200mg of hydrocodone , 200-hour tablets.

Note: in the year 2077 we have limited the daily dose of acetaminophen to 1mg per pill, as we have found that Marijuana works much better. 

But if you want that pure heroin, you'll need to ask the pharmacist . Because you need to provide ID that you're 21 & up . 


IMO, and this is not satire, Alcohol is JUST AS HARMFUL as heroin if not more harmful (except for the fact that with heroin you can overdose with a smaller amount. but they are now making powdered alcohol so that is changing as well..). Just people are more used to seeing what/how people drink therefore are indoctrinated into drinking cultures at a young age.

So its perception.


IMO Alcohol should be fucking illegal. That stuff will actually kill you from the withdrawals. IMO the only problem with opiates being legal would be doseage factor. but i guess thats why you could dispense at the most minimum doseages with no tylenol or motrin . 



and at the end of this i am realizing again that the reason that it is really illegal is to keep both the legal and illegal trade of opiates high$ . But if that trade of opiates wasn't high, and americans weren't using so many opiates - maybe that money could be put towards more beneficial usages?


Also just to keep people informed we give everyone , 1 narcan with their tylenol #7 .

So a while back I told the tale of Van the degenerate sheisty thieving meth-head alcoholic hoarder hobo and some ppl wanted pictures of him and his camp. Well I just went to his camp looking for him (creepy af in the dark) and he wasn't there but I snapped a few pics of his camp. 

I met him when I was a heroin addicted street punk. He's an awful human being. He creeps into ppls house and garages at night high on meth and steals. Like some kind of bogeyman. He doesn't even care what he steals. Boxes of dishes wrapped in newspaper, children's toys/stuffed animals (he has waaay too many of these and has a few he sleeps with religiously), bikes and all sorts of other stuff he has no use for. Fucker has like 8 mops and no floor. He stole this shed thing piece by piece and made a little shack from it. One time he came up with everything out of a landscaping company's truck except the lawnmower. Leaf blower, hedge trimmers, 2 nice weed whackers and more. All nice quality. He told me a long story of how he found them in a dumpster and the guy who put them there said he'd won the lottery and never had to do his own yard work again lmao. 
 I have long standing beef with van bc one time when he knew I had money he tried to go in my pockets once he thought I'd been nodded out long enough. He's also beat up several of the junky homeless females in meth rages but won't fight a dude unless they're really young and small. He and another guy beat my young small friend up and stole his book bag and then got him arrested by calling the cops and lying to them. Didn't help that my friend was crazy drunk. Vans also tried to steal a ton of shit from me when I was homeless both unsuccessfully and successfully. In the short time I was just there I saw several things he'd stolen from me. I might go back and loot that fuckers camp I hate him so much. I'll try to resist for karmas sake. The drunk fucker came at me with a knife once. I sidekicked his old ass in the ribs and broke one or two. Felt kinda bad about it but fuck him he picks on ppl weaker than himself and only had the balls to attack me bc the liquor and the knife. Fuck him. 

I'll edit in more pictures. I'll try to get one of him but I assume he's in jail since he's not at the store panhandling and he's not guarding his camp.

I really need a room like this but A) it's a dealing house and B) everyone's always fucked up but C) the guys gf has a 20 yro daughter that's hot as fuck and has been hitting on me hard today and yesterday. She's super hot so I could be hitting that and doing fine fine dope. I kinda know it's a bad idea bc I've been doing good keeping my habit low but . . . . fire dope and fine pussy. Hard decision. Also the neighbors 5 houses up sell good coke. The ppl that want me to move in have sold here for like 5+ years but that doesn't mean they can't or won't get raided tomorrow. 

It's probably a bad idea but holy fuck would it be a fantastic time. I'm probably gonna do it lol. 

Just had to wait an hour for my sack bc dudes nodding hard tho. I was pissed right up until he handed me my shit haha. 

Fantastic A1 dope and a fine ass 20 yro chick wanting me and good coke right up the street. What would y'all do? There's a good chance by next Wednesday I'll be living here banging speedballs and her daughter even tho I know it'd undo the progress I've made. 


Edit: the mom just took me aside and showed me a bunch of pics of her daughter to show how pretty she is. Some at the beach in a bikini.

I've noticed this a few times after shooting up, every time it's been if I'm shooting into my hands. Directly after the hit, the skin around the area gets really blotchy and swollen - akin to a miss, but not centralized and a lot more spread out, and usually around the injection site rather than on it. I also get a hit and a rush, so I know it's not a miss. It's usually gone fifteen minutes later, but I'm curious as to what it is.

A friend told me that it's a vein rupturing, but I take what he says with a pinch of salt. He's also told me acid stays in your spine for seven years, that you can bring someone out of a heroin O.D. with a shot of cocaine and that he's personally cooked crystal meth out of methadone, so I usually seek a second opinion before I take his word for anything. Has anyone else experienced this?

Fast forward to last night when I got extremely sick with what I thought was cotton fever you know I was shivering too everything felt like shit it went away by the morning after I fell asleep. then this morning picked up again same metal aftertaste and I got sick but only for about two hours I napped woke up it was gone. Just hit him again and I was like man what are you cutting that with like I was like I don't care because you're telling me but tell me what it is and quit using it he's like oh you're allergic to iron? I was like no man but I don't think you can fucking IV iron he was like oh well ran out of dormant which is normally what are uses used it for years no problems but fucking iron are you kidding me you can't do shit like yat for real. 

His logic was. Well I'm out of dormant. Pills is white. It'll work. WHAT AM I DOING TO MY BODY. Can you iv this shit. I am so fed up. I took kratom last night bc I said enough is a fuckin nough and it actually helped a lot I didn't wake up in withdraw a barely used but of course today company is coming and I'm forced to pick up because we all know that excuse. have to be well to function. entertain people clean the fucking house.

Does your body reject ived METAL!!! I'm sure it does. Why Am I even asking this. Bc I'm a junkie and trying to convince myself this bag I just picked up while he admitted to using iron won't make me sick. No return policy on dope. ""Oh no don't like that cut. Try again buddy"" ....",1503701504.0

Like I literally went in one month, everything is fine, same doc for years, I go back the next month-I don't exist! There was something that happened somewhere and I wasn't in the damn computers! All they had was my recent paper records! DAV is working on it and they've been getting me some stuff but this has been a bloody absolute nightmare and shocking that this could happen. I swear I'm a fucking pariah or something sometimes. anyways I'm waiting for approval for a pain pump it's been 3 months and everything is an uphill battle right now, pharmacy has my recent records but i'm not in the computer to refill monthly or even get the damn meds that way so the doc has to have a nurse hand walk a script down everytime and they don't even have paper there so it was another obstacle. I've been eating almost 200 loperamide a day as a poor mans substitute because they cut me down so much during the wait while the VA gets its head out of its ass to get me what I need and I legit need pain management (More surgeries than I can count, shrap to my guts, missing most of colon, a part of my stomach, hand took a round they rebuilt that though pretty easily and didn't lose functionality but it aches like hell nowadays and a few years later went back for more like a fucking idiot and decided that it was fun the first time so lets get severely injured again in my guts I guess), Back when I was younger, I wanna say this was like...ohh..2009ish, I'd order the poppy pods online, tea them up, dry the tea out on a glass pan with a fan in a cabinet, then just eat the dried up crud which wasn't that bad and provided great pain relief, although I was partially using that for just recreational if I'm honest..,..
But now with my tolerances sky freaking high, no pain meds, constant agony, a dependence on heavy opiates and the withdrawal not being something I wanna do I wanna make some more pod tea like I did before....But I can't for one find a reliable source of strong pods, I ordered some online but when i made tea it seemed weak compared to before and a lot more of a limited supply now and they look small.
 Is it just my luck that nowadays online they're all junk to buy? Can someone with experience message me maybe? Or is this a result of a super tolerance like mine derived from having so little colon and stomach and years of use of the heavy prescription stuff? I gotta do this asap and money is as tight as it bloody well gets but I'm about sick and tired of being miserable. I've got a few years left to live here and would like to live them not lying in bed wishing I was dead.(Hope this isn't against the rules here but I really do need some help here, I'm not getting freaking payed either right now so money is tight and I can't afford to experiment buying pods all over the internet right now). And is it still legal to buy pods for cough ornamental purposes cough?  With my extreme tolerances will it even be an effective pain relief source? I'm looking at least a month or 2 from having this bullshit figured out and them installing that pump in me and I've been pretty much bed ridden most of the time. I'm constantly on the edge of withdrawal, I've been hospitalized like 3 times since then and actually had to get bloody shitty medi-cal obama care medical for free which is even worse than the damn VA. Those bastards couldn't even prescribe me pain meds lol. They couldn't even figure out how to refer me to a pain management specialist! Total disaster. Also laundum is made with drinking alcohol correct? If I made it out of pods would I get drunk or is it just small amounts you're drinking?

6w1ppl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6w1ppl/just_say_no/,17,https://redd.it/6w1ppl,sloan_fitch,Just say no.,"Did a favor for a friend. It was pay day, he was out of dope and I wanted some so I had him order it and I split the order down the middle with him. He'll pay me back on script day which happens in a couple of days. I knew he would run out of dope before me due to his higher tolerance, but we started with an equal amount. 

TLDR paragraph is at the very bottom. 

The plan was to have subs by the time we both ran out. Of course, this is the one time the sub connect is out of town. Then there's a backup sub connect but they wouldn't deliver just two. We'd be able to buy more than two subs but we hastily made a decision to share order bun when the middle told us he couldn't get subs the other night. In retrospect, having an extra few bucks would've allowed us to get subs delivered. Too late for that now. I was pretty vocal about being pissed about being made to make the decision in haste. 

&nbsp;

I proposed having me go to the sub connect to pick up since delivery is not an option. It seems to be at least possible but nothing 100% confirmed or planned. 

**Today I woke up to a message from my friend,** ""I'm empty and feel like death. F me. How are you? Do you have a bump or something to spare?""

Of course my first concern was whether his alternate ""friend""/sub connect responded and inquiring about going through the shittier overpriced sub connect. To which my friend says, ""I'm trying everything, waiting for responses and the overpriced guy is not an option bc we don't meet the minimum order.""

He said that his alternate friend doesn't mind if I drive over later but that it ""might be tonight. late."" Logically I state back to him, ""It would be awesome if we could definitely pre arrange for that option."" I'm not trying to go to work sick even if it's mild WD. 

At this point I didn't tell my friend whether or not I could spare a bump or not. I'm just waking up and am certainly not doing anything to screw myself. My friend goes on to state in text, ""I'm on the phone now. We can get them tonight around 9 or 10pm.""(the subs) -- ""Most likely you (me) will have to get them. Less likely they'll get delivered.""

""But we will definitely get them for the weekend. today is the hard part.""

""Is there a way you can help me out?"", he asks again. Oh yeah, I forgot, I still didn't tell him yes or no either way but only indicated that I'm probably out or down to residue on the bag. He even texted, ""I'd even walk to you, I'm in hell.""

So I respond, ""I was hoping to have subs yesterday.""
He says, ""yeah, thats tru."" Then, ""Anything ?"", ""This is tortuere"", ""Of course I'll give you a lil extra on monday"" [if I help him out].. Then I finally indicated that I'm all out, that I have nothing and that I had to pick the lining of a virtually empty bag with my straw. So then he goes, ""so is that a yes?"" .....ugh, I'll restate, finally. I explain, ""I'm clean out, just consumed the residue."" -- Just a note. Yes I'm lying. I have a fucking bump left, I'm not down to an empty bag with residue just yet, but almost.

Of course he responded one word, ""fuck"". To this I understand his position and I respond, ""yeah, tomorrow is gonna be even worse because I have to work."" My friend states, ""we should have subs by then."" Still not definite!!! See, this is why I didn't want to share the last of my dope. The operant word, ""should"" is not ""will"" nor is it remotely a variation upon, ""definitely will.""

&nbsp; 

Regarding 9 or 10pm tonight, I ask if that was likely. He says, ""I believe so idk how I'm gonna make it til then."" 

&nbsp;

So yeah, I fucking lied about having nothing left. Last time he was willing to walk to my house in the afternoon was funny. Funny in retrospect, at the time it really sucked for me. We both had no dope or money. I just got paid $40 so I text him, ""does $40 help?"" Surprisingly, it does and more surprisingly he texts, ""I'll be right there."" He shows up at my door in uncharacteristically record time. Tells me that he's got a friend getting it and that he'd have something for me before I go to work.

Well, what happened that time was two things. A false story and a reality. Well, the falsehood didn't happen but it was stated by him as follows:  His friend came by to deliver two bags of dope and allegedly said that he'd come back later after he re-upped. I received enough dope to feel well before and during work. Felt okay after work as well. My friend who has a higher tolerance and higher cravings for dope also looked fine after work. Spent the whole weekend waiting for his friend to deliver what was owed and got nothing. My friend even pretended to read a text message he sent off of his phone. Something like this, where he pleaded with his friend, ""If you can't get the rest of the dope just let me know, I know how it is if you ran out and can't get more."" I spent two nights that weekend waiting for his friend to come through and deliver what was allegedly owed. I offered to go to that person's house to pick up but he allegedly had to wait for his fucking wife to go sleep. Then as the late hours of the night transpired, it became obvious there would be no relief in sight on those evenings.

&nbsp;

The reality is simple. That particular time he took my $40, got faded, gave me table scraps then dished out false hope for nearly a week. Hell, I got through the worst of the symptoms by the time the week was over but the principle of what went wrong lingered. **I learned a lesson that time.**

&nbsp;

**The lesson I learned a couple of months ago is the reason that I lied to my friend today and chose not to give him ""even a bump"". What's the point? What if he doesn't get subs this weekend? I rather have that much more dope in my blood stream, and would rather have the option to save a bump or two of dope for tomorrow. Right now I have the power to make sure that I don't go to work dope sick tomorrow. If I share what I have left now, and my friend fails to get subs then I'm fucked. 

The text messages I received earlier may have only been as optimistic as they were about getting subs because if they weren't that would be all the more reason for me not to share what I have left. 

So if my friend doesn't get subs and fails to follow through which is a very good possibility--what is the point? I lose the last of my dope so that he can feel well for a few more hours, maybe for the rest of today. Then we'd both feel shitty tomorrow but I would still have to go to work as well. Whereas right now, I have  a chance to not feel shitty tomorrow.

&nbsp;

TL;DR:

Friend is having trouble getting subs on time and asked me if I could spare him ""even a bump"" of dope. I lied, told him I had nothing so that I don't get screwed and end up going to work feeling like shit this weekend. ",1503698659.0

It starts with what the problem was, and works it's why backwards 5 times. Reading through some of these stories I've found myself curious about what people's 5 whys would be, and if maybe writing them down and seeing them on paper may help some people figure out where they were responsible vs where the opiates were responsible.

I got kicked out of my house and had no where to go last night .

Why? - because my parents found out I stole 200 dollars from my moms purse.

Why? - because I knew I didn't have any money and I desperately needed to score

Why? - because I spent my entire pay check on dope just a couple days after pay day

Why? - because I didn't worry about anything other then my next high, I didn't care about the consequences, I knew it was a mistake 

Why? - because I have become addicted to instant gratification and have lost my ability to plan for anything beyond today

When you look at the issue like this, you see multiple different mistakes, and you realize if you just stopped yourself from committing one of those then you could have broke the cycle and prevented the ultimate problem we started with. I think this allows you to take back responsibility, to see how much control you have and how it is never about one decision, it's lots of little decisions that get us into trouble and we only need to break one of those poor decisions to really help us out in the end, seems more manageable this way to me.

Is that inevitable ? So many people here get noticeably offended when you try and speak about opiate use in any type of light or humorous manner, like this is no joke and you signed your death wish and your an idiot for thinking you can smile and talk about opiates at the same time. I hate those people. Been doing opiates for a few years now, whenever I get too deep I take a mandatory month and a half off. I'll go through withdrawals but they end, and at the end of that month and a half I'll use recreationally again. My question is, what's everyone's consensus? Is opiates dependence really so far out of the users hands that we can't take personal responsibility and therefore don't have a right to playfully talk about it, am I wrong for hating the people who feel the need to freak out and bring everyone down to their level? Genuinely curious if I'm being ignorant in my belief that there is enough personal responsibility that opiate users have the right to talk how they want about it. I currently don't buy into the idea that opiates are always fully in control therefore you must treat them as if you have zero say in how your experience will inevitably go. ",1503693040.0

UPDATE: I tried to dissolve the pills in water but have limited tools ATM. Ended up with some slimy watery blue mix with pieces of sticky morphine in it. Squeezed the water up ass on office toilet while bending forward as much as possible. Took remaining pieces of the pill that were stuck in the cup and shoved them up ass. The cup still had a lot of slimy residue and a little water left so I wiped it with tiny pieces of tissue and shoved them up my ass. One piece slipped out and I grabbed it from the (clean) toilet bowl and re-inserted. Hung around on toilet for a few and now waddling around office with clenched asshole and morphine sludge and tissues up my ass, trying to look inconspicuous. 

UPDATE 2:  concerned that my first round of buttphine wouldn't be enough, I took another 90 mg with of pills, crushed them between spoons, and wrapped half of the powder in a teeny ass satchel from a 1"" square of TP.  Pooped out some of the previous work into a cup; it came out as a slimy nugget of gloppy toiletpaper. Inserted ass satchel into butt and put some of the first buttnugget back in.

Throw away here.
I've been a lurker on this sub for a while. 

I'm not a user.

I just think this is home to some of the most interesting people, and your stories and experiences have really changed the way I *used* to think of the opioid epidemic. 

Why am I posting here? 

I have a couple questions actually and was wondering if anyone would be open to answering them for me. 

My first, shitty question, is would anyone be willing to share certain experiences they've had with me? I feel like the world's BIGGEST sleaze ball for asking, but I have a small story I've been writing and I would love to get info on first hand experiences. It's probably never gonna go anywhere but my laptop, but I'd be happy to throw your user name(s) in if god forbid I ever finished anything and attempted to publish. If you're interested I can pm you if you don't really want it posted. 

And if no one feels up to that, that's cool too, just figured I'd ask.

Last question, seriously, how can I get involved locally to help out? I really want to get on board with helping harm reduction, however I'm super limited on time and can't volunteer a lot. But there must be something I can do. Any idea where I could start? 

Anyways, hope you all have good day. Stay safe friends.

While cruising certain places though I came across a vendor that seems to take Opium very seriously (I was after Indica which is harder to find in my area than you might think) and I'm considering getting a small amount just because.

So, the point of this post; in the product description they spend a good deal of time talking about how Opium should be. It's *""actual Opium Latex, as it should be""*, and I've got no issue with this because as I understand it, that's correct (and [Erowid](https://erowid.org/chemicals/opiates/opiates_faq.shtml) backs this up).

On top of that, and i guess the main part, is: *""Real Opium Latex should never be sticky or black, even under heat or pressure; this is not real Opium""*. Now, after browsing threads on Reddit, I'm aware that there's been fake stuff going around in areas that aren't my own and in threads dating over a year ago. Can it really never be squidgy? Some of my previous stuff has resembled black hash and/ or been sticky (resembling something we used to call ""Squidgy B""). 

The main thing I'd like from this thread is other users experience with Opium Latex. Have you been sold Black Tar as Opium? Maybe some of this ""Red Rock"" stuff? Does the bio add up in your experience? I've got no reason not to believe the seller, they definitely know more than I do when it comes to this but I just wanted this subs input as well, I'm a big fan of other people's experiences although with this question it's been a bit lacking.

By the way, this isn't a ""should I buy"", the trigger's already been pulled.

Anyway to make the dope usable? 



So, this may very well be my dumbest moment yet, but last night, I ran out of sharps, and I hate smoking tar, and monkey water never works for me, so I tried to make it into a powder, following a very simple process I found online. 

The basic method was add just enough water to dissolve the tar, then add just enough of some type of powder to absorb the tar liquid. Now you have snortable tar. Simple enough. 

Unfortunately, it was also 5am, on day 4 of a meth binge, so I wasn't all there mentally.

First, I accidentally added way too much water. No big deal, just gotta snort more powder. 

Now here's where my stupidity shines. I completely forgot, until I had already added 1800mg worth of anhydrous caffeine powder, that caffeine is in fact not only a psychoactive substance, but also I just added enough to seriously fuck someone up, especially if they are on stims already, and haven't slept in 3 days. 

So now I have a paste, containing 12x more caffeine than tar. Normally, since I'm not physically addicted to opiates, I would have just chalked it up to a loss, and tossed it. 

However, now I'm at day 5 in said meth binge, and I was planning on coming down tonight. The issue is, the only non OTC med I have that can help with meth comedown is some weed, and that tar. And I have work tommorow. 

Normally, work the next day isn't a problem for me, as taking some H at the tail end of an ice binge is enough to knock me out for up to 12 hours, and I wake up feeling (almost) normal. This is the method I've been using for the last 2 years, and it has yet to fail me. 

I could always just take more ice tommorow, but things start to get really weird for me after 5 days, and I'm not sure I could be inconspicuous at work. And calling off isn't an option, because I was just told today that the only other person who could do my job tommorow can't be there. Hence why I'm going in the first place. 

My plan currently is just to drink, take some benadryl, and smoke a bunch of weed, and hope that knocks me out. But last time I did that, even though I fell asleep for a long time, I woke up still feeling like shit from the binge. 

But I figured I'd see if, by some miracle, anybody knows how to reverse my fuck up, or at the very least, make the tar usable without giving me a heart attack in the process. 

And before anybody suggests it, I already hit up everybody I know to see if they have any extra benzos or opiates I could buy, and nobody does.

I realize that this whole situation is just a very long series of me fucking up, but I'm hoping that it's somehow salvageable. ",1503797249.0

Please help,"So I gave up shooting up myself because I apparently suck really bad at it and always wind up missing. Only occasionally, I have others shoot for me when I do IV. After not trying for a long time I decided to give it a shot again, no pun intended, and like an idiot thought I could actually successfully do it this time, but of course I wound up missing AGAIN...Fortunately, this time only bth by itself was used and was not a speedball or a goofball like I have missed multiple times in the past. It is not red or discolored at all however the swelling has increased since yesterday and it is pretty sore to the touch and when moving arm a little bit. At this point, it does not seem like an abscess (even though I have fortunately never gotten one, but just from all the information I have read online while being freaked out about missing shots in the past), but just a little concerned that the swelling has increased since yesterday. Yesterday I ran some warm water over it and put on a warm compress that I got from Walgreens, also applied some rubbing alcohol and Neosporin even though there is no or what it seems like infected area just swelling. 

Should I keep putting warm compresses over the swelled area? This time I am going to use a warm washcloth heated up using hot water, I feel like that seems to have been more effective than using the warm compress from Walgreens in the past. Is there anything that you guys recommend that I do to get the swelling down other than what I have said I plan on doing? Is this something to be concerned about, the fact that it's swelled up a little bit more since yesterday? I only injected about 30 units, there is not really a lump or anything, just some shallow swelling, but the area it is swelled around is a little bigger than I would expect for only 30 units. Not sure if this information helps at all, but this time and almost every single other time I have missed in the past, I never got a burned sensation or any kind of pain while shooting up, I have definitely felt that before and this is not it. I guess I am piercing through the vein, moving the rig after I register, or doing something after I have already registered that constantly causes this to happen. Almost right after I finishing pushing in, I know it is a miss because I do not feel any rush whatsoever like I normally do when someone else hits for me, then shortly following I get a lump and/or area starts to swell. ... All tips and recommendations are greatly appreciated about what I should do to help take care of this problem without hopefully needing to go to urgent care are greatly appreciated. TIA 

UPDATE -, so I applied warm compresses off and on for about 3 days and it actually started going down a little. I would also apply rubbing alcohol followed by Neosporin on it multiple times a day as well. Currently it has significantly gone down, but there still is a little lump there doesn't really seem to be going away hopefully within the next couple weeks it will go down or at least be gone for good. I still try to apply rubbing alcohol and Neosporin on it as much as I can to prevent any infections from making it worse. I am not sure but I don't think that it would make any difference to keep applying warm compresses at this point I think it only is helpful during the first couple days or so correct me if I'm wrong though please. Also if you guys have any other tips or suggestions that you could recommend still for how it currently is please let me know thank you!",1503791926.0

Throwaway account...was a h user for a few years, detoxed back in december. Got back onto kratom in april because my dumbass forgot how easily I get trapped. Anyways...was taking up to an oz a day of kratom (maybe ~30mg hydro equivalent?). Wife gave me an ultimatum so I took a naltrexone even though I'd had kratom just a few hours earlier.

Holy shit the withdrawals were insane. I've gone into precipitated w/d on H and this felt the same, but it only lasted 90mins compared to 8hours from h.

The w/d has gotten milder and milder over time. I even took another naltrexone last night w/o getting massively sick again. It's been 44hours since that first naltrexone and the w/d is pretty mild. Just goosebumps and some back pain/trouble sitting still.

What can I expect? Help me nut up and get thru this thing. I need to be free of all this stuff. Going to take another naltrexone this evening. Wish me luck. Prayers for all the addicts out there still suffering. There is hope.",1503934322.0

I am however coming into possession of 28 x 10mg Targin (Oxycodone + Naloxone 5mg). I don't have much experience with opiates but around 300mg codeine gets me pretty damned high. 

So say 300mg codeine ~ 30mg Oxycodone. Also Naloxone isn't active orally so this is the ROA I will have to use. Should I simply pop say 3 of them and see where that gets me? Can I parachute them for increased effect (given they are time-release)? **I've read all the advice I could find via google/bluelight and some people say they had much better results crushing and parachuting but others claim crushing the pills ""releases the naloxone"".** This is somewhat confusing; if naloxone isn't active orally then why would crushing them make a difference? Shouldn't this just increase the availability of the oxycodone? Is it simply because more naloxone is available per unit time? Is this claim just BS? Should I crush and parachute or just use orally? If so how should I approach this? 

Any advice is much appreciated! Cheers :D

**EDIT: Also considering naloxone has a max duration of action of 1 hour but oxycodone is in the multiple hours I presume effects would continue to climb past this 1 hour period? I am not addicted to opiates either so I presume this hour of minor naloxone exposure wouldn't really impact the following action of the oxy? What initial dose should I try?**",1503933011.0

Okay, so here I am, just got my fix, feeling well and relaxed and yet I'm still very troubled by what's on my mind...
The love of my life and heroin. 
(Two things that are generally almost always on my mind so what's new right?)
Well anyways, 
I remember once being asked, ""what's the worst thing you've done in your addiction"" 
And my answer was: 
Getting someone else addicted. 

I mean yeah I've done a lot of shady/grimey things to feed this beast but when I look back at everything, I have a tremendous amount of guilt regarding the fact I got my BF physically addicted to opiates. That's probably the ""worst"" in my book. 
And yeah yeah, you can't blame anyone but themselves, I mean I didn't stick a gun to his head and force heroin into him day and night but dammit He didn't stand a good chance being with me and the size of my habit. 

So a little back story--
We met in January this year and it was truly love at first site. He and I have SO much in common and we clicked together so well, even if we weren't romantically involved, I could see myself being best friends with him. Unfort. One of the things we had in common was the fact we were both addicts. 
His twist has always been uppers, specifically coke. 
He's struggled with his addiction for as long as I have struggled with my opiates. 
So we were able to relate about that right off the bat. I was so relieved to hear that he had no interest in opiates..he didn't like the way the made him feel, etc. 
so a perfect storm right??

Well pretty early on in the relationship we would start use together. I would do my thing and he would do his. I had no interest in hard and he had no interest in h. 
Yet we still coexisted our highs so well.  We had so much fun. Crazy long awesome sex sessions. Up all night with amazing conversations. He's a chef so he would cook up amazing food and life was literally perfect (you know that denial-of-a-crippling-drug-addiction ""perfect"") 

Well as it always goes, our binges together would stretch longer and longer. 
So every now and then I would give him bumps. I personally know how amazing opiates help with coke comedowns. And he does too. 
And like classic addict behavior, he would start craving that sweet relief and relaxation after binging and being up all the time. 

Now he is 10years older then me and he's tried opiates every now and then over the course of his active drug use. Like I stated before, it ""wasn't his thing"". And naturally, when I'd give him a bump, I would make it very small and space them out, warning him of how easy it is to become physically addicted. 
He would say, don't worry, I'll never let that happen. I'll moderate, etc. etc.
Same lies I told myself too. 

Well fast forward about 3 months, and I had been sharing small lines with him every now and then. 
He started associating his coke binges with being able to relax with some H. I saw it coming. I saw it happening and yet I didn't do anything. 
I kept sharing my stuff. And if anything I was getting deeper and deeper into my rabbit hole. 

Now fast forward to today. His is physically addicted and now has a cross addiction. He does very small amounts of h but it's enough that he has to do it every day to stay well, like me. And the fact I take grave sympathy over withdrawing, any time he was uncomfortable, I would make sure to save my stash so he was well. 
LUCKILY he doesn't have that mental addiction like me, and doesn't truly enjoy opiates so that's a plus. It'll be a lot easier for him to stop. I mean
 We even tried kicking it together and that was successful for about 8 days..all while still smoking hard though, and the steak ended due to ME caving and buying more. but I have faith he could do it when it really comes down to it.
Me on the other hand..my recovery is going to take a hell of a lot more work, but it's never too late, amiright?

Anyways idk, I just needed to vent this out. It's a shitty situation and I feel responsible. I know it takes two to tango and its not ALL my fault. But I just feel like a bad influence. 
I love this man so much. 
And to see him like this. 
To see us like this. 
-please no negative comments, I already feel shitty enough. I just really wanted to share and by typing this all out, I already feel better. 

So thanks if you took the time to read this. If you can relate, please share. 

TL:DR: 
I feel serious guilt over introducing my bf to h and he is now physically addicted.

Like I'm exhausted but my mind is buzzing with thoughts of the awesome shit I want to do. Or at least the utterly mundane waste of time which I may consider awesome in my drug addled state. 

So invariably I end up staying up all night and set myself up for quite the narcoleptic nodfest the next day. 

Once you're missing a night of Z's your nodding isn't all cutesie anymore. Each nod is a potential trainwreck. It doesn't stop at 45° with a ""huh?"" and a giggle. They're pretty much guaranteed to be 90° of ""Oh fuck"" *frantic breathing* .. ""I might have broken my arm, I dunno, .. I sure hope nobody saw me fall over"" .. ""Did I fall over? .. WTF DID I DO??"" .. ""Wait how long have I been sitting here trying to figure this all out??"" .. ""Oh fuck I gotta go"" .. ""Lemme just light a cig and walk home like it's all gravy""  ..  ""Hahah I was just getting paranoid, silly"" .. 

*proceed to nod in the middle of lighting my cigarette*  ..  Beard is on fire while I'm far and away .. 3 seconds of eternal void later a group of concerned strangers gather around a man who looks like one of those homeless guys that was just given one of those pityful makeovers...  ""Shit where's my phone..""

You get the idea..               Basically I try to just stay home whenever I am sleep deprived with a stash of opiates. 

I just wanted to share something that I enjoy doing when I'm blasted out of my mind. Which is to check my browsing history when I ""wake up"" from a nod. 

It's really fun because it feels like I'm inside that movie called memento. I try to leave criptic messages to my future-nodded out-self.

Each nod can feel both like a second or ""How many hours was I .. ??"" so the browser history (because I sit in front of the pc like a brick of afghan when I'm wasted) is a great forensic tool to determine the approximate beginning and end of my unconscious phases. 

I guess that's it. Thanks for reading.",1503930608.0

D moved west from the East coast and we were living in Los Angeles together. We met in a sober living then got jobs and moved into our own spot as roommates. He had never done black tar, and we had been off opiates for about 120 days. We got the pinche carga and he didn't know how to cook it up.  Since everything was new (rigs, cooker, cottons) I cooked one shot for both of us then drew into two syringes. I gave myself about 25 cents and him about 15. Maybe it was 22 to18. I definitely gave myself a significantly larger shot out of selfishness (nothing more, nothing less).  Both being veterans we hit simultaneously. I still remember our last conversation. I said, ""Damn this is good shit."" D replied, ""Fuck yea it is!"". I fell out immediately after that. He fell out soon after and never woke up.
 
At this point, you should know I'm 150 pounds when I'm not strung out. He was pushing 235. I know this because he was getting close to rep’ing that 3 times on flat bench.
 
I woke up in a frantic haze, both confused and fucked up out of my mind. We shot up in my car. When I fell out he was in the passenger seat next to me. After I stumbled to half consciousness, I realized both my passenger door and rear passenger door were open. He was on his stomach in the back seat lying across all three seats.
 
I flipped him over, immediately checked for a pulse and to see if he was breathing. I couldn't tell from the driver’s seat. I slapped him, yelled his name, and poured water on him; he didn't even flinch. I got out of the driver’s seat, walked to the passenger side and realized he was only halfway in the car. His head and torso, and part of his thighs were in. His feet were touching the blacktop of the parking lot. I remember thinking to myself, ""What the fuck was this motherfucker doing!??"".
 
I pushed his legs in the car, and drove no more than 2 minutes as I dialed 911. I wanted to get out of the parking lot into the alley in the back. Mind you I was so fucked up I wasn’t thinking clearly. I think my mindset was, this decreases a cop seeing us (because only an ambulance is going to show up when I call 911). Like I said, I wasn't fucking thinking clearly and was running on straight adrenaline.
 
After getting our location, the dispatcher suggested I start CPR. I hung up, manned up and started compressions. ""Ah, ah, ah, ah, staying alive, staying alive, ah, ah, ah, ah, staying alive, staying alive."" Then I really fucking manned up, plugged his nose and gave him mouth to mouth through the white shit all over his lips, mouth, and face. Then back to compressions, and repeat. Till fucking 10-15 minutes later an ambulance finally arrives. ""Fucking finally!"" I yell at them. As they rush over to him, I walk back to the driver’s side of my car, light a cigarette, and take my first breath of relief. I enjoy my high for the first time, albeit briefly.
 
Then the story really gets fucked. The EMTs work on him for all of 15 seconds, pronounced him dead on the scene and covered him.
 
I screamed at them when I turned and saw him covered. ""What the fuck are you doing? Run Narcan, run adrenaline, hit him with some fucking paddles.""
 
""It's too late he's been gone too long, sorry there is no brain activity. He's dead."" They left within 5 minutes.
 
So, me, two cops, and his lifeless body waited in this back alley for 2 hours for the coroner to show up. The whole time I'm literally in the middle of the street, on my knees, sobbing to a god whose existence I usually reject, to take me instead. Finally, the coroner got there and was the first to actually have a conversation with me. I succinctly remember the EMTs kind of joking with each other. I get they need to detach themselves from emotional connection to patients, but it is one of those blip memories I'll always have of that night.
 
Anyway, the coroner said, ""please man don't go to that empty apartment (I told him we were roommates). Go be with family."" I was from San Diego. This whole time I had been lying to the EMTs then the Cops saying there was no dope. The coroner saved my life that night.  He convinced me to give him the rest of the dope. He must have known I was lying about not using myself, I mean my pupils must have been non-existent, but I was running on pure adrenaline, and acting convincingly sober. We bought a G and did less than a quarter of it between the two of us. So, I hand the coroner three quarters of a G.  I know I would have done more if I hadn't.
 
So back to answering your question; The 2-hour, middle of the night, so-fucked-up-I-had-to-pull-over-3-times-to-puke, drive to San Diego was followed by 2 very hazy days. I really don't remember much except for lying in bed sobbing, feeling bad for myself, and talking to D's Dad. He was a defeated man, a man with 4 daughters and one now deceased son. I started racking my brain why him, why not me? I did more, weighed less, why did I live? I was jealous at that point to be honest (wow that felt fucked up even writing). But yes, I felt guilt.
 
I cooked that shot, but I did not put that needle in his arm. But I cooked that shot. Also, he seemed more apathetic about getting high that night while I remained adamant. We were using Craigslist so it was a drawn-out process and he kept saying ""fuck it"" while I searched and sent emails to anonymous dealers, he was laughing at IG videos. The minute someone came through though, he was more than ready to ride.
 
Let me stop at this point and say everything I've written is irrelevant in my mind. I've had to reconcile everything to it being his time, and not mine. I've turned D's death into a motivation. I've turned him into a warrior against that life whether in my mind, or maybe to someone reading this. Shit happens so quick, Narcan isn't a failsafe. I learned that the hardest of ways. I needed to stop being a fucking victim and live my life.
 
I switched perspectives, I thought to myself, if I died and D lived, would I want him pondering the what ifs for the rest of his life? FUCK NO! I'd want him to get over it, stop playing victim, get off that shit, and live a productive life.
 
So fuck survivors guilt. I'm not invincible. We all have a clock, and the thing is: nobody knows when that clock is going to strike midnight.

So I posted in the thread about ppl hurting themselves to get hospital meds and someone asked me to tell the story. Liking to write down the shit I've experienced and being on meth! The story was longer and less concise than I'd intended but here it is. 

We had checked into a motel. We were living the hard shitty life of hustling dope and money every day and staying at whatever hotel was cheapest. Well she killed the car. We'd been riding around without fucking brakes for a while. We used the e brake for a while but it died also. Nothing like riding shotgun to cop with a crazy dopesick woman puking while driving insanely fast bc she's sick in a car with no way to fucking stop. Ran a bunch of lights and other sketch shit. Well anyway car dies and we get stuck at this hotel. Cars unfixably dead. We run out of dope the next morning. 

I've found that there's two types of people when dopesick. I'm the type that says ""this is really fucking bad but I've lived it countless times and this too shall pass"" and her who is the ""I will literally rob my own mother or child to get well I'm going to die"". So on the second day she's off the rails. We have to check out of the hotel in an hour. She dead serious tells me we should straight up kill ourselves. Go run a hot bath and slit our wrists together. She tries to convince me for like 15 straight minutes and nothing I say can convince her life is or even can eventually be worth living. I know this a delicate fucking situation where I may have to try to physically take her fucking knife away. Fuck that. I say okay baby we'll do it. We will go out together. Fuck this world. But I had one condition. We do it via overdose and die as we lived. She agrees and I get her out the door. 

I knew that with our tolerance we would never be able to hustle or scam enough dope to off ourselves with and that once she got well this suicide nonsense would be off the table and I could hopefully get her on methadone. The clinic I'd found did the first 30 days for a dollar a day like good pushers. So off we go to scrape money. She wanted to rob ppl/places/things but I've always been against fucking over other ppl. I believe in karma. She on the other hand eventually robbed everyone we knew together. Dboys,ppl I middled for and sold her pills to. Really good ppl. I was in jail at the time but that's another story. I decide upon panhandling. It's shitty and I fucking hate it but she was off the fucking rails. So I'm trying to scrape up money and she's casing everything and whining constantly. We re in a parking lot and she says ""fuck this we aren't getting anywhere. I'll bet the hospital will give me something for a broken arm"" then proceeds to go over to one of those hard ass yellow poles they put in parking lots to keep cars from damaging the store or whatever and then proceeds to full on swing her arm as hard as she fucking can into it with all her force and her arm hitting it in the middle of the forearm. She did this shit twice before I could get to her to stop her. 

All I could think was ""Jesus fucking Christ she's gone completely sideways. This is BAD."" I convince her (lie) that I've almost got enough money. Just sit on this bench and I'll be done so go ahead and call our closest local dboy and make sure he is good. Thank god her arm didn't break. She had a gnarly bruise. After 15 min I see this spot isn't working so I get her to walk with me across the street to a pharmacy so I can keep an eye on her batty dopesick ass. Mind you I'm sick as all fucking hell also. If it was just me I would've found a quiet place to lay down and be miserable but she was literally going to run out into traffic if I didn't get her dope. Manipulative as fuck and all. 

Anyway as we walk up into the pharmacy we see a weird looking van and a guy carrying big plastic bins from the van into the store. She says that's how the pharmacy gets their good pills and we need to rob that van. Fucking fuck that shit I thought but again she was off the rails. Before I can say no wait she tries to run up and pull the door open. Locked. She tries another door. Also locked thank god. She begins stupidly pulling on the door with both hands and crying. I'm finally able to pull her away from this stupidity and she literally goes running off to this beat up truck and yells ""I bet we can get a front from (insert name of top notch cool dealer that's all the way in the city) if we can just get to him or we can trade this!"" Fuck my fucking life. I chase after her again. Doors locked again. Thank god again. 

I pull her to a bench and sit her down and promise her I'll have the money in less than 5 min and to think of how we can get to (insert name of shitty local dboy that was more of a middle at this point and years later skrrted away from me stealing a half of a fucking sub I would've just given him). This was of course another lie. I didn't even have enough for a pack of cigs. Gotta think fast lobster the fucking walls are closing in. 

Then I see my salvation. A fairly well dressed man walking out of the pharmacy. He was wearing pink and said hello to me in that gay accent. Well I'm a decent looking dude and was in my mid twenties. Him in his 40s. I start talking to him and make it a point to seem down but act like I'm just trying to be friendly. Don't ask him for shit. He asks if something's bothering me. I basically give him this spiel about how my boyfriend whom I loved more than anyone in the world recently came out to his father and his hardass baptist father disowned him and threw us out of the house and how we just needed to make it one more night in the hotel until my aunt and her girlfriend could make it down here to pick us up. Dude went for it wholeheartedly and handed me a fresh crisp 50. He insisted on getting my number so he could check up on us in the future and help us when we were struggling and told me a long story about how he knows what it's like and yada yada. As soon as I had that 50 I wanted to run the fuck off but I have trouble being like that to ppl so I continued to talk with him for what felt like forever to maintain that set of lies. I later answered his calls and text always saying we were doing better and he eventually offers me money for a 3some with me and my fictitious boyfriend. This is way later I'm getting derailed. 

Anyway as soon as he's out of sight I run back to my crazy junky gf and tell her we're good and I told you not to do anything drastic. Let's find a ride (shithead local guy was good). We proceed to pretend to be as wholesome as possible and start asking ppl for rides. We finally find a taker. A nice woman who had a car full of sports equipment for a fat camp in the north of our state. She drops us off at our house (shithead dboys house) and we go in and get sweet fucking relief. Then we have a long fucking talk about her batshit insane behavior and methadone. We do intake at the clinic the following morning. I unfortunately have many crazy crazy tales of being with her. Still not convinced that she isn't a full on sociopath. 
 
Fuck my life I can't believe I wrote this. Meths a hell of a drug. If you actually read this shit reply or pm and lmk how that went. 


 If you made it this far congratulations! You've just earned the opilobster ultimate meth!post achievement! Display it proudly.

Really dont have anywhere else to post this so here i am maybe someine can relate or help, idk.

My dad is on over 180mg of oxycodone per day for pain management, blue roxies and oxycontin, all that shit.

He frequently buys extra shit cause he runs out often, but he abuses it basically.

When he nods off i swear to god he acts like hes dead sometimes, i rememebr walking in at around 2 am and he was bent over in the recliner he often sleeps in i called his name like 5 times and when he wasnt responding by the 5th i got really scared he might have od'd and i ran over to him and shook him and he woke up, do you think he was close to od? I believe so and ive been watching him really closely ever since. It scared me to death cause my dad is my best friend, i can talk to him about anything, such as my addiction and he understands and has helped me out im tapering off currently. 

But he also is probably about to get prescribed opana and im worried to death as he likes to snort his roxies and shit, if he gets opana i think one day he might overdo it and lose his life. I dont know what to do i dont talk to him about it cause its a touchy subject.

But sorry just a random ramble and i have nobody else to talk to. If you read the whole thing thank you so much.",1503884369.0

My highest dosage was about 180mg/day. My doc and I tapering now, or at least trying to, so my daily dosage is now currently between 105-120mg/day. We recently discussed taking LDN twice a day to start building up and endorphins and reducing tolerance. So, I decided to try it out. Doc gave me a few 50mg tabs, and directed me to dissolve one in water, and to take a tsp of the diluted solution a couple to a few times per day. Turns out his directions were wrong, in the sense that even a tsp of this elixir, which I calculated contains roughly .2mg, blocks the effects of the opiate if I choose to take both around the same time (unavoidable, as I dose oxy several times a day to keep WD at bay). So, I read some medical docs, and found that the ideal dosage of LDN (here, it becomes ""ultra-LDN"") to reduce tolerance, and increase the effects is about 1mcg (.002 mg). I've been doing this for a few days, and I really think its  brought back a bit of the high from the oxy (i.e. euphoric aspect), and is delayed onset of WD from last dose by a few hours (wow!). This is good news. My question is, is this miniscule dosage going to be able to raise my endorphin levels, like we are hoping to do? Or may I need to take a larger dose before bed, yet not large enough that it blocks the effects of my morning oxy dose? Perhaps I may need to omit AM oxy dose? Anyone have opinions? Thanks in advance. And, if you're troubled by your rampant opiate consumption, and you need an outlet to lighten your mind up a bit so you'll gradually feel positive enough to detox once and for all, give this LDN a go--it's really helping me here so far!

I won't lie, it has been a very hard journey so far. The cravings for coke cut deep, and the subtle yearning for Heroin is just constant background noise at this point. 

On the bright side, I am somewhat productive, considering I'm in rehab. They got us working from Monday to Friday, and the daily routine of sober life is setting in slowly. I feel not elated or euphoric as I did when puking my guts out after getting my bell rung *right* but just fine. Just a sustainable feeling of being somewhat at ease. The moments are fleeting and I still have to deal with a bunch of legal and financial BS (ramifications of hardcore drug abuse yadda yadda). Overall however I have an inkling of how sober life outside of rehab could look like for me.


I have become curious and open for new impulses again. I no longer schlep my sorry ass through daily routines while obnoxiously opiated and I'm finally broadening my horizon now that the fog has cleared. I'm reading tons, Camus, Nietzsche, Truman Capote, DeLillo, non-fiction works on everything from the fall of Rome to civilization history, German national identity. I'm listening to bunch of new music too, Geto Boys, Goodie Mob, Scarface, Cynic, Atheist, Boards of Canada....just everything.


I wanna know as much about the world, its history and art as possible. I wanna extract the beauty from out of everything and BANG THAT SHIT.


Just shitposting but tl;dr sobriety works if you find a way to replace the heroin. Get something else to make you happy or at least not depressed. For me it's the purpose of attaining knowledge on art, history, society...anything (yes I sound fedora as fuck.)

I don't intend to be preachy on y'all. I know I'm still not in the clear and relapse is lurking behind every corner. But I'm doing good for now, and that's all I'm asking for.",1503864093.0

Firstly I'm not sure whether this is the correct sub to ask this question, if it's not then I will move the discussion to another one

I am a 62kg (150ish in freedom units) male who's trying opiates for his second time in life. The first experience I had was with codeine, and it did feel good but it was a very small dose so the high was quite subtle. This was like a year ago.

Now I got my hands into some dihydrocodeine, which I hear is about 1.5-2x as potent as codeine. I've also done DXM a couple weeks ago which apparently triggers most opioid receptors.

**As someone with little to zero tolerance to opiates, how much should I take for the first time?** Does cannabis in your experience enhance the high, and if so, should I reduce my dose? I know THC is a vasodilator, which could mean that more DHC is absorbed through your bloodstream (?)

I am coming into possession of 28 x 10mg Targin (Oxycodone + Naloxone 5mg). I don't have much experience with opiates but around 300mg codeine gets me pretty damned high. 

Naloxone isn't active orally so this is the ROA I will have to use. Should I simply pop say 3 of them and see where that gets me? Can I crush and parachute them for increased effect (given they are a basic time-release matrix)? **I've read all the advice I could find via google/bluelight and some people say they had much better results crushing and parachuting but others claim crushing the pills ""releases the naloxone"".** This is somewhat confusing; if naloxone isn't active orally then why would crushing them make a difference? Shouldn't this just increase the availability of the oxycodone? Is it simply because more naloxone is available per unit time? Is this claim just BS? Should I crush and parachute or just take a decent amount whole? Either way how much should I dose in either swallowing whole/crushing and parachuting and how long should I wait to re-dose as needed for more/continued effect?

Any advice is much appreciated! Cheers :D

Also considering naloxone has a max duration of action of 1 hour but oxycodone is in the multiple hours I presume effects would continue to climb past this 1 hour period? I am not addicted to opiates either so I presume this hour of minor naloxone exposure wouldn't really impact the following action of the oxy? What initial dose should I try?",1503988349.0

Like most it started with norcos/percocets 8 years ago. Met my boyfriend 3 years ago and he had addiction problems of his own. Broke his back 10 years ago in a car accident and was prescribed crazy amounts of opiods for years.  He went into a sub program,  but ended up falling into bad habits buying black daily from a chef at his work.  I eventually tried smoking it and wasn't really impressed, but it was cheap so I didn't complain. Fast forward 2 years. He was smoking pretty much a gram a day of black,  and I was gradually smoking more and more. Pain pills don't really phase me anymore, but they still take the edge off. He ended up moving away because in his words it was a life or death situation. He said if he continued on this path he wasn't going to make it. I agreed with him and supported anything he wanted to do. So two days later after he left, I find a note on my car. It's his dealer. He wrote a note saying are you okay?  Call me. Now, I never bought black on my own,  boyfriend usually just gave me a point here and there that would last me all day. Now I'm lonely, and what do I do?  Hit up his dealer and start buying off him daily. I just wish I wasn't such an addict. I have a normal life for the most part.  Solid job at a corporate grocery store. On my way to becoming manager.  Heavily liked at work because I pick up everyone's slack.  No one has any idea I'm addicted to heroin most likely. I take good care of myself,  work out every day with no days off. Anyways,  I usually go to the bathroom or my car and smoke 5-8 times a day. It's almost like since my boyfriend left to get clean, I've smoke more and more to fill the void of missing him. Used to never be able to smoke a point in a day. Now I can easily smoke a quarter gram a day. I'm such an addict, I have a strep throat from work, but continue to chain smoke cigarettes.  What is wrong with me. I think I need therapy.  Thanks for reading, sorry if it wasn't very eventful.  Just have no one that knows about my addiction,  besides my boyfriend who doesn't even know I linked up with his dealer since he left. I should have thrown that note away when he left it on my car.

Honest feedback?

My Story.

My story with the poppy, Is quite fucked up.

The dread pirate roberts of don’t give a fuck.

Started shit early, Got a jump on the game.

Early bird gets the worm and I’m not even playing.

You want advice? This life is inconceivable!

You want my rhetoric? That shit is unbelievable.

I made it out by the hair of my chinny chin chin

And If you truly want to know, This is where it begins.

I started raiding cabinets at the age of thirteen.

Pills helped me out by making me less mean.

Wish I’d been a club kid but fuck all that lean

Because I’m not, some lil wayne queen.

I started out sniffing pills,

But liked his songs about making a mill.

Then hit them patches, Chewing all day

Nodding the fuck out, What did I say?

Escalating is fine, Im in control,

Not spiraling downward, I think that I know.

Then my life got fucked up way worse.

My family assumed they’d be renting a hearse.

A funeral was in my tarot cards.

I was oblivious, just kept going hard.

I guess I quit dope, and now it gets better.

I ruin parties in my ugly sweater.

I drink myself dumb,

Ask relatives to pull my thumb.

The biggest joke of the party,

Since I was age one.

But, That shit is okay, Because I’m legal today.

Drunk as fuck but I’m not driving you say?

Challenge accepted.

Watch me outrun the cops while I’m drifting.

Watch me wild and out for the street cred I’m getting.

Watch me be the joker in the deck of cards.

Watch the liquid courage make me think I’m hard.

Delusions of Grandeur only go so far…

Spilled coke and H water. Must sslvage. https://imgur.com/gallery/WLghw

I need to have this done by tomorrow. My landlord is doing an inspection. I couldn't get razor blades today. I'm thinking about wetting it and just snorting the water. But I'd love to put it in a container for after work.

Of course I nodded off and dropped some on the floor, twice. FUCK.

I want to share my bday score but I'm dealing withthis shit. 

I've used a cotton to soak shit up from my table before.  Something I'd never do now. The only way I even touch dope I'm going to shoot is with scissors. I cut a piece of the chunk, use the scissors to transfer it to the cooker.

The only time I got sick was when I fell asleep with a rig in my arm. But I ot really sick. Swelling all over. Walking on my ankle cause my leg didn't work. ""Water breast"" over my heart... fucking terrifying.

I've cooked a blood dope mix again and tried to do it a second time. Most of the time I was cateful but a few times I did stuff that I look back on and cringe.

I WANT TO POST ABOUT MY BIRTHDAY SCORE. And how the mo price breaks guy is suddenly cutting me a break cause he knows I'll be buying decent sized bags regularly.


OK. HERE WE GO...
I'VE ADDED WATER AFTER IT'S DRIED AND SNORTED IT.....THAT WAS OK.

WHAT I WANT TO DO IS USE A RAZOR BLADE..SCRAPE IT ALL UP AND PUT IT BACK IN MY MONKEY WATER CONTAINER.

I can't stsnd this. I put such a great amount of coke and dope in this mix. And I spilled 3 times in 2 days.

Dabbing with a wet cotton seemed like too much work.

WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN THIS HAPPENS?? All I want to do is share my b day score. And the best shot has been on hold for 2 nights. People keep interrupting.

I could just wet it down and get high. But I gotta wirk early and there's a good dealvof coke in there. Same with the shot. Some that spilled on the floor when I was nodding was just snorted. What you see here is the best mix tho.

I gotta salvage this fast. I gotta be in bed by 11 tops. And even that is pushing it.

At first i said ""super adderall"". That's a good simple description. Actually i said it was adderall on crack for the wordplay factor. I have a word boner for that.

[To preface my description i should note i have tried meth only a handful of times (meth, not even 5 times). Also for accuracy i should add I'm a recovering opiate addict with 2 yrs off the needle and my DoC oxymorphone. I take bupe in low dose now (didn't always but 'relapsed' straight to bupe from fully clean), so i took .6mg buprenorphine the day previous to my experience. Other than bupe with its long half life (i was still in mild withdrawal), no drugs were in my system this day otherwise.]

When meth kicks in, it feels like a m80 powered bottle rocket going off in your stomach, shooting and sparking its way up into your brain and zipping around wildly in its unpredictable way. Guess what, buddy? You're comin along for the ride! These thumb grenades don't explode as quick as the ones mom bitched at you for back in the day either. Sparks'll fly for hours even if after awhile the heat directly on your brain makes it not so pleasurable anymore. Fear not! You will be as stimulated as a clitoris in opiate withdrawal *far* after it stops to feel good (kinda like a big, red, beat up dick after fapping way too long while on way too many drugs)*[1].

My day begins similar enough to any other day, but i knew this wasnt any other day. Today was my day to finally get back on a fun drug for once. I toss and turn, lightly sticking to my bed with sweat. Im in mild withdrawal, same as i am each day i wake up. I wasnt in a hurry to take bupe though. My mind was elsewhere. I quickly text a new connect of mine whose DoC was ice (icy weather as paranoid meth heads have redundantly called it on the phone with me.) All the while i toss and turn a bit in bed, reading reddit and messaging friends. Dude answers soon and asks how much. I pause. I want to do it. I also want someone to talk me into not doing it. I give in for now and continue with the text convo with this meth middle.

Taking bupe for maintenance and especially tapering gets old for a drug addict. There's no high, just no sickness either. I want off so badly that really i justify doing meth if it means i can hold off taking my bupe for another 12-16 hours, and it usually actually works, if you don't run out. All these thoughts circle about my head, but they are drowned out quickly by thoughts of texting my best friend/sponsor that i was about to do something dumb. I tell myself it isnt *that* dumb. Meth i have no issue with. It's not like im doing opiates, right? Fuck, this story has more justifying in it than Bill Cosby in a 1970s motel full of sleeping women and empty bottles of qualuudes. ""Im rich"" ""im famous"" ""im bill fuckin cosby"". Well im none of these things but damnit today im whatever i want. I am the greatest version of myself. I am on meth. I *am* meth... and I've never slept the same since.

I grab my wallet. Then i bum a ride from my dad to my grandparents which is close to the spot im headed. I take off walking from there. 

---


[I start my stimulated endeavor on a backroad, walking back home to my grandparents where i was supposed to be swimming right now. Instead i was off on a small hoof with my new stim advocating acquaintance, who i had met originally as a suboxone connect. (Oh, how we have strayed from the path...) ]

how did it begin already, you ask? Well to my surprise this new friend invited me into his (his mom's) trailer. I glance over at this twitchy middle aged, five o clock shadow wearing at 2pm looking dude. He was also fat for a meth head, only in his belly though. No scabs. When asking why he doesnt get scabs he says, ""because i dont pick myself! I dont look in the mirror, im ugly!"". Now normally a nice guy like me wouldve tried to boost his confidence with a quick witted compliment. My mind was already set on this come up im so close to.. his sudden change from paranoia in the previous weeks caught me off guard. You take a multiple decades long meth head and mix in new people looking for narcotics, naturally you're gonna get some mild paranoia at least, if they even deal with you at all. ""I dont look like your typical meth head"". At first he wouldnt deal with me and wanted me to go through our mutual friend instead, even if this friend would walk right up to his trailer and get the sub for me right there in front of me. Now he seemed to trust me all of the sudden, possibly since i was on his drug now. Maybe he was just grateful i basically bought him a 15$ sack just for getting it. Im either a pushover or just a especially apathetic addict or both, but i gave him 25$, which turned into 30$ pretty quickly after he asked me to borrow 5$ so he ""can get him something"" while walking up the road towards the dope spot. I agree, admiring his honesty. I mean im sure it is still bs he even needed more than my 25$ to get him something too. Damn. Im in my family's neck of the woods now. We walked farther than i initially thought I'd be walking today in the warm, nearly Autumn air. Sweating balls and anxious to get ripped off or seen by family who happen to drive by (one possibly saw me but i hid behind my fat friend, telling him to walk in front of me. No fucking wonder i sketch people out to deal with. My family has officially made copping stuff more trouble than it's worth. I mean they dont actively look for me but if they lnew what i was doin they would start again maybe. Maybe not now that mom has kind of given up. Not on her baby though, she will never give up on me.) I come out of my trance finally now that were back at middles house, after a half mile walking and only a short time waiting outside some random sketchy ass house, luckily obscured from the road by shrubs and trees. 

We walk inside his trailer once back, and i see his mother on the couch hooked up to oxygen. Okay this doesnt feel morally right but okay... whatever goes in that autopilot mode. It was a very small and cramped trailer which was weathered from years of sitting there anchored on this little backroad of a backroad, in the boondocks USA (hi FBI i see yall watching me). Im introduced as just that boy who came his cousin those few days to buy subs. Apparently his mom is the one with the subs? Hmm. I only briefly ponder the nature of that setup there, as i say ""hello"", and we waste no time getting back through the hallway which was almost too small to fit the width of one fat body until reaching my middle's bedroom.

 We both pull out our tiny tied up baggie corners filled with shiny chemical goodness. He throws down a single ply of toilet paper he got from the bathroom beforehand. The deal was he was gonna ""show me how to parachute it"", but in all honesty i didnt wanna eat toilet paper (afraid i might get addicted and have to go on 'my strange addiction'). I just wanted to get my first dose in me a few minutes sooner. Plus, i had a strange fascination with the inside of this trailer since i was barely even welcome to roll up even outside of it in the past. Of course, with just a little time this silver tongued devil wins em all over. I now try to open my baggy and fail. Being that they're the same weight my middle just trades me baggies since his was open. Well at least im pretty sure im not getting fake shit now. If so thats one hell of an elaborate ruse to make it happen. I see this guy expertly fold the tp sheet (he had been taking this shit orally for decades) around the scattered opaque rocks until it is folded up so tight it is smaller than an average pill. He hands it to me along with the rest of my bag. ""So i just gotta swallow it quick?"", i kinda play along since he kinda thinks i don't know what im doing. ""And then i just gotta shit out the toilet paper, huh?"", i ask tongue-in-cheekily. ""Nah... it dissolves"". Oh, right... i inquire about when it might kick in since im now playing ignorant for some reason.  Im really just making conversation so i dont, even briefly, let him see what's under the mask for fear he may never have me back again. ""Youll be feeling it before you even finish walking home."", he assures me. I wonder if he realizes it is a 5 minute walk?

Either way, he was almost right. By the time i reached my grandparents lavish brick house and got inside i was already becoming more talkative and energetic. So maybe ~10-15mins max into the dose i was feeling it (high metabolism helps). I was anxiously excited in the best way even though im not so sure why. The effects didn't necessarily blow me away. Im still convinced the stuff ive gotten around here from all middle men has gotta be trash.  Nonetheless, i was amped as fuck already by the time my grandparents brought me home. Good thing it hadn't fully kicked in at that point because it became really difficult for me to sit still, like more difficult than on IV coke by far. I also could not fucking stop grinding my teeth so i went thru probably two packs of gum. 

I get to my house and ive already walked 20 laps around it without even realizing.  Im pouring sweat due to the stimulation and lack of other meds in my system. I care not and come inside. I wipe the sweat from under my arms with a paper towel and continue pacing the floors, eating crackers if i can, playing music sporadically, but most of all im typing multiple versions of stephen kings the stand in messages to my best friend throughout this process. Shout out to her for not only putting up with me, but also *keeping* up with me somewhat in convo and generally being fun as fuck. I remember trying to get everyone that im close to to call me. As usual no one fucking does because imma spun out loser with friends that are even more antisocial than me.

BERRY'S LIFE STORY IN 3... 2... 1...

TLDR; grew up fixated on being a badass headline making crocked ass defense attorney only to have my hopes and dreams crushed by shitty people working in the school system. So I decided to became a world famous car restoration specialist, I'd have been so good West Coast Customs would have been begging me to work for them, but my daddy told me I would make a shitty one because I'd never touched a car like that before. So, I did the only thing left to do with my life fuck it up with blue collar anonymity and drugs. Full story below. 

My daddy let me watch Goodfellas when I was like four, probably looking back I should question his choices but eh it's a bombass movie so daddy was beast for opening my world to such savagery. 

Anyways, along with that viewing of the greatest movie of all time my dad watched A LOT of Law & Order as well with me early on. So, I developed big dreams young. 

I wanted to be a lawyer, for a solid 13-15 years I told anybody that would listen I was going to be the bestest lawyer Harvard ever did see second to Elle Woods of course. But not just any lawyer, I wasn't going to go to school for all those years to not have a Bentley. I wanted to be a high profile case defense attorney, which later turned into me wanting to be the attorney the mob kept on retainer because I was so goods. 

Then I hit high school and started getting in trouble, and feeling wrongfully treated for petty bullshit wastes of tax dollars I wanted to be a defense attorney even more. I however realised this average no special snowflake having white girl from a shitty shit hole in Ohio was not going to Harvard so I set my dreams on going to law school anywhere I could get in and my parents helped. 

All the peoples I seen because of my legal problems all said, 'Harvard loves charity cases and poverty stricken applicants so you're a shoe in!' Bully much? I was a pampered spoiled rotten middle class white girl who'd never faced adversity or even know what struggling was so IDK what those asshole bullies were talking about 'poverty stricken'. None the less, they made me second guess my abilities which paired with my father telling me he wouldn't help me with out of state college due to my own safety IE he knew I was to sheltered and spoiled to function without my crutch. My crutch being him and his wallet obviously. 

So, I decided lawyer wasn't for me due to lack of fucking support wtf and mostly the amount of schooling involved ultimately. But, I still desired to be in the law field one freaking way or another, while pleasing my father going somewhere in state. Criminology became the new dream, shit why not if the college I wanted to attend confirmed my suspicions of me being a failure I could go to trade school for criminology. 

I eventually came to the conclusion my dad was extremely worried about me going off to college either it be the financial burden or my own safety but his mindset ended up projecting onto me and I decided college wasn't my scene. 

Could probably be because I'm a high school dropout, but it isn't my fault I was just to smart for school so I became a failure. Right? I'm clearly just another victim of a failed system. 

Anywho, somewhere along the lines of wanting to please my father as well as still become successful I came to the final conclusion (and oddly enough still the only thing I'd even consider school for now) of what I wanted to be. I was an extremely nervous nelly when I told my pops, I didn't care about anyone else's opinion on what I'd decided but his and fuck did he shoot me down instantly. Please note, my father was not a douche he just knew me at the time at least better than myself at the time. I had cornered him and explained to him that I was going to be a mechanic, to be more specific a mechanic specialising in classic car restoration. 

It met all his 'demands', schooling I could get financial assistance with and residing in the same state. I'd even did my research and discovered the top rated trade school for car restoration is in my state. I'd thought I'd done all my research and would make my dad proud along with learning the skill of cars so we had something to bond over and do together. I mean, I still play with Hot Wheels so it's only logical I work on cars for a living. 

'That is the absolute worst idea I've ever heard. Do you know how lazy you are? Do you even realise how quickly you get bored with stuff? Oh, and not to mention you're almost 18 and have literally never fucking touched a car other to start it or wreck it. I'm not going to support such a stupid idea, you'll never make it and end up living with your mom and I forever. Maybe try fast food or retail?'

I shit you not, my dad rudely and bluntly shut down my dreams and pretty much told me I was to lazy and sheltered to do anything beyond minimum wage. Great parenting, ugh. I just wanted his approval and a hobby we could call ours dammit. Plus he had two classic cars that I could help him professionally restore with my smarts. 

My dads harshness to me that day kind of scared me from pursuing anything really. I just wasn't meant for higher learning is all I figured at my young age. I made an active effort after that to help my dad with the cars more, flex my knowledge and show him he was wrong. 

He died before I got the chance. He noticed my efforts, and eventually told me he didn't think I could hack it because cars are becoming fucking complicated with their computers and shit, to which he couldn't be able to help me if I needed it like I wanted when deciding that path. 

Besides having someone else put the transmission in my car that I inherited from my papa, I have done all the work to my own cars in the past 6 years. Before my dad passed away I only got to hold hoods up when he needed the help, he taught my brother how to do car basics because the garage is apparently where dudes belong but not chicks? Sexist much? Kidding. We already know by this point in the story he had his own insecurities he tried to hide from me while simultaneously crushing my average blue collar dreams. 

Since my father has passed I've experienced everything he tried his hardest to shelter me from, always ending up on top. Tripping and stumbling there but there none the less. But, also in losing him I lost my own personal mechanic and had his mindset of refusing to let anyone touch my shit. So, if a car broke down it was my issue. 

The very dream that was crushed prematurely, is quite possibly my only passion besides drugs now. I know more about cars than anyone I've talked to other than an actual mechanic my ex lived with, lol. I tend to avoid discussing such interests with people because my generation seems to hate hands on jobs or subjects about them. However, I have managed to keep my cars running, often ghetto rigging them just because I fucking could, kept my mother's cars running but she is a horrible car owner so I just let those die, I also have kept a couple friends cars running. All with the limited knowledge I've heard from my father and brother in passing. 

Oddly enough, even with my lack of legit book learning knowledge when I work on cars is the only time I feel alive. Nothing else challenges me like those puzzles. Idk what I'm doing, but they always manage to start up again and keep running. So its obviously my calling, right? 

Ah, now reality I didn't pursue anything I'd ever dreamed of being and now I work factory jobs long hours to support a drug problem to mask the struggles and to cure boredom. At least I don't have debt from school and can buy more drugs, silver lining y'all. 

If you made it this far, tbh I kept typing more so to keep thinking about my daddy than to feed the tweaker need to type. I miss my dad more than anything in life and it was oddly therapeutic typing about him. And despite this story of him possibly having questionable parenting skills/morals he was the best dad ever hence why I didn't know how scary and full of struggle the real world is. He still prepared me though, so fuck yeah.

We'd made a business deal and I was supposed to be up and waiting at 9am for him. Talked to him at 8am and he said he had to go pick up some stuff and he'll be at my spot. Then suddenly all the calls after were with his girl who kept saying another half hour and call back. This went on a few hours. 

I had no money, I didn't hustle shit today because I was supposed to fucking wake up to 50 snaps (beans) so why even hustle with that deal on the horizon? 

Yeah, he got into a car wreck and got picked up because dealers be always running from the police. 

He told me if I get to him he got me, but my other dude just brought me shit (fucker gave me clear testers so be ready for Berry to hit like a wrecking ball soon y'all)!

So now, here I sit though waiting on a miracle because he said our deal is still on its just a matter of connecting. He rideless, and I'm trying to sweet talk family members off their cars. I'm almost positive I got a car lined up, for fucking tomorrow. Ugh. 

I AM NOT SUCKING MY DEALER OFF OR EVEN FUCKING HIM SO NOBODY THINK THAT IS THE DEAL. 

But, considering I'm no longer hiding a car (rip to my fucking SUV I'll never forget you) I have an empty garage and give no fucks what goes on in it. Ahaha, just realised it sounds like I gave the okay for a meth lab to be built in my garage. Still nope! 

This is just another sign I need to quit. I literally do it now out of boredom, like I literally wake up full of energy and not even looking for my next fix. But then it appears on my counter and I'm all like, 'fuck it, ain't got shit to do today Imma get high!'

I'm curious for those that have done this or know more about it what the rush is like? I've heard it has a nice mild rush and has a better half-life as well. What I don't understand is if the Bupe causes an opiate feeling upon injection why doesn't the Naloxone put the user into precipitated withdrawal or something? Is there any way to get the Nalaxone out of these? Also are these known to cause abcesses?

My family had no idea how to deal with it, they wanted me to go to rehab, but i couldnt go because my girlfriend of 3 years had no idea how bad my problem had gotten, i couldnt let her find out like this. This was rock bottom for me.

So I loaded up with kratom, and I fucking beat it (I had tried and failed 6-7 times before). And I worked my serving job at Olive Garden during the whole thing. I struggled through each day, went home and smoked copious amounts of weed so that I could sleep for an hour each night. And I woke up the next day, and I fucking beat it again. Wash, Rinse, Repeat. It sucked for a week. It was the worst week of my life.

But then, things starting getting better. I went on a drive on the Parkway in NC where I'm from and cried listening to music and looking at nature because I truly saw how beautiful things were again. I felt a calming in my soul once the physical symptoms stopped. I woke up and felt good again. I started to remember what it was like before I had let my life get in this situation. Life was starting to get GOOD again. I took it day by day, I had rough days, REALLY rough days when my dealer would hit me up telling me he had good deals, but I wouldnt let myself do it again.

Now here I am, over 6 months later. I've moved to Washington, DC with my girlfiend, I am getting in the best physical shape of my life, and I just accepted a job making $70,000/year. My life is getting back on track. I feel amazing, I feel better than I ever did during the last 3 years of my life. I'm starting to love life again, I'm beginning to get excited about my future again. I'm learning to live life sober again. And its beautiful to me.

I guess I just want everyone thats struggling the way that I struggled to know that it does and it will get better. I know it sounds cliche, and you're at a place where you don't think that it can. I was there. I lived there. And now I am happy again. It's amazing how much our bodies can rebound from abuse and get back to where they were before. My mind is clear, I am happy, I am free.

I'm here to help you. PM me. Comment on here. I'll do my best, I'll help you with what worked for me. I'll do anything to help someone get out of the dark, lonely place that I was in. There is hope on the other side of this, I PROMISE YOU. And I hope everyone here gets to see that day.",1504101792.0

I'm not talking speedballs per se, more shooting either on their own. I don't have access to a needle exchange and the packs of needles I can get from my local pharmacy only contain needles, alcohol wipes and a sharps bin.

Ive been shooting coke a couple times a week for the last couple of months or so and have had no bad consequences (*touch wood*) from using tap water and occasionally using a cotton bud/q-tip head as a filter.

Firstly, I know with shooting heroin you need to draw it up through some kind of filter first but does this need to be done with uncut cocaine (by uncut I mean not repressed or cut with benzocaine/whatever else they use) as I have IVd cocaine without filtering and I was fine. Ive also drawn it up through the head of a cotton bud/q-tip again with no problems.

Secondly, what is the best filter to use for cocaine or heroin injection? Is the head of a cotton bud/q-tip good enough?

Lastly, is it a bad thing that I use regular tap water to mix my shots? Again I dont have access to a needle exchange and I dont know where else I can get those ampuoles of sterile water other than from onion sources.

So I want to lower my tolerance. The past 3 days, I've used 150 gram, then 130 grams and today I made a nasty smoothie from 100 grams of ground poppy. I feel noddy like I used to - have I already lowered my tolerance or is it just because I'm getting more out of ingesting the poppies rather than making tea? Ingesting it gives me a stomach ache in such high doses. I used to be able to ingest 20 grams without problems when that was enough. Anyways, anybody have any tips for lowering tolerance? Should I do a quicker taper? Planning on going down 10-20 grams per day. I have a tramadol prescription, I sometimes use those when the poppies doesnt quite do it for me by themselves.

Part of me wonders if a piece of the puzzle in the current ""opioid epidemic"" is a lack of purpose. Speaking for myself, when i am at my worst  with using i am generally in a mindset of nihilism - nothing matters any ways and everything is pointless... so why not feel good? Being strung out in some sick sense gave me purpose. Until i found something that gave me more fulfillment than dope, a higher purpose in life, it always was so much harder to put down the needle.

I also watched Montage of Heck, the Kurt Cobain documentary that HBO produced. That was another Amazing movie that gave you a glimpse with his struggle with addiction and his depression.

I had my reservations they were in thier early 20's and thought they were way more cool than they were. Posting dumb snap chats of themselves with a few hundred dollars like they were some sort of rapper with a few hundred thousand. They told stories of how they were involved with ripping people off and I should have listened to myself and stayed away from them. Two of the three I stopped spending time with and only hung out with one of them who seemed the best friend material. 

  He pretended too be my friend and worked up a decent debt, every other day he'd call me up sick and acting all buddy buddy only to get high and start acting like a douche bag clown wanna be white rapper. I don't know why I let him work up over $500 but I felt terrible for him being sick and he did pay back chunks of the debt but it never was paid in whole. I brought him food and genuinely was a good person and friend and he also sort of returned the favor helping clean my house and car a few times. He introduced me to his mom stating how I was his best friend and one of the best people he'd been friends with and I had gained trust with him. He was supposed to pay me back in whole before his mom left town and just pulled the biggest asshole move anyone's played on me. 

All of a sudden he moves across town and that day just stops responding to any texts or calls. I immediately suspected he had decided to keep all the cash for himself and cut ties but gave him two days of worried texts and calls trying to make sure he was alive.  I had been worried about this ever since he mentioned that he was moving and was right unfortunately. He won't say a word to me it really pissed me off and I was ready to hunt him down and beat his skinny ass until he cried for mercy. I'm much larger than him and it would have been a cake walk but it just didn't seem right, also from my own experience these things come back and do more harm to whoever pulled the crime anyways. 

  He also posted on Facebook that basically he's a bad ass who ignores who he wants to and is trying to focus on himself, I've seen this shit as a excuss why a few people have been burned latly and I don't understand how people can justify burning genuine friends who went out of their way to help them because thier all of a sudden going to better themselves. Sounds like another start to a failed attempt to kick dope or just a excuss to be a total asshole.  

  I understand strait up ripping someone off with fake dope or short bags is not right but it should only happen once before the problem is solved. But to pretend to be somones friend has got to be the lowest of low ways to play someone. It's just beyond me to ever think of doing this to somone, what a waste of flesh and life. I hope he changes before its to late and he just dies a scumbag going strait to hell where people like that belong. 

  Watch out for this younger generation my experience has shown me lots of zero respect snakes only out for themselves. Not saying is everyone but there's more scumbags than ever.   Don't loan money to anyone who's using its just as terrible idea, if someone is really your friend they wont expect you to do anything for them but be a friend. 

  Also the dudes raps were absolutely terrible, I really want to post the YouTube videos for a good laugh but that wouldn't be right to put him on blast like that. He tried playing them to some black people and they just turned it off before the song was half over, It was embarrassing. It just was a bunch of nonsense about money and stuff he just doesn't have any of and wont have any of.  People like that really need a good ass kicking to knock them down a peg or two and get them back to reality and get them to stop shaming thier familys. Drug abuse is one thing but being a complete tool who's entirely out of touch with who they're is inexcusable.  That's the last time I help anyone out who's like that. 

  One more thing he couldn't control his use at all, would shoot everything he had knowing he'd be sick the next day claiming he needed to feel it. He'd just be a useless sleeping douche with the intelligence of stupid middle schooler afterwards. Id try and get him to slow down but the next thing you know he's preparing his fourth shot that hour spilling half of it on his nasty tabel he never cleaned. Kinda a hopeless case I've really never seen somone so stupid, trying to suck up spilled shots off a disgusting coffee table and giving himself some nasty parasite in the process.  Hope he really gets help but the last 6 month rehab stay he did only kept him sober two days once he was out which is really sad. Careful who you trust added stress is somthing none of us need and sorry for the huge story. Also don't be that tool the world really doesn't need anymore of them.   ",1504065164.0

I have seen many a drainage and so has my bf and neither of us could believe the flowage quantity and length of duration from which it was expelling itself. I went through 2 boxes of non stick gauze, 1 pack of regular gauze and a box of wiping gauze and then had to use a towel. As soon as I'd wipe that nastiness away another puddle would form and flow if I wasn't fast enough. And it was thick with the occasional black specs.

Just a little more tired than normal. 

However, im an emotional wreck. My dopamine and serotonin receptors are screaming at me. ""Fuck you, you fucking dumb asshole!"" They are very angry. How did we let this happen, other me?

 I worry for myself. My parents can see it in my face now too. ""What are you on now?"", my dad asks as i pace around outside in circles, 24 hrs since my dose. He knows i havent slept in over a day. They think im a downers guy exclusively so i say ""if i had taken anything, i wouldve slept""... great answer, huh... he's figured it out im sure. 

My feelings are hurt by that which shouldnt even phase me. I want to cry, but im too numb still.

Not even depression. That happens for no clear reason. I know why im sad. Downregulation of feel good chemicals in my brain but also, most of all, utter loneliness. Why do i feel so alone when so many people say theyre here for me? They're all just pixels on a screen at the end of the day. Until you find that special case which isnt.

So I got 2g of BTH, but I'm not getting the desired effect. I'm knew to BTH, so any pointers would be helpful.

In terms of smoking it, I broke off a good size chunk maybe .20g or .25g and put it on foil (not the shiny side). Since the gear is hard, I put no more than one or two drops of water on it. Then I used a pen to move it around the foil to deposit a small think layer of the mixture. Then I would put a hollow pen in my mouth and keep it close to the surface of the foil while holding the lighter beneath the foil trying to not get the lighter too close, and inhaling the trails.

I probably took ten good hits and still didn't feel awesome. So then I took another piece and crushed it up. Since I saw some people mention that bth is the base form of H and not the salt form, it needs to be mixed with an acid, so I mixed the crushed up H with some vitamin C powder and railed it.

And then when someone needs me to hook them up or I came into some money, I have to drag my sweaty, pale, dehydrated, no energy ass out into this 112° heat and get on a bus (50% of their A/C doesn't work) where my abcesses are getting bounced around in a hard ass seat and then wait for what feels to be forever for my Mexican friend to find me. You'd think ""cool at least I can do a quick shot and get some relief?"" But not quite... If I take the quick shot then I have to try to not be conspicuous in the public bathroom and because I've been so sick and dehydrated, my shakey hands can't find a vein that isn't covered in some kind of scary tissue. So I end up IM it and it's a waste as most of you know. 

I sit and cry for this destructive proverbial wheel of hell that I am on. It's like I like punishing myself and here's a prime example (besides my bth habit) my fiance gave me the money to go to the clinic for the week and what did I do with the money? I gambled it! Why in the fuck did I do that? Self sabotage obviously, but is it that subconsciously I don't want to quit or wtf?!? 

The one good thing I did do however was get my script of antibiotics filled. So finally I can fight this infection that is my body. Hopefully it will kill the baby abcesses and prematurely kill these elderly abcesses. ",1504027132.0

We could set up BTC mining rigs to generate income. If we make large enough of a mining rig we could totally make ourselves self sufficient legally with BTC.

During that time clean I met someone that quickly became my best friend. I started to learn to love her so very fast. 

Now let me preface this by saying I've never been interested in relationships in the past.. I thought I would never be able to accept love because I was too fucked up and flawed.. on top of being a raging drug addict.. 

This past summer we've gotten so close and I started falling in love with her. Now she came from a very abusive relationship before this that I helped her through and she was eternally grateful for me saving her from that. I love this girl so much. Anyways, she started falling for me during this period of us together as well and I've never felt like this before for another person.. 

She went off away to college (her 4th year, decided to transfer) about 45 minutes away from. She's been telling me how in love she is with me and that I'm her best friend but subliminally telling me how she's still not ready to be committed. Last night she told me she couldn't do it anymore and that it needed to end because she can't handle commitment right now and guys I just feel so low and broken. 

I'm realizing love is as powerful as fucning heroin was for me and now that I feel like I'm losing her I'm physically in pain and my heart hurts so bad. I just took a little xanax to calm myself down and maybe eat some Kratom but fuck if I don't feel god awful.

All I can think of about is sayin fucj it and going to cop some shit again but I might be so disappointed in myself later. Help convince me I'm just being a little bitch.


TLDR : best friend girl broke my heart and telling me she wanted to be with me because she's not ready to commit after abusive relationship and doesn't know what will happen in college. I'm a wreck, relapse or no relapse?",1504192915.0

I'm not even going to bother posting a pic, suffice to say it looks like cocaine with very hard little chunkies of the same color as the powder interspersed in it. The white shit is obviously fenty more often than not, but what I've been getting has been a bit different.

First of all, it has that sweet taste to it. No notes of vinegar whatsoever. Fent indicator right there, correct? Well, thats where the similarity to fent stops with this ish. 

It has a pronounced euphoria, and is so strong that several small bumps has me feeling as good as even a half gram of some ECP that ive gotten in the past. 

It also has the longest legs of any ""dope"" ive sniffed to date. It literally keeps me well for 18+ hours, and that includes no yawning or bitchtears until about hour twenty. It also makes my pupils smaller than any other shit ive gotten, like pinprick pupils are no hyperbole with this shit.

 Additionally it gives me insane heat intolerance, to the point where on some of the hotter summer days a few weeks ago I would have to go into the office bathroom and take like a sink shower to cool off. 

Lastly, it gives me [what I imagine to be] crystal meth levels of energy. Opiates do usually give me a lot of energy, but not like this. One day I was power walking home from the subway so vigorously that the next day my shins were swollen and in agony. Overall, 10/10 buzz. My guy charges $120 for a ""gram"" of it instead of his usual $100, but its really worth at least 2-3 times the value of a regular sack. 

Welp, those are the best clues I could come up with. Can any of yall opiate pros connect the dots and speculate what sort of drug I might be dealing with here? Thanks much,  fam.

I know its not ""ancient"" history, but a couple of mine are Howard Hughes and Kurt Cobain.

-Howard Hughes; Howard fucking LOVED his opiates! Im going off the top of my head here so please bear with me and feel free to correct me if im wrong. After crashing (he crashed a few times) an experimental spy plane and severely injuring himself, Mr. Hughes was introduced to opiates. I believe he favored codeine, but I m sure he messed around with other stuff. He was the RICHEST man in the world at the time and had specific mormon servants/assistants devoted to ensuring he had a stable supply of his drugs! I would bet Mr. Hughes may even have NEVER been dope sick! At the time of his death (if your one of the suckers who believed he really died! In fact what happened was he moved back to Las Vegas and took the name Mr. House, eventually obtaining immortality UNTIL YOU SIDED WITH THE NCR or even worse yes man!!!!) they found numerous needles that had broken off in his body! If your not to familiar with Howard, IM SORRY I MEAN MR. Hughes, I HIGHLY recommend learning about him. He had a very interesting life to say the least!

So this past month has been a fucking whirlwind man, i mean brutal at times. Two friends and The last girl that i loved, all gone. Some times you never really entertain the thought of loosing someone so close to you like that, maybe i just never wanted to. But i feel like this is the only place that I can really convey entirely how i feel and i need to just get it all out i think.

So maybe ill just write a little about each person, ill try not to give any sort of details of that person so that they could be identified or something. 

The first one that i heard about was a friend who moved away from his hometown down south to get away from his killer, and ended up staying much longer than expected. I actually remember the time he convinced his boss to hire me where he worked and then quit the very next day, i didnt know how the fuck to feel about that one haha. but i didnt make it there much longer either, i bounced after i got my first paycheck we went to go and get high as usuall and he actually had talked me up to asking out the girl who cashes checks at Publix. She shot me down off the rip but he never did laugh at me, not once. He was allways good to people like that. Once he moved back home he ended up falling in love himself, they used together until they found out they were pregnant and both got clean. After the baby was born and she had healed up she left to go get high and overdosed. He never really talked much after that, i couldnt imagine what he was going through, but i did  understand. Things only got worse from there, when she left this world it took the most of him too i beleive. I never heard mugh from his after that, a few facebook posts here and there but i found out he had went up missing for a few days and i thought the worst, but he ended up coming home in shambles and entering into a rehab program. Then next thing i know i start seeing the dreaded tagged R.I.P posts. It fucked me up man, nobody deserves to go out like that. Ill allways love you buddy, and i still have that ""ugly 6.0 hat that you never liked"" I miss you.

Its had to say that one death of someone you love impacts you more than another, its like the old favorite child concept, except darker than any hue of black. But this one, this one ripped me open and made me, let me correct that, makes me feel absolutely at a loss of words and breath. I loved her, I loved her more then i ever let her know. And im horribly sorry for that. I still remember her showing me the movie Dope and her thinking it was the best thing to happen to cinema. I remember all the time that she put into getting the perfect amount of Parmesan into the meatballs, i remember how walking next to her made me feel so happy that i could have walked around the globe right then and there with her and never thought twice about it. But unfortunately i also remember How fragile my sobriety was at that time, and the first time her hand was swollen from ""accidentally shutting it into the door"", how i wouldnt hear from her for a half a day and then all of sudden id get a full page text with every thought she wanted to write when she was sick but just now had the will and words to express it. I remember falling asleep next to her completely naked and her being so warm and then waking up next to what felt like a refrigerator. 

I still feel incredibly shitty about how everything happened at the end. Deep down inside myself i knew if i stayed with her any longer I was going to end up using again. I wish i wasnt so absolute about everything right then. I had tried to convince her to get into a program or go to treatment, but it never came to fruition, so one day i woke up early and gathered my things, gave her one last kiss on the forehead and walked away. Deep down ive allways justified what that what i did was the right thing to do, and eventually the open wound that was our love had started to scab over. 
It was two weekends ago that i heard you passed away, and the news leaves me with my stomach in shambles, thoughts still scattered, and the lack of my own words menacing in my mouth. You allways knew how little i actually needed to use my inhaler, but i dont think reaching for it right now will help me find relief. I still imagine your hair running throught my hair and you telling me its cool even if i do go bald, i got you boo, and then giggling and giving me a kiss. Maybe the words that im typing out now would have given you the closure that i never gave you, because i could write a million and i dont beleive they would even begin to                           ",1504153219.0

Yeah those idiots","The question is frequently asked: Why does a man become a drug addict?
The answer is that he usually does not intend to become an addict. You don’t wake up one morning and decide to be a drug addict. It takes at least three months’ shooting twice a day to get any habit at all. And you don’t really know what junk sickness is until you have had several habits. It took me almost six months to get my first habit, and then the withdrawal symptoms were mild. I think it no exaggeration to say it takes about a year and several hundred injections to make an addict.

The questions, of course, could be asked: Why did you ever try narcotics? Why did you continue using it long enough to become an addict? You become a narcotics addict because you do not have strong motivations in the other direction. Junk wins by default. I tried it as a matter of curiosity. I drifted along taking shots when I could score. I ended up hooked. Most addicts I have talked to report a similar experience. They did not start using drugs for any reason they can remember. They just drifted along until they got hooked. If you have never been addicted, you can have no clear idea what it means to need junk with the addict’s special need. You don’t decide to be an addict. One morning you wake up sick and you’re an addict. (Junky, Prologue, p. xxxviii)",1504146402.0

Long-time user (of both heroin and this subreddit) here, with a *fun* and *exciting* story (complete with a follow-up question) for anyone who's smarter than I am, which, admittedly, is not a very high bar to begin with.     

I've been using heroin for about 3 years now, and in all that time, the absolute worst thing to happen was a missed shot / accidentally IV'ed into an artery. I've never had any actual health problems (that I'm aware of) which stemmed from using. However, about two weeks ago, I noticed that right after a (big) shot, I started to feel kind of... weird. My brain felt fuzzy, foggy, hazy. Then, about 5 minutes after injecting, *it* began.     

I was walking to the bedroom when my legs **suddenly and completely** gave out on me. It felt as if I had (out of nowhere) lost *total* control over *every* muscle in my body. It *also* felt like I had just been struck by lightning. I fell to the floor, unable to catch myself with my hands. I hit my head. It hurt. I had a brief moment afterwards in which I wasn't sure as to what the fuck just happened or how I wound up on the floor. I got up and brushed myself off, all the while incredibly confused. Then, about 20 seconds later, it hit me again. Every last muscle in my body suddenly tightened and then relaxed, sending me to the floor once again like a sack of heroin-infused potatoes. This time, instead of standing back up, I decided to sit with my legs crossed. Another 20 seconds later, my upper body felt as if it was flung backwards, my legs quickly straightened, then went limp, and my arms flailed forward. It felt as if I had either dislocated my left shoulder or tore my rotator cuff, idk because neither of those things have ever actually happened to me, but my shoulder was radiating an intense pain, regardless of whether I tried moving it or not.     

Next, I tried crawling so as to reduce the potential for contracting a head injury or concussion. Every 20 seconds, though, I'd fall again and again as I began to mentally freak the ever-loving fuck out. The seizure continued, wave after wave, for a grand total of about 20 minutes. Each wave brought with it a very brief, momentary lapse in consciousness. It felt like my memory of the past second or two was wiped clean each time. My left shoulder *still* hurts like hell every time I try to move it. For the next two weeks, after a shot, I'd experience a very mild version of the above. I say that it was mild because I'd only drop (more like accidentally throw) my phone or cigarette, whatever was in my hands at the time. Instead of falling, I'd merely studder-step. My brain felt the exact same way as it did when the first seizure happened -- foggy, fuzzy, hazy -- but my body wasn't reacting nearly as violently. Slowly, over the course of those two weeks, it grew more and more mild each time. For the past two or three days, actually, it hasn't happened at all.     

Fast forward to about one hour ago (yes, we're going forward from the past, some Back to the Future-type shit). I did a pretty hefty, almost suicidal amount of dope. Shortly after, that too-familiar feeling swept over my brain. Fuzzy. Foggy. Hazy. I fell on a few occasions but didn't hit my head this time. I re-injured my left shoulder, which was already in a lot of pain.     

So, can anyone tell me if this is normal? I mean, I know it's not *normal*, but is it at least not unheard of? Should I seek any sort of medical attention? And if so, what kind of attention? Are we talking ""go see your primary care physician"" medical attention? Or do I need the full-blown ""get your ass to the ER"" kind of attention? I'm *terribly* sorry for the massive wall of text, but I felt as though every little detail might hold some degree of importance.

So my wife obviously doesn't know I'm using.   Not banging any more but finding a place to smoke is hard.   Last night really want to smoke but she was home.   I loaded up a small peice on foil got in the shower but pointed the shower head down and did my thing.   Call it junky inginuity.  You guys loyal to the foil got any good tricks to incognito smoking?  ,1504122549.0

Had to kind of psych myself up to go in and actually tell a Dr. the truth for once.

Lo and behold.... I go there half an hour early to fill out the paperwork and the doctor decided to take today off. So now you guys get to deal with drunk odb for almost another week.

Can anyone send narcan?,"As some of you may know, hubs and I had moved to the north eastern part of the US recently due to his many sudden medical problems. ..we came to stay with his mother, who is a fucking disgusting pig and sorry excuse for a mother, we just had nowhere else to go bc we lost wages and our apartment during his almost 6 month hospital stay......about 2 weeks ago his mother and I got into a fist fight and I ended up staying at a local battered women's shelter...ANYWAY... last night I copped some dope, and then snuck into his mom's house to hang out with him and do said dope... well... he ODd... FUCK... I had to call 911 bc we don't have narcan (anyone who could send some my way would literally be a life saver) needless to say his mother found out I was there...before her son was even breathing again she was telling the police to arrest us both! Now today she's kicking him out (he's disabled and the shelters won't take him bc he can't work for them) and she's gone to get fucking protection orders against us *rolls eyes* ...I am SO GRATEFUL THAT HE'S ALIVE!!! However, just like any od, this was the LAST thing we needed...I don't know what the hell were going to do! I'm on a smoke break at my new job and have to go in now...but may edit or post more later...just really needed to tell SOMEONE about this horrific situation",1504115129.0

When I was using I justified it by telling myself I can keep using as long as I'm doing well at work and not spending my entire paycheck on drugs.
