I'm going to run out before this month's refill. That means awful Opana WD and possibly having issues with the clinic I go to. Dad and I live several states apart but have never lost a bit of our closeness. We speak on the phone frequently. It's good to have someone who knows EXACTLY what you're going through with chronic pain, especially when it's close family. I finally broke down on the phone and told him what's going on (not quite the full extent; he doesn't need to know I'm already in WD. Knowing my Dad he could tell just by the way I sounded, though).

What does my awesome Dad do?

Immediately offer to get 12 in the mail to me Friday night before the post office closes so I will have them by Monday. I'll be mailing some of mine back up to him so he won't miss his pill count and he'll be saving me from the special hell that is WD. I was bawling my eyes out on the phone thanking him, telling him ""you don't have to do this, I've gone through WD before, I don't want to fuck up your pill count"" and his only response was ""I love you, and I'm your Dad, I'm not going to let you hurt if I can help it.... now please let me get off the phone so I can get these to you"".

So now I'm just waiting for the mail to get here on Monday. I'm learning that WD is easier to handle when you know you'e got something coming to you. I feel much more relaxed and much more able to internalize the idea that this feeling isn't going to last forever (or even a full 10 days like my WD usually do). He'll never see it but thanks for the rescue Dad. I owe you one. <3 

tl;dr Dad saves the day from several states away",1516546456.0

Population: Ireland 4.6m    U.S. 320.9m  Approx 70x

Opiate deaths Ireland 2015: 86 Methadone, 82 Heroin, 7 fent

Opiate deaths U.S. 2015: 33,091

The difference is startling. I know ideally I would like to measure opiate users rather than population but it was not possible. Regardless the difference is phenomenal. 

I dont know if its because we have no culture of oxy type drugs, fent is rare here, naloxone is freely available to addicts, methadone is free to any opiate addict and there is a range of harm reduction services free of charge. The difference is frightening though.",1516546435.0

Cleaning up.,"I just smoked the last gram of BTH i had. I plan on cutting out opiates and cleaning up.  I had been using oxy for years and about a month or so ago made the switch to heroin.  I can honestly say I much prefer oxy... personally think the high is much better and I stay high longer. I have been planning my detox and this for awhile and have acquired a lot of stuff I hope will stave most of my withdrawals. I have one strip of suboxone, an ounce of Kratom, gabapebtin, clonidine, hydroxizine, and tramadol. I also just got put on my family's LA Fitness membership. I was wondering how I should take the meds. I plan on cutting up the suboxone... how long should I wait to take the first piece? I was thinking maybe about 12-24 hours from now and how should I divy out the other meds? I know the Kratom has to build up in our system in order to work so should I maybe start taking 2 capsules about 8 hours from now then continue with 2 capsules every four hours until this time tomorrow then increase to 4 capsules? As for the gym I plan on going to the sauna and maybe sweating out the toxins to maybe make the withdrawal process go faster? Then set a solid routine for working out... last time I got clean routine was everything... I think working out will help me tremendously in mood and general well being. I realize this is a shit post and we see at least a hundred a week on this sub but this is my one and only shitpost about getting clean I hope to make. The biggest reason for getting clean is because I am trying to get a job in a hospital/clinic setting and I want to pass my drug test on my own volition... it sucks because most hospitals in my state won't even hire you if you have nicotine in your system. I am also excited to save money. I remember last time I got clean I had more money than I knew what to do with(not really, I went out to eat A LOT) but anyways any advice any of you have for me on how to dole out the meds or any other advice I would greatly appreciate. I love you guys and this sub and admire the regulars on here who are clean and offer advice to others and offer their general input.

Even being a shitty middleman gives you that control and upper hand it's a dog eat dog world and the way to the top is ruthless. How submissive you will be or how willing you are to get to the top is what drives many to do the most disgusting things.

7rwblm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rwblm/5_more_days/,15,https://redd.it/7rwblm,JustWeightOnIt,5 more days,"I’ve been on probation for over 3 years. While I’ve used throughout that time this last year i had to really cut back. the first 2 years while it was only felony Probation so they didn’t really drug test all that much. The only reason i went back to jail was on me. It was because I got arrested for a failure to maintain lane that resulted in a wreck. I had 2 seizures from benzo WD so I got kicked out of jail. Did a little over a month (3 for 1 since I was a trustee) for that. 

Anyways the last year I was on misdemeanor and in my county those people don’t fuck around. Drug tests started at twice a month. Well I failed the first one for xanax (rx’d), pot, and alcohol. They saw my script for the xanax and let that slide but they still wanted to lock me back up for the pot and booze. I ended up running away to rehab for 3 months and the judge let me off with a warning. Then I missed a test on accident (I just forgot to call in) and he bumped my testing up to once a week.

About a couple months ago they found oxy in my system. That’s because the original tests they used looked for “opiates” which really meant anything that breaks down in to morphine. I figured that out before they did and kept using until the pulled the old switcheroo without telling me. She (my PO) called me and told me she was gonna revoke the rest of my time (like 6 months). I was freaking out until I got my prescription list from my pharmacy and saw I had a script of oxy 5s from a wisdom tooth extraction a year prior to all this. I told her I had oxys for an ongoing pain that I needed surgery to fix but since I was in school i didn’t have the time. She fucking believed me! 

So I continued to pop oxys a handful of times the last couple months. I did do some speedballs a couple months back but that was once the day after a drug test so I knew I would Be clean the next test because they reduced the amount to twice a month. 

So that brings me to today, 5 days away from being put on non report (no testing, no monthly meetings, NO MORE PAYMENTS — $50 per meeting and $35 for each drug test) and guys/girls I couldn’t be happier. I’ll probably cut back on the oxy consumption and pick up some high quality Mary Jane and some extracts(my girlfriend just bought a $4000 piece to smoke from and I still have my mothership) I might have a couple beers as well to top it all off. I’m so glad I don’t have to rely on oxys to get a buzz when I want.

the real risk people are overlooking is hitting your head if you fall down - i have done that multiple times as well as down the staircase twice, in a classroom once, and twice while i was driving where i wrecked into guardrails on the interstate going 50-60 mph. both times i hit the windshield with my head and cracked it as well as concussing myself unconcicous. i would of defiinitely died and went thru the windshield had i not worn a seatbelt but i always do wear one thank god.

We have had a mutual understanding that if any of our friends were going through a hard time, we'd give them a place to crash and help them out. 

There's an old friend of the bf's, let's call him Bill. He used to do dope, but has been clean for a few years. Bill has had a rough time in life for the past three years. His long term gf left him, and ever since can't keep a place to live, even though he works as a bartender in a major city five nights a week. What few teeth he's got are not looking good. He's skinny and puffy faced. 

Bill told the bf that the apartment he'd been staying in was locked shut by the marshall because the person he'd been paying rent to had taken the money and skipped town. Bill is supposedly sleeping at the bar a few times a week after his shift. He sometimes shows up at 2am, or sometimes shows up at 10am and then goes up to the the attic space where we have a spare bed and crashes up there all day.

The second night he crashed here, he stayed up there for 15 hours. He came down to pee, I chatted with him briefly but he cut that short, saying he had to get going and try to get his stuff out of the apartment somehow. He went back up to the attic, and.... there was silence for the following hour and a half. Then he came back down and said he'd fallen back asleep. He went out, traveled over an hour all the way to his work to see if he was needed (instead of just calling?) and then came back two hours later.

A different night he left our apartment at 5am because he said he couldn't sleep, and didn't return for a day or two.

Bill came by two days ago and smelled like a homeless person. No exaggeration. It wasn't normal BO or staying in the same clothes for a few days. It was intense. It was the kind of smell that people get off the bus to avoid. I don't understand how he can even be allowed to work like that. I understand that he doesn't have access to his clothes and whatnot, but he can borrow something of my bf's, and we have a washing machine in my building. Or, fuck, why not clean your shit in the sink, even?!

Nothing about this guy doesn't scream full blown ""junkie"" to me. He doesn't hang out with the bf when he's here, he just goes up to the attic.  

For the past week and change he's been claiming that he's getting sick. Some kind of flu. 

I've spoken to my bf about my concerns, but he's firmly on the side of optimism. He could be sleeping a lot because of depression. He might be getting sick because he's sleeping at his work. 

Tonight Bill told me he kept waking up more and more sick. He's got a fever. I ordered us food, he said he'd like soup. When it arrived, he decided against eating and went back upstairs. 

I do not want to put my boyfriend in the position to have to throw his old friend out into the cold. If Bill is struggling with drugs, I would gladly let him stay here to kick, and support him as much as we can. I just had two very close people to me die of overdoses last summer. If I can help someone out of this hell, I will.

But if he's at the point where he can't keep a place to stay, is smelling like a homeless person, and is lying about his situation, that's a dangerous level of addiction to have in my home. I am poor, and can't afford to have anything of mine be hocked for drugs. I wouldn't even take it personally. Being a junkie is like having a demon possess you. He's not going to be in control of his better judgement.

Sorry this is a bit rambly.

What would you suggest as a not shitty way of dealing with this situation? What are some ways I could determine conclusively if drug use is the culprit? What is the best way to approach this? I have gone up to the attic and looked around once, but saw no blood or wax paper. The boyfriend said Bill would probably not shoot, though. There's no vomiting thus far, either. 

I just... I know what it is to feel utterly alone and abandoned, and I don't want Bill to feel that way. But I also don't want to end up in a bad situation.

TLDR; I think I have a junkie crashing with me. He's an old friend of my boyfriend's. What do I do?
_______________

UPDATE: Ok, so now I have proof he's using, as I just went up to the attic to shut off the lights, looked around, and found the orange cap to a hypo. My boyfriend is at work until after midnight, and Bill is supposedly coming back here in the near future, but who knows? fuck.",1516515952.0

I felt like I was finally back to my normal self. Working, having fun with friends, being more social and feeling more confident, not to MENTION actually having money to spend on shit other than pills pills pills.

The following week after I started I decided to take ONE sub every OTHER day. I took one 3 days ago and haven’t taken one since & still have no desire to or any withdrawal symptoms or anything like that. Could it be over? I’m sure in a couple days I’ll know for sure but this process has been pretty easy for me so far. Anyone else have it like that?

The 17th was the last time I had a shot of heroin. It’s been a loooong year and a half but I’m damn proud of myself. And I successfully used pain meds while giving birth to my first child last June, only because I didn’t expect to have a c-section. But, I’m also on deferred disposition and court ordered in sober living. So honestly I’m not sure what’s actually keeping me sober, however I could’ve easily gotten high because my sober house BARELY drug tests. I mean like once a month or two. 

There’s a part of me that really does want to stay clean, but a stronger side that’s telling me I can manage using again. I keep telling myself it was never that bad, and I didn’t use long enough, or my bottom wasn’t low enough. But I don’t have to experience that suffering if I choose not to. My life is pretty fucking good, and if the only thing I’m worrying about now is losing sleep due to a small child then I’ll take it.

I’ve spent the last week on a little oxycodone bender. Had some ancient 5mgs on hand from a surgery, and boredom with my sobriety got the best of me.

I know, FIVE MILLIGRAMS. I even cut em in half most of the time. But I’m very small (5’ and 100lb) and haven’t had any chemical fun, not even a drink, in several months. For the last 6 days, I’ve had between 10-20mg every day, spaced out enough to feel just a bit happier and lighter between waking and bedtime. It was fun!

Today, all day, I’ve had what feels almost exactly like a particularly nasty booze hangover. Stupid, anxious, lethargic, etc.

My question is how long you think this will last? All the info I’m finding online regards higher doses and/or longer-term use, so I’m hoping an expert in here will be able to tell me I’ll be ok come Monday? Would a little tapering help, or just drag this out?

Two years ago my ex od'd and I got an ambulance there immediately and her life was spared. So they decided to take her to the hospital to make sure everything was ok. 
    There was no dope or needles or anything like that around so the cops were pissed and found a box of weed pipes under her couch and decided to take me straight to jail over it. It's seriously some bullshit. I paid a lawyer $1,000 and he got it reduced to a littering ticket instead of just getting it dropped. Fine whatever. I paid him and his job was done and all I had to do was pay the court $150 and it's all good. Well I missed the payment date and my lawyer decides to file a motion to withdraw from my case. He's got my 1,000 bucks and now I'm being charged with whole original charges which were possession of marijuana and paraphernalia even though there wasn't even any weed there. 
I'm just so pissed because I just got out of a 72 hour lockdown over it and now have to start the whole trial again. I'm gonna use a different lawyer this time and hopefully just get it dismissed. Its fucked because they even wrote in the report that I didn't live there and the box wasn't in plain sight either. How am I the one responsible for those pipes? There's not even proof I was using other then just being there I guess. 

TLDR: saved someone's life from an od in their own home and subsequently went to jail for their weed pipes.

So  I've been pretty fucking broke as of late. Not because of drugs, per se but life in general. Expensive family illnesses (plural) no hours at work, etc. I've taken up begging from time to time - not highway offramp with a sign sort of begging but asking folks at gas stations and other places in town.

I've undertaken this several times now, in various states of dress and with various stories - most bullshit and some 100% true and can tell you guys what worked and what didn't.

None of this should be a surprise to any of you but the better you dress the better the payout, or rather, the higher the frequency of payout. The worse you dress/appear the worse your returns will be, regardless of your story.

I usually use the gas storyline:

""Hey *really* sorry to bother you (look really, REALLY embarrassed and **super** uncomfortable) but I just called my wife and after calling me an idiot, (insert chuckle) told me that I left my wallet at home next to the front door on the little table and now I'm stuck here with no way to get home and I live about 25 minutes away. Do you *happen* to have a few bucks or enough for a gallon or two of gas I could borrow? I'm *extremely* uncomfortable asking like this but I really don't know what else to do.""

It's a pretty good patter, I think, but really misses as much as it hits in regard to actual cash. I've had people put $20 in my tank off of their card, one guy filled my tank entirely which was nice since I'm always out of gas anyway.

Generally I end up with $2-$5 after trolling for quite a while which sucks.

Today I put on black dress slacks, a Polo/Izod shirt with the first button buttoned, white t-shirt underneath and decent shoes.
I immediately felt like I was legitimate. Like, no matter what story I was about to tell was the *truth* because I looked and felt like someone legitimate.

Today's story was this: (I'm changing the career to protect my personal life)

""Hey boss/sir/man/buddy/hon I'm a Network Administrator/Computer guy that is in town working on a company's computer and the owner left for the day and forgot to pay me. The office assistant and I haven't been able to reach her/him for the last couple hours and I'm stuck in town without any gas and live way over in <some-ville>. Can you spare a few bucks so I can get back that way?""

**additional banter**
""I don't think it was intentional, I just think she forgot that she needed to be there when I finished the work.""

""The secretary and I had been trying to reach her for a good couple hours before she had to go home herself and now I'm just freaking stuck here.""

This last banter yielded me $25 in about an hour which was all I was looking for. It felt like an honest situation and the people I pitched it to seemed engaged in the story as well.

I basically dressed for the part. If you look like just an ""Office Joe""/Yuppie type, people are much more likely to feel a sense of camaraderie with you and empathy towards your situation.

I dont know. ..Are you sure you want to get high with me? This shit aint like weed. Itll knock you back and put you on your feet. Leave you grinding your teeth. And sweatin when theres no heat. Girl im a fuck up dont follow my lead.

If you miss one more class their going to drop you from your nursing program. Im not one to judge but, your tolerance is building quick. Last night you took more than me. You stole from your parents that you cherish,  to get high. When you saw me you didnt kiss me, you ran towards my stash. Your getting high everyday with me, girl im a fuck up , dont follow my lead.

Im sorry i have no cash. I cant support two habits. Only mine. Oxy is pricey. Relax stop screaming. Im sorry. Where are you going to go ? Your parents already kicked you out. Girl stay with me please..

I hold you tight all night, because i know youll be gone again as soon as theres light.

If you must get high, slow down, or else youll end up killing yourself. She said , ""its called drug abuse for a reason"".

i havent seen you in a year. I hope your okay. I hope you wear diamonds instead of smoking crystals. I hope the only reason why your using needles now is because you went back to school and became a nurse. I hope the only track marks you see are the ones on the road. I hope your hair grew its color, i hope your skins brighter. The last time i saw you i begged for you to come with me to rehab. I even went a month sober to influence you.

But I got back and am trying to set up my old/customers and old/new plugs. 

Anyways, I got a new connect yesterday that has gunpowder for a great price (I'll get a pic when I get more). I've been sick all day so I was trying to figure something out whether it was middling, borrowing a few dollars, etc. I had a friend call around noon saying if he was able to grab something, he would stop by and help me out. Hours go by and his truck apparently ""broke down"" and couldn't make it. So I'm bummed at this point.

I message a few more people and someone said they would get a little because I needed help. YES! Turns out, she was helping 2 people with this dope. Not only was she getting me well, but a friend of hers had a really bad day due to her boyfriend beating her and then going to jail. So she was stuck outside with her cat & dog dopesick. And the only way my friend would get her to agree to come with her was to get the dope. 

So, she comes and picks me up and my dude doesn't answer....shit. my main guy and his girl live like 2 blocks away from the new guy. So I call the girl and she's waiting for her bf to get home to grab bth because she only has china which my friend doesn't want (smoker). Says she will call as soon as he gets there to meet us. I'm thinking ""fuck, now I'm not gonna get well and I'm gonna get dropped off"".

So we wait while I'm trying to get a hold of my new guy. The girl ends up calling RIGHT WHEN my friend wants to leave. YES!!! 

So she meets us and I get the dope for my friend (BTH). She happened to be cooking up a speedball when I got in the car. This whole time I'm thinking I'll be able to hit t he foil a couple times and that's it (I shoot). I asked her if I could grab a bit of the china to get well (we're actual childhood friends) and she says sure so I grab it from her purse and open it. She says ""hold on"". She had sucked up her 70-80 units and gives me about 30! 

FUCK YES FOR FRIENDS THAT SELL!!!! 

I end up getting a small bit from my friend as well for going with her to get her friend that had the domestic violence issue earlier today. 

Sorry for the long post, but it turned my day around completely. I just wanted to share my only JJ save.

My prescribed dose right now is 320 mg oxycodone extended release and 300 mg oxycodone instant release (yes, I know I could sell those for thousands of dollars each).  

But I need them - I have 7-8 herniated or bulging discs and live my life in sheer agony. The ONLY time I feel even ok are the two hours after I take 3 of my 30 mg instant release oxys. I get no euphoria from the pills or any other positive effect other than pain relief. And that's all I'm looking for here. 

I find myself having come up short on both prescriptions by about a week because of my own stupidity and irresponsibility. If it's being stupid to try to actually fix my f**king pain. My doctor won't prescribe any higher dosage and won't give me any pills early. 

So I'm trying to figure out how to get through the next week without just dying from the pain (and withdrawal). I have some 25 mcg fentanyl patches and might be able to get some 100s. How much, roughly, do you think I'd need to just barely get through a day? Like 150 mcg of fentanyl? More? 

And should I go buy some heroin off the street? I've never done it before, I don't know where to go or what to say to the dealer, or even how much I need. 

ANY help, please, anything at all, is MOST appreciated. I'm utterly desperate. I've put myself in an extremely dire situation, and now I need to know how to figure out how to get through these next 7 days without killing myself from the pain (I won't, really. But it's going to be absolute hell). 

So - how much fentanyl do I need, and should I eat the gel (which I prefer) or smoke it? The actual patch just doesn't work for me, I need a faster and bigger release. 

And should I bother trying to get the fentanyl when I could just go somewhere in my town and buy some heroin? I have money, I can buy what I need, but I'm extremely afraid of getting caught and being put in jail without the drugs I need! Thinking about staying overnight or whatever with nothing - that's truly, truly hell.

What do I say to my soon to be former running partner?,"I'm not quite there yet. I'm getting my photo ID registered this week right after pay day and going in person to register for insurance. I figure by the time I get my ID in the mail, the insurance will be active and I'll be able to get a real prescription for Suboxone.




I still plan to procure dope one last time this week. I'm owed half a bun from Cliff and it ain't coming my way until Friday script day becasue he had to spend all of his money to pay his elecrtic bill after the power got turned off this morning. Which I believe, because it happens a few times a year. I'm planning to buy dope one last time this week, some of it will get loaned to Cliff until script day.


From there I can either count the script as part of my last hurrah or I can trade it with someone else. TBH, I'll inevitably consume the roxies. By that time I'll still have one and a half (12mg total) subs on hand to ensure I don't get sick when I run out. This will also to ensure that I don't feel compelled to buy more dope for lack of subs.

&nbsp;


I'll attempt to get more subs on the street but this pay check is part of the grander plan.


**Phase 1:** Pay fee and register for photo ID at DMV on Friday. Then go to health insurer in person (yeah they have a spot) and try to register for that while waiting for ID to come in the mail.



**Phase 2:** If the insurance is active before I get my photo ID, I'll schedule an appointment with a doctor to get a prescription for subs.


**Phase 3:** Use my new photo ID to pick up my Suboxone script from a real pharmacy.


If my insurance isn't active by my next pay day over two weeks from now, then I'll just spend cold hard cash on the doctor and on the Suboxone script. I'll get a manufacturers coupon to help. By then I'll have my photo ID which is the only major obstacle to gettng subs legally aside from the cost.


Basically, this week should be the last time I buy subs on the street.

&nbsp;


**Now to the question:**

If I ghost on Cliff, he'll eventually begin to persistently try to get in touch with me. He might start with phone calls and texts to my mobile but it won't end there if I don't respond for a couple of days. Early on he'll call my house phone but then he'll ultimately come knocking. 


**When I'm ready to kick because I have a script for subs, I need to tell Cliff something to prevent him from knocking on my front door.**


**What should I say?**

&nbsp;

I ask because I forsee some possible issues. If I say, ""I started seeing a doctor and was prescribed subs."" He'll want me to share some. A couple of months ago when I said I was planning to see a doctor because I Was tired of all the bullshit (spending all of my money on pay day, getting sick because his promises lapsed) he asked me in a worried tone, well practically asserted in a worried tone, ""you are going to share some of those subs when you get them, right?"" 


So you see, if I say that I have a script, he's gonna expect a piece of the action. If the insurance covers the entire cost, I wold still pretend that they cost me a fortune so that I can't be accused of being grimey by not sharing. 

&nbsp;

Perhaps once I have the script locked down I can just honestly tell him, ""I'm out of the game for good and can't share my script because the doctor tests my urine for bupe levels."" I currently cannot predict the outcome of this strategy but I don't think it'll be good if I tell him that I have a script for 30 8mg subs for the month. He knows I never take a full 8mg in any given day. He'll probably say ""I've always shared my roxy srcipt"" but the two free roxies I've recieved every month are payment for me biking to the pharmacy to pick them up. I earned that. Everything else costs me something. 


Maybe I woldn't mind sharing a few subs but I really don't want to set a precedent.

&nbsp;


BRAINSTORM... alternatively I can tell him that I've quit altogether PERIOD. He doesn't need to know I have a Suboxone script. If he tries to tempt me to do dope on the odd day, it won't work anyway I suppose.",1516664384.0

Been on buprenorphine for the past year, very slowly decreasing my dose. Gone from 4mg to 2mg.

Essentially the side effects are getting to me. Ass shredding constipation, drowsiness, that awful numbness with none of the enjoyment of my past use. Just kinda sick of being addicted tbh. But it was always going to be a long term thing, jumping off completely would pbb be a bad idea, especially at such a relatively high dose. I'm hoping that dropping from 2 to 1mg will help with the annoying effects, give me some sense of control and renew my desire to get off of the stuff, even if I go back to slowly reducing but from 1mg rather than 2.

How long do you think it will take my body to adjust to a new lower dose? I'm guessing weeks rather than days... Could anyone who has done this in my situation tell me how bad it might be? Or am I worrying too much about something that'll be mostly painless?

I'm not too worried about any relapse, I'm confident that I'm over it, for now at least. Maybe I'm being overconfident but I feel sick of opiates in general given my recent feelings about my buprenorphine habit.

So me and my SO do blues occasionally. Actually, we occasionally take breaks from blues. I make good money, so she doesn't have to work. She worked when we first met, and my life was worse than it is now, and it allowed me to get a somewhat grip on things. I buy my blues from IRL sources. My SO and her brother really like weed, i stopped smoking years ago. Since the darknet offers a better selection and price to the weed thats around, i tend to get it from there for her and her brother, along with other drugs that people request from time to time. I will sometimes get samples of opiates that i havent had or havent had in a long time. A few weeks ago i got some BTH and smoked it. It was okay. Then i got .2 of some ECP the other day. Normally i can bang two blues at once and it gets me level (add another two and im probably nodding), but this .2 had me level all day. I couldn't get too high, as we were supposed to be on a break from using blues. A day or two later i order a gram. It comes from only a state away. Im sitting here waiting for the postman to come to deliver my package. I last used suboxone last night, so im going on over 12 hours from last dosage, as of right now. I tell people i know about this stuff, and they are amazed. I should be making a killing with this stuff. If you are lucky, you can get good $90/g stuff here, but you can almost guarantee without a doubt, that it wont be $90 next time, or it will cut to shit next time, if not both. The current rate is about $160/g - if you can get it. And half the time its mixed with fent. I can get this insanely good stuff for $160/g or less (if i buy more).

Not sure where i was going with this. I guess im just killing time before the postman comes. Im hoping he comes while my SO is out (like now), because last time he put it in a stuffed duck, and my SO was wondering why i got shipped a stuffed duck (that had a obv cut down its back), luckily it got the product out before my SO investigated.",1516641583.0

I can't be the only one","To make a long story short, I started suffering chronic migraines around the spring of 2016. I saw a neurologist who threw a bunch of pills at me over the summer. I didn't get much relief, so out of frustration I turned to pills. In the winter of 2016, I discovered kratom. By the summer of '17, I was taking at least 60 grams of it per day.

Due to various circumstances I could no longer afford it, so I stopped cold turkey. That's when I was hit with the worst headache of my life, far worse than any migraine I ever had. The worst part was, it never went away. I could go on and on about the soul-crushing, all-consuming pain, about how I didn't eat or sleep or days, but the short version is, I was hospitalized for trying to end my life.

Fast forward a bit and I managed to survive long enough to be placed on 12 mg/day of suboxone. It was great for about two weeks, then wouldn't you know, another transcendently painful, multi-day headache. I survived by taking multiple strips and being placed on a seizure medication that took the edge off.

This process repeated about once every two weeks or so, till I finally decided to hell with all opiates, and quit suboxone cold turkey.

I've been off subs for almost three months. I've had a chronic headache this whole time. My neuro knows about it and has thrown a few pills at me but nothing has worked out. I think he's desensitized to me honestly. It's different from a migraine, it's a very blunt pain that often encompasses my whole head with no nausea.

Am I the only one in the universe with a chronic headache like this? Is there anything else I can do. I can't imagine living the rest of my life in this much pain. I was hoping that as my tolerance went down and my brain healed the pain would get better, but there doesn't seem to be any end in sight. Would agmatine help at all? I still do have some tolerance, as I sampled some kratom last week and it took 9 grams to feel anything.",1516639829.0

It's been only 18hrs and while I'm physically fine for the most part (alprazolam, diazepam, gabapentin, ibuprofen, cyclizine and weed), I can't stop crying. I'm thinking of things that I never found sad before due to my opiated stupor. 

Like I remember a couple weeks back I was visiting my folks and my mom, an elderly lady, was very enthusiastic about a new job interview which involved her making a video interview of herself. She really tried and put a lot of effort but was turned down quite rudely because of her age, she wasn't all that upset but this concept of my moms enthusiasm just dying is making me weep. Also today my dad sends me a photo of a lot of old baggies and wraps I left there when I was 18 (10 years ago), and asked me nicely how my sobriety was doing. Of course I lied and said yeah I'm still 10 months completely clean. Also my baby sister left to another province for uni, and I didn't even say goodbye. In fact I ignored her phone calls the past few weeks.. I have a child on the way and this transformation isn't only about me anymore, so it has to be done. I need to go back to being the good person that I was. This habit has made me too numb towards those I love. 

My dboy missed call me 2hrs ago and every fucking fiber of my being is saying go pick up and give up. Less than 24 hours. The only thing stopping me is that I am sobbing pretty consistently, and it's raining. I want to order a pizza with all my money even if I don't eat it. This hand full of comfort meds ain't doing shit and when I inhale while crying I want to yak.

Sorry for any typos or grammar errors in advanced since im texting from my cell because i just sold my laptop so i could cop some dope. I live near a major city with an open air drug trade. Since most if not all of the ""dope"" sold there is fent right now ive developed a fentanyl addiction. 

I know it is because my brother and I use together and he recently had a drug test at a rehab facility before he left and his test only showed positive for fent and carfent.

Ive tried both subs and methadone in my life. I went on subs 5 or 6 years ago when my addiction was only pills. It helped but i relapsed. I was going to a methadone clinic about a year ago but stopped because i was still using on top of my 90mg a day dose and i got a serious side effect of hot flashes and sweating which was killing me. Id dose in the am. Go to work and break out in horrid sweats. It made me so embarrassed. Id get home and just use fent and feel better.

The reason i see no way out currently is because as of today i have no money. My next paycheck is the friday before the super bowl. I have no insurance and make too much money to get medicaid or whatever. My paychecks come and I have work that day so instead of using it to buy insurance or whatever i have to buy drugs.

I dont think suboxone would help a fent addiction. Ive heard and read that suboxone just doesnt make a fent addict feel well. I could try a methadone taper idk.

I guess even more importantly is honestly i enjoy using. Ive used opiates for over 10 years. The longest i went without was about 20 days before my ex gf left me because of it. Everything in my life is ruined so I just live with my parents watch tv and browse the internet while high. 

I guess the only positive is somehow over the course of my addiction ive stayed away from the needle. I only snort. Well anyway. Not sure why Im even posting this. If anyone has any advice on how to take fmla in my situation or if theyve overcome a fent addiction lmk Ty.

My boyfriend of 3 years found heroin in my bag and he’s a drug user himself and has tried heroin once but made me promise to never do it again

That didn’t work out and I started using everyday, sometimes at his house I’d sneak in the bathroom and do some. I was so ashamed of my addiction and how I was lying to him and I also didnt want him trying more and going down this road. Mostly I was just ashamed that I couldnt stop using. I felt like a failure and a disgrace and now I even feel more so. Multiple times he asked me if I was on something because I was itchy and I said “It’s just Kratom”. Once he even told me “If youre using heroin you can tell me I wont be mad, I just care” and I said no. Because Im a fucking moron. And didnt want him finding out and getting pissed and making me throw everything out

Well he looked in my bag today and found heroin. He claims it “fell out of my bag” but I fucking dubt that because it was hidden well in a penic sharpener. I tried telling him it was for my friend and he was yelling calling me a liar and an untrustworthy junkie. He was so angry and said he cant even look at me and just left

Should I just continue with my lie or confess? I feel like if I confess he’ll leave me because I’ve lied so many times over this.

Fuck heroin I’m such a fucking mess. I had to take a day off work and how Im going to get some needles and stuff, I dont IV but I sure as fuck will if he breaks up with me, heroin will already destroy a 3 year relationship with the only man I loved, cant get any worse than this. :( What can i say to make him stay?

And yes I know Im a complete lying idiot, this is the only thing Ive lied to him about but its a big thing. Fuck me.

Update: gonna tell him and hope for the best

Update: inb4 more responses with “naive” and “weak”, I was really not in a good mindset when I wrote that. I would love to write that entire post over again, I won’t be posting on reddit when I am extremely emotionally distressed anymore lol. No, a breakup is not the worst I’ve ever been through, no need to judge people off one reddit post. I have been though a lot of shit due to benzo and alcohol addiction, which I am now sober from, including mental illnesses I have recovered from. It’s not me being naive and overreacting like a teenager, even though I can totally see how cringey that whole post was, I am in treatment for a mental disorder with symptoms of an extreme fear of abandonment and very extreme fluctuating emotions. My initial reaction was to write this sob story paragraph on reddit. I’m pretty embarassed at the entire post I’m probably gonna delete it soon as I got all the answers I wanted, lol. I’m feeling better now, and will share everything with my boyfriend soon.

No, no, no,  ***note to junky; dboy has more than one customer***  They don't wait around all day just for your call. This also applies to the junky trying to score behind someone's back.

My habit is out of control. It's not as bad as some of you all, but the amount of money I've spent, the unholy things I've done to obtain my drugs... It's sickening.

I was full-on junkie behavior today. Laid around all morning til I got the call then jumped up looking like a ratchet unshowered wreck and ran out the door lying my ass off, pulling money from several places including sketch store returns, couldn't even make it home to use and found myself staring at myself in the disgusting bathroom mirror hating every second of it all. Actually I went to 2 different gas station bathrooms because I couldn't get all the pills to dissolve in the syringe at the first one (boofing) so I had a shit-covered syringe ""that I needed for my kids medicine"" in my pocket for a bit. 

The pinnacle was sitting in the parking lot with my $70 in hand, wearing a shirt for a company I used to work for waiting for my drugs and thinking how shitty that would make my mugshot (think prestigious job.... In the medical field.... working with addicts smh). They shorted me and they've ripped me off before and I went back because I'm fucking stupid and I was in withdrawal.

To wait all day to do my shitty drugs that was half of what I paid for, and I'm already almost out 4 hours later... Man its just depressing. I hate carrying this weight around. It's like I put on a backpack full of bricks every day and it makes every part of my life more difficult than it has to be. It hurts, and I somehow convince myself that I HAVE to do it. I NEED these little pills to keep going. 

Anyway this one time really pissed me off because I've got something really REALLY good about to happen in my life in less than a fucking week--I've been waiting for this for over 3 years.., and if anything had gone wrong all of that would have been ruined. My life would have done a 180 right down the shitter. A nose dive.

Thankfully nothing bad happened (minus the usual getting ripped off and prolly laughed at for their double come up). I know this is a shit post I'm just really scared of fucking my life up, scared of being sober. 

Any kind words would really help. Thank you fam. ",1516776623.0
7sl9fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7sl9fg/hey_guys_i_need_some_advice/,14,https://redd.it/7sl9fg,superstoreglenn,Hey guys I need some advice.,"I’ll do my best to format this well and explain myself clearly. I have used opiates in pill form most of my life but only for health issues. I will be honest with y’all and say yes there were a few times I took an extra one just to get a little buzz if I was out with friends or something. 

I’ve been getting kidney stones since I was 10 anyone who’s had them will say that’s awful fucking pain so I’ll get prescribed something for a short amount of time and that’s it. I’m also prone to ovarian cysts and same story with that one. 

Recently (started over a year ago but not much over) I’ve been having this headache that I can not describe to you, when i first got it I woke up thinking someone had broken into my home and beat me with a bat. My pcp prescribed me norco for the pain and it helped ALOT. I would run out early cause sometimes I needed more than one. 

I moved States and unfortunately this state has a big narcotics issue and I’m young so they think I’m a drug seeker all the time. I suppose I am in a way but it’s really not for fun. In May I went to the ER with my head pain causing vision problems and leaving me screaming in agony. They did a spinal tap and sent me home saying I was a drug seeker and they don’t want to help me. 

That same night I woke up after knocking out with the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life, kidney stones, broken bones, cysts, labor etc NOTHING could touch this pain holy shit I could cry just thinking about it. Turns out they let out too much spinal fluid. I spent the next 10 Days in the hospital getting dilaudid and norco every couple of hours. Once I could finally go to the bathroom on my own without crying I got sent home with NO medication. Total bullshit. 

So anyways. That head pain came and went every other week or so I’d have an attack. October I got kidney stones. I went to the ER every couple of days to get pain relief and they’d only send me home with a couple days worth so that’s why I kept going back until I finally saw a specialist who said I shouldn’t be in as much pain as I’m claiming like wtf?? Are YOU the one feeling it?! 

This led me to asking my mom for some of her pain meds or buying some of my friends script. Since end of November though the head pain has started to worsen. It was now weekly almost every other day. I finally got a new pcp last month. 

She gave me Tylenol 4 not exactly what I wanted but honestly I was grateful for it anyways. I called her and let her know I ran out about 4 Days early. I told her up front I’d be honest with her but since the head pain was now daily as of 3 weeks ago I had no choice. She said she would not refill until after I get some testing done. Here’s the thing. Making appointments out here for literally anything takes fucking weeks. It took 5 weeks just to see a urologist. 

I want to add as well that I have told her I try EVERYTHING before I reach for a pain pill. I always go for excedrin/ibuprofen first, a hot shower beating onto my head, massage, I’ve even put icy hot onto my scalp looking for relief. This head pain is ruining my life. 

I don’t know how to make her see that I’m desperate but not really an active drug seeker I just need relief so I can live my life. I love my life it’s excellent and seems to only be getting better but this pain (and occasional kidney/flank pain) are debilitating. They’re ruining my life. I’ve been passed over for pain management but they’re still trying to get me an appointment which I appreciate. 

Someone please tell me what to say to make her understand that if I don’t get help in reliving this pain I might just end it. It sounds super fucking dramatic but it’s the damn truth it hurts so bad. I even tried calling my dr in my old state to see if she could help me but I got nothing. I’m at a complete loss. The appointment is tomorrow I don’t want to go in crying and begging for help but I NEED her to understand that until the mri/blood work and all that stuff comes back with what’s causing this and then they can figure out a treatment plan then I’m all for that! But right this very second I’m sorry I need pain pills. 

I’m very close to losing an AMAZING job I have because I’ve missed so much work for illness. I don’t smoke or drink or take anything illegal (other than buying scripts from friends which is technically illegal I know) 

Any advice please just give me a good way to word it to her that I am desperate but without coming off like “I’m addicted and I wanna take all of these pills at once” I’m at my wits end. ",1516776101.0

I ruined my ex-girlfriend's life. I am a 18 year old girl just finishing up high school. Lately I've been feeling very responsible for the downward-spiral I've thrown my ex into. Her and I started hanging out a year and a half ago. I'd basically live at her house on the weekends and we'd have parties. We both had never touched a drug before in our lives and I wanted to try something. She hesitantly agree to do something with me. I ended up stealing a whole bottle of oxy from my parents and we tried it that weekend. We both fell in love with it and soon after we fell in love with eachother too. We developed a habit and soon enough the bottle was empty, so we moved on to something else. When that would go dry, we'd keep moving until there was nothing else to do. School became a blur, withdrawals were worse for her because of the depression. She ended up in an impatient facility where she met someone new. Someone with better drugs, she was never in love with me. She left the impatient a week later and left me in the dark. I submerged myself in anything that would give me a chance to forget. A month went by without me noticing, she called me from the hospital. She was crying, telling me she missed me, saying she had overdosed the night before. I went crawling back to her but she continued to see the girl she was dating at the time. When I saw her again, she had completely changed. Her eyes were cold, her voice was harsh. She was pale and held a constant dark presence. I had lost her completely. Now a year and a half later, I haven't heard from or seen her since. She hasn't asked about me. She had so many dreams and I feel like I ruined her. I did ruin her. 

I miss her warmth. ",1516771532.0

I've never used a needle in my life, but I have a long history with opiates - coming up on eight years since my car accident (therefore pain meds). Tramadol, Nucynta, oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin, tea, fent. 

I was clean from heroin for a while recently, using suboxone. I relapsed right around new years and have used pretty much daily since. My new location has beans instead of glassine baggies like I was used to in NY. 

Anyway, today my boyfriend and our friend went down to the city to get our shit. All was well but he got a little too high. Id been taking care of him, but then decided Id do a bean and a half. 

So i go downstairs to take care of him, remember nothing after. I collapsed onto the floor and wasnt breathing. My bf gace me mouth to mourh while waiting for the paramedics (no cops came). They hit me with 2 shots of narcan. I came to and saw the paramedics and his dad over me and i began screamung for my bf - who they said was impaired and woukdnt let him near me in the house. 

He made up a story that i still take tramadol and told them it was a mini seizure and the reason the narcan brought me back is tramadol being and opiate.

I left AMA. I never thought i would fucking OD. I snort my shit. I do a tiny amlunt wjth each new pickup to test it. I fucked up by being pissy at his level so i decided to do more tk get there myself. Im also presxribed gabapentin and xanax. so was on that too.

Following 4 weeks of medically supervised detox stabilization, there was no advantage in prolonging suboxone use (7 days vs 28 days taper). The 7 day taper participants had a greater rate of opioid free urine specimens than those who had a 28 day taper. This was a sample of over 500 randomly assigned participants so quite representative.^1,2

Initial suboxone doses ranged from 2-8 mg on the first day in another study. Doses were mainly stable for up to 24 months averaging 10-24 mg per day (notice higher than induction). 75% of patients continued medication assisted therapy, tapered off it, or started methadone maintenance or inpatient therapy. 21% tapered from suboxone though no follow-up on their success with abstinence was conducted.^3


Abstinence may be maintained with a brief and intensive suboxone taper, followed by use of naltrexone. While the study had small samples, abstinence was greater in a 4 week versus 2 or 1 week taper condition (after stabilization). While 63% of individuals were abstinent after 4 weeks of tapering, 29% of individuals were also abstinent after 2 and 1 week tapers (non-trivial). While these results contradict the previous study, results were no different at 1 and 3 month follow ups (aka the same number of people were clean or not clean). There were other differences in treatment conditions as well.^4

In youths age 16-24 a 56 day taper was superior to a 28 taper in producing opioid negative urinalysis. ^5

Patients had a better likelihood of transitioning off opiates when in a 30 day rather than 5 day suboxone treatment program.^6


In summary, we don't really know much about ""long term"" (beyond 30 days) suboxone treatment but we do know that anywhere between 7-30 days can be effective in reducing opioid use. Several studies use counseling in conjunction with suboxone. 

To me it seems with the right support, there is no reason to be on suboxone for months or years at a time - though 'with the right support' is saying a lot. I'd love to hear people's thoughts about long and short term suboxone treatment.

And how bad of an idea is it to visit him or send him money?","*This is a throw away account for obvious reasons*

Ugh, I gotta pour one out for the homie big time... My dealer is in jail. Long story short he was headed over to my house to do a trade, some norco 10s and some xanax for some fire black, not that it really matters, but he never showed up and never got back to me... for days. He never took days to get back to me. 

Well, I mentioned it to another client of his that I had just met and become friends with. Ironically, he's in jail too right now, for the dumbest reason possible; failing a SCHEDULED piss test. He'll be in for another month but that's doable. Anyways, she looked up his first and last online and, well, he got caught.

Now, I know what he had on him for the most part. A scale of course, a ton of needles, baggies (most likely at least 50), at least one prebagged measurements of black but most likely more, and anywhere from 3 to 14 grams of black on him. I bet he had some suboxone and either some Xanax, kpins, or both. I think this is his first major offense. I know he's been to jail for minor things before but I don't remember if he had gotten caught up for heroin before.

Anyways, my dealer was a great, great guy. He delivered usually with no charge, he was almost always on time (dealer time, but still, if he said 15 minutes it always meant no less than 45) and over time we started to hang out. Hell, I would loan him money sometimes and he always got me back with interest. He helped me find junkie chicks and all around was a great guy. 

I miss him already and I know hes sicker than a dog right now in that cold, lonely jail cell :'(

TL;DR how much time do you think getting pulled over in a car with a scale, baggies, possibly several prebagged doses of dope, some kpins and 3-12 grams of dope will being if its his first offense? ",1516755815.0

A little background info, I'm pretty opiate tolerant mostly use Opana just recently had a 4 month break from all opiates due to a stint in jail. When I got out in November I only used Kratom and lope for my cravings until I gave in and relapsed two or three times using opana for only 2 or 3 days each time a couple months ago I'm currently on community control (probation)  other than that I've only been using Kratom to satisfy my cravings and keep myself from tearing my hair out due to cravings and not being able to get anything done due to anxiety and general dysphoria. While I was in jail suboxone was pretty prevalent there and I remember taking an 1/8th or less of an 8mg strip and snorting it, and getting incredible euphoria. My cravings were non existent during those times. I only used suboxone 3 times while in jail. 

I just got on suboxone last week and decided to keep snorting it and i'm taking under my prescribed dosage which is 4mg twice daily instead I'm taking 2mg a day because I've read less is more. I'm just not getting that magic I got when taking it in jail. Could the kratom have affected my tolerance? I'm curious how to make it better for me so I can get some euphoria or a small buzz when I dose. As I reread this I feel like a lot of people might judge me for trying to get high while on maintenance but I'm prepared for it. But I do know there are other people who have been here before.

I had been on day 2 of opiate WD and was feeling like complete rats titties and I hit up the very few people I've met in this city since I have moved here.

Unfortunately, the strongest opiate I could find was fucking hydro 10s and they wanted $6 a piece for them... No thanks. Especially because they wouldn't even alleviate any of my WD symptoms.

About 9-10 o'clock that evening, I get a text from a friend that says he thinks he can score some H. Well I head over and get to his place. He tells me that the dude he thinks he can score from doesn't have an active phone, but does just show up randomly at times.

30 minutes pass and low and behold, he shows up! Fuck yeah! I throw dude 40 to get me a half of some tar and promise to break him off some... I'm generous and an all around nice guy. Well he has to drive 1 hour away to get it... FUCK. 

Me and my friend end up just chillin and watching TV, while I'm holding in my bowels and trying not to explode like a volcano. Time seems to be standing still as I can hear my wrist watch tick....tick.....tick. Well he finally knocks on the door after a lengthy 2 1/2 hour trip.

""I have some bad news, guys"" he says. My stomach drops even lower and gets even tighter than it has been for the past two days. ""I got ripped off. The guy sold me molasses"". At this point I am FUMING and KNEW I should have gone with this guy to pick up the fucking dope. I am trying not to explode physically and emotionally at this point as I say ""it's all good dude. It happens to the best of us"" with as much sarcasm as I can inflict upon that sentence.

He splits after my friend gives him a quick chat. Now I am just sitting on the couch, incredibly pissed off beyond belief that I let my fucking money walk. I had so much faith in the situation that I made a rookie mistake.

My friend and I then decide to chill in his bedroom. I go to the bathroom to release my bowels for what seems like the 30th time that day. When I get finished and walk back into the room, I see my friend with two syringes, filled with clear liquid, and he has the biggest shit eating grin on his face.

""Yo dude, you wanna do a shot?"" I look at him like he just grew a head out of the side of his neck. ""what the fuck is in there dude?"" I say in an intereste manner as the only thing I've ever seen mix up clear is coke (which I knew he didn't do), Fentanyl, and ice.

""It's Ice dude. You wanna try some?"" he says, still with that huge fucking smile. Now I LOVE opiates and would choose them over ANY drug if it were available, but they weren't and I wasn't about to say no and not do some and look like a bitch! (great reasoning, right?)

He tosses over the needle and I tie off. He tells me to he careful as it's a quarter gram shot. He also tells me to push the plunger down slow because it can burn and to make sure it's registered because missing with meth can cause some nasty infections.

I hit first try, push down the plunger, take off the tourniquet, and before I can even pull the empty rig out of my arm, this fucking WAVE of heat comes over my body. I first feel it in my ears, then my taint, and then in my chest. Oh God the fucking feeling I got in my chest. It was like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson round housed me right in the sternum and knocked the wind out of me. Then came the dilated pupils. I swear everything got brighter and more vivid and could feel my pupils dilate.

""So, how do you feel Dickstomp?!"" he says excitedly. ""Dude, I never expected it to be like this. I think I may have found a new favorite"" I say, still not believing that I would have EVER switched from a downer to a stimulant. Not to mention, this was my first time ever doing meth and I IVed what most people smoke throughout the day.

The night carries on with me talking my jaw off, constantly pissing, going back to talking and conspiring, and before I know it, it's morning time. I didn't even feel sick anymore and since I had done that shot, I didn't even THINK of being dope sick. Here I am, 3 days into opiate wd and I feel fantastic.

The following weeks are filled with binging, jacking off for hours on end, binging more, bouts of drug induced psychosis, and a whole new addiction in hand....but hey! I quit opiates which is good, right?..... RIGHT?!


Honestly, I feel like meth is an easier drug addiction to handle. I currently use ice practically every day now, but only shoot about a point or maybe two if its a normal day and when I binge, I do tend to shoot about .4-.5 if I'm feeling froggy. Also since using meth, I have not touched an opiate the whole time. I also have had multiple stints of sobriety, with my longest being 7 days.

The only negative side effects from the meth for me are of course loss of appetite, dehydration (I try to drink as much water as possible), seeing and hearing things that sometimes aren't there (shadow people and some noises that startle me), and the worst one is probably just the ""on edge"" feeling I have but I have generalized anxiety so that feeling of impending doom is always there.

Fortunately with the aid of my psych meds, if things get a little TOO smacked, twacked, and gacked, I can pop my meds and be knocked out within 30 minutes so sleep deprivation is never a problem unless I forcefully keep myself awake.

If you read this, bless you because I tend to ramble and my story telling abilities are sub-par, even when I'm sober like I currently am.

I still frequent this sub as the stim and meth subreddit tend to get a little...colorful at times. Hope my opiate family is doing well and everyone has been safe!

Remember to practice harm reduction, do test shots of new shit, and say your prayers to JJ if you are sick!

Much love, family.

The drug scene is ever so prevalent as has been as long as I can remember. I remember hearing my teachers in elementary discuss with coworkers about our town being a meth town and a heroin town. Show up to school and there's orange cones in the building taking up most of the hallway that has it's walls covered in sea animal paintings to put copper wire back in, because of those ""fuckin tweakers"". 

Alright, so then I knew. Drug addicts do things that have a very clear impact on the world outside of the drug scene and they blatantly don't give a singular fuck. Okay cool deal I can handle that, at least they're not hurting other people right? At least not as often as they're stripping copper? 

And even if they were going to hurt someone else, say someone else even in the drug scene, they'd do it nice and quick so they can go back out to the garden at 4 in the morning and cut slugs in half with scissors, right?

I'm beginning to see I'm very wrong. Very recently my homegirl was kidnapped. She was MIA for almost 4 days before I got to her. I had the location of the biggest city in the county over (big ass city, to my standard anyway) and 3 unrecognizable names to work with. She was on foot, phone broken, and in captivity. I played investigator for 2 straight days and got like 90% of the order of events down to the very hour, shortly after I went to the city and found her myself. I called the county police twice and they basically told me knock knock jokes over phone. This is the second time I've rescued her from a serious, legitimate, low odds of survival kidnapping in the last year. Both times she was beaten and bloodied. I got her home safe the night before last, yesterday she was arrested and sent to jail. So naturally I've been runnin around at night pulling moves with her older brother lately, who as I learned last night has also been kidnapped in the last 12 months, also near death experience. 

The people who kidnapped him live in a trap about 3 miles from where I stay, been in the house a handful of times. I semi-often pull moves with a kid who lives there, who also, as it turns out, has been beaten and kidnapped and gotten away as well. Last night I put all of this in front of me and just started hitting people up to see what kinda answers I would get. 

It's 10. You guys 10 different people that I actively see in my life have been kidnapped, almost killed and gotten away. The farthest back was 7 years ago. There are more people I'm going to try. I also know of some cases where the victim did not make it out alive, though these are few and far between. So my question is...

What in the rimjob loving fuck is going on here? Did I miss a town meeting or something? Did I not get that memo? Is that email in my spam folder? Because what the fuck. So now I'm asking you guys too. Is kidnapping a common thing in the drug scene you belong to?",1516731913.0

**H a different beast**

---

I tried heroin out of curiosity, just smoking it on foil, never tried a needle, 2.5g bag of brown H.

It feels amazing, it is cheap at first, you think you can control it. But the truth is, you will pay back for the pleasure it gives you, and pay back much more than you received.  

Once or twice a week became weekend speedball binges, which became daily binges or at least H when I ran out of the white stuff. One day, I binged too hard and slept for ~ 16 hours and woke up withdrawing.  

WD is hell. I'm a grown ass man and I was crying, no sobbing, in my smelly, sweat covered bed for 3 days (thank god I used for a short time, no longer than a month at a time), trying to find anything to get rid of this feeling.  

Thankfully, I realized I was going through WDs, and chose to stop taking H, even though I had a bit left, to detox myself to avoid leading to full-blown addiction.

---

Even after suffering through the ordeal, I thought I can handle this like I could handle all the other drugs I tried. I bought another 2.5g and tried to chip responsibly.  

**Boy was I wrong...**  

Little did I know, I was addicted to it already. I suffered through withdrawals after using another month, a couple days a week at first to daily use, to the point where I would smoke a bit of H, smoke a cigarette and immediately puke my guts out.  

 Thankfully, my second detox was just before Christmas when I had to go back home to an area where you really cant find drugs.  

After the second WD, that's when I realized that every time I try it, even just once, I would go into daily use within a week.

**You may destroy your life like countless others.  
You may learn what it is like to WD, have depression and the point of view of a drug addict.  
All of this because of 5 grams of brown powder.**

Am I glad I tried it and got out in time with a rough spanking?  

To be honest, yes, I learned that 'junkies' are just people trapped by chemical dependency, not bad people.  

I learned that chemical pleasure is why we live this life, but also that naturally produced chemicals by means of exercise or living life to its fullest are so much more sustainable for long, happy, healthy life than the temporary pleasures that drugs provide.

Anyone thinking of trying Heroin, know this.

It is only lucky circumstance that saved me from its clutches.

This combination made me blackout for 12 hours and my dad had to rush me to the hospital. 
My family was scared shitless. All i remember is finishing the kratom tea after eating all those other drugs and the next 12 hours is blank. From what my dad told me, i came home and did 4 more blues in the bathroom. I was sleeping while standing up pretty much but my stepmom said I was the most talkative I've ever been with her. (i do not remember driving around all night in a blackout state) 
I am currently withdrawing from roxys, (been using daily since august) and i am determined to turn my life around. I went to a narcotics anonymous meeting the other night and it was good. I just want to be happy again without using drugs. I want to be a better big brother for my younger siblings. I want them to look up to me rather than see me as the ""drug addicted loser older brother""
I lost some weight, haven't been able to sleep well in days, and haven't really had an appetite in days.
I want to stay clean off opiates for the rest of my life. My body is so used to having Roxy in my system in the morning, afternoon, and nighttime. I just want this vicious cycle to be over already!!
I spent half of my savings account on drugs from august to 4 days ago. ($100-120 a day habit). Not good at all.
Anyone got any advice for handling the withdrawals ? thanks guys.

Knowing that I had this stuff set aside provided me with an ever-present safety net of reassurance and security. No matter what the situation, unable to find more, afford more, main stash gets found and/or I get busted, etc, I would not have to worry about being empty handed for a long time. And that reassurance alone was like being wrapped in a secure, fuzzy blanket. 

But the more I looked at that baggie of dope the more I saw it as a leash. In fact, I think I had the whole safety net concept backwards: the net wasn't for me, it was for the drug. If I ever ran out and couldn't get more, that back up baggie was the net, the leash, that kept me close. 

If I didn't have it, I may be forced to withdraw and be clean. I would have to exist in the reality that living without dope is not only possible, but perhaps I may even like it enough to continue not using.

But having a back up stash means that I could/would keep using. As long as the dope kept me on its rope, the idea of being without it would only exist as a nightmare. Being CLEAN or SOBER, would seem terrifying. But as long as I had more junk, I would never have to worry about those words.

TL:DR: Read it though.

So now here I am... I ended up trading my stash back to my dealer so now all I have left is a little bit of monkey water. Knowing that I dont have anything to fall back on is frightening. I feel more and more nervous as I imagine the very real and now unavoidable moment that approaches. The moment when I squeeze the monkey water bottle and nothing comes out. What happens then?

I think I have a very emotionally vivid reaction to sticking a needle in a vein, and I'm trying to figure out why.  

As near as I can tell, I think it's the associations.  Our society avenges acts of violence by strapping the perpetrator down, sticking a needle in their vein and pumping in chemicals to smother the electrical activities of life out of them, a pharmaceutical pillow over the face of a hardened criminal who really deserves it.  

We could use more violence, like a beheading or a shooting, but of course, we do things the civilized way.  We're not animals after all.

And speaking of, we also do the same thing to our pets ""out of love"", right?  It's got to be for their own good, just like taking away their reproductive abilities in their earlier years.  Or a terminally ill person to ""end their suffering""?  We couldn't possibly relieve their end-of-life pain in any other way. 

'Cause if it looks like a medical procedure, with a guy in scrubs involved, we must be helping them, right?  Because doctors have never been known to act unethically.  After all, they give you shots and you've known that shots are good for you, ever since you were a baby.  They hurt, but that's how you know they're good for you.

And that must be why I can't stop shooting this orange crap into my veins.  The initial pain is almost an essential part of the experience.  Subconsciously, on a visceral level, it feels so therapeutic!  Yet I can't help but think about these other things also.

Stick the tar under your shoe like gum.

It should stick long enough for the search to be over and even at that you can drag your shoe so the heroin is on the ground in case they want to check your shoes for whatever reason.

Need advice.,"Title is self explainatory. I have the OK to move to maryland and continue my drug court over there and i just have to come back once a month for court and do my status hearings. I am going to a nice recovery house in maryland because really having a plan to go to a recovery house is the only reason im still at my parents. 

So, I plan on going to see the doc at the clinic next thursday and starting detox the following monday. I will be going from 75 to 0 in 15 days, so 5mgs a day. I have been on MAT since july 31st of this year, i have also been narcanned while on 60 and it hurt like a mother fucker so i have a small preview of the pain i guess.

The things i have in my arsenal for me are, (unfortunately no weed cuz of drug court) 36 mgs of etizolam and im sure my mom will be nice enough to order more if im in enough pain, #51 600mg gabapentin pills, plus ibuprofen and all that OTC bullshit. I got some immodium sitting here and can grab another bottle if needed. 

I got plenty of time to kill to cuz im unemployed. The only thing that sucks is i still gotta go to a group once a week, individual once a week, and meetings 5 times a week for drug court, and i gotta go to the clinic and piss once a week all while drawing and watching everyone else dose still. ugh. But i got netflix, HBO go, reddit, and music.

Ill be honest with you guys, im definetly relying alot on etizolam to help me with this. Hope it works. So i plan on doing the 2 week taper to 0, then 2 weeks of hell at my parents house, and then to get into this recovery house i have to do 21-28 days in a inpatient place so after the initial 2 week taper, 2 weeks at the house drawing, ill have another month till i have to go to this house and start looking for a job and going to meetings everyday and all that shit so at least i got 2 months till i really have to be a part of the real world. 

TLDR; So, I plan on going to see the doc at the clinic next thursday and starting detox the following monday. I will be going from 75 to 0 in 15 days, so 5mgs a day. I have been on MAT since july 31st of this year

So after almost 2 years of binging H (iv) and every opiate I could put my hands on, I got clean. I am on naltrexone oral tablets (50mg) daily for about 3 months now. I refused the vivitrol shot so I have to deal with crushed pills that I must drink in a solution every morning. 
Beeing a good junkhead, after 1 month being clean I started preparing to get high one more time. So I waited. After 2 months I managed to avoid the naltrexone for two days (actually 60h) and went for it. And NOTHING. Maybe a slight buzz from the H but zero euphoria. I know the risks and I don't want to do abnormal amounts to get through the nalt, because the chances of getting it right are almost nonexistent. The next morning (~72h+) I wanted to try again. Just as I was leaving to get the dope, I got surprised and had to drink the solution earlier. Got really pissed. In the desperate attempt not to throw away the pervious 2 days, I runned in the toilet and threw up till I saw blood an felt there is nothing more left. It took me about 5 minutes after drinking the solution. So, because I really want to feel the warmth, I figured if anything was left from the pill it would take maybe 20 minutes till the naltrexone kicks in. Random bs. Maybe it would've been better to wait if the dose left was tiny. Fuck it.. Got in the car and took the dope. Took me 15 min. And...NOTHING. And those were some fat bags. 
Now, I heard bupe (subutex) has a higher affinity to bind then the naltrexone. Took 2 mg of bupe sublingualy at first. Nothing. The next day I took 8mg and felt a calming effect and uplift in mood. Next day took 8 mg again subli. Felt some warmth and relaxation finally (not like the one you get from H but...). It's ok at best if you compare it with the real shit but hey at least something works against this fucking blocker. I don't want to go 16mg at once. And I don't iv subs and bupe. I am sure you can OD even on bupe so be careful.
And the big question for you guys: Today I run across some fentanyl patches 25mcg/hr. I wonder if they can do a better job then the bupe? Anyone has some experience please share. I will probably get them and try but would hope for some input before I do.

Longest clean time was less than 30 days, no matter what I told others or maybe even posted on here.

Idk. I can't even keeptrack of the web of lies I've spun. I don't want recovery. If money wasn't an issue id be using every day. Every time I type the letter L, a tracking number from a Chinese opioid shipment from November pops up. Maybe should reset phone or keyboard at least.  I'm actually typing this while balancing about 20 mg of unknown powder sold as dope on my phone screen.  It's all white I doubt there's much heroin in there. 

Playing it safer but not safe at all by doing tiny amounts at a time. Who knows how long I'll keep THAT up b4 I say fuck it and do a big bump. Thank God I can't hit myself or id surely be dead.  I don't even know why I'm sharing this. If anybody has ever felt hopeless while trying to engage in recovery,  please pm me. Actually anybody at all who wishes to talk can pm me.  

Thanks for reading my eye cancer posting.",1516830242.0

And I seem to mistake reddit for my diary bc I'm pathetically alone with this shit, which I apologize sincerely for. 



As indicated, I used to do escort to support my habit. Now I only meet with two guys from that time whom I learned to like a lot. Just had a date with one of them and he's just he sweetest. He likes feet, he likes to cuddle, he okay with only handjobs, eats pussy like he has one himself and is a wonderful, insightful and intelligent person to talk to. I can't believe I'm getting paid to spend time with him. Granted, he's old and no Adonis, but that's why he's buying my time.

He doesn't know I use, but I think he might have seen my fresh track marks and I think he didn't really buy the 'I fell and cut my arm on a nail' story (it looks like a huge cut from some distance since I've been sticking the needle in hundreds of times along the vein). But he didn't say anything. And he said he can't wait to see me again. But I got major weird vibes I can't really put my finger on. Like, he didn't look at me when my arm was in the picture. 

Anyways, seeing him today was really a relief. Just having someone give me attention felt so fucking good. Tho it makes the pathetic emptiness of my private life really stand out. I finally ran out of coke and dope without buying new shit and intend to stay on my maintenance from now on. Been maxing out my credit card anyways with the last re up of my stash. 

Yesterday I had an important oral exam in uni. Didn't sleep the night before and was so speedballed out of my mind that I not only was shaking like a leaf in the wind, I made the most stupid mistake of mentioning stuff I couldn't elaborate on. It's still a good grade and won't affect my final grade negatively but I was so pissed off with myself that it really was the wake up call I needed. Hope it sticks. Today I overslept until 11am since I speedballed the last night away. luckily I actually do have migraine, so I could send a quick email without anyone getting suspicious at work.

I pushed the limit really hard, but with the money from tonight I can pay my tuition fee in time and since I'm exhausted from the coke hangover I'll be able to sleep tight and be at work in time tomorrow. I'm so relieved I didn't oversleep the exam or ruined my life by other means through this binge. Had the realization that I don't want to die anymore so there's no reason to wreck my life. Wanted to share this moment with you since there's no one else to share it with. And because I've been crying on this sub about how I can't stop binging on speedballs. 


Hope you're all safe, well and in control of things. <3",1516828795.0

- one guy seemed legit and was all for meeting me and selling me some dope... but he thought I meant weed and disappeared shortly after telling me he doesn’t believe in heroin. (It exists whether you believe in it or not)

- one guy told me he could get me some fire dope but I’d have to go to one of two strip clubs to get it. 

- about 3 guys asked if I just needed to earn some money for my habit. 

- a 43 year old man told me I’d have to earn dope from him and asked if I wanted to “party and get freaky naughty”

- a 27 year old legitimately asked “a/s/l?” Followed by “I’m really just looking for a fwb right now.”

- started talking to someone in recovery who sounds cool but for obvious reasons can’t help me out. 

And honorable mention (I’ll use that term lightly here) goes to the fact that I found out one of my old school friends is in whisper posting vaguely covered selfies of herself talking about how she’s trying to break up her ex boyfriend and his current girlfriend because she wants him back and how she’s already completed step one of her plan: alienating him from his friends.

What I have learned in the last six months is that it absolutely is lonely and dark to have lost her, wrong and sickening and sad. But life is not lonely and dark- life is just life, and I can seek light if I choose.

I choose to seek light in the arms of my dear friend Faith, long estranged but brought back to me in the wake of our all encompassing tragedy. I choose to seek light in loose change showing up in places that it should not, because though I have no explanation I know that it is her.

I choose to seek light in trying to help others from ever seeing the kind of darkness that I have (the kind of darkness that Stella saw)

Firstly hopefully the location is stickied soon by mods to get the warning out. This is probably the first time I've been able to say me and my buddy were lucky to NOT get good money doing our ""games"" to get dope $. Our area a bundle is 13 stamps. We have about the same tolerance, and he often does all 13 in one shot if we made ok cash that day. Luckily, today again, we didn't so he only did 6 and luckily, I was there. 

He shot up in the car and after about 10 seconds I'm driving us out of the neighborhood and ask him if I'm taking him to his moms or uncles. No answer. I figured he just got tired of me asking. I have a brain injury and often repeat myself. I finally look over and see him all but drooling. Hat fell off, eyes closed, not sure if hes breathing but doesn't look like it, and his hand is on his neck almost like he went to check his pulse before going out.

I thought he was fucking with me. This stamps been around a while and this guy is not new to us and the quality is always good but never, like NEVER changes. (Someone obviously fucked up today). It's been so consistent we've been dumb and haven't even been smart and doing test shots. Luckily he only did 6 stamps instead of the whole 13 like he commonly does or I have no doubt he'd be dead atm.

I punched him in the leg HARD like enough to bruise each punch 4-5 times...nothing. Finally I pinched him hard enough to break skin and he woke up with no idea what happened and was angry I pinched him. This process happened another 4 or so times within 1-2 minutes before he finally came out of it. He remembers nothing besides getting pinched.

I was so afraid my friend was going to die right in front of me. Luckily he's good enough to load and shoot and register while im driving him. If he was home alone I don't know if he'd have woken up. Also, if he hadn't done the shot, I would have gone home and probably done 6 to save the other half until morning. Basically, we'd both probably be dead right now if he hadn't done that shot in the car.

I've lost many friends to ODs but never had something that close happen while I was there. He's on the sub but wanted to not be mentioned(username, first name, whatever) but John Doe, glad you made it and probably saved my life in the process too.

Please be safe everyone and don't be like us idiots where we went ""eh who needs a test shot? this shit never changes"". It only takes one fucked heavy fent batch.

If you see the sticky and live in our area, try to avoid it. You know how small our stamps are, .1 test shot of this could kill you. A single bag even with a high tolerance and you'd know because you'd swear you just did 8.

Dope in northern DE, Edgewood/New Castle area. Please read if you're a local.","This is a personal first hand experience so no BS. DE doesn't get mentioned a whole lot but if you're a local and read the title I'm guessing you know exactly probably to the or even the neighborhood I mean.

I've never posted one of these so I hope I'm following the rules but I want people to be safe so hopefully I can be specific as possible without breaking any rules.

Typical blue bags and it is stamped in black ""Ice Cream"". It's pretty commonly known in the area almost never changes so I'm afraid people will skip test shots and OD. Anyone not on reddit...well I wouldn't be surprised if there's a death already. Hopefully some fellow Delawarians read this and help get the word out on the street because it's pretty urgent as yesterday this same stamp was normal. Someone seriously fucked up this batch and my friend almost died over it.

Luckily my friend is ok. He has a high tolerance and if has the money will do a full bundle(13 bags here) shot and is perfectly fine. I'm similar but don't have the money to burn but I even will do 7/8 commonly without a test shot. JJ was with us and luckily he only did 6. I did not notice until I wasn't getting any answers on where I was dropping him. He was slack jaw wide open, eyes shut, hat fallen off, the works. I thought he was playing with me until I punched him about 7 times on the leg hard enough to bruise and it took an extremely hard(enough to break skin) on his face to wake him. This process repeated 4-5 times over 2 minutes and he remembers nothing.

Please be careful. This stuff is probably 10 times more potent than normal and I know these people make several stamps in that area so don't even do a .1 test shot, DE bags are small, so seriously a test of 1 stamp or .03 roughly is smart and try if at all possible not to use alone.

I feel quite ashamed because I took an opiate, but I think this will actually help bring me down a bit, it's A LOT better than hitting up the dboy for a couple wraps right ? 

I'm kinda ashamed of myself, but day 3 is usually the worst IME so if I use a once off codeine dose (extremely weak for me) to help get another day free from horse it is actually a good thing right ? 

I feel guilty Reddit, but also much much better.

... Some ketamine (pink rig) and a filter shot (blue rig). I'm not a huge fan of iv ketamine, but snorted doesn't do it for me and I really need to fall asleep asap and relax (it's 3am where I'm at).  




My mind is racing with cravings and I have almost convinced myself to go and buy some coke and dope after work, before having another date. I mean, the date money has to pay my rent, tuition and insurance. Of course, I'll scrape by if I spend a 50 on some dope tomorrow. But today was just day one after the binge. What tells me that it'll be only once tomorrow. 




Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck... I hate that I need to argue with myself and that it always comes to admitting that my brain is hijacked, but that I don't care bc I want or *need* to get high. Yeah, okay, I used to be very acutely suicidal, but I can use this only so long as an excuse for needing drugs to function. Because I am *not* functional on Cocaine! There is no valid reason to continue using speedballs. I'm forgetting little things, like, which compartment to put in the laundry detergent or noticing that I have already took out the toast whilst trying to get the toaster to release it... I took it out like half a minute before. I don't want to dissolve my brain. It's the only thing giving me a chance on a semblance of a normal life despite all the trauma and fuck ups. 




But when I go and get dope, I won't be able to orgasm and that's shitty. Coke let's me do that at least. And if I wait until after the date my dboys business hours will be over. It's just a cluster fuck. There is so much else I should be thinking of and attending to right now.

Also, how many do you guys think it would take and how often to alliviate withdrawal symptoms from a .3-.4g/day (when we can afford to get high) bth habit?

this past Friday, i ran out of my gabapentins about 2 weeks early. i had ran out before, but don't remember having trouble sleeping. i also had 86% indica oil, but that's another story. so i guess i was well equipped, unlike this time.

Then a few months later after a forced apology for calling her a drug addict, I let my guard down in August and she gobbled up all my Flexeril.

3 weeks ago she asked for a muscle relaxer and I gave it to her, she immediately drank 6 beers and continued all night.

I’m seeing my doc tomorrow and thinking about asking him for a Narcan Rx to help me stop bingeing.

Does anyone have experience with a patch? It’s supposed to be more effective than the spray because your med level is constant.

I am a long time lurker and opiate head - 23 years since my first time H dragged me in.

I want to share a harm reduction hint for snorters, mainly Hydromorph Contin or Palladon as it's called in many European countries. The same obviously applies to any other fine powder but I found it especially important with Hydromorph since those beads - when properly crushed with a mortar - really turn into such a fine powder like flour, which makes it especially bad on the lungs. 
As hopefully most of you know, insufflating fine powders can lead to silicosis (dust lung) and is really dangerous. This can happen when the powder you are snorting ends up partially in your lungs instead of the nose which is obviously more likely with fine powders.
Silicosis is not something that happens overnight but rather overtime which makes it even more dangerous.
Street drugs like Heroin, Speed or Cocaine are often (or in case of good C always) not enough powderous to pose big of a risk, but obviously depending on quality and cutting agents used can also pose a problem.

We came up with this when snorting Hydromorph since as stated above, ground Hydromorph Contin/Palladon beads ideally yields a VERY fine powder which is virtually impossible to not end up partially in your respiratory tract.
We first tried to ""close"" the route to our lungs by trying to exhale or have your mouth full of water when snorting but neither really lead to satisfying results.

We then figured that we need to get the powder less ""flourish"" by moistening and drying it - while at the same time still grinding the beads all the way fine - since only that will lead to maximal effect and bioavailability.
So we would mix a few ml water (or even better saline solution which we make ourselves by mixing few grains of salt with distilled water)  with the powder - just enough to yield a paste which dries quicker. Results were good but it took a while to dry (30-60 mins. depending on amount of water etc), and interestingly enough the powder never turns back to as fine a powder as before moistening it, even when completely dry.

We then improved it by using much less water, it suffices when you lay out the powder flat on a clean surface and spray it slightly with some water/saline solution.
After spraying we mix the powder pile with a card to make sure all of the powder is equally moist - this approach will yield a snortable powder immediately (i.e. no need to wait for drying).

Since we discovered this we enjoy our snorted Hydromorph much more since we don't have to worry about silicosis anymore - before without moistening you could feel how every line would dust up your lungs which takes away the fun of it...

Try it - you'll be surprised how easy it is and your health will thank you in the long run.

So being the good little junk box I am I hit the streets, off on another cold copping adventure.  
It didn't take me too long to find 2 guys (we'll call them L and D) standing around, looking like they hadn't washed in a week or 2 - perfect. This was far from my first time doing this, so after a quick chat and the promise of a bag they jumped in my car and directed me to the spot. We get there and they ask for my money, I laugh and tell them no. I was only spending £20 so we eventually decide that one of them would stay in the car and the other would leave his phone with me while he went and waited for the runner. I was still wary but figured eh, worst comes to worst I could probably get close to £20 for the phone anyway. Thankfully it didn't come to that, a few minutes later L jumped back in the car, drugs in hand. We swapped numbers, I dropped them back into town and went on my merry way.  
Over the next 8 months I'd see L and D almost every day, so I'd like to think we got to know each other pretty well. There were a few times I was short and they'd cover it for me, and a few times I helped them out too - all was well in my little bubble of opiates.  
Last night I went to pick them up like normal, but L wasn't there. No problem, me and D headed to the spot by ourselves (something that had never happened before). I didn't think twice giving him my money, it's the same routine I'd done with L for months. He hopped out the car... and that was the last I saw of him.  
30 minutes later I get out and go looking for him... vanished. I check the other spot they sometimes wait at, not there either. 8 months of helping each other out, spending at least an hour a day chatting, all gone for £25. What really pisses me off is if he'd just asked I'd have happily broke him off something, but instead he had to be a greedy prick and take it all for himself.

Don’t start IV’ing. It is overall the most dangerous ROA, and don’t take that as a challenge. It requires being skilled at all aspects of vein care and venipuncture, as well as sterile technique to reduce the likelihood of health problems, and even in the best of circumstances things can and DO GO WRONG, even in a hospital. So imagine what you are likely to pull off in non-sterile environment without formal training from a tech.
Mods: if this isn’t appropriate to post, please delete. I am doing this with the intention of harm reduction using information gathered from online research and my own personal experience.

Okay, that introduction was long for a reason: I needed to included all that info and to maybe weed out anyone not patient enough to read it to get to the IV’ing part. If you’re anything like I was when I first started, you’ll sacrifice your arms (and brain) in the name of getting high (science).

Syringe choice: BD (Beckton Dickson) syringes are known in the IV community for being the smoothest plunge and having the slickest needle. You should always *always* use a new pin/rig/syringe, but if you’ve ever found yourself with only a used one of your own, bleach it and use BD brand always because they’re also known for maintaining a smoother entry on second use (Not that you should, it ruins your veins and raises the likelihood of infection and vein issues). 

If you buy an all-in-one (AIO) syringe with a non-removable needle, do your veins a favor and don’t get insulin syringes. Thanks to u/GeneralCha0s for educating me on this. Why? Because insulin syringe needles are designed to dive through layers of subcutaneous tissue (Not veins)and they leave a hole, rather than a slice in the vein, which takes longer to heal and contributes to fucked up veins faster than using a hypo needle which is *designed to pierce veins*.
Yes, it will take you longer and may initially be more difficult to hit with a different rig, but in the long run, it is worth it IMO.

BARREL SIZE: If you are going to the lengths that I did (in the name of science) to find the perfect rig, I suggest detachable needles. If your hit is over 45-50 units, get a 3ml syringe barrel. The bigger your hits get, the harder it is to keep your hand steadily in one place on the syringe. (You’ll need to be careful to go slower pushing your dope in to not blow a vein, since 1/4 inch plunge on a 1cc has less force than a 1/4 inch plunge on a 3cc—I did the research on PSI’s in syringes. It’s a fact).

Anyways, in a 1cc with a giant hit, your thumb just isn’t long enough and you’ll end up creeping along the syringe like I did, missing the vein or slipping out and wasting your dope and hurting yourself in the process.

If you have long fingers or a ring on the end of the plunger, different story. Carry on. Smaller than 50 units can stick with a 1cc/ml.
Also, make sure on any rig, to prime the barrel. This is a medical thing that means taking the plunger and pushing it in and out to make the plunge smoother before you draw up.

NEEDLES: think of this as being like the fork you eat with (yes, please eat). You wouldn’t eat a bowl of cereal with a fork if you had a spoon. Don’t use insulin syringes or needles for veins. They’re not meant for veins. You’ll spill your cereal/milk trying to hobgobble the shit in your mouth (vein).

BD needles are the best, hands down. Some ppl prefer Terumo if you’re not in the States, which is good also, but I already mentioned why I like BD’s. 

LENGTH: If you have fresh veins that are relatively shallow, go for 1/2” to 5/8” needles. You’re less likely to puncture through the back wall of the vein (I hear stories a lot of people swearing they’re in the vein because it registers, but feeling burning). This is why. Puncturing all the way through a vein, registering while pulling out, and putting the dope in will make it look like you’re there when you’re Not. The result is a fucked up vein that may not heal and a pocket of dope that may  abscess.

For scarred or deep veins, go for a longer needle (not my thing, maybe someone can chime in on the length & gauge).

GAUGE: in general, the smaller the needle, the better. Less damage overall if you’re shooting clear or H but if you’ve got a thick shot, a slightly bigger gauge will work a bit better. Most can fit just fine through 30g.

They do make needles that are 27g with a wide bore (just means the hole is bigger for the dope to get through without putting a bigger hole in your vein). Check it out.

Once I started using the right equipment, I had much better highs, less, wasted dope and no misses. A miracle for this dope fiend. I do have a lot of info on aftercare, but I’ve made this post long enough.

TL;DR, use the device that gets you there with the least damage so you can keep getting high without moving to your neck, groin or other dangerous sites. Bonus: when you quit, your veins are likely to heal much more quickly.

Edit: FWIW I used to be a phlebotomist.

Edit 2: I used insulin syringes for years but couldn’t make them work for me the past year. This is why I went Bill Nye the Science Guy all up in this bitch.",1517061744.0

Basically he has been clean from opiates for 3 months after a pretty much straight year of using. He decided to use tonight and was super high and feeling great for a few hours then he started throwing up violently and has a migraine like headache. Its been going on the last four or five hours. He cant keeo anything down and is just moaning in agony.
This has happened to me as well after picking up black tar heroin after being sober off opiates for some time. 
Is this common?? Seems to only be with tar though. It happened to me in LA multiple times over a two year span and now its happening to my buddy in Portland so i think it must have something to do with tar in general  

If this has happened to you, whats best to help? Im usually sick for an entire day after and then feel perfectly fine. Im hoping he is not sick that long, however. Using more does not seem to help so i havent let him use since his initial dose which wasnt even much.

I plan on going to buy some weed in the am because thats the only thing i can think of that wont do more harm than good. I have a lot of gatorade but he cant keep it down and dehydration just makes the symptoms way worse.

I saw Cliff's sister walking her dog so I gave her money for six subs at standard face value. Then later on, an hour later she called me to verify the order and then called again thirty minutes later to tell me she got it. Wow, that was quick.


Cliff owed me so he gave me some of his script. This time the roxy 15s were not green but white. Never saw white oval shaped roxies before. They still work the same though form what I can tell. Maybe I should try that new loop straw that someone psted the other day. Never had trouble with my lungs before from snorting and I'm hoping to stop soon but never hurts to reduce harm in them mean time I suppose.

&nbsp;

So anyway, before work today I visit Cliff's to get the pills he owes me and to check on his sister to see if she was home to give me my subs.

Her friend, Danika was there just coming in with the dog. She mentioned to me that she just picked up 90 subs form her doctor and that she's trying to sell. When she realized her friend Cliff's sister got me subs from someone else she was upset because ""she knew I (Danika) needed the money.""

Danka then sprang into talking mad shit. ""I paid $300 to fix up the walls in that room then she let DJ move in for $125 per week."" You see, a couple of months ago she was in that room with some big African American dude (Danika's a white chick with thinning hair) and she gave me $10 that she knew I could spend on something I could find a connect. The $10 was given to me so that I'd fix a ripped power cord. So I rigged it and earned those ten bux.

In between getting tools from other rooms for the job, the door kept getting locked and I ahd to wait outside the door. She was either blowing this guy, or doing coke, H, PCP, or something else. Like I said, despite those delays I was successful.

A day later she was kicked out for prostituting herself in Cliff's house which Cliff's sister didn't appreciate. 

&nbsp;

Back to today she's in the house and Danika is saying ""Cliff's sister was jealous of me because I had an older man hanging around taking care of me... she texted and said I was mad ugly..."" 

She then went on to mention the time (the one time out of eight) where Cliff's sister had $60 of mine for subs that got stolen because the sub connect ran with the money and didnt' come back the following day because of ""snow"". Danika speculated that maybe it was true but felt more strongly about the possibility that money was owed to that connect and this was how the connect got it back from her.

&nbsp;

Well anyway, despite me being re-stocked in fresh subs, Danika insisted on giving me a free sub. ""Do you want a pill or a strip?"" She woudln't take no for an answer so I took the strip.

She then said that if I ever needed any I can get a credit up to three days in advanced and that she'd sell me 15 of them at a good discount. Furthermore I wouldn't have to pre-pay her for them so transactions would happen in real time.

Danika further speculated that Cliff's sis was making money by getting me my subs. I don't know if that's true unless the sub connect was charging her less than normal street price which I'm fine with as long as the profit motivates her to get the subs quickly and without fail.

&nbsp;


Not sure why Danika insisted on giving me a free sub.

&nbsp;

Later on while I was away, Danika got into a fight with some guy outside. Was making mad noise. Cliff said he stayed inside and wouldn't get involved. Then Danika came knocking on his door and was like bugging and black and blue. Complained that nobody would come out and help... She was also asking for me but who knows why. Tech help?

&nbsp;

Hours later Danika had pain in her stomach and an ambulance came to pick her up. Cliff's sister needed to use my phone when I came up stairs to check who got in the ambulance and to make sure it wasn't Cliff's sister. So after making some phone calls and trying to get some update info on the situation she asked to borrow my bicycle. My $700+ bike. She wanted to go somewhere two miles away to knock on Danika's man's door to do something or get some update.. IDK. 

I said I needed to check something, reminded her that she cold contact my phone if she needed me and got the fuck out. 

The idea of loaning my bike out is a risk I'd prefer to avoid taking. If that shit disappeared she wouldn't be able to replace it and I'd have a terrible day, week, month....... It was once speculated that I'd kill myself if that happened. Probably not, but I'd feel awfully shitty. 

Hope Danika feels better, and glad I got what I paid for today since it is a critical part of my plan. To have more than enough subs to get me to my next pay cycle. By which point I will either have insurance and a photo ID or a photo ID and money from my next pay check to see a sub doc. Then I can be sub human :p",1517049261.0

I have no idea where else to go for advice. I'm just trying to not be in pain and also not come across as drug seeking. For years this has just been a joke in my family about how pain killers do not work on me, but now that I'm getting older - and the pain is becoming much more common - I just need some advice.

I need to know how to explain to doctors that I'm in pain, I'm not drug seeking, and the normal first-line level of opiate-based pain management is flat out useless on me.

I have never used any opiate for fun. I'm certainly not one to look down on anyone for chosing to do so. Just saying I don't have that opiate use as a background to explain the tolerance. 

---

Even after having my wisdom teeth removed, and the oral surgeon had to keep increasing my dosage to the point he was afraid I'd have respiratory problems, my surgeon was utterly stunned that I wasn't outright anesthetized much less able to feel pain. I'm not even remotely sure how to address this. The surgeon asked me to come in and chat, asked if I'd taken the medication - and upon saying yes - was just stunned.

That was my only time ever being anesthetized and I'd managed to count back from 100 down to 80 before the anesthesiologist said ""well I guess he was right,"" adjusted some things, and I was out when I got to 65.

I'm seriously not even trying to get high or to even feel good. I'm just trying to be able to go to work without having screaming pain. But since apparently this is rare, and of course the ""opioid epidemic"" makes doctors wary to prescribe.

I have a history of all kinds of painful infections (all non-drug related) that required pain management just to get through my day. I used to be able to just call my primary care doctor, even after hours, and explain what's going on - and they'd call in a script for the standard antibiotic we needed to manage the infection plus 10mg hydrocodone w/o APAP because for me that's basically like taking acetaminophen. Of course that's not doable ever since hydrocodone was made schedule 2, but frankly hydrocodone doesn't even seem to do much of anything to me anymore.

That's not hyperbole, either. 10mg of hydrocodone for me seems to be the same kind of analgesia an average person gets from 500mg of acetaminophen.

A doctor telling me to take an NSAID or acetaminophen to help pain is pointless for me unless there's swelling the NSAID will actually deal with, and in those cases the NSAID's effect is paltry compared to an actual steroid. E.g. if I twist my ankle and it swells up I need a steroid shot, not oral steroids, to bring that swelling down. Dropping my pants and getting a huge steroid shot in my butt is something I've literally asked for more than once because I know it's the only thing that will work to bring my sprained joint back to normal.

Which gets to the crux of my problem.

The last time I saw my doctor for managing this chronic condition they'd perform a small amount of surgery on my skin and even with 4+ vials (I am not exaggerating) of lidocaine it would be all I could do to bare it. I'd grit my teeth and try my damnedest to deal with it - I honestly through about asking for a bite guard because my teeth were hurting from biting so hard - and trying to hold back from crying. For days afterward any wrong move would leave me yelping in pain and crying. My wife would come back, let me lean on her, and give me time to get my breath back because the pain was so sharp I couldn't even breathe. This usually lasts 3-4 days after the procedure.

And if you're wondering - yes the procedure is necessary. I've been dealing with this for almost a year now and I'm just so goddamned tired of being in pain and crying from it.

Maybe I'm a wuss, but holy fuck I have no idea how to handle this.

Because everything I've read, everything I'm told, is that basically the pain shouldn't be this bad. The doctor isn't doing anything wrong - I've researched the hell out of the treatments and watched the doctor perform it: everything the doctor & nurses do is 100% textbook. I've even consulted with other doctors about the proper treatment protocol to make sure everything is being done correctly.

My current doctor has written me a script for tramadol, I've taken a large amount (200mg), and had zero effect on me. I can only assume I lack the liver enzyme that turns tramadol into desmetramadol. Since tramadol has effectively no affinity for opioid receptors tramadol does nothing to help pain for me.

I have another treatment coming up in a couple weeks and I'm completely afraid of it because I can't deal with it again. I'm completely terrified and want to cancel the appointment, but for my own well being that's not an option. Last time I was in there for the procedure I broke an arm rest on the side of the exam table from gripping and pulling on it so hard trying my best to not move - I literally sheared a piece of steel in half from gripping and pulling on it so hard - and I assure you I'm no body builder.

----

**How do I convince my doctor that my pain is sincere, that the normal treatments aren't working, and do all of this without coming across as drug-seeking?**

I am utterly 100% terrified of a doctor writing ""drug seeking"" on my medical record.

My life was the way it always was as a junkie.  You know what I'm talking about.  I walked like 10 miles a day minimum, because this place had no public transit, not even a taxi cab service.  A lot of hippies lived there so thumbing a ride wasn't out of the question, but I was a junkie, so I walked everywhere.  And everywhere was way, way, way spread out, like super far away from everything else.  It was a desert town so there was no shortage of space when they planned housing.  
Anyway, at this same time, I was known at one of the local coffee shops as a junkie by the hippies who frequented it and owned it.  They didn't necessarily hate me for being a junkie per se but they did hate me for this one time they caught me stealing an organic fruit rollup and shooting up in their bathroom.  The owner literally used to chase me to the bathroom and bang on the door screaming that, ""IT BETTER SMELL LIKE SH*T WHEN I GET IN THERE!!!!!""  
I still hung out in their courtyard anyway and one night, after a day of walking and walking and walking and getting a few good shots of black out of it, I was starving and dying for a warm place to sleep.  These hippies who had known me somewhat before I relapsed and definitely knew me now took me home.  It was a woman's house.  She was fat but very pretty and probably 27 or so with 4 kids.  She made money as a seamstress or whatever she did and wore cockroach killer cowboy boots and a straw cowboy hat.  At her house, which was the way things were for most hippied out single mothers in the town, there lived four or five other grown men and women full time.  Outside of that there was an influx of anywhere between 10 and 2 people.  This night I can't remember how many there were, maybe 12 of us besides her and her kids, but I had never been there before.  I only knew like one guy's name and another girls name, but there I was all nodded out and hungry and getting stared at hard between these hippies all beating on their drums and passing joints, which I sucked down every chance I got.  They would laugh at me for taking such big hits like, ""This dude is definitely a mooch.  He's just trying to smoke the whole joint every time he gets a hit.""  They were right.  I was selfish.
So anyway, the single mother in her cowboy boots and cowboy hat has baked like two whole oven racks of chicken breast.  It's beautiful, golden brown, salted and greasy.  
I'm not sure exactly what they were waiting for.  They didn't say grace.  They weren't Christians.  Maybe they were waiting for the rest of it to be done, like some other part of the dinner, baked potatoes I don't know, but they were all just waiting politely to start eating the chicken.  
Well I wake up out of this hard nod and walk right over to the pans with all this chicken waiting to be feasted on and I grab some a breast with my bare hand and start mowing down right there.  Grease was running down my chin.  I'm sure I was making a ton of noise.  I ate several more pieces before anyone else even stood up to get one.  They were all looking at me like, ""What the F, dude?  Who are you and why did you eat our chicken like that you selfish piece of crap?""  
I'm hungry is what I would have said. Or maybe I'm the perpetually nodding chicken man?  I do'n tknow what I would have said, but I just walked to the back and found a mattress and crashed out until the morning.  When I woke up I walked back to town with one of the only two people I knew there, my pregnant friend Wendy.     ",1517036842.0

I'm just wondering if anyone has heard about heroin causing strange reactions like this recently.  I haven't used in almost 10 years, and I certainly recall some stuff that seemed to cause a kind of cotton fever, regardless of whether or not you switched out your works, also stuff that seemed to be cut with coke and would give you a rush that felt like it had a coke-edge to it, but nothing that made people hallucinate or act really strangely.

I smoked a point to the face and then felt real nice for a few minutes before getting violently ill. I spent the next hours nodding off, whining in tongues and puking. I'm just glad I didn't shoot up, I could have very well been dead now.

Back to square one. At the very least I only spent like 50 bucks and didn't use enough to get physically hooked again.

TL;DR: fuck a relapse, that shit wasn't even pleasant. You'll just feel guilty and shitty. Call up some old friends and vent out your frustrations over pricey pub-booze like a normoid instead.",1516993132.0

For 2 years i’ve been using a product that is kowingly an unknown Fent analogue suspected to be **Furayl-Fentanyl** mixed with heroin.

When i began i would get dope sick 10 hours after being dry.  Intense symptoms.

I then introduced **subutex** to my life *pretending* to get clean but really would just use it as a safety net.
I would run out of gear and dose 2mg for the 4 day waiting for fix. 

**Then something happened...**

I stopped subutex without any problems first of all... when subutex was out of my system and life, i continue using the heroin product...

 **Now, and since then,  i’ve been using and running out continually without any sign of withdrawals.. **zero. 
NONE!**

When i finish my bag, i can go 4 days in complete health, health like someone not on drugs, full sleep, energy, no symptoms, until i score again.

Does anyone know what this is? Could it be an unknown fent analogue that somehow ligers in the body so long that it prevents sickness?

**Ive never gone longer than 5 days without, that would be the challenge and experiment, but those 5 days i am in zero discomfort as opposed to High temp, RLS and vomit 10 hours after occuring at first usage — as mentioned above**

anyone? so rad, so bizarre. ",1516989052.0

I’m trying to figure out what exactly happened so if anyone can conclude something from this, that would be awesome.

Well if you go check my post from yesterday you can see that I was having trouble finding rigs, but needless to say, I was able to purchase some this morning.

Okay so I’ve been using once a week usually, maybe once every two weeks(just wanted to give an idea of where my tolerance is), and I snorted like a point last night. I must say, before ever doing the dope, I was feeling a bit off...maybe just a little cold or something. And I wasn’t able to fall asleep. 

Fast forward to this morning and I get my rigs. I IVd maybe 40mg, which is a normal amount that I’m used to. Also I hadn’t eaten this morning (maybe that’s important to the story). It’s starting to kick in and about and I notice  feeling weird psychologically. Like something just didn’t feel quite right, and I think I was kinda scared so I remember just trying to walk around to stay moving. 

All I remember from there is waking up on the floor next to my bed with a bloody gash next to my eye. I must’ve fell down and hit my head on the bed frame. I kinda felt slow, like just stupider lol.

There’s so many factors to this that I’m having trouble figuring out whether I ODd or just passed out from lack of sleep. Either way, I got a gash next to my eye and knot on the back of my head.

Pretty scared to think the possibility of an OD, never had that happen before. I’m kinda shook up from this

Edit: So conclusion is it was an OD. And I have thought many many times what it would be like to OD and it was not like it at all. I expected an overdose to make you feel really heavy and weighed down as if gravity were twice as much. I can’t really describe it to a T, but it was more like a weird type of anxiety followed by blacking out.

Edit 2: thank you all so much for the advice and experience. Now I realize just how serious this was and I could have very easily died today. This will be a good motivator to give up opiates.",1516988733.0

I have severe mental illness. I have a relentless brain disorder which causes many of the same symptoms of benzo withdrawal. My nerves are constantly on fire, I'm shaky, anxious, and extremely depressed. I have a shit job making barely above minimum wage and I despise where I live. Both my parents and grandparents are dead and I hate the rest of my family except for a couple. I have no friends. I have a girlfriend who I love but I love drugs more than her apparently. 

.         . My life is a fucking mess and I'm in constant pain everyday due to my brain being so fucked up. I want to give up. I've been clean for 12 days after a one week relapse. I don't give a shit anymore. If this is life I don't want to live it, I feel like I'm constantly getting worse and worse. Everyday is worse than the last. Even though I'm not physically withdrawaling from opiates, I'm mentally being tortured. I want to relapse so bad today. I want to end this suffering if only so briefly. I want to become reckless and fuck over any and everybody I can just to stay high. I would even suck dick for money at this point. Whatever keeps the constant flow of drugs in my system. I'm desperate for this physical, emotional, mental pain to stop. 

.        . I want to drive to the hood today, my old stomping grounds, and just soak it all in. Remember when times were good. Before I had this brain injury, before I moved away from my beloved city. I want to use today more than anything. Honestly, I don't even want to use, I just don't want to be in pain anymore.

There are annecdotal news reports that Bromadol has been found in the heroin supply in Middle America. 
There is very little information on the substance, it has never been tested on humans and the potency was suggested to be thousands x morphine (similar to carfentanil). 
I don't know anything about the chemical structure of it or how powerful it really is, but it is being sold by Chinese RC vendors and I worry it is a matter of time before it appears out on the street. 
Anyone used it or know anything?",1516987282.0
