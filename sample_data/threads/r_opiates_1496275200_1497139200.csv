Got clean in time for Christmas 2016, cold turkeyed it through the festivities. Talk about a blast, eh?

Anyway, one month into my sobriety stint, I start feeling better. Sleeping well, and I finally gather the motivation to do stuff other than veg out on the couch. Long walks, reading a lot, eating well.

All this time, my reward system thought of exactly one thing. Heroin. I live in a country with #3, so I dreamed of prepping a shot and I couldn't even walk past Vit C in the supermarket without feeling the drive of addiction.

Anyway, yesterday I caved. I picked up some dope and in the world's most pathetic compromise decided to stick to smoking for the time being. Not wanting to dive back into the needle, I enjoyed the smoking ritual for the first time in three years. Tinfoil, a tooter and blowing fat funky clouds. It's working well so far, smoking works perfectly fine after an extended Tolly break.

Just thought I'd share. Anyone else ever downgrade from shooting?",1496332277.0

Meh. I have a series of these withdrawal posts. I don't seem to have learned much, despite my efforts.

But this time feels different. There's a motivation for something else, for once. I have repeated the cycle enough to see what it all entails, and checking it at what seems like the worst can be quite helpful.


There's a group of people who need to be narcotized. Make it available, All the safe clean free heroin you want. But you're watched like a tick. Go up to a window. Check in. It's not a thrill anymore. It's bullshit.

I'm trying man. It's all bullshit, but the dope thang aint workin. I want more.

Physical symptoms: low grade intensity, 24 hours a day, alternating between sore legs and vague hints of sobriety through the insomnia haze to the full-on descending into a psychedelic trip or psychotic episode feeling, neuropathy, gi upset, inability to rest or find comfort in any physical setting. 

All expected.

The cold turkey thing was a little rash, but it was time and it felt right. I would reccommend getting a little lower in the mg before making the jump, just for recovery sake.

My question is how much water should I drink before the test I know the b 12 for color trick but thats not an issue they have never questioned the color. Im also not worried about drinking to much and it coming back diluted. I wheigh about 160 and im 5'9"".

&nbsp;
Alright! Hey just checking in, not that I assume you guys care lots, but I'm really stoked. So I smoked the last of my shit yesterday at 7pm and woke up this morning in sweats, toss and washed a tablespoon of kratom and went back to sleep for a half an hour. Woke up feeling actually pretty normal, just a bit tired. So I redosed kratom a couple of time while at work today and other than being tired with a bit of blurry vision I haven't had much in the way of withdrawal symptoms.

&nbsp;
After work I went to the hood to pick up native smokes, and any benzos/subs I can find and this guy says ""hey man, how are you doing?"" and I say ""fuck, not great"" and he says ""well I got subs and dillies!"" so I ended up copping 5 x 8mg suboxone pills for $40! Not a bad deal around here, but I've never actually tried them. I'm starting to feel withdrawals now but I'm going to tough them out and not pop my first sub until tomorrow morning just to make sure I don't go into PWD's, and I figure I should be a-ok for the camping trip with this stash. 

&nbsp;
Just wanted to share my good mood with you guys, doesn't look like I will be fucking this weekend up or pissing my girlfriend off by sneaking hits of H to stay well. And I'm only going to use the subs for a few days and do a quick taper with them and then ride it out with the rest of my kratom. AND keep my fucking nose clean and party oldschool with booze and weed like before I ever went down this road. I don't hate opiates or blame them for anything that's gone wrong in my life, I just obviously can't handle them.

In the summer they're really intense because they are triggered by thunderstorms, and I need something stronger to get relief.

I've been on 5/325 Percocet for about 20 years and Tramadol 50 mg for about 2 years. It's just not enough to touch the bad ones anymore. Should I be looking for a bigger dose of oxycodone, or maybe hydrocodone or Demerol? 

I get that opioids are different strengths so with an adjusted dose you can have the same morphine mg equivalent but I find that Advil works well for me and Toradol does nothing, even though they are both NSAIDs. Are opiates the same?

All advice, links, thoughts, gratefully received! 

**Edit:** I have and use triptans - Imitrex is actually least effective, with Zomig and Frova being my go-tos.  I have a Cefaly machine, injectable Gravol, love Advil Migraine and have Botox injections with my neurologist every 10 weeks. I'm talking about an opioid to use once or twice a month when the pain is so bad I can't bear it, nothing is helping, and having something on hand would keep me from having to go to the emergency room.

Thoughts on taking birth control (estrogen/progesterone) to mitigate effects of low E?","Opiates inhibit hypothalamic Gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which as the *GONAD* in *gonad*otropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) leads to the gonads (ovaries-F/testes-M) to stop releasing sex hormones= estrogen in females and testosterone in males. 

PST caused it in me. Have had labs. Abruptly stopped having periods 6 months ago after 13 years of regular periods.

Since estrogen and progesterone lead to build up of endometrial lining and their absence leads to subsequent shedding (menstruation).... 

Not producing estrogen (well, not producing a follicle technically, follicular cells= make/secrete estrogen) due to opiate inhibition of hypothalamus GnRH (which then leads to no stimulation of LH and FSH release by pituitary).... 

Means no periods.

So: hormone replacement is common. 
 
##**How about birth control to replace low estrogen?**

Where else can I post this if r/opiates isn't the best community? :) thanks!

**TL;DR:** Opiates stop estrogen release which stops menstruation (and leads to low-estrogen problems such as osteoporosis, fatigue, decreased collagen synthesis--> older women stuff). I have low E after starting PST. Can I take E in the form of birth control to mitigate things.

**TL;DR (science/mechanism/nerds<3opiates):**

GnRH (hypothalamus)---> LH/FSH (a. pituitary)---> ovaries (FSH= follicle with egg; follicle= ESTROGEN; LH=ovulate)---> corpus luteum(empty egg sac/egg gone to fallopian tube--> CL produces more estrogen and progesterone---> too long to continue ;p",1496275230.0

And now I'm here. 

I was body building with a fiery passion after kicking a heavy xanax addiction ~2.5 years ago. In that time frame I learned how to lift, gain weight, lose weight, how to properly eat, and became a certified personal trainer at the biggest gym in my area. 21 years young and loving it. With heavy lifting came occasional body aches and pains, and I was already familiar with painkillers by this time, I had abused them through my benzo abuse and on random occasion, one time binging on methadone without any insight into the upcoming withdrawal that would leave me flailing in my bed for two weeks. When I kicked the xanax, I didn't stop selling it. Joint task force of a local PD and the DEA came raining down on my parade and popped me and my partner for possession, intent to distribute controlled substance, and conspiracy to commit crime. Here I am 2 years and a few months later, without a single charge, court appearance, or anything. The Feds dropped the case and the state hasn't done anything yet.. they even gave me back my firearms... all 7 of them. One more year and that all permanently disappears. Once this happened I went on for about 6 months staying completely clean and sober from anything, and did a rehab program to claim to the courts I was an addict, it was also my first offense. This also happened in a rich white neighborhood, and I immediately had high paid representation. Thank god. During my 6 months clean is when I began my body building. From then until now, I have went from a 135 lb stick to a cut up 175 lbs. I was on track to do a competition, but I had started using opiates again every once in a while. I had compressed the L5 disc in my spine and have back pain, and would occasionally justify the drug usage with this in mind. Though I had those 6months clean, my tolerance returned to its precious place rather quickly, my first high was off some T3 codeine pills (LOL), but taking 5 or so at a time only got me high a couple times, spaced apart. I quickly climbed the ladder back to what I was familiar using, copping blues or OP40's every weekend. Even with days in between usage, it got to the point where 160mg would hardly give me a buzz, I would potentiate my highs every so often with 1-4mg xanax. Then I was introduced to heroin. I could now get my same high for $40 instead of $150. Sweet. 

Not. 

Wow. 
I've never caught myself changing from a drug as fast as I have with heroin. (Haven't tried meth, don't plan on it) I had become someone I certainty am NOT. At all. I would lie to my girlfriend who I love so much or my family about little and pointless things so I could leave for a bit to go buy my dope, or would lie about where I had been, why I was late, who was I with, ANYTHING. I hate lying more than anything I couldn't stand it. On top of this my ambition had been snuffed out like a flame, my drive to accomplish my goal, my appetite and nurtution fell on my priority list, days off from the gym turned into weeks into months. I would battle with myself and get clean for 3,4,5 up to 7 days, then justified getting high as a 'reward' just once, then back to another week clean. Nope. It was never just once. 

Now here I am, 5 months after meeting heroin, and just at a loss of words. There's in no point to this story, but maybe it will help someone else realize they should get out while it's early, while they can, or help prevent someone from starting. It's like 5 months ago I just pressed pause on all things important in my life. Luckily I can still hit the play button again. So can you. So can anyone stuck in an addiction, it's never too late. You have to reflect on your life. Think about before you ever started using, where did you see yourself going? Were you the next Real Estate Mogul, leading app developer, working for apple, google, maybe an entrepreneur to your own business? You can still accomplish that. Turn your energy towards that. Write down your goals. If you think about using dope, then read your goals. Make a plan and execute to work towards them. It won't happen over night, but it CAN HAPPEN!! MAKE IT HAPPEN!! I know I'm going to. 

I'm headed to the gym right now. I'm changing everything. Im not just preaching this, I am practicing it as well. I started my Real Estate License classes, found a new apartment and signed the lease, moving in next week, planned a trip to Vegas this weekend to enjoy myself and friends and transition back to who I am, and I signed back up for a full schedule of college courses. 

You can lose your life to dope, and die. 
You can lose your life to dope, and also still be very much alive. 

I am stronger. I am courageous. I am dedicated. I am ambitious. I am motivated. I am alive and living. Join me. 

TL;DR 
Story about how my life was affected by heroin in a short 5 months, and how I realized I needed to make a change. Maybe this will help someone else decide not to start opiates, or get out before it's too late. 

Update - just killed my workout. Not nearly as intense or heavy as I was lifting at the beginning of this year, but not terrible. I can still bench press 185 for sets of 10 so I'm happy about that. My muscles are achey and cramping and tired, 60 hours after my last dose now, dosed 2mg sub around 12:00 today. Feels great to lift again, I'm comin back bigger and stronger than ever before. Now time to smoke, eat, and go train some private clients I have.

I realize this is a lot of money for most people but the beauty is there are other coins in the market referred to Altcoins. These other coins are beginning to surge up in price. For example one of these coins is called etherium. It was 8 bucks in January and went to 150 last week and today it's about 230 for one.

Also you do not need to purchase the entire coin to invest in them, you can buy a fraction of the coins for example you can buy 20 bucks worth of them at a time. There are other coins that you can buy for literally 1 cent as well. Some of these  coins will eventually raise up in price 10-100x's that amount over the next months or year.

If you wanted to buy these coins you go on an exchange for these coins and buy them at that rate and hold on to them until they raise in price. 

This terminology of coins is called cryptocurrency which is a booming market and possibly the future of money. A lot of people are starting to realize this, if you wanted to get into the market YouTube cryptocurrency, poloneix, altcoins or any other coin name and there are tons of good videos on these. 

Also here is one link that has all the cryptocurrencies and of you click on them ou can see their growth charts.

Coinmarketcap.com is a good link to see the currencies and then make your decision ifnyou want to do it. In February this market was around 20billion dollars and now it is around 80 billion.

So basically I was on a three day adderall binge when these two thoughts popped into my mind. Firstly, where's the opium at? You know the original opioid it seems like the best experience of any opioid I've researched. I've had opioids that are stronger than opium but they never really satisfy me. I don't know if I'm making any sense but when I'm sniffing hydros or popping percs like candy I don't get that functional good feeling high. I have dreams of putting on a silk robe lounging on my back deck laying back on my recliner on my deck and sparking up a pipe full of opium.

       Opium seems perfect easy to dose, mild and it has that habitual ritual of smoking. You see when I pop a pill/rail it I don't have that satisfying feeling of hitting a pipe and relaxing.

       now its time for me to get back to my point where has all the opium gone. My guess is big Pharma pretty much runs the illegal opioid market and they know it. Just look at how sales drop once the company who owned the rights to OxyContin make them so they can't be shot.

The imprint on them was an E and a 7, and they were the same green most 15s are. I only started of by railing half of one which is well within my tolerance, but it hit me pretty hard which felt great for a little while but then after about 20 mins I got pretty nauseous with cold sweats. After a little while I decided to try another half which also hit me pretty hard but I didn't think much of it until this morning when my friend who has a much higher tolerance than me mentioned they were unusually strong for him too which made me jump to the conclusion that they might contain Fent or H. I feel okay at the moment but I'm worried that I've been ingesting something I didn't intend to. Does this sound like I might have gotten some fake pills or am I just being paranoid about it?

I used to post occasionally cause sometimes you're the only people I can talk to about this shit. But anyway...

So today started off pretty great. Had some cash in the morning, hit up da boy. No answer. Don't put him on blast, but at the same time I'm like wtf? Hit him up, like, 4-5 times over the course of the day. Nothing. 

Give up on that little tiny shot of hope for this huge day at work I had ahead. I work in a kitchen and we were expecting a larger than average crowd tonight. Possibly record breaking and having a little dope/caffeine in my system would increase my game ten-fold on a clutch night like tonight. 

Whatever it ain't no deal. Drank a slightly larger than average ""elixir of life"" tea. Better product than I was expecting? Idk. But I actually felt a little high on the EOL, and took a two hour nap. I had been up since 3 PM the day prior. And have now been up since 3 PM when I woke up from my nap. It is 4:08 AM now (gotta get up at 8:30 AM and go back to it for a couple hours but then I get a break for a the rest of the day).

Go to work and just absolutely fucking kill it. Everybody killed it. There were 8-10 of us and we were all in our zone. 4 PM-11 PM was a constant incoming of food and appetizer tickets. Serving people and making foods and the whole-nine is a tough job with a lot of shit going on. Whatevs make 100+ in tips for a 6 hour shift. Fuckin sweet!

My girl hits up da boy at 8 ish and he immiediately hits her back up like ""watcha need?""  I'm like wtf? This motherfucker ghosted me all day. He's got his own girl he has at his side 24/7 so I'm not worried like that. It's just, why the fuck you ghosting me man? Anyway with the cash I had we were able to get a decent stash (for us). 7 pts for a ridiculous amount of money I don't even WANT to talk about spending on such a small amount of pure bliss. 

We get home get nice and high and continue to have an awesome night until just now when she passed out next to me. We just talked for a couple hours. But it was like really talked, and engaged with each other, and shared ideas, and it really felt like we were sharing our souls with each other. 

Anyways this gets me to Earl Sweatshirt. I'm sitting on the porch smoking a cigarette thinking about this 23 year-old rapper (same age as me which comes with whole bunch of different connotations on its own). Especially his last album. Those of you who have listened to Earl and really get down with him know that he talks about popping xannies, smoking blunts, and possibly pk's. I can't really remember the specifics to any particular song, phrase, or like, theme about pk's in his music but it's very possible that he has and I'm just missing something (If anybody knows of a verse where he mentions or gives a nod to pk's throw it on comment. I really wanna know!). But anyway my theory is that either A) Earl is already and opiate addict, or B) he has a very high potential of becoming an/a Ba) total pill-fiending addict Bb) junky. 

Well anyways that's it for my day. I haven't written something like this up in a while. It feels really good. Hope ya'll had a great motherfucking day and may luck and good-will find its way to you.

I made a previous post saying I would post photos of the confirmed Fent presses, and overall mystery presses in my area.. I been real busy with my LEGAL private owned/operated business the past few days, so I never got around to figuring out the whole picture thing... 

Anyway, story is... See I always have scripts of real blues on deck, whether it be my own script, or one of the many people I sponsor each month, and I cash out on there whole scripts on most of them but whatever.. Anyway, with that being said, point being is I always have real pharm blues to compare to fakes, so it's even easier for me to spot fakes off the street, than from solely just my experience.. I've been in the game since the pill mill days where in full effect.. Although that shit came to a stop real fuckin quick, there's still quite a few around you just have to have connections, the cash, and means to do so... Scripts are still achievable my people you just gotta play ur cards right an have proper documentation (MRI's/CT scans/X-ray, history of conditions/diagnoses,etc..) so I know my shit as far as legit pharm presses go.. Trust me i see a lot of berries every month lol.. 

Anyway, there's fake Mbox's going around that are legit Fent pressed... The way you can tell is the box around M is slightly thinner in and less deeply pressed, as well as the edges of the box around the M are sharp square edges instead of the gently beveled edges of the box on the real Mallinkrodt press.. The M is slightly thinner and the points of M are altered slightly.. The 3 on the 30 on back side is ever so slightly off from the normal.. 

I have a picture of a side by side comparison of a photo I took myself, for your harm reduction, an warning to make sure you know the difference... I've tried one(smoked) that way I could take it slow.. An shit got me fucked up like crazy off just about 2/3 thru smoking one Berry (my tolerance is 150-240mg a day)... I'll admit I sold a few to few friends/some customers an they all really liked them an ones with heavy tolerance couldn't really tell a difference cuz I mix all manufactures presses in each pack.. An a friend of mine with a light tolerance compared to me, he did one in the car as I did a A, an he told me he could clearly tell it was much stronger.. So after that, anytime I was dry on my scripts, I would make sure when I fucked with my plug on 50/100 packs I would make him take any of those specific M presses out an exchange them for anything but them.. He would never admit to it or ever acknowledge the difference because the organizations plan was to put around 5 an less than 10 of each of the fakes in each 100pac they sold, each being mixed with A/k/M/V mainly an sometimes a51/ALG/e8 an some of the less popular mfg.'s.. He barely speaks good English an only been in country 5 years from cuba so that's why he acted to weird about admitting the fakes.. But I'm really cool with him like we on friend level cuz we do so much biz u feel me.. 

Anyway I hope the pics show up, sorry for the rant.. Im just a little geeked up lol been smokin a few blues an snorted 2 earlier.. Got that puro perico RAWW coke an about a HP of indoor gas left.. Shit I hope all my opiate/opioid people havin a good night, and be eazy stay safe!!! You've been warned..

I had regular guys but if they weren't around, I'd fuck with the people at the known hubs. 95% of the time I'd score something, but occasionally I'd get sold a bunk bag. 

One time this guy sold me actual street tar, like asphalt. The bags felt right, smelled like vinegar and I didn't realize what was up until I got it in my spoon and it wouldn't break down. 

Another time I got a rolled up piece of nylon soaked in vinegar and tied up tight in a piece of grocery bag. That time it was night and it looked right and came from a dude I'd picked up from before. Again I didn't notice until I got home. I went back to the corner looking to fight the dude because I'm the biggest goddamn idiot in the world. He was gone but I complained to a regular guy and he pitched me a teener for a discount, so it kinda made up for getting burned on the dime. 

I had a whole customer-service attitude about it. I was like, ""you know I don't have to come to this corner right? I bring good money here and if y'all are going to fuck with me I can just as easily head to the tenderloin."" No one was impressed with my grandiose threats but like I mentioned, I could usually leverage it into a deal. 

I always thought the burn bag was a weird thing. It's so much effort for $10-20, plus I'll never buy from them again. In my day I was a pretty steady income stream for the right dude.

I waited a bit longer than usual between dosing, and I was already getting goosebumps and sneezing when I left my house today is payday and I wanted to make sure my boss wasn't anywhere near my job when I went in to go get my check and deposit it. If you are wondering why I would wait so long until my boss was gone, you can look at my post history, the last two posts I made invloved her being really rude to me and her bringing her child into work and letting him run around like a little brat. Also, I am a very quiet non-confrontational person and when I don't like someone I want to avoid them and any situation that would put us into conflict, that's why I waited so long.

So I got my check and hit up my dgirl to set things up, and she tells me she's at the gas station nearby, and she had my usual amount on her because she knew that I was going to hit her up that day. After I got the confirmation, my whole body started shaking really badly and my stomach lurched and cramped so bad, it felt like being on a roller coaster and being stabbed in the guts at the same time. I ended up throwing open my car door and vomiting up coffee, bile and my non-existent  breakfast. 

After I met up with the dgirl, I stuck a glob in foil and started smoking. As soon as I inhaled the first hit, I retched so hard and fast that I choked on the smoke coming back up, and spent a moment slumped forwards in agony. Once I collected myself and managed to get a few hits down, I was well enough to get myself home and do things up proper, but for a bit there, I felt really, really awful.

I am 100% sure that it wasn't just withdrawal symptoms, because whenever I detox, I never, ever vomit, except the time I had precipitated withdrawals. Also, when this happened, I was barely starting to be sick, the only symptoms I had were goosebumps, sneezing, a very slight chill and the feeling of impending doom. 

This had has happened to me a few more times as well, just not as bad. The other times, the retching happened as I was taking my first hit, so I thought it may be the taste/smell, even though normally I enjoy the smell because I know good times are about to happen. The taste also doesn't normally bother me, even if it tastes bad, it has never caused me to throw up.

What I think happened was that I had some sort of psychosomatic reaction, and my body produced physical symptoms? The thing that triggered it (ugh, the t-word makes me cringe now, even when used correctly) was the dgirl saying ""Yes, let's meet now."" Has anyone else ever had this happen to them? Thoughts? Ideas? Input?

Tl;dr: waited much longer than usual between dosing, and the mere mention of getting dope made me violently sick.

So he just asked me to front him 2 points until tomorrow. But part of me wants to be like, ""remember when I asked you to front me, you fucking cocksucker? That's right, bitch. Choke on a fat, warty dick, ya trick bitch.""


So what do ya'll think? Front him 0.2 and keep the cash flowing, or tell him to eat shit and die until he's got cash in hand like his bitch ass did to me?",1496362027.0

I've been hiding my habit from my wife for about 7 months now.. i quit last halloween for about a week and my wife helped me through the withdrawals and everything but it wasn't a week before i was using again..  I've tried to quit several times since to no avail.

anyways, to the point, i found some roxy 30s in my area this week and it was the first time in awhile that ive found them, and first time ever ive found this many.. 20 in total (had to pay $30 a pop but oh well).  So i just got home from work and went to the back bathroom to break one down and snort it.  i had the bedroom door closed bc we have a one year old son who is not allowed in our bedroom so at least i had that going for me.  Well as soon as i get it busted down i hear the door open and in comes my wife.  i put the card i was using over the powder and immediately greet her at the bathroom door.  ""What are you doing?"" she asks.  ""Oh nothing.. just back here trying to take a shit but i cant squeeze it out, what are you doing?"".  She said she came back there to check on the laundry, which she does (you can go through the back bathroom to get to the garage where our laundry machines are.  so i wait there in front of my drugs knowing shes going to come back through and I can't let her see them.  I sit on the sink they are on and grab her and give her a little kiss as she passes by..  ""you alright?"" she asks.  i say i'm fine and she goes back and sits on the couch in the living room. 

i'm almost numb from the whole experience.. definitely ruined my high a bit.  the thing that bothers me is i think she knows but she won't call me out.  like, she didn't even have to go through the back bathroom in the first place.  There is a door to our garage 10 feet away from the couch she was sitting on so there was a reason she came back there.  and then i acted super fucking weird while she was back there and she doesn't say anything?   wtf.  im a shitty fuckin person and i need to stop.  i need to tell her.  i cant do it until im actually working to be a better person.  im going to try to quit again after today bc i wont have anymore roxies tomorrow and going back to lortabs and percocets  just wont be the same.  i have plenty of kratom and lope that im going to use and i just need to sack up and do this shit.

Not really sick anymore. But with PAWS and the usual crippling depression and anxiety, But amplified times 10 because I haven't been running to the dope boy at the first sign of adversity. The junk life has taken such a toll on me physically and maybe even more mentally. Always scrambling to stay well and hardly getting high because I share literally every speck of dope I buy with two others. One doesn't contribute what so ever he just chills at home and reaps the reward, But he's the first to bitch if someone does even a line without him. And the other contributes when they can but not the way I do, I have no problem sharing with this person though. Even when I'm high the depression and anxiety still lingers in the back of my head, It's just a lot less noticeable. It's pretty bearable when I'm high let's say that. I've dealt with this since I was 13 years old, I'll be 22 next month. 


I'll just get to the point. On one hand, Being a junkie is hard honestly. I have no job no car no diploma and very few ways to make cash. And when I do I can't even enjoy it because I know the impending doom that is withdrawal draws closer with every line WE take. That's another thing, WE. If I were to just leave and go stay in the woods or something and not have to share, I could be high for most of the week. Sometimes longer. What I'm getting at is there aren't very many pros of continuing the junkie life.


But on the other hand. When I'm sober, Depressed would be an understatement. I honestly wanna kill myself from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep. Literally I'd rather die. Nothing feels okay, Nothing makes me happy. I don't enjoy doing anything. I used to love video games and basketball and hanging out with friends, But when I'm sober I have to force myself just to get out of bed. I don't want to do anything. I might go out one night of the month and put on a smile for my friends and family, Just so they don't worry. Life for me has just lost all its appeal. I don't know what to do or how to fix it, Or if it can even be fixed. I'm stuck, There is no middle ground. One step forward then ten steps back, Forever a deficit.

Tldr below. 

As I have mentioned in another thread, I went and did an ibogaine treatment 1,5 weeks ago. I only did one flood dose (2 were recommended) and didn't have the enlightening experience that canceled out my desire to get high or even get another perspective to work on/with my depression. Plus, I didn't clear out my shooting kit before leaving for treatment, which says a lot in itself. Marvelously stupid. When I got back, I was still very depressed and newly disappointed that I still felt as empty & suicidal as ever before. In addition I felt (and more so now)  very ungrateful for not cherishing the sobriety I was given. I thought I could play around a little with cooking out filters and a hit here and there- just until I get back to work. It was only 6 days between my arrival and the first day of work. Work always keeps my thoughts in check. Today was my first day at work and I've been back in the game. Have been shooting up during breaktime, just like 2years ago. 

I'd really just like to lie down and die. How can I ever own up to failing again and tell my mother that she paid thousands in vain? How can I look anyone in the eye and admit that I still haven't made it? I know that they know objectively that addiction isn't easy to come by. But I can feel how my clean acquaintances (&roommates) think I'm stupid for always getting back to the needle. For never making it through to recovery. I know they're fed up with having to live with a junkie. It's a downer having me around. 
But if I move out I'd be even lonelier. There'd be less keeping me from suicide. 

On the first night home, after the ibogaine treatment I cooked up filters. On day2 I went and scored a bag and used for 2 days straight. On the 4th morning I woke up in mild withdrawal and got scared. I dragged myself through the city and scored benzos to smooth out the wd's. Though kind of knocked out, I still spent the day/night with restless legs, diarrhea and hot/cold sweats. So I went out and copped 3.6 grams of dope the next day, which was yesterday, I believe. In the first place because I promised someone a birthday cake&appearing at the party but was too embarrassed to admit being in withdrawal bc I relapsed. I haven't taken it all, yet. but I don't know if I should try to withdraw again over the weekend or if I should go back on maintenance, just as I was before the ibogaine treatment. 


The upside of maintenance was the stability it gave me. But I don't know if it'll be easy to go back to that or if I will struggle to not use heroin on top. Simply the loss of face, the humiliation of having to go back to that doctors office and being dependent on that asshole doc for every move I make, having to go there every day, makes me want to off myself even more! 
The question is whether it is realistically possible for me to withdraw over the weekend or if I'll just suffer pointlessly only to relapse again and end up on maintenance anyway. I'm only entertaining the idea of a short withdrawal period because the ibogaine might have reset my opiate tolerance. At least that's what multiple sources say about the effect of ibogaine on opi tolerance. And I notice that I need way less than before. 


I've got ibogaine root bark for approximately 10 days of micro dosing, Lyrica, diazepam, clonazepam, promethazin, lots of dope I'd rather (not) shoot and hashish. Tomorrow I have to work, which means that I have to use if I wake up with wd's. That's not really an if... 

I don't know what to do. I'm panicking and that never ends well. If anyone has read til here, I'm much obliged and if some Internet stranger has advice to offer, I'm listening. I know I need to want to be clean, but I do want to be! I just can't handle the emptiness and the suicidal thoughts. 

Tl;dr: I relapsed after ibogaine and don't know if I should go back on maintenance or try to quit cold turkey this weekend. What do you think? Can I make it? If so, how? 

Ps: will follow up with dopepr0n. At least I'll contribute to the much praised 'realness' of this sub lol.

Dr knew it wasnt drug related...( who injects under their thumb nail, right? ) anyway, they were very kind and gentle, but it still hurt like a muthaFukka!!!....and they only gave me 5 viciden 5mg!!!! I told them im on suboxone, hoping theyd understand tolerance and all that, however , I think the doc gave me even less after hearing that.
SO is this tip floating through my body as we speak?? I thought itd just stay there like a splinter and eventually Id grab it when it pushes out a bit..... IM am so so freraked out now!!!!!! I guess I have to head to ER again tomm AM.....Should I do a hit before I go, bc I know they aint gonna give an old junky like me nothing for the pain? or would you go sober and pray the knock u out with something if they need to open me?? Im really looking for some opinions and anticdotes here guys... please help me out, Share your tales please......FUCK FUCK FUCK",1496333102.0

So I use DNM exclusively, and though I usually make my money legitimately, I was desperate last November and needed a fix badly. A well known vendor contacted me asking if I'd be interested in being one of his reshippers (I had dealt with him before and he trusted me at this point), offering me 100x 80mg mundipharma OC80s. Well of course I'd be an idiot not to accept, as he also offered over $8,000 a month, so I gave him my address and he shipped me the oxy from Europe (I'm in the US).

 A week later I got the OCs, all 100 of them in blister packs of 10 (I still have the blisters as a souvenir). Well of course I wasn't there i wasnt going to reship them, so over the next month, until Christmas Eve, I used about 2-3 OCs a day in addition to a few grams of fent-dope. On Christmas Eve my family found the oxys, about 30 of them left, and I was busted. I felt like a complete shithead, especially since it was Christmas Eve and my family is super religious. 

They hid the pills, and the next time I was alone I searched the house and found them hidden in the garage. I really wanted to resist but I couldn't, so like the junkie I am I kept on taking them out of the hiding spot one at a time, thinking no one would notice. At this point I had come up with a crazy story about the pills being a friends and that I didn't know they were under my bed (I'm 100% sure my family didn't buy it), and when I finally got caught taking one of the pills out, I denied it still and said I was just taking them out to flush them. What kind of an asshole am I to lie to their faces after I've been explicitly caught. I'm still not clean and my family has dropped the issue and still thinks I'm using it can't prove it. 

Anyway, it gets better. The vendor knows I scammed him and has been sending me messages on the DNM and letters to my house telling me he's going to CALL THE COPS. I call his bluff so he starts sending me packages containing an unknown white powder which I obviously never touched. I think he's forgotten about me by now but for a while I was scared shitless about some thug knocking down my door and killing me on the spot. Well maybe it's not that crazy of a story but whatever I thought I'd share anyway.",1496500022.0

I know I'll get some hate for this but before I started fuckjn wit blues heavy I used to be a HEAVY lean sipper.. I'm talkin a pint every 3 days type shit.. 4-6 oz a day was normal... Along with a shit load of medical marijuana an maybe 15-30mg oxycodone when I was sippin I barely ever did blues... (LOL now my tolerance is 150-240mg oxycodone a day) But eventually when Actavis went off market it went downhill wit prices steady rising.. Ended up costing me around 5-6k a month right before I quit sippin an started only poppin blues..! So eventually I started usin more blues (i was selling ALOT at the time, pill mill days shit) So it reminds me of crackin the seals on pints of Actavis prometh/codeine (before discontinuation), qualitest, mgp/wockhardt, caraco, hitech... ALL that good shit I fucked wit it all I wasn't a purple only bandwagoner... Lol  my favorite was the yellow tussionex, the red hydromet wasn't shit compared to that yella SNOT!

I haven't slept since quite possibly Sunday? I've lost all track of time on this stuff, and just recall getting samples randomly from all my regular guys on Memorial Day, because I recall thinking is this coming back and that's why the are both suddenly adding it to the menu when I recall them both saying something along the line of 'not worth its weight to have nobody fucks with it' Who the hell knows? Maybe it was buy a dope rock, get a big glowing shard for free. And they just so happen to shop at the same All Things Drugs. Obviously the only explanation on why they both started pushing it that wonderful day. I'm sure they figured out I been cheating behind their backs with each other to maximize my drug intake entirely, that plot has holes that I need to ponder to make it plausible. 

I just spent the last two hours jotting down key notes of a really confusing fight with my dope boy last night, I've concluded he is trying to ax me out of the game because I unintentionally entered into a possible turf war with him. Fucking badass was my first thought, like shit when I get the balls to do that stuff. Then I realized I am dumb, he is my connect for my goods I help find new homes and upon testing several theories and equations I make $10 more than him per one pill. I let this slip, it's only reasonable he would then conclude he needs to kill the competition. Which makes perfect sense that nobody will question the little wanna be dealer junkie chick with a small hustle that meth has convinced her she is wearing a target. I mean, that all makes sense, however the worlds worst cocaine that I better not fucking touch anymore of, and I better not fucking leave my house either bullshit and then the hidden gun that I have yet to find in my house. 

I need more meth to figure this all out, I'm pretty sure I'm on borrowed time at this point. However, I am going to live it up while I can. He is trying to distract me with free goodies and possible sex. WAIT NO, WELL PLAYED THAT'S HOW HE.WILL DO IT. How can anybody resist free drugs? Fucking brilliant man. 

A little bit ago, at least it feels that long ago I did a fat rail of boy. Like, primo usually nodding shit. Since I've been going this long on the party bus of one, shouldn't dope bring me down at least slightly? Because truthfully it kind makes me feel a little more paranoid. 

Basically, before this rollercoaster ride I have only done a small bump of meth before, however a smaller than usual dose of boy brought me to an even level.

I ran triathlons the past two summers. The first season, I started to get shin splints and bought Vicodin and Percs illegally so that I could run through the pain on long runs.

Sooner or later, my pill habit grows from twice a week to a daily habit. I've often been physically dependent on different drugs at different stages of my life, but have only ever been full-on addicted to marijuana, so I only maintained on about 30-40mg a day on my worst days.

However, the pills got too expensive and, you know how the story goes, I switched to H. Whereas the pills made me feel energized, confident, and motivated, the brown sugar slowly took over my life. I never lost my job or stole or cheated to get high, but I was still spending a good $40/day to huff the junk up my nose.

Last Sunday, I had a bad car accident and realized that I hadn't been myself since I'd been on the junk. It made me docile, sexless, irritable, reticent, and withdrawn. Even if I could continue to function that way for another two years, I didn't want to be a spectator watching myself live from a distance. I wanted to take an active role in my life again. To care.

So I quit cold-turkey. The first three days were agony, but I can't imagine it was as bad as a hardcore IV user's withdrawals, so I tried to get up and go outside once in a while to enjoy the sun. Still, it was hard to see the bright side of anything. 

My house looked like a warzone because I hadn't cleaned it for months on account of being on the junk. There were bills piling up. Responsibilities I was neglecting. I could barely even get out of bed to work remotely.

By day five, the worst of the physical symptoms was past but I still felt the same PAWS-type symptoms of depression, anxiety, irritability, and general malaise. 

Then I remembered that I had four 100mcg tabs of LSD in my cupboard I'd been saving for a special occasion. I'd read the accounts of people with general depression and anxiety using doses of 10-20mcg and experiencing incredible benefits, but had always been sceptical. Still, my curiosity got the best of me. I cut a small sliver off of a single tab and swallowed it.

Within 20 minutes, my entire outlook had changed:
-  My anxiety (for which I'd been using .5mg klonopin once/day through day four) melted away instantly. 
- My depression lifted. I started laughing again. Engaging with the world around me. Calling friends I hadn't spoken to in months because of the junk. 

- I was more empathetic - I focused less on myself (the only one I'd been thinking about the entire time I'd been on opiates) and started to think about other people. I was offering keen insights during these conversations that audibly surprised the friends I'd been phoning. I guess they hadn't been used to my being so engaging in a long time!

- I was energized and invigorated - I got off the couch for the first time in five days and cleaned the entire house, paid all of my bills, shaved and showered, and learned two songs by Vance Joy on the guitar before my girlfriend got home from work. 

I plan to continue a microdosing regiment of 1/7 tab (approximately 15mcg) every three days. I'm well aware that one day is hardly indicative of a miracle cure, but I see no reason why the next month of this regimen should produce anything but positive results.

Let me know your thoughts!

6ex2zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6ex2zx/my_jail_story/,35,https://redd.it/6ex2zx,doobiousdoob,My jail story,"So I wanted to post this but was afraid NYPD would be lurking and didn't want to get my self in more trouble. Now that it's all over and my car is safely in my possession I can tell my story....

So last Saturday I woke up with the countdown to being sick wel on the way to 0. So I throw some jeans over my bball shorts and head out to meet my dude. That was the easiest part of the day. I get my shit sniff my 2 bags and carry on with my day...I'm about to get on the BQE and head home when all of a sudden a cop comes up behind me...FUCK! My girl thinks I'm still close by the home when in fact I'm a boro over...thats gonna go over well. So the cop pulls me over for a seatbelt(FKN idiot I am not having it on) he comes to my window asks for all my info you know the usual license reg insurance. I throw my dope on the side of my seat and slide some papers in then crevice to hide it. I wanted to cheek it but didn't have the time and still had basketball shorts on. At the time I figured I'd get a ticket and carry on w/ my day...nah homeboy goes your license is suspended step out of the car. ""Wait what officer what's going on?"" 

""STEP OUT OF THE FKN CAR DO WHAT I SAY OR THIS WILL GET WORSE FOR YOU"" Im like oh shit this is gonna blow. I'm cuffed TIGHTLY! FKN dick head. 3 more cops come and I'm assuming I'm done for. The 2 cops take me to the station like hey man this should Only take about 2 hours and you'll be in your way...ya nope. So a cop gets in my car and drives it to the station I can see him looking around my car at red lights and I'm hoping and praying he doesn't see down the side of the seat. Luckily he doesn't but I'm not out of the woods yet.


I had a bundle of empties that just happened to be in my pocket that I also hid in the seat it self I wasn't worried about those they couldn't get to them unless they literally tore open the drivers seat. I was feelin confident that all my bags were in hiding...we get to the station and they start searching me find nothing thank god. Than asshole deuchebag who put the cuffs on really tight searches me again and find 1 baggy and empty but fuck me. No one says anything about it at the time. They start to search my wallet and pull out nothing! Thank god. So I'm put in holding st 11:49am all by myself. About an hour later I'm told that I will in fact not be going home in an hour and because my license is out of state they will need to process me and send me to booking so I don't bail on the judge...I beg and plead to let me prove to them I live in NYC. I can show you a lease a utility bill my student loans my student ID. ANYTHING! Nope no luck I'm going to jail. Fuck. 


About 2 hours later a cop comes in freaking out saying ""I'm not your arresting officer so idc what charges you have blah blah blah but I found 4 glassine baggies in your wallet...shit you did? Weird. She goes I opened it and powder shot out on to my uniform and I'm afraid I inhaled some of it. She goes be honest what is it please tell me idk if I need to go to the hospital. I said the baggies if they were in there are empty so whatever amount happened to spill out is harmless. She presses me asking what is it I can't feel safe with u just saying it's harmless. I play dumb. Officer whatever it is won't hurt you. I eventually just say it's dope plain old dope...she asks if it's snorting dope or shooting dope...I said their is no difference all opiates dissolve in water. She starts freaking out thinking she was gonna OD. I try to calm her down like ""officer calm down please you will be fine "" it couldn't have been much because well I would have done it if there was a lot in there. I tell her she will be fine and not to stress...she doesn't believe me and call FDNY. I'm assuming they tell her she'll be fine cause they were talking to her for 30 sec and then left. I couldn't hear them but I could see them. 


So around 6pm I ask why haven't I been taken to bookin yet it's been over 6 hours. I was then informed they are adding a possession of a controlled substance charge for the 4 empty baggies. I said they were empty how is that possession...residue. So at this point they're telling me they need to go through my car and take EVERYTHING OUT. Shit there gonna find the other 3 bags of actual full dope and another 2 empties but I never hear nanytning bout it so i was praying that for just a tiny inkling of luck.

They present me my new charges and I'm cuffed and processed taken to BK central booking...a god awful terrible place that smells like piss and shit and for some weird reason the walls are sticky. To make a long story short I started to get sick and was praying I would see a judge that night. I didn't. Ok looks like it's time to spend a night in jail only white guy here and no where to sit no food to eat no water to drink and no blankets around 1am I'm starting to feel really sick. I use a roll of tp and my sneakers to make a ""pillow"" and a tshirt I found on the ground ripped into a blanket. I slept about 5 minutes all night it was god awful and ppl were starting to figure out why I was so jittery and cold and sweaty. For the most part tho ppl were cool. Another white dude came in around 1am and he really calmed me down and looked out for me. I owe him. The next morning could not come fast enough. But ofcourse I'm not on the first call for ppl to eee the judge. FUCK I got to go back in that shit cell. I try to sleep till they call my name. I don't. Can't eat not that they offered food anyways. Then around 10:15 I get the call THANK GOD. See my lawyer and get in front of the judge by 12;15. Lawyer got all charges dropped. All I can think of is I hope those 3 bags are still in my car.i use my last 20$ to get to the precinct. I ask to go in my car they say no I beg and plead as much as I can without being suspicious. My girl is there and says just go look thru the window.i say fine. I look and omg the doors aren't locked!!!! I go in and look on the side of my seat OMFG THE DOPE IS THERE GRAB IT GRAB IT! I get my hands on the dope and I hear STEP AWAY FROM YHE FUCKING VEHICLE WHAT IS WEONG WITH YOU DO U WANT TO GO BACK TO JAIL. I shove that shit under my sack so quickly hoping she doesn't notice what I just did. She checks the car out and asks why I needed to get in there so badly. I tell her I just wanted to make sure you guys didn't trash my girls car. My gf apologizes for my behavior and says ""I'm sorry he's not used to this he's never been arrested before"" I apologize for my behavior and all is well. I get my wallet my cellphone and shit and boogie to a bathroom to get well...  I breathe a sigh of relief until I remembered the bun of empties but whatever that's up to god now hope my behavior doesn't lead them to search the car more. It didn't thank god cause I couldn't go back I woulda just killed my self. My girl knew something was up and was pretty pissed but I told her I was buying subs and had hid a few when they pulled me over. To wrap this up. I got the car back on Tuesday and dealt with MUCH cooler cops than on Saturday. Grabbed the bun of empties scraped them and tossed them.

All and all 0/10 wouldn't recommend. Learned the system tho and next time I will cheek my dope so I have some in booking if there Ever is a next time. Hopefully there won't be u never kno in this game. 

TLDR: got arrested hid dope in the car they didn't find it. Snuck into my own car while it was in police custody cause I was so sick. After 27 hours in jail. Almost got caught and send back to jail but JJ was there for me. 

I feel for all you doing time and I don't wish it on any of you we aren't hurting any one just ourselves and that's ok in my mind. Just not theirs. Stay strong everyone in lockup

One of the biggest ones is that i have now taken out about 6 or 7 high interest payday loans from various websites. I have made a couple payments on a couple of them but the rest I havent made a single payment on. The money is supposed to be automatically taken out of my checking account but i found that if i hop online and transfer the money to my savings account as soon as the money goes in my account they wont be able to take thier payment.  So my question is, other than ruining my credit that i recently finally got back up to a decent score after working on it for a couple years, can i get into any trouble with the law or will the unpaid ones just end up getting sent to a collection agency? I know that they can then take me to court to get thier money but my plan is to wait for them to go to collection and just make a payment plan with the collection agency. I just wanna make sure i cant get into any real trou le for doing what im doing. I know, im being a bonehead, but i really dont care lol im an addict.

I (obviously) decided it'd be easier for me to go back on maintenance next week which is why I'm spending the weekend drowning my disappointment in speedballs. I will try the ibogaine again next year after finishing my bachelors degree and then I'll take the recommended 2 flood doses. My failing so gloriously this time is mostly because I expected too much, I think. Even with iboga, only one week off, only one flood dose, being on too high a dose of opiates beforehand and without any kind of therapy or after care is not a promising setup for kicking a 5yr opiate habit and lifelong depression. 



What we've actually got here is heroin in the green bubbles and benzos in blisters.
I actually scored coke after I took that pic but that would be just one more obscure bubble, which is why I didn't take another pic... Plus I was busy getting them speedballs into my bloodstream. 


 

Hope y'all are nodding safely out there.

(but if you want to quit and have the opportunity  to use iboga as a way to support or jumpstart your recovery, do so! The least it does is making the withdrawal bearable.) ",1496570297.0

Let me preface this, it's been probably 8 years since I've had DMT, and back then I didn't know how to properly use a meth pipe... Now I do, very well.

I also only get spun out maybe once every 3-6 months.. cause I hate it once you pass the 48 hour mark. So I have no tolerance.. a 1/4 of shake could keep me up 3 days easy.

So I was gifted some DMT recently, took maybe half a hit last night to feel it out.. then today, a friend stop to get a tattoo from my roommate​, and brings some methylated amphetamines for us... So I get spun out, and decide to break through with the DMT.. so I put on shpongle and light her up...

And god damn I forgot how amazing DMT is... It actually physically hurt pretty bad when I started tripping, and so much was going on, then I dissolved and shit went amazing.

I'm not sure if the stims made it stronger, but I imagine it would.

**The Dead Flag Blues**

*“The car is on fire, and there’s no driver at the wheel.”*

The fires had finally burned out.

Looking down on the peninsula from San Bruno Mountain, the scene looked like the pictures Adam had seen of the city after the 1908 earthquake. As then, the city burnt. But this time, there was nearly nothing left to rebuild from. Between the bay and the mount he stood upon, there stood no wall; no structure.

One single tear rolled down Adam’s face before he wiped it away and admonished himself for losing hydration. The last couple weeks (Or was it three? He couldn’t be sure) had changed him. Not just his outward personality; no, it changed the way he looked at and lived in this world. Every meal was a blessing, and every drop of water was sacred.

The amount of weight he lost was shocking. Food was hard to come by, as any and all stores of any kind had been looted right at the beginning. Bottles of water were rare, and any other source was contaminated. He would kill and eat just about any animal he saw, and even that was rare and somewhat dangerous. Not to mention, any fruit-bearing trees or bushes had long since been picked clean. He was, quite literally, starving to death.

He used to have hope. Hope that things would get better, hope that help would come. Hope that his family was alive.

Hope that he would survive.

However, just like seemingly everything (and nearly everyone) else, his hope had died as well. After the blast, most of the survivors from San Francisco had tried to evacuate to, well, anywhere. Word quickly came, mostly through car radios protected from the EMP by many cars' natural ""faraday cage"" effect, that more cities on the west coast had been hit: Oakland, Seattle, Olympia, Portland, L.A., San Diego, Sacramento, and many smaller towns housing military bases. Many key locations were also destroyed on systems that supplied water, crippling water flow to many major cities. Word of mouth reports whispered of foreign soldiers flying red flags landing in the south, though of what nation was never agreed upon. Some feared China, some claimed North Korea, somewhat hopefully. Further bolstering these claims was the complete lack of federal aid; it seemed all resources had been routed to southern California, and from what most people could tell, said resources were military in nature.

All of this was in the back of most people’s minds, however; at least here in the Bay Area. Death demanded the focus of most. There were newly blind people, and people with their skin seemingly melting off. People with terrible, malicious sunburn-like wounds honestly got off lucky, depending on severity. Adam had been riding his bike around Forest Hill, and the shockwave had knocked him off his bike and given him these sunburns; he considered himself fortunate, especially since the hills and thick trees has protected him somewhat.

Or at least, he and others who survived the initial blast thought they were fortunate. That is, until the sickness began to set in. For some, it happened quickly; after early bouts of nausea, diarrhea, severe headaches, and fever. This was followed by hair loss, horrifying rashes, and blood loss from seemingly random places. The first death was around two weeks after the explosion, with more following.

In Adam’s eyes, he was doomed to die. He may not have any physical injuries, but he was caught by fallout. He felt all of the early symptoms. It was even hard to think sometimes, and his hand-eye coordination seemed off. There were others who were worse, yes, but that did not mean he was to survive.

That’s why he climbed to the top of this mountain: to die. He may not have told himself that, but somewhere inside, he knew it was why. Consciously, he told himself it was to see the city for himself; maybe it wasn’t as bad as they said. Maybe, down there where once stood a mighty, beautiful city, maybe there was a glimmer of hope. He didn’t even know what that might be: an encampment of survivors, or maybe FEMA or the National Guard.

Yet all he saw was his whole life destroyed. It was all just rubble around a crater. A crater right about where city hall once stood. AT&T Park, where he spent many a day watching baseball: gone. Flattened were the streets of Chinatown, where you could find all sorts of cheap knick-knacks. 

Adam's house was gone, too. He had checked: after the blast, and after he was able to collect himself, he made a beeline back to his house. He had been riding to train for a race while his wife had stayed home with his three year old son and his twelve year old daughter, who was having a sleepover. He had ridden through his rubble-strewn neighborhood around an hour after the bombs hit, avoiding both broken, flaming gas lines, and the truth of what all the destruction around him meant. Where his house used to stand stood only a scorched concrete foundation. And yet he convinced himself that they had somehow escaped; he had heard of there being old Cold War bunkers around still, maybe they made it there, or had somehow managed to get far enough away from ground zero to survive.

But from up here, he could see just how far past his familial home the complete devastation went. It had been too long, and his mental blinders were finally removed: his family was dead. And in this instant, this moment where his whole destroyed life was laid before him, he decided to die. And to do so on his own terms, not by the terms of radiation sickness.

And so, he sat down, took off his backpack, and pulled out a small vial and a syringe. He had participated in the looting shortly after the bomb went off, and he had snagged this, among other things: a bottle of Numorphan, otherwise known as Oxymorphone. He had originally thought of trying to sell it, as he was never one for narcotics. However, money meant nothing now, and nobody was willing to part with food or water for drugs. At least, nobody he met who had food and water was.

Now, however, he had a use for it. He calmly filled the syringe with what he thought was a lethal dose and, using one of his shoelaces, tied off his arm. He had never done this, so he was going off of doctor’s visits and movie depictions. After slapping his arm a couple times (he wasn't even sure why), he found a vein, and tried to insert the needle into said vein. He found it akin to stabbing a cooked spaghetti noodle with a sewing needle; he laughed to himself at the thought, despite the pain.

Finally, after nearly a half hour of trying and him nearly giving up, he hit the vein, pulled a small plume of blood into the syringe, and pushed the plunger. A second of bliss, and then: darkness.

I was very interested to try them. When I finally got a hold off him, he was sadly out for the moment and tried to push ""the american lean which all the rappers in USA were using"" for a ridiculous price.
I had no interest in it because i got shitloads of promethazine and codeine just waiting to be cwed, so i politely declined and he told me he would get more oxys soon.

Anyways, I had asked him multiple times about the manufacturer of the pill or any specifics about the pills and he always just replied ""oxys"", sketchy as fuck right?. 

Took 4 days for him to re-up on this ""popular"" product of his. He was in my hometown when I called him this morning, but he couldn't stop for five minutes, so he made me drive after him for 40 minutes. And when i got to the designated meetup, I waited 10 extra minutes before he finally arrived, tweaked out of his mind.

He showed me the busted blister pack of ""30mg oxys"", which were 20mg Oxycodone/10mg Naloxone.... He seemed like he had no idea what he was selling and he had never heard of naloxone before. The guy didn't even read the back of the blister pack ffs, i skipped my awesome breakfast I made and drove like crazy for this shit. I was not happy to say the least, I explained what he was selling and I had no interest in buying this product, he apologized multiple times and told me that he was given ""30mg oxys"" to sell. But oh well, shit happens and this deal could have gone much worse.
My usual connect hooked me up with some juicy oc 40's half an hour later so the trip was not wasted.

I took about  2mg suboxone this morning at 7am. At around 3pm I found a bun and snorted it all. I actually felt it and got high. Now I am worrying about the eventual W/Ds. I do not want to wake up in the middle of the night with restless legs bc I slept at my girl's last night and woke up at 7 with the worst restless legs ever (hence, the suboxone at 7am).

I honestly want to take another piece of sub because I still feel a little edgy and like I am going to get restless legs soon. By my normal withdrawal counter, I would be getting sick about ~17 hours later, so around 9 am I would start to feel it and probably get the restless legs. 

Can I take more sub tonight? Or did doing the dope mess something up? Would I get precipitated w/ds if I dosed more sub tonight, even though I used while I had sub in my system? I honestly do not want to use anymore and I'm mad at myself for doing that dope. I wanted to stay on subs for a few days and taper off. I want to take more sub ASAP to stop myself from using tomorrow.

I know it's a bit weird of a question, but I figured someone here would know. Thanks.",1496538888.0

I'm not proud of myself I struggle with addiction to the very medicine I'm prescribed every month. I usually run low on week 3 I get 60 that's 2 a day. Oddly I am a runner and I lift. I started having anxiety attacks that led into seizures a couple of years ago. I'd wake up disoriented really angry because I'd be surrounded by EMT's trying to do their job but I didn't have any recollection of a seizure and I'd accuse my partner of trying to get me sent away to some mental health facility. I began building a tolerance to this medicine and I'd try breaking my doses into halves and taking 4 small doses. I was originally given Clonipin 2mg and I still had the fainting the fear of door handles or touching money crouds and seizing. So the MD gave me those bastard xanax after no results yielded. I'm guessing my relentless running and lifting and gallon of water a day was flushing out the meds. Anyway, now at the months end I find myself searching for something to get me through till my next refill. I have reliable people but those come and go according to their lifestyles. So recently I have found myself using new connections that are old friends. I'm really not sure if they realize they have dupes or not but I can tell immediately; sadly. I can tell by the sound of them dropping into a hand the ""clink"" I can tell by popping one the ""snap back"" lastly the taste the cut is chalky. Real xanax tastes disgusting but dupes just chalky w a retro undertone of meds like wine tasting. I'm not proud to know these signs, but the color shape everything has improved so the naked eye isn't always enough although I can always spot imperfections in the beveling around the edges or any discoloration so the white contoured ones have become popular. Like with any craft the more you practice the better you get so they're now producing busses, hulks, yellow footballs as well and w very little or no visual flaws. I prefer the Pepsi challenge. If I can't chew one after popping it in half I walk away. I can tell by the clinking of them usually. Again I'm ashamed of this. The dupe xanax is an epidemic where In my county. Idk about other pills I don't use any others but I have to assume they exist and are just as much of a problem as the xanax dupes. I hate wondering what they cut them with, it tastes like chalk I've had no adverse side effects and I have chewed enough that I should have had some if there were any. That could change when more people such as myself insist on tasting and snapping one before pulling out a single buck. I can say most of the people I deal with know me well and when I tell them they have a bag of crayola chalk that's worthless their faces are mostly utter disappointment and anger. Some, I will think know and just get mad they couldn't screw me over. One person called me and said they had some I said how many, they answered: limitless. I hung up after telling them good luck selling your limitless supply of bullshit, they showed up mad at me even after I wasn't interested and never called them to begin with. They insisted on arguing I let my dogs off their leashes and they haven't been back since. I have a very good job one of the reasons I can't show up sick from not having my medicine and shaking. The same reason I'm targeted to sell these awful plague of evil twin benzodiazepines to. I lost my fair share of money in the beginning of the dupe era. Since I've been lucky plus it's well known I know my shit. I'm fortunate enough to be going into treatment soon but to those who can't or aren't it's buyer beware out here. No class race or religion is above addiction likewise there are no biases when a dealer wants a dollar. And no honor among thieves. If it sounds to good to be true it is. Go with instinct also don't let the need for relief be the reason you wasted your money. Real ones will come along. When I got ripped off, I knew I was but I was sick and wanted so badly to be wrong. I just ended up losing money being disappointed and had to fight a moral battle with myself not to pay it forward. Save yourself the trouble. A few days uncomfortable stinks. If you can't afford to gamble with your money don't. As for IV users buying opiate dupes. I have no advice I only fear the results of putting anything in my arm known or unknown. It could be way worse than chewing up a dupe bar but what do I know? I'm just sharing my experience. ",1496520684.0

6f20lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6f20lb/ok_so_vivitrol/,11,https://redd.it/6f20lb,-OrangeAristocat-,"ok so, Vivitrol","I've been on the monthly injection vivitrol shot for 6 months now, and it was a last resort. I was offered it in rehab 3 months prior to when i started it, and i turned it down bc even though i had never researched it or even heard about it, i knew something fucky was up. I knew what naltrexone was, basically like naloxone on steroids in terms of half-life and binding affinity, and even though the doctors at the rehab insisted otherwise, it sounded scary having your endorphins completely blocked for a month. I'm already a depressed fucking drug addict, i need all the natural feel good chemicals i can get. Endogenous opiates actually play some important roles in your body. Also, why the fuck were alcoholics lining up to get this injection? Would you ever think to give Narcan to someone who was drunk to stop them from being drunk? Then why the hell would naltrexone work? It doesn't. In my own experience, vivitrol has had no effect on alcohol intoxication. I never liked drinking anyway so it doesn't even matter, but i still think it was messed up for the rehab to push vivitrol as a cure for alcohol cravings.

Anyway, my point of this post is that i see wrong information being passed around about vivitrol. Starting with the cravings subject (and how do you define the word cravings anyway), empirically and logically speaking naltrexone has no effect on opiate cravings either. Unlike buprenorphine/suboxone, vivitrol does not activate opiate receptors in anyway, all it does is bind tightly to them and block most opiates from getting through. It definitely has a psychological factor, bc you know that it would be pointless to buy heroin after a really shitty day because it'd be a waste of money. 

Ok now the dangerous part of my post. I am not trying to influence anyone to try this, I don't subscribe to the misery loves company philosophy and I don't wanna see anyone be unsuccessful at getting clean. But I did research in the beginning when I first got the injection and based on the binding affinities of all the opiates, the safest and one of the strongest one was buprenorphine. The binding affinity values of naltrexone and buprenorphine are pretty close, but bupe is not as dangerous as the alternative which is fentanyl and its analogues. Using fentanyl recreationally is obviously not a good idea, people are dying left and right nowadays because of tiny miscalculations of fentanyl dosages. So, like the opiate addict I am, I decided to buy an 8mg suboxone strip and, like the needle addict I am, injected roughly 2mg to start and waited, then went up in 2mg increments until i had done the whole strip. High. I know everyone will tell me not to inject suboxone films or pills without a micron filter, so if you don't already know, don't shoot things intended for anything other than IV use. I do this a few times a month, the high greatly varies, sometimes i get a background buzz and sometimes I am fully nodding out and I'm in overdose territory. Bupe is a unique drug and doesn't provide a lot of euphoria bc it isn't a pure Mu-1 agonist like traditional opiates, so there is a lesser risk of respiratory depression IF USED ALONE, never mix it with benzos or alcohol.

I just want to emphasize that i don't want anyone to go out and try injecting suboxone. Just the act of injecting the film alone is dangerous for your health if used long term, and the terms ""overdose"" and ""vivitrol"" should start going hand-in-hand. Don't hurt yourself, and if you're going to do it anyway, make sure a friend is with you that can call 911 in case of an overdose. Im not even sure if an average dose of narcan would reverse a bupe overdose, you would need to go to a hospital.

I've gotten the vivitrol shot a day after I had a day or two suboxone binge and I was fine. Ironically, Ive experienced precipitated withdrawal from suboxone several times in the past bc i misjudged my level of heroin withdrawal and yes, it was pure icy hell running through my veins for about an hour. Don't risk it. But based on my experience, PWD happens when you are physically addicted to an opiate. I've done suboxone just a couple hours after using heroin a long time ago in my more naive days and was completely fine bc i wouldn't have gone into normal opiate withdrawal anyway. But theres been times when I've waited 12 hours after my last heroin dose and it wasn't enough time and i was sent to PWD hell. Naltrexone is the same concept. This is just my belief based on experience mind you, Im not a doctor, but the whole waiting 7-10 after the last time you used an opiate before you can safely use naltrexone is just a safe precaution. If you're on an average recreational opiate like heroin or oxycodone with a short half life, and you're physically dependent on it, you would have to wait the same amount of time you would wait to safely take suboxone in order to safely use naltrexone. And if you're not physically dependent, i.e. you used once or twice at the end of the month a day before you're next shot is due, you won't go into PWD.

More and more people are trying the vivitrol injections as a last resort attempt to stay clean and put their family's minds at ease. But it should be made insanely clear that ironically, your chances of overdose are dramatically increased with this medicine. One day you could IV a gram or two of heroin and the naltrexone will completely block it, and the next day you could overdose from half a point because the medicine wore off. Vivitrol is only going to become more and more popular especially after the patent runs out and it becomes generic, and that can be good and bad news. It could work for you if you're willing to work with it, but an unwilling addict should never be forced to take the shot. This has become a pretty long winded post and I'm sorry about that lol but seriously, i see some pretty spotty information about this semi-new medication (vivitrol, not just plain naltrexone) and just like opiate painkillers are well-known to be addictive, the pros and cons of vivitrol should be clearly known by anyone considering trying it.

i said no, but if you don't want to get rid of any bc i wont give him a ride i understand. girl said i sell them to you anyways.

when i get home  i call girl to see if any more pills and dude answers and says blah blah blah fuck you blah blah. next time i see you it aint going to be good blah blah.

So about 5 blocks after I saw the cop, we were going to turn onto the highway and they light us up. Fuck. 

I put the bags in my underwear and my dumbass ""friend"" gives me his bags and a fucking rig for me to hide-- never again. So long story short they bring the dog out and evidently the dog ""hit a few areas"". Anyway, they find a bag under, of course, my seat. After a bit they let us go with a warning, also stating that if they see us around the area again they won't hesitate to stop/ arrest us. Scariest shit ever, considering in the year and a half I've been going over there I've never had a problem. Shit always catches up to you though. 

I'm still pissed that my idiot friend gives me his shit to hide, which will never happen again, but I'm also mad that in the moment I accidentally dropped a bag that got taken, although I'm happy it didn't bring too much trouble. 

Anyways, that was the best that could have came from that situation, so I can't even be mad. I have my freedom. 

Lastly, though, I'm pissed off that I stole $25 from my parents (I know, I know....) and I only got a bag and a half from it. Fucking bullshit. You live and you learn, though. That's my motto. ",1496629010.0

My goal was to use around 10-50 micrograms of naltrexone because they say ultra low dose Naltrexone can enhance, potentiate, or strengthen the opiate effects.

Instead, I actually became sober without any of the withdrawal side effects and especially the terrible effects of instant withdrawal.

Woke up today with only 10% of the withdrawal grogginess and shifty feeling as opposed to all of it.

Truly a wonder drug and I discovered this by complete accident.

I didn't even think 0.1 ml of my diluted naltrexone would have any effect but it did.

This I think is the nail in the coffin cure for getting sober right away even while on drugs without feeling like hell, and afterwards getting on a 3mg per day/night of naltrexone to kick start natural endorphin production because high endorphins and with exercise high testosterone are the key chemicals at least for guys that make daily life easy.

To anyone lurking that isn't in active addiction or hasn't *ever* been addicted to opiates **please don't start**. You never know how much you're going to love this stuff and by then it's too late. 

I miss being able to go to a store and just buy a few mundane items...clothing detergent, antifreeze, magazines to name a few.

I miss not having to hustle every day. I miss not having to mislead the people around me as to why my shoes are so crappy or why I haven't bought new jeans in forever. I miss just living life as a *normal person* and that's what you stand to lose if you venture too far down this road. 
 
It's easy to be fascinated by all the dope porn and awesome pick-ups of fire dope and piles of roxies but it's a roll of the dice if you start up with it.

These bags get you high but it isn't as good of a high. It very subtle and in your head. I just miss getting a real dope high. I can't even get dark net dope and expect it to be real anymore!

first of all I'm apologizing for my poor language, since I'm not a native speaker.

I've been on Trams for around 5 years now, with only a few breaks, the longest one was 4 months.

I'm in volunteer withdrawal once again, this time (once again) the last time.

I'm on day 3 right now and I'm physically feeling alrightish~..

I tapered down with extended release tablets and the last few days with Kratom to get the worst part of SSRI w/d over without really noticing, that worked well so far.

So now let's get to my point: My nose is running, I'm sneezing like a panda and my limbs feel like I played 3 basketball games in a row (reference, anyone? :)). 
I can handle all that very well, but the following is killing me.

I have severe RLS (is it?) - that means i have to wiggle my legs all the time but that's not all. When I'm sitting down I have to literally move my whole body, just like I'm bouncing to a cool beat.

The second thing I just can't stand is the devastating anti-fun I'm feeling. Usually I love to play video games for example, but no matter what I start to do, I'm bored by it and find it a waste of time in a blink.

(Does not mean I do anything else that's not a waste of time, I'm just sitting there, wigglin' my body and hope that it ends..)

I took some Benzos the last 2 days and went for little walks. The walks helpes the wiggling sensation, but just as long as I was walking. Benzo didn't really help at all with that problem.

Is there anything I can do about those 2 problems, 'cause they are driving me crazy and make me want to take a shitload of Benzos to sleep the next 96 hours.

TL;DR: Tramadol withdrawal is pure hell.

Edit: If anyone has experiences with this withdrawal/feelings in particular, I could as well need some nice words.",1496736477.0

I'm sick to my stomach when I realize how much this pain is controlling my life. The fucked up part is that now my insurance does not want to cover the oxycodone or imaging. I do not get why they don't wanna cover imaging... how are we suppose to find out what the problem is?

Today I literally had to take double my oxycodone dose just to break the pain. Now I will probably be a day short. I also really wish my doc can put me on a patch or make changes to my opiates, but then again that is not something that is easy for my doctor to do I guess with the DEA and all.

Man oh man. It's just one of those days where I realize that I am slowly losing to my pain and my tolerance for opiates is also going up so it feels like I'm losing to my pain even more.

I lost my rank as a customer tonight. The days of skipping to the front of the line are gone. The days of freebies and fat sacks are gone. My loyalty club card membership was revoked tonight. The time, money, and effort I put into that card forgotten.  

I'm just glad I managed to cash in my bonus points last week before the sudden expiration. 

Man, I been so loyal to your ass I remember when you only had three customers. Pussy stay fucking shit up!

I knew the kitten issue would be brought up again, but the level of pettiness I'm witnessing is new. 

My dude comes over for his nightly delivery. Great, I've mentally prepared myself for this moment all day. Why does it have to be my kitten anyways? I know why I'm holding my ground, but what's his angle? 

At first he is nice and wanted to know if I was gonna let the cat leave with him. I told him no, that this isn't just some random TV we are talking about my animal. He told me he understood and promised that she will be well cared for. Even told me I could come visit, her sisters could even visit too! Brah. Don't insult my intelligence you just going to say anything at this point.

He keeps talking about how he needs her, absolutely needs her to be specific. It gets brought up if its for his son. Spoiler alert, it isn't. 

Seeing that I am not budging to his first attempts he would try a different approach. My actual order was out and ready but he still had his scale out to show me what he is willing to part with for this oh so kitten draped in some clear gold apparently. 

I told him don't even bother taking it out and showing me I'm not changing my mind. He slammed something of his that made a light dusting on counter. Aye, thanks homie. Every drop counts in this cold war. 

'MAN YOU GOT THREE OF THEM FOR FREE! I am giving you stuff that means you are ending up on top.'

Hold up. Wait. No matter how much you were about to give me you just sealed your fate in my eyes. I did not take in three kittens so I could flip the other two and end up a winner. Not every in a hustle, everything does not have a price tag. Hearing that made me certain she is better off with me, no matter how dope sick I may be at least I understand I have a living breathing thing that doesn't deserve to go from home to home or to the highest bidder. 

'I stay looking out for you, but the one time I ask for your help in return you refuse to. Thought you was better than that.' 

This confusing ass dealer/customer relationship is far from one sided you're well aware of that, it's been discussed enough to know that. 

At this point I'm wondering why he is even still in my living room arguing with me about this, yet to have given me a valid reason on why you need the cat so bad. 

The bickering the guilt tripping it all comes to and end when he finally huffs out my front door pissed he didn't get his way. I wonder off towards my kitchen when I hear him at my door again.

And here it is ladies and gentlemen, he has a girl with him. Not a little girl, a full grown girl that he is trying to give up my cat to so he could get his dick wet tonight. 'I just wanted you to meet the person who really wants the cat...' Uh. Um. I was legit speechless. 

UTTERLY FUCKING SPEECHLESS.

He asks for her to at least be able to see the cat. Why? Its absolutely not a chance in fucking hell happening now. 

My mom for some odd reason handed the girl the kitten. And what happens next just solidified the fact that I did the right thing in holding my ground, I most definitely fucked myself over but at least I knew what mattered most to me. But anywho, this kitten that has meet a handful of people at my house who loves all humans and never once acted funny towards one, until tonight. 

The girl reached out to grab the kitten and she started screaming bloody murder. She wouldn't calm down and somehow ended up trying to climb up my dudes jacket to which he promptly freaked out demanding the cat get off RIGHT MEOW because its touching his clothes. 

And on that note I walked away, I didn't say a word just faded away utterly confused and shocked at the shit storm I just witnessed. 

They hung around a few more minutes playing with all of the kittens. Apparently she fell in love with my favorite and even my dope boy shut her down immediately. Hey, at least he knew that was best to not even be considered. 

They asked if I'd reconsider before finally realizing it is in fact a pointless quest. 

And that folks of r/opiates is how my refusal to give up my kitten ruined my gravy train. 

WHOA! SHIT. SORRY. SCROLLING UP TO DOUBLE CHECK BEFORE POSTING AND ITS LONG AS DA FUCK. 

:( I need to learn less detail is acceptable too! Oh well, its already typed I'm leaving it for whoever wants to.

TLDR; My dude came back for round two of trying to take my kitten for dope. I still refused. He got increasingly upset with me and told me that he looks out for me that I need to return the favor. Only to find out that he wanted my sweet baby kitten to give to some girl he is trying to get at, he essentially wanted my pussy to get pussy. I kept the kitten despite his best efforts of changing my mind. And now he is obviously pissed at me.

I know I'm new here and don't know any of you guys but, I've been feeling a certain type of way these past few days. 

I shot dope for 6 years. 6 long fucking years. I know this may sound silly -but- I didnt know what heroin was (like, yea I heard the name but not exactly details) or what it would do to you -until- I met Matt (I've been with him for 7 years, he's in prison now for armed robbery 5 flat 5 post, he will be released in 2020). I didnt know he used at first. He hid it very well. Then he overdosed in the bathroom. So, now he felt he could do it freely in front of me. I would watch him shoot up and nod out. It looked fun. Now mind you at the time I had only done Meth (when i lived in Vegas), Coke here and there, pot, and drank. So, I asked him if I could try it. I started sniffing it. 2 bags and I would be rocked. That lasted maybe 2 weeks and I was asking him to show me how to shoot up. He refused. I said fine I'll ask Chuck -he hates Chuck-. Matt eventually gave in and shot me up for my first time February 12, 2010.


Now, mind you I had a good job, money in the bank, an apartment, electronics, a car...etc. Fucking GONE in a matter of months. We bounced from his parents house to our friends houses to the fucking park... 

Now before I go further - The shit I did when I was high or trying to find money to get high was disgusting. I'm not proud of it, but I feel like I can talk about it here. None of you fuckers know me lol So please, dont judge - I know its fucked up - I lived it. 

I'm a female, so as you can already expect -yes- I did have sex or do sexual acts for money. No I did not walk the streets. ok - so, I found a job making gun holsters - my boss was an erie county sheriff. He really liked me. I would just ask for money and he would give it. He put the security and first month rent on my apartment. I would go to work high - this place was crawling with cops - of course it was - I made fucking gun holsters. So blah blah blah i start doing favors for him for money - He actually found one of my craigslist ads.  So theres that guy - I had another one - who didnt want anything sexual just company and he paid me well. I would have sex with my drug dealers. 

I would rob wallets out of purses in the grocery store. My mom killed herself when I was 27 - my little brother called me, I went over, took all her jewelry, and left him (21y/o) to deal with the coroner. I would rob anyone. Didnt give a fuck who you were. 

When Matt got locked up - I went crazy - I lived on the streets for a while -lets not forget the 14 rehabs and countless detox's I was in- found a place to live - with another junkie - did some very very horrible things I don't even want to get into those. the only people who know are me and the other parties. I'm not there yet, to talk about it. Now by this time I had been at a 2g a day habit - may not sound like much to you, but it was a lot for me. It was hard trying to gather that much money 

I was a hot mess, skin and bones, i never fucking showered, only time i ate was after I got high and it was a little debbie snack or a dollar bag of chips. I continued on living this way, miserable... but i just wanted to get high. 

December 12,2015 something changed I guess. I checked myself in to detox - suffered through that, went to a 28 day program but stayed for 75 days (I knew if i left I would go get high), went to a long term inpatient rehab for 2 months (I got thrown out for calling someone a faggot), then finally I lived in an Oxford house for a year. 

I moved out of the Oxford house in March and into my stepdads house (I have the whole upstairs). I started school May 1st for cosmetology (yea yea its nothing special) and have been clean for 19 months. 

So, with all that being said - all the shit i lived through, how far I've come... I join this site, I found this sub, I lurk and read, look at pictures you guys post.... I WANT TO GET HIGH. 

I take a bus from where I live to my school -well 2 bus- I transfer to the second bus in my old stomping grounds. I've run in to some people i used to use with, a couple dealers, It's taken every fucking ounce of my being not to pick up. Why would I want to ruin what I have? All the shit I went through to get clean? Why would I want to go back to that life? 

It's not like in the past I would go off my psyc meds... I'm on them. I take them every day. I know this feeling or wanting to use will never go away but fuck its SO strong. I'm honestly scared I will get off the bus one day go in to a rite aid buy rigs and be off to the races. I purposely leave my money at home, i'll take $5/$10 with me. I dont know. I'm sorry for the rant. I just wanted to say it ""without"" saying it.",1496712072.0

I'm on the tail end of withdrawals. I ended up picking up and getting high in the middle of them (fucking again) so I decided to do what seemed like my best option - take naltrexone to put myself in PWD hell so I can get through the withdrawals and I can't get high. I can honestly say it was one of the worst experiences of my life, but it's almost over. I still feel like shit, but not as shitty as I felt yesterday. Rapid detox is not something to fuck with. No wonder they usually put people under anaesthesia for it.

6fhe5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6fhe5g/deal_with_the_devil/,23,https://redd.it/6fhe5g,sloan_fitch,Deal with the devil..,"*The letter based nomenclature has been replaced with names to address a facet of confusion in reading this post.*

~~Friend A~~ ~~ran out of dope~~Alf ran out of pills but indirectly knew my friend Ben, ~~Friend B~~ and Ben had a script of 15's in green. ~~Friend A~~Alf asked Ben what he can do. When Alf is really in need, he'll offer more than the normal price to ensure he can get something. Alf does not do dope/H. Ben on the other hand does both and sees an opportunity when this type of thing happens. Ben can sell his greens and buy more doses of H. 

One time Ben was making it difficult for Alf; he was basically trying to see how much he could bleed Alf monetarily. Alf said he works until 8 and that he'd be over ASAP, 15 minutes after. This turns into an updated eta of before 8:30. This I'm fine with, I trust Alf and Alf has no reason to run later than that. He may have given a shorter ETA at first in order to ensure commitment from Ben but not long after he did convey his revised ETA. Ben was hounding a lot about time.... a main factor had to do with the dboy. He can't tell dboy to come at 9, not have money and be like ""oops, Alf is late."" Okay I get that and he also feels that if Alf was already adding 15 mins to his ETA, it could still change his eta further so he was really on top of ensuring timing is okay. Either way, Alf did show up on time and even more surprising to me, dboy was basically on time as well.

&nbsp;

About a week or two later they do something similar except Ben did not try to make it into a frantic ordeal via txt in order to gouge Alf like he did last time. Then a few days a later Alf reaches out to me again and I inform Ben to see what he could do. They finally exchange numbers after this trade and a few days later, this is when things get interesting.

Ben was willing to sell or trade 5 greens for money that day but Alf got stuck at work with a customer so he arrived significantly later than planned. I don't think Ben had called his dboy to come over yet but either way he was pissed that Alf was so late because he claimed that it fucked up his ability to see dboy that night. Ben did ultimately see dboy for the following day so any negative effect of not seeing dboy the night before was negated or was able to be negated. **Nonetheless Alf was desperate for the pills and Ben indicated that he was not happy.** This is where the deal with the devil occurs; Ben somehow got Alf to agree to giving him 15 blues on script day for the 5 greens that he received immediately after running late from work. 

I still have trouble wrapping my head around how Ben justified this but I just think he found away to take advantage of Alf's desperation. Now today Alf ""had a story according to Ben."" Ben is pissed because he thinks he's gonna get screwed with regard to the original agreement. I've also been in contact with Alf, as I've asked him if he could loan me 2 blues till next week and I offered him a few bux more as interest. He didn't commit to anything but indicated that he'd keep me in mind.

&nbsp;

So the story that Alf told Ben seems to check out. Alf called me directly today to check if I knew about the pre-existing situation and arrangement between him and Ben. He also indicated that he couldn't afford to pay for his script today and that he'd have to go and buy from someone else in the mean time. Since he made a deal with the devil days earlier, he wants to at least cover some of his commitment. Well basically Alf intends on buying 7 blues, then wants to give 5 to Ben who wants and expects 15 despite that deal being a bit fucked up and over-inflated. Far from it for me to judge desperate actions, it is what was discussed days earlier between them even if it's a terrible deal. Just to be clear that deal was **5 greens for 15 blues a couple of days later. **

&nbsp;

Ben tells me he wants to help me out and gives me some disclaimers and indicates he cares about my well being because we all know the consequence of being in the game. More on that for another post. So get this, I guess **he knows Ben would be pissed if showed up at his house with 5 instead of 15.** As a result **his plan is to bring me 7 pills today. He suggests that I leave two at home and bring the other 5 to Ben.** Since I can understand his situation, I'm willing to be the messenger not to mention ~~Friend A~~ Alf is helping me out. I thought about telling Ben that Alf gave me 7 and offered two of them to me but then again *why be honest?* What if he needs more and demands them and offers me an enticing deal? I mean sure he'll make good on a trade.. but will I get settlement tomorrow or five days from now when I'm feeling sick wishing he wasn't full of shit?

Well, since it's ridiculous that I'd deliver 5 pills without getting any, I'm thinking a compromise. Once I receive the 7 pills, I'll leave one at home. I'll bring the 5 to A and will explain that B did give me one which is the 6th blue. How could he demand my one extra pill? Plus, I'm the one paying for that pill next week anyway so regardless I'll be indebted for it therefore making it my pill.

**I figure saying I was given 6 and that I'm keeping one is more realistic than saying ""I was given 5, none of them are for me.""** What could go wrong?

As for the remaining 10; that's on ~~Friend A~~ Alf to sort out with ~~Friend B~~ Ben when he has it. 

&nbsp;
______________________________________________________

**Update:**

Saw Alf since he came straight to my house. Gave me the 7 blues and we talked about things for a little. He's a good friend, we go way back even if we don't hang out as much as Ben and I. He also mentioned that before his phone battery dies that Ben texted him and said he wanted him to come over to discuss a business proposition or some shit. He said it in similar words. Alf didn't get back to Ben on that, but he figured that he must be up to something. I theorized that Ben was gonna propose some kind of business arrangement after Alf's script is fill. He can't do that yet because Alf has to wait for a check that is late in the mail partly because of the holiday weekend. 

Well, I spoke to Ben and he told me the alleged reason he wanted to speak to Alf. Basically he wanted to reduce the 15 pill debt to something more reasonable but guess ""that isn't happening since he didn't respond."" I texted Alf that updated info and told Ben that Alf's phone really died hence the reason he walked to my house. 

Funny thing is when Alf was generously bringing me what he was loaning me, he said ""I don't give a shit if you bring 4 pills to Ben and keep 3."" This would be as opposed to the original 5 for Ben, 2 for me. He also expressed his misgivings about doing business out of necessity with Alf as some of the respondents in the comments also expressed a level of agreement with. Others had trouble reading this, and I'll try to work on being more concise in the future.

They were both 12 panel(I think) saliva cube tests, so I had to suck/chew on this nasty cardboard-like sponge and put it back in the container when it was all wet. 
Since it's been a while from the last time they tested me, I'm not going to try to use because the probability that they'll do it soon is so likely.

So- from all my posting on here over the last few weeks, you may be familiar with me. I quit the Friday before last, went through Suboxone induction and quickly tapered off of subs.

At the height of my sickness before taking Suboxone, my cat died. And my girlfriend found out about my horrible, horrible secret (that I'm a junkie). 

So that was rough. But I did it, tapered off and had massive issues with sleep / motivation. Trazodone gives me a brutal hangover. Working on getting my adderall prescription again.

Anyway. After a week totally clean from opiates, I found 3 or 4 stamp bags in my apartment. Actually gave them away to a friend who's still using, breathed a sigh of relief.

But... Yesterday I found more, about a half gram. Sigh. So I did it all day. My tolerance was pretty much the same and I woke up this morning sick/frustrated as hell.

Mailing out Narcans today to the 4 lucky people who got to me first. Just asked my dealer for some more subs. This lifestyle sucks, guys and gals.

I'm not giving up!!!",1496681031.0

Can I make xtra & store?,"Hello, I won't list all my health problems. I'm 68 and in lots of pain. I have been on Hydrocodone immediate release for 15 years. Started at 5mg, but my tolerance and the level of pain go up about every 5 years, to where I need more medicine. I take 30mg at a time now and have had elevated liver readings a few times about 2 years ago. Logic says to get rid of the acetaminophen. I started CWE about 1 year ago. I can live with some pain, I'm a tough old geezer! So, I usually only take 1 dose a day at around 10am [ I don't get up until about 9am ] That usually gets me by and later I just watch TV, sitting with ice packs and heat compresses. Most of the pain is herniated and bulging discs in my lower back and neck, plus degenerative arthritis in my entire spine. I refuse surgery! Heard too many horror stories of failed surgeries. Anyway, what all this drivel is about is- I want to know if I can make up 2 or 3 days supply of pure hydrocodone after CWE and store it. I don't like having to wait on days I wake up in more extreme pain-if I did some heavy lifting etc the day before. Can and how could I store an extra dose or 2? Any special precautions?
That's my main question. Also wondering about CWE with Percocet-I have that too, but the pain relief doesn't last long enough-the H lasts about 6 hours for me-the P about 4- 4 1/2. Have to admit, I like the feeling that comes with 20-25mg Percocet [ oxycodone ] better=euphoria and energy. Question is: Why no euphoria or ""as much"" energy boost from Hydro as from Oxy?

I've come here because nobody knows addiction like a fellow junkie.

I'm 19 years old. Been drinking heavily since I was about 15 or 16, and I've really picked up in the last year or two. In the past year or so, I've drank anywhere from a 10-40+ ounces of whiskey every day. I got transferred to a new position at work where I can't really drink (used to be able to drink at work, now I can only drink on my breaks) so I've been going through some pretty gnarly withdrawals.

I'm looking ways to help with the WD's. I've been taking valium and Klonopin, and those help a little bit. Heroin has been the best thing I've found to help with DT's, but I've been broke recently and I don't wanna add heroin withdrawal to DT's. Haha

It's really on me for just trusting someone and not simply using google to search the pill number. So I started looking for plugs again, and either no one has oxy, or all these people selling ""oxy"" are selling hydroxyzine. Wtf. Is this an issue anywhere else?

My dealer seemed very impressed that I got off the needle and have stuck to smoking it and I can honestly say that I don't think I'll ever stick a needle in my arm/body again cuz one... I'm pretty much out of veins and two... Even if I did find some veins, it would be very short-lived before those are blown out too and then smoking my dope wouldn't be able to come close to touching my habit at that point and I'd be royally fucked.

So I wake up one day, do my wake-up shot which happens to be the last of what I've got in my lil oil slick container where I normally keep my personal stash of dope. I hit up my dude, and then once I finally get a reply and know that he is on his way, I decide to do a lil bit I had left stuck to my lil metal dabbing tool. I used it a lot for doing dabs as well as scraping up any dope that I spilled after bagging up a bunch of bags on my desk. There were two ends with lil scraper tools so I used one for dabs and one for dope. 

Well I see what appears to be about .1 maybe .15 and I'm like, ""tight, I'll fuck with this while I wait"". I cook it up and shoot it, feel nothing but wasn't surprised and didn't expect to feel anything cuz at this point I've got a dealer's habit, doing half gram shots at a time and barely feeling a buzz even with that. Well I'm waiting on my dude and he's taking a lil longer than expected (big surprise) so I decide to smoke some dabs I remember I had left on my tool while I wait when it hits me... omg I just injected a mixture of black/dabs earlier!!!

What I had cooked up earlier in a shot was actually mixture of dabs and black, mostly dabs cuz what I scraped up the night before was just a lil bit of black and I said fuck it and just scraped it up with the dabs figuring I would just smoke it up with my dabs cuz it wasn't nearly enough worth saving by itself

Surprisingly I never got an abcess or irritation from it which I would have thought it would have been super bad to shoot up BHO. So now when I see those ""injected 4 marijuanaz"" memes I crack up cuz I'm that guy

I knew if the lady looked, she would think it's water.

A little bit ago i picked up a little dope from my guy down in the pjs. Curb side service as usual. While i was waiting there for twenty minutes for him to make his 30 second trip down the elevator and to my car, i got my shit ready to do right there. Got the water in the rig, red bull can in my lap and cotton on my thigh. Got my dope, mixed it up. Ouch, missed a little. Fucking ow that burns wtf? Finished my shot then started to clean my rig real fast. I always shoot the first cleaner shot in my mouth. That's when i noticed it was sprite and not water I was using. God Damnit. No wonder that shit burned so fucking bad when i missed.

My question is, how bad is it for someone to inject sprite into their veins? I mean it can't be good, but it can't be super bad right? It is caffeine free.

6font6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6font6/for_those_who_use_kratom_to_quit_opiates/,7,https://redd.it/6font6,enoofofk,For those who use kratom to quit opiates,"I see a lot of people recommending kratom to help starve off withdrawals, and it definitely works. I just wanted to give a heads-up to those who don't know much about kratom.

I am a former opiate addict, who went the kratom route. It definitely helps with withdrawal, and can be a tool as a means to quit. But I wanted to also let people know that it isn't all fun and games, and it isn't ""harmless"" like a lot of people tout on reddit. 

If there are those people who want to get clean, using kratom as a tool to taper is useful. But all too often, it becomes the central drug instead of harder opiates. It also has a lot of downsides that I've experienced. 

The withdrawal from kratom after long term use is more mental that physical, and last a long time. Some people report not feeling better for more than 90 days. 
You will have opiate withdrawal symptoms. There are other alkaloids in kratom that are similar to SNRI drugs, and muscle relaxers. When you withdrawal from kratom, you are not only withdrawaling from the opiod, but also a series of other drugs. The mental depression is crushing, and lasts a very long time. 

As a tool to quit, it is definitely helpful. But please do be careful if you are using as maintenance. Please know what you are getting yourself into. It isn't ""harmless"" and it isn't like coffee. It is tough as fuck to get off it. 

In my experience, after long-term use, I became an isolated shell of myself. I was almost a sociopath, having no empathy for others, no real motivation to do anything, and had to carry around a bag of powder everywhere. I had zero sex drive ( similar to opiates), and a hard time maintaining erections. I saw no real difference between my previous addiction and kratom, although I could never die using kratom.

I read a post where someone was clean for 10 months, and posted about cravings. Another user recommended kratom and the guy went and bought some. I felt utter disappointment for that guy because I know what he just did to himself. 

Is kratom a safer alternative to full blown opiates? Probably, although no one knows what all the alkaloids do, nor the long term effects. But, you probably won't die on kratom.  

Is a great tool to help get off of opiates? Yes

Should it be used as maintenance? I say no. 

I know this is going to be controversial. I know that kratom can help a lot of people. But I also the pitfalls all too well. It is an opiod agonist. For those who want to be free from opiates, I wanted to post this as a disclaimer for kratom. It isn't easy to get off of it. It has an equal or worse PAWS. Please be careful with kratom, and try to use it only as a tool to get clean. Good luck everyone. ",1496782078.0

That was the last I had heard from the man, almost an hour ago. At first I thought the time was going by slowly due to the withdrawal symptoms – every junkie knows that among the most odious of WDS is the fact that time takes soooo much looonger but the clock wasn’t lying. Ali or Abdul or whatever guy it was this week (the names, at this point, were but an arab blend – bearded faces and deep brown eyes all around, rotating with every deportation and asylum grant) was late, and I was looking like a plague victim sitting in the ugliest subway tunnel in Berlin, hoping the man would show up before I shit my pants. Lack of bowel control is another withdrawal symptom, and I was getting there. Not quite, but I felt about hour or so from brown town. Just enough time for the man to show up, sell me dope, and me to scurry my ass home, probably to get high on the toilet. It’s a beautiful life we life.

A few more minutes passed as I contemplated the near future. Usually the guys work the tunnel all day, and I never have to even call them, so I was more than worried. To call a heroin dealer unreliable is an understatement. These guys could show up late or not at all to their own funerals. As I waited in silent agony, I watched the faces of commuters heading home and hipsters hopping trains with beers in their hands. I remembered what it was like to not be an addict, to go more than 16 hours sober without turning into a vomiting shivering mess. It was nice. I was on hour 12 or 13 and praying to the god I didn’t believe in for my arab savior to show up. The first time I had contacted him that day, about 3 hours prior, he had told me he’d be there in half an hour. Half an hour turned into an hour, and so on. It’s a strange time-dancing game and something endemic to drug-dealers everywhere. I often like to imagine that they’re all secretly high-speed intelligence agents or something similar, who desperately want to sell drugs but are too busy saving the world, and because of their obligations to the presidents and chancellors of the world, they’re often late and can’t tell you why or what they’re doing. They desperately want to apologize to you, but secrets are secrets, so they end up rolling up nonchalantly having to pretend that you haven’t been miserably waiting for hours because of them.

20 more minutes and 4 more trains rolled by. I sat on my bench, scribbling in my notebook with the vain hope that people wouldn’t assume that I was a junkie waiting for drugs.  Clearly, I was a successful (somewhat) happy (not really) master’s student (that part is true), waiting for a lover or dear friend to cut it up with. *Just waiting on a train, nothing weird about that. Ignore the hobo curled up on the other side of the bench, talking into her shoe. I have class, dammit! Did somebody pee into this trash can? What if everyone walking by thinks it was me? They all know I’m waiting for the dealer.* These thoughts, plus a thousand more, rushed through my head as I waited and imagined every passerby to be critically examining and judging me. Anxiety is a bitch, and, what a surprise – withdrawals make that a hundred times worse, too.

My feeble attempts at maintaining my dignity were shattered when another junkie wandered over and picked me out with a practiced eye. I’m sure she could see the barely-held-together desperation in my eyes as I frantically gazed back and forth for my guy, craning my neck to try to catch a glimpse of that curled black hair and those hi-top sneakers, when she stood in front of my bench. The middle-aged woman wore a filthy miniskirt, boots, and a Borussia-Dortmund sweater. She stared down at me from behind massive square sunglasses, her pockmarked face revealing nothing.

“Are you waiting for the guy?” She asked me, slurring her words in polish-accented german.

“I—what?” I stammered, wondering what to do. Reveal my true intentions? I thought I was so stealthy.

“The dealer, the dealer!” She exclaimed, flapping her arms around in a sweeping gesture. “The desert boy! I see you here before to buy!”

Her emphatic exclamations about “dealers” drew more than a few curious glances. The jig is up, I thought glumly. She recognized me from my buying here before. There are no secrets among junkies. I briefly considered getting up and walking out, but I knew if I did that my chances of scoring would be completely fucked. So I motioned quickly for the woman to sit down next to me and be quiet.

She flopped down onto the bench, leaning against me. Close quarters. I could smell liquor and the smell of a thousand smoked floor-cigarettes. Sure enough, as soon as she had sat down, her eyes widened and she reached under the bench, pulling out a half-smoked gunky handroll with the reverence of an explorer pulling an ancient artifact from a jungle cave. Smoking is verboten in the subway, but no fucks were given by her. Anarchy in berlin.

“I knew I see you here before,” she said loudly to me, obviously pleased. “I see you, babyface. Where is the mohammed?”  

“He told me 10 minutes, and that was almost an hour ago. I don’t think he’s coming.” I replied softly, trying to retain the tiniest amount of subtly, despite the people watching us – they must have thought she was a prostitute, propositioning an innocent student.

Her face fell. “I have no phone, what can I do, come here to buy but no one here! You sick boy! We find one for you. I know.”

“You know another dealer?” I asked.  I had already called my two backup guys and gotten voicemail. I could go cold cop, but that was the other side of the city, and it’s really not safe to do that anymore. You’re more likely to get some dirt or cigarette butt rolled up in a little plastic bag than any sort of drug. There’s no more goddamn honor anywhere these days.

As she opened her mouth to answer me, yet another junkie emerged from the throng of trainpeople and wandered over to our bench. Wonderful, I thought. This one was a rail-thin guy with a billy-goatee and dressed in a bright-blue jumpsuit that looked like it had seen better days, decades ago, when this part of the city was still East Berlin. His face fell when he immediately realized that there was no dealer here.

“It is the Jurgen!” the Polish lady exclaimed, happily hugging the newcomer.

“Yes, hello, where the fuck is the guy?” the man asked me impatiently in perfect german. Thank god. Sweat poured down his face. He looked a few hours from Brown Town himself. In the words of Mr. Lahey, “birds of a shit-feather flock together.”  

“We… don’t know, he’s not answering.” I murmured, looking straight ahead as if I was talking to myself.

“The Jurgen” smiled. “Everyone knows what you’re here for, man. They just don’t give a shit.” He read me like a goddamn book. An old lady standing nearby staring at the tracks but eavesdropping shamelessly shook her head, muttering to herself. Kids these days.

Alright, fuck it. I was at the point of physical discomfort where I truly stopped caring. Let me run into my boss or my friends, pretexts be damned. I yam what I yam, popeye said in my mind’s eye.

“Do you know anyone else we could go to? Someone trustworthy?” I asked, about to get up and run to the nearest detox clinic. End of the line. At least we have socialized medicine to go to as a last resort.

The two junkies stared at me, taking a moment to think. They looked at me, then each other, than back at me. At the same time they blurted out the same name:

“Bin Laden!”

Before I go any further, I think it’s necessary for me to give a bit of my own personal background. Before moving to Berlin and becoming a pathetic junkie, I lived in the United States. I did my undergrad there and spent 4 years as a soldier in the National Guard, deployed once to Afghanistan. I was once a clean-cut, respectable man, with all the discipline and bearing that comes with military service. The reason I became an addict is linked to my military service, but that’s a story for another day. Now, imagine my cognitive dissonance when I realized I was considering buying heroin from a guy named fucking Bin Laden.

Just to make sure, I repeated it: “…Bin Laden?”

“The Bin Laden very good!” the lady said matter-of-factly. “Little far the way, but no problems.”

I sighed. Of course his name was Bin Laden. I once stood soldier-straight but now I wore the Junkie Slouch.  What could I say? I had probably bought the Taliban at least a goat or two with all the dope I used. If I had known while I was in Afghanistan that I would later be an addict, I’m not sure whether I would have burnt down every poppy field we saw or palmed as much seized dope as I could. Like I said, there’s no goddamned honor these days. I hung on to a narrow strand of hope that it was a moniker, a stage name, that this heroin dealer would have nothing to do with the world’s largest exporter of heroin. The mental gymnastics we perform should have their own Olympics category. The sad headline: “Area man justifies giving a shit-ton of money to people who killed a bunch of his friends, and are killing him slowly, because he has no self control.”

“Uh, okay,"" I said, about to say something I never expected in my entire life to say: ""Let’s… let’s go see Bin Laden."" I don’t know why these two junkies wanted to stick with me, but that was how it was. Sometimes there is safety in numbers, sometimes a street-rat just wants to interact with someone else, be it another street-rat or a pathetic white-collar addict. I stood up from the bench, my knees cracking from being in the same position so long. I had a fleeting thought *of how much time do we waste feeding our addiction? How much could have been accomplished in this time period?* But it was an ugly thought, and I pushed it away to the place where those ugly thoughts go, with the practiced ease of one well-versed in acting against his own interests.

We waited for the next train to come through so we could catch a ride towards the elusive “Bin Laden”. As it rumbled to a stop, I tried to subtly ask Jurgen the name of the Polish woman with us. He shrugged. I thought about that for a second- they were obviously close, even probably shared a sleeping bag in a cardboard box during a cold winter night, but he still didn’t even know her name. We hopped in the train and the two junkies promptly sprawled out each on their own bench. I sat rigidly in a seat, once again unable to reveal to the world that I was one of them.

As Berlin passed by in a blur through my butted glass windows, I noticed people would board, only to get off at the next stop and get into another car of our train. I assumed it had something to do with the smell. After putting obscene amounts of drugs in my nose, I didn’t have the greatest sense of smell, but even I noticed our train car had the not-so-subtle eau de Addict: the funk of piss, sweat, unwashed body, and an undefinable odor that I can only describe as “the physical embodiment of the loss of human dignity.” Some people actually looked down their noses at the two supine junkies, a detail that I thought was a literary cliché. These peoples’ eyes would inevitably wander over to me, and I knew what they were thinking: *he’s one of them. Even if he doesn’t know it yet, he’s one of them, if not already, it’s only a matter of time.*

I began to wonder what my parents would think if they saw me, not knowing who I was. My mother, a product of the 70’s, more empathetic and caring than anyone I’ve ever met in the world. My father, the soldier, the disciplinarian, not so much. 

An unpleasant memory forced its way into my mind’s eye.

Me, 8 years old, walking with my older brother and my father out of Oriole Park after watching the Orioles play on a sunny Baltimore afternoon. Dad was a southerner, so he followed the Braves, but there was just something about being at a baseball game that 
 he loved. We loved it too. The crowd was thinning out as we moved away from the stadium. My older brother held my hand. As we rounded a corner back to the parking lot, my father stopped, looking at the end of a narrow alleyway we would have walked right past without noticing. When I saw what was happening in the alley, I immediately dropped my brother’s hand and covered my eyes.

*I tried to force this memory away, but it wouldn’t budge.*

“No,” my father said in a hollow voice. “You need to see it.”

I held my hands firm over my eyes. I realized that I heard unhushed grunting from the alley- a primal and filthy sound.

“I want you to look. Take your hands down NOW.”

Like I would later respond to drill sergeants, the command seemed to force my arms down as if controlling my very mind. My father had raised us to listen, damn it, and listen we did. I wish I hadn’t.

The first thing I noticed about the hobo in the alley wasn’t the crusty cock in his hands. It was his eyes. Although he was facing us, he was staring right through us as if into another world. His eyes, huge, bloodshot, and glazed, were half-focused and half-lidded. The skin of his face was pockmarked, scarred, and filled with burst capillaries (20 years later when I first saw a picture of Steve Bannon I immediately thought of “the hobo”). He wore an ancient corduroy ascot cap (the kind my father inexplicably called “faggot hats”) over a lion’s mane of oily hair. His beard looked like a giant single dreadlock. He wore only a massive Mexican poncho, stained and torn in all the wrong places. He held his filthy rotten cock, poking out from his poncho in a grotesque salute, in his hand, flagellating back and forth. *Squooshing it,* I thought, panicked. *He’s squooshing his peepee.*

My breath caught in my throat. The hobo snorted and grunted, continuing his obscene action. I was frozen in fear, unable to think, unable to move.  Beside me, my brother turned and vomited onto the ground with a loud “hurk”. The hobo began wheezing in and out. He was laughing. His grunts became louder, his movement faster. He began thrusting his hips back and forward.

“Okay, you can cover your eyes now,” I heard from my father, from a million miles away, the disgust evident in his own voice. It sounded like when you were in a swimming pool and tried to talk to your friends underwater. My hands shot up and mercifully my vision faded to black. But I could still hear him. The grunting, and wheezing, I tried to cover my ears but I couldn’t do that without moving my hands off of my eyes. I squirmed around, close to full-out panic. My father murmured something to my brother and I felt my brother lead me away. After a minute, I dropped my hands, unable to see the alley but hearing meaty thuds and high-pitched screams. I think I was crying a little and my brother hugged me. He was crying too. After a minute or an hour passed (children are useless at telling time) our father returned. To this day I have no idea what specifically happened in the alley but my dad had blood on his knuckles and didn’t say anything until we got back in the car.

“That’s what drugs do to you,” he said after 10 minutes of silence. The southern accent, usually well hidden, came out in full force as it always did when he was angry. “That filthy ol’ pervert used to be a normal person. You do enough dope, or crack, and that’s what you turn into.”

More uncomfortable silence. I was glad to be sitting in the back with my brother and not up front.

“I seen’t it myself,” my father continued gruffly. “Believe me, that could be your Uncle Johnny for all I know. He’s out there somewhere with the rest of the filth ever since he got on the dope. You needed to see it, and remember it. Stay the fuck away from that shit.”

My brother and I looked at each other in awe. That was the first and only time we had heard him use “the bad F word,” as we called it. The rest of the ride passed in silence, broken only by the click-clack of the turning signal and the soft rumbling of the drive. We ate dinner, told mom how great the game was, and I retired to bed without even touching my Legos, a rarity for me. 


*I'm never gonna do drugs,* I thought. *Never in a million years*.

As I drifted off to sleep, I felt those ghastly bloodshot eyes passing over me. From my closet I heard low grunting and dusty wheezing. Laughing, beckoning, waiting for me. When I woke up the next morning, my pillow was soaked, as if I had cried in my sleep.

Last night, upon viewing some advice on youtube I decided to encapsulate Kratom powder in hemp based rolling papers. When I woke up, I put it in my mouth like a pill and used a squirt-top water bottle to help me swallow it. I did this with three or four of my paper capsules with varying amounts of Kratom powder within.

From there I went to my kitchen, made some coffee (on cup #2 right now) and began to make some bacon and eggs. Prior to my second cup of coffee I administered more Kratom and one of the rolling papers was so tightly packed I ended up gagging and coughing it out. lol it came out as a cloud of green dust.. gosh it's kinda not that great of a flavor to say the least.

&nbsp;

Nonetheless, it has potential so I gotta keep a positive attitude about it despite the flavor. Maybe in the future I'll try to create a concoction of coffee, Kratom and Nesquik or Nesquik, milk and Kratom. **For today I just want to see how it affects me.**

It's 2:30 and I have work at 4:30. Since my last dope was consumed at 4AM and  I can usually go 24-hours without symptoms I'm confident I'll be fine for today. Not sure what else to expect. I still have one blue oxy left but I figured I'd test my will power and save it.

As of this time, I am open to advice regarding the use of Kratom. I'm mainly using it to avoid feeling sick but am open to experiencing the other effects and ways to potentiate.

&nbsp;

**Update:** Yeah, it seems to do the trick. I only dosed twice and the second time was an hour ago which is damned near bed time. Not the best idea since I mixed it with coffee directly this time but I figure the sedating effects will kick in sooner or later to counter that.

So I took my first dose before work and started yawning three hours into my shift. No WD symptoms. I'll repeat the process tomorrow and see how it goes. For tomorrow I'll may use a different, ""energizing"" Gold MD strain. I read that it helps to change the strain every day but I don't have that option until I order more next week. In the mean time I figure I can alternate between two strains. So Gold MD tomorrow, Red Bali the following day and repeat.

Now of course if there's a reason not to use Gold MD from Gaia tomorrow... please explain. I'm off from work tomorrow and work the following day. I figure the Red Bali will be good for work. I guess it depends on how I feel using the Gold MD tomorrow.

&nbsp;

**Update 2:**

It was suggested that I use orange juice or grapefruit juice instead of coffee. I just tried chocolate milk, it was clumpy but it basically worked to mask the taste. I also tossed and washed an additional two grams. I also had some coffee and am finally eating my breakfast. **Will be buying orange juice later today** and will update this post to reflect that experience. Kratom helped me get sleep last night despite the fact that I mixed it with coffee a couple of hours before bed. Woke up with mud butt, but I've felt stronger and worse symptoms before. So I'm hoping the OJ will make this easier and will potentiate it and that it'll prove helpful before work tomorrow. Luckily I work late tomorrow so everything I'm doing right now in the afternoon is like a mock-run of what I'll be doing tomorrow afternoon to ensure I'm well. Kratom + somthing to mix it with + morning coffee (no kratom mix!) + well rounded breakfast + hydration. That's the basic flow and plan.",1496774154.0

other expensive drugs include Midazolam - which apparently is like the golden benzo, nearly impossible to find outside a hospital but there's one vendor I know selling 15x10mg for huge price due to its availbility. same goes for Temazepam, 30x20mg cost me shit load but apparently it's one the real euphoric benzos.

but since this is opiate sub, what do you think is the deal with oxy and its price? is it just because people like snorting? since no other opiate can be snorted apart from #4 heroin. 

I have tried oxy orally and snorts and found it quite energetic and stimulating, nice but not the best ever, not to justify the price.

if you had a sudden burst of excess money, and you were a dope user, would you buy extra dope or would you get yourself some oxy to combine?

also there the choice of 5mg instant release oral, which I imagine 6-7 of those gets everyone blasted -- or there's the old NAPP 40mg formulas (OC) extended release which you just crush down and snort to defeat the time release..

I was snorting 10mg lines at the time and getting a 30min buzz. 

**tldr: is oxy worth the money and would you rather take it orally or snort it? and if you were to do either of these things, what kind of dose? I've read about guys with a 120mg a day habbit which I'd have to be a millionaire to fund**",1496768823.0

I also use black tar heroin maybe every other day, so typically .25 is plenty of dope on top of the methadone. 
   Now my friend has 60mg morphines, $15 a pop, is the morphine worth it? or should I stick to the dope? I'm an IV user and would love to see what the morphine rush is like but I don't know what a good dose would be? With the daily methadone dose, a . 2 shot of dope has the perfect rush and high  for me. 
   Thank you any input would be appreciated. I don't want to shoot $30 worth of morphine and get nothing when I know a $20 shot of dope does me good. ",1496768303.0

No judgement here.

A few years ago the hospital fucked up my morphine drip rig and gave me multiple times the dose I was supposed to have. I was given an injection of narcan into my IV by a very inexperienced nurse and what followed was the worst experience of my life. 

I felt nothing at first. Then I felt like menthol was leaking out of my spine and moving out through my body. My heartrate skyrocketed and I felt like I was flying forward on a roller coaster. My hands were shaking with adrenaline. I was hyperventalating and breathing loudly. I was hot and cold (sweating and shivering). My eyes dialated and I had full on black outlined tunnel vision. The room was echoey and things moved weird. My skin itched and burned like it had ants in it. Time passed slow but I couldnt remember how much had passed. All I could do was stare forward and focus on trying to forget the pain. Docs said I was like this for 45 minutes to an hour.

After that my heart rate dropped back down and I went to sleep from being so fatigued.

Is that normal for narcan?

Anyway, I'm wondering what the trick is, so to speak, for guaranteed hitting a vein and successfully shooting. I snort and have IV used before, I just never stuck with it because I just love snorting and everything with it, besides the high. Also I never stuck (ha) with IV because I've never ever been able to successfully hit. There has only been one time in about a year that I've been able to hit myself. Funny story-- I remember about 2 months ago when I tried to do it I had a fresh rig w no dope or water in it and I wanted to hit a vein so I could ""know"" how to do it when it came down to it. (Keep in mind this wasn't my first time shooting). I stuck the rig into my vein and hit successfully, pulled back the blood and it was flawless. Removed it, cleaned it, prepped the shot, and went to hit myself. Couldn't do it. I'm like what the fuck! Put the 'solution' back into the spoon, cleaned it, hit my vein. I'm like WHAT THE FUCK?! 
Put the dope in it, went to hit, and couldn't do it.

I'm good but someone got hurt.,"Ben and Jerry are two friends of mine, well the latter is more of an acquaintance. Jerry isn't supposed to know that I do dope but he either guessed it, or Ben slipped and told him. Sometimes Jerry depends on Ben to get a ride to cop. Many times Jerry tries to scheme. 

&nbsp; 

A long time ago when Jerry used to middle for Ben, he'd get bags of dope with tape on them. One day Ben met the guy Jerry was seeing and found out that he does not put tape on the bags. It turns out that Jerry was skimming from each bag and then putting tape on them to give the illusion that nobody dipped. These days Ben only sees Jerry when when he absolutely needs to.

&nbsp; 

Today Jerry comes to my place and knocks. He informs me that he's picking up and wanted to know if I wanted to jump on the order. I'm already surprised by this but decide to roll with it by telling him the truth, ""I don't have any money."" He then shits on the product that we usually get and informs me that he's getting something better that he'd like to share with me. He also said that he was getting a sample for Ben to test. In fact he said that he was gonna take something out of Ben's sample to share with me. I declined and told him to give the whole sample to Ben.

&nbsp; 

Fast forward, I visit Ben to eat some pizza. I also bought over some Kratom so he could try it with his OJ when his dope starts to wear off. I personally have to wait four more days before I can get any dope so I'm coping with the help of Kratom and low expectations of getting even a morsel of dope in the mean time. The Kratom seems to work well 'nuff for me although my shits could be more solid. I'm sure that'll improve in a day or two.

&nbsp; 

Well, anyway..  it gets interesting. It turns out that Jerry was selling blue diabetes medication with another partner to other pill addicts. One guy went to snort a pill and puked almost immediately. Upon identifying the numbers on the side opposite of the M he realized why. As a result, two guys showed up at Jerry's house, and someone got pistol whipped as well. As a further result it would appear that Jerry was given an ultimatum and will likely be going away to rehab for a month. Not sure if we believe him on the last part until we see it happen. At risk of being judgemental, he could probably use help since he also buys crack because dope isn't doing the trick for him these days.

&nbsp;

**Addendum:**

There really isn't much to add to this story at this time. It has been established that Jerry (fake name of course) is full of shit so we don't know if he's really going to rehab. It should also be noted that he gave Ben a bag of dope the other day that tasted like chicken stock. Ben says it did not get him high. As for me, I just boiled up some kratom in a pot filled with two cups of water. I then placed a coffee filter atop a thermos and affixed it in place with a couple of rubber bands and pored the green sludge water over it. It should be noted that it taste bitter but quite like any other tea. I disposed of the source powder although some would recommend drinking that too. ",1496881605.0

I started my apprenticeship in 2012, around the same time I discovered I am able AND rightfully allowed to legally order Tramadol as much as I want where I'm from. 
(As well as Codein and DHC btw, loopholes in law crashed my life.)

Since I've tried Trams a handful times before, I thought hey, it's a weak opiate and I don't have to deal with shady dealers.

So I ordered my first 100ml bottle of 100mg/ml solution, right out of a legal pharmacy, without any prescription, without any appointment. 
(Usually you need a prescription over here.)

You all probably know how this route turns out - I worked hard, had fun, was funny at parties - all the pro's.

So I went on ordering and doing it every day, I even knew what I was doing from the first day, I knew about addiction, I knew about withdrawal, I saw all those movies.
All in all: I just didn't care, the pro's outweighted the con's tremendously by that time.

The only problems I encountered the next 3 years were acting in the shadows, lying to friends and family and always needing to hide something. (And, of course, jammin' it until it's red and hurts.. Pro and Con at the same time.)
'Till this day only 2 people know about my addiction, one of them is my gf. 

So after around 3 years I started to feel that things weren't that funny anymore.
I didn't care about the thousands of € I had paid yet.

What I DID care about, was the more I kept on reading the last years, the more I really understood what I'm doing to my body and soul.

It's not just the opiate related underweight and all that, moreover I became worried about my Serotonin-/Dopamin- and Noradrenalinreceptors.
I had fired them up over years, every - fucking - second.

So I decided to quit and didn't order the next bottle, I'd just go cold turkey and end it, it's not worth it.
**Ha. Ha.**

24 hours after my last (at this points we are around 2014/2015)  dose I started to realize what I had done.
I got all the flu-like symptoms, I could deal with that.

But then the zaps started to happen. The boredom. The depression. 
Long story short, withdrawing from a SSRI with opiate-ish attributes is no fun at all and takes LONG.

**I was clean for *FOUR* GOD DAMNED MONTHS.**

I thought I did it, I'm free.
The feeling to go out and not checking my pockets if I have my secret-stuff with me was awesome. The chains were broken.

As we all know - **nope.**

Innert the four months I had days which hit me hard. The craving came out of nowhere. A known place, a known smell, just a shadow in my eye, reminding me of a time of pure happiness. (Huh?)

I was sober, completely sober, when I ordered another bottle of that devil.

The whole story started again, just way worse than last time.

I want to mention that I never neglected my ""career"", I finished my apprenticeship and the way I chose after that (further education, didn't want to work in that job) pretty well.

This time, it wasn't pure fun. It was fun for about ONE week.
After that with every dose I got depressed and anxious like never before. But I just couldn't stop.
Every dose made me feel like crap for several hours, but I continued to dose and dose and dose.

So here I am, several withdrawals and relapses later (the longest break after the first relapse was actually 2 weeks..).

Today I am on day 4 of withdrawal, the ""flu"" is mostly gone, my body still zaps and my legs are imitating shuffle-dancing all the day.

Today was the first day I could focus on anything longer than 2 minutes without losing any fun. 
I feel like I won't be able to live a normal life ever again, have fun like usual people have, ever again.

I don't believe in god, but whoever created this planet, me and Tramadol, I swear to you this time it is over.",1496860213.0

I was always way better at the sciences and maths but damn do i wish i could write.. 

I dont even know where im going with all that ive been up for 2 days, yesterday was my birthday and i went hard. 

Ive been fucking with opiates for 8 years now, 5 years for real real. And through it all ive managed to keep a grasp on my life..im fucking high everyday but i graduated, got a job i love, pay my bills, own my car ..like legit things that convinced me my problem wasnt so bad. 5 years ive been taking care of my shit. 

5 years..and then 5 months ago i started fucking with heroin and then the needle within the last month or so. And my shit is falling apart ..fast. i recently tried speedballs, smartly threw my face on this sub when i was allll fucked up. Lol. But thats just a weak example to make my point,  every line i said i would not cross i have crossed since i started using heroin..*most* every line.  

IVing is my downfall. Ive been up the past two days fucking with speedballs , i can barely describe a potato so to put into words what that rush feels like..its out of this world. it makes me rip off all my clothes and say holyy fuck over and over. Speed makes me fucking stupid. Like all these rules i have set for myself out the window, yeah bitch why dont you have a bunch of shady strangers over, let them see your sweet turntables and big ass tv and consols and shit, oh ya..show em where you keep a lot of your guns..fucking GREAT idea. I am so livid with myself when i think about the fucking dumbass shit ive done the past week. seriously, im fucking DUMB. Speed is not for me.

I used all my vacation and took a month off from work. To get clean, to get straight, to enjoy nature and my dogs, and just take a break from the grind that is my job. Backfired so far because ive been more fucked up these past 5 days than i have in..ever? I guess a m-f job really helps me stay in line. 

Im looking at detox. I gotta do something, im legit terrified. My dogs are my world, and fuck, im at the point now where i have no one to trust to take care of them if i did an Inpatient. I dont even trust leaving my house unoccupied for long because ive,let alot of shady people into my life since i started fucking with H.

So i duno..i should end this rant. I guess if youre still reading and you havnt picked up the needle, im just another person on this sub begging you not too..it will without a doubt FUCK your life up. You think you have your shit together and then its gone.

I've taken a solid amount of different substances, from LSD to DMT and tons of mushrooms. Coke was a favorite, ambien a close second, oxy a few times etc etc

Anyway, a close friend of mine picked up a small heroin habit against my advising and he seems fine, doing better than he was before, but that's no excuse to start. 

I've heeded the warnings here about dabbling with the devil, but my curiousity grows each time I visit the forum. 

My personal experience with opiates is little. I tried a few 40oxys awhile back and didn't enjoy them much. Couldn't crush them, and ended up getting serotonin poisoning because I combined them with a few anti depressant meds (oops) 

Lately I stumbled on a stash of hydrocodone, and after being sober for two months off a nasty Coke habit (talking like 8g binges at the least) I wanted to indulge in a substance again. 

I prefer to rail things, my experiences from Coke becoming preference. The gold dust of Vicodin was a pleasing experience. 
Uplifted my mood, gave me tingles, kinda liked the itch, the nod was respectable. 
I guess what I'm really trying to get at is I have a creeping curiousity for the opiate side of drugs. I try to keep things to a minimum, about 3 Vic's and I'm good for a day no withdraws or any thing can just go about life right now until the thought pops up.


Would it be superbly unwise to venture further with this? Not to eventually heroin because I don't think I could over come the mental barriers to buy and do it, but the pills are just as much of a slippery slope are they not??

TLDR: got a stash railed 3 hydrocodones I'm a little lit and wanna say what's up! Newbie around here. ",1496857566.0

I've never hid my usage from anybody. Nobody ever looked at me sideways. The only people I didn't tell was my brother and grandpa, they'd been through enough with my dad I guess I didn't want to hurt them. I always seemed stable enough that nobody really assumed how bad off I was I suppose.

They're super strong for me. But I decided to get off dope for good and bought three subs I had a minor relapse in between I did four bags. I found out some bad news blah blah. At first I figured just one or two subs but bought the third after the lapse. Now at sub #3 and I'm trying to go as long as I can without it but it's only a day I get nauseous and a little sweaty when I wake up. I haven't had a day off in weeks I have two jobs my full time is 12 hour shifts every day. So maybe I'm suffering from exhaustion? Any ideas or advice would be great. ,1497002911.0

I need advice badly.,"I feel stupid asking these things. But this entire thing is outside my personal realm of experience.

I have something coming up, where I will NEED to use severe painkillers in order to avoid a ridiculous amount of pain, as it happens. Shield myself from the pain, preferably without getting overly high, as I need to be able to function. It won't be in a medical environment... it will be at home. Alone. I can't/won't be more specific than that.

I've been trying to research online. This will be a one-time thing for me. I *think* what I need will be OC 10mg IR? From what I can find online, that might do the trick.

I have absolutely zero experience with not only opioids, but literally any drugs or pain medicine other than ibuprofen. Therefore I will have zero tolerance going into this. And I will be doing it alone.

I need advice. Does 10mg IR sound like the right dose for a complete first time user? What exactly do I need to look for when purchasing in order to avoid tainted or fake pills? Will simply taking the pill(s) as normal have the desired effect of a pain shield? Or do I need to take it in some other manner? I will be doing this *one* time only, and I know there are things I need to know that I don't even know how to ask, or what they are.

I am completely serious with this post. I *must* do this, and it is going to happen. With or without advice I will risk it, but I am trying to minimize my risks by asking people who have information I need. Please help, if you can. Thank you.",1496997911.0

This my friends has nothing to do with anything. (Prewarning, this post will be all over the place my mind tends to wander, especially when I relapse.)

Background:
     East coaster here, east coast stand up! I'm 26 years yould. I've been using for the vast majority of 10 years. I started off with the occasional 512 and i graduated to ECP about a year and a half ago. I went a year without opiates somewhere between the ages of 19-22. I can't tell you when because I wasn't remotely sober I was using ecstasy  and rocaine drinking like a fish.

Backtrack:
    It feels like yesterday, one of my best friends (1/2 of my friends) literally died on my shoulder lastyear. (we'll call him AK) He overdosed on a schmorgesboard (sp?) of opiates and Brozos and Lord knows what else. God rest his soul I drove him to the police station as soon as he went out and was harassed in an eye-opening manner.
     I was driving AK's car because he was too fucked up to function. It was after his last bag. I've accepted he was killing himself that day and he was set on it. ""I just need one more, I just need one more"" I understand why AK just needed one more now, that's all it took. He was a smart mufucka his math was spot on.
    When AK went out on my shoulder we were listening to ""Belly- money go""
     Which in retrospect and if you watch the music video and listen to the lyrics is pretty fitting. We had just pulled into his driveway. I thought he was sleeping I pushed AK and said ""honey wakeup were home...""
      His head bounced off the window *THUD* and back to my shoulder. *IMMEDIATE PANIC SETS IN*
*SHAKE SLAP ""AK!!!"" SHAKE SLAP*
""Wake the fuck up AK ""SHAKE"" 
I quickly contemplated punching him in the jaw but I can see his chest moving and had a brief moment of clarity, how's knocking him more unconscious going to bring him back to consciousness. I check for a pulse instead, it's extremely faint. It was more like digging for a pulse but his jugular's still beating. 
     He lives about 6 minutes from the police station. (*Fact googled* very low speed limits) I make it there in less than 2 minutes. (Drove like I had ambulance lights on)
       I park the car infront infront of the front door run in, there's no dispatcher, no one to be seen. I'm screaming for help and Narcane. 8 officers saunter out all in full uniform. None of them happen to have their narcane on them.... which is complete bullshit, their required to carry it in my state. I call them out on it, they say they can't find it. Idk what I said at this point but it's not kosher.
      I then suggest we lay him on the ground for when the paramedics showed up because he's slumped in the passenger seat, not one of them lends a hand. It's the fent thing where their not suppose to touch him. I check again he's still got a pulse. That's when I start picking him up by myself....

I'm LB rushed and slammed into the rear passenger door. Then told to ""back the fuck up and not touch him"" Officer slammy amongst 6 cockworkers, said ""tell us where you got it and we'll give him narcane...,""
      I reply ""if I knew we could go in their guns blazing and shoot up the whole trap."" Sir' slammy tries to throw me at a concrete wall, yet still no physical damage is sustained. His attack was brute but he missed ""Arms on the wall"" time for an illegal search.... fuck giving AM narcane let's try to arrest the man who brought him.
      Nothing's found yet he insists I admit I'm high and I give up ""my drugs"", and AK'S dealer. I hit him with the omnipresent no 3x in a row. 
        Then he hits me with my favorite line.... "" I  wish I could take you out back and beat the shit out of you!"" I make Gay jokes / I'm from the I wish a ninja woods. 
       He's livid, I'm closer than I've ever been to hitting an officer but that's what he wants and all I want is my Best friend to live....
       He's told to go inside by the chief, 5 cops remain right as the paramedics show up. Id assume it's been 15 minutes, that's about how far the hospital is that the ambulance came from. I had no idea that hospital existed until that day.
     The paramedic asks for help putting him on the ground. He states he still has a pulse. The cop takes his shoulders and bounced his head off the ground. I yell at him for that. He smiles. 
      The paramedic then asks ""so are you going to give him narcane"" one cop pulls it out of his pouch and stares me in the eyes as he does. My anger disapates and sadness overwhelms me, tears run down my cheeks.  I can't believe the lack of compassion. This is someone's son, he only knows karma as a stripper, not someone's daughter.  I really wanted to believe they didn't have anymore on hand, ignorance is bliss.
      The cop administers the narcane while still staring me in the eyes. No response, but color returns to his cheeks.  I'm yelling for AK to come back. Begging god, pleading. I havnt spoken to him in so long he has no idea whos calling
      They administer another shot, the color in his face disappears, I'm begging/pleading god. Nothing.... I pray for his soul.

Originally: 
I relapsed after 2 months of sobriety. Had a fuck fest with a beautiful women (call he jess) over the weekend.... we hook up once every few months. She always has a new guy that she's trying to be serious with and isn't committed to... She always tells these guys about what we did and then tells me we can't talk, its to much of a temptation
That's fine. (This was yesterday) It's her praying mantis nature. I was going to whine about the fact that another girl, who does the exact same thing to me every month or two. Told me today the same thing... I was going to get in depth about this.. but the above is what cameout. I'm still depressed as fuck. Me and AK chilled almost everyday last summer, oh and my other Best friend only wants to hangout if free drugs are involved for him or if he can extort me in some way shape or form... he's always broke. Has no job and yeah.

Back in feb i got admitted into the hospital with double pneumonia in both my lungs. This was right after a knee surgery. at the age of 26. After a week there my pneumonia caused a blood clot from my leg go into my chest causing pulmonary embolism.

I got rushed into ICU. I was there for 5 weeks!!! The most insane pain i ever felt. I wouldnt say more than 5 words without crying and SCREAMING in pain. When i was in the normal unit i got injected with morphine every 5 hours. help a lot with pain. Once i had this new level of pain they bumped me up to injections of dilaudid every 2 HOURS! 

I have never taken any hard drugs and this shit was like NOTHING ive ever felt before. when i got this injected i felt it go through my entire body then rush to my bed and would make me pass out in a slumber all within a fucking minute!

The more and more i got it i gained very very few tolerance to saying up few extra minutes. depending on who was visiting me i would try to stay up and talk to them since it was comforting to have visitors. 

This is when things got, interesting. I have very very few memories from my time in the hospital but i remember slightly when id try to stay up i would be tripping LIKE CRAZY! Saw things and felt things id never thought i could see or feel, ever. 

My nurses would tell me that dilaudid is pretty serious and a lot of heroin addicts get put on it to help them wind off heroin . The hospital would give me the injections even when i was sleeping since my heart rate was constantly 200 bpm when i was SLEEPING! they would inject me while i sleep to relax my body when asleep.


I was on it for a good 4 weeks STRAIGHT. Everyday, every 2 hours or even sooner depending on what tests i had to do and how much moving around i did.

When i was taken off it. I pretty much 100% had a withdrawal.  constant chills, feeling sick form not having it. the smell and sight of food made me sick and i didnt eat for 4 days. All that and i pretty much wanted to fucking GET OUT of there the second they took me off!

Every since all that. I had another knee surgery and have been having to take pain killers but i am so damn immune and have a very high tolerance for pain killers now to a point i honesty need about 5/6 percocets for them to take effect on me.

Both the morphine and dilaudid were injections in a dedicated IV. Im not sure the MG for the dilaudid but anytime they went to inject me they let me pick morphine or dilaudid. I picked morphine a few times after being on dilaudid for so long and it did absolutly nothing for me since i was so used to dilaudid",1496989779.0

In this age of information and technology, every facet of society around the world can communicate freely without fear of retribution from any government or form of power lest we forgo democracy for fascism. From minds greater than ours, we on r/opiates have collectively determined that a form of harm reduction is the best route towards healing the wounds created by the drug war and issues created by the users themselves. r/opiates is a community of like-minded human beings who are part of a counter culture; however, our counter culture is now becoming the norm. Everyone, whether they like to admit it or not, is affected by this ""epidemic"" as the media calls it. We simply call it ""life"". Through r/opiates, hundreds of lives have been saved and tens of thousands have a place to inquire about things they cannot freely ask about anywhere else. Whether you agree or not is irrelevant. This is not a new phenomenon; opiates have existed for thousands of years and will continue to last longer than every line in the sand or arbitrary law. As a community we come together for free access to knowledge and to describe our sorrows, our strengths, and celebrate what makes us happy. It has to be said that any form of selling, bargaining, attaining, or begging for illicit substances is against the rules of the subreddit, which you can clearly see if you read the sidebar information. With the access to the free information that we provide, we continue the harm reduction movement and provide a safe and fun environment for adults from around the world to communicate. Find it within yourselves to understand that, since you as an individual can't solve this problem, we have created a community to alleviate the issues caused by the shroud that addiction pulls over us.

The US government spends 500 dollars a minute on the war on drugs. That ends up being 15 billion dollars a year. And what does our country have to show for it? Deaths related to opiate addiction are at an all-time high right now.

R/opiates is an all-encompassing place for adult opiate addicts to find harm reduction information and support. We offer a supportive place for a marginalized group of society to share their struggles with addiction. We help people find resources if they request it, and we offer a place to share without judgement. We do our best as a community to steer folks who are just starting out away from opiate use. We on this subreddit are dedicated to helping people. This sub is only for adults ages 18+ and we do not allow any type of drug sourcing here, as it clearly states in our rules. We strictly enforce these rules. We feel as a community that promoting support and harm reduction is key in helping people, as it's been proven that traditional methods are not helping at all.

People who already use come here to learn about how to use more safely. How not to get infections, how not to overdose. New users are warned against using opiates at all. People who want to get clean are supported. We are not turning non-users into addicts, we are spreading information that will keep addicts as healthy as possible. Technology is how many folks get information on Harm Reduction. We are a support group that covers all ""stages of change"". This subreddit is important because it connects people to harm reduction information and moral support that they can’t or don’t get in real life. With so many people turning to the internet for support nowadays, it is even more critical that this subreddit exists for them.

We encourage you to spend some time REALLY looking at our subreddit, and seeing what this place is REALLY about.",1496988105.0

Honestly, I just need some honest feedback. I'm at a loss for this entire situation.

I've been with this guy ""Matt"" for 7 years. He was the person who first shot me up/got me started with heroin - but it wasn't right away. We had some time together without drugs (he was clean - but I didn't know he had a problem). I really truly with all of my being love him. He's been upstate for 2 1/2 years - I haven't been with anyone else. 

there's a cycle that's been happening - I will write him consistently then I just stop. I don't know why I stop - school has been the reason lately.

In the past (before I got clean and after) he asks me to bring shit in to the prison for him. Fucking no, no god damn way will I do that high or sober. It's a fucking felony. He knows I wont do it.

I get a letter in the mail from him today. (attached - I couldn't pick so I linked 2 - he cant spell worth a shit)

http://i.imgur.com/GBUaTSe.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/NE6kbIT.jpg

Now what the fuck? Who the fuck does he think he is? Trying to tell me how things are going to be when he's in prison. He has lost his fucking mind. He knows I'm clean - why the fuck would he send me back to the streets to look for drugs/suboxone? That's putting me and my sobriety in jeopardy - does he not realize this or does he just not give a shit? Also - bringing it in to the prison - I'm a horrible fucking liar - like you can just see it all over me. He knows this. I would fucking 100% get caught without a fucking doubt - not to mention NY has the x-ray machine thing - you sit in a chair and they can see whats in you.

He knows I don't have a fucking job and I'm in school - how the fuck can I send him things with money I don't have? I was spending $80 a month from my ~~food stamps~~ and sending him packages - but I stopped, idk why - I just stopped.

AND he says he says I think that he needs me - and that I should take another fucking guess because I thought wrong - well what the fuck... he obviously does need me with all of these demands.

I'm getting a very nice chunk of change from my school refund in August - I told him I would hold him down with that (food, cigs, books, commissary). 

If he can't stay clean in there - how will he stay clean when he gets out and on parole. His brother overdosed and died last October - He comes from a WONDERFUL family. His parents are amazing. They treat me as their own - I've been to every holiday even since he's been locked up. His mother is just sick over all of this - him being in prison, acting like this, and of course his brother. I would think he would have gotten his shit together in there. But, I don't know what it's like being in there, so I sometimes feel bad (is that making excuses?).

At this point I really don't know what to do. Should I let him act like this? Should I just say fuck it and bring it in? I mean, will he *REALLY* stop talking to me if I don't do as he asks? 

Sorry if this is all over the place - I'm no good at writing.

So that is where I am currently at...I am really getting scared about methadone. Not only is it super irritating that I need to go to the clinic to get dosed everyday, but as I'm sure you all have, have heard absolute war stories about this medication and how it is truly the absolute worse drug to get off of. Only reason I decided to give it a shot, is because I mentally just cannot handle another detox off of bth. It just drives me absolutely bezerk! Even with clonidine and a little xanax I get massive anxiety like beyond belief as well as zero sleep and just terrible pains at night. However, in the long run thinking that detoxing may be better overall than going to the methadone clinic every single day for months on end and potentially developing an addiction that may be almost impossible to get off of. The methadone doctor has told me that it getting off of it really will not be bad with an extremely slow taper over a several month period of time. However, just thinking of going to the clinic every single day for at least 6 months and maybe in 3 months getting like 2 days of take homes here and there sounds insane. I will literally be a slave to the clinic every single day and will get sick if I don't go. Also so far I have already still been using bth everyday anyways....so it almost seems like I am going to just wind up with a double addiction from hell. 

What should I do? I am thinking I should honestly just stop the methadone right now before I become physically addicted and just continue using bth and eventually detox and get on suboxone. Out of curiosity, if I were to stop using bth after tonight and hypothetically wait 18-24 hours and then get on suboxone, would I get precipitated w/d because if the methadone? The time would be enough to avoid precipitated from bth, but not sure if I will be in the clear because if the methadone's half life? I have ONLY been taking it for 3 days, so I am wondering if it will even be possible to get precipitated w/d from it because my body is not physically dependent on it. If I were to manly use oxy or bth for 3 days and then use suboxone in less than 18 hours, I will definitely NOT have any precipitated w/d because my body would not be physically dependent on them at that point. Is this the same with methadone though?

If I take suboxone in 24 hours from my last bth dose tonight, let's says around 10pm tonight and last dose of methadone was at about 10:30am this morning, would I have to worry about precipitated w/d from the suboxone if I were to take it around 7:30pm-10:30pm tomorrow night ?? What are your guys opinions? 

Just in general any thoughts about how I should tackle this situation? Regardless or not if I wind up relapsing again, which is very likely, I just want to at least try to be clean again! I have about 275mg of methadone liquid take home bottles that I have separately as well that may help this situation if you guys can think of a good plan? I was originally planning to taper with methadone on my own, but just couldn't do it. ",1496968775.0

I wonder since he's been doing it so long if the muscle in his one eye has set it to where he looks cock eyed now. 

Of course during his addiction he wasn't a part of our sons life. He's on suboxone now and he's trying to make up for that time and also help my dad around the garden and yard so I've seen him more this last 2 weeks than I have the last year. 

I don't want to ask him, because I know if I had a cock eye I'd be embarrassed about it. But who knows, maybe he doesn't even know he has it because when you look in the mirror I'd assume you couldn't see it.

I have learned that there is an important distinction to be made between opiate dependence and opiate addiction. I am comfortable with the stigma of being an opiate user if it allows me to be a  functional member of society and being pain free while doing so. In February, I cut my hand while plucking an avocado seed and severed 2 tendons in my hand that required surgery. The tendon ruptured after a month and I had another surgery.

Now I will explain my medical history. I was diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis at age 8. I took a variety of medications until I was about 18. At 14 years old I was diagnosed with TMJ and had 2 surgical procedures one at age 17 the other 2 years later at age 19.  19 years old I suffered testicular torsion which resulted in the removal of one my testes (most painful experience in my life). My knees, if you place your hand on them and I bend them you can feel the grinding, you can also hear it. Bending my knees is a very difficult and painful process. And I am only 33 years old. I have a recommendation for a doctor but they require an MRI. I called the MRI place and they said they need a referral from the Doctor and that it is $250 for an MRI. People have told me that you have to have something wrong with you back on your MRI, others have said that if your a male over the age of 30 stuff is gonna show up in your MRI of your back that could get you pain meds.

Day 0 I spread a 30mg oxy throughout the whole day. Half before work, half after work. The day before I had the same amount. The days before that I had gradually decreasing amounts of heroin to snort. 

Anyway, at this point I've felt worse before. I hope I can feel less worse.

&nbsp;

It's hard to avoid doing another bag when I'm back home from hanging out and jerking around on my computer. As I wake up I wonder if I would be feeling better if I spread out a few of those bags for later in the week. Got out of bed a little bit before 1PM and parachuted 5-7 grams of Kratom. God it's awful when one of the toilet paper parachutes ruptures before it goes down. Turned that one into a toss and wash. From there I washed it down with a little OJ, coffee, and water. Scrambled up some eggs and mixed it with some crackers to add carbs to it.

Nearly an hour later, I'm not sure if I feel different. I've considered calling out from work but it's a 5 hour shift and the money goes towards my next pay check and we all know what that can be put towards. We'll see, I'll make a decision closer to the start of my shift. I never call out so I think the team can take a hit being down a man even though it typically goes against my ethics.

&nbsp;

######**ROAs for Kratom:**

* Parachuting inside a square of toilet paper

* Tea - most advise drinking the grinds/left over powder. I wish it wasn't necessary but I'm inclined to agree. The tea on it's own isn't too bad. 

I'd consider drinking the grinds to be analogous to drinking tea leaves but folks argue that you're not giving yourself all of the alkaloids if you don't.

* Mix with coffee - this has been ill advised. It was sort of okay.

* Mix with orange juice - haven't tried it yet. I'm afraid to ruin OJ.

* Mix with pudding - I don't have pudding but this is an interesting one. Guess I could do the same with eggs but I'd hate to gag.

&nbsp;

I'm posting here because I'm confident that this is the best place to get advice on using Kratom for opiate withdrawals. I don't have lope but if I did I would agree that it would be a good idea to consume. I have one xanax football that I'll probably save for bed time and even then will break it in half. 

It's been an hour and I still feel pretty shitty. I'm gonna walk around the house, feed the turtles, and see if moving around helps. I've heard energy drinks help with Kratom and I found a deli that sells them for 2 bux each even that's on my way to work.

**If anyone has suggestions on how to best use Kratom to dampen or reduce opiate withdrawals, I'm all ears.**

_________________________________

**Update:**

Found some pro-biotic capsules that I have no use for so I ripped them open and discarded their contents. Then of course, replaced the contents with Kratom. I feel better than I did on preceding days. 

&nbsp;

I appreciate all the suggestions and answers provided by respondents. One of the most novel and potentially favorite ideas involved using honey to make turd nuggets of Kratom. Hopefully I can use Manuka honey because that's all I've got. Also ate a teaspoon of it already just because it's never hurts to eat some honey for nutritional purposes. 

&nbsp;

Really don't know if the Kratom is helping but today I set out not to take too much just because of the ceiling effect. Of course I'll likely take more in a few hours. Just can't tell if it's working right now. My last dose of opiates was Tuesday night and that was half a roxy 30. Hopefully I'll be close to my perky self by tomorrow when I go to work. 

At present my favorite ROA is the capsule form.  I also like the protein shake method, it I certainly didn't taste too bad when mixed with chocolate milk.",1496946199.0

Background :

I ve been using codeine 2-3/week recreationally for the past 6months (600mg to 1,2g) +1Cetirizine pill.  Yes, i ve read about the supposed ceilling effect but i clearly feel the difference.. 
I get effects in 3 stages : 1st hour to 3d light-mild euphoria / 3 to 6th : mild feeling of bliss / 6 to 12  : tired and falling asleep.
I m writing about this because it seems the way you re metabolizing (morphine+?) is different for everyone..and im afraid that with longer effects..the longer the withdrawals..


The Problem :

I get some mild wd symptoms as cramps, flu/sick feeling, diarrhea, cold/hot/sweating from +24h to day 4-5 and after i start feeling WELL. I sleep almost normally during those 5 days.
BUT then starts another physical reaction : Restless legs (at sleeping times) and the insomnia that goes with it. It is even more than restless legs , restless body (hands, shoulders..) like my muscles tense and want to leave my bones..

I get 0 to 2 hours of sleep per night. It drives me crazy. it makes me feel down, irritable, no energy and going nuts..For the moment i ve handled 3 days like that before taking codeine to get some sleep. i ve tried quinine, vit+min , phenibut , loperamide(6mg i had only). None of them really helped.

I will go for holidays in my home country at the end of the month with no access to codeine and dont want to ruin my holidays - i prefer to take action now.

Has anybody had a similar experience?
If someone can help, would be nice - any advice are welcome -( kratom is not an option)

How long does this rls/insomnia lasts ? 

should i consider tapering ?  -i dont know if i have enough time in 20 days; i took yesterday 900mg after 6 days of not taking:( -


******


I would like to add that these doses are high, related to my tolerance and not a reference (could be dangerous, even deadly)!
Personnaly, i started with 150mg with some opioid tolerence. 
On the internet, it is generally considered that 50mg is the safest dose for recreational usage.


I quote erowid :

The LD50 (lethal dose for %50) is 800 mg in the average person. (...) Some sources indicate that the lower-end LD50 may be around 500 mg, so doses above 450 mg are in the red zone.

[Erowid Note: We believe the LD50 data listed above is based on a single paper which reported a human death at 12 mg/kg. Unfortunately the route of administration for this death was not listed. Without this information, the report is basically meaningless. Estimating an LD50 in humans is nearly impossible as LD50 data cannot be directly interpreted between humans and other species. Known oral LD50s for codeine sulphate are: 430 mg/kg in rats and 395 mg/kg in mice. Oral LD50s for codeine phosphate include: 266 mg/kg in rats, 237 mg/kg in mice, and 100 mg/kg in rabbits. It should be remembered that a dose which can be easily tolerated by someone with a significate opiate tolerance could kill an individual with no tolerance.] 

Besides the risk of opiate overdose, there is a risk of anaphylaxis (which can also have deadly consequences).

I've been on methadone for the last half a year or so. When I started, it brought my already infrequent BM's to a grinding halt. Literally would shit once a week if I was lucky. It has gotten so bad that I've had to stick a finger up my poop chute and fish a couple terds out every now and again to make sure I don't get completely blocked up. 

So today I wake up, excited there's a feeling of urgency to go take a shit. Try shitting, struggle for a bit.. nothing's coming out.  Try to go fishing for terds...nothings biting. Finally, a small piece comes out. I wipe. Dark red blood on tp. Look down to see that there's a terd that's composed mainly of blood (and not streaks of blood on it, there was a decent amount blood that had dried and formed with the stool). 



Now I'm laying on my bed, terrified to take a shit. 


Edit: finally got stuff moving again.  Had to take a handful of different things including 20 mg of flexiril and a laxative. Easily took the biggest, most painful shit just about 10 minutes ago. Probably have a fissure from it.

I have had scattered stints of sobriety throughout though, most notably 3 different 2-5 month periods throughout 2016 and 17, with brief but usually hardcore relapses peppered in.  I was in love with just heroin for the longest time.  First 2 years of my use, I just snorted it.  I quickly developed a wicked habit within 6-9 months after first use.  Then, my next great love came in the form of hypodermic needles.  Someone taught me how to shoot myself up, and I never went back. This new route of administration excited the shit out of me.  In my years of doing heroin my goal of every use was to chase a high that was becoming ever more elusive, but now I was introduced to my next great chase: the rush. 

Alas, later that year I was yet again introduced to something that would give me a thrilling new rush: crack cocaine. Fast forward a couple more years and several stretches of sobriety.  During a relapse, I always insist on finding a dealer that can sell me both of my loves: rocks & blows.  I explain why the combination thrills me so much with an analogy that perfectly describes the feeling I get when I use one without the other for extended periods of time.  I say that just doing heroin by itself for too log can become too much, rather like eating nothing but sickly sweet chocolate. Sometimes, you start to crave something salty.  

I have just had a serious bender all day and night with my girl and a friend I made in rehab.  At the end of the night, all I can think about is how crazy addictive and powerfully fucked up shooting speedballs really is.  The combination of heroin's severe potential for long term physical addiction combined with crack's powerful and immediate psychological addiction is match made in hell. I come out of it the worse for wares. My arms and neck are often ravaged and bruised with swollen lumps and darkened track marks from careless full or partial missed injections administered with dull, reused needles.  Any and all money I had is now depleted.  But most significantly, I find that I am never defeated and finished enough to begin another serious journey into recovery without a last speedball bender, a bender to end all benders.  

I have been struggling to get clean again after a relapse that has resulted in legal consequences.  However, after doing my last shot a short while ago after a particularly voracious binge, I finally feel like after one last binge tomorrow, I will be thoroughly burned out and ready to get sober again. It's how the eve of all my most successful sobriety dates has gone.  So tomorrow I will shamelessly enjoy my favorite cocktail of hard drugs, knowing that by the end of it, I will be tired.  Tired of being exhausted.  Tired of being broke.  Tired of my head being an absolute mess.  I will wield this weary, defeated feeling in early recovery to combat temptations to relapse.  I will carry the memory of it as a ferocious reminder of the thoroughly exhausting and vicious cycle so much as one bag of dope leads me to.

So fam, i stopped doin oxy and dope and hopped on the Kratom. My boss was my plug and he got transferred far away. I was super bummed at first but it ended up being a blessing in disguise. The first week off sucked. But Kratom helped me more than subs ever have. I was spending my entire paychecks every week on pills and dope. So once I started Kratom, I realized ""shit, I actually have money now...wtf do I do""? So since me and my gf at the time were living with her parents I decided we need our own space. 

So I was clean but my gf of 7 years was still using behind my back. I played dumb but I still knew. So I secretly saved up money for 6ish months and got my own place. Dumped my gf once I signed my lease and up and left. Our relationship was literally toxic. Her parents fuel her drug habit and know it. I couldn't sit there and be apart of it anymore. 

So flash forward to now. Tonight is my first night in my new place and a girl I work with, who sweats me badddd and is wayyyyyyyyyy sexier than my ex came over with a housewarming gift. 5 perk 30s. I didn't even know this girl fucked around like that!!!!! She's never mentioned it once nor have I. My jaw hit the floor. I've been clean for a good chunk of time but this girls too fuckin hot to say no too. So we blew 2.5 each and fucked for soooooo longggggg. Best sex I've ever had hands down.

I am a daily opiate addict, I use once per day, usually in the night, when I get back home from work, and after I can sleep till the other day, I am doing fine with this schedule for abou 4 months, and I never take it more than once a day ( i will go broke on money if I do that ). 

Anyway, my tolerance to opiates range from 20-30mg oxy with 120-150mg of morphine sulfate plugged, I always do this combo, as I think its a fucking great combo. I sometimes can get some methadone, and use it too, dose of 30-35mg. I already did a lot of drugs, I passed benzos, barbiturates, cocaine, amphs, weed, and nowadays my daily usage limit to tobacco, weed, opiates, antihistamines. I always took my opi dose with 25-50mg of prometh or hidroxizine. I already did a lot of combos too, very experienced with opi + benzos, and a lot of times i put cocaine in the mix, I love it :3 

Anyways, tomorrow I will go to my new girl house, and it will be my first time with her in a place we can be alone, so will gonna have sex. I am diagnosed with GAD, and I have a lot of anxiety issues with new girls, with my ex girlfriend, I started doing sex with her, and a lot of times (the first ones) i couldnt get hard after sometime, because of my anxiety problems, until I got used to it, and never had more problems. I was prescribed xanax before, but when i start taking opiates, i stopped doing it, and stopped going to my doc too. I didnt tell my new girl about my anxiety problems, and I doesnt wanna to talk about it, I dont wanna loose her, since she is perfect for me, and for the first time, I want to do it right, I dont want to fuck it up with her. 

So I am thinking (she dont know about my opi addiction too, in my country opi addiction almost not exist) and she wouldn discover by herself, here preconception reigns about abusing pharms. I have a bunch of pharms in my stash right now, and I want to know. I am thinking in dosing my normal opiate dose 20mg of oxy + 120mg morph, with 25mg of prometh/hidroxizine, and put in the top 1mg of xanax to try to combat my anxiety, and some friend of mine gave me a 50mg viagra pill, I never used it, never had any experience with this, but do u guys think is a good idea to take a viagra in the mix? I will dose my minimum dose of opis, just to not WD, the benzo will help my anxiety, and I think the viagra can make me do a good sex all night long. Should I do that?

Last time I snorted some..same thing ..1mg or a little less.. around 7am this morning.

When should I been able to take and feel any of those..

Mainly curious because
A. Over the last week dose has been so small.
B. Snorting them was curious if that lowers the half life like it does with most snorted opiates.

Someone I work that is on sub told me 24 hours but then when I told him about snorting the Subutex he said I may have to wait longer cause 'tex has stronger blocking power? 

So yea he kinda added to my confusion more than anything hoping someone here could help.

I got some stamps from a guy i had never dealt with before (he's legit though, many people go through him) in nyc (brooklyn) and after doing like 2 buns, i noticed that the stuff was really clogging up my nose.  When i would blow my nose, the boogs were the color red and it was very clear that something was up.  

If i used a lot the night before going to sleep, waking up in the morning i would have a very clogged nose and it would be dried to the side of my nostrils and it would hurt like fuck to pull it off with my hands because it would take my nose hairs with it.  But when i blew my nose really hard, it was almost like huge chunks came out, sometime a couple centimeters long.  it almost looked like a chunk of skin came off, but i dont think it was.  it was flat and stained red obviously but it didnt feel like i was ripping off skin or anything, it very well could have just been dried up chunks.  

So for the next 2 weeks my nose hurt slightly when i push on it.  There was a night about 4 days after the initial bloody snot when my right nostril starting actually bleeding like a nosebleed, and after using only my left for a couple hours later letting my right one heel with tissue stuffed up there, the left one started to bleed too.  I had one more night with a nosebleed in each nostril a couple days later.  

So i tried to be a little more careful the next couple days after the nosebleeds, and it still hurt kinda when pushed hard and i would have bloody snot.  I started using a sinus rinse bottle with only warm water (is that bad?) to wash out the stuff at the end of the night.  The past couple days it seems to have completely healed and no more bloody snot at all.  

My question is, what possibly could have caused a nosebleed in both nostrils at the same time?  I could see it being long term damage, but why would it have started with both nostrils on the same day?  Surely they would go at different times.  

Could this have been an infection?  My nose feels 100% fine now.  
Here are my theories:

* there was some sort of abrasive cut in the stuff i got and it caused both nostrils to be cut up.  Perhaps when it dried up it caused some sort of damage to my inner nose and possibly dried it out due to lack of air.  Does anyone know of any cuts that are common and cause this kind of effect?  Keep in mind that it was only bloody snot (but very consistent bloody snot, but no dripping blood other than the two short times when it bled once until dry and scabbed)

* It's possible I gave myself a paper cut using the crisp dollar bill I rolled up, and got it in both nostrils


So if anyone has any experience with this sort of thing, where both nostrils were simultaneously damaged and there were constantly large dried clumps of bloody boog stuff when blowing nose.  Interested in hearing what you guys think",1497028687.0

Who only looks pretty in a certain light, who only looks beautiful when she smiles a certain way. She's the type of girl your friends tell you is good for you.  The one who won't cheat on you. Scream at you. The girl who could bring you back to earth. She's always there, has never lied to you. She would devote herself to you completely if you let her. 

But I can't seem to love her the way I love heroin. Heroin is the girl who lies to tell you what you want to hear. The one you undress with your eyes whenever you see her. She's the girl who makes you rip your hair out in a fit. A fit she instigated. Shell dull the roar in your head with her sweet voice.  Until she leaves. And everything is louder than ever. She cheats on you. Abuses and uses you. And let's you do the same to her. She's poison to your soul. And she'll never turn you away. 

And no one understands why she's always your first choice.",1497024500.0
