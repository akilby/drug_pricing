I went through a hard time and he stuck by me, but for the last year it's been hard to stick by him. I'm in love with someone who doesn't exist anymore. He starts with just trying things, which I understand. You want to try Coke you want to try molly you want to try acid. But that's different than addiction. He's addicted to opiates and he mixes them with xanax, adderall, and different opiates at the same time. I walk into his house seeing him pasted out and each time I think OD. He's gotten in a lot of trouble over the past few months, citations, dui, jail. Hes spent thousands of dollars in only a couple days. He's On edge with his family, me, his friends. And nothing hits him that he needs to stop, I know he has to want to in order for him to quit. It would be different if he was just trying things. But he's messing up his life. He doesn't go to his job, doesn't contact his family or friends. Only does drugs and continues to fuck up things. He can't function through out the day and needs to be on a multiple drugs everyday.

I just want to get help for my problems and become normal and a productive person and I want to take care of my girlfriend. I don't choose to be this way, if I could just get scripts of benzos like I have in the past, the doctors would cut out the bullshit anti depressant shit and save the bullshit and give medicine to combat my anxiety, my life would change and it would change for the better but because I have to come out as an addict to one doctor for subs (I will NOT stop shooting drugs unless I am maintained. I can't) will they just give me the run around and tell me to man up and shit and explain why I am not allowed to be prescribed benzos? I'm sorry for the wall of text but if anyone takes the time to read this and perhaps give me on advice on going about getting my panic attacks and anxiety etc under control you would literally be helping to save a life.

I have never been able to be talked down or anything, this is a huge problem and I'm not joking even a little bit. I feel as though if a case as severe as mine isn't treated with medication I'm going to look like a lazy pile of shit and have to live a miserable fucking life because for some reason I'm so fucked up in the head that I get crippled with anxiety and panic attacks constantly.

Today was with a friend in Orlando at a wawa pumping his chest and blowing my life into a fucking virtual stranger I've known for a month. Met thru a place we all know on reddit but do not speak of freely  

It was noon and we had just got two bags of some very fire heroin. 2 rocks I had to smash into powder. So I loaded my shot it was big. The rush was strong. I decided my buddies amount and poured it into the blue cap he slide on my lap. Add water.. Cotton... Done this a billion times he says ""a small shot today? That's cool"" I was offended .. Feeling guilty I poured him another shot that was bigger, since his rush was ""little"" cant cheat my buddy who drove me ya know? He pushes down... And something is wrong . I look over trying to grab a water bottle from his lap and his jaw was jittering. His eyes fucking white... As soon as I'm starting to figure it out his lips go blue and he stops breathing... In a packed parking lot. Thank god we didn't park up front.. I'm dragging him across the central console screaming his name. I'm petrified this kid is fresh from rehab.. Which I was not happy bout but I found out after wards. I dont like helping people relapse.


I can't move him. His so big and dead... Weight....god the pun.  Well fuck I put the seat back and start breathing in his mouth pumping his chest. It seemed like a year. A year breathing my life into his lifeless body. His eyes.. His eyes were the worst part I saw no life. He starts breathing again but its weak and his heart beat is maybe 25 bpm . I can't call the police this is Florida they will ruin my and his life's. I call my wife as I drag him to the passenger seat. His color is returning. He's makes some kind of Lead way. I splash him with water he groans and starts to mumble .I start screaming for him to please just wake up! He opens his eyes and is dazed. He asks what is going on. I explain our current situation. He says no way. I got so mad. He was just dead. And had the audacity to say no way. I hugged him and held his hand later to concrete what had just happened and to make sure he was alive and I wasn't dreaming it.  He will read this and I want him to know I love you bro. Im just happy youre ok.. Thanks for the read guys. !!!!!!!And understand how shitty it is that laws in Florida prevent people from calling 911 for overdoses as cops come with the EMTs. Not too mention we have no access to narcan its bullshit!!!!!!! Edit we have laws on the books but the police e will still charge you and narcan is never prescribed.

been a while since i submitted a post. I've been in pain management for a few years now. I'm on fentanyl transderman 50mcg/hr every 2 days, and oxy for breakthrough pain.  i also use nicotine, I used to be a smoker but now I just use snus because my lungs are fucked up. 

I get intense nicotine cravings, so I usually have snus in my mouth. but it seems to stop my pain relief in its tracks. you'd think the cravings for opiates and pain relief would trump the nicoine craving, but i find myself even using it subconsciously and not remembering when i put one in when i notice pain coming back. does anyone else find that ciggs/nicotine or something else kills the effect of their opiates or opioids? even alcohol does the same thing to me, but that was super easy to not use. does it really come down to just having to quit tobacco products to stop wasting my pain killers, or maybe something else is going on?

any feedback or advice is welcome, i really would like to resolve this but i'm also not sure if i should be looking elsewhere for the cause of this decline. i had done coke and oxy speedballs in college  before i got sick and that never seemed to stop both from working, so i don't think it is a stimulant thing in general, but i had also heard from others that nicotine boosts their DOC.

These 20mg pills are insanely powerful and last all day.  I've been using the Coca-Cola soak method to make them more instant-release...not sure if that's working but I'm definitely high.  I just sip the coke gradually throughout the day for a nice buzz.  The pills are the 'OP' version, not the infamous 'OC' ones.  But IDGAF.  They were cheap and beat the hell out of the crappy codeine I was taking.  

This is officially the most potent opioid I've tried.  Others include codeine, poppy pods, hydrocodone, tramadol, kratom, tianeptine & dihydrocodeine.  I guess I'd say Oxy is most similar to poppy pods, which also last all day.  But it's more euphoric whereas pods are more heavy and sedating.  I dislike the ""nods"" and just want the mood boost provided by the semi-synthetics like hydro and oxy.  

Note:  It's a good thing I don't have steady access to these or I'd be in trouble.  They're a fun once-in-a-blue moon treat though.  My doctor recently Rx'ed me 30 hydrocodone 7.5's too, so I'm swimming in opiates right now.  (Well, for a fair-weather user like myself anyway).

How do you guys like to prepare and use your Oxy?  What doses do you require to get high?  How does it compare to heroin?  Which would you take if you could have an unlimited supply of either H or Oxy?

Now, as an inexperienced IV-er...I had my friend do it for me. He was always able to draw blood back up and deliver a successful shot, in less than 5 or so tries (give or take). This is because my veins are RIDICULOUSLY tiny, they're all fresh veins so that's not the issue. He would always have to shoot me in the hands to get the shot in, nowhere else my veins would appear (even after tying off or running under hot water/showering). Here's my dilemma, that ""friend"" that shot me up is someone I'm no longer speaking to, he turned out being the biggest fiend who was robbing me and my boyfriend of 50$ worth of dope each time we rode out with him to cop. So, now that we are no longer speaking to him...shooting up is extremely challenging for me. Yesterday I had my other friend try it, he managed to get it in my wrist...but alas the vein moved and half of it went in the vein and half of it just went somewhere into my arm (resulting in my wrist swelling up insanely). After that when I wanted another shot, my friend poked me about 40 times (probably more) trying to get it into a vein and have blood register (I even showered in hopes of making my veins show up and they DID show up but as he was shooting it he was hitting exactly where you could see the vein under the skin but the blood STILL wasn't registering). I know I have super small veins (I've been told this at numerous hospital visits for unrelated events), I've been told my veins are shy and they move from the needle. I'm at a loss of what to do, I gave up on that shot after about 40 pokes yesterday and just copped more and snorted it to get myself high. Please help me, my veins are such a pain in the ass and I've seemingly tried EVERYTHING. I mean I CAN snort it, but I miss that rush terribly. I've even tried it myself and can't seem to get blood to draw back up. Any suggestions or ideas would me much appreciated, thanks in advance guys.

(Help me; Harm Reduction),"Its been 10 or 11 days. The pink cloud is fading, and I've failed to get back on my prescription meds in time. These once forgotten feelings of depression and anxiety are assaulting the entrance of my keep with the force of an orcish army. Deep through my bones march this constant thrumming pain, my joints creak with every movement. 
I'm only 22 years old. I feel like I'm 80. 

Straight to the point: when I was using I would require 0.15g at the least of the shit I was getting to not be sick for 24~ hours. Turns out this shit was pure sugar and fentanyl, as I did the same dose, 0.15g, of the ""fire"" from my hometown a couple weeks ago while in day 2 of WD and I felt nothing. Took away my sickness for maybe 6 hours and not even completely I was still left with pain and restless legs. 
The reason I bring this up being... I'm about to fall off the wagon. I'm going to end up shooting up today and I know this. I've been fighting these voices for 2 days now and they are getting louder, and louder, with no hope of cessation. I'm only planning on doing a point of the shit from my hometown, that's where I'm at right now, but I at least need a clear answer to a question or two I have. I just need to know, no matter what ultimately happens. 

I know everyone's chemistry is different and effects will vary, but let's say out of 70% of a group that is 10 days clean of heroin/fentanyl, how many of these subjects MAY experience withdrawal symptoms after coming down from just one single hit. 
How might these symptoms compare to the withdrawals of an avid everyday user.
And,
Purely speculative as I know there is no way to know for certain until I try it, 
In each of your own personal opinions, how high (if at all, I was no longer getting high off opiates at the time I quit. Just a rush and it was gone. No longer sick, no longer miserable, but not ""High"") can I possibly expect to get from a point of something that would have previously been akin to shooting water, basically.

He's been to rehab 3 times but always relapses admitting that he gets bored being sober. We both still live at home and he has a job which has enabled his continuing purchasing of the product. He recently got a girlfriend which initially seemed like a positive influence on his situation but his relationship has become very stressful as he frequently argues with his girlfriend often outright starting shouting matches with her at our home which has been addressed. I believe he uses more than before to escape the stress created by this toxic relationship. He's gotten more careless about concealing his usage by having his connect deliver at outside our home and using in the bathroom where he nods off for up to an hour or more and the always present thuds of him dropping his e cig during these times. I often see some left over ash in the area and sometimes the tools used such as rolled up papers with the dark stains from the smoke.

I'm currently at a loss of how to have an influence on him to steer towards quitting. I've been told and have read that he has to decide that for himself which I can understand but what if he decides to keep using? Do I just ""wait,"" for him to decide for another 5 years? How long can someone continue to use black tar heroin before they reach the point of no return? How's he been able to use off and on for 5 years? Can you really dose low enough to prevent overdoses for such a long period of time? Does his access to subutex allow this continued use? I feel concerned not having Naloxone in the event that he does overdose, is that a legitimate thing to worry about?

The one thing I feel I haven't tried that could work is to use a dramatic example to shake him out of his apathy. By completely changing my own life around for the better maybe he would be inspired to do the same for himself. I'm focusing on his problem in this post but I'm far from perfect myself, I gave up on my career choice, am jobless and am very apathetic in achieving my everyday goals. Thinking about it sometimes makes me feel he's justified in escaping the reality I continue to create around him but I've been told it's not my fault, I just can't help but feel it really is in someway. Say I become very successful in most aspects of my life, wouldn't that be a very strong reason to inspire him to do the same? If I could offer him financial and personal freedom at only the cost of his sobriety as an incentive, wouldn't that overcome his long standing reason of relapsing, boredom?

I have been heavily addicted to oxy since about this time last year, in November I bought heroin for the first time. I also got hooked on benzos during the Winter period which I posted about priorly and managed  to stop with the aid of my doctor. But also with the aid of more heroin and oxy - I'd say I've been snorting H n.4 nearly every day since early January as well as popping pills.

Before I picked up opiates  I was an amphetamine addict (2 years ago), a habit that nearly killed me.

I now find myself in 1st year of university for the 3rd time (the first been blighted by depression, the second by addiction, and last year I took the year out to work full-time, and my opiate addiction spiralled out of control).

There's a lot of shame and secrecy attached to my drug use and until Friday night I had never even come close to revealing the full extent of my issues with anyone.

As mentioned, I progressed to heroin and have been using it almost daily since the beginning of January (only ever snorted). **My parents caught me in the act and now this is all out in the open.** They are understandably very distraught, angry and ashamed. They aren't convinced I want to change, which is understandable. **However I see this as an opportunity to quit now that I am not struggling in silence any more.**

They searched my room, seized my phone, my cash etc. However they didn't find the 10 valiums, 5 OC 40s, and 6 x 50mg lyrica (the latter I stole from a relative - my only connect for lyrica is out of the country.) **I have been secretly tapering down with the oxy (i took my last half a pill today) but have avoided using the valium and lyrica. I have been feeling fairly shitty but the physical WDS have mostly been non-existent.**

Now however, **I am facing withdrawals** which is a scary prospect but something I have to do. **As far as my parents are concerned I've quit cold turkey, my mum is refusing to buy me fricking immodium or pay for any treatment** (not referring to rehab, rather any medication a doc might prescribe). Obviously she's disgusted, horrified, in shock.  I can't really blame her for not knowing anything about heroin/opiate withdrawals. **They think I've gone 48 hours and the worst is over.**

I am going to an addiction support group tomorrow night and have been in touch with NA. But **I need medical support, (I don't want to go on bupe) and in my experience lyrica is very helpful. I want to know what I should say to my doctor? What should I request and should I state outright what I think would be helpful?** Usually I never suggest specific meds for fear of seeming drug-seeking but naturally this situation is different.

**What is the best regimen of meds to request for withdrawals? And how long will it take to feel normal again given my duration of opiate abuse? (80mgs of Oxy a day since Feb 2015 to August 2015, 40-80mgs most days from late Sept till present, Began snorting H N.3 in November 2015 and H n.4 every day since January 2016)**",1455719231.0

Supposedly, there is heroin #4, called ""Thai"" in Athens, which is white and indeed doesn't need any citric acid for people that shoot. However, it's always cut to the heavens -- not worth it at all. With horrible and weird withdrawals, too. 

*Okay, lets forget about that ""thai"" bullshit, and let's talk Heroin #3:*

Always customers were asking dealers whether their product was ""dope with legs or dope with rush?"". 

Product with the combo of both a strong rush **and** long legs, is something like an Opiate Unicorn that magically shits Heroin through its Horn here... I've only found such a thing twice in my heroin life which is now ~10 years. And those dealers are always arrested quickly due to jealousy from others, who snitch them. This is pathetic and a very Balkan behaviour...

However something that happened lately has got me thinking, and I am by no means a chemist -- I'm just a singer/songwriter:

Lately the Romas, where I go to do my ""shopping"", openly say that they have ""two kinds of gear"". One with the legs, and one with the rush but no duration. That thing was never explicitly stated by dealers, let alone having both kinds and having the customer select one of the two. But the last month, they started having the aforementioned 2 kinds of gear.

The rushy one costs 10$ per gram, and the long legs one, costs 15$ per gram. My selection is always the rushy one, not because it's cheaper, but because we all know that pure/quality Heroin #3, is not a product that is meant to last long. 

Good heroin has a short half-life with a strong rush, due to the fact that it is being metabolized VERY quickly into Morphine by our bodies.

If anything, Morphine is the one which is more noddy and slowly but steadily makes us high, with a longer duration/""legs"" indeed.

**Now, my theory:**

I think that the ""long legs heroin"" product must contain many Morphine impurities, as in, the product was not fully transformed into Diacetyl-o-morphine (aka heroin) during the acetyl process. That means that the product might have a significant percentage of Morphine in it, together with Heroin.

I've tried to explain it to many greek friends of mine who are also addicts, but people here prefer urban myths, than a opinion formed after research. To give you a picture, there are still addicts that think that Heroin is produced in Turkey and Albania, and that the cutting agent is fish food, strychnine, and rat poison -.-

(i love my country but I hate the balkan state of mind, or lack thereof)

------------------------------------------------------

**What do you think, and most interestingly, which is theoretically YOUR favorite kind of gear? A short-lived one but with a huge rush, OR a long-lived one with a steadily rising rush (or not rush at all) ?**

Thanks for reading this wall of text, and I'm sorry for mistakes in the English language, as always, I remind people that I'm greek so... it's not my mother tongue.

So I go through this cycle of trying to get on subs and give up after 2 days of mental struggle and cop at midnight when I know I won't find anything for another 8 hours. I'm sure many of you know that feeling. 

The problem is, I'm confused about how subs works with my body. I have had good and bad experiences, on a good day, which is about 60%+ of the time, I take them and I feel completely okay, even a little buzz with respiratory depression, I peak from hour 2-6, and have to dose again after 12. Somedays they even work almost immediately. I can get thru WD period like this no problem. 

But then other days, about 35% of my sub inductions end with me feeling pretty uncomfortable no matter how many times I redose. I may feel a little better for 30 min after each dose but it goes away after only a few hours. I still have aches and that sense of dread, and these are the days that I give up and cop. 

But even when I cop after this happens, which is what I did today, I can't shake some of the aches and anxiety even after 5 stamps. I don't really have too much trouble feeling it after taking subs since I rarely ever exceed a whole 8 in one day. I do feel better, but not like how I'd normally feel on the same amount. What I'm saying is the sickness won't fully go away. 

Then there's the last 5% where I get PWD. It's only happened less than 5 times and each time I caved in, but I know it goes away after about 40 min since usually I'm alright by the time I get that ECP in my hands. Not fully recovered, but alright. The shakes, sweating, panic attacks, RLS would stop and leave me exhausted. At least I don't vomit or shit myself during PWD. Yet. 

I wanna ask you guys if anyone have the same problem with subs? It's almost like my result each time depends on my luck that day, no guarantee how well it will work and I only get to find out after I dose. Why does it have such inconsistent effects? I can feel fine and dandy after 2mg on some days but be rubbing my arms and legs in bed on 8mg other days. Whyyyyy?

You do not ""bring somebody back to life"" by performing CPR.  you cannot ""restart a heart"" by performing CPR.  You did not ""watch somebody die"" and then come back to life.  When the heart is stopped, completely stopped, it is game over.  You cannot shock a flatline and resuscitate a person.  Please, stop pretending what you saw on a medical drama is something you did

When I've seen people talk about the possibility of doing this, they mention the heat of vaporization of heroin base and heroin salts, but I think they're barking up the wrong tree. I think the vape works more by atomization than vaporization, and that most of the actual vapor phase product is water. Think about it - if the vapor was actually getting heated up to 200+ degrees, it would burn your mouth every time you inhale. Or, alternatively, if it was getting that hot but then losing heat energy by the time it got to you, it would condense again. I think what's actually going on is that atomized liquid glycerin/propylene glycol containing the drug is what's getting into your lungs - can anyone confirm or deny this?

Anyway, vaporizing heroin dissolved in glycerin definitely works. I added 2-3 drops of water when I was mixing it up too. Has anyone else tried this?",1455692476.0

I will soon graduate with a chemistry degree. Never used opiates, never plan to. But it seems like the heroin userbase of this sub is very worried with two things:

-adulterants (i.e. heroin cut with, or replaced by, fentanyl)

-Not easily being able to check strength

With that in mind, in the interest of harm reduction, would you regularly use a device that would separate heroin from other opiates? It would probably have to be specific - i.e. separating heroin from fentanyl, instead of generally purifying heroin from whatever. From there, you would come out with the same concentration of heroin each time. Both of those seem like they'd make it less likely to OD. 

Does this already exist? Would you ever use something like that in the interest of safety? Am I totally off base here? Let a noob know.",1455691177.0

Went to clean up my mess and what do you know, there's a little yellow pill covered in dust just under the fridge. My grandma must have dropped it so I asked if she was missing one to which she said no. I happily chewed it up and was in a better mood.

Few hours go by, nothing's really going on so the hour ride to the city and dope man sound like a good idea. I really just wanted to get out of the house. The two bags I was planning on getting was just the icing on the cake. The car is somewhat legal I guess. Insured and inspected, just no sticker. Made my way down the highway trying not to speed as to avoid any reason to get pulled over. You know how it goes. A ticket would be no bueno por caca.

Get to the spot, dope man asks me how much I have to spend, tell him $25. He  walks around the side of the abandoned house across the street from his to his stash. Comes back around and to the car and hands me a sandwich baggie. ""Here you go HinTX, it's a half gram. I know you got a long ass ride to get down here."" Hell yeah! A half g for $25? I'll take that any day of the week. Fix me up a small shot so I'll feel good for the ride back. Shit isn't as good as last week but it's decent.

my grandmother is diabetic and we share her source of rigs and i get them to fill in the blanks, she doesn't mind keeping my arms intact and she was already reusing her rigs a couple times, so it all works out for everyone.

earlier today i had cleaned out some rigs i had sitting around, i wasn't feeling well, it was like 4 am, i don't drive so i can't just go grab them, so i did the next best thing and busted out the bleach.

 i triple rinse with water, some amount between 6-10 bleach rinses per rig, all the way up, shake, all the way out, fresh bleach, rinse ( ;) ) and repeat, then i do roughly the same or more amount of water, i then change water for a final rinse and then clean my plunger

 not positive if i'm doing it perfect but honestly its good enough, i've done some stupid shit and feel like not knotting my arms up is smarter even if i end up with a blood infection or something. (already have hep) 

anyways around to the only important part here, as soon as i registered BAM, bleach smell, i had bleach around still, coulda been random, but i'm more sure that i had gotten some crazy small amount in the rig, I tried to look it up and didn't find any information i was really satisfied with so i figured i'd come here and see if anyone KNEW what happens to the veins and body with extremely diluted bleach being injected?

i experienced no noticable issues other then the same, no burn or anything, and i've been more careful to make sure my water was clean, so hopefully it won't  happen again, but i still feel like this is an area that might need a little talking about since the most common way to clean a rig is with bleach,

Y'know, stuff that pisses you off but doesn't harm or kill you.

-=[poop alert]=-

Constipation is obviously a big one. I haven't been using all that much recently, so usually after a few days of not using my bowels revert to trying to push poop out of me. It'd been a couple of days and a few heavy meals when that log made of razors started to make its way through my system. The first few are usually the hardest, but tend to be rabbit pellets. It's usually the second or third one that has the most mass and solidarity. I'd had a few rabbit poops last night, but was awoken this morning with the beast knocking. I hobbled to the toilet, ignoring the stabbing pains traveling up through my lower intestines, and sat on the toilet. Usually I'd put a few bits paper on the surface to get the most of the splashback, but this one was coming before my ass was fully on the seat. It actually wasn't bad at first, but then I started to feel that ""oh god it's not gonna fit"" feeling. It was a painful, but thankfully relatively quick experience. I strained a camel through the needle that was my asshole, which was enough for me, but then the splashback, with dead accuracy, goes halfway up my recently evacuated gaping rectum. Not a little splash on the anus, I'm talking dirty toilet water caressing my prostate. Fuck. That.

I'm sure you guys have much worse poop stories, I've even read a few, but god I hate that feeling of toilet water in your ass.

He obliged but only took one. It was a damn good day. I forgot how much I missed uppers. I had a few gel Fentanyl patches in my pocket all day and only took one baby hit about the size of a BB of the foil while I was on lunch. I really didn't feel like I was withdrawing at all besides the fact that had to drop what I was doing and sprint to the bathroom two or three times. I might begin to use uppers as a way of getting through the worst of the withdrawals. 

   So now that I've exhausted all of my possible entertainment for the night. I'm here with my foil and my patches. Smoking like a fucking champ, still slightly geeked. I also managed to get a phone call and a date from my Gorgeous ex-girlfriend that has hated me ever since I left her for basically no reason other than the fact that I'm not able to keep myself in a relationship for some reason.

He doesn't often say lthat but maybe once a month even though he picks up a couple times a week. We heed his warning and make our shots smaller than the usual.

Did another shot a couple hours ago of equal size and same shit everything itches and is really warm. This time the soles of my feet burn and itch terribly. This never lasts more than a couple minutes, but those couple minutes are filled with burning, itching  pain. Obviously, it wasnt just one weird shot it must be the batch.

My wife and I even had weird splotches pop up. Raised skin in random spots kinda white mainly red because of the heat. Like it looks like small burns. Or like allergic reaction but there's nothing both of us are allergic to as far as I know. And everything clears up after about 5 minutes maybe 15.

Just wondering if this has ever happened to anyone else. It is definitely something it was cut with but I can't imagine what it could be. Any ideas?

I hope this post finds y'all well and exactly where you want to be with who you want to be with! This is a new username but I was a regular poster and commentator on this forum until a tad bit shy of 5 months ago. I went to rehab for the first time, on my own accord, and did the 28 day stay. I made great friends there who I stayed in contact with upon release. Got into my local recovery scene, got a homegroup, a sponsor, and did over 90 meetings in 90 days. I even finished Step One. Things were great! I felt the best I had felt in 10 years mentally and spiritually. My relationship with my parents and brother were back to pre-addiction level. During active addiction I never stole from my family but I lost their respect, trust, and I wrecked their peace of mind. I was living on my own before rehab and my family allowed me to move back in with them after rehab to get my feet back under me. There was one condition to me being able to stay there...use once & I'm kicked out. I relapsed today, it was blatantly obvious I was high on opiates. Those damn pinned pupils will give you away everytime!!! So, now I'm not sure what to do. My granpaw is currently in a nursing home, soon to be released, and I have a key to his house. So that's where I'm sleeping tonight. But, fuck man I don't know what to do or what will happen next. I'm still trying to wrap my head around why I even copped and used today. I wasn't facing any stressful situations or nasty emotions. It was the first time I thought about getting high in 3 weeks and I just caved in. Sorry for such a long post I'm just high as fuck, full of regret, and stressed about what to do next. Maybe this can be an example or help someone who is thinking of relapsing, DON'T DO IT!

And (almost) everyone who commented led back around to how this is impossible and im too cocky? Apparently? And how I think I'm invincible and I'm probly already addicted. Well I'd just like to reiterate  that, going in my first post here with a friendly attitude and being met with spite was kinda sucky. But, its whatever, I'm here now posting to let everyone know that (as I said in last post, been using u-47 somewhat frequently) after being met with almost no positive outlooks on my future I decided to prove that that's bullshit. 

So that day was the last time I dosed u-47 after using it in pretty careful yet somewhat  frequent dosages. I started with a gram, ended on that day with around 400 mg left (still in closet, no real need to use it more after conducting my research). And in the subsequent two or 3 days I only went through minor withdrawals if any, due to my moderation in use of the substance. 

Hopefully this post will go to show that yes, using opiates without becoming an addict or it having real negative impact on you or your life is possible. Even though apparently ""that's how everyone starts out"" and all you guys were ""just like me when ya started then ruined your life with h addiction.""

46bsyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/46bsyc/need_some_methadone_dosing_advice/,8,https://redd.it/46bsyc,JabbaThaSlut,Need some methadone dosing advice.,"Im something of a rare bird when it comes to opiates. Despite what anyone may or may not think about how honest Im being about the subject, Im perfectly capable of using casually. I've used with varying levels of frequency for almost 20 years, but in the last 7 years my usage has been purely recreational, maybe a handful of times a year. The only reason I mention this is because I seem to have something of low level permanent tolerance, probably due in part to the fact that my body never really fully recovers after dosing.

Three or four months ago, I picked up a bag of dope via some kids I met at a needle exchange. For reference, I shot about a bag and a half or so of middling NW tar over the course of about 8 hours and got pretty decently wrecked. 

The kids I was with left four 10mg methadone pills at my house, and I'm thinking about taking some this weekend, but I've heard methadone dosing can be squirrelly.

Since redosing methadone doesn't really do anything, and might even get you into, uh... mortal trouble, Im thinking about taking 15 mils up front to compensate for my general tolerance so I don't waste the shit and have to wait a few days to redose.

Anyone have any similar experience with the stuff? Reading up on it pretty much everyone confirms its like the bucking bronco of opiates. Fuckwithable, but precaution is a must. ",1455752843.0

Started with the IV this past summer, and clearly I wasn't very good at it because sometimes I would get impatient from the inability to register and just blast away hoping I was in.

DO NOT DO THIS. Always register your shots. Three days after the miss my skin started to get a little red. Week later, it became painful and swollen, and warm to the touch. 

Two weeks later, the redness spread throughout the area and it became harder to move my arm. Every day it got worse, and of course being the idiot drug addict that I am, neglected it and just hoped it would go away on its own. Of course it didn't, and when I finally went to the ER, the intake nurse said, ""I can't believe you waited this long to come in. You know you could lose your arm, right?""

The nurse who looked at my arm noticed the marks immediately and asked me how long I've been shooting up. I said only a couple months, which of course elicited a look from her like: Yeah fucking right, dude. 

Anyway, a male nurse came over, put towels under my arm, and lanced/drained the abscess. It hurt like HELL. They gave me dilauded and some pills during my THREE DAY HOSPITAL STAY. Three days! Here's a pic of the scar:

So i set out today to improve my opiate scoring abilities. My day started with me randomly coming across a local hindu spice shop so i went and bought a lb of poppy seeds to see if they were worth anything. Its always a gamble trying new seeds but luck was with me and the seeds were not only cheap but suprisingly potent. Then i managed to get ahold of another using buddy and it looked like i was going to have a nice easy cop. But of course the guy hes going through says he doesnt want to serve me because i was in rehab not long ago. Moral high ground bulllshit. So once again it seems like im searching in vain. As a last ditch effort i message a rehab buddy and this is where the miracle happens. He being a genuinely good guy asks his plug if he can give me the plugs number. Turns out the dude lives ten blocks from my house, so this way i dont have to worry about catching a ride or paying out gas money. Then the dude actually sells so no middle to go through and rip me off. And the cherry on top, the guy sells at a reasonable price, the deal as extremely quick, he doesnt use himself so very professional, has it all the time and the tar was some of the best ive ever had. My day went from hopeless to me having my first real plug that didnt require. So i want to shout out to my buddy Spencer for being so helpful and also thank you guys for the good advice yesterday so that i could hold out for a proper plug. Sorry for the rant but this is like a dream com true and i wanted to share my good fortune. Happy nods yo.",1455856259.0

After on and off 8 month or so tar habit with some subs in there. im hoping to keep cuttng down before kicking in april or before;""(traveling), but thats when ill be leaving current city/job. Habit  was as high as a gram a day of tar(and some crack) and 12mg/day of sub via zubsolv. At the moment hovering around .4g of tar per day and hoping to switch to a non iv opiate. Pks are so expensive, I wonder how much discomfort would I feel making the jump to kratom of some kind? Or tianeptine, or those combined. Currently experimenting and its hard to get well w anything bit tar  Im just worried about veins (p sure have mild phlebitis) and general health from shooting and though not trying to kick immediately, get myself to a less dangerous habit that may be easier to jump from. The subs, despite their benefits, are so strong that i wonder how conducive they are to wanting to be off entirely pretty soon. Also ive been feeling sort of weird getting on them lately, with a day plus of discomfort after taking first dose. Folks say its maybe precepitated withdrawls but I didnt know those could last a day. If i did do kratom or something else a day or two could maybe i go to a super low dose of sub for a little while? Have heard jumping from any amt of sub can be hell so when i do id rather be on kratom oxy or even bth for that matter if its a low dose. Anyone been in similar circumstances? Im tired of the needle but not totally done with getting high, and wondering even i cut my doses way down could i catch a buzz on anything with a tolerance for .4g decent bth per day? Guess the price is what drove me to tar originally. Thanks

So if I took 20mg one morning could I technically wait 4 days before taking my next dose without withdrawing?

The reason I'm asking is because yesterday morning I took 20mg in hope of maybe catching that initial buzz I got during my induction period. I heard that bupe's ceiling is around 32mg so I figured if I just took more than my maintance dose I could maybe catch a buzz. Wrong... Felt zilch.

The stress (and hours) was incredible and now that they've achieved success he doesn't have to work as hard and is reminded daily (by boredom and loneliness) that he didn't bring anyone along on this journey (no other friends or a girlfriend). All his friend have gotten married and had kids so he has no one to hang out with. Now his neighbors and other junkies have filled that space with morphine, heroine, oxy, etc.... 

He's been missing work and raging on the worker bees to the point that everyone knows he's using and no one wants to work with him.  They have to replace him at work and his partner has agreed to put him on administrative leave and let insurance pay 100% of his rehab costs to get him back on board. 

I spent four days with him to make sure he stayed safe and get him to rehab.  He insists that he doesn't have a problem and that he doesn't need rehab. By refusing rehab he has essentially made himself homeless and I know for a fact that he was using every day that I was there because his pupils were tiny little dots every morning and his behavior is not typical.

He grew extremely agitated and borderline violent when I called him out on it.  He kicked me out of his apartment so I went ahead and got a plane ticket back home but I'm worried to death about him. 

He did text me that he called the rehab facility and is going in for depression sessions but not rehab.  That's not enough to keep his job and without that he will be homeless in a month or so. Even if he goes to rehab he will not get his job back but could get a chunk of cash from his partner buying him out just to get rid of him. I don't blame his partner.  I saw first hand how abusive and guilt-trip b.s. trips he can put on people.

I love, love, love my brother and this is not him. How can I help?  I live on the other side of the country so it's not like I can pop in every week or so to check on him physically. It's killing me. I've been crying all day for having to leave him yesterday.

What ends up happening is I'll be trying to register and, during the process of pulling back on the plunger, I'll move the needle and push through the vein or slip out of it. This will happen many times and eventually I get to the point where the dope liquid looks exactly like blood, which makes it near-impossible to recognize when I actually do register.

So now for the question I want to know the main difference between Suboxone (Buprenorphine+Nalaxone) and Subutex(Buprenorphine). I know the Nalaxone is there so you don't abuse the Suboxone by shooting it up and that the Nalaxone causes precipitated withdrawals if you take it too soon after consuming any type of opiates. I want to know if Subutex causes any similar effects if taken too soon also or if that's only the Suboxone. My biggest problem is waiting 12-24 hours after my last fix to take my Suboxone and having to actually feel like shit before I can take it. So my plan was to take my last fix before bed and shortly after I wake up take a very small dose of Subutex so I don't get any WDs or any cravings the take another small dose of Subutex at night when I'm about to try to ""sleep"" a little. I obviously can't do that if Subutex causes any similar effects to Suboxone when it comes to the precipitated Withdrawals.

I see him get a bottle of water, then put some of the water and heroin in the cap of the water bottle. Once it's mixed/dissolved pullback into the syringe and then inject it in the vein on your arm.

The syringe I got is 1CC half-inch tip syringes. Just got them from CVS. The amount in the syringe is just barely above 50. I used less than a 1/4 of whats normally in those little baggies. 

I'm about to inject this. obviously injecting heroin is not the best idea, but I'm going to do this anyway. Based off everything I posted above, will I get high and not die? Also, I made sure there were no air bubbles. Water is slightly foggy due to using a small amount of dope.

I normally snort heroin. Maybe a few times a month. Whenever I do usually one bag is enough for me. I never straight up nodded off before, but two would probably do that for me.",1455960543.0

Of course I usually keep a strip in my wallet but for some insane reason that I can not comprehend I took it out and put it on the counter (why?!? Seriously why) so now I'm at work and was feeling fine until I realized I forgot to take sub.

I'm sure it's all in my head and I'd feel fine if I never thought about forgetting.

I see idiots targeting certain individuals and downvoting every comment they make, literally going through the person's entire post history with a couple of their dipshit mouth breathing friends and downvoting everything. I see good quality advice and factual information being downvoted by ignorant morons who don't have a fucking clue about anything.  I see those same clueless tools spewing out false information when they don't know what the fuck they're talking about and yet these posts are somehow UPVOTED. 

I'm calling on the mods to start deleting irrelevant posts that should be in r/drugs or r/benzodiazepines.  As well as the ""I found a vicodin pill can I take it"" and the ""I just took some opiates 2 hours ago and I'm high am I ok to go to bed?"", and any other stupid question that gets asked every other day where the answers are RIGHT THERE IN THE SIDEBAR.  I dunno if you mods can sticky a FAQ post or something, but I say it's past time we take back this sub and make it the great awesome place it used to be.  I've literally seen the same fucking question worded differently on the front page at the same time.  Stop abusing the upvote/downvote system based on the fact you're a butthurt crybaby and use it the way it's meant to be used.  Upvote good advice in harm reduction or if the comment contributes to the topic.  Downvote bad/dangerous advice and irrelevant bullshit.  And if you don't know?  Then don't fucking click anything because you newbs have bastardized the system.

Sorry, just had to get that off my chest.  Shout out to all the people keeping it real, and as always, stay safe friends.


Thanks


TL;DR:   stop posting bullshit that doesn't belong here or questions that are answered in the sidebar, stop giving advice if you've taken a couple percs in your life and don't know what the fuck you're talking about, and stop abusing the comment voting system based on the user who posted it instead of the content of the comment.

From both sides of the spectrum. I've had straight edge people decline things because they have an ""addictive personality"" (it's fine if you don't want to and it's fine to have your reasons but imo this one is silly) and chippers brag about their non-addictive personality.

Idk I just feel like that general statement is bad. You can say you have self control problems or something but I think the phrase ""addictive personality"" really reflects how we view addiction in society—as a personal defect. Fact is I've known crackheads who aren't addicted to dope and people who drink every day but hate weed. There is no such thing as a blanket ""addictive personality,"" or if it is, it's very rare. I don't hear gamblers say they have an addictive personality a lot because I feel like that's an obvious case of everybody recognizing that the person is addicted to that specific feeling and not just ""prone to addiction.""

All drugs and drink take you away from the moment and have that general blanket appeal. But I just get annoyed when people act as though it's a matter of personality and not a matter of your brain chemistry/psychological thought process changing. ",1456016556.0

I recently found a stellar email source for Df118's (dihydrocodeine 40mg instant-release tablets) and am having a field day.  I was a daily codeine user before discovering DHC and was getting incredibly bored with it.  DHC lasts longer and has more of a euphoric feeling than plain codeine, which is too sedating for my liking.  One or two 40mg DHC tablets keeps me high for *hours*.  Throw in a Fioricet or Xanax and it's off to The Land of Nod.  Best part about pure DHC is no more messy CWE's!  

Do you prefer codeine or DHC, and why?  I know DHC isn't as common in the U.S. but can't for the life of me figure out why.  It seems like a good intermediate between codeine and hydrocodone.  

EDIT:  I should add that I'm plugging the DHC to get the full effect.  It's oral bioavailability is shit...like 20-25%, so swallowing it is kind of a waste.  ",1456012834.0

It was good - real good. It wasnt too expensive, but thinking i could get a better deal if i bought a little bit more. I found another seller, and bought some more.

The first stuff looked like any heroin ive ever gotten.  The second stuff looked less powdery and more granular. It was also more brown. Looking back on the listing, i see its #3. It came from Texas. So i added water and shot it up. Little happened. Doing almost a quarter of a gram (first order less than .1 had me nodding hard), i looked up #3 and realize that #3 had to have a acid added. So i grabbed some lemon juice (only thing i had), and added 10cc's for every 50cc of water. Still very little happened. I wasnt sick (even though i shouldve been), but i wasnt high either.

From MDMA to drug dealing to abusing xanax to ODing on heroin and getting thrown out of school and even smaller things like how you were kind of dating [redacted] when we started to date. There are all these things that you’ve kept from me and it sucks. It sucks that I can’t feel like I can trust you right now and that is why i am upset and need some space

-This is a hypothetical survey of sorts. I am attempting to learn additional in-depth perspectives from those who have a serious addiction to injecting opiates. Beyond this, I am attempting to further my understanding of the psychology to those who have an addiction to opiates (myself included). 

I am curious to know - if you could *magically* go back in time and stop that day you first injected, would you? Or was switching to IV more efficient? 
(I know people like it in the beginning, as it saves money and dope at first, but what about months - years later? Still worth switching?)

I do apologize if this post is somewhat unorganized, but your insight could help save a life, so bear with me if you can.

(Your privacy is important, and I desire ZERO personal information. You are all John and Jane Doe's for the purposes of this post. Remember all reddit users can make a ""throw-away"" account to keep it anonymous if you don't already have one, or if you do not feel comfortable sharing a part of your personal opiate experience). 

I would like to know from you fine people (primarily those who initially began their addiction sniffing dope / pills, and then decided to progress to shooting for whatever reason), was switching a better decision? 



(I am trying to avoid the needle (contrary to my username) and I sniff a LOT. My tolerance is insanely high because I used to sniff suboxone for like 3 years; chipping ECP and 30's on and off whenever I procure some.) *It is also an important factor that (I believe) due to my abusing the subs for so long, it fucked with the dope-high, and I can no longer nod; only fall asleep. Breathing and heart rate are fine, but I haven't gone on the nod in years.*

Now, do any of you think it possible to go back to snorting if you so wanted to? (Reasons don't matter ~ maybe the veins have collapsed, or some are tired of getting an abscess or sickness, whatever.)

Remember, this is completely hypothetical. Is it still worth it for you (at present-day) after however long you have been shooting it up?

For those of you who do use IV and stopped snorting altogether because you prefer affects of the needle, are there any regrets by switching from nose to needle? Is it possible to manage at all, or is it crossing the line from manageable, to broke and fiending in a few months - years?

tl;dr Was it worth switching to shooting up from sniffing, and does anyone regret using a hypodermic for the first time and wish they could go back to snorting?

I read that you are not supposed to cut the patches.

He has finally hit a wall after years of eating roxies/morphine and drinking on the daily. Currently about 6 roxies a day and a liter of vodka.

Like I said, he's a very close friend and we used to run together back in the day. We both taught each other some very bad habits, but a few years ago I had to get out and so moved to the west coast. He stayed back on the east coast and I guess things continued downhill for him. He just reached out to me and wants to go to rehab etc... I'm responsible enough these days and am trying to do all I can for him from out here but I can't help like I could if I was out there or knew the resources better out there.

Until I can get him connected with a rehab program (he has insurance and I am going to direct him to the place that I went.) are there any free suboxone/methadone programs out that way? Anything that would work with insurance. Unfortunately he's broke right now too (a habit like his will do that) so its not just as simple as telling him to cop some subs from someone.

Anyone have any suggestions? I'm actually pretty worried for him going through WD from liquor and that much roxie at the same time. Is there anything else you all can think of that I might be able to help him out with?

Edit: Let me be clear, I'm not looking for hookups or anything. Not trying to source. I'm looking for advice, especially in finding a clinic, detox center, or some kind of recovery. I don't know how any of that or if any of that works with insurance.

I've lived with my parents since I was 18, because of issues like depression and whatnot. Anyway, back in November we lost our place, had to stay with my parents' friends, and I was there for about a month. But, I got kicked out because I couldn't find a job even though I was trying. Luckily, I had my sister and brother in law to take me in. This was around the middle of December and I stayed with them until the third of this month. The whole time I was with them, I only got the meds I take (Subutex) on the second of both January and February. But, for some reason, I didn't have any withdrawals. It was weird. Maybe it was the change of environment, something about bein at my sister's?

Anyway, on the third of this month I basically stayed at the hospital for two weeks because my dad's in there and had sepsis from some sort of blister on his foot that just got way worse in, like, only two days. The whole time we were at the apartment, my mom and I only got three tex, having to split between two people, so it was hard. 

Anyway, at the start of this month, my mom got us a townhouse apartment so that's where I am now. I'm not going through withdrawals, but my mom is, and I'm still in pain and want the damn high. Anyway, we currently don't have a car, so we only have like two contacts and one of them is only an intermediary to her friend who sells them, and we're trying to get her to lend us one until the third of next month, but the girl we know won't answer the phone. Then we have this other person we know, went to the doctor on Friday and promised to let us have one, but he won't fucking answer the phone. We got in touch with his grandmother, who says he has the flu. So I don't even know if he'll come through or not.

One of my parents needs to get in with a Subutex doctor. I'd do it if I thought I could, but I always have the worst luck with doctors. If I thought I'd have luck, and could get the money, shit I'd start going. I mean, I'd rather have the stuff to take, but I take way less than what they'd prescribe (they write 2 a day, I only take 1/3), so I could at least sell some to supplement a job, if I can find one.

So, as many of you know, yesterday was my first time trying Heroin (FINALLY!). I won't go into the prices, since as I'm sure without a doubt in my mind I overpaid tremendously for it. Which I had no issue doing since it is literally never in my area. And by never, I mean NEVER. It's not an exaggeration, it's a fact. But back to the main reason to this post. I spent a big chunk of change on the tan powder with an almost dirt-esque consistency over the course of the day. I know I had to have burned through ~0.7 of this lovely substance through the course of about 15 or 16 hours. But here is the more salient facts in a run down.

I'm having a good time with a few of my friends. I had went and picked up 20 Lortabs earlier in the night, and popped 3, so I was feeling pretty warm. As the night progressed we had went and ate Krystal's and had picked up so beer. Well I got the genius idea to get a dub of some coke. I don't do coke that often. This itself was only my 3rd or 4th time doing it in my life, and I had for some reason thought 4 people could share a 20 sack of coke. I found out 30 seconds after I broke it down into lines that I could have never been more wrong in my life.

Regardless of how rapidly the coke had depleted, we were having a good time. Just as I was about to call for some more coke, a dude I normally get Roxis and fent patches from calls me up (Miraculously literally 2 minutes after finishing up a conversation about wanting some heroin) asking if I knew anyone who messed around with ""Heron"" as he called it. I was like ""umm yeah..me."" Well he said for me to come through in an hour, to which I happily obliged. Well my ride for then ended up dipping out on me 20 minutes later. Well my boy says he'd bring it by to me, which never ended up happening. So I go to bed more than distraight. Well I'm woken up the next morning by a phone calm from my boy again saying he was sorry and that he was on his way. Boy I was ecstatic. He finally pulls up and I buy 60 bucks worth. He pulls off and I tear open the tape-wrap that encased the paper to closer examine this soon-to-be-experienced beauty. Smelled faintly of pickles. Was a weird consistency that reminded me oddly of a damp sand. Was tan. And I could see traces of red and green flakes (which idk what it was).

Fast forward about 2 hours after obtaining this treasure and I'm at a different friends house. I had went ahead and combined all the sacks into one piece of folded paper and had already cut a straw and stuck it into my wallet along with my dope. As I'm sitting in my friends car, I take a less than average sized bump just to test the waters. I wait 20 minutes and feel very slight to no warm euphoria. I decide and eagerly double the previous sized bump and sniff that. As I'm sitting there waiting for it to hit me for 5 minutes, I begin to get skeptical and think that I had gotten ripped off when all at once a wave of familiar warmness and euphoria sweeps over me. It freaks me out at first. So much that I jump up and start to walk around just to make sure I wasn't going to fall out or whathaveyou. It begins to stop peaking and I'm at peace. I've fallen  in love. I'm itching harder than I ever have before. I feel fantastic. I call my boy and tell him how much I love it and that of be by later to get more even though I hadn't even finished what I had already got. I spend the rest of the day in a warm, itchy, and hardcore nodding state. I will NEVER forget this day. Ever. I can only hope I'm able to experience this glowing warmness again soon one day.

Tl;dr: I tried heroin against all pressuring not to and what a surprise, I'm more in love with it than anything preceeding it.",1456082394.0

-So first I had a seizure i tripped on dxm while on a regular dose of u47700  then after the very brief trip i woke up in the hospital. apparently mom watched me have a seizuure

- the second seizure was a couple days after i did some cocaine and a bunch of u47700 as it seems it wasnt affecting me. i think woke up just before 6am, apparently i seized out at like 540 and got conscious just before 6 if i remember correctly.

today i ate a rather larger amount of u47700 like an idiot. and then in bed trying to get some sleep i noticed my hands were shaking/jitterings and hands are shaking, my heart was also beating hard/fast then slow.

anyways what im asking is, is there anything i can use/do to minimize my chance of having a fullblow seizure? right now im just laying in bed in a  small blanket pillow fortress incase the worst happens. i have hope i wont seize out due to the fact im conscious while the shakes started, whereas before i just completely blacked out and woke up in the hospital. also this time round im only on this and nicotine (smokes).

so any suggestions about what to do?

right now im just focusing on my breathing nice deep slow relaxed breaths. my mouth is dry like 80 year old woman so im going to drink a bunch of water. also feel kinda like puking so might puke while im in the washroom puking.

So are there any tricks or habits you guys have picked up over the years that have actually helped in this scenario? Maybe things like hiding/dispersing what you have instead of keeping things in one place, or trying to make yourself wait longer between doses, or instead focusing more on dosing with as small amounts as possible?

This isn't about tapering/quitting as much as it is enjoying what you have, while simultaneously prepping to minimize the damage once everything is gone.

For me, 1) my first post here was in June 2012 about how much hydrocodone I should give my girlfriend for her first time with opiates (I had only taken hydrocodone once before and thought I had a naturally higher tolerance compared to what I'd seen recommended and wanted to double check what I should give her), 2) since then I've graduated high school, gone to college, dropped out and been arrested/put on probation. I also graduated from taking small amounts of hydrocodone to IV heroin (though I'm currently sober) and 3) I'd tell myself to dump that girlfriend, move on and to either quit using opiates or to go ahead and start IVing dope (gotta save money and get that better rush). I would also tell myself that if I'm going to IV, I need to take my time with my shots and take more care in harm reduction with it.

The definition of ""regular"" is obviously broad, and I would encompass medical use into it as well.

I used oxycodone for a while then finally moved to insufflating heroin, which I have been doing on a fairly regular basis for a long-time.

So first I will begin with the ingredients. 

* **Adderall - or pretty much any stimulant**. The stronger the better, but if you don't have a tolerance to stims you can get by with a weaker one (vyvanse, ritalin, etc). I actually like vyvanse better than adderall. It's technically a weaker stim but I find that it has a different effect on me than others. It's energy that is accompanied by a weird sense of clarity. It doesn't bug me out like other stims, and that's what makes stimulants counterproductive for some people. eg. you take it to get work done or study but you could end up taking too much and start getting things wrong or dropping things. Anyway, I digress...

* **Tobacco**  I guess vaping would suffice, but when I did it myself I didn't experience any increased bowel activity. 

* **Good knees** I'll get into this in a bit


Ok so you've been high on your choice opiate for at least a week straight, you realize you haven't pooped. This disturbs you because you also remember how wonderful it was to take shits. It was like a relief that you could count on, but not anymore. It was your alone time, your breather, it was your daily sanctuary. 

Then you swear to yourself you will take a shit today or die trying. If you don't get your sanctuary back then your life would no longer be worth living. 

This is it.

This is the end.

---

You realize the very thing that caused this dreaded shitless society could also be used to fix it. Not our haloed opiate overlords, but another god in this heathenish pagan religion we call drug use. Our pagan beliefs are much different than any other. Since our gods are persecuted among the non believers, they have grown into a very unique and powerful entity. The gods would not be able to thrive, or even exist, under prohibition without having capitalism to fuel their fire. The very system that has instituted this prohibition under the guise of public health and safety, and most importantly, to institute a strong moral stance against the gods, all while they profit from this persecution behind the scenes (I choose not to go into more detail on this aspect in this communique. The system's public must be blinded by a false sense of communal morality. Those morals are usually referred to as 'American values', but has gone by other names as well. However once again, I digress...

I'm sure you're asking yourself ""what the hell am I supposed to do with these ingredients? You're just going on and on about things we all already know. What makes you think we don't already make the daily sacrifice for our favorite deities? You must not think much of us!""

However nothing could be further from the truth. I'm trying to save your colon and even your entire GI tract. You could go on for the rest of your years full of shit, but I don't want that. The sad part is if you aren't making the sacrifice and properly prostrating to the true gods, you will be both literally and figuratively full of shit. Who wants that? 

Tobacco is a strange deity. She makes you think she's a give, but she's anything but that. She will try to convince you that you are better off with her and that she can improve your brain function, among other advancement. This is true, however she uses those enhancements to blind you from her true intentions. She leaves a little bit of herself inside of you every time you prostrate. This allows her to use your internals with the intention of reproduction. Her children take many forms, however they all have a a similarity. They are a part of you. You will die. 

Stimulants have an interesting history. Some of the worst people in recorded history have abused her, and how did she cry from it. The nazis gave methamphetamine capsules to their soldiers in a failed attempt to create some kind of Übermensch, or more specifically in this situation, a 'super-soldier'. A man who is better than the other men. How can you create a man who's better than the others if you're going to make 100 of them?  It failed. The drugods did not want it so it was not so.

Digression seems to be a theme of this article. Sometimes there is so much going on around a topic, it becomes impossible to ignore the details and impossible not to report them. 

The formula for a clean colon under the opiated existence is as follows. 

When you wake up to the morning of a day who's schedule is predetermined to be like the last ~7 days and involved doing opiates and not shitting. On that day you prostrate and take the sacrament as you prepare to start the day. The time until the next step will depend on whether you went IR or ER. However that does not prevent you from continuing to the next step. I just cannot guarantee you will find relief. 

If you have a garage, go in there. I find the uncontrolled temperature along with a bit of shelter as to avoid exposure to the elements, helps the process. If you don't have a garage or any other loosely insulated shelter, you should still be ok.

Standing with your feet ~8"" apart, light a cigarette. Hit it a couple times, then bend your knees into a squatting position. Imaging yourself bending your knees as though you were going to take a shit in the woods. This step is a very delicate one as there have been instances of relief coming much too soon. However if you've been deprived of defication for a long while, you'll probably be able to contain your crap until the final step. 

As you squat, continue smoking your tobacco. I prefer high quality tobacco leaf. My favorite factory cigarettes are Parliament full flavors. If you are a full flavor kinda person, I highly suggest trying them. They are not very common, you may have to hunt them down. When it comes to loose leaf, Shag is king. The most common pouch is Drum, which is *okay* but you can get much better for the same price. Bali Shag is one of the best common shags in America. Some tobacco shops even have their own blends, these can be extremely satisfying. 

Allow me to explain how this method works. The tobacco acts as an extremely mild stimulant, and has a very quick acting effect as a laxative. The stims you took have most likely started working their magic by now and you might feel a sense of euphoric energy, as well as a heightened sense of your extremities. This will help open the gateway to the puddle.

The position you have squatted in is the natural human position for deification. It's the position we have been taking for thousands of years. The toilet has existed in different forms, but all of them have only been around for the last 1000 years, tops. 

At this point, you'll probably know exactly what to do and my guidance is no longer needed. Unless you need to be pointed towards the nearest bathroom because you're gonna be unleashing the fecal Antichrist for at least 5-10 minutes. 

I hope this brief journey into the complex world of psychopaganism has shown you a new way to think about life. I hope I kept your interest and maybe even helped guide you down the true path to enlightenment. Your post digestion evacuation has likely given you a clearer view of the universe, use it to contemplate existence and keep searching for the unseen, yet obvious, fabric of the universe.

How's everyone morning/night/day? As you can tell from the title mine isn't so great ha. So after being a lurker on Reddit for a decent amount of time and stumbling across this beautiful platform where there's no judgement, and everyone is equal, I had to freaking post. Because emotionally speaking I'm just fed up to shit. The whole vicious cycle, and doing it for years, in and out of rehab, couch hoping, disregarding loved ones. Losing all material items around me. Like, god damn. I'll be 25 in November and here I am with a laptop and a large bag of clothes to my name. Living with a lifelong friend. Who's currently in a different town, spun out to shit. Doing who the hell knows. On top of that, I haven't spoken to my mother or step father, nor most of my immediate family in quite some time. My brothers, sisters, and ALL cousins we're/are addicts, so they get it. We're all on our deeply backwards progression, hopefully leading somewhere positive....But the most fucked up part is that my grandfather, who was basically the most influential person I've ever set eyes on, passed away a few months ago. And I COULDN'T even attend his recent funeral because I was too dope sick. Along with the fact that I entirely wanted to avoid confrontation between me and certain family members. Like, we're a loud, Italian family. They'll fucking argue ANYWHERE So there was no chance in hell I could be apart of such a situation. So here I am, writing this at 6:30 am because for the 2,000 time, I can't sleep a damn wink. I'ts been a few days, since I used, after relapsing and going hard for about 6 months....So it's nothing I couldn't handle, as I've certainly been through far worse...But when the fuck am I going to stop putting myself through this? ALSO - Sorry for all the sporadic and semi-formulated sentences that create some half assed fluency with my train of thought. Sleep deprivation is a bitch. And ever since I finally started to feel emotion again (yesterday and tonight) I've done nothing but cry, and weep. Not only for my grandfather, who I am ONLY now mourning, but when my GMA passed last year, I was so deep into tar that emotions we're not apart of my ego. Didn't shed a tear. And she was my fucking rock. My foundation. Someone who NEVER gave up on me. Going to EVERY baseball game I ever played. With two gatorades and a pack of seeds ha. A true Italian Grandmother. But I literally felt no emotion. Even when a few months after, I went to rehab and got clean. There was just nothing there. And even while I was clean for almost a year, nothing was there. Sure, happiness, etc we're all there. But the emotional stress, pain, and general wear and tear from death and loss hadn't penetrated a single ounce of me....Until now. Laying here in this bed, with the fucking weight of the universe it feels like pressing down on me. Emotion, guilt, shame, all these emotions I just couldn't feel for so long have hit me like a tidal wave, basically as I am typing this out. Thank goodness for this website. And what we have here. Never have I opened up this much. But here I am, straight pouring EVERYTHING I have and am feeling onto a public forum. Because I trust you beautiful people. And that's how it's always been my whole life. Being a hardcore gamer, I always felt solace in the people I met. Shooting the shit with virtual friends I can say will be at my wedding (lawl single AF). But in all seriousness, if there's anything I've learned, its that addicts, even though we've never spoke, nor hung out, share a common bond. One of extreme heart ache, disaster, and the willingness to give it all up for this god damn drug. It's been so long since I've opened up like this...I just want to ramble. So much shit has happened. The highest highs. The lowest lows. Multiple Overdoses. Even more friends who's OD's were fatal....This drug has taken so fucking much. Yet here I basically sit with open arms, always willing to forgive and forget. Like wtf? How could I allow such insanity. My mom holding me in her arms. Blue in the face, with a questionable pulse only to get what I think was adrenaline from the ambulance. With my mother RIGHT THERE. To this day, my mother lives with such horrid trauma. While here I am, not skipping a fucking beat. It just makes no sense. I tell her, I WANT TO feel the emotion. I want to feel the heartbreak she has. But no matter how much I try to communicate, it only creates tension. Not resolve. I've pretty much disregarded all of my friends I've grown up with. At this point it's just running partners. With all my true friends basically standing back, nothing know what the hell to do with me. Can I blame them? Absolutely not. I'm the one who's basically isolated myself into single form existence. They're tried everything they can. Unfortunately for me, even if I'm not using, I have the ability to find absolutely BLISS in pure solitude. Not talking, nor interacting with friends or family. Just getting lost in my work, games, and studies. So that extreme isolation doesn't help at all. Something I truly need to work on. And the SEX?>>> what sex. The only thing  I've been fucking for basically the last 2 years is La Heroina. Seriously. How fucked is that. I'm 24 years old and I have the sex drive of a 90 year old man. I've had sex two separate occasions with different females in the last....going on 2 years now. And now that I am getting sober, again, the HORMONES ARE REEEEAAAAALLLL haha. farrrrrk. I just want to finally be done with this stoof. And with summer right around the corner...I MUST. Because summer in Sonoma County/San Francisco/Northern California is just...gorgeous. And I just don't have another summer of this vicious cycle. Spending the entire summer inside? Fuuuuckkk that! With that said....I feel like I certainly can end it. There's too much to write, and these issues are certainly the biggest demons I've been carrying with me.  So to WHO EVER reads this....I wrote this for all of us. I know there are some people out there who can relate.  Whether you're homeless, have $0 to your name, or you're just going through the daily grind DONT HESITATE TO POOOOSSST OR MESSAGE ME.

I check on him throughout the day, and no answer til finally around 7PM. At this point he says all is good and to come through.

But my whole life I have had dermatillomania, since I was at least ten I have had the horrible habit of picking and creating massive scabs on my scalp. Whether it be because I'm stressed out, upset, or just flat out bored.  Ever since I started doing opiates it has got increasingly worse because of the obvious itchiness caused by the histamine release.  It has moved from my scalp to my stomach and legs.  

Basically I was wondering if anyone else has this issue.  Oh and the lovely goosebumps from withdrawal also lead to picking my skin.  I know it's common for skin picking to happen when using drugs, but I feel like I'm taking it so far.  I can get lost for hours with picking at my skin.  It causes so much happiness when I pick a perfect scab.  I hate doing it though, my skin is ruined and is starting to get scars in places.  And it gets to be so painful and I'm afraid of infection.  When it was just my scalp it didn't matter if I had scars there, but it is also getting to the point where I am starting to lose hair because of it. 

 I feel like I can never get a boyfriend(which is already hard because of drug use).  Basically I'm posting this because i'm really fucking high and wanted to see if anyone else has this issue.  Happy nods, and if you are a skin picker, I guess happy skinpicking lol. Wow I didn't realize how long this was!

TL;DR I have been picking my skin since I was ten and was wondering if anyone else had this issue.",1456285728.0

Title, except not asking in general, but how much/long do *you* need to use to feel physical withdrawals when you quit using?

I've taken opioids for about four years. I've never had PWD -- so take this for what it's worth -- but I've used hydros, perks, and roxy up to 6 days in a row more than a few times and never felt PWD. I've heard PWD comes on quicker once you experience it the first time, though. Excuse my greenness.

Curious to see how much use causes you guys' PWD.

&nbsp;

Over the past few weeks, I've seen my tolerance double. I've switched from mostly pills with rare dope, to almost all dope, due to availability and tolerance. I'm getting more shit done because I'm more motivated and in a better mood, but when I'm not using (either because I just woke up or I'm trying to ""behave"" for the day), I literally just want to die, I'm so depressed. I feel like an empty shell of a human without opiates, and like myself only when I'm using. 

&nbsp;

The times between using have gone from a week, to 5 days, to yesterday. I'll be sitting there and think to myself ""okay, well, it's been a while and you've been good--go dip into your stash"", and then I look at the date on my phone, and it hasn't been ""a while"", it's been a fucking day. My ""chipping"" has turned into regular use. 

&nbsp;

I love being high more than I enjoy anything else. I don't really enjoy anything else. I don't want to stop, and I'm afraid that this will overrun my knowledge that I *have* to. I can't lose my job, I can't lose my family...I can't keep this up. And if I quit at this point, I'll experience only mild withdrawals (probably just some diarrhea/cramps and insomnia). I know the depression will be horrific though, and that's my greatest barrier to stopping right now. 

&nbsp;

seeing a therapist, yes, and she's as good as I'll let her be. She can point things out, and make suggestions, but if I don't listen to her, well then.... She warned me about this when I started using the occasional oxy years ago, and I knew I was playing with fire. I just thought I'd be able to keep it under control. And I did--For years I was damn good at keeping myself in check. I don't have insurance (god bless America) so I can't afford to go get benzos or antidepressants or anything medical at all. 

&nbsp;

I know this is a story you've all heard a million times. Shit, I know *I've* heard it a million times. Everything--from the tolerance going up to going from pills to h, to thinking I'd be in that 1% that could use once a month.

It gave me such a bad histamine reaction. Rash/ swollen puffy eyes. The itch I got from it was nothing like I've ever experienced from any other opiate/opioids. I was itchy but it was a painful itch.

1. How does this program differ from other shows on the topic? 
There is some terrific reporting on the epidemic.  I think in two hours we cover not just the origins of the epidemic, we report on why the epidemic has not been abated and we examine what needs to be changed in order to contain the worst drug epidemic in our history.  It's all told through intimate and deeply revelatory stories of three addicts, a suburban mom, a 21 year old female from a middle class background, a musician who is now homeless. 
2. With so many different opinions on what is needed, was there anything that stood out as solutions or themes? 
The Obama administration is reviewing the restrictions on prescribing for medication assisted treatment, and from the experts we spoke with, it seems relaxing those rules could be a good start. We could also require insurance plans to include coverage for more than 30 days of inpatient treatment. That’s clearly not enough time to get someone clean.  
3. How did you recruit users? 
I spent a lot of time interviewing possible participants, listening to their life stories.  Sometimes I met them at drug court.  Others I met through the LEAD program in Seattle.   I was introduced to many people in the course of making this film.  I settled for participants that really touched me with their candidness, intelligence and ultimately their struggle.
4. How did you recruit family members? 
That was a lot tougher.  Once I had settled on my participants, I wanted to talk to their extended family about how addiction had impacted their lives, but many didn't want to participate.  The stigma of addiction is still so great.  I was very pleased that I managed to include Kristina's father in this film.  The portrait of a father struggling through his daughter's addiction was very powerful to witness.

5. What do you feel are the take away messages from the program? 
I think the big takeaway is that this epidemic is not unlike the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. Back then, we rallied to come up with solutions. We aren’t doing enough now.  Access to treatment is inadequate. Services stink. Relapse rates are way too high. There aren’t enough studies to tell us what works and what doesn’t work. Over half a million people have died from opiate overdoses in the last 15 years. We clearly can do better.   


I also want to humanize addiction.  It's time we talk about this differently.  To quote the former Deputy Drug Czar, Tom McLellan, ""We're
 gonna continue to pay the price for thinking of this as a lifestyle issue, a personality disorder. We're gonna pay that price for a very long time because it's standing in our way of medical progress, of public health progress.""

So let's start! I woke up with extreme depression (FUCK BEING BIPOLAR) and decided to just eat some benzos as I always do when I wake up (1.5mg flubromazolam). Ah, much better. Or so I think. 
  
Suddenly I notice all, and I mean ALL, my friends blocked me. It destroyed me. We had plans for the weekend. I just got half a gram of pure MDMA crystals out of NL as a suprise to split between all of us, free of charge for them of course!
  
So down the hatch there goes another 2.5mg flubromazolam followed by chugging down a beer! Please, chemicals. Give me some love or warmth, anything. Just make this pain and misery disappear. Please....  
 
So while I wait for everything to kick in my half gram of dope arrived which I already wrote off as scam/mail fuck up! Maybe today doesn't suck too hard huh?! So I railed 2 lines and smoked 2-3 hits of off foil, probably all in all 100-150mg. While im vaping my H, I feel the snorted stuff kicking in and start nodding off harder and harder so I keep vaping to reach nirvana. 
  
Please, be my friends. I don't wanna be lonely anymore. Please, just please don't hate me for this post. I consider ALL of you my friends now. If you want it or not, you are. I love you. <3

I've been browsing this sub for some time now and it seems that even a lot of the genuine addicts amongst you have your shit together more than I do.

I've suffered with anxiety and depression since I was a 14 or so. Didn't finish my schooling because of the daily anxiety attacks I was having. I'm 24 now, started using opiates 3 maybe 4 years ago. Never been physically dependent, with my usage varying between my depressed episodes. Using when I'm low, but being able to not touch the stuff when I'm OK (on medication).

I suffered pretty badly this past holiday season. Fell into it pretty deep, felt like I was going mad. I ended up thinking about things quite deeply, you know, thinking about philosophical questions that at the end of the day, have no real answer. Whether we can ever have meaningful free will, etc etc.

I don't have to tell you guys what opiates do for my depression. My drug of choice is poppy tea. It's cheap, long lasting and effective. I don't really look for any kind of rush, and in honesty I use more to relieve my mood than to get high. Nodding is more an annoyance to me than anything else (though that whole body feeling of bliss after a good nod is fucking amazing, granted). I'm sure everyone reading this knows just how powerful opiates are at killing depression dead. Like nothing else I've ever used in my life it obliterates, or rather, makes my fears of life seem ok. I go from lying there staring at the wall thinking about all the questions to being able to play a video game or enjoy some music.

I recently went about 4 days without a dose, and the physical withdrawals were fairly minor. Couldn't sleep, achy legs, hot n cold. There, but not too bad. But holy shit the mental torture. The first day is ok, but after that there is nothing in this world to be hopeful for and suicide is, if not the answer, the only action. None of this is new to me, I've felt these things long before I had even touched opiates.

I'm not entirely sure why I'm posting here. I'm 24 years old, I've never had a girlfriend or a job. I made some friends for the first time a few years ago, but that didn't make me feel better, nor did going out and socializing. More a distraction, which while effective, opiates are more so. I'm a mess of a human. Nearly all my teeth have rotted and I have scars from cutting and burning myself all up my arms and on my legs. 

Sometimes I find some kind of will to improve. I think to myself, well, this is easy really, you're just being a dick. Go out, exercise, eat right, meditate, be strong! the longest this has ever lasted without medication is a week or so. I will inevitably find myself overpowered by negativity and these philosophical questions that can't be answered.

I know the answer of course. ""Just do it"". The slogan of the strong. You just have to do it. Just eat right. Just exercise. Just meditate. Just try to be positive. I'm not here to say that this is the wrong answer, it's the only one. I will not improve my life without wanting to and putting in the effort, I take this as fact. The issue is that I can find no reason to want to, and on the rare occasions I do, it's short lived. I just don't know what to do. Every time I set myself up to succeed I fail almost immediately. I don't want to kill myself, I have parents and a few decent friends, and my mum in particular would be devastated, and I don't want to hurt her like that.

I suppose I'm trying to say that I can't find any way out of this. I've been like this for 10 years, opiates or no opiates. Opiates help and will no doubt drag me down further eventually, but what else is there? Effort and hard work of course, but that will never come from me, no matter how many revelations or bouts of hope I have.

I'm not so far gone as to see there is no possibility for things to change. Life is weird, and sometimes it can surprise you. It's even possible, if very very unlikely I will wake up tomorrow and decide that that will be the first day of the rest of my life, and change my life for the better. It's just, from my past experience, very unlikely. Still, there are options. My psychiatrist and my mum want me to start taking an anti-depressant. I've been on them before and a few of the SSRI's helped tremendously but the sexual side effects were too much. I've been prescribed and older tricyclic, but ironically don't want to use drugs. My psychiatrist also mentioned that I may have emotionally unstable personality disorder (a fancy way of saying borderline personality disorder). Not something I can argue with, though I tend to be more self destructive than outwardly towards other people than most BPD sufferers. I mention it because I've heard of a therapy called DBT, dialectical behavioral therapy, which may help. There are some tiny rays of hope, but I've had hope before and it never really works out.

Like I said, I know the answer, just putting it into practice seems like a product of luck or fate. Neuroscience and physics seems to me to have killed any chance of free will. ""Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."" Hell, in reading about it I find even the stoics of ancient greece took this to be the truth. And yet I still know that if I got up off my ass and did all of the things I should do I might find some kind of life worth living. Both of these views fight inside me and I feel like I'm going mad sometimes.

So I guess I'll sit here drinking my tea, waiting to either kill myself or to find the will to live. Maybe I'll find some kind of junkie jesus to inspire me, or some robin williams therapist to cut through my bullshit. Or maybe one of you guys were like me once? I know I'm not unique in my feelings or interpretation of the world, surely someone somewhere must have overcome this.

-
tl;dr Bad depression, can't find a way out, opiates are the only thing that help and can no longer believe in free will.

Anyway, sorry for the block of self pity. I'm just a scared kid really. Thanks for reading, any and all advice, including ""you're a pussy"" accepted.

Are people staring at me? I glance at my reflection in a car window; can't tell if it's just the shuddering anxiety or I really do look as bad as I feel. My nose is streaming and my sense of smell mostly went back when I was a kid and my boyfriend/pimp beat me because we'd run out of crack, but I can still detect the chemical stench of withdrawal in every gasp of icy breath. It could be worse - the 60mg of codeine I took when I woke up is keeping the rest at bay for now. I probably wouldn't have got out of bed and gone on this fucking mission if I had another strip left.

I arrive, sinking to the curb in grateful anticipation. Other passengers prefer to remain standing while we wait and I'm sure there's a metaphor or some shit in that if only I could think about something other than heroin for one damn minute. My legs have started to ache now, stomach cramping to let me know it's in the post. I check the time as we depart - 90 minutes of this hellish motorised limbo to go.

5 minutes out and I make the call -

""The alley. Was it you wanted, 8 dark and a light?""

*""Yeah, 75 right? Sweet man see you in 5.""*

Quick stop at the cashpoint and then run into Gregg's to split a note and buy a bottle of water. Biting down on the frantic, clawing desperation that makes me want to scream as I wait what feels like an hour to be served.

Cross the road and duck into the alley, trying not to gag as I pick my way through mounds of rotting food from the bins and filthy discarded clothes. He gets there a minute later and pulls me through a door into another alley I never knew existed, telling me how good the gear is as we complete our exchange...

Shit! I asked him to wrap them all up together and he has, after a fashion - loosely scrunched in a huge piece torn from a plastic bag. No way I can put this in my mouth without looking like a lopsided junkie fucking hamster. I'd be a stop & search waiting to happen. The walk through town is excruciating as I hold my gear in my pocket, hyper-vigilant and praying to nothing in particular to just let me make it to that first hit without getting stopped. 

I run through my routine as efficiently as possible, fighting the urge that goes with that getting-well hit to add just a little bit extra. Last time I woke up bruised and nauseous on the toilet floor after getting greedy and it's not an experience I'm keen to repeat (again). Quick wipe with an alcohol swab and I'm sliding the pin in, through the dent in my groin towards my femoral. The surrounding tissue feels different today and I keep getting the electric itch that says nerve. Eventually I get all the way in and pull back - no blood. Try again at a slightly different angle - still no joy. Pull the needle right out for another attempt a couple of millimetres higher, digging around now as the blood runs down my thigh. Back in the day every pair of jeans I owned had that tell-tale stain just below the crotch; funny how easy it is to fall so far, slipping back into the junkie behaviours and mindset that had never really gone away. That's what got me this time - that pervasive need for ""*just a little more*"". An ex-junkie boyfriend commented on it once, as we stood in the bathroom squeezing out enough toothpaste and shower gel and then *a little extra* and drinking tea with two *and a bit* sugars. I could get through £20 worth of gear just quickly enough that I barely clucked when it ran out, but that was unthinkable when my guy sold 3 for £25. I could have taken a break after the first or second bag, if I could only resist that craving for just one more hit. Right now though, my thoughts couldn't be any further from the idea of abstinence.

*Please let me get it, just this one, I'll deal with this vein being fucked and find somewhere else later but please give me this one so I can get well. Fuuuck... Please!* Scared but not yet allowing myself to truly believe that losing this hit is a possibility. Dark blood finally flows back into the barrel just as I hear the crackle of a radio. Police, security... it's probably nothing but it doesn't matter anyway as I push the plunger down, nice and steady as normality flows back into my veins. For now there are no problems.

I can't get high snorting perfectly good dope (#4). Just gets rid of the sickness while I watch my SO nod off.,"I can't be the only one whose nose is different. I always thought something wasn't right when I used to rip 30's. But now that I have no choice besides to insufflate H (#4) I now know something is wrong in there for sure. If I had to guess I would have to say my blood vessels are probably not in the air flow path or something. My nose shape is odd. The bridge is practically flat between my eyes and I have never been able to blow my nose like normal humans. 

One time a doctor looked up my nose and made a comment about how bad my allergies must be but I was confused because I don't have any bad allergies that I know about.. So something in there is big or enlarged and preventing me from absorbing really finely crushed powder inhaled in at a slightly stronger strength than a normal breath. After going up there I let it ""absorb"" for a few minutes with my head back and then I'll do a couple stronger snorts to make sure nothing falls out. At this point I usually get a kick to the back of the throat which is a bad sign for me because I assume that just means that it is going into my stomach after that. And that's my guess, that's the only powder that is getting into my system at all is the the drip! 

I think the drip is the only dope in my system because I'll go from slight withdrawal onset to just normal (not high) to nauseous. I get nauseous usually when I keep snorting more and more hoping something kicks in but in reality all that's happening is I'm pretty much just ingesting it orally since the drip is the only thing that gets into my system only to make me sick.

So does that seem right? That's got to be the only reason since my SO gets super faded on way less and we have about the same tolerance.  And that would also explain why I never saw the point when snorting oxy. I would just end up ingesting those orally when thinking I was snorting. 

Anyway to fix this? I was thinking about trying the Flonase stuff since the regular cheap nasal spray doesn't help clear my nose out beforehand.  I know I'm not doing anything that wrong but I have to figure something out because I don't think I want to try plugging again after a terrible unsuccessful attempt, but I don't know any other methods since I heard you can't smoke #4 and I have a fear of needles.

Bought a gram of U4 and a 150mg of fu-f. Finished the U4 relatively quickly with just a hint of hellish wd, pumped my daily pod dose up to 15grams just to stay not sick, not even well.

Into the fu-f. Hellishly short acting, fourty five minutes to sickness after last dose. Finished 150mg in three days, then went on to grams of pure powder. Pod supplier had a fire in the warehouse, so now I was operating purely on short acting fent analogues. 

Got worse and worse on the fu-f, thank god I found 4-fibf before I lost my job due to wd'ing at work and fucking up something beyond repair. This at least lasts a few hours before I am sick again, but I never last much beyond that. 

I currently make up nasal sprayers, going through about 75mg every three days, 25mg a day or so.

I figure I can taper down over the course of several sprayers consistently diluting the solution into lower and lower concentrations, but I am quite fearful of what happens when I get into the far off area of being nearly clean. 

My brain has been saturated in opioids for almost an entire year, I've done this before, with methadone, then suboxone, but I never felt normal afterward, hence delving back into the 'natural poppies' last march. 

I'm quite scared of what my brain will be like when I am through with this. There seem to be a lot of people who have been down this path before me, and I am just kind of wondering what I might be looking forward to.

I have several grams, or a few months at current usage rates, left, so running out is not currently an issue, I'm just concerned about keeping it together as i start to get to the point where I'm going to be sick all the time, sweaty and cramping all the time, and craving all the time-that's what it seemed like coming off the FU-F, but I might have done the dilutions far too quickly.....I might be able to be more sane with the 4-fibf, but I won't know till I get to that level...

This might not make any sense, I don't feel like much I say does anymore. Hopefully it does, and hopefully someone recognizes the territory and might have some advice, any advice.

I'm not an addict nor do I know or associate with any addicts, it's just not my scene lol. Additionally, I can count on one hand how many homies have been to my apartment.

So here's the story; I go to university in a city in southern Colorado called Pueblo. Pueblo has seen a huge rise in heroin use and is known for its sketchy nature. I don't live in the best neighborhood and often see what appear to me to be homeless addicts roaming the streets and hanging out in front of the gas station. 

So I came back to my apartment after going home for 5 weeks to see family and visit for Christmas. When I opened my door and walked in it smelled like absolute shit and cigrits, I just left it smelling like spliffs. and all my fucking stuff was gone and my apartment was trashed. Clothes and paper lying all over the ground, couches flipped and sawed open. Absolutey destroyed. They even shit in my toilet and didn't flush. Those mother fuckers. I also found a shit ton of burnt little foil pieces stained with brown, residue my belt was lying on my bed cinched tightly. 

Literally everything was gone, snowboards, cameras, laptops, broken skateboards lol, all my clothes, lava lamp. I hate to assume it was an addict but I just don't see anyone else being desperate enough to do something like that? 
I don't know. 

This shit is really poorly written, I apologize but i just thought you guys might get a kick outta this. At this point, I'm so beyond mad that it's comical to me.

If you don't like it, then fuck you.

When I am in withdrawal, during those times when I am awake at 4:03 AM and I have sweated and kicked and slept so much that I just have to jump out of bed and do something, anything to change my scenery, I will go and try to find something to do to take my mind off my misery.  A lot of times, I will get online and seek out and view real-life gore, or read accounts of tragedies or murders.  r/watchpeopledie and www.websleuths.com are my mainstays.  I don't do this every time I am in withdrawal, there are times when I will listen to certain music, and languish in nostalgia instead.

I don't really gloat over or relish the images; quite the opposite as a matter of fact.  My reasons for viewing such horrific scenes is simple:  It makes me feel better when I contrast these scenes with my situation.  Being dopesick is relatively tame compared to seeing what is actually inside a living man's sinus cavities.

Anyway, there's been a drought in town lately, to the point that I committed to buying basically anything and everything I could get my hands on lmao. So we'd gotten some overpriced blues to hold us over for ""about an hour."" That hour was supposed to be over at like 8pm. So when 10-10:45ish rolled around and we'd already ordered pizza to waste time and distract us, we got a call from her friend saying he had a couple points of tar if we were interested 

At first I was like NOOOOOOOPE, as I don't shoot and was like ""nothing sounds nastier than when people describe their monkey water"" lol until my friend reminded me it can be smoked. So we ran over and chilled for a second. I got 3pts. 

I'd never vaped anything off foil/chased the dragon so to say, so I was nervous but excited to get H in my without my nose/sinuses

I wasn't underwhelmed- it was def cool with my friend helping me keep proper lighter distance haha. It especially tasted great exhaling!!!!!!  

It's just weird to me that tar is going around this area. I'd never even heard it offered as an option until literally last night. Im not on ""the east coast"" as most anyone would define it, but I'm incredibly close lol. I know that ""ECP""/powdered #4 has been hitting the west coast lately- 

Any theories behind this? Do y'all think it's purely the Internet spreading ideas/desires? Cuz if you live on the west coast and you tell me you've never wanted to try ECP id say there's a 97% chance you're lying haha

I'd never wanted to try tar til my dumbass realized its smokeable. Now that I have, i am glad I did it but I'm not gonna pick up more. I try to take care of my lungs by having a small daily amount of weed every night and nothing else. I didn't do more than 0.15-0.2ish suuuuuuper maximum.

Anyway, everything I've read in regards to PAWS states that you should start feeling it ~24 hours after your last dose.  The small of my back is a bit tight and I didn't sleep much last night no matter how many bowls I smoked.  The mental strain is far more bothersome than the physical discomfort at this point.  It has consumed my thoughts for the past two days.  I'll gladly take that over being dope sick which is what I was petrified of in the first place.  Now that I'm *not* sick and don't feel as if I'm getting sick I'm starting to tell myself that I'm still just a ""recreational"" user and I still have a bit of time before it gets bad (read: fucking horrible as its kinda bad now)

On a typical day I'll take two 30's.   I've been pretty steady at this clip for about a year now with three years of consistent use at lower doses.  

I know I should just stay the course and delete my dude's number  (not like I don't have it memorized).  I get paid tomorrow and I'm pretty sure I'll be at his house bright and early.

I guess at the end of the day my question is that if it's been two days since I last used and I'm not curled up in bed (at work now) am I still at a point that I can just cut bait and get clean without having to suffer through PAWS?  Or is last night's sleepless night just the beginning?

Breaking Pills in half with just fingers

How to Avoid losing the effectiveness of subs as a result of going on & coming off them very often- A WARNING - 

-if you switch back and forth from using suboxone/bupe back to full agonist(oxy,dope) really often in short periods of time, after awhile you might find that every time you switch back to the subs they don't work as well each time, you will experience diminishing returns until the subs barely take the W/D away or don't work at all

How to avoid having to re induct with subs after taking a DOC vacation

-so you are using subs to maintain/are on them long term and find you want to take a vacation to use your favorite opiate DOC but you don't feel like waiting till your sick & doing an induction all over again when you get done your DOC vacation. You can simply lower your sub dose to something really low like maybe .5mg but under 1mg. You continue to take that low dose sub throughout your DOC using vacation so that you are never completely off the subs, but it's low enough dose that you can break through with your DOC. With this technique you can avoid the issue of having to induct all over again possibly risking PWD and you also avoid the problem i talked about above this one. If your looking to get a rush this isn't the best option for you but if your just looking yo enjoy a bit of your DOC without the trouble of coming off and going back on sub it may be a good option for you.

An hour later I was feeling the 'nod', itchty all over but didnt mind it, warm feeling but not exactly much euphoria.

So the idiot in me decided to rail the last 10mg, and I was overcome by a strong nausea which I think stopped me from enjoying the benefits. Someone over at the IRC chat recommended to lay down and it worked felt a lot better and I drifted off into a dreamy haze for 4 hours it felt like I was in limbo between consciousness and sleep.

After I awoke from this, I decided to cook some dinner as I felt quite hungry, bad move I saw it all back up again about 30 minutes later and felt terrible for the rest of the night.

I know some of you may say I was stupid for doing 20mg for first time but I read a lot of first time reports saying they had a blast on that dosage and I'm a fairly big guy and my tolerance usually goes naturally hand in hand with that, silly me :) Lesson learnt.

Anyway I've got some more coming soon hopefully, any tips on dosage this time and should I rail or ingest this time round? I'm looking for a 'rush' in a sense and to see what this opiate euphoria is really all about :)

Called the paramedics, and my boyfriend thankfully came too when they got here. Then this mornimg after my boss calling me asking me what happened, i had to make up some story because i would lose my job and where i live, and she said a guest heard someone over dosed. Which i denied. So hopefully i dont get fired. So i hung up the phone with her, realized my boyfriend was in the bed. I called his name and no answer. Bathroom door was locked, so i broke in. I found him laying on the floor. He wasnt blue. He was sweaty and barley responsive. Thankfully i got him to wake up. I broke the needles, and from what it looked like there was nothing left drug wise. I am just so scared. For my boyfriends life, for my job and my place to live. Addiction is no joke. Dope is no joke. I've never been more done in my entire life. AND on top of it, after not seeing my parents for 6 months they're finally coming to see us on Saturday.

&nbsp;

Been dating ""Julie"" for about 2 years. We're both in our late twenties, and have held professional jobs (me currently, but she has a menial job right now, for reasons listed below). She's the one that eased my passage into opiates.  She was an occasional user when I met her, I tried it, liked it, and here I am.

&nbsp;

Anyway, Julie was arrested with 2 bundles on her about 8 months ago.  First offense, she gets referred to drug court, where she'll be for at least the next 18 months.  She has to do a urine test every Wednesday, plus her probation officer can randomly stop by any day, any time for a random, unannounced, observed urine test.  And she's a sneaky PO.  She's come about 4 hours later the day of the court test, she's come at 8 at night, she's come on weekends. You get it.  She doesn't come every week though.  If Julie pisses hot ONCE, weather at court or at home, she'll be immediately arrested and automatically go to prison for one year, no excuses (maximum 3 years).  So she's lucky she got drug court,but the shit's no joke.

&nbsp;

Last week, Julie and I got into a huge fight because, well, I was an asshole to her.  I stopped using when she got arrested, mainly to be supportive of her.  Okay, I've chipped twice, but I told her about it and she always says the same thing ""You don't have to stay sober!  I'm the one who got in trouble, not you.  You're a grown man, you can use if you want. I promise, I don't mind"".    Anyway, we fight, I storm out, we don't talk, no texting, no phone, no visits, whatever.

&nbsp;

Well, today she starts texting me that she misses me, wants to try to make it work, can I come over and talk?  Well fuck yes I can!  I miss this girl.  I love her, more than I've ever loved anyone in my life.  I want to get our shit straight and have a family with her (no kids until we've both been clean at least a year-18 months, we've discussed this). 

&nbsp;

We talk, and it goes great.  She accepts my apology for being a dick.  She apologizes for her part in it (she's no angel, we both have baggage, and I try to keep in mind that being forced to get clean is mad stressful). She's sweeter than she's been in weeks. We hug, we kiss, things are great and I'm feeling awesome.  We have a couple of cigarettes and cuddle for a couple of hours before she has to leave for work.  So she's getting dressed, and I'm trying to tidy up (I'm a little of a neat freak), and I empty out the ash tray.

&nbsp;

There, in a paper cup inside the garbage, right at the top, are about 4 or 5 empty, ripped in half stamp bags. My heart just sank to the floor. I honestly wasn't snooping, it was right on the top of her full garbage bin.

&nbsp;

She doesn't know I saw them.  She didn't mention picking anything up...didn't mention she had the urge to use.  I know she's very emotional and sensitive, so it wouldn't surprise me if she used because of the added stress of our fight, which makes me feel like Super Dick.  I know she's a grown woman and makes her own choices, but still.  Fuccckkk man.  She's risking EVERYTHING.  And not to mention, I feel duped by her syrupy sweet attitude and actions and willingness to talk all of a sudden.  I feel like it was just High Julie acting high.  Looking back, she was kinda chain smoking (ironically, that's what made me empty the ashtray which lead me to finding the stamps) and using the back scratcher a lot.

&nbsp;

I didn't mention it to her yet...just gave her a hug and kiss goodbye (where I saw her itty bitty tiny pupils--so she can't even say they were a friend's or anything).  

&nbsp;

We're supposed to continue the conversation in a few days (we're both working a lot over the weekend).  I'm going to mention that us staying sober is vital to us succeeding as a couple...give her a chance to bring it up.  If she doesn't, I'll straight out ask her.  The future of our relationship depends on if she lies about it, or if she tells me the truth.  If she's honest, I won't be angry, I won't judge her.  If she had a slip up, she had a slip up.  I;ll be honestly upset that she's putting herself at such a huge risk (PRISON!), and a little upset that she didn't feel like she could reach out to me to tell me she was seriously considering using, but I'm not going to shame her.  But if she denies it or lies...well, then I guess we're done.  I'm willing and ready to give it up completely, but if she's not, while I respect her decision, I can't build my life on that.

&nbsp;

I guess I'm just venting, but I'm definitely open to advice or suggestions.

Edit:  I just realized...this might not even be the first time she's done this.  Maybe she's just been lucky so far with the urine tests.  I mean, I haven't seen her acting like this before or anything.  I'm getting ahead of myself I think...I'm just feeling a little betrayed now that it's sinking in.  Don't worry though, like i said, I absolutely don't plan on shaming her or kicking her when she's down.  We both knew a relapse was a possibility.",1456471577.0

I've been a lurker for a while (well, relatively...I'd say about a year or so), but never posted.  I recently created a new screen name after losing all of my information on my other one when my tablet crashed last week.  Sadly, I didn't back anything up with an email, and so I can't recover my password to my old account.

&nbsp;

Posting on one of the front page articles about opiates reminded me of this subreddit and I figured, what the hell, let me pop on over.

&nbsp;

I'm a HR advocate from the East Coast.  I'm currently a registered nurse working in a large medical center/hospital in NYC, although in my earlier days, I've worked in home care and nursing homes.  I'm also a former addict and abuser of all things opiate (DOC started out as oxycodone, then, as it often does, moved onto heroin after a while. I've used morphine, dilaudid, and even hydrocodone--meh--when I was desperate).  I left that life behind me years ago, when I was first going to school for nursing. I have a son, who I'm ashamed to say, is older than my sobriety.

&nbsp;

So I guess I'm here to just say hello for the time being, and maybe be of some use to any of you who ever need to talk.  I can also help to answer some questions if I have any experience or medical knowledge regarding the issue.

&nbsp;

So feel free to AMA.  If anyone isn't comfortable with my presence here since I'm not an active user, I appreciate that and will try my best to not engage you at all.

Looking forward to getting to know you all.  :)

Levofloxacin for the infection (its an antibiotic),

I never ever get nauseous (only fent has done that to me), and even with zero tolerance, it would take 30mg oxy, or 8mg dilaudid to get off, while friends would need 10 and 4, respectively.  I don't lose appetite, get overly itchy, or suffer many of the negative side effects (other than withdrawal, obviously).

Been taking tramadol for two years to manage fibromyalgia/depression. Dose has increased to 200-250mg most days.

Additionally, I was on 30mg of Cymbalta for one year, until about a month ago when I quit CT. I'm having bad rebound depression. All the physical withdrawals were done in 7-10 days, but I'm constantly exhausted, lethargic, anhedonia, etc....yet I have bad insomnia every night lately.

The main reason I quit Cymbalta was due to weight gain - 30 lbs in 6 months with no diet changes. I hear Wellbutrin is weight-neutral, and often causes weight loss. I also hear it's more ""energetic"" and good for those struggling with lack of motivation.
I don't want to do antidepressants long-term, but I'm open to reintroducing something and SLOWLY tapering off it in the warm weather, as i'm much worse this time of year in the eastern USA where it's cold and gloomy.

If I reintroduce something, I'd like it to be either Prozac due to the long half-life/easy taper, OR Wellbutrin due to weight loss and energy boosting properties.

However, I've read conflicting information about Wellbutrin re: it's CYP2D6 inhibiting properties. WebMD says it may block conversion of tram to DM-tram. Another source says it may boost tramadol effects. Which is it?

I'm a little concerned about seizure risk of wellbutrin + tramadol. I never had any issues w/ seizures or serotonin syndrome on Cymbalta w/ tram. Is the Wellbutrin seizure risk overstated or legitimate?

Overall, which would be a better choice for someone in my situation - Prozac or Wellbutrin? Or just ride it out and wait until I'm feeling normal again? It's crazy how some days even 250-300mg of tramadol doesn't make me feel energy and happiness for very long due to this rebound depression (or extended SNRI withdrawal, I can't really tell which it is). SNRI's are a fucking bitch and I will never ever go on one again.

This doctors was a good guy and was highly recommended. He had me on 3 subs a day, and after a two year period I eventually weened off of them. Throughout that period of time I was also prescribed 2mg Xanax 4x a day, 20mg Ritalin 3 times a day and a bunch of neuron tin and anti depressants. We all know how it goes and I would go through all of them rather quickly, and then call him mid month, tell him that I was getting a stomache ache from the Ritalin and he would then give me a new rx for 90 30 mg adderal ir. And also during this time I would say that the Xanax effects were diminishing and he would give me 120 klonopins 2mg each. This happened monthly like clockwork. After the subs were kicked I had real pain in my wrist, I told him this and with no X-rays or anything I started getting  180 15mg Roxie's. I was easy and perfect. I have since moved far away and quit everything, but those were the days. A friend of mine facebooked me a pic from news day and there he was on the cover, arrested and charged. What he was doing was dangerous but I knew the risks and didn't mind at all. He was a really cool guy to me and it's sad to see him go down like that, but also very sad for the victims family. You play with fire and you get burned. He did easily prescribe, but you can also eat a pound of salt and die, so that that mean the cashier that rung you up is at fault? It was PROBLY a mistake made by the person who prolly didn't mind the over prescribing at the time in which he was prescribed. I feel horrible for the victims family but you should always use responsibly.

I wrote up a huge long winded post that included a lot of my life story about how i got into opiates, the shit i went through ETC ETC ETC and i lost it...

SO here is the short and sweet as i would appreciate timely responses...  Also i hope posting to this subreddit looking for help quitting opiates isnt a no no... Im aware of at least one other sub reddit that deals with opiate withdrawals and quitting... but this one seems to get a lot more ttaffic

Long story short... This will be my second time quitting opiates by choice, i have went without 2 or 3 times in the last year to 1.5 years but that was not by choice...

I have been a daily user since roughly say december 2014 but in october 2014 i was doing opiates say 4 nights a week...  from october 2014 to april 2015 i was only using opiates in the evenings... Then when i unfortunately got laid off in april and to top it off i found out my girlfriend was cheating on me in october(who i have a child with) was cheating on me (this is a VERY VERY long story and i could write a book on it, maybe ill save it for my in depth thread on my entire experience with opiates, getting on and off them..)... Not only with 1 guy but by april when i got laid off  i learned there was at least 2 guys... Later after we were long broken up i found out there was likely say 10 maybe 20 guys... and i also found out she was literally a prostitute for the last year or more of our ""relationship""... im not just saying that to imply she was a whore(which she was) but she honestly was a prostitute... She used that main sugar baby sugar daddy website... where most girls use it to find one man to be there financial supplier and they give them companionship (read: fuck them)... she used it for selling herself to multiple old men for money...  I personally have nothing against prostituion but im not cool with my life partner doing it....  And the icing on the cake is the guy she has moved into my house, the first guy i found out she was ""cheating on me with"" was the main client who bought her out... her sugar daddy... this is the guy she has living in my house ""raising my kid""...  Fuck her.. she has a myriad of mental illnesses (borderline personality disorder, anorexia, bulimia and bipolar to name a few) some of which i kinda suspected and foiund out shortly after we started dating.. the eating disorders that is... and i thought i could help her with that and i did...  Additionally when i found out about the second guy i couldnt even stand to look at her... and i think she felt the same way and she couldnt handle me knowing more truths about her... she called the cops and lied to them and told them i hit her... Because we both owned the house they couldnt make either of us leave but if they got called back one of us had too... obviously she was gunna call back so i opted to leaeve and havent been back since...  Anyways enough about that...

In april my daily use got to the point where i was starting my first dose of the day in the morning and going throughout the day... at this point i had found my sweet start of the day dose... 12 mg of hydromorphone plugged, 15 to 18 it i really wanted to escape my BS life and null my emotions. for the first many months i strictly used hydromorphone plugged... the first few times i sniffed it but after i got into pluggin it, that was all i did... for the most part in the beginning i would do redoses at 1 hr intervals, mostly 3mg or sometimes 6mg...  Once i started using in the morning and all day my total mg of hydromorphone (HM) went up a fair bit...  it was at this point when i would wake up sick and need a dose to make me functional for the day...

My habit was starting to get pretty expensive and i had tried heroin once before...  But the first time i tried H i was super super cautious and careful with it... based on a review of the H from the same dealer where the reviewer stated that him and his girlfriend got high off just 15 mg...  Looking back that person must have been a huge newb with no tolerance at all...  so i started super slow.. doing 10mg lines every 30-45 min... because my tolerance from hydromorphone was decent at this point i didnt get high from the H at all... it just made me not be sick... so for many months i just wrote off heroin as not being as good as hydromorphone..

Eventually i came across a deal on some H that was too good to pass up... plus it had really good reviews and a energy control test that looked great... so i took the plunge... This time knowing i had a decent tolerance i had more balls and i started with 100mg plugged i believe... I think i redosed another 50 mg within a hr plugged and man did i feel great!  this was the start of mixing heroin into my regular routine..  given that H lasts longer than hydromorphone my thoughts were i might be able to get by cheaper using H, but i still kept hydromorphone in the mix given that was still easy for me to get local.  Mixing H and hydromorphone is really nice too... I cant imagine what it would be like to IV both...  Plugging is pretty good route of administration but i imagine H plus HM IV would be godly.. 

Since last summer i have been using mostly H with hydromorphone mixed in and the odd time oxycodone... but given my late start to oxycodone i need rather large amounts to get a good high off it... and being that i need to start off with say 80 to 120 mg (id say at least 100mg) to get a good high it is rather expensive too...  It does last longer and it has a diff high that i do enjoy also (even more energetic, which a lot of ppl report, however i have found all opiates give me energy and motivation to get a lot of shit done) but with 80mg costing me at minimum 55 to 60 CAD im looking at 60 to 90 CAD to start the day... then redoses... Thats why i havent really got into oxy and have mainly just stuck to doing one big dose of it and maybe a few times redosing, never done a all day affair on just oxy... ill usually switch back over to hydromorphone or H if i do start the day with oxy..   for comparison i can get 30mg of hydromorphone for 50 to 60 CAD and if i start the day with 15 mg thats only 25 to 30 CAD... still friggin insane!  or with H i used to be able to start the day with 0.15 but now im around 0.2 if i have enough to allow for that... and with H prices at around 220 to 250 CAD (or higher!!) for single g's, that 0.2 is $44 to 50...  but since it lasts longer than hydro i think it works out similarly..

Anyways for my regular daily use... If i am just using hydromorphone i am now using about 60mg a day (i have jumped me redoses up to 8 to 12 mg on average, with less frequency, but sometimes i will even do a 20mg boost or start the day with 20-24... chasing that high i never seem to fully get any more 


So where i was at before my first quitting attempt in december 2015... using either 0.5g of heroin a day (plugged/sniffed) and if i had HM i would ad that into the mix on top of my 0.5g H...

I basically followed the thomas recipe to some degree and went cold turkey.... for the first 72 hrs...  Compared to my previous times without opiates for a number of days this time wasnt nearly as bad... I cant say if it was the thomas recipe or what...  The physical symptoms were not nearly as bad as the 2 times i went without when just using HM...  I know since HM is short acting and strong the withdrawal are similar.. hit hard and heavy and dont last too long... (i once not by choice was clean for 5 days and it was very intense physically but on day 5 i really started to feel better...

This time in december i barely had the shits, i was pretty sore all over and couldnt keep food down... but i wasnt puking and didnt have restless leg syndrome (not sure if the thomas recipe helped with that, i was eating bananas when i could for potassium) and i was able to get a decent amount of sleep as i had clonazepam...  The hardest part for me this last time was the feeling physically shitty and not being able to eat... also the anxiety and thinking that i could make it all go away with just taking an opiate... sidenote... i actually had some hydromorphone on me and oxy when i quit using... and initially did not use them...  I had my sons best interests to keep me strong.. i knew his mother wouldnt be a ideal figure in his life...

I made it 72 hours without using... it was rough mentally and some of the typical physical symptoms were rough too..  I was taking multivitamins, immodium and benzos during the day when needed and also for sleeping at night...  Anothe really interesting thing was i used meth on the first 2 days... there is a lot of controvery over using stimulants when withdrawing from opiates... in my experience the meth gave me energy to get shit done and not feel ""as bad""... not i would never reccomend doing meth without a benzo on hand, regardless of opiate detox or now...the way i first discovered that meth might help was that i was given some for free (i would never purchase it on my own) and i was doing it one day... and i noticed that i didnt get sick in the morning and i was quite well... i cant recall if i eventually got sick and needed opiates or if i just wanted to calm down from the meth...  But at any rate, rather than needing opiates within 10 min of waking up, i managed to not do any opiates until 2 pm...  So this got me thinking and i did a ton of research... now i know myself i would never ever get heavily into meth... i am just not a strictly stimulant kind of guy... so i wasnt worried about trading one drug problem for another...

After 72 hours with only having a few ""meal replacement drinks"" i was so out of energy... when i stood up i would get light headed and hear slight buzzing... i decided that i needed to eat... but i just couldnt do it... So i caved in and did what for me was a rather minor dose of hydromorphone... I plugged 6 mg,,,  This gave me the ability to eat and get some shit done... I had went out and bought mostly healthy groceries and easy to make stuff prior to starting my detox.  I made a really good smoothie and ate what i could... ill say though before i did this minor opiate dose during my detox... i probably read for like 10 hours about the potential implications of taking a opiate dose this far in to being clean and trying to figure out how far it would set me back... i was worried that it might set me back to day one...

I get a feeling it maybe set me back a day or two, but with not as intense withdrawals...

after going another 1.5 to 2 days clean i needed to be functional to look after my boy (I had taken a week off work and had his mom look after him that week) so i took 5 mg of oxy, maybe 10... this made me feel good enough to keep up with a little boy...  again i was worried about setting me back... but the way i figured i was literally taking 1/20 to 1/10 of a dose i would use so it probably wouldnt fuck me over...
irly 
I did the small 5-10 mg dose of oxy for about 2 days i think... I think on the last day i used the oxy 5mg i also did another 6mg hydromorphone plug and i had a major responsibility with my son to take him out to see the xmas train and i needed to have him on my shoulders for like 2 hours etc... i probably could have got away without it but it definitely helped... then i went clean... the next day i felt fairly crappy, but nothing like the first 3 days... that day at lunch my long overdue xanax arrived and after popping one of those i felt immensely better... By the next day i was really feeling a lot better... So overall i dont really think my few little opiate doses set me back all that much... i did my last dose of opiates to start with on sunday around 4pm... i was clean for 72 hours or a bit over (until wednesday at 8ish).  then clean for 48 hours and then two days of opiate dosing on a minor scale.. on monday i felt shitty but managed to go to work, after getting the xanax at noon it really helped.. by tuesday i was physically pretty damn good... just the mental side of things were still fucking with me..

I felt that i did pretty good for the first 72 hrs knowing i had opiates right next to me and i didnt do them... So all said and done i did my detox in 8 to 9 days with a few cheats in there.... 

I wonder if i hadnt cheated if i could have been done in 6 to 7... i had no experience going through a heroin detox/withdrawl prior to this but i went into it assuming it would last a lil longer than the 4-5 days hydromorphone withdrawals did... I was soo worried about the cheating but in the end i dont think it fucked me over too bad and it made me functional when i needed to be...

So i guess my question is... will i be able to utilize oxy neo / oxy op to maybe do minor doses to get me through the rough patches upcoming without possibly fucking myself over too much... the oxy neo would be 80 mg... now i am aware these things are a real bugger to get past the abuse proof nature of them... and the 5mg IR oxy were ideal for what i needed... its just that the damn 5,10,20 IR oxy are so damn expensive compared to even the oldschool crushable oxycontin.  I have about 50 mg of a crushed up 80mg oxycontin that i was planning to use in 5 to 10 mg doses if i need...

But i found a cheap source for 80mg oxy neo, which would really help as funds are tight...but i would ideally like to break them down into 5 to 10mg doses... from what i read if it is even possible to break the time release mechanism, it is quite a process... and the guides  i have read were aimed at snorting and IV of these things... perhaps the preparation for snorting would work for me being able to divy up smaller IR doses... Or can anyone explain to me how a oxyneo 80 mg works as intended...?  Does it initially release a certain dose... then x mg per hr after that??  If it was giving me lose doses over the duration of the pill that might be ok... But i am a bit worried about the duration of the pills and if them essentially making it a longer acting opiate might draw out my detox longer than i could without it... what about cutting the pills into halves or quarters... anyone have any idea what kind of dose i would expect with that and whether or not it would essentially be IR or just a time release on a smaller scale??

I say i could cut the 80mg oxy into 2 or 4 pieces and get say 20mg out of a quarter pill (with it giving me 5 to 10mg to start and then the remaining 10 to 15 over however many hours these things are supposed to last (8 hrs?) or would the cutting it reduced overall duration to say giving me 5 to 10 to start and the rest slowly over 5 hours??  Same quesiton about using a half a pill, perhaps it might work as 10-20mg to start and the remaining 20-30mg over X hrs.  I think that could be ok for me in a pinch?

Another few things to note for my upcoming detox is...


 - i should have at least a week to be a useless piece of bedridden shit lol
 - I will be planning to mostly use the thomas recipe for what i felt is necessary and have access too etc.. Multivitamins, immodium, bananas (potassium, restlessleg), hot baths/showers, 
 - I will stock up on healthy foods and easy to prep stuff, fruits for smoothies, yogurts, gatorades/powerades, meal replacement drinks, cereal, instant noodles and frozen peas... etc
 - i have valium, a lil bit of xanax, bromazepam, and soon some clonazepam (i know the longer action benzos are great for getting sleep thru the night, i found in the past xanax and lorazepam work to get to bed but i usually wake up after the effects ware off, klonopin worked great last time for sleep, valium should too but i am digging valium for daytime anxiety as well without sleep)
 - a bunch of 300mg gabapentin... i have heard this can work great for some ppl for dealing with physical withdrawls.. i was supposed to have some last time but it never ended up making it... hopefully it will do the magic others have reported it can do... and maybe i wont need cheater opiate doses.
 - Cocaine and maybe meth... I also one time when going thru withdrawls found that cocaine helped make me feel a lot better.... i seem to recall not as much as meth... but when i was doing the coke i was days into full blown withdrawals...  The times i used meth with 100% success was just a morning where i didnt need my 8am dose until i chose too at 2pm...wasnt getting sick just wanted to wind down from stims..  the last time i quit the meth was pretty decent on day 1 and 2... kept me energized and feeling  a bit better... i have read that some have said that if you arnt going to be able to sleep anyways you might as well do meth lol... i myself was able to sleep due to good benzos..
 - i also found last time that watching really good movies and tv shows really helped to get my mind off the shit i was going through... i suspect your favorite movies say from your childhood that have nostaglia associated with them would probably do well too... in particular the ones that really got my mind off it last time were ""Ant Man"" and ""Ex Machina""... Great movies!  got immersed in them and forgot i was sick!
 - i also have a lil bit of ketamine which i have read works good for some ppl... i have tried it and it does work but its temporary and im not too found of the ketamine experience alone..

If anyone else had any other tips, please share i would definitely appreciate them... And id really like to know about those oxy neo 80mg / OP

Thanks and have a good one everyone!

I'm in outpatient rehab and some days well have like 12 people in the room. The people seem to come and go with relapses and arrests but I've never seen a girl at the meeting. 

Also I think I heard a stat that more addicts are white females from the same background as me. That being middle class suburban kids who for the most part have there shit together. I'm currently clean now for only a month. Well I had some small one time relapses but got right back on my subs. I've made my way to NA meetings and they seem like 95% guys also. I'm Not looking for a relationship in recovery anyway but fuck it would be nice to see a female for once outside the very few at my pharmacy job.

When I did use the only time I ran into other users was at my pill dealers house he sold to like a 100 different people and it was common for 10 to be chilling getting high using before they went home. I would see girls here. But once I started doing dope I never once met another person my dude sells to it was always a fast hand off here's the money grab the dope and lets get the fuck out of the gettho. For all I know I could of been his only customer but seriously doubt it as he took selling like a job and was super professional. 

So I rambled like I do on every post. Like half is this is kinda me being like how do I meet some females who understand what it's like to do dope and I can talk to openly. I'm honestly pretty loney now and sobreity has me feeling like a 14 year old boy again. But half of this is honest curiosity. Is the opiate just mostly all dudes. Are the girls who use afraid to cop themselves and ask guys to do it for them. I'm sober now and plan on stating that way but fuck! I wish I could of met another opiate user that happened to be a girl. There's nothing that I would of loved more than to do a fat line of dope and just nod and cuddle. I did that with sober girls but I wanted a girl to be going through it too. I wish I had a heroin romance like in all the junkie movies even tho there so toxic it seems so great. ",1456553207.0

we live with his grandma who has alzheimer's and dementia. he did everything to take care of her. i am scared as fuck. she doesn't remember me when i come home from work. she keeps asking where he is. i don't know how to deal with her. i know how to feed her and make sure she takes her medicine. but beyond that i'm lost.

he caught the original charge two years ago when we were deepest into our addiction and stealing massive amounts of copper from his job. in reality we're fortunate to have not been caught with the true extent of what we took. i'm just wrapping up my nine months of outpatient treatment as a result of the same case. in a sense it's probably good. i got clean for the first time since eating a script of percs six years ago. i stayed completely sober for nine months (including my jail time) and we have been partying every other weekend now that my drug tests are less strict. the first thing he said after he told me his sentence was ""baby, please don't fucking od while i'm gone."" that killed me. i know that fear because it was my biggest one when i was locked up. getting a call that he was dead. this will be the longest he's been clean in fifteen years. he's been on subs for about four. he's never been truly sober. i hope he benefits from it. that we both do. 

i'm sorry this is rambling and pointless. i'm just kind of stunned still and trying not to lose a grip. i know a year isn't shit to a lot of people. but it feels like shit right now. and sadly i'm counting down until i can get high. i just hate this. i miss him.",1456545349.0
47sx69,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/47sx69/let_me_hear_from_you_functional_addicts_who_have/,111,https://redd.it/47sx69,DamiensLust,"Let me hear from you ""functional addicts"" who have your shit together!","Hello, this ended up being a little longer than intended so theres a tl;dr at the end-

So I've been in and out and in and out of heroin addiction for just over two years now, and certainly know that unless there were enormous changes in my life - mainly that I started using again with a LOT of money in the bank - that I'll never be a ""functional addict"". Every time I've started doing heroin again it becomes my only full time job, and EVERYTHING else falls to the wayside where it will be ""put on hold"" till it no longer exists, lest I manage to clean up in time to salvage it. I will invariably end up losing my job, as I just cannot ever bring myself to go to work when I'm dopesick, so obviously I'll end up choosing taking a sick day to try and hustle up some money to score, and inevitably I'll pull one too many of these and end up getting fired.

Any academics will soon suffer the same fate, but even when I'm not sick I find that I cannot intellectually function at a sufficient level to get the grades I'm accustomed to - even if I use little enough to stay relatively clear-headed, my work will be nowhere near the level it would be if I was sober, and obviously nodding out is not conducive to doing any kind of work at all. My social life seems to always be the last to suffer, but sooner or later I'll lose interest in socializing with non-using friends as I'll be too busy either nodding my ass off or looking for money, and recently I find I just cut myself off from them during periods of suing so that I don't get caught again and don't try to borrow money off of them. My interest in women as anything other than potential sources of money also very quickly falls to zero, and I've ended up indebted to family members and disappointing them more times than I care to remember. 

So as you can see for me when I go back to using, my entire life begins to fall apart sooner or later, and continues to degenerate until I get clean again or I have no semblance of my ""normal"" life left at all. Clearly, I'm the total opposite of a ""functional addict"", so those out there who are functioning addicts and have their shit together and keep it together despite being on opiates how do you guys do it? What are your lives like? What do you use and how much? What jobs do you have/what do you study? What are your relationships with friends, family & significant others' like? How long have you been functioning addicts with your shit together, and has it ever fallen apart but you've managed to reel it back in? I guess mainly I'm just wondering what your lives are like generally, since I've yet to meet a functional addict IRL - all the junkies are know are part of the typical ""druggie"" underclass. 

tl;dr To functioning addicts, how long have you been functioning addicts and what are your lives like? ",1456540801.0

But, hell, I'm not complaining. I love it. It gives me a buzz and fights my pain.

Well, except for this one thing that happens. It seems like, for some reason, if I don't take it basically as soon as I wake up, I don't get the buzz from it. Or, at least, I don't get as good of one. All other opiates and opioids I've taken buzz me no matter how late I take them after I wake up. Do I just have a weird biochemistry or is this psychological?

I can't really say it does that all the time, because today I woke up at around 10AM and couldn't cop any until a friend fronted me one around 4 today. I took some of it, and I'm buzzing, just not super strong. 

But, most of the time, I can't take it unless it's pretty soon after I wake up. HOWEVER, I also can't take it too soon after I wake up. If I'm still feeling groggy and zzz, I have to wait until I wake up moar.

Also, another thing that happens is I can only take one dose a day and get something out of it. If I don't zzz before I take some more, it won't buzz me. That's a double edged sword. On one hand, if I want to get another buzz or increase/enhance my current one, I can't. On the other hand, it helps me keep how much I take under control, and make it last longer. I think that's sort of a good thing.

You guys seem to have some good taste up in here. What are your favorite books? I haven't been reading much lately and one of my favorite things to do in my free time is to just get lost in a book. 

Doesn't have to just be drug related however, I do enjoy reading those. I like reading autobiographies about people's crazy lives and drug use, things like that. But I do enjoy a large range of subjects other examples are spiritual, crime/thrillers, medical related subjects, crazy old Hollywood stories, mob stories or even history. 

I just grabbed Angela's Ashes from the library. I've always thought the movie was fantastic and have been wanting to read the book for years.

4-Fluoro-Pethidin (ethyl 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-methylpiperidine-4-carboxylate)

4-Iodo-Pethidin (ethyl 4-(4-iodophenyl)-1-methylpiperidine-4-carboxylate)

These are medium-potency opioids (around 0.15), but they have the added bonus of acting as dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRI). Pretty sweet, don't you think? 

My second proposal would be

Propylketobemidone (1-[4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-yl]butan-1-one)

Methylketobemidone (1-[4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-yl]ethanone)

Both are analogues of Ketobemidone, an opioid that was very popular in several European countries but was discontinued because of it's high abuse potential and it's tendency to produce profound euphoria even when consumed orally.

Last but not least:

Nortilidine (ethyl (1R,2S)-2-(methylamino)-1-phenylcyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylate)

Has about the same potency as morphine, but the added bonus of acting as a DRI (dopamine reuptake inhibitor). The prodrug to it (Tilidine) is available in Germany and I can tell you it's one of the most enjoyable opioids I've ever had the privilege of trying. Awesome stuff.

To my knowledge none of these four substances are subject to international conventions.

You would do me a huge favor if you would kindly ask your favorite RC suppliers to consider adding those to their product line. RC Vendors in general, but particularly those that already stock RC opioids. They won't move unless they see there is a real demand. Thank you so much in advance.

Need to stop, was just too far. I've taken today (saturday) to induct on subs (2mg at 9am this morning). I've smoked a lot more weed than I usually do today (indica) and I've taken 12.5 mg valium in 2.5mg increments throughout the day. Been watching hydration and had one poop- more solid than not. Still pretty firm.

Honestly, I feel pretty decent right now. The early stage anxiety is usually what gets me and I think having Valium at my disposal this time is helpful. I like it a lot more than xanax so far, but maybe I'm just using super small doses as I am not accustomed to valium dosing. 

My goal is to get through tonight (hopefully with sleep) and see what tomorrow is like. Hoping to wake up feeling OK and take 1mg suboxone, maybe some Valium, but less weed and have an even better day. That would be the ideal. If I can do that tomorrow, I plan to stay clean Monday and beyond.

My only issue is Monday. I need to be better than okay for an important meeting that could cost me my job. So I have made the decision that if Sunday night I am feeling that I may experience some sort of hot flashes, dilated pupils, or any other tells, I will pick up a few pills for the meeting. I will do a small amount that will probably do nothing beyond stop these symptoms as I will still be blocked by the subs. I can then switch back to subs after the meeting to continue my detox and the small amount of oxy probably won't have set me back much.

Just wanted to post this so someone out there considering getting out of a similar situation might see that Day 1 really isn't awful as long as you take it easy and take care. I'll report on Day 2, but if it's downhill from here, I think I'll be okay this time.",1456627225.0

The second picture is them the exact same way just flipped over, notice how the pill on the right has all markings facing a different way.

I know everyone is different and reacts to subs differently - but I'm a pretty moderate/heavy h user (6 year habit) and I switched to Subs this past Tuesday... I've been taking 2 8mg strips in the morning but most days end up taking another half or full mid-afternoon in order to feel ok and do my job. Last night I gave into cravings and did a bundle (Nasal insufflation) - even though I had taken 3 subs that day- was actually able to feel it (not as much as normal but more than expected). My question is do I need to wait the  whole 20-24 hours (which is how long I usually wait when first switching to subs) to take my next sub? Or because of the long half life there is still bupe in my receptors and so there is no risk of PW? I am only worried because I was able to feel the dope some does that mean it somehow took over the bupe in my receptors (even though I thought bupe is way stronger in that situation)? Anyone have experience they can share - I am finding so many mixed reviews on the answer and really don't want to have to worry about PW but need to keep going on the subs.

That said, I have a lot more to go on than most people who post these questions and I've never been so confounded trying to identify a drug in my entire life.

My opiate DOC when I was getting high was fentanyl & fentanylogues so I'm hoping to call on all you guys who have more dope experience than I do.

FACTS:
- I picked up the ""opium"" in question from a dealer that I know quite well and have known going on two years now; he assured me it wasn't heroin and compared it side-by-side with the tar and #4 he had stashed as well as comparing the used tinfoils he had from the ""opium"" and heroin. We have a good relationship and I've never known him to lie about his product. I test the shit out everything I buy regardless of source and I've bought a lot of stuff from him. Before you say that opium is pretty much impossible to get in the US bear in mind that he gets a lot of product shipped directly to him from Pakistan.

- It was 60 bucks for .4g, and is a brown powder, looking very similar to Euro #3 sourced from Afghanistan and Pakistan or to ""gunpowder"" heroin. If you breathe on it for a while, it ends up looking like tar, but has not rehydrated yet when left out & exposed to air for roughly 18 hours. Note that the price may not be a good metric because he sells to me a steep discount due to an arrangement we made last summer. (75¢ 1mg alp footballs <3) 

- Tar is the most readily available form of heroin in the area and bears a similar appearance to the rehydrated ""opium"", but #4 isn't rare either (though to my annoyance it's called China here) and is usually a similar powder consistency but more beige than brown. I live in a smaller metropolitan area in the great plains.

- If it's opium, it's the strongest opium I've ever gorram smoked. It didn't have me nodding but I didn't do a whole lot of it either, between .2-.3g with some waste because I'm horrible at smoking things. I've tapered down to 2mg a day of sub (from 8mg/day starting jan 3rd, prior to that going through 20-30mg of fentanyl hcl a day) and smoked it roughly 24 hours after my last dose of a sub, a 6mg dose. It blew through the sub with no problem and had me higher than I'd been in months, a nice euphoric sedation that sent me to bed an hour and a half after smoking it. I've have a couple grams of latex from the darkweb before and this stuff beats the hell out of it. It tasted flowery, stronger tasting but largely similar in profile to the darkweb opium latex I've had before.

- Noticeably absent was the sour, vinegar taste that the acetyl group in heroin produces. Note that I haven't smoked heroin before but I have smelled it being smoked on various occasions. 

- I tested it with marquis and mandelin reagents, both going to an opaque black within 30 seconds, consistent with opium.

- I tried making monkey water with it and the effects were impossible to differentiate from a placebo effect, sprayed a point up my nose with an oral syringe.

I'm safe when it comes down to it, as harm reduction is obviously important, and I rarely miss my shots. I still could use some advice, as I am having a few issues, outside of H domestically abusing me...

1. I do not save my cottons, but held on to the two I used today, as I am looking at a few days of withdrawal. Both were used to separately filter three bags of ECP. How do I go about getting something out of these? I have six scrapes in addition to these cottons, and hope it will be enough to get well.

2. I am having some issues with tying off. I register, untie, lose the register, and end up having to dig; it frustrates me enough that I won't bother to untie, though not often. Is there a better way to tie off? Is there something I could use to make this easier?

Some of you might recognize me from /r/drugs, where I've built a bit of a following with my short stories, many of which involve heroin. The following is my latest work, which some people recommended I share here.**


I’m sick. Not bed-bound, crying in a pool of sweat sick, but sick enough to know I fucked up. Another weekend binge has come and gone. I don’t know how many more of these I have in me. The Loperamide, which was once a miracle cure for withdrawal, is becoming less and less effective with each week. Monday through Thursday I pop ungodly amounts of the anti-diarrhea medication down my gullet on top of gallons of black coffee. On Fridays, I shit, if I’m lucky. 


Now it’s Monday morning. I went to bed early last night, at around 10, an hour after my last shot. It’s now 10 AM. I’ve slept for 12 hours, and I’m still exhausted. The sweats are starting, and my legs are beginning to rise from their slumber, ready to kick after 72 hours of inactivity. Every weekend binge gives me three days on the needle, which is just enough time for my body to become physically dependent again, right when I have to get back to work on Monday. I tried cutting down to just Fridays and Saturdays, but failed every time. Boredom is a motherfucker. 


I pop eight Loperamide pills, smoke a quick bowl, and get right the fuck back in bed. I have to work at three. I pant as I lay here and the sickness creeps in. My skin has a dry tightness to it that I can’t explain. No matter how much I squirm, toss, and turn, I cannot get comfortable. My saliva doesn’t even taste like my own. On top of all of this, I feel an overwhelming sense of dread and anxiety. My arms are lined with fresh tracks, all of which are beginning to bruise up badly. I have great veins for intravenous drug use, but sometimes I get sloppy. Apparently, I got very sloppy this weekend. The veins on the tops of my hands have been hit hard, and I can’t cover those with sleeves. Fuck, man…


My alarm clock jolts me awake again at 2 PM. Sweating and panting, I pop another eight Loperamide. This is not good. It’s fucking freezing, and the shower provides a brief few minutes of piping hot relief. I don’t wanna get out. I wanna die in this god damn shower. *“Why do I keep doing this shit?!”* I grit my teeth as I turn the water off and dry myself, shivering the whole time. I put on my goofy Wilson’s uniform, a sweatshirt, and a coat, and walk outside into the blistering cold. 


“Jesus fuckin’ Christ…” I sigh as I drive. I take my coat off at a red light. The hot and cold flashes are beginning to set in. Guess I’m gonna take more Loperamide. *“What the fuck am I doing, man?”* I grab a large coffee with a shot of espresso, knowing it’ll do fuck all for my condition. “How can I be this tired, after spending three nights and two days slumped in a computer chair, nodding in and out? How can my body forget how to function after a quick weekend vacation?” None of this makes sense, none of it is fair. Then again, what’d I expect fucking with this shit? 


I’ve got five minutes before I have to clock in. I choke down my coffee and burn the back of my throat. I put on my apron and clock in. I walk into the stockroom of the pharmacy to find a note from my manager and two pallets loaded with grocery items: 

*Harry: 


Jerry called in sick today, you’ll have to throw the whole load tonight. Watch the dairy section as well. Keep milk full, you can let the rest run. 


Thanks! 


-Ray*


Fuck. No Jerry means I won’t have to avoid my manager for two hours, but no Jerry means I actually have to *work* tonight. I toss cases of Cheez-Its, Oreos, and other shit nobody goes to a pharmacy to buy onto a dolly, working up a disgusting sweat the whole time. I put my knee up on my dolly and catch my breath, wishing I had banged in sick today too. 


“Harry!” 


“Huh?!?” I jump and jerk my head forward. Shit, it’s just Samantha. “Did I scare you!? Ahaha… Wow, you’re really breaking a sweat back here, huh?” She says as she walks into the stockroom. Samantha’s a good twenty years older than me, but loves her drugs. She’s been dropping not-so-subtle hints about this to me for the last two years we’ve worked together. Usually when a fellow addict or drunk starts working here I become fast friends with them, but Samantha talks too much and too loudly for my liking. “Jeez, it’s so cold out, how the Hell are you sweating so much?!” She asks playfully as I load up my dolly. “Hehe… I’m just a really hard worker, y’know?” Samantha laughs to herself and looks over her shoulder. “Well, a friend of mine has a bunch of Percocets she’s trying to get rid of, if you’re interested.” She says, lowering her voice. *“Haha, Percocet! Cute!”* “Sorry, not interested. Those aren’t really my thing, y’know?” I lie. “Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever you say Harry…” She replies as she walks away. 


Of course, every item I stock is on the bottom fucking shelf. A stinging pain shoots through my bicep as I put bags of salt and vinegar chips away. Fuck, I must’ve pinched a nerve or something tying off so many times. The sweating has finally subsided thanks to another dangerous dose of Lope, but the fatigue and bone-shivering chills are still in full effect. As break time nears, the sugar cravings kick in. I bring my dolly back to the stockroom and check my bank balance. $3.42 in my checking account, fuck. I recently made the minimum $25 payment on my Discover card, which I will max out once again when I get gas later. This is not good. I decide to check the dairy section before I head out on break and figure out how I’m gonna eat today. 


The dairy section of Wilson’s pharmacy is filled from a small cooler loaded with cases of milk and cheese. “Oh, fuck… God damn it, god damn it, god damn it!” I shout as I walk into the cooler. Working back here while dope sick is pure Hell. I quickly check the milk and orange juice, all of which are topped off nicely. Right before I leave, I notice a case of Rediwhip whipped cream sitting in the corner. There are no cameras in the dairy cooler, which is great for selling drugs and stealing shit. I close the cooler door and pull a can of Rediwhip out of the box. On the surface it looks like a mere confectionary topping, but to a junky like me, it’s a full meal. I call it the Junky Happy Meal because it’s sugary and sweet, and comes with a toy: nitrous oxide. I rip the top off the can, hold it straight up, and whip that shit. 

*WubWubWubWubWubWub!*

“Harry, this is Mike. He’s new, you’re training him tonight.” Jerry says to me. A skinny kid stands behind him with squinty, red eyes and a goofy smile. “What’s up, man? Mike.” He says, shaking my hand. “Harry. Nice to meet you, man.” “I’m taking off, just show him how to take calls, block the aisles, rotate, everything.” Jerry says. “See you later, Jerry.” Mike smells like weed, but then again, that could be the bag in my pocket. “I guess I can start by showing you how to fill the dairy cooler…” 


As we walk to the cooler, we pass Abe, an old Jamaican guy that mops the floors. I give him a nod and motion for him to follow me. Abe follows us inside and closes the door behind him. He looks at Mike and then looks at me, unsure. “He’s cool, man. You’re cool, right?” I ask Mike as I take a dub out of my pocket. Mike laughs. “Yeah, dude, I don’t give a fuck.” Abe hands me $20 and leaves. “You smoke?” I ask Mike. “Is this like a fucking test or something?” He asks me, laughing. “Nope. Just part of your training.” 


I don’t really give a fuck about training Mike. I’m more interested in making him a customer or connection or both. We go out into the parking lot and smoke a joint in my car. “Thanks, man… I like this job already, haha.” He says between coughs. “Hehe, no problem man. You ever need a bag lemme know. I’ll give you my number before I leave tonight. This job is boring as fuck but it’s an easy check. Not to mention it’s always good to have a paper trail…” I say, pulling my burner phone out of my pocket. Mike exhales and passes me the joint. 


“You just fuck with bud, or…?” 


“Nah man, I got Molly and acid by the sheet.” 


“Coke?” 


“I fuck around with it, I could never sell it, though. I’d fuckin do it all myself…” 


“Yeah dude, I’m the same way. You just sniff it, or…?” 


“Hehe, yeah. I don’t go *that* hard, man. But like, I don’t judge people like that. It’s just like… I have a hard enough time not rolling every fucking weekend, y’know? If I got into that needle shit… I’d be fucked.” 


“No, no, I totally get it. I can get you plays, though. I know mad people looking for that shit. Probably move a few sheets for you if it’s good shit.” 


“Word? Well I give out free half strip samples, so lemme know. I’ll toss you a little finder’s fee for your trouble.” 


“Word. I been out of work for the last like… two months, dude. Literally, all my money’s come from middling for people.” 


“Middling?”


***

 
Fucking hippie crack, man. Such a great high, I wish it’d stick around a little longer. I work through the entire case of whippits over the course of my shift, as a reward. I deserve it, after all, for rising above and beyond and working under such strenuous conditions. By six I’m done with everything and take an extended break. I’d be so fucked if I had a read job…


I come down from the break room an hour later to find Terry punching in. *“Jackpot!”* “Yo, what’s good?” He asks, dapping me up. “What’s up, man. You just coming in?” I ask him. “Yup, Lisa cut my fucking hours, I’m only here ‘till 11 tonight.” “Shit, that sucks. Yo, can you do me a huge favor?! I’m off at 11 too, but it’s fucking dead in here, I got all my shit done, you wanna swipe my card for me when you leave? I’m not feeling too good.” “Yeah dude, I got you.” Terry replies, smiling. “Thanks, dude. You’re a fucking saint, y’know that?” I say as I take my apron off and prepare to leave. Terry fishes around in his pockets and pulls out a 20. “You think you could get me a run tonight? I’m tryina get shitfaced when I get outta here.” *“This just gets better and better…”* “Sure man, what do you want?” “Just grab me a handle of cheap vodka, doesn’t matter what. My boy told me all vodka’s the same, whether it’s Rubinoff or Grey Goose.” I’m pretty sure that’s not true at all, but I don’t question Terry’s logic. “Sure, man. I’ll go grab that for you now, I’ll come back and you can stick it in your car or some shit.” 


I get sicker and sicker as I drive to the liquor store. The sweats are coming back, and the rest of my Lope is at home. I fuck with the heat and roll my window up and down, struggling in vain to find the perfect balance of hot and cold. My legs are growing restless, I hate driving when I’m in withdrawal, especially when I’m not on my way to or from my dealer’s place. 


A handle of Rubinoff costs me just over $12, allowing me to pocket $8. I can buy a Four Loko and get a couple of burgers off the dollar menu. Today wasn’t so bad after all, I guess. I hurry out of the liquor store and crack my watermelon Four Loko as I drive. Jesus Christ, I forgot how fucking awful these things tasted. The toxic malt liquor isn’t a miracle cure for withdrawals, but provides a decent distraction from the anxiety and sense of impending doom. 


“Thanks for doing this, man. I only got four more months of this shit before I’m finally 21.” Terry says when I drop the booze off to him. “Anytime, brotha.” Terry goes to leave but turns around again. “Oh yeah, where the fuck’s my change?” He asks. *“Shit!”* I have no idea what to say or do. I’m 24 and barely have $6 to my name. I reach into my pocket and pretend to look for cash. “Haha, it’s cool man, I’m just fucking around. What was the change? Like five bucks? Keep it, I don’t give a shit, dude.” Terry says, laughing. I sigh and pretend to laugh along. “Haha, thanks man. I appreciate it.” “That a Four Loko you got there?” Terry points to my cup holder. *“Oh fuck, I shoulda covered that up or something…”* “Haha, yeah, I haven’t had one of these in forever, y’know?” I stammer back. “Haha, word. Have a good night, man.” Terry says sarcastically, leaving before I can embarrass myself further. 


I light a smoke and gulp down the Four Loko as I drive home. The rest of the evening is spent drinking, watching Youtube videos, and browsing Reddit. Somewhere along the line I stumble onto a Trailer Park Boys Best Of compilation. God damn, I forgot how funny this fucking show was. I walk out to the living room and turn on the TV, ready to throw on some TPB on Netflix. I stumble around my living room looking for the Apple TV my grandmother got me last year for Christmas. Where the fuck did I…?

Ever fantasized about observing your own death aftermath?,"I don't know why. But I've been reading a lot about opiate overdoses and experiences on reddit. I've also been watching videos of people getting brought back with Narcan. 

Even though I'm only an occasional opiate user (at the moment), I've been obsessed with the thought of my own overdose. Along with that, I've been obsessing over how my friends would react (I know my family would be sad, but I'm unsure how my friends would feel). I keep wondering what they'd write about me on Facebook, or if they'll even write about me at all. The only thing stopping me from overdosing is the fact that I just won't exist anymore. I still want to live, but I just want to see how other's would react if I did die. Make any sense?

I've been seeing over the past few years of young people dying. No one I know, but usually friends of friends. Overdosing is the number #1 factor of young deaths around me with car accidents being #2. I sometimes check on the dead people's Facebook to see what they write about them. What wonderful things, such as ""This person was amazing, their soul shined bright, blah blah blah"" and it leaves me wondering if people would say the same thing about me. 

Idk, I'm just rambling here. But yeah, I really wish there was a way that I could die of an opiate over dose, see how people react, then turn back time and not do it and then continue to live on knowing who really cares about me. 

There's a tiny part of me that wants to tell my friends I'm suicidal (even though I'm not) to see how they react. But that might scare them away and make them think I'm batshit insane. And that's some petty shit that I used to do as a teenager and I don't want to be like a dumb teen me.

3. When I first started sniffing ECP, sniffing a whole 10 would have killed me. Now smoking, with a year tolerance break, I'm smoking a 10 and barely getting high. Is that just how tar is or am I getting shitty dope?

Any general tips and tricks for dealing with tar would be appreciated.",1456692067.0

Did a search but shit was conflicting. I have distilled white vinegar (says diluted to 5% acidity on the bottle) and a pack of Kool Aid. What should I do? 

Edit: Did a little white vinegar and a dash of Kool Aid with some sterile water. Did/didn't work out depending on how you look at it. Shot it with some tar, but I fucked up and did too much because I was led to believe that shooting crack was like half as potent as shooting powder, so I threw the whole dub in there. Thought I was gonna die, but I'm good now. No more crack for me. ",1456688907.0

a new one

that still smells like glue

with immaculate windows

unblinking

at a sky like the Sky Blue crayon I used when my skin was soft

and I was naive

before I carried a bag of dope in my breast pocket

because I didn't know so much about How It Works:

the love that would leave me flattened

the hearts I would trade for dopamine

the way we are all getting high

or coming down 

or dried up, skin cracking over right angle arteries

What's your favorite thing to do when you're nodding?

For me I like to:
*listen to music, like yung lean, cLOUDDEAD,  and Have A Nice Life
*talk about pills and h on reddit and 4chan(I bet you can relate, even when not nodding you don't like discussing such things, cuz then you'll just want em)
*play relaxed games, such as mount and blade and the long dark
*MEMES
*do other relaxed and stress free things. Nothing that takes a lot of concentration of course
*talk to people. I feel when I'm nodding, talking to people is just so much easier. The anxiety is gone and I can talk more without sounding like a jackass.

So what about you guys? Comment your favorite things to do when you're nodding and share ideas. Anything unique? I'd love to hear from all of you. 8)",1456681673.0
