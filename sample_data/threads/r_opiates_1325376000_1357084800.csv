o6f2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/o6f2p/opiate_vs_opioid/,10,https://redd.it/o6f2p,HelloChocolate,Opiate vs. Opioid,"I was curious as to why this subreddit, which deals with all Opioids, is called Opiates. To understand the difference between the two, I've quoted their definitions below:

Opiates (Wikipedia):

In medicine, the term opiate describes any of the narcotic opioid alkaloids found as natural products in the opium poppy plant.


Opioids (Handbook of Drug Interactions):

The term “opioid” applies to any substance, whether endogenous or synthetic, that produces morphine-like effects. Opiates are restricted to synthetic morphine-like drugs with non-peptidic structure. Opium is an extract of the juice of the poppy Papaver somniferum, which has been used socially and medicinally as early as 400 to 300 bc. In the early 1800s, morphine was isolated, and in the 1900s, its chemical structure was determined. Opium contains many alkaloids related to morphine. Many semisynthetic and fully synthetic compounds have been made and studied. The main groups of drugs include morphine analogues such as oxymorphone, codeine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin (diamorphine), and nalorphine, and the synthetic derivatives such as meperidine, fentanyl, methadone, propoxyphene, butor­phanol, pentazocine, diphenoxylate, and loperamide (Herz, A., Opioids Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, Vol. 104, Berlin, Springer Verlag, 1993).

Terminology (Wikipedia):


In the traditional sense, opiate has referred to only the alkaloids in opium and the natural and semi-synthetic derivatives of opium. The term is often incorrectly used to refer to all drugs with opium- or morphine-like pharmacological action, which are more properly classified under the broader terms opioid.



I can help but feel like there was a glaring oversight when it came to naming this subreddit. It makes it hard for outsiders, especially those in Health Care and other related fields to take this subreddit more seriously. I understand that it's the topics and level of activity that define a subreddit, not the name itself, but a name change would go a long way.

I have a decent job, and i've hid my habit from everyone except my dealer and a few close friends (i do a pretty good job of hiding any track marks too) I recently had to move back in with my parents (after living on my own for 6 years or so), and i'm currently depending on them heavily. 

I won some money about 2 months ago (a couple thousand) and no matter how hard i tried not to spend it (or not being a loser junkie and using it to move out again), i blew through it all and just spent the last of it on dope this past week.

when my dad asked to borrow a couple hundred bucks earlier this week, and i didnt have any left, it raised some big red flags about where it was going with him.

today i left for work, and since i get paid today i meant to bring my gear with me so i could score as soon as i'm out of work (i bought a bit of methadone mid-week so i wouldnt be sick until i got paid again, this is what i usually do, recently i've been lucky enough to not get too sick too often)

anyway like a fucking idiot i left my gear at the house and my fathe rjust called me at work informing me he found it. i didn't straight up admit my addiction, but i didn't deny it either, i just said i was at work and couldn't talk.

i hate myself for having to put him and  my mom through this. his best friend died when he was younger of an OD, and he's always told me, whatever i do just don't do heroin. i've failed him. 

i have no friends to turn to. no one to talk to. i don't know what to do.

right now my plan is to maybe leave work an hour early, go score for what is very probably my last time, maybe go to the theater and watch a movie by myself to be alone for a bit and enjoy my last high (though looking at the listings movies today really fucking suck, huh? i don't know how much i can enjoy any of these heh)..and then i dont know what's going to happen next.

he said he wanted to get me help on the phone.. there's a methadone clinic in my town but i don't have any insurance (and they only take insurance as payment). suboxone doctors take forever (and i hate suboxone, and again, i don't have insurance).. and i'm not going to a fucking detox/rehab no matter what, my mind is made up there.

i dont know what to do. i'm fucked. so fucked. 

i don't even have any friends to talk to about this. i'm afraid to go back home, but i don't want to leave my parents scared about what i'm doing when i don't come home later, but i'm afraid to face them. regardless i'll need to be alone for a little while, but after that, i am drawing a big blank. what is tomorrow going to be like?

i'm not ready to quit, but it looks like i have to. but how am i going to if i can't even afford the clinic?

i'm freaking out. maybe I should i just deny, deny, deny (even though there is overwhelming evidence against me)

Need some advice from those more experienced...,"Hey guys, throwaway account here for obvious reasons...I just need a little input/knowledge from some of the more experienced people here...

I've been addicted before, I went on about a 1 month bender, mostly roxy 30's, a few opana's, etc, by the end of my 30 day run I was insufflating about 120mg's of oxycodone per day.

Then one day I decided I was done with that shit, and was going to quit cold turkey.

The withdrawal from that was hell, I couldn't take it cold turkey, by day 2 I was having suicidal thoughts, etc, I decided instead of cold turkey I would wean off, so I weaned myself off slowly but surely, started a journal of every time I used, stopped snorting and started only taking oral doses, and after about 2 weeks was down to 1-2mg's per day starting from 60mg's per day or so.

The plan worked, I was sober and clean - Stayed clean for about 2 months.

Then, On newyears, I decided fuck it (bad idea I know) and picked up a bunch of roxy 30's...Basically, I've been hitting about 30-60mg's per day since new years night, I did take a 1 day break on jan 4th - all insufflated usage, no needles.

My supply is out, and instead of going to get more I'm stopping. I am curious though, do you guys think I will go through withdrawals?

I'm expecting some mild withdrawals, but do you guys think they will be that bad? I'm about to leave on a business trip for 1 week - so I won't be able to get any more opiates, I view this as a good thing as it will force me to stop - however, I have fairly good willlpower and I'm stopping now before things get out of hand...

..thankfully I have 1 8MG Suboxone pill, and 1 8MG Suboxone strip if I need it


tl;dr: Is 7 days of 30 to 60mg insufflated oxycodone per day enough time to become physically dependent? How long/bad will the withdrawal be? am I correct in thinking they should be fairly mild if at all?",1325988434.0

Joined Reddit not too long ago, found this sub yesterday, stoked about it. Didn't think i'd be writing anything ever, but decided to get stuff off my chest.


Anyways, settling into transition to suboxone which is always rough for me. The depression, lethargy, etc. I got a bit out of hand recently, and my habit has gotten the worst it's ever had. I came into some money over the holidays and started snorting up to 160mg of opana a day. I've been using for years, and started opana a few months ago. Everyone that's tried it knows that once you go opana, you can't go back. I used to do rox after the OPs came out because Opana got me sick, but because of costs, finally got to a point where I liked them. How bad is my habit compared to all of you guys?


Now my tolerance is fucked, I can't do anything else. Anyways, I'm out, and broke til payday, and am starting to sub. I hate this part, the first few days are the worst. Depressing, etc. I try not to take too much sub, I probably don't take enough to begin with, but I'd rather feel some WD and try a quick taper off the sub, because I know WD's off these are bad too.


Now I'm sure everone goes through this, but I'm going through the mental battle of if I should stop now. I definitely should for at least a while, because I need to get my tolerance down. But if I do that for long enough, I figure I should stop. But my closest friends use, and it's hard unless I cut them out, because let's be real - I'd rather not stop.


But these first few days are always a yo-yo for me. I feel so shitty that I get mad at myself for getting to this point. I'm depressed, tired, and right now would rather quit forever. But I know after subbing for a few days, that I'm going to want to use again. Especially on payday. 


Anyways, I don't even know what I'm getting at - it just feels good to vent. I guess, how do you know when it's time to quit? Hitting rock bottom is probably the only way, but I don't really want to do that. I don't know what I'm asking for here. Maybe I guess if anyone's at the same point as I am, and want to talk about it, shoot a reply.

Anyways, thanks for reading yall.",1326084073.0

Me just sitting randomly in my car in front of some persons house. 30 minutes later I call him to ask if I have time to run to McD's to take a piss. Says fine, I'll be there in 10. Go to McD's and back-took total of 2 minutes-park. See his car (friend told me what to look for) pull down block, go right past me. Stops at end. Calls me-""Yo I told you middle of the block. Out of the car now."" I get out, walk over, exchange, he says ""Call me"" and is out.
Double the price, 5x the quality.

But is this worth it? Am I right thinking sitting in a parked car for that long is bound to lead to trouble? Also, this town isn't known for much, I'd have no idea what to tell a cop I was doing there if one stopped to ask. Is this normal-do a lot of people have to put up with this?

I have been using roxy, oxy, hydros and opana for the last two years.  For my first year I would say I used about once every week or two and my tolerance was very low id say the 7.5s would give me a buzz back then and a 30 would absolutely rip me apart.  Then this year last june I got 100 roxy's at a crazy good price (stupidest decision ive ever made).  Because they were so available I just kept eating them and my tolerance sky rocketed.  By the end of September I was taking a minimum of 100mgs id say a day and I could handle up to 300 mgs.  I then went cold turkey and quit for exactly a month and a week the w/d wasn't as bad as i thought it would be, but it was pretty bad for about 3 days.  Then I started off again middle of october.  

I was up to about 100mgs a day in no time and now if i wanted to I could sniff 6 40mg opanas in a day and be fine its crazy.  I know its time to stop so on tuesday night i took my last line and stopped until tonight.  Id say i went about 40 hours.  It started with just hot flashes and cold sweats and just feeling miserable, but the cold sweats only lasted about 20 hours then more physical pain the sickness feeling.  Honestly by the time I used again tn the pain was bearable i felt as if i was getting close to getting thru the w/d, but wasn't sure,  But this time the w/d was at lesast 10 times as bad and I don't know how ill be able to get through it with out my close family and friends realizing whats up.  Keep in mind I have probably now used everyday with out skipping more then 5 days in the last three months I would say.  I would say on average a day I would consume about 120 mgs going all the way up to 400 I've possibly even gone higher.

Heres my main problem I'm going away to europe starting the beginning of February and even if i bring with me the longest it would last is a week so i need to stop.  

A friend has given me about 16mgs of suboxone I'm thinking about taking about 2mgs a day for the first few days then going cold turkey completely is this a good idea?

Any suggestions for getting thru the withdrawal.

It's not withdrawal keeping me awake, it's the state of my life and my joblessness and apprehension for the future (which can be directly attributed to my addiction to heroin.

It's been almost a year since i used opes (a short 3-week stint in feb that ended as abruptly as it started), and 2 since i kicked my gram-a-day addiction cold motherfuckin' turkey, and all I can think about right now is just how fantastic it would feel to cop some dope and take the edge off. i mean shit, it doesn't even have to BE dope.

i found this reddit last night along with 420 and silkroad and although i'm not exactly itching to get back on the wagon and spend a thousand a week, the convenience barriers of SR and legal deterrants of copping open-air are making me think I can dabble again and not fall off the deep end. Last february I came close but luckily I ran out of funding (the ultimate get-clean motivator). copping back then was much too convenient.

as soon as i have enough money in my bank account (.15 cents atm, thanks hospital bills!) I'm either A - getting bitcoins to safely and securely purchase a half gram of pure afghan (i know how to cut, i dealt back in the day) or B - buying poppy pods and fuckin' with some tea. Rant over.

P.S. I understand because of the wide spectrum of alkaloids in poppy tea, the withdrawalss are much more hellish than pharms or H.

I am so entirely thankful for the slap in the face my friends gave me which immediately lead me getting into an inpatient detox program at Cove Forge. I must thank my parents as well. Although they did not know of my addiction while it was going on I eventually broke the news to them while in rehab. They were very upset at first but understood I sought help on my own and they were willing to support me though this. A MILLION THANKS.THANKS ISNT ENOUGH!!! And that is why I'm here today. It is my turn to return the favor and help a friend! 

My very close friend has a terrible problem with Opanas.. or ANYTHING he can get his hands on thats going to give him that buzz. He has an extremely addictive personality as most of us 'addicts' do. Recently he spilled his guts to me and desperately wants help. Hates his life, realizes where he is headed, and wants to change direction for the better and live a life without opiates. 

I shared my detox/inpatient experience with him. It took about a month for me. I took a med leave, my employer paid the bill and continued paying me 80% of my normal pay! I am so thankful for this. My employer is seriously like a second family to me! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!! His employer would allow him to take some time off through hartford (I dont think jobs can legally fire you for a 'disease') however it would not be paid like mine and his insurance isn't the best. He doesn't want to take that time away from life and I don't blame him as I didn't want to either but my situation was a little better than his current one. 

I suggested Suboxone as an alternative as I know it can be a life saver.. but one does not want to switch from one drug to another... this is defeating the purpose of getting off the opiates. However I believe under the proper supervision and maintenance it could possibly be beneficial. I have no 'legal experience' with this type of maintenance so I cant say for certain. Ive only used Subs during dry times and like I said they were a life saver! 

So I went to suboxone.com and there are a bunch of local doctors around our area.. LIKE A BUNCH. PAGES! Within 10 miles! WOAH! **So my question is: What should he expect? His main concern is they are gonna think hes just a pill head looking for another high. The truth is hes addicted to illegally purchased/sold prescription drugs so I don't know if this makes a difference? What is the process? Does it matter if you were coming off a legal script or not? I'm guessing there's copay / insurance / background checks of sort possibly? I want to make sure I armed with accurate information from experienced people so I can tell him.**

I wanna be there for my friend like my friends where there for me. I want to say this tho: I will NOT lend him money. I will NOT find him drugs. I will NOT transport him anywhere unless its to the DR or REHAB. I want to help him and he wants help as well so here I am. Please do share with me.

My question ... first and foremost ... is this indeed safe to use while still using oc (about 80mg-160mg a day)?

I'm 23 and have been smoking weed since 16 occasionally and for the last few months I've been wondering whether I should try opiates or not. Haven't tried anything else besides N2O and THC, but I'm a heavy drinker, I think.

I have a history of depression, I suspect I have borderline personality disorder but my psychiatrist never shared diagnosis with me. Suicidal thoughts occur daily and I had 2 serious attempts about 2 years ago.

Question goes to pharmacology experts and experienced users: is it more risky (too risky?) for me to try opiates? Can I get a real thrill out of it or will it just fcuk my life up even more? Is it a good idea to look for happiness using opiates? Weed ""fixes"" me for 1-3 days usually, stabilizing mood, no suicidal thoughts, etc. Can you use opiates the same way? Can you study or work while on opiates?

Interested in any opinions. Thanks.

EDIT: a lot of you suggested to see my doctor instead and tell him I'm thinking of ""self medicating"" instead of jumping into this. I think this is what I will do. Thank you all for sharing your opinions, you helped a lot! You are a great community! :)",1327248958.0

This is an opiate throwaway account. I was posting from my regular reddit account for a few months, but decided to switch over...

Anyways, I decided, after watching my buddy boot for the past month, that I would finally take the dive. I've been fairly unsatisfied with insufflating D for a few weeks now, and tomorrow I'm going to a clinic to look into a maintenance program. Soo, I figured if I'm going to quit -- or at least significantly cut back -- I might as well go for the home run. Unfortunately, I took some methadone this morning, which I acquired from a buddy, and a tiny bit a few hours before the shot. 

I decided to go with one bag for the first time. I usually only sniff one bag at a time, but it's not long before I do another, and another...so I felt this would be appropriate, just in case I got sick, etc. I tied myself off with a belt, and my friend (regrettably) shot me up. I can't say I was too amazed with the rush -- I'm sure the fact that I took methadone had a lot to do with it. Also, the dope we got wasn't the usual banging shit we get (of course the guy gets back to us an hour or so after we settled with whatever we could find -- EVERYONE had their phone off, or was out, etc -- terrible night). 

I then went home, and about 2 hours after my first shot, did another one - this time with about 1.5 bags. Again, a fairly weak rush, but still not a bad high. Unfortunately, I'm feeling a bit queasy now, and I think it has a bit more to do with this type of dope, since I would get kind of dizzy/lightheaded from this guys stuff when sniffing it. 

So, I must admit, that I'm a bit disappointed to do my first boot when a) I took methadone that day/evening, and b) didn't hold out for the better shit to come around (but when you're fiending and no one's answering, you'll take anything!)

So, if I go on this maintenance program, maybe I'll skip a day or something if I decide I want to jump off that day, or if that fi-yah presents itself again.

Anyways, thanks for reading my rant. Hope I don't puke tonight, and hopefully I'll get to experience what everyone's talking about when they describe shooting dope, because I'm still not that impressed!

Also, I think I should read up on the ""safe shooting"" literature. I did browse it before, and have watched my friend -- he also helped me out, but the shot part I'm still a bit weary of. Probably something that I should have done PRIOR to shooting, but, in the heat of the moment...",1327642598.0

I just got done doing a fat shot and I decided to do a wash of what I had left in the spoon (I could still see a good bit of dope kinda caked on). So, I squirt about .6ml of water and suck it up through a cotton. Anyways, about 20mins later I remember I forgot to put it up (had been nodding out) and looking at the rig I can see two layers. It was laying longways and at the bottom was just super dark and at the top was wayyyyyy lighter than the bottom. Inbetween the two I could see some particles floating around.

 So, I figured I would refilter it and clogged a rig trying to do the cotton in the barrel thing. Then, I figured I would just squirt the rest back in a clean spoon and refilter it with a different cotton. Just about nothing got filtered out. Literally around 1% of the junk came out of the solution and it looked just as bad as it did before. I let it sit around for the same amount of time and I got the same result as I did before. 

 Basically, I'm wondering if a better way exist to filter BTH. I know about micron filters, but I can't afford them. Basically, the only way I can get them is ordering them online. I could afford them if I could actually buy single ones or a small pack, but I can only find them online. So, they really are not an option which fucking sucks.

The second two times I copped off him he was super late. I'd come into town, call and ask where the spot was today. He'd give me some street name in a ghetto area and tell me to park in the middle of the street and he'd be there in 5. First time he kept me waiting 30 min. No biggie. 2nd time, it was a little over an hour and a half.  I called 3 times and every time he said ""Yo, I'm coming, like a minute away, just chill.""

I fucking hate just sitting in my car sticking out like a sore thumb while waiting. I get so paranoid that I have to fight the urge to just drop the whole thing and drive home. 

So this time around, I call him and say ""I can be there by 11. Are you busy now? If so, tell me and I'll come some other time. If you're more than 15 min late, I'm leaving, and going back to my old guy.""

He assures me he will be right on time, and gives me a city name a few over from his and says to wait in the parking lot of the Stop&Shop. I was psyched, cuz this city was actually closer to me.
So I google map on my phone ""city name stop and shop,"" get directions, and am there by 10:55. 

At 11:01 he calls and says ""yo, where you at? I'm here and don't see you."" I say, ""Right accross from the pharmacy area."" He goes ""What the fuck man, ain't no pharmacy here! You at the wrong place! You at SUPER stop& shop."" So I google map it again, and it turns out there is a reg. stop and shop in the same city, but a different zip code, so it goes by a different name. It was 15 min away. 

I busted ass over to him and made it in 10. Jump in his car, hand him the cash, get the buns. He gives me the stinkiest eye ever and says ""my time is MONEY, yo. You on thin ice with me."" I get out, and he drives off.

A chick I met in Bmore at a gas station downtown about 9 months ago, young light-skinned with an Italian name/alias, sold me some blues at the gas station...she had attempted to jump-start this other dudes car and was unsuccessful and so I hopped in to help and she sold me some blues after some light conversation...bada bing bada boom... you know the deal.

So I call her last Sunday after not really speakin to her prob more than 3 times between 9 months ago and now (I had a cheaper connect and she could rarely match the price), and go up to her place to buy a couple blues.  Everything goes cool except got some confusion with the address she sent me to but it was no big deal.  

The second time I met up with her was that Tuesday.  She told me she had work til 6 and I could meet up with her afterwards to buy some dope, a 40 bag.  Now I'm new to dope so this means nothing to me...a '40 bag.'  After some research I learn this should get me at least .3 of some raw.  So I leave at around 6:10 and probably got to her area about 6:36pm....I call her and the conversation goes something like this:

Me: Yo I'm here

Her: Yo I'm not even there yet B thats why I told you not to leave yet

(This is true, she did tell me not to leave, although I had to see my weedman to whom isn't that far from her spot)

Me:  Yeah your right thats on me...how long til you'll be back

Her: Like real soon

Me:  Like how long

Her:15-20 min so you mind as well just wait

*(my spidy-senses are tingling...I have that sense...the scent...that foul smell of bullshit)

Me:  Are you sure? (major emphasis on 'sure')  I don't care if you tell me it will take an hour or even 2 or 3, but if you say 15-20 I'll wait, otherwise I'll come back later...so its 15-20 minutes right? You'll be here?

Her: Yeah B I got you, just wait there.

Me: alright I'll...(look down at phone and she's gone)

Fuckin bitch!!!!1 I thought...how dare she just hang up while im in mid sentence!?!  AHHHHHH!

I played the waiting game, texting and calling repeatedly, sometimes she'd answer sometimes I was ignored.  Ended up waiting an hour...just as I had predicted and told her I was trying to avoid since I had literally nothing to do and there wasn't really anything besides a mcdonald's nearby.  I was not happy... and the dope turned out to be mediocre at best - ""fire"" my ass...

So anyways, I call her tonight for some blues, which she will do a discount for at 3, so I ask for 3 at 11:45am today.  She says yea but I gotta come now.  So I left immediately, and get a call about 10 minutes later (I was halfway there) to turn around and she'll meet me when she gets back from church at 3.  Ughhhh Fine i say...I turn around and wait... Txt her at 3:40pm ""u gonna be back soon?""  Then it progressed as follows:

Her (3:40)- I'm on my way *(I'm #1 wit no runner up)

*Her signature lol at the end of every single text.

Me (3:41):  Hit me up when you're like 20 min away cause thats how long it should take me to get up there

Me (4:23)- u good?   (It was a short drive)

Her (4:26) - Ima hitchu when i get back

Me (4:26) - k

I call her about 2 hours later and ask her what the deal is, ready to tell her I'm going to just go elsewhere if its not soon (I'm not one to wait...I don't play those games) and she tells me 66 ain't shit, I got you blah blah blah b there soon...  wtf...I'm pissed at this point...she has no car and needs her mom for rides....66 ain't shit my ass...get a damn car then.  So after another round of unanswered texts and calls an hour and a half later, I send her this txt...

Me (6:25) -If gettin a ride is a problem I will give u a ride next time....u could walk home from glen bernie faster than this....just hit me up when you get home. makin sure you didn't forget.

At this point I met up with my other connect and sniffed some dope...feeling mistreated, and feeling like I had planet-sized balls, these texts followed...

Me (7:25) - U gotta tighten up ur game b....this shit is bad business.....if 66$ ain't shit then u must have plenty of cash to just buy a car.

Me (7:29) - It was 4 hrs ago u said u were on the way.  Just givin it to u straight.  I can b your most loyal customer as long as ur straight up and don't bullshit me.

She ends up callin me...""Hello?"" I say, she immediately starts with a very pissed off tone, tellin me ""who the fuck am I"" yada yada 'to tell her how to run her business""...luckily I said hello? again mid-sentence and she bought my pretending that I couldn't hear her...I ended up apologizing via text but I am afraid to meet up with her now....she at first just replied tellin me she had some ""boi"" which I guess is blow and then I asked if we were cool and she replied ""always""....I'm just a little nerv...not gonna lie.  She's kind of gully, kind of hot, and I definitely feel like she is capable of some shit based on how she carries herself in conversation.  We'll see...might just wait til tomorrow since I've already got off tonight and let her sleep on it just in case she's pissed.

tl;dr:  I'm going to see a pain-management doctor tomorrow, for my back (scoliosis and kyphosis), and I was wondering, what might I be able to tell him to persuade the prescription of opiates? Should I tell him about my past/current usage? Should I mention Suboxone treatment? Would it help having my mother there to verify this?

I would appreciate any info/insight. Thank you.

A little background info, which you don't have to read: 
I have been in mild-severe pain for nearly 4 years, and it has been influencing my sleep schedule, work and school performance. 3 years ago, I went to a specialist, and he had recommended corrective surgery, but, after discussing with a friend  who underwent the same surgery for nearly the identical back issues as mine, he said that some pain was still there, and, if anything, all the surgery had corrected was his posture. 
Roughly 4-5 months ago I have stopped going to physical therapy. I was going for maybe 6-8 months, and stopped predominately due to how costly it was, but also it wasn't giving me the relief that opiates were/are. I had also tried yoga, which can help time to time, but, wasn't much help either.
I have also dabbled in nearly every OTC NSAID, to pain relief gels (was prescribed Voltaren gel for my wrist), and had been prescribed Athrotec (since other NSAIDs were burning my stomach) -again, none of these have given me nearly enough relief as opiates. 
As far as opiate usage goes, I originally started about a year ago, for relief, but had gotten carried away, abusing them (predominantly snorting) up to the point of 7-8 roxicodones a day (roughly 210-240mg). I realized how severe the addiction was, so I went to suboxone treatment,  I was clean for roughly 3 weeks, and decided that it wasn't worth enduring the pain, and I'm currently up to 3-5 oxys (orally) a day.

Feel free to ask any questions, and, thank you in advance, and I await your input.

I never used opiates for recreation, just smoked weed. Then I got cancer, has surgery, and for over a year now, had chronic pain... in the worst possible area: my groin. It is a living nightmare. Before this ordeal I would never have thought about suicide, but to be frank, I think about it EVERY single day now. 

I have been taking norcos for over a year and sometimes had to BEG my doctors just to get pain relief. The fact that I have to do that makes me very depressed, and makes me feel like shit. I get treated like a scumbag, and all I want is my dick to stop hurting. Its a hilariously horrid situation.

If you take opiates for fun, just be prepared that one day, you may actually have pain... then what would you do? I had no tolerance so the meds work for me, but I just think of those that have a tolerance and how things would play out if they couldnt relieve the pain. I think that person would have pulled the plug long ago.

TL;DR: What I am trying to say is, its a dangerous game to play because one day you may actually need pain medication, and when you're already taking high doses for fun, what will you do when the pain is real? It's a sad situation that I have to advocate myself just to relieve pain because these medications get a bad rep, since they are abused so much. It makes it harder for those with real pain to get relief. Most become addicted and move on to hard street drugs like heroin. If I didn't care about y'all, I would never write this, but I want you all to know that you should consider these things when choosing to use opiates recreationally.

Fast forward to today.
I have ankylosing spondylitis and it hurts, i got prescribed oxycodone from my doc, before then i had gone about 2 years since my last opiate.

My doc prescribes me oxycodone 5mg about 120 at a time and schedules my next appt usualy 2 months away, this most recent time its 3 months, the bottle says every 4-6 hrs ect, this only lasts about 40 days.
 
My doc knows i use to abuse lortabs with apap, and that caused some noticeable effects that my doc caught, so i admitted to lortabs but not the 80's, which is the reason for oxycodone 5 with no apap,

How bad would it sound for me to ask for a higher strength dose.
When i first got prescribed id do 2 a day, now occasionally 4 a day but avg 3.

Ive been on oxy for a while now so ofc my tolerence has been built up.


**To sum things up, want to ask doc about upping my dose of oxy, and he knows of my past abusing lortabs.**

Anyone have any advice on how to go about this? I dont think he planned on daily use < he asked ""your not taking these every day right?"" And i lied and said no.",1328037860.0

Fact is, I'm pretty depressed right now, and when I sniff some H, it's the only time I feel right. Therefore, when it runs out, I find myself deeper in depression for a few days, with extreme anxiety, and needing way more of my valium script than usual.

I couldn't fall asleep until 7am last night despite taking first, at 10pm, a 3mg lunesta,  at 2 am, 2 30mg tamezepams, and at 5am, 20mg valium. I just rolled around, mind buzzing, back hurting, eyes tearing, fucking miserable. Normally, any one of the 3 would knock me out.

When I did wake up at 1pm, I was in a pool of cold sweat, my back is killing me, and I just want to lie in bed and feel sorry for myself.

It's such a struggle-opies are my only ticket to happiness in this current hell-hole of a situation I'm in, but they really do kick my ass on the come-down. This didn't happen the first 3 or 4 times I binged, it's just manifesting itself now.

Does anyone else feel like underlying depression exacerbates opiate come downs?

Finally, has anyone tried ULDNalextrone? It's supposed to be a cure for Endorphin Deficiency Syndrome, which I'm pretty sure is why opiates are the only thing that makes me function. 

I'm just at wit's end; my body is telling me the only thing that lets me escape once every 3 weeks is unacceptable.

Okay, so what if there was an island or even just a large area of the world where drugs were grown locally and distributed freely amongst societies members?  It would be a last stop place where you could freely join but could not leave.  Everyone would required to do the basics of being a human being and be required to report to doctors and/or group once a week.  There would be no responsibilities such as a job and child birth would be strictly prohibited.  Also you are allowed your doc in infinite quantities but if you decide to go sober or cheat you would be killed.  Scientists will be on hand to monitor this social experiment 24/7 and they are your bosses/masters whatever.  

Obviously this idea is ludicrous I'm sure scientists have enough info on the main drugs in this world and their effects, and funding for such a venture would probably only last a few years if that.  But what if?  Would you leave everyone behind for your DOC and no reponsibilities to goto such a place? And what do you think would happen?

Apparently there is a drug going through the FDA right now called MorphiDex, which is equal parts morphine and DXM, that is supposed to stop or greatly reduce the buildup of tolerance in pain management patients.

pc9fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/pc9fz/goodbye_my_love/,25,https://redd.it/pc9fz,LittleFucker,Goodbye my love...,"Its been the best of times and the worst of times... so i say goodbye, my love.  Its not worth the tears of loved ones, the strain on my body, the overdraft notices from my bank, the hobbies that haven't been nurtured...its not worth the responsibilities i've overlooked, having to wonder where i'd be if i never touched the stuff, and the depression that comes along with getting off the shit.  Its time to man up, and take the armor off.  There have been a lot of fun times over the past 8 years.  It started with the romance...the honeymoon with vicodin for my wisdom teeth...looking back its almost poetic, like all wisdom was ripped right out of my head at that moment.  I was in love...head over heels.  I found heaven in a pill.  Then oddly enough i discovered tramadol and the world of online pharmacies.  This is when i reached fiend status, and where my brain, under normal circumstances would have got the fuck out and never looked back...but alas, i was in way over my head.  Little did i know what the future had in store for me.

I began selling the tramadol, along with soma and weed throughout college.  I watched others get hooked which is something i will always feel guilty about.  One of my roommates had a problem i was unaware of when i first started selling to him, and within half a semester he went from 100mg to takin 750mg, 15 pills, to get high.  I had to cut him off, of course by then the damage was done and he knew where to get the shit himself.  I think it took having a seizure for him to realize he needed help.

The next flavor was codeine, online from new zealand.  Fiendin out took on new meaning.  I can remember days i would literally sit by the front door waiting for the mailman to come, running outside everytime i heard the hum of a diesel engine...like a dog waiting for his owner to get home...fucking pavlov.  The kitchen became my labratory, and i was doin a 24 pill (10/500) cwe just about every day.  Although i didnt introduce my roommates to the shit, i didnt mind being their supplier and assuming the risk of ordering scheduled narcotics online if it meant free drugs for me (this was the thinking in my drugged up mind).  Again, there will always be guilt for this.  

At this point i took a few weeks off, and spent a few days sick, and several weeks depressed and completely unable to sleep.  It had me, and i was miserable without it.  Then i saw something on the news while eating dinner with my parents that would change the course of my life forever.  I always knew baltimore had a pretty heavy opiate scene, but after seeing 'the wire' i was way too scared to ever fuck with it.  What i saw on the nightly news was a segment about the open air pharmacy that was lexington market.  They had busted people selling everything from suboxone to xanax to percocet.  Surely, i thought, none of that bad shit that happens in the projects of east and west baltimore would go down in a place like lex mark.  So the very next day i made the trip up, and within an hour of me turning the keys in the ignition, i had my hands on 10 5mg perc ir's at the low low price of 1$ a pop.  The progression of my addicition was slow...at this point it had been about 3-4 years and i could still get high on 20mg of percocet and either half or a full 350mg soma.  

From here the sky was the limit.  Copping shit off the street became part of the ritual that was getting high...it was all a rush...eveyday i was carrying out a secret mission...the pursuit of getting high. Eventually i got tired of this risk, and paying a little bit more to go to people i knew werent going to burn me or make me wait became standard procedure.  I went through a morphine phase for about 3 months right around the time i got laid off.  I have always been responsible as far as employment and never let getting high fuck that up.  Morphine was always ingested with a couple shots of vodka for what i referred to as laudanum.  It hit me hard, and the withdrawal was the worst i have ever experienced.  

I got to meet someone from this forum and that turned out much better than i thought it would.  Tried opana for the first time, which has always been a curiousity, and also saw someone shoot up for the first time, which i almost couldnt watch.  Be safe arnoldwhat.  You seem like you have a good heart and i wish u all the best in life.  If u ever decide to clean up you will always have a shoulder to lean on.

Tried dope a couple weeks ago.  Did it a few days in a row and truly hope that was it.  I always liked knowing my drugs were produced by people with phd's in white lab coats in a clean environment...as u all know, dope is a totally different ballgame. I also got some dilaudid last week which i havent had for at least 3 years.  I am going out with a bang, no pun intended as ive never used needles...all curiousities have been satisfied.  

I am very lucky to have people in my life who still support me through all of my lies and scumbaggery.  I am glad i never stole, and earned the money i used to buy drugs...i have enough guilt to deal with without thievery being on the list.  Most of all my parents and girlfriend.  We've been together 10 years and she's been my rock throughout this whole ordeal.  It would take 10 lifetimes to repay her, and i hope i can do the most i can in whatever time i have left on this earth.  Its just not worth the pain ive caused...i love her and my parents too much.  They don't deserve this.

So, even though it broke my ""no more than every 3 weeks"" rule by about a week, I was driving right through one of my pick up towns on my way back from a friends house on Monday night. I picked up 2 buns, and they are GARBAGE by themselves-it takes 5 to catch a nod-but if I take one benny along with sniffing one bag, I can nod on it.

I discovered this after going through 10 of them, and I have 2 left-so I've taken about 8 25mg dph pills in the last 24 hours. How bad is this for me? I haven't gotten delirious or anything yet, but it is definitely drying me out. 

 Also, I'm expecting my w/d to be a bit worse than usual since I used closer together-I've never tried Immodium before-is it really worth not shitting for an extra 3 days? I usually get by with Kratom and Valium, but I happen to be out of Bali Kratom, which is what I usually use/is most effective for w.d.

Edit-I also recently picked up a script for Seroquel for nights when I just CAN'T fall asleep. I know it is not at all recreational-but would it be good to try and just sleep thru my w/d?

Long time lurker & user, but this is my first post not only to this sub but to reddit at all. I'm a huge fan of this community and want to get to know you guys better & share in the conversation.

I've been sniffing those lovely blueberries for over three years now. I'm 21 and work in construction full time, and make a good paycheck (~$600 a week). After getting paid on Tuesday, I'm lucky to have any cash left by Friday, let alone for over the weekend. I get sick by 3 PM if I don't use at all, and it takes at least 60mg to get well at all, and to get any type of nod it takes me around 150-180 mg. I've gotten spoiled over the last year or so with a close friend getting a script for 180/month, and giving me 20-40 for free or close to it. Even that lasts me a week, if I'm lucky. 

I've gone through withdrawals a million times before - who hasn't. Sometimes for a day, sometimes for a week due to dried up sources. I've seen the prices go up, $5 now, $5 six months later. It's disgusting how much money I pay, hard earned money, just to not be sick each day. Only my friends who use know of my addiction, and 2-3 friends from highschool. Not even my girlfriend of 2 years knows. I've been confronted by my coworkers, my family, and my friends, and I've lied to them all. I've stolen from them all, just to get well for a day. I hate this lifestyle, and yet I can't imagine life without using. Every day I want to quit, but as the withdrawals set in, I can't help but go re-up. I've quit twice in the past, both times for over 4 weeks, and basically on my own. Each time I started out using Suboxone, then tapered down to where I needed nothing - you read right, NOTHING - in the matter of a month. But I've never been in this deep. The monkey has quite a hold of me, and I don't know how to shake it. I haven't used H yet, and I can't really find it unless I go to Hartford to cop, and being a small white boy, I don't fancy it, either. Besides, I can't even look at needles on TV, let alone use, so I'd be stuck sniffing/smoking what I got.

TL;DR is this. I'm wondering if anybody has had any success on tapering down from a 100mg+ daily intake to a 1-3 times a week chipping habit of <100mg for a good nod. I've just acquired myself 4 A215s and I tell myself this is my last time - how many times have I told myself that before? I've lost count.

Full disclosure notice: I am a member of NA and I feel like it has saved my life.  For YEARS the higher power thing kept me from thinking it was anything more than a cult.  I read the things some people in this sub-reddit say about NA and the higher power part and it's as if I'm reading something I wrote during my first rehab.  I used to feel EXACTLY the same way.  It took me forever to realize that spirituality != religion.  I'm not religious by a long-shot but I do consider myself spiritual.  For me that simply means living my life with honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness.


I am not promoting or telling anyone that the only way they will stay clean is through a 12-step program.  I know that is not the case.  I just wanted to post something that helped me in the beginning and might help someone else.  I feel like maybe if I had read this earlier on I might have saved myself from years of pain.  It's a reading from the blue book in the 'Our Members Share' section called Atheists Recover Too.


**Atheists Recover Too**

I grew up without a teaching of god. My father, though raised in a very devout family, renounced all faith in the religion he had been taught. I too couldn't believe that there was something out there that had some magical power to do the impossible; to defy the laws of physics. There were many things beyond my understanding, but to attribute them to a deity was, in my mind, just another way of avoiding the fear of the unknown. Too many people used god, or the devil, as it were, to deflect credit due or to avoid taking responsibility for their mistakes. I viewed the institution of religion as a means of controlling the masses, and I didn't want to be controlled. 


I made it my mission to refute this god in which other people believed and put their faith, but they resisted. In fact, in spite of all my efforts, I convinced not one person that they were wrong and that I was right. I just isolated myself all the more.


So, when I got clean I was apprehensive, to say the least. However, I was ready for a new way of life, so I just focused on today, and just for today I was on Step One. And there was no god in Step One. I got a sponsor who taught me about showing up and being dependable. He taught me about how to be available and not to be judgmental. He shared his experience and allowed me mine. The foundation of my recovery was laid in our relationship. I wanted what he had and was beginning to get it.


We moved on to Step Two, and it was time to cross the god bridge. I went on a quest to find a power greater than myself. I stepped out of my comfort zone and sought out people of both conventional and unconventional religious faiths. I opened my mind to what worked for others. I questioned, I listened, and I practiced. My search brought me to a number of different spiritual and religious groups, but I didn't find my place among any of them. What I was looking for was something quantifiable, something tangible to put on display... See this? This is what I believe. This is the god of my understanding.  Maybe if I could find that god, recovery would be easier. But that's not what I found. With no breakthroughs, feeling lost and dejected, I decided to approach Step Two another way. Perhaps the steps, the fellowship, service, and my sponsor would be enough to help me find recovery, without a god. 


Steps Three, Seven, and Eleven posed the greatest challenge because of their references to god and prayer. Steps Two and Six required some creative thinking as well. In practicing the Second Step, NA and the group became a power greater than me. By participating and being of service I was able to put the needs of the group and the suffering addict before my wants. My self-centeredness began to ease, and a restoration to sanity began to take place. I was right where I was supposed to be. I could see that my struggles weren't in vain, even when times were hard. I was experiencing life and growing as a result.


In the Third Step, I began turning my will and my life over to the process of recovery and to the spiritual principles that could be found in the steps. I was told to be honest about my belief, even if it was devoid of a god; otherwise the remaining steps would be of no value. I started to have faith in what recovery could offer me. With the strength and courage I found, I continued with the rest of the steps.


In Step Six, my defects of character were in the forefront of my mind. As I became more aware of their effects on my life, I tried to control my defects by suppressing them. The result was that they seemed to become worse, causing more harm, both to those close to me and to myself. I reached the place where I was entirely ready to be rid of my defects, and I moved on to Step Seven.


Believing that humility was an important aspect of the Seventh Step, I went to others for their experience. By earnestly seeking the experience of others, including those with whom I had little in common, I was performing acts of humility. I endeavored to live life by spiritual principles in order to relieve my shortcomings. Instead of merely trying to be rid of my shortcomings, I sought to replace them with something positive.


Step Eleven was a bit of a conundrum. ""I'm an atheist who believes in the power of prayer,"" I became known for saying. The statement, meant to shock people, became a conviction. Prayer wasn't getting on my knees and petitioning a deity. Rather, it was how I lived. As a prayer, all my decisions became important and relevant, regardless of how insignificant they might seem on the surface. I saw meditation as a tool or exercise to help expand my awareness. It helped to put me in the moment and to maintain my presence of mind throughout the day. 


The result was a spiritual awakening, a realization that I could stay clean, work the steps, be an upstanding member of Narcotics Anonymous, have a life worth living, and carry a message of recovery. All this was possible without a god. My initial fear of not being able to stay clean because I could not ""come to believe"" in a god had passed. I now had proof that it was possible, and the proof was in how I lived.


I have sponsored many people, some who struggle with believing in god and others who have a firm religious faith. Those who struggle find that they are not alone and are accepted as they are. Those with strong faith find that they too can share openly with me, and their beliefs are welcomed and accepted. Either way, my sponsees and I have the opportunity to grow together. I trust that what they come to believe has the power to help them, and they have the same trust in what I have come to believe. Sometimes we disagree on the particulars, but the particulars aren't what keep us clean. What keeps us clean is the choice that each of us makes not to pick up and to live this way of life to the best of our ability. 


This is a spiritual program, not a religious one. I try different approaches to working the steps. I still read and try to expand my knowledge on spiritual topics, and I constantly review my experience and contemplate its meaning in my life. This isn't to say that I don't question what I believe from time to time, or that I don't struggle, because I do. Life isn't always easy. Sometimes I feel alone during hard times. Believing in a god is alluring, because I know others find comfort there, but I do not. Today I do have a spiritual solution, however. The steps provide me with a framework for applying spiritual principles. Service acts as a conduit to relieve my self-centered thinking. The fellowship reminds me that I'm not alone, and my sponsor is a guide through the process. I continue to be a seeker. Anyone with a desire to stay clean can stay clean. ",1328815322.0

So I had a decently good friend (He's still alive, just NOT MY FRIEND ANYMORE) and I picked up a couple roxy 30's today because I like them and I,m slightly addicted to them.  HE asked me to front him some of my pills and I told him that I couldn't then he asks my I cant front him anymore, that he's always paid me back.. Sure he has always paid be back but the last time i loaned him some money to get pills I told him that I was going to need that money back by the time my rent was due in a week because it depended on it.. So come one week later he's giving me all these excuses everyday as to why its not his fault that he can't pay me back yet... Wither its his fault or not My rent CANNOT get paid now! So I had to go out and borrow money from someone, at a very high interest rate, in order to pay my rent.   and I keep messaging him about once a week asking where the hell my money is at? When he finally paid me back IN PILLS, not the money that I asked for, It took him a total of 3 months go pay me back.. 

So brings us to today I said if he could give me some money I had a friend that was willing to sell him a couple pills for his legitimate pain.  He asked me if I could loan him some money so he could buy the pills and I told him I had a couple pills for myself but not anymore money, which was a biiiig mistake because once he learned that I had pills on me he was like,""come on man give me the pills you know ill pay you back once I get my script on the 27th blah blah blah GIVE ME YOUR PILLS MAN COME ON!!"" is basically what he was saying to me.. I told him,"" Sorry man I cant afford to front you the pills i got FRONTED TO ME"" and he gave em a whole new barrage of new reasons why I should give him my pills.. and I told him these pills were fronted to me, I cant afford to wait until the 27th because the guy who fronted me is going to kick my ass NEXT WEEK if I don't have the money.  ( This being a VERY DIFFERENT THING then my rent were i would jsut acquire late fees, I am not willing to risk physical harm on the chance this guy might not have the money next week"" So then he sent me this text,"" Thanks I thought you was my friend, I paid you back the pilled I owed you...So if I end up dead its be because of you because My back and withdrawals are so bad, I', sure my parents will call everyone that I've talked to in the past few days""
 
TL;DR Had a friend I fronted $150 needed it back in one week didn't pay me back for 3 months.  Then today he found ou tI had a couple pills on me and So he's threatening to commit suicide if I don't give him my pills because it will be My fault if he decide's to kill him self because he's in so much pain OR because he thinks the withdrawals will be so bad it will kill him ( Even though he'd be in the same boat if he DIDN'T find out I had pills today

I am just ignoring his texts now because I don't really know what else to do!!! help me out fellow br/opies! If i don't have these pills I am going to be in one helllofa world of hurt myself :( I do have some legitimate back pain, but nothing I have gone to the doctor about yet I am self medicating until I can afford to fix it!

I flew into Michigan on Tuesday of this week. I had used up my entire stash the night before, so I was in heavy withdrawals by the time the plane touched down. We(mom and I) get a shuttle to the RDD office for preliminary tests and a psych evaluation. It took about 5 hours to see the doctor, which I'd say is about 30 days in junkie time. She could tell I was in withdrawal and gave me two 30mg roxys to ease the pain while we talked. After all the extensive tests and having the doctor explain the procedure, she gave me a prescription for seven more 30s to hold me over until the morning. They do not want you in withdrawal when you go into surgery. The next morning I woke at 4:30 to head to the hospital. They take everyone having the procedure in the same van, and in some fucked up way it felt good to see how much worse my situation could have been. Some of those people will never be the same physically, their arms literally had gorges in them. When we got to the hospital we were paired off into rooms and waited our turn. I talked to the guy in my room a bit, he was a nice fellow who was hooked on smoking opana, something I never tried. We shared stories for a bit and then it was my turn for the procedure. My immediate memories after that include being wheeled into the operating room and then waking up with a breathing tube still in my throat. Fuck. The rest of that day is a hellish daze enough in itself to keep me away from drugs for a long fucking time. On Thursday morning I was taken back to the hotel where my mom had to look after me for two days. They prescribed me a terrifyingly long list of medications for various side effects and complications, but luckily I haven't really needed them. Friday I was cleared to leave by the Doctor, and we flew out Saturday, not before missing our fucking flight though. 

Right now, I have been opiate free for four days, and I've realized that I DO NOT need them to live a full life. I don't even know what life really is, I've been in such a fucking dream(nightmare?) for nearly a third of my life that I never actually experienced a damn thing. My memory is shit, my body still feels like shit, and I'm pretty damn depressed. But I know my addictive personality can find an outlet that is not destructive to myself and those around me, so that's what I'm going to do. I won't criticize a damn soul for using, I know the opiates make all the decisions for you, but to those who are just starting to use for recreation, you need to fucking stop. No joke, if it becomes an everyday habit, you're fucked.

I have toyed with the idea in my head for awhile, and I know it is something I want to try. Problem is the people i do H with (friends, gf) are thoroughly opposed to shooting up. So I don't know who i can have babysit me. I usually do about .5 a day, a full g if i have nothing to do. So i was thinking of doing .1-.2 for my first shot. (since i don't have anyone else with me) 

I guess i am just kinda nervous about the process, i assume most people have someone shoot them up the first time. I've seen the process many a times, feel like i know what to do but am still kinda nervous just cause I would be alone in this journey. Idk I guess any tips, or encouraging words would be nice. If there is someone who wants to pm with me to make sure i have what i need to do down that'd be cool too.

TL;DR Going to be my first time shooting up ever and it will be alone. Thoughts or tips?

P.S. I have made up my mind i know the drawbacks and risks of taking this to the next level.",1329284748.0

I live in the south. We get tar, delivered to our local parking lots, by our local Mexican crew. So it used to be all good. We call, they show up sometime between instantly and an hour from then. Nothing special, we just show up and jump in their car.

Now the shit that's been going on lately is just....fuck. I'm just wondering if any of you can relate. I'm going to just start listing the ridiculousness:

* Getting through was always a bitch; now it's damn near impossible to get through. Nothing but voicemail, busy signals, and unanswered rings. I'm guessing because of how many people are always calling. A lot of times we're better off finding someone else waiting, and I have a great story about that.

* Speaking of other people waiting, it used to be just us. Recently they've been having upwards of 8 people meet at once. wtf? A convoy  of cars, with people jumping in and out.  Doing that is fucking sketch.

* The latest in the day I've ever bought dope from them is 6:30PM. The earliest is 9:20AM. Those are pretty decent hours. Lately they've been open from 10:30AM -12:PM. Better hope you don't have shit else to do if your an addict. An sometimes they show up with basically fucking NOTHING.

* I can understand not liking it when people call you up for 20's and making the 20's a little shitty, but when that's ALL YOU HAVE. A lot of times they have no halves or grams, just a fat bag of 30 of the shittiest twenties this side of the Mississippi. Imagine, oh, i don't know, a fucking grain of black sand.

* Sometimes they combine all this shit and meet 8 people with only a half and 2 20's on them.

Just, jesus christ, it's gotta be more than just a language barrier, there's some retarded shit going on.

But sometime's they're amazing. Huge sacks, there before I am. It's completely random.

Can anyone else relate?

I've been using good ol' Percocets habitually for around 6 months now. During those times, it's been a real love-hate relationship. The last time I dosed was 13 days ago.

I typically only dose a small amount, 10-20 mg. I admit that I've been rellying on them too much to cope with the mundane routine that I'm in. However, despite some of the harm I've done to myself, I really don't regret too much. Those early days where I would dose and feel at peace for hours were some of the most euphoric and stabilizing moments of my life. I take my good upbringing for granted and am thankful that I never had it too bad, but I never really felt satisfied before I was introduced to these little white pills.

I guess that wasn't really condensed, but I can talk for hours about this. My question for you guys is what do you think I should do with the last script that I got today?

 She has smoked dope about 4-5 times now and she wants to try plugging it. She'll be doing an enema before plugging if that affects the answer at all.

I'll do a little bit less than the figure I come up with to be safe, but I still need to know this info.

 If I don't get an answer I'll just give her half of what she would normally smoke. Just letting everyone know so that they know I will still practice harm reduction. Anyways, I've done some searching and I can't find an answer. So, if anybody knows I'd greatly appreciate it.

I'm having trouble navigating my personal opiate withdrawal ""timeline"". ","I've been using approximately 50 mgs of oxycodone approximately every other day for about 2 years. About a year ago, I developed an addiction to heroin which lasted for 6 months... I am currently 6 months off of heroin, but I can't seem to kick the oxy habit. A casual drug user throughout my teens, I have been taking percs and oxys fairly regularly for about 15 years. Up until about a year ago, I was able to dip in and out of using, my tolerance pretty consistently low, and withdrawals would occur rarely, if ever. But now, I can't seem to go more than 24 hours without experiencing bad physical withdrawal symptoms and its been taking its toll on my mental health, as well. During the onset of the physical aches, pains, and chills, I find that I'm often anxious and depressed. 

I did my last 30mg roxi 3 days ago and have been taking dihydrocodone pills (30mg tablets, an extremely low dosage as people can be prescribed up to 750mgs daily) intermittently throughout the day at the onset of sweats or chills. These cause some of the physical symptoms to lessen without getting me high. 

I'm really confused as to what is going on with my body: I didn't think I was on a high enough dose for my body to generate such a response to the discontinuation. I understand that the drug has been in my system fairly consistently for a long time, but the dosage has always been ""minimal"". I have been doing a good amount of research on opiate withdrawal and most people experience symptoms very similar to mine. However, the bulk of the posts I've been reading were written by users who were farther in the bag (mg. wise) than I am and I'm not sure why my symptoms are so severe. 

If anyone has ANY advice whatsoever, I would appreciate the help to shed some light on my problem. Right now, I'm having a hard time convincing myself that quitting is the right thing to do. I feel physically and mentally disoriented.

Here's another result with insulin and chitosan that has more on the delivery:

http://www.springerlink.com/content/qae2v7w1vq1t9jra/

After reading the study(abstract linked above) about morphine increasing the bioavailability of snorted morphine I became curious about how I could use chitosan personally. My current drug is morphine sulfate IR(so not the ms-contins) and I don't like injecting pills, so a 60% BA is very appealing. I purchased a large amount of chitosan capsules (265mg deacetylated chitin - 50mg aloe vera) from the Vitamin Shoppe. They contain a dusty brown powder.

This post is to discuss how best to use chitosan in combination with morphine. I am also curious as how to best use my current supply of chitosan. In the beginning I mixed the powder with warm water and sniffed a small amount of the liquid, making sure to coat the inside of my nose. I would then wait a minute for things to dry out, then snort my morphine. This *seemed* to be moderately effective. The main issues were that the mixture isn't portable, requires a source of water, is very uncomfortable to snort, and sometimes resulted in the nose becoming clogged(I assume from the morphine gelling upon contact with moisture from the chito-solution).

Recently I've just started mixing a small amount of chito powder with my morphine. This does not seem to be as effective, though it's much more convenient and does not clog the nose. It can be painful though and the chito seems to dust one's throat, which is uncomfortable. 

My questions are really about how to get the most effectiveness out of the chito. My main fear is that I'm not using enough of it (I think I only get about 20mgs with either method). I also am not sure my methods are the best. Anyways, I am curious if others use chito and if so, how do they. Is it effective?",1329971765.0

I am a 22yo male who weighs about 140lbs, and am also an experienced psychonaut and opioid user.  I suffer from an arthritic chronic pain condition, and was recently prescribed the new, atypical opioid analgesic Nucynta by my doctor for management of chronic pain.  Until last night, I had been taking this medication mostly as prescribed, and in fairly low doses.  Within the therapeutic range (50-150mg) I had been finding this medication to be a very effective analgesic, but not the most exciting of opioids.  

I had given a few pills to a friend of mine (another experienced opi user) who rectally took 150mgs, and reported getting some trippy visuals.  I thought this was weird, not having experienced anything of the sort, but was intrigued when he linked me to some bluelight/opi forums that reflected similar experiences by people who had taken Nucynta in excess of 300mgs.  We reflected on the similarity of the tapentadol chemical structure to that of certain phenethylamines, and pondered what effects shortening the aliphatic chain by one carbon or creating a para-substituted molecule might have on these purported psychedelic effects.    

By this point I was seriously intrigued by this novel molecule and decided I would take a strong dose and see what happened.  I was in no way prepared for the magnitude of the experience that would unfold, but I will attempt to recount it to the best of my abilities.  

**T+0:00)** I gave myself a subcutaneous injection (in the love handle) of 350mgs Tapentadol hydrochloride.  **[Again, this is a very high dose, and powerful ROA.  So don't do what I did.  I do not wish to be responsible for anyone getting hurt] ** 

T+0:15)  I begin feeling very warm, and a euphoric, but mild opioid rush hits me.  Here were those opioid effects I felt Nucynta had been lacking at the therapeutic range.  It is not long-lasting and the euphoria fades before long. 

T+0:45) I am feeling very warm, and lightheaded at this point... like I feel at lower doses, just more intense.  All of a sudden I feel a woosh and I feel like I am submerged into a deeper level of experience, beyond anything I have experienced before.  

T+1:00)  Looking around my room, staring at any given object causes it to look like it is vibrating or breathing.  The only thing I can compare this to is a come-up on shrooms when visual effects are starting to kick in.  I notice I am experiencing auditory hallucinations.  In the background of my consciousness is the continuous sound of muffled voices having a conversation, though I cannot make out what is being said.  

T+1:15) I go outside and look up at the stars.  Staring at any given star causes swirling, red, fractal-like patterns to form around it.  I realize that I am Fucked-UP.  

T+2:00) The aforementioned friend picks me up, and we head to a smoke spot to blaze.  I find that conversation is difficult, and I am having trouble focusing long enough to understand what my friend is saying.

T+2:15) We arrive at said smoke spot.  I had been taking a break from trees and have not smoked in 3 weeks.  I decide that I want to see what this drug is really all about, so I say fuck it, let's blaze.  We split three pipe bowls.  Things get a lot more intense, and I feel like I am having an intense trip.  This is far beyond anything I was expecting.       

T+3:00) My friend drops me off back at home.  I am feeling a bit overwhelmed and am not quite sure of everything going on so I decide to calm myself down by meditating.  

T+3:10) All hell breaks loose in my mind.  I do not wish to go into this any further, other than I had a lot of closed-eye visuals.   

T+5:40) Meditation did not succeed in making things less overwhelming, the opposite is true.  I go to bed.   

T+16:00) I write this trip report, and am still trying to grasp the gravity of what I experienced.    

The only way I can describe this drug at high doses is a mix of Oxycodone, Ketamine, and 2C-I.  Of any psychedelic I have experienced it is most similar to 2C-I.  

My experience with this drug was extremely powerful, and I would not say enjoyable is a great way to describe it at least in its later stages.  This however may stem from the fact that I was not mentally prepared for the gravity of this experience.

I wish to say a few words on my motivation for making this post, because I have a feeling I am going to take some flak from opiate users for it.  In no way am I advocating doing what I did.  However, in the way it is prescribed, it seems clear to me that the drug companies have no idea of just how powerful this little molecule is.  ",1330200974.0

Don’t let what anyone else thinks get you down on yourself.

I’ve seen your stories about families, relationships, businesses, and schools that you try your best for every day, and I know what amazing people all of you are.

q7mqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/q7mqo/after_8_years_of_use/,30,https://redd.it/q7mqo,BoyBreakSky,After 8 years of use...,"So after 8 years of opiate use, I've decided to cut out and live the clean side after a talk with my father, who was also an oxy addict for many years. After finding out that I was short on cash after receiving my $1028 tax return check, which I got 3 weeks ago, my dad started questioning me pretty hard about where all my money went knowing that I've had a roxy habit for quite some time. We had it out pretty good with him telling me that he was going to kick me out of the house. The next morning on the way to work (we work together) he told me that he wasn't going to kick me out because my mom wouldn't let him. She said she would rather have me die in her house than out on the streets. After a very sobering conversation on the 45 minute drive, which I was superbly high during, I decided now would be the best time to get my act together seeing as I want to save money to get a second street bike. I've tapered down the last few days on some 15's and tabs but I'm still in withdrawal mode.

A little background on my use. I started on 1-2 roxies a day by stealing them from my dad. He was getting so many pain killers for his back that he had no idea what to do with all of them or where they were going because he was so high and out of it the whole time. I eventually graduated to Herion when I was 17 and was on that until I was 21 when I decided to switch back to roxies because at the time they were more readily available. Now I'm 23 and I can see the damage that all this use has done to me. My current use is any where from 200mg to 400mg a day so the 5 tabs that I took about an hour ago are having barely any kind of affect on me. 

This has been a fun but very rocky road for me as I've fought with this addiction. I've done many things that I am not very proud of just to get high. I ""lost"" about $1500 worth of Heroin one day while driving my dealers stash to his new house for him. I had to beat another kid who owed him a lot of money to with in an inch of his life just to cover my own mistake. I've pawned things and sold things that were very valuable and dear to my family and myself just to get money. I've taken pay day loans out and have never paid them back. I'm not proud of the monster that these drugs have turned me into and it's time I get out of the cycle.

After I finish my shift tonight I'm going to stop and get a bunch of the OTC medications that are listed in the Withdrawal Survival Guide and I'm going to start getting my shit together. Wish me luck.

TL:DR - I've been using opiates for over 8 years and I've decided to get clean.

Day 2 - Horrible. Everything feels like its on fire. I slept like shit. None of the OTC meds are helping like everyone says they would.

Wow this subreddit has grown, good shit! I have a question, which has probably been answered before.. Somewhere.

I was wondering if there was some type of chart which shows the Affinity to receptors with multiple types of opiates, I ask as I will sometimes pop something a little stronger along with the usual pint of lean to give it a bit more oomph if I want to nod. 

Say for example I have read bupe has a very high affinity, and will kick most other opiates off the receptor (I understand them in the very loosest terms, my apologies if I'm stupifiying this) and can in turn cause precipitated withdrawal.

I guess I just want to know if I'm wasting these fancy pills which my connects don't often have when mixing with my opiate of choice (or any other opiate), or that in fact they are boosting my high substantially - They sure feel like it :P.

I found the bioavailability link very helpful, and seriously I dig this place much better than some drug forums reddit brings the science.

In a recent pharmacology class, I learned that there can actually be a pretty large difference in amount of active ingredient compared to the listed amount. With narcotics, that margin of error is a lot tighter--but there are definitely believers who see certain formulations of certain pharmaceuticals as stronger. Any information would be appreciated.

Here's my process

1. Buy 1lb of poppy seeds from amazon, I chose them because they looked unwashed from the picture. 

http://www.amazon.com/OliveNation-Whole-Black-Poppy-Seeds/dp/B005BSYQV0/ref=sr_1_26?ie=UTF8&qid=1330801949&sr=8-26

2. Use funnel to pour the entire pound of seeds into container such as a milk jug, 2 liter soda bottle, etc

3. Cover seeds with tap water so the water goes about 1/2 inch over the top of the seeds

4. Pour in about 2-4 oz of grapefruit juice or something that contains some sort of acid (Orange juice, apple juice, etc)

5. Set a timer for 10 mins

6. Place cap on bottle and shake the bottle vigorously. You don't have to be shaking the whole time, it's okay to take breaks. (The timer is set so you don't soak the seeds too long) 

7. When the timer is up unscrew the cap of the bottle just enough so that the liquid will come out but nothing else (or just pour through a coffee filter, t-shirt, cheesecloth, funnel with screen etc)

That's it, it's time to Consume! But start slow! You have no idea how strong the seeds could be. Drink some then wait a half hour or so and drink more. 

If all is well your tea should be a murky almost yellow color and it should be bitter tasting. The darker and more bitter tasting it is the stronger it is.

The taste is really not horrible though, it's nutty like a poppy seed bagel. Definitely a hell of a lot better tasting than kratom.

I'm a junky, through and through. My DOC is heroin. I've been using drugs since I was 12. I'm 24 now. I'm not even talking about weed or the lighter stuff. Coke, rx shit, etc. Grew up in Brooklyn. Not the worst part of town, but really far from ""good"". Most of my friends I grew up with are the same as me. Career drug addicts and criminals. Product of my environment? Maybe. I like to take responsibility for my actions, so I guess all that is my choice. I started shooting dope four years ago, but out of the last four years, I was able to.get 17 months clean with the help of a program.

So, that's my background. To the here and now.. 

I relapsed last year. I always thought, while clean, that if I relapse, the shame and personal guilt would kill me. Heh, nothing like that happened. I just kept banging dope. At home, at work, everywhere. I'm extremely functional. Most of my friends didn't even know I relapsed. I kept up appearances, did great at work. Just never had any money, because I had a two bundle a day habit. So since February of last year, I've kinda been derpin along, shooting massive amounts of heroin, and basically just getting by, by the skin of my teeth. To those of you who are chipping, I salute you for your responsible use. You achieved what I never could. For me, heroin is a way of life. Everything else is just a distraction. Dunno. Those 17 months of sobriety didn't really do much for me... And that's the longest time I had been clean in more than a decade. Sure, I had money (didn't know what to do with it), and ky parents trusted me more... But, I just wasn't happy. There wasn't any purpose to anything that I did. I discussed it in my groups often, and tries to work on it. I decided to get sober because at the time, my use spiralled out of control, and one day I overdosed at work. Now, I was sober and bored, which is probably the worst thing to someone in recovery. When I started using again, it just wasn't the same. I didn't have the same zeal... Couldn't go hard on it. Something would always hold me back from using with that same intensity. Don't get me wrong, I still blew all my cash on dope, but I subconsciously didn't wanna od, or look like shit... I don't know. Something. Basically, I think I didn't know what to do, and went back to doing what I knew best. A cautionary tale to someone in recovery, perhaps? Probably.

So, derpin along to January... I got tired of this lifestyle. I was living with my parents, forced to move back in with them after rehab. Anyone who's ever had their own place and had to move back in knows what a drag that is. So, I knew I had to get clean and step up my game at work so I could have my own place. Went to detox, got clean for a week, started using again. Rinse and repeat twice. Then I said fuckit. I knew I had to feel the pain, went to upstate new York and kicked my habit (up to  30 bags daily by now) cold turkey. Man, that was rough... Laying there, 90+ hours awake, listening to the cold wind howling outside... Shudder. When I went back to Brooklyn, I broke. Started using again. By this time, I had no job, and couldn't use a lot. Felt like an asshole, cause I just went through that pain, and decided to throw all that away. On the other hand, it was me who picked up the phone and called the man... I know, I'm rambling. Sorry.

At the end of January, I got a ridiculous opportunity for a huge score. Without getting into details, I came up on ten grand. Cash. Grabbed sixty bags and decided that I was gonna do something with my life. Traveled across the north eastern united states. Also figured that this could help me start over, get away from my dealers and ""friends"" in Brooklyn. Wound up running out in Indianapolis. Got sick, and all my well laid plans went out the window. Tried hard to score in town, but I swear to god, that place is square as shit. Wound up getting a gram and a half of tar from SR. Being used to reeally high quality Ny dope, it lasted me two days. I was also burning through money ridiculously quick. I never learned how to budget. To me, money is nothing. All those years of using, I learned how to get by on very little, cause that's all I would have after supporting my habit. So.. it was cold as shit in Indianapolis, and on a whim I decided to go south. Looked on Google maps and decided that I'm going to land in new orleans. So here I am. I managed to secure housing, ten minutes away from the French Quarter. So I got there, sick as shit. Found dope within a half hour of getting off the bus. Thank god for the homeless. It was STUPID expensive, and total shit, so I blew the last of my money, getting high all week long. 

So, here I am. I got no cash, but I found a job. Didn't like that job cause it was too far away, so I found ANOTHER job, within the same week, right in the French Quarter. What recession? Functional, I told ya ;) 

I'm gonna be alright. Surviving is what I do. The problem is, I don't wanna survive, I wanna live comfortably. If I stop shooting dope, I got this motherfucker in the bag, but the problem is... I dunno if I'll be happy doing that. I don't really wanna stop. Bad case of asshole disease, the ol' I want to have my cake and eat the motherfucker too. Anyone else ever been in this situation? Maybe its just time to grow up, bit dammit, I don't wanna :)

If you're still reading this, thanks a lot. I haven't really made friends here yet, and I needed to get this off my chest. I have some cold turkey to go through, but it shouldn't be too bad. 3-5 days of hell, but I'm a big boy, and big boys don't cry right? Also, I'm totally aware that I sounded like a total asshole jerkoff in some places, but I'm not sorry! Honesty is the best policy.

(just for mboxes though..although I have heard that there are fake a's and k-9's, never came across those yet.. ) and this only happens when my normal people are out, and I have to go through someone or go to a new person. 

- the fake mboxes side by side with real ones are a tad thicker. 
- real mboxes turn a little bit light blue when you lick them 
- of course real 30's taste like Percocet- licking them or tasting the drip.
- I've heard but not noticed that the 3 on the fake pill looks like a mcdonalds m sideways. 
- fakes are usually made from chalk or baby powder, so they'd be tasteless. 
- EDIT : real mboxes have blue speckles, but they're sometimes very hard to see especially in bad lighting.

My family had a sort of ""intervention"" with me this morning, and I'll admit, part of me wanted this to happen. I read sometimes how people get more careless with their actions, hoping to get caught, as a way out of their addiction. I can't say I was careless on purpose, but I certainly let down my guard. 

I'm on a 60-120mg/day diet of 30mg ocs, sometimes more. Haven't gone a day without anything in months. I'm living week to week to support my habit, and this isn't where I wanted to be at my age. That being said, I'm not sure how I'm going to handle this. I'm definitely going to take this opportunity to take a break, to climb out of the hole I've dug myself (and it is deep). I plan on taking however much time off I need to get clean, and I have my family here to support me. They've caught me in a world of lies, and it was pretty rough hearing and seeing what I had done to them, after everything they had done to me. 

Even with all of that said, I'm not sure how long this will last. Opiates have been part of my life for almost four years. I feel like the addiction isn't just doing the drugs - it's making the calls, heading into town, waiting, the process of taking the drugs, and everything that has affiliated itself with them. I feel like I won't know what to do with myself when I've got nothing to do and money in my hand. 

It's Sunday morning. I planned on taking a trip into town and grabbing 2-3 pills. That isn't going to happen now. I feel really unsure of myself. As much as I sort of wanted this to happen, I feel like I'll be battling every minute to not use. Will I slip and take my first opportunity to go and grab something? Will I slip a day, a week, however long from now? I'm almost positive this isn't going to last forever, and I'm not sure how long I want it to last.

I did one line first and wait for 10 min and felt nothing so I did 2 more. Waited 15 min and decided to do one more.  30 minutes later a very nice buzz set in.

Shush now, I whisper with my hands.
She wears nothing. She looks better that way. Her white, white skin reflects everything as I coax her from the forest. On her front she holds a single scar, an illustrious v, one that distinguishes her amongst many, but makes her lost amongst few. The scar isn't too noticable, it's only a little darker than she, and is almost flattering. 

I silently curse those who gave her such a beautiful mark.

Her hair is white, pale in comparison to her beautiful skin.

In the artificial light she looks almost yellow.

With a timid finger, I'm able to finally save her from the forest, which in any other case, would certainly have meant her death. 

Ignorance kills her, but I can't blame them. They're fearful.

Out of her orange forest she looks more pale than I remembered. Her ""v"" is more defined, and now I notice the slash cut horizontally on her back. ""For convenience"" I think quietly.

Out of her container, she's a little more timid. Her allure isn't as defined, and nerves are run tight. Past experience assures me, however, and I continue as planned.

I'm almost sweating now as she touches me hand. I've approached her, but now I'm terrified. Her skin is almost blinding this close, so white, so pure. 

""Lies."" I think. She is not pure. Her makers assured me of that. Inside her white euphoric veins lies a poison. It's common, yes, but it strikes slowly and brings down  even the strongest of men. It strikes at the sponge, the epicenter of purification. 

Wary, I double check my plan. Simple calculations occur in my head, and I look cautiously back at her forest. They made the math simple for me, the makers did.

I give in to temptation and embrace her. She smells of nothing, but her taste is bitter. I can feel her skin, smooth, yet still grainy, on my tongue. With each passing second I embrace more and more of her, until we are locked into a graceful dance. Consumption is quick, as always, and we fall back into a seat of anticipation and calm. 

The best is yet to come.

Within half an hour, I can feel the slightest trace of her infecting me. Slowly, this feeling builds, until finally I recognize it for what it is; warmth. Her gift is simple, yet extremely pleasing. My limbs slow down to her poison, and my arms stay still at my sides. 

Shes taking hold of me.

My legs go next. Like concrete, they set fast upon the ground, refusing even the thought of movement. Her toxin is filling me up. Was it only an hour ago that I saw her? 

A quick glance to the side assures me she is still there, looking eagerly up at me. Her white, unveiled eyes open up to me, allowing me the purest view into her soul. I'm hooked. Slowly, my brain is melted into those eyes, and replaced instead by a thought. This thought knows complexity, it knows my body, and takes control. My eyes register movement, but without the shade of opinion or emotion. My ears hear life, but without inhibition.

My tongue runs dryly over my teeth. It needs substance. One, two, three gulps of water satisfy my thirst, but something deeper growls from my taste buds. In response, the heavy thud of milk, and then the light dance and roll of bitter melt slowly over my hungry taste buds, who have grown restless. Sugar falls lightly and gracefully, filling in the gaps where the heavy thud of milk and dance of bitter have unsynchronized.

She is grabbing me again, pulling me into the full swing with her, throwing my arms around her waist and thrusting ravishingly. She runs her tongue down my stomach, down my abdomen, and then some. She sucks the life from me, sucks passion and care and worry. It feels incredible, and I hardly resist. She then pushes me down into a chair, and approaches me hungrily, kissing my nose lightly, and then my stomach again, and then a knee, and now a forearm. Everywhere she kisses a light itch arises, nothing worrisome, but more of pleasant thing that distracts the senses and helps me focus inward. She kisses again, this time with more force, and finally rests her lips on mine. I close my eyes in pure bliss.

Her eyes are open, and slowly staring into mine. She is absorbing all that I am, and regurgitation it through connected lips. Her white perky breasts press against my chest, but I feel no need motivation to play. The mere thought of the act is entertaining enough. She knows this, and she loves it. 

After hours of staring deeply into what is a white warm abyss, I feel the depart of her lips. In her wake, a fuzz shoots down my limbs and over my chest. It isn't visible, but it cushions my skin on my muscle, and massages my blood. 

She's leaving now, walking shamelessly naked around me. She is sapping my life force. Every now and then she'll kiss my nose or forearm again, and it will itch furiously. 

My lids are dropping, as more and more of her leaves me. She hardly touches me now, and a slow influx of emotion and opinion rush to replace her. 

I can't decide whether I miss her or not. I feel calm, relaxed, almost sleepy, and yet her intoxicating presence is still there, even though I feel and see no sight of her. I am still warm, and the the fuzz under my skin has now just barely diminished.

The lull of sleep calls me now, and I give in easily. She's always good about that, making sure to pay for my cab ride into sleeps ever changing suite.

Sometimes when I stand up too quickly or move too fast I feel her again. She's there for a fleeting second, then gone, teasing my senses and jolting me awake. I remove my clothes and climb shamelessly into bed, thinking of nothing but feeling everything. My brain has returned, and instead of interrogating me, it sits calmly and observes the scene of the body. It can deduce what it wants.  

Before losing myself, I get out of bed and check her forest, just out of curiosity. She's there again, staring lovingly up at me, the scar on her chest, and line cut across her back. I've already forgotten how oblong she is, yet how proportionate she is. White skin shines. I shake up her forest a little to rouse her, to count and to admire. 

Finally, the last tendrils of consciousness leave, and I escape to the warm breathing cotton of my sheets. ",1330983417.0

That I never intend to keep.
Empty parking lots,
And deserted streets.
Intentions are clear,
And plain for all to see,
If I wasn't the only one who cared.
Nerves on edge, and time crawls to a stop.
Waiting for her.
My true love, my mistress,
Who steals souls, and rapes the willing,
Training my eyes to spot her a mile away.
Butterflies in my stomach,
She's the only one,
Who can make me so apathetic.
I see myself through another's eyes,
For just a second,
For just a second, I see true despair,
I'm so pathetic.
I thought we were done,
Thought I had forgotten all about her,
As she's in my arms, my soul, my mind,
Like riding a bike,
I could never forget the way she makes me feel,
Happy and sad, all in one,
She only takes a point, to tell me I'm done,
I'm the dumb ass rat, crawling back to the trap,
Terror mixed with exhilaration,
Maybe I won't be so lucky next time,
Illness finds a hole in bliss.
She makes me sick,
As I hold her in my hands,
I feel sick,
As I pull her close.
Guts and Glory in the toilet bowl,
With her on the bed screaming ""Let's have another go"",
I give in, weakness rears it's ugly head.
I used to love her,
Said only nice things,
Now she's nothing more,
Than a whore I can use for the night,
And forget in the morning.
Picking myself off the strangest floor,
She'd left without a word,
Ways I'd rather keep it,
Things I would never change.
Maybe next time the trap will get me,
I feel like I'm playing Russian Roulette,
With a loaded gun.
Everyone's gotten off their high horse,
But I can't seem to stay off mine. ",1330978868.0

I have no recollection of writing any word of it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I glance over at the clock at the bottom right corner of my screen and notice that it's 4:56, ""haha,"" I thought to myself, it's close enough to 5 to leave for home. I tell Windows XP to shutdown and walk over to the sliding glass door in my office. It looks dreary outside, I can tell there's more bitter-cold wind that's been plaguing my valley for this past week. I walk back to the computer desk, backpack in hand and unzip the main compartment to begin methodically shoving various bits from my desk into it. The strong smell of home-grown chronic hits me like a brick. I forgot to seal the ziplock bag holding some bud I hastily threw in my bag earlier this morning. I quickly zip it shut and finish tearing down my station. Before getting ready to head out I quickly feel for the vial I carried all day. It's still in my left shirt pocket.

The commute home feels like it'll never end, as I weave through traffic I can hear the methodic 'tap tap tap' of a razor on glass in my mind. I love that sound. I've been trained to love it by every sort of crushable, snortable drug I've used. I manage to make it home in one piece, ignoring the retarded drivers, chilly wind, and the various potholes strewn throughout. I pull into the garage and dismount my motorcycle, throwing my gloves and helmet aside. After fumbling with the keys for a moment, I finally manage to unlock the only door between me and pure euphoria.

This moment has been on my mind all day long, the thought pops into my mind that I might be an addict but I cast it aside as I carefully setup my rectangular piece of glass on a black t-shirt, by the razor and crisp dollar from my wallet. I take off my backpack and throw it on the bed after taking my red Gatorade out. My hands are shaking with anticipation as I unbutton my shirt pocket to pull out my vial containing the very finest Cocaine I've ever had the privilege to rail. Grabbing a razor and a pen, I fabricate a makeshift tooter by cutting the pen's outer tube to size. For some unknown reason I always throw away my straws after each session and I refuse to snort with currency. Everything is ready now. I unscrew the cap and dump out enough for two pretty heavy lines on the pristine glass surface. I'm not sure if I can take them but oh well, ""you only live once"" or so they say. Slowly, I place the freshly crisped dollar over the pile and carefully run the razor over it. After lifting the dollar I start to chop chop chop the flat cake into many very fine particles. I scoop everything up into a pile and repeat this a few times until the whole lot is as fine as sea salt. The razor makes short work of the pile, and I had two enormous lines staring at me before I knew it.

My laptop is playing my favourite song from A Tribe Called Quest, the same song I play every time I get ready for some blow. My brain recognizes the typical rythmn and I notice that my mouth started watering minutes ago. ""I'm fucking pathetic,"" I say to myself as I grab the black pen tube and kneel over the first line. I exhale, pull the straw to my nose and point it at the end of the line. I begin inhaling and slowly drag my tooter over the line. It hits me instantly and I gag, but I didn't lose any powder. The line was probably too big, but I don't wait for the onset. I repeat the process on the second, equally sized line of marching powder and fall backwards on my bed and started grinding my teeth from the temporary nasal burn. It goes away shortly when the numbing sets in and I keep snorting deeply to get it all into my throat. I can feel the rush, that elusive, subtle euphoria that I spent every waking moment thinking about today. It's fucking beautiful.

I lay back in bed enjoying what seems like the finest moment in my life, nothing could ruin this. My sinus's start acting up so I reach my backpack to pop a few Benadryl.

The euphoria wears off after I listen to a selection of music I picked out earlier today so I put on some Deltron 3030 and start racking up a couple more lines. The powder is almost reflective, and this high is only an empty reminder of my encounters with Methamphetamine last month. I think this is the last time I buy coke, the last time I experience this.

My old drug of choice no longer satisfies me like meth does. That doesn't change the pile in front of me though. I can't resist blowing another two lines, half sized this time. They felt just as powerful as the first two. The numbing drip makes me gag again, despite my affinity for it. I have more of a love for the ritual of blowing lines than I do for blow itself.

I'm left sitting in my room, alone and geeked out, there's nobody to talk to so I guess that's why I'm here, to release this to like-minded people across the world.

I forgot to take a picture this morning but the pills were primarily transparent so it looked like the majority had dissolved. Surprisingly, the gelatenous shit was still a solid pill shape - just transparent. Weird.


Does anyone know how long these can sit? Do will they ever lose their effectiveness? I have left them for 12+ hours now. I'm gonna take them when I get home from work.

Perhaps one of the worst nights ever period, an unbelievable waste of time and money.  Disclaimer: this is a long story 

First off, I was on vacation away from my normal connects so I had no one to cop from.  Incidentally I had spoken to this redditor before about local open air spots and he contacted me to let me know he just got a new fire dope connect.

So I arranged to head out to him towards the evening, and repeatedly called him throughout the day to make sure that everything would be good with his dude when I got out there relatively late at night.  My experience with dope connects is that they generally stop serving after 8:00 or 8:30, so I was skeptical that this would even be possible.  My other boy then hit me up to say that i could get raw through his dude, but I didn't want to flake on the redditor so i declined that offer...

So I get out to this dude, and we then go out to scoop the girl with the connect.  I then learn that this girl is on house arrest, so even having her in the car is PC to search and just fucking stupid.  Anyway then we learn that her dude is all out and has been for several hours, but apparnetly there hasn't been any communication between redditor and her during the times i continually asked ""is it straight"". She says has other connects so it's still possible to cop, so it's not a problem.  At this point I would have rather dropped everyone off and gone home.

So we then drive far as hell to a gutter ass house to pick up another grimey bitch who has the connect.  So to not be a suspicious full car we drop the redditors off and me and these two girls i don't know are off to cop in the city.. Before even getting 10 feet the chick in the back is like ""can i smoke in your car"", and since it's a brand new car i was like ""no you can't smoke cigarettes"".  She replies ""Oh no it's not a cigarette"", so I am like ""no you defintiely can't smoke weed"".  

**""Oh no baby this ain't no weed, this that crack rock""** as she has her crack pipe loaded up and lighter in hand.  So now I have a bitch literally smoking crack in my backseat as we drive to the ghetto to score dope...

Ok so eventually we get to the city and we wait for 10 minutes parked in literally the worst neighborhood I ahve ever been in - all of hte houses are boarded up and there are open air dealers crawling hte streets and peering in the windows trying to sell us shit.  Finally the dude shows up and we cop and go back to the house to do the product. 

Oh yeah, the house where everyone was hanging out and shooting up was a former recovery house.  And it also had the power shut off, because the owner relapsed and didn't pay the bills.  So we get back there and all these kids are booting up by candlelight.  I sniff so i didn't give a shit, but i really wanted to get the fuck out of there.

Oh yeah, the crackhead apparently 'burned' someone earlier in the day at the recovery house, so she desperately needed a ride for her and her bf away from there.  I couldn't help her since my car was full, but she was pulling out all the stops.  ""I'll lay in the trunk, I'll lay on the ground, they won't see me, it won't be a problem."" blah blah.  eventually i just threw her an extra $10 to shut the fuck up and take a cab.

So i do the ""dope"", and it is by far the worst h i've ever done in my life.  The $10 scramble pills were like .3-.5 of powder, and probably .02-.05 of actual dope.  So you can imagine how much disgusting cut is in that.  Honestly like the most ignorant form of opiates i've ever encountered, just for really struggle people who can only scrounge up $10 to get a dialy shot type thing.

so i throw the redditor a $10 shot for ""hooking it up"", throw his friend 3/4 of a shot for free because he was broke and i didnt want to see him go sick (and because that wasn;t going to do anything to me anyways), and then throw that crackhead bitch $10 to not drive with 6 people in a tiny car.  

Drop everyone off, drive home, do the rest of what i copped, not even pinned.

**what a meet up!!!!!**

Just read that what I considered my ""safe"" cop spot is EXTREMELY hot.","So, I decided to get out while the getting was good, but when I did cop, it was either in Hartford or Waterbury. (CT) I am a paranoid android, safety while copping is my top priority. 

Even though the Diesel was way better in Waterbury, it was a typical drive all over the city/park and wait for 30+ minutes, scary homeboys, etc. I always felt lucky driving away unscathed. 

My connect in Hartford, which was a bit of a further drive and way lower quality (but half the price), was usually my first choice because:
A) He lived 2 minutes off a major highway
B) I called when getting off the exit, he never kept me waiting more than 2 minutes at the spot
C) Cop, get right back on highway and get the hell outta dodge.

I used to fantasize about trying some of that JerZ fire everyone raves about, but was way too paranoid hearing about all the different task forces out, and all the different traps they have set up on the roads out of P-town. 

Anyway, I was just looking at Stamp Reviews on BL, and someone reviewed a stamp, and the way he described it, I'm pretty much positive it's the same stuff and maybe even the same guy. (Described the color, texture, taste, even the packaging to the T of what I was getting.) He EXPLICITLY warned how extremely hot the area was, and how a lot of his friends had gotten popped recently, usually right after copping and before hopping back on the highway. Scarier still,  his post coincided with the timing of my runs up there.

I'm conflicted on whether  this guy was exaggerating, or if I dodged a major bullet. Anyone with insight on the area have any input?

Apparently he knows the owner of a pharmacy as well, and fills out all the prescriptions in one place. The kid was very coked out, and tried pushing some on to me. I told him I prefer opiates. He asked if I had ever done coke. I said yes and that opiates were just my drug of choice.  He repeated several times that if I had done enough I would not be able to feel my face. I had to respond by saying the lack of feeling was a feeling. He did't take well to this. Before the situation escalated I took my drugs, and left. Was pretty sketched out by this encounter, but at least now I know the source. Not sure how he gets the H and the Blow, but he kept saying ""come through to the hood I get you anything you need"".

I once went though precipitated withdrawal after a poor dosing decision after a recent opiate encounter.
Now, I am wondering, if I go though the PWD again, will this ""reset"" my brain away from the physical addiction? I am on spring break so this would be the best time to do this. I know PWD is hell, but it seems like it's the entire 2 week WD compressed into about 5 or 6 hours.
If I were to early dose suboxone tomorrow and enter this state, would it clear my brain from the physical dependence of opiates?
I CAN win the mental battle this time as the time ""just seems right for me"" but I don't have the 2 or 3 weeks to deal with cold turkey.
I have some Pepto, a couple of benzos, and am ready to be off this crap (I really can't aford to go to te doctor every month).
If any of you could shed some light on me as to whether or not this will be a 6 hour hell that's worth it, or if it will just be 6 hours of hell followed by 2 weeks of the regular shit, it'd be appreciated.

I have become a regular reader of this sub-reddit. Which is funny, because I'm not, nor will I ever be, a recreational opiate user. 

I've been surprised by how well-spoken many of you are. Its actually kind of debunked a lot of the junkie stereotypes that I didn't realize that I held. But on the other hand, its incredibly shocking to read about the hold that opiates have over many of you. I simply can't fathom ingesting, snorting, drinking, injecting some of the things that you do on a daily basis. From an outsiders perspective, there is literally nothing in my life that I put as much effort and time into as you folks do in the pursuit of your meds. 

I have to say the most disturbing thing about this sub-reddit is the advice and encouragement you give to people who are considering, but have yet to try, opiates. It just seems like such a potentially destructive and expensive addiction that it might be better to encourage potential users not to take it up. Although I suppose that if an individual is determined to try something - they'll likely do it regardless of the advice they get on the internet. 

So, in closing, I'd like to thank you all for the education. I believe that my time here has helped me to be more empathetic to the trials and tribulations of individuals who struggle with addiction and I will endeavour not to unfairly judge people based on the drugs that they choose to take. For what its worth, I'll do my part to continue to advocate for addictions supports within my community (e.g. needle exchange, safe injection sites, etc).

Most of this is just a whiny ass vent about things I needed off my chest involving being clean.

I've been clean for two months after ending, cold turkey, a 3 month Oxy binge. It started small, 15-30mg every other day, but by the end I was predictably up to 45-60mg a day. When I finally ran out, I had no money or desire to get more, mainly because I knew what was coming. the physical symptoms were surprisingly easy and quick to dissipate (The random shakes/RLS were mild and only lasted a week or so, and my insomnia has leveled off to what it was before my binge) and to be honest, I don't even really feel the need to go through the hassle of establishing a connection or spending rent money (all I have atm) on opiates, nice as it would be.

My one problem?

The fucking dreams. Which didn't even start until two weeks ago. Two or three times a week, I will have the most vivid dreams **I've ever had in my life**. And not just about getting high. They started out involving one of my best friends, and he would just show up to my apartment with a gallon ziplock half full of every kind of Oxy imaginable; dinky 5's and original OC 80's, even some I must have dreamed up, like gel-encapsulated ER Oxy 25's. Weird, right?

The past week it's progressed. Now I'm dreaming that I'm living in the house I grew up in with my mom (who died two years ago) and she's got the same fucking gallon ziplock as in the other series of dreams. The one I had this morning even ended with her offering me an OC60, and I remember my exact words were ""For real? For real and for true, you're giving this to me? Because I am *so fucking tired* of dreaming about you giving me oxy.""

I don't know what's worse; the fact that I've been having such realistic dreams that I wake up disappointed, or that my main concern in the dream **wasn't seeing my mother who's dead**. I don't know, I suppose I just needed to rant, and this all comes down to a question I have for the community;

r0myb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/r0myb/an_odd_thought_i_just_had/,18,https://redd.it/r0myb,vulpeszerda,An odd thought I just had.,"A little backstory: The two year anniversary of my dad's horrible motorcycle accident, mere weeks after I moved out of the country, is coming up in June. He fractured his skull, shatters his pelvis, broke most of his ribs, which punctured his kidney, lung and bladder, and his spine was messed up. He was put into an induced coma for a few days, then into rehab for about a year where he lost sight in one eye due to negligence from a staph infection. He cannot walk on his own, and was put back together very badly. He lives in an immense amount of pain now.

He recently asked his doctor to take him off of morphine because of how it makes him feel. He was on morphine and dilaudid. They kept him on dilaudid for breakthrough, and took the morphine off, replacing it with fentanyl patches, which he also doesn't like.

I just thought to myself, here is this man with more willpower than most people I know who would have probably killed themselves by now, trying his absolute hardest to not become addicted to the pain pills he has to take just to sleep at night or not pass out from the pain. It makes me feel very guilty when I complain about never having any connections, knowing he has so many opiates he takes that he doesn't want to take, and grudgingly forces them down. 

I actually had someone say to me, after learning about his accident and 'recovery', that he ""must be getting some dope ass drugs man, lucky"". 

Just an interesting perspective I've found myself in as an occasional recreational user. I'm not handling the guilt so well.",1331974396.0

r0ite,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/r0ite/thoughts_about_subox/,7,https://redd.it/r0ite,OpieTaylor,Thoughts about subox..,"Hi ya'll so I'm relatively new to this subreddit. What I like about is that for people who use opioids, there really is nothing IRL that serves to be a support group for those of us who know we'll likely never stop using, for whatever reason: be it pain management (physical, emotional), or liking the exhilaration of scoring and using, or like the euphoria, or insert whatever your reason here.. Sure, there are ton's of places that serve people who are trying to kick, and that's goodness. But if you think about it, there is so much stigma surrounding this lifestyle, that I think it tends to alienate people and has the effect of forcing them within. That's what I think is good about this place, for better or worse, its a place for people to share what they are up to, where in ""normal"" life, they might not feel comfortable. 

But that's not the reason I am posting this, that's an aside, an observation. What I came here to say is about subox. They say that you have to wait 24 hours to start, otherwise you will face horrific withdrawals, due to how the chemical binds with the different receptors in your brain. (Please don't ask me to say anything more than that, I had to stretch my mind big time just to force that little ""receptor"" nugget out of my head.)

I'm here to say that this wasn't true for me. I was on some pretty high doses of oxycontin (100-140mg daily). I was told DO NOT START EARLY or it will fuck your shit up. However, me being the adventurous guy I am, and realizing that either way I was going to be dealing with withdrawal, began using the subox after about 6 hours. The way I started was to literally put no more than a few grains on the tip of my finger and then under my tongue. Having felt no negative feelings, and indeed begun a feeling of calm, I waited another half hour and then dosed a bit more. Again, no increased withdrawals or agitiation, etc.. and a bit more improvement and feeling of being settled. 

And a bit more and a bit more, I continued this and by about 10 hours in, was up to .25. at which point I was free of the withdrawals, altogether. So in summary, **(TLDR) I was able to avoid withdrawal pain and agony,  by very carefully dosing myself with tiny amounts of subox, while still under the effects of oxycontin (having taken my last pill around 6 hours earlier).**

**EDIT:** I seem to be the anamoly here so please don't try this unless you know it will work for you.  ",1331963685.0

Thanks again

So, I'm horribly depressed and hungover today because of something incredibly stupid I did last night. 

My mom is house-sitting for some very, very rich people (10,000sq ft house-they have intercoms and elevators, etc), and last night, she was having her bridge group over to play. The homeowner actually encouraged her to use their ""casino room"" with her friends and gave her permission to eat/drink whatever she wanted.

She told me I could invite ONE friend over if I wanted, and not to get too drunk. I hardly drink anymore, as I hate the hangover, so I didn't think I'd have too much trouble.  Our plan was to watch the NCAA games in the movie theater and then shoot pool in the billiards room.
I brought a bottle of wine-he brought a bottle of Ouzo. One of the few varieties of hard liquor I enjoy. 

Fast forward to 11pm-my mom's guests were all gone, and she told me she was going to bed. One persistent friend had been texting me all night asking me what I was up to, and I was kind of ignoring him because I didn't want to admit that I didn't really trust him at this house. By 11:30, I was drunk enough to decide it was a good idea to text him the address and let him in the basement door-it WAS 4 floors down from my mom, she would never know.

Well, he got there, and I texted for him to come on in while I was shooting pool. He set off some beep on the alarm when he came in, and my mom came down to see if I had ran outside. She didn't immediately recognize my friend and let out a blood curdling scream. She stormed into the pool room, ordered me upstairs, and told me to get them out of their NOW. If they were drunk, pay for their taxi. (Which I did for my drunk friend, who prior to this incident had permission to crash on one of the couches.)

I woke up today so ashamed, I honestly wanted to die. I know some people have done much worse-stolen from family, etc. But when I'm not actively using (Been on sub for abt. a month now), I get REALLY, REALLY down on myself when I fuck up. Like, considering suicide down on myself. Considering copping again down on myself. (I resisted) Thinking how worthless I am down on myself. Really, really heavy shit.

 My mom trusted me enough to invite one friend over-and I went behind her back, and got popped. On the eve of my dad's birthday.

SO, the combo **tl; dr** and question of the post: Does shame sometimes drive you DEEPER into using/depression? For me, I feel like instead of being a motivating force for recovery, it actually makes me self destructive. How about you guys?

**TL; DR**: violated family's trust, got busted, considered both suicide and copping this morning. Shame wrecks me. You?

Suboxone/opiate experts only :D","hI, so sorry for the long post:

please read everything below carefull, as there are some important details included I think. Please help this junky get high just one more time with his true love (opiates) before he hangs it up for life. Not a binge, but just one single day. This is for closure for me. Please don't try to convince me not to, not in this thread anyway. If you can help with my request, I would really really appriciate it though. So....

Background: I was a daily opiate painkiller/heroin addict and IV user for many years. I started on suboxone maintenance 3 weeks ago. I take 8mg in the morning, and 8mg at night (16mg per day to keep the levels constant). The subs are great, I feel like a normal person, I can function at work and whatnot, and i'm not too depressed.

I also have some 1mg xanax pills i pop occasionally when i stress out.

Now as I understand it, subs have a 36 hours half life, and you can't really get high off full agonists when you're on suboxone (and remember I've been on for one month now without missing a dose). 

I was thinking of taking a day (or a couple if necessary to lower my sub/bupe levels if i have to) to get high just one more time before I quit for real. I plan to buy one item to get high with, use it, then go right back to the subs and commit to being sober full time. I just really want to get high one more time then I'm serious about quitting for good. I just need to get this out of the way for me. So my questions are (for anyone who has ever done this before, and I know many people have, but I can never get a straight answer, so please don't respond with a guess if you have never been on a daily suboxone maintenance program before (unless you can provide a reliable source somehow)

So my questions are:

1) How long should I wait before any optiates can ""break through"" the subs i've been taking daily for the last 3 weeks?... 12 hours? 24 hours? 36 houts? 72 hours? longer?

2) I have the choice between a few drugs I can try to get high with this one time, which one is more likely to ""punch through?"" the best/fastest? (KEEP IN MIND, I HAVE A COUPLE XANAX AND VALIUM I CAN USE WITH THEM TO HOPEFULLY HELP ""BREAKTHROUGH"" THE SUBOXONE: 

* Fentanyl - (i figure the strongst option and most likely to break through the suboxone in my system. It's a mylan Fentanyl 2.063 mg patch (12 mcg/h for 72 hours).. I guess I would smoke it or chew on it? (unless someone has a better method? I've only treied fent. once and it was a tiny peice of a lolipop  10 years ago before i ever even had an addiction. I remember it being fun though)

* Opana - A 40mg Opana pill. I've never tried opana before, and I really want to before I'm done with opiates for the rest of my life. I've heard their switching formulas soon, so i may never get to try an opana if i don't do it soon. Will opana be enough to break through the subs though? Also I don't know the best way to use opana.. (do you sniff them? IV them?)

* Dilaudid - much like opana, this is also one thing I never got the chance to try. I guess I would buy a few 8mg pills (or a bunch of 2mg's) and IV them just to expirience the infamous ""rush"" associated with them. Would a rush be possible? are they strong enough to break through (if even for a few minutes)? 

* Heroin - I've done heroin thousands of times, but the dope around here sucks. I have the opportunity to buy some raw (probably more potent than anything I've ever had)... I would IV it and hope that could break through the subs. Get one final nod, then back on the subs.


I've researched a ton of this, and I know suboxone blocks most opiates, but the 4 i mentioned above (fent, dillies, opana and raw heroin) I've read that some people have had luck getting high with if you take a day or two off from your suboxone.. moreso than other things like roxies or whatever.

3) This question is the one I'm having the most trouble finding... Let's say I take 2 days off from my subs (that i've been taking 16mg/day, every day for a month).. oviously i wouldn't be withdrawing because the subs have a 36 hour half life, so it would take at least a week before i actually started to feel withdrawals. .... but lets say i do get lucky and manage to get high after a two day break from subs. the high last  a couple hours. then By the next day, i wouldn't be high, but i'd still obviously have some bupe left in my system and i'd feel fine. 

If i take my next dose of suboxone the next day after getting high (say, 12-24 hours later).. i Wouldn't be withdrawing, as i'd still have a lot of bupe in my system.. would precipited withdrawals still be a concern? or could i just continue with my sub doses normally?

I know if you are dependent on full agonists, the cupe rips it out and puts you into PW.. but if you are depenent on bupe, and still have it in your system, and just ""broke through"" it one time with fent/op/dilly/dope.... in theory there's really nothing to rip out of your receptors by dosing with the bupe? or am i wrong, an i would have to wait like a week for all the bupe in my system to go through 6 half life cycles until i started to withdraw before i could continue? (i am mostly concerned because i need to just be normal and functioning at work and shit.. also i i have family counting my subs to make sure i take them. so the soon i can get back on them the better without raising any suspicions.. especially if they decide they want to see me take the pill in front of them. if i had to and just got high the day before, would i have to worry about precipitated withdrawal?)

sorry for the long post, but i've been looking everywhere for the answers to these questions and no one in real life or on the entire internet can seem to give me a straight answer on all this and guide me on how to ""take a short break from my subs for a day"" very well.

i know for a fact people do it (they call it the ""suboxone rollercoster"" of getting high, then back on subs, then get high, then back on subs.. like several times a week. how do i do it just once?

the only times I had good prescriptions my dad took them away from me because he didn't want me to abuse them (...sure...likely story...) but my real introduction was about a year ago. After a long night raving at Zeds Dead in PHX me and my partner decided it wasn't worth staying in PHX to drive home the next morning, and we were jacked enough on rowdy ecstacy pills to make it back that night. We drive through some sketchy conditions and about 20 miles out of FLG, full on blizzard conditions. We manage to make it home through the storm into a fresh foot of snow, I drop PaulWall off at his place then step over to the SkyKing's Lair to find two of my best friends who I had expected to be the only people possibly partying at this ungodly hour of 3am still partying; blacked out and nodding. I shoot the shit and drink myself closer to their level still pretty jacked on E, I notice some gnarly powder lined up on the table and am offered a line. At this point in the night, as long as it's not meth, I was down for anything, and I had deduced that whatever they were on was not an upper. My Bud who was most nodded out began cutting the line of this fine white substance and then completely nodded out with his hand on the razor still on the line. I had to make a bold decision at this point, seeing my friend nodded out in this position I would have to move him out of the way and try this mystery substance without any thought to possible repercussions. ""Am I really going to do this?"" I recall asking myself. yes. And I did. I then felt the warm blankets and the most furious rush of dope flushing through my brain. I was nodding in a matter of minutes. proceeded by some of the most violent dopesickness I've ever felt in my life. I puked about 5 times in the first 2 hours in between nodding out hard. I was woken up the next morning by violent dopesickness puking water not being able to hold anything down. my whole next day was spent wrestling the Dragon itself, nodding out with my bong in my hand on chat roulette (a favorite pastime whilst high). I found this mystery substance which I found out later to be Subutex, which is why it lacked the euphoric giggliness I have come to know and love. After such a violent introduction to opiates by buprenorphin I have managed to regulate my use. I prefer smoking Heroin, making Foil Art and can still get fucked up hard with a point or two. I see that, yes opiates change your brain chemistry, and if you don't have a strong will they can really ruin your shit, but if you can keep moderation in mind, the world of drugs and mind alteration can be an absolute blast.",1332354672.0

Should I use the same potentiators (grapefruit juice, DXM, dyphenhydramine) and avoid the same contradictions (Klonopin, beer, tons of other shit)?

I was curious to know how dosing on Morphine Sulfate ER (orally, and plugged - no IV, sorry) compares to Oxycodone IR (orally). 

General questions:
1. How much morphine sulfate ER (oral) is equal to ~15mg Oxy? 
2. What's Morphine's bioactivity for oral and plug? Does the BA change since its ER?
3. It takes 90mg of oxy for feelsgood, would it be wise to take [x amount] of morphine ER orally in order to reach feelsgood, or does the ER formula kind of obstruct this? Would crushing/parachuting the pills alter this in any means?
4.How long do these Morphine Sulfate ER effects generally last? When could I sufficiently dose [to get high] again?

Now some questions about plugging these:
1.  Can you even plug these? Does the BA change? Does plugging alter the ER at all?
2.  Can you just follow the general method for plugging, or is there a different/more effective method?

Lastly, is there anything else important that I should know about?

To call Baltimore an open air drug market is not even doing this city justice. As a college aged white guy, all I have to do is roll my driver and passenger side windows down halfway and look in the general direction of one the 10-15 dope boys that line each side of seemingly every single street in the city and listen for the symphony of brand names (different variations of references to Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown are popular currently) and encouragements to pull over. I can cop within 5 minutes off getting of the exit ramp without a phone number or a contact or getting out of my car.

I'm also staying with a friend who is prescribed 30mg oxycodones. We were unable to make it to her usual pharmacist after her doctor's appointment Friday afternoon. We have either called or visited somewhere in the neighborhood of 100+ pharmacies in the area and NONE of them have them in stock. The handful of pharmacies that DO have them in stock are not accepting new customers. A pretty decent percentage of pharmacies won't even tell you if they stock oxycodone  over the phone, preferring that you drive however far out to their store so that they can tell you in person that they have ""that particular medication on backorder"".

My personal favorite however, was the kind pharmacist who explained that he had some of the pills in stock, but not enough to fill the entire 100+ pill prescription. He said that he could do a partial script, but she would lose however many pills that were left over after he ran out. How many pills did he have in stock? 

TWENTY. 

So I just want to congratulate the DEA and the United States government on a successful and efficient handling of the War on Drugs. Its comically easy to purchase heroin off a street corner but IMPOSSIBLE to fill a legal prescription written by a doctor. This wonderful artificial shortage caused by whatever the fuck it is that they are doing has made it so that this person HAS to go buy illegal drugs to bridge her way through the weekend until Monday where she can go to her regular pharmacist and have her legal prescription filled.

It burns like hell ,then pretty much turns into a glue/gel substance and very little is absorbed. This is a totally different animal than the OP 80's or anything they have seen before. The only only way that SWIM can get it to work better than orally taking it is to cut it down to very tiny pieces, soak them in an oral syringe for about 15-20 min (should be about 90% translucent) and then plug it. Works in about 10 minutes they would say its about 5-7x stronger than orally taking it. SWIM way wondering if there is a way to break it down and to extract and Opana so it can be sniffed.

This wouldnt usually ever be a problem but I broke my rule of not trying to cop later than 5pm from anyone other than my usual trusted few spots. It was like 7:30 and starting to get darker outside. I was with my friend who was riding shotgun with the money. We get flagged down by a guy near a hospital on the block and we tell him 8 pills and he says take a left then a right into this sidestreet and make it quick because he has them on him. None of this is all that off as police pass by the hospital often and if the guy was working alone with no hitters it would be risky If a cop saw him flag me down, talk to me, then start to follow me down the alley. That's why one guy usually always takes the order and another hits you and takes the money. In larger dope shots there are one or more spotters who stand at the corners and watch for cops or knockers (narcos, undercovers)

So yeah, other then it being late and knowing that the risk of being burned is 50x higher at night, I wasn't that sketched out.

So we stop in the sidestreet and wait like 1 minute for dude to walk up. He's ~6 ft black guy in a hoodie. Dude comes up to passenger side and my friend rolls down the window and shows the money. Never ever ever hand them the money without seeing the dope or having it put in your hand for quick count. Or at the very least make the exchange at same exact time. If they burn you what are you going to do? Chase them through their territory on foot? Nah bro you're fucked. Established dope shops do not rip you off or they would not be established shops.

So dude comes up to the rolled down window and asks for the money. My boy says let me see the dope and the fucker grabs for the money! My boy won't give it up and then this fuck starts winging punches with one hand while arm wrestling for the money with the other. Well, he landed one punch. On the side of my door frame lol which couldn't have felt good. Then I ran over  his fucking foot. Looked back as i peeled out to see him limping away. It could have ended very badly if he had a knife or there were more than one of them. 

Moral of the story: be safe! Daylight is your friend. Stick to spots you trust and aren't as enclosed as an alley. This is also why I don't get out of my car and refuse to go into ""holes"" to cop. I also let my desire for dope cloud my judgement. Its like going to the grocery store hungry: you make unwise decisions.

-Use a fresh needle for every shot- the only time I don't do this is if I don't register and then I'll try again with the same needle, otherwise, I use fresh ones for every shot.
-Apply pressure to the injection site after shooting up, I usually press down on there w/a napkin for at least 30 seconds if not longer right after shooting up.
-Use Neosporin on the tracks a few times a day- it seems particularly effective using it before bed.
-Rotate injection sites as much as possible- depending on one's situation/expertise/etc this can be easier said than done. I have two veins that I hit up on a regular basis and am looking for other places to hit as well. Also trying to figure out what I'll do when it gets hot out and I can't wear long sleeves anymore.
-This last one isn't a direct way to minimize tracks but I feel it helps, getting a vein to pop up for a nice, smooth and easy shot helps cut down on noticable tracks and bruising. This includes but is not limited to staying hydrated, properly using a torniquet and sometimes gently palpating the vein if you're having issues w/it coming up.

The following is the Statewide summary of opiates. As I've said many times, the opiates are the epidemic of the 10's if you are concerned with your use, or the use of a friend or loved one, please contact me. 

**Heroin**

Heroin is highly available in all regions, and it is the most
available street drug in the Youngstown region. Brown
powdered is the most available type of heroin in Akron-
Canton, Cleveland and Youngstown; white powdered heroin
is most available in Dayton and Toledo; brown and white
powdered heroin are most available in Cincinnati; and
black tar heroin is most available in Columbus and Athens.
During the last six months, availability has increased in
every region. Many who became addicted to prescription
opioids have progressed to heroin, citing pain doctors as
bridges to heroin. Law enforcement cite increased heroin
trafficking by Mexican drug cartels, many positing that
heroin is an easy substitute for prescription opioids as reason
for increased availability. Many dealers throughout the state
have switched from selling crack cocaine to heroin because
of increased demand for heroin. Many users attribute their
switch from prescription opioids to heroin to the ease
and affordability of obtaining heroin over prescription
opioids. Users and professionals named the reformulation
of OxyContin® OC into OxyContin® OP as a reason for the
spike in heroin use statewide. Crime labs across regions
report that current processed heroin is “very pure.” Current
street jargon includes many names for heroin, with the most
common names being “boy” and “dog food.” In every region
heroin can be purchased for as little as $10. There is a rapid
progression from first heroin use to regular intravenous
use of heroin, the most common mode of administration
of heroin. Treatment providers report that young (teens
through early 20’s), suburban, White males with an opioid
abuse history are those most often presenting for treatment
for heroin abuse/dependence, with increases in admissions
of females also noted. Overdose with heroin, particularly
heroin with benzodiazepines, is reportedly very common.
Other substances used in combination with heroin include
alcohol, cocaine, marijuana and prescription opioids.


**Prescription Opioids**

Prescription opioids are highly available in all regions.
During the last six months, availability has remained high
in Athens, Cincinnati and Toledo, while increasing in Akron-
Canton, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Youngstown.
Increased availability is attributed to increased prescribing in
hospitals, private physicians’ offices and pain clinics. Opioids
are most often obtained through prescription, with users
reporting ease in feigning pain and knowing of physicians
who write prescriptions for payment. Prescription opioids
are also commonly obtained from street-level drug dealers,
friends, family members, and others with prescriptions who
either sell or trade opioids for other drugs. Across regions,
participants report drug dealers sending people to Florida to
obtain prescriptions for opioids to sell in Ohio. OxyContin®,
Percocet® and Vicodin® are the most available for street
purchase. Generally, prescription opioids sell for $.50 - $1.25
per milligram across regions. Reformulation of OxyContin®
OC into OxyContin® OP has decreased the availability of
OxyContin® OC while increasing its street value ($1 - $2 per
milligram). OxyContin® OP, designed to have greater tamperresistant
factors, replaced OxyContin® OC in pharmacies.
When users attempt to crush and dissolve OxyContin®
OP, the pill breaks down into a gel instead of a powder,
making intranasal inhalation (i.e., snorting) or intravenous
injection extremely difficult. Although users report ways of
manipulating the less desirable OxyContin® OP for snorting/
injecting, OxyContin® OC remains the most desirable
prescription opioid. Many in law enforcement are concerned
that as OxyContin® OC becomes scarcer and more expensive,
and users determine OxyContin® OP too difficult to abuse,
more users will switch to heroin. Treatment providers refer
to prescription opioids as, “the gateway drug to heroin.”
Users and professionals note an alarming increase in use
among young people (teens through early 20’s). The most
common routes of administration are oral consumption and
intranasal inhalation, with notable increases in intravenous
injection recorded. Prescription opioids are commonly used
in combination with alcohol, benzodiazepines (i.e., Xanax®)
and marijuana.

**Suboxone®**

Street availability of Suboxone® is high in all regions,
with the exception of Akron-Canton and Toledo where
it is moderately available. Street availability is generally
perceived as increasing across regions. Those most currently
using Suboxone® are prescribed it while in an alcohol and
other drug rehabilitation facility or in conjunction with an
outpatient treatment program. Those obtaining Suboxone®
on the street are primarily prescription opioid/heroin
addicted who use the drug to fight withdrawal symptons
between highs. In terms of diversion, Suboxone® is often
traded for another prescription opioid or heroin. Self-pay for
prescribed Suboxone® is reportedly more costly than street
purchase. A Suboxone® 8 mg dose most frequently sells for
$10 – $20; users report paying more if they are “dope sick.”
Although not common, there are widespread reports of users
abusing Suboxone® as a means of getting high. Those who
abuse are thought not to have an opioid abuse history. It is
becoming common knowledge that standard drug screens
do not screen for the presence of Suboxone®. Modes of abuse
are swallowing as prescribed, crushing and then snorting/
injecting (injection is rare but reportedly increasing).
Suboxone® is not likely to be combined with other drug use,
but when combined, it is used in conjunction with alcohol,
benzodiazepines (i.e., Xanax®) and marijuana.",1332871750.0

I'm finally starting to feel normal and be able to sleep even if it isn't perfect sleep.  But god I want to get high.  But I can't, well, I shouldn't really, I mean I could but it'd be inadvisable.  

A little background, I'm seventeen and first tried opiates about 3 - 3 and a half years ago and for a while they were hard to find.  Besides I was mainly interested in acid and shrooms and pot and E.  Slowly that changed.  I realized I didn't like pot, shrooms made me feel sick, E has the potential to be pretty neurotoxic and acid just wasn't easy to find.  Then I managed to find opiates a little more easily and meth too.  So for the last 2 years or so there's been a lot of meth (pretty much just given to me) and more and more opiates as they became easier to find.  Then about a year ago almost exactly I finally managed to find a heroin connect something I'd been looking for since seventh/eighth grade (fucked up priorities) I chipped for a while then relented to being strung out (already had a friend who was strung out at that point and had been for a while) kicked in October but that was just to get my tolerance down and to do it.  I was clean for two weeks, did it with a friend, as soon as those two weeks were up jumped right back into it.  Two weeks ago almost to the minute my parents found out.  I'd nodded off and left my kit in my backpack (rigs, tourniquet, spoon, cottons, bags, etc.) thankfully I managed to stash some sub and do a quick taper.  So anyway I'm in drug counseling now, 2 times a week, random drug testing.  My parents are scared and angry and betrayed and I feel terrible.  I never meant for them to find out because I never wanted to hurt them and this puts a terrible stress on them.  So anyway, I want to get high.  I miss the needle and the ritual and the high.  Though I'm glad to have made it through WDs I was gonna kick anyways (why I had the sub, I'd already used all the H.  If they'd waited two days they would have found nothing but oh well.) but I planned on chipping, or attempting to chip (as we all know how that goes a lot of the time) not getting 100% clean.  I keep planning and scheming how to get my hands on some and using once a week in between counseling so I could pass drug tests but I know that if they found out it would be terribly hard on them and I'd probably get kicked out.  So anyways sorry to rant to you but I needed someplace to let it all out.  There are very few people I can talk to about this and for the most part they're cut off from contact with me at the moment.  If anyone has any advice or wants to share stories feel free.

I got my first connects from a girl I met on facebook. Through her, I would pick up from the mexicans and most of the time have to buy her a b (ugh). 

I also got a connect from her friend, but he was always horribly late, shorted me often, and definitely was just cutting the shit he got from mexicans.
Right now, I have no connects that are reliable and havent for nearly a week and a half. It really sucks a lot, because I'm on break from class and I have nothing to celebrate with - and am also WD'ing. It's no fun.

So, quick background:  I haven't used anything but subs(barring one swallow of codeine cough syrup for a sore throat) since Mid-February. Not counting clean days or anything, just trying to resist copping. I buy them from a friend.  I have about 11 8mg pills left.  On a normal day, I take .5mg in the AM and .5mg at bed time.

Lately, I have been in a funk.  It's not a withdrawal thing;  it's directly related to a stressor in my life.  You could call it ""situational depression.""
I've been using closer to 1.5mg twice a day.  It definitely calms me down a bit more and lifts me out of my funk. 

2 questions:  

1) Am I going to build a tolerance to this level quickly, like I would with full agonist opiates?  If I continue on this path, will I need 3mg a day to feel like I did on 1mg a day?  If the answer is YES, about how long will it take before I hit that wall?

2) When I need an extra ""pick me up,"" I've been crushing and tooting the pill. I find it kicks in a little faster, kind of like putting a benzo under your tongue as opposed to swallowing.  Am I wasting sub? Is this purely a placebo effect telling me I am getting more from it this way?

Today I took 2 x 2mg pills of normal over the counter Imodium and I am noticing that I feel kind of high. This is the first time I've taken them (and did so on doctor's orders to help with diarrhea). I have never done opiates recreationally, though I have had codeine in the form of cough syrup or T3's and definitely also felt high on those occasions.

Anyone have any idea what could be going on? I am currently experiencing mildly increased sensation, very slight euphoric ""waves"". It reminds me of what it feels like when ecstasy is about to kick in.

I should add that in the past I have done other types of drugs recreationally and have noticed that I am more sensitive than others at being able to detect when it's ""kicked in"". However, I haven't done anything other than alcohol, marijuana and mushrooms recreationally in 6 to 8 years. I am not on any other medications.

I was in a really bad car reck last year which left me with one ruptured disc and 2 herniated disc. I just had my 3rd major back surgery in a 5 month period. Each time I left the hospital after my surgeries the strongest pain medication my doctor would give me is hydrocodene 10mg 325mg which I was prescribed to take one every 4 hours. I have been on these for at least a year now and have built up a huge tolerance to them. It usually take 7 minimum to even get a decent amount of relief. In-between my 2nd and third surgery I was in a lot of pain and asked if I could be put on anything stronger and all I was prescribed was ultracet and phenergan which did shit besides make me sleepy as hell. Finally I asked him to give me something stronger for when I went home from the hospital after the last surgery. He prescribed me oxycodone (percocet) 10mg 325mg to take once every 6 hours. I feel like even with this I'm still getting screwed because they are a little stronger but with the less frequent dosage
And small amount he prescribed (40) that I might as well just stick to high dosages of hydrocodone. I see people here that get prescribed way stronger pain meeds than what I have right now and I could almost guaranty my pain is at the very least equal to theirs. What's going on here? Am I doing or saying something wrong? Is this normal for doctors to do? I feel like I'm being strung a long here, like they have the ability to make
The pain go away but wont do it.  However, when it comes to recommending surgery they are so eager to convince me to have it, saying that this will be the last surgery and it will be the magic bullet to fix all my back problema.

I in no way forced this on him. My friend was using OCs long before I even got into them. Later on, when I started, I used to pick up OCs for him, and vice versa. Once I made the turn to diesel, however, I guess I made the mistake of letting him try it.

I dropped off a few bags to my friend tonight at another friends house, and this close friend to my friend was there. I don't believe my friend told the kid I provided them, but I believe he put two and two together when my friend offered to him some, and this occurred after I showed up. It seemed like the kid respectfully denied. However, I got a different side as I left the house.

He followed me out of the house, what seemed like he was getting something out of his car. He told me to hold up, I turned, and he proceeded to inform me: ""If you ever provide dope to <friend's name> again, I'll knock your fucking teeth out. You don't know who I am, or who I know, but I'll ruin your life. Go ahead, rat me out to <friend's name>, do what you got to do..."", and the rest is forgotten. I had no idea what to say. I was definitely shocked. I was not expecting this at all. I had just met this kid, but apparently he must be close to our mutual friend. Only thing I said was, ""I'm sorry."" I'm certainly not sorry to that kid. I do feel sorry to our friend though, who certainly doesn't have a problem as far as I can see, but this mutual friend does not approve of dope. Cocaine isn't a problem, of course. 

So, yeah, I wanted to get that off my chest. I know this is a fucked up game just with the people within it, but I never expected to receive a threat like this -- from someone who doesn't even know me. I am pretty far from a confrontational person, and he's right -- I do not know who this kid is. I'm pretty sure I can tell he is of Italian origin, and I hate to label people, and make stereotypes, but they just have a history of making threats, having connections, etc.

I don't want to say anything to my friend, but with this post, I'm sure he'll find out..

I noticed how most of you got started with some form of prescription, before eventually moving on with the harder stuff (or not). would you say that opiate addiction is direct result of doctors prescribing opiates too easily, or ultimately the pharma industry ever trying to increase their profits? I'm assuming a good amount of people wind up in addiction after getting opiates for a legitimate reason like an injury, and not trying them out for fun to see what they're like. Out of naivety, maybe, I always had the impression that heroin was the way into an opiate addiction, and meds only a substitute.

How likely is it, in your opinion, that someone like me, who has no real connections, knows no doctors, or even people loosely related to opiates, when trying to see what all the fuss is about, ends up with a huge problem? I've never had real problems with addiction besides a heavy nicotine habit, but then i have no experience with these substances. I'm merely interested in having a better understanding.

Thank you for your time!

Usually in order to detect the other semi synthetics such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, an extended opiate panel is needed which usually is found under OXY or OPI-300/100 on extended panel drug test. This OXY panel is basically just a super sensitive version of the OPI panael, or at least it was at the testing center I worked out.  

Hear is the following cut off levels for your standard 5 panel OPI test



OPIATE 2,000 (OPI)

Morphine	 2000 ng/mL

Codeine	 2000 ng/mL

Ethylmorphine	5000 ng/mL

Hydrocodone	 125000 ng/mL

Hydromorphone	 5000 ng/mL

Levorphanol	75000 ng/mL

6-Monoacetylmorphine ( 6-MAM)	5000 ng/mL

Morphine 3-beta-D-glucuronide	2000 ng/mL

Norcodeine	12500 ng/mL

Normorphine	50000 ng/mL

Oxycodone	25000 ng/mL

Oxymorphone	25000 ng/mL

Procaine	150000 ng/mL

Thebaine	100000 ng/mL




As you can see the cutoff levels for the semi synthetics are quite high and would probably require you to be a extreme level addict, but still allow for you to fail if you have enough in your system.  ",1333250027.0

I was twenty at the time, in my second year of studies at The University of Florida.  Despite my insatiable desire for parties (whatever shape or form they took on), I was doing pretty well academically.  Every semester I would get a huge check from my Prepaid college plan, only half of which went to tuition thanks to an additional state run scholarship program.  Needless to say, those checks mostly went to oxy, heroin, and cocaine.

At the beginning of Spring 2007 semester, I was well into a 5 gram bag of powder heroin I acquired from a sketchy 50 year old Puerto Rican guy—a friend of a friend of a friend.  The dope was quite good, and as a result, I was floating around campus all week with the trademark “ice cream grin” we’re all so fond of.  On the final day of “add/drop” period (the second week of classes), I went into my American Lit 3000 course, sat down, surveyed the room, and began to unpack my stuff.  The kid in front of me looked back, did a double take, and sort of winced at me a bit.  I got a similar look from a girl a few seats down.  Finally, after a few more puzzled glances from the strangers in that class, I ran to the bathroom.  

When I got there, I was shocked by what I saw in the mirror.  Having fixed up in my friends car just before class, I completely rushed the process.  Apparently as I wiped my arm off and packed up all my gear, I had tucked the rig above my ear like a pen.  I completely forgot,  and as a result, that neon orange cap shone like a beacon of my self-destruction for the whole world to see.  It was so humiliating; I didn’t even go back to the class.  I went home, dropped the course, and enrolled the following semester.

So, b/r/opiates, share some humorous drug stories with me.

Also I heard you can smoke it on foil and let it run down. My question is how much should I try? ( I know the golden rule you can always have more but you can't take away)


Another question is I am mailing the rest to a bro who is gonna trade it to me for 20 10/325 percs.  Any advice on mailing as this is very smelly? I only have experiance shipping/receiving pills cause dogs can smell em.

Okay so I have been addicted to oxy, and heroin for one and a half years. Today I am on day 5 of being heroin free. I used about 50 mg of methadone the first and second day, third day was still feeling okay until night when I took half a sub, and ate about 3 canna-brownies. Woke up this morning at 7 feeling not so great. Went to the methadone/sub clinic for intake. (I saw a counselor on Monday about getting clean cause I am very serious about it this time and really really want to quit!) I messed around with pharms and whatnot before I broke my knee-cap about 2 years ago, but nothing major, def no dope though. After I hurt my knee, I got dependent on the oxy because I had a high dose for several months, and the I told the doctor I was getting physically dependent on them and he cut me off completely, immediately (Probably because I'm only 21). So I started getting them from other sources, but after a doctor that was writing A BUNCH of scripts in town 'retired' price skyrocketed and I could only afford dope, which one of my old friends had started selling.
So I am off H for 5 days, and still really motivated to stay off, although this morning was the worst off all! Especially during intake (and the doc wasn't there so I need to go back Monday morning). My problem is that I am having knee surgery in mid may, and want to be in a stable place with either methadone or subs for the surgery, (and yes, I will tell my surgeon, or have my clinic doctor talk to him also). I have heard that methadone is much harder getting off than subs, and for some even harder than H. My concern is that I still have chronic knee pain, and I'm worried that before my surgery and right after, if I'm only on subs, that it is not going to be enough, and I will start using again. So I was thinking about getting on methadone until I have surgery, have the surgery and taper down the methadone while on other pain meds after surgery, and then switch over to subs and stop the pain pills at the best time recommended, when I don't actually need them for severe pain.
Any advice greatly appreciated.",1333750614.0

I started out with your standard 5/500 vicodin, I can still remember getting high off literally half a 5, and then slowly building up tolerance. Now I'm at the point where it takes nearly 80mg of hydro to get me going. 

I have always had access to a constant supply of anything really. I make a lot of money with my online business ($100's daily, sometimes thousand or so in a deal I make), I really don't know how I somehow managed to function everyday, but now its just getting to the point where I don't want to do anything. My tolerance has really sky rocketed because I started taking opiates from the minute I woke up until the minute I go to sleep. Its gotten to the point where I can't even get up and take a shower because it hurt so much. I guess it really started going downhill when I recently found Opana ER. Fuck you opana you're so amazing. Snorting all that shit, even after I read how bad the silica is for your lungs. It truly is some amazing stuff, I'm glad I tried it before the reformulation. 

I tapered myself off Opana with Hydro/Oxy and luckily suffered no ill effects. I went from Opana 40 a day to an Opana 20 a day. I was able to keep it under control by snorting small lines periodically rather than doing a 20 all at once or something, granted it really ruined the amazing high I could of gotten, I'd like to think I've always been smart with my drug use.. aside from all the fucking apap I've killed my liver with. 

Anyhow, I'm on day 2 of getting clean and this isn't so bad. I tapered off Hydro use from 8 (10mg) a day, 6 a day, 4 a day, 2 a day, 1, and now I'm good. I like listening to music again, I don't mind working, I actually like my family, I feel love for my girlfriend, and I started working out again. Before I fell deep into opiates, I used to go to the gym 5 times a week, have a crazy strict diet, now I'm skinny as fuck again. I really think I prefer being clean.. for now. Thank god for Loperamide btw, chugging that shit like crazy. 

I think I'm going to join a narcotics anonymous group, get a new phone number, delete my dealers', and really stay clean for good now. I don't think I can even go back to it one time, because I make enough money to just blow $500+ on a bag of pills and not give a shit. Thats really my problem. Seriously once you have a steady supply, you're fucked. 

Any other clean advice from anyone? Anything else I should try to do to stay clean, I really want to go back to enjoying life without opiates. I've done this before, it just seems like the first few days are okay, but then a week sets in and the depression comes, then I score some more and its like the best high ever, but it never lasts :(

Been doing Bupe every day for quite a few years now, with a few short episodes of being clean.

I know most of you see no point in Bupe for recreational/self-medication purposes, but it has kept me quite balanced and leveled. Kind of like maintenance I suppose, been keeping it at a specific dose pretty much. Not looking to IV, nod out everytime etc, just a comfortable.. baseline.

Done quite a bunch of other stuff occasionally, like a few other opioids, various stimulants, cannabis, hallucinogens but mostly many kinds of benzo which I'm relatively fond of.

But I have also become quite depressed and due this being unemployed and pretty much staying at home 24/7, living on welfare like a bum, which feels awful. Hate being a leecher with no purpose in life.

To get some kind of diagnosis or help I must get clean for a certain amount of time before the docs will accept me in and get some SSRI or whatever treatment. So I'll either discover if it's the Bupe, the rest of the drugs or just.. me, that's making me depressed. 

I'm kind of hoping it is me, since I have a hard time seeing myself never doing opioids/benzo ever again. It would be preferable to get some other treatment. I think it has become a bad cycle, repeating itself. I stay inside, becoming more and more depressed and introvert.

Will probably ask for cold turkey and be in there for 2-3 weeks, should cover the immediate withdrawal at least.

I am very tired of living like this, the problem is not truly being able to envision anything else being worthwile, or noticeably better. I've never liked to hang out with people, talk with them or their boring Average Joe life. Can't seem to find my place in life. 

I dunno, I just hope this time it will be different. Just feels like I'm floating through life with no purpose, and too many years have gone by. I'm a disappointment to my family who always have to jump in and help me. I have a heard time telling what day, month or even year it is sometimes, due to every day being pretty much the same. It wears me down, especially not knowing how much can be attributed to the drug, and myself, having mental health problems in the family.

I just can't find the motivation or energy to setup a goal that I can believe in and I'm terrified it will be the same even when I'm clean. Wish me luck I guess

Long time lurker, first time poster etc.

A bunch of years ago I was a pretty nasty car accident and had to have some major hardware installed to help my bones heal.  I was given a prescription for a bunch of IR 30mg oxycodone pills every two weeks.  Wash, rinse, repeat for about 2 years.  The oxy's were great for my pain and mood, but after losing a bottle and going through w/d's I realized this sort of life wasn't sustainable.

I decided to clean myself up a bit, and my doctor suggested a lighter opiate for the sometimes severe pain I still get.  He gave me hydrocodon-acetaminophen 5-325's.  

I do CWE to cut down on the liver damage and amp up my dose as needed, but I notice different effects overall from these pills as compared to my IR oxys.  I don't get any euphoria, and where I used to be energized I am now tired after dosing.

TL;DR: Are hydrocodone and oxycodone really different in effect, or is this just in my head?

I could have waited until I got home, and done it in the bathroom, been clean about it, etc. But instead, I did it down the street, in my car, virtually in the dark, and missed, and now have half a golf ball on the crook of my arm, and missed my only bag I had -- on top of being on subs today, so it was worthless but I felt like complete shit and was jonesin' to boot up. 

So, hopefully tomorrow is a better day, and hopefully this doesn't turn into a basketball overnight. That was my only good arm/area, too.

Just been a terrible, terrible day. Been sick, resort to subs, but they still make me feel like shit/depressed. Sold some equipment to a place that always gives cash, but they apparently had none so I had to get a check -- after banks are closed. So I got fucked and had a friend spot me a bag, and I missed, and now I'm pissed and in pain all over again.

I got through with 60mg within two hours then get another 30mg before going to read and go to class. My first class got out 10 minutes early so I had a thirty minute break to go grab a 20mg line before my second class. After that class I go get 4 blues and end up doing 2.5 of them and giving away the rest to friends because I was that high. Ended the night by grabbing a couple beers and playing a few games of pool, followed by a blunt and movie session. It has been a great day.

Can you smoke percocets after you've removed the acetaminophen? 2. What is parachuting and is there an advantage to it? 3. Is plugging a real thing and (how) would you do it with 10/325's?

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Just a little background, you can skip if you like. I stick to pills. I've been nursing a chip for several years now. I try to pace myself, I'll go weeks or months without, and I stay away from the lifestyle and don't have any real friends who use. Because of this, my knowledge is spotty in places. Also, my terminology and understanding of the vernacular may not be that great. *Sorry in advance that it takes me forever to say anything and  I really do appreciate any help you guys can give me.*

My preferred method is smoking. It feels like chasing the dragon to me. My favorite was the 80 mg oxycontins when they were still available to me. They were smooth and tasted good and burned just right. Watching the lines bubble up and go black was...romantic.

 I recently picked up some little green 15 mg pills (oxycodone hydrochloride). I smoked a couple of them and think they're what caused my lungs to bleed the other night(they smoked harsh and later on I woke up nauseous and was spitting up mouthfuls of clear saliva with strings of bright blood in it. I've decided I'll snort the remaining pills.

**Question 1:** I have some percocet 10/325's. My preferred method for ingesting is smoking. I crushed 4 of them, stirred thoroughly in a small amount of warm water, added 2 or 3 ounces of ice-cold water, let settle in the freezer for 10 minutes, then strained through a french press to remove the acetaminophen.

I poured the liquid into the largest pyrex pan I had and planned to let the water evaporate over the course of a few days, but after 16 hours decided to just drink it. 

However, there was time for a little evaporation and some residue white powder had dried in the pan. I scraped it all into a decent sized little pile and now I'm wondering--is it worth trying to smoke it? Would it be dangerous if there was some acetaminophen that hadn't filtered out? Or is it possible that it's just straight acetaminophen? **Is there a better method of trying to extract the hydrocodone in powder form?**

That last bit is the heart of the question, really.

Questions 2-9: I've heard people here talk about parachuting. I just read on urbandictionary that it means eating powder wrapped in toilet paper. Is that true? Is there a reason or benefit to doing that as opposed to just using a pill crusher or chewing them up in your mouth? What's the deal with plugging(something else I only heard of through this subreddit)? Is it better than snorting or smoking? How would one try it with either of the 2 types of pills I have, or is that not a good idea? Also, what are benzos? What are the names of the best ones? What are fair prices and what's the best ratio or method of mixing with them?

Thanks for putting up with my questions. I've been enjoying my brief time lurking in this community.",1334227586.0

Nothing impressive, but rare for me to see these days.
I pay WAY to much, for everything.

Here's a list (nothing is usually available at the same time, other than roxys, list is what I've seen and the prices)

Roxy 30mg Vs/mBox/a215/K9s/54199s---$40ea...$35ea on occasion for 3+, $35ea for 10+
^available daily, excluding some days rarely


Opana 10mg---$20


Opana 20mg---$40, rarely $35


Opana 30mg---$55


Opana 40mg---$80, rarely $70-$75, as high as $90-$120


Oxy OP 40mg---$40, rarely $35


Oxy OP 80mg---$75, rarely $65-$70


OG Oxy OC 40mg---$50
^suuuper rare

OG Oxy OC 80mg---$100, as high as $120
^pretty sure the stockpile is gone, wouldn't know, never could swallow paying that *lolz*

Norco Hydros 10/325---$8, sometimes $5



*Everything is insuffulated, hydro is cwe'ed*

*nothing available simultaneously, very rare to find anything other than roxys*

***just typing these numbers makes me sick, ughh



Made a new *friend* today with Roxy30mg's for $28, so that's great news (that might sign crazy, I know)

I asked could i just lower the apap and go 4x a day? And then i think the opiate god whispered into his ear because he said these magical words


"" you worried about the apap? have you tried oxycodone? its the same but no apap."" i will give you 75 30mg roxicodone, so you dont have to worry.

Compare this to oxycodone, which comes both mixed with APAP (Percocet) and without it (blues, OC40/60/80, etc). So my question is, why don't any pharmaceutical companies make, for instance, a 30 mg hydrocodone pill with no APAP? 

I always liked the feeling of hydrocodone, but with my tolerance I find it much more convenient to use blues and/or opana. If only higher doses of hydrocodone existed in pill form (i.e. w/o having to perform a CWE) without the tylenol...

will kill a user with no tolerance? (calculations 
inside)[Also TL;DR]","I've checked the sidebar before posting, just to make sure.
I did the conversion of Diamorphine to morphine; seeing as the minimum lethal dose of morphine is 200mg and 2.3–5.2 mg Diamorphine is equivilant to 10mg morphine. By this calculation (Using 3.5 because the Diamorphine isnt completely pure[using 20 because 20x10mg=200mg lethal dose morphine]) 3.5x20=70. So assumedly, 70mg IV'd would kill me. But insufflation is only around 80% absorbtion right?

So then i would multiply 80% by 70 which leaves me at 56. So 70-56 is 14. I would need to add another 14mg putting me at 84mg for lethal dosage. These figures are all relatively ballparked. Am i anywhere near correct?

Did i leave something out- my measurements- 150lbs, 5'8, around 12% bf, little to no tolerance to opiates. ( Used under 5 times; oxycodone, codiene, hydrocodone)

On a side note:
Not to say i want to kill myself, or anyone else for that matter. I did a line of 30 mg last night and it put me to sleep quite promptly. I'm pushing the limits and well aware of the consequences.


**TL;DR From my psuedo-calculations, I have come up with a number for the lethal amount insufflated;84mgs ( of my current supply of heroin). Am i anywhere near correct? What did i leave out?**

Would you trade your 2 week script of 45 8mg Subutex for 25 bags, all or nothing?","You'll probably do too much dope and be sick and the end of the 2 weeks, but this question is killing me. It's all or nothing too, no trading half the script for anything.


**Edit: Here's something to make your brains crank harder.**

Let's remove the requirement of selling all the subs.

Final cost of 45 8mg subs (doctor+Script) = $339,

They can be sold from $12-14 fairly easy. $14 is harder to get and requires someone to be in need, but 12 is easy to get.

The dope man will only pay 12. I can trade him 2 subs and a dollar for a bag, if I don't take the better deal on doing them all at once.

*Here's some misc info I posted in a reply below:*

""Quality of the dope: about .15 will have me good good, .2 will prob induce a nod even with a big tolerance like mine. This area actually gets pretty good dope, but it's expensive, 25 a bag (Sounds crazy, but Roxi 30s are also 25 here and a bag will do much more, so they sell anyway, despite the price.)

Willpower: lol.

Financial Situation: About $100 bucks for smokes/drugs/fun over 2 weeks. That's 4 bags if I blew it all on dope. There is NO ONE else I know of in the area prescribed subs besides me. They're actually very in demand (among a few people) and I can usually sell them for 14 if I give it time. The dope man will only pay the equivalent to 12 a pill however, and will only accept trades, does not pay cash.""

Ive been getting 3 of them for 100 and it usually ends up being .6-.7grams. The last stuff was some fire greyish stuff, this stuff is kinda bone white. Is this a good price for good qaulity dope ?

Sorry for the crappy pic http://i.imgur.com/sNi0C.jpg

As you can see i put 2 little chunks on a piece of foil and took 1 hit off it. It slides across the foil really nice and doesn't leave much residue till the last hit, and the leftover cut doesn't seem like much compared to the amount of dope smoked, and it turns a very nice crimson red color. The taste is very very strong. 2 hits of this dope made my buddy with no tolerance puke. So it's must be pretty good qaulity right ? 

I just notice it burns up kinda fast, and off like a few nice little chunks I only get 1-3 hits. Now if I put a boulder on there, it will run back and forth across the foil a few times and give 6-7 hits.. but im talking like .1 chunk. Am I wasting this shit cuz its not the right kind to smoke ?? I don't really like snorting and I kinda have some sinus problems from previous heavy drug use in my early 20's, and I really dont wanna go down the IV road. It's been really tempting lately too cuz my tolerance is so high I can barely get high by smoking it anymore, and this is supposed to be A grade shit. 

edit: I took a tiny little chunk and tossed it in a spoon with some water and it dissolved with a little stirring, no heat. So im pretty sure its #4, and thats not as great to smoke I'm reading. Is there anyway to make it more smokeable and last longer ? Can you add caffeine to it to make it more like #3 ?

I took the shot and sat back in the tent waiting. Oh and by the way, about 5 mins before I took the shot I ate 5-6 hits of acid. Then, cut to 5-10 mins later and I'm barfing and sweating and my mouth tastes like nag champa. I black out after that and came to is the medical center they had there. While I was laying there with an IV in my arm and my beard filled with barf I started to trip my asshole inside out. The nurse holds up the bag of my ""tar"" and says ""is this what you used?"" and I nodded and she told me it was just incense. The nurse wanted me to go to a hospital but the main dr. guy said I would be ok but to come back if I started feeling bad again. They also gave me naloxone because my gf that gave them the bag of my ""tar"" said it was heroin. So I ended up going into terrible WDs because of the 160mgs of OC I did earlier...while tripping. So since I was feeling like shit I decided to head back to camp and try to relax but on my way back a cop decided to pick me out and fuck with me, probably because I looked like a zombie on account of the vomit now caked into my beard and pupils the size of half dollars. I knew he was going to search me so I quickly ate the remaining 4 hits of acid I had in my pocket so I wouldn't get popped. The cop searched me (I was in a cartoon at this point) and found my dugout with fresh herb in it, I forgot about having the dugout on me but hey, at least it wasn't acid. He wrote some stuff down on a ticket thing and gave it to me. I threw it away and it never came up again, don't even have any warrants. I finally made it back to camp and crawled in my tent and listened to Weird Al and Tom Waits tapes until I felt good enough to pass out. 

**TL;DR** - I injected that Indian poop stick incense thinking it was tar while I was on acid and OC and then got shoved dick first into WDs when a nurse gave me naloxone when someone said I was on heroin and then got searched by a cop while tripping and going through WDs which went better than expected. Also, beard vomit cake.

Currently, I am being drug tested once a week. My court date is in a week. After that, I will be getting drug tested twice a week.

Well, last Monday, April 9th, I went in for my drug test, pissed clean, and right after I left I met up with an old dealer. He is really far from where I live so I never meet him otherwise (we both don't have cars). I bought 6 (.1 g) bags of pretty decent heroin. I shot 2 1/2 immediately after buying it, then did the rest later that night. 

I know, I know, relapse lectures yaddayaddayadda. I'm not proud of me either, but as a friend told me ""Don't tell me you're sorry you did it, because you are not sorry!"" My defense is that I knew it would be the last time I could use for a year and I wanted it to be good. So I did it, it's done, and I can safely and honestly say I will not be doing/taking any drugs at all for the next year because I am NOT going to fail and end up in jail. HELL NO. 

Now, I am also on Suboxone, but I take it very irregularly (trying to keep myself from acquiring a dependence) and will only take 2mg a day, if any. I also take an Ambien here or there when I can't get to sleep. I work as a server 3-4 days out of the week, ride my bike regularly and only drink water. 

My next drug test is tomorrow. It will have been exactly 7 days since IV-ing the heroin. 
Now, after researching a bit, most websites say you'll be good after 3-4 days. I'm just a bit skeptical, because I don't know what the heroin was cut with, and if that would make any difference. Does anyone else have any insight on how long it may be in my system, or any last minute tips on flushing it out- besides ton's of water?

Here. This is for the ones that gel. I believe they are the ER however. If you must, google ""injecting 'type of pill you have'"" and you should probly get something from bluelight or opiophile.
Here it is anyway though, I found it:

"" Not exactly sure what you have but I used to shoot the ones that gel up like this (and this probably isn't safe...duh):

 1.Have a wet cotton and a rig to suck it up READY.

2.Get the coating off the pill and crush it up in a page from a magazine. Have it ready to pour and put it aside for a second.

3.Put a full rig of water in a spoon with a pinch of salt in there and mix it up (helps it keep from gelling up, I used table salt but there are better kinds)

4.Get the water to a boil.

5.QUICKLY pour the powdered pill into one side of the water.

6.QUICKLY put the cotton a little to the side of where you put the pill powder.

7.Suck it up.

It's the best way I've found to do the ones that gel up, but if you can feel it orally, do that. I wouldn't think they'd work well intra-nasaly, but don't take my word for it.
EDIT: I'm not sure why, but the formatting is forcing my 6 and 7 to be a 1 and a 2. Go figure. ""

Got into a fight April 6th, resulting in several broken bones in hand.

-*Prescribed 4/8:* **Hydrocodone/APAP 7.5/500mg Lortab x30**
   Took 1 Lortab in morning, 2 lortab in evening until 4/16

-*Prescribed 4/12:* **APAP/Codeine 300/30mg x30 (weak as shit)
**   Took 3-5 of those per day until 4/16, often taken with Lortab 

*Until Monday 16th the effects were as follows:*

-Lortab-1 worked decent the first day and a half, then I began taking them by the 2's. parachuting 2 would have me strongly medicated, nodding out lightly-not too overwhelming-just fantastic. 

-Codeine-Not as effective as the Lortab. Ate them like candy because i was worried about running out of Lortab. Saving these, would be useful for less severe pain in the future.

**-Effectiveness**
-2 lortab always made me enter a blissful, pain-free state until 2 days ago. 

*4/15-current*
Lortabs don't last 2 hours, maybe? Codeine being taken in between Lortabs effective timespan. Pain starting up again. also noticing lower pack pains now once Lortab's wear off in evening before nighttime dose.

*4/16*

-Parachute 2 Lortab @ 10am
-2 more Lortab @ 1:30pm (also took 2 codeine)
-Parachute 2 Lortab @  8pm
-.5gram hashish smoked @ 8:30pm
-90mg codeine parachuted @10pm
Effects: Lortab dose #1 was very weak, almost forgot I took em. #2 relaxing, but combined with copious amts of hash, #3 effects diminished
Couldn't fall asleep until 2am


today-prescibed Norco 10/325mg x30. Lortab is next to useless now.
noticing insane increase in tolerance. hard to fall asleep night of 4/16, even after 15mg hydrocodone, 90mg codeine, and .25mg Xanax.


Conclusion:
Lortabs worked great, for the first 3days, fourth day was less effective (4/12), then started supplementing Lortabs with codeine to try and get back where I was a few days ago.
I got switched from 7.5/500's to 10/325's because the lortabs kinda scare me. My number one concern is:
All this APAP/tylenol in these pills. 
What can I ask my Dr. about alternate pain meds when I see him tomorrow?
I need a painkiller that has none or much less APAP. What medications would fit these specs?
All this APAP worries me and my liver.

Today's (4/17) regimen was:
-Vyvanse 90mg taken from 7am-12:30pm

-10pm: 1 Norco split into halves
-10:30pm: 2 Lortab parachuted
-11pm: 1 norco parachuted
-11:15pm .25mg xanax

It's now 1:57am on 4/18, not feeling how I should be feeling considering a week ago these dosages would of been unthinkable. 

But 35mg hydrocodone, .25mg xanax....not effective because of the Vyvanse (like adderall aka amphetamine) I took earlier in the day?",1334739988.0

You can walk into the clinics and they give out packs which contain: any gauge needle you need, any size syringe, filters, alcowipes and a sharps bin. There's enough for 5 rigs in each pack. All free and as many packs as you can carry. 

They ask your age, post code, and DOC for statistics but no identifying info. If the clinics are closed for the day or on a weekend, we have vending machines which sell the same kit for $2.00. They do charge for wheel filters, only cost price though as they aren't funded by the government. 

We can also walk into a chemist and buy a sharps kit, they price gouge, use very shitty syringes and have large bore needle tips, but you do get a horribly judgmental look thrown in for free. I like to avoid the chemist kits. 

In some areas of the country that have a high population of drug users they provide injection rooms, fully staffed, to ensure people can be treated for OD, use drugs in a safe and clean environment, as well as rehab programs and accomodation if you would like to kick the habit. 

I cannot praise the staff enough at these rooms. They are non judgmental, friendly and well educated in the science and culture of addicts.  

The government health sector for the state I live in did the research and for every $1 million they spend on these NSP services, they save $1 billion down the track they would normally have to spend on treating drug users for chronic diseases. 

From chatting with you guys here and on other forums it doesn't sound like there is much health promotion going on in a good deal of countries. 

I'm actually really surprised because the state I live in is generally slower than the rest of the country in making smart choices. 

Can you guys tell me how it is where you are (you don't have to give me your address or anything, just keep it vague areas). I would like to know how you source your sharps and how you dispose of them and anything else interesting. Cheers :D

00:15- Nothing so far, started bumping some of my [opiate music](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7C57236546381F9)(check it out!), browsing reddit, the usual. 

00:30 - I may just be expecting it, but I feel a little heavier, not my usual full blown opiate calm, but definitely a little something.

00:45 - While extremely faint, there is a definite euphoric feeling. In fifteen minutes I'll finish the rest of the glass. I have a feeling that my infrequency of use and low tolerance has given me the upperhand here.

01:00 - Finished the rest of the glass. The buzz(for lack of a better term) has been slowly building for around 25 minutes. Still nothing extremely noticeable, but still a sign that it's working.

01:30 - Just keeps getting better and better, I've developed the itch. No serious nod however. 

In summary, I'd recommend these seeds. Another redditor even confirmed that they've worked for him as well. As always, stay safe out there, results can seriously vary depending on the batch. 

Happy nodding!

sh9hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/sh9hj/question_about_tolerance/,5,https://redd.it/sh9hj,meowkitty420,question about tolerance. ,"Allllright, a little backstory on my usage - im ~105-109 lbs, female, and I've been using opiates (insuffulation only) heavily since ~ Christmas '10. Of course I began with halves and quarters (DOC : roxi/oxycodone 30's) but eventually got up to doing 3.5 pills at once initially to get high, then anywhere from 1 whole pill to a quarter at a time throuought the day to keep my high going. (I.e. 3.5, hour and a half later I'll take a half, thirty mins later a quarter, hourish after that take a whole one...ect. ) SO - from such heavy use and my high (or what I consider high) tolerance, my script for 120 oxycodone 30's doesn't last me until my next refill. For a while, when my script ran out, I was purchasing anywhere from 4-8 (or more if I could) 30's off the street through my dealer, for $20(rare) , 25-30$.  I was spending at least 120$ and at the most 2-300$ a day on my habit. (i could not support such expensive of a habit) So I said fuck that, and starting buying H, eventually buns, that'd last me almost two days. I'll do approx 2 or 3 bags depending on potency and size of the bag in one line (insuffulate) to get my initial high, and then one bag here and there throuought the day to keep my high (like I did with the Roxie's). 

MY QUESTION: since I have been replacing the thirties with heroin  recently (because I can buy a bundle that lasts me ~2 days for 70-80$ instead of 7 roxi 30's for ~200$ that would maybe last me a day with nothing for morning)when I get my new script and go back to consuming my thirties ( Because they're basically free, and as of now I think I'd rather be doing them just because I know exactly what's in it, no cuts, ect.) since I have been doing H is my tolerance going to be higher since H is more powerful? 

Experts please help, I've been wondering since I began, and can't seem to get a straight answer from friends, or dealers, or anyone in that matter.  Please help me out  bropiates! You guys always have come through :) I look forward to answers and clarity with my tolerance inquiry <3 I'd thank you with my stash pic, but I can't on my iPad :( unless someone knows how to? thatd be cool too!!

From what I've seen, the seeds aren't washed, with little bits of plant matter seen here and there, but I have yet to actually brew the tea and try it out. I would like your input on the method I've scrounged up from some various sources:

* Take about a half pound to a pound of seeds and pour them into a container.

* Cover the seeds with about an inch of lukewarm water, and add some grapefruit/lemon juice.

* Shake vigorously for about 10-20 minutes. 

* Unscrew the cap so that it stays tight but allows just the tea to drip out.

* Drink.

* Nod.

Any advice/past experiences would be great. I know that, since this is my first time experiencing seeds, and specifically these seeds, I should take it very slow. If it helps at all, my current dosage for a good euphoria is around 25mg hydrocodone. Yes, yes, I know pods are the way to go, but they're extremely hard to come by, as well as expensive.

(As opposed to stims on their own.),"Quick backstory: kicked H(which was going from chipping to near daily use way too quickly for my liking) in mid-Feb.  Have been using subs at .5-2mg a day.

I'm narcoleptic, so I occasionally take Adderall or Ritalin if I really need to focus.  I hate the way the drugs make me feel in general, so I really only break it out when shit needs to be done yesterday.

Today, I was helping a friend edit his webpage, and we had about 4 hours worth of work and 2 hours to do it.  I was a bit hungover, too. At 3:30pm, I took a 10mg Adderall XR and had a medium coffee from Starbucks(where we worked) on top of that.  Earlier, around Noon, I had taken about 1mg of Sub sublingually.

Now, when I take my stim meds, I always get butterflies in my stomach, sweaty palms, flushed face, and worst of all elevated blood pressure, which manifests itself as the type of anxiety that makes it hard to take a deep breath.  After about 4 hours (even tho the XR claims to last 8-12), I usually get a bit down and really tired.

It's approaching 1am, so 9 hours on, and I just feel SOOO tight. Like every muscle in my body is balled up.  I tried sleeping, didn't work, popped 10mg of valium, didn't work, beat off, didn't work. Still as taut as a rubber band.

I've combined Adderall+sub, Adderall+coffee, and sub+coffee-never noticed an unusual reaction.  This is the first time I've had all 3 in my system at the same time.  So, my theory is there was some sort of bad reaction there.  The hangover didn't help either, I'm sure.  I did drink a TON of water today, though.

sl8x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/sl8x8/psa_overdosing/,37,https://redd.it/sl8x8,jmkogut,PSA: Overdosing,"Recently r/opiates has been absolutely flooded with posts detailing what posters are calling overdoses and discussing the ways they have treated these situations. More often than not, these claims include ""I was dead for X minutes!"" Where X is an obscenely inaccurate representation of how long you can stay under without dieing or acquiring severe brain damage. There is a difference between life threatening respiratory depression and simply taking too high of a dose and passing out. There are signs and symptoms of an overdose that are readily identifiable to the trained eye and contrary to popular belief, overdose cannot be treated merely by covering someone with ice and hitting them very hard in the face or genitals or even throwing them in the shower. There is a standard of care that should be followed and without proper medical training, equipment, and the facilities necessary to treat patients, that standard of care will not be met. **We strive above all else for harm reduction.** The following is a quick guide on *proper procedure*, I don't want to see more silly OD posts after this.

-----------------------

**What is an opioid overdose (acute opioid toxicity)**

Opioid overdose is relatively easy to define, and in fact identify once one knows the hallmark features. But, to simply define it, an overdose is any dose of an opioid that results in profound respiratory depression/arrest. Overdose results in other symptoms that may not be as easy to identify, but among them are bradycardia (low heart rate), severe hypotension, and cyanosis (when the victims lips/skin turns blue, they are cyanotic and need of urgent medical care). These are not the only symptoms. Others include unresponsiveness to light, heat, sounds, touch, etc. This does not mean ""spend 30 minutes putting the person in a shower, shoving ice in their pussy"" (420chan users, represent). This means shout their name, maybe slap their face a little bit just to see if they are aroused [ed: giggity] by it and say ""hey man stop slapping me alright?"" or something similar, that means it's not an overdose. Another hallmark is labored breathing, This may sound like snoring, and if this is the case, there are a few things that need to happen to ensure the person survives. Putting them in a shower, hitting them, shoving ice anywhere in their body, none of that will help and certainly no emergency room physician will instruct you to do that. Don't be stupid, this is a human life. 

**What should I do if I find someone who I believe has overdosed?**

This depends greatly on whether or not you're alone. Let's assume you are for a moment. FIRST, call 911, the police WILL almost always show up. If you have more than one person there, then hide the drugs. Generally, they're more concerned with saving that persons life than they are with fucking over drug users. If your friend dies while you were around and didn't call 911, you could easily be charged with voluntary manslaughter. I know someone this happened to. 

The second thing to do, in order to save their life, is to listen to the 911 dispatcher, generally they will advise you to perform CPR. Being that an opioid overdose causes respiratory issues, hands only CPR is not going to be sufficient. Rescue breathing will be needed. It is best(regardless of if you're a junkie or not) to be familiar with CPR/the rescue position/other basic first responder techniques. If you're friends with the person, they likely won't sue you.

If you are not alone, you should cycle doing CPR (it is exhausting, I've performed it on folks who have overdosed at or around the needle exchange I have volunteered for) until EMT's or police arrive and relieve you of that duty. The best way to go about the call is generally to say ""hello, 911? Yes, my friend is not breathing. His lips are blue and he is unresponsive. I do/do not know cpr, I need an ambulance, what can I do in the meantime?"" Do not mention that your friend just did heroin or whatever. Once the paramedics arrive (they have narcan, and narcan, unlike ice, actually does reverse overdose) tell them that your friend ""occasionally does opiates, like heroin, oxycontin, morphine,"" or whatever the case may be. They will see the symptoms, and with that knowledge, hopefully make the diagnosis that the person has overdosed. Regardless, if they do not, they have the tools and the means to keep the person alive until they reach an emergency room where the doctor WILL make that conclusion. You should not be fearful of this following you around for your life, but it will. I've personally overdosed twice and required ambulance rides to the hospital and a full week or two week stay. I'll get into the reasons why later. However, I will say, even after these overdoses I do not struggle with getting prescriptions for narcotics (I have ms contin, percocet, norco, opana, etc). They will generally send an addictionologist around to evaluate you or a psychiatrist, if you don't want to get marked as an addict, answer their questions in a way that doesn't make you look like an addict. [ed: easier said than done]

**What if my friend wakes up before paramedics arrive, does he still need medical attention? Why?**

YES. Why? Well, when once overdoses, it is a very serious trauma for the body to go through, many people who overdose aspirate(vomit and then that vomit infiltrates the lungs), I did both times I OD'd, if you aspirate during an overdose, it is likely you will get aspiration pneumonia, which is very serious in and of itself. There are other very serious and dangerous possibilities that you simply cannot diagnose unless you have access to a full lab for blood work, a radiology center for chest x-rays, etc. Other life threatening complications include further a further lapse into unconsciousness and unresponsiveness, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (just to name a few). This is why they like to keep people who have overdosed for a minimum of one night for observation. 

**But I/my friend was dead for 30 minutes! They woke up because we put ice on them and were fine! **

First of all, your friend wasn't dead, they didn't ""flatline"", and they didn't go into cardiac arrest. had they flatlined they would have needed even more than narcan to bring them back. During my first overdose I went into asystole, the treatment thereafter was much more complicated and the fact that I survived is very, very, very much so down to the fact that I made it to the hospital alive and without hesitation. (nobody waited around to call 911)

**How can I avoid overdose?**

In harm reduction, we have a saying, test shots save lives. I'm sure you've seen me or other users post that before, but it is some divine truth. Test shots DO save lives. Mixing substances, such as benzos, alcohol, muscle relaxants, cocaine, amphetamines, etc, also greatly increase the risk for an overdose, so if you do mix any of those with your dose of dope, cut the dose of either the opiate, the secondary drug, or both, at least until you're confident about increasing the doses.

*This thread is not intended to help those who attempt to overdose to kill themselves. In that situation, you need more than medical help and although I do understand your plight and have been there myself, you should contact a mental health provider or check into a psychiatric hospital. It is my experience that unless you want to detox, they will keep you out of withdrawal be it with methadone or suboxone or if you're a chronic pain patient (even if you abuse your drugs, don't mention that, just say you're a CP patient) and they'll give you your drugs as prescribed. *

If you are suicidal, please, please, please check out /r/suicidewatch.

And for everyone else, can we quit using overdoses as a junkie dick-waving badge of honor? Overdoses only occur when we fuck up and are nothing to be proud of.

I've never had a problem with addiction. My preferred method is to sniff my drugs, but I'm getting pretty bored of that and want to feel this rush I know IV use gives. The only person I know who shoots up is a junkie and is in jail now.

I understand that IV use decreases the length of time the high lasts but intensifies it and requires much less of the drug to get high. Is this right?

Do you think shooting up crosses some sort of line that leads to most people becoming a full-blown junkie or is it just another ROA that doesn't change the fact some people can handle their drugs and others can't?",1334973384.0

For me the most common other one is methamphetamine.  It's really prevalent and just sort of gets given to me for free and I'll generally shoot some.  I'm not a huge fan but it can be fun once in a while especially if I have some H.  I'll tend to do a bunch of speed 'till I'm really wired then shoot up enough H to where I'm really high or even nodding then do more speed so I'm not gonna fall asleep then more H cause I'm so wired.  Rinse and repeat.  That's only if I have a decent amount of both.  Also, I don't recommend doing that because it's a way that many OD, but if you do be safe and start small and know your tolerance, obviously it's one of those things I do anyway just like many mix benzos or alcohol with their opiates.  

If I have the money I'll generally get coke and do speedballs and while I prefer it to meth it's too expensive for that to occur often.  

Those are the main ones, I don't drink much (except recently once I had kicked), I pretty much only take benzos to help me sleep if I've done a bunch of meth or am withdrawing.

Advice needed!,"Hello fellow b/r/opiates I used to post in this subreddit on my main reddit account but recently had to make a throwaway for drugs because someone who as of now I used to be friends with found my reddit account and decided to look through my recent posts and attempt to humiliate me. Back to the actual story.

Today me and my usual pick up buddy were trying out a new connect I picked up over this past weekend. The first time I picked up from him I got a $50. I met him and he got it out, showed it to me, told me it was $50 worth and let me taste it. The second time, he asked if I could get him from a close suburb city and drive him to his house and he would give me $10 extra to however much I bought so I bought a $20 and he hooked it up with 30 worth, welcomed me into his house, while I watched him weigh it out and put it into paper for me.
Today my buddy wanted to get some with me and wanted to split on a g which he said would have to be $180 today because its some really fire stuff. That's fine with me cause g's can go up to $250 around here. We went to get it, he pulled it out, showed it to us, and we bought it. My buddy has been shooting for a few years now but is used to getting chunk instead of powder so he was unsure of what a G looked like to the eye in powder so it looked fine. We brought and back and put it on the scale to find that it only weighed 0.5. Obviously we were both pretty pissed and confronted him about it. Even called him and he kept saying it was 1.0 on his scale nothing more nothing less and went back and forth with us for 2 hours. He said that he wont get us back because we could have possibly taken some out or it fell out which many dealers would say in relation to dope. My buddy called him to let him know he would never buy from him again unless he made it right which the guy had nothing wrong with because he only met him once. On the other hand, he texted me saying that he really didnt shade me because he doesnt need to and that he wanted to sit down and talk about it over a blunt. So I said I would do that sometime later this week when I wanted more stuff.

sqese,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/sqese/back_on_the_dope_train/,20,https://redd.it/sqese,Morpheusz,Back on the dope train :(,"Lately I've been attempting to maintain being a chipper to keep a low tolerance, so getting high wont break the bank. 

But i always fail at chipping, once i started splitting oxy 30's once every two weeks, it leads to once every week, then whole pills, and eventually im going on pay cycle binges where i spend my whole pay check in a weekend.

Now im coming off my most recent pay cycle binge. I did 3 oxy 30's and 2 and a half grams of fire dope. I can burn through half a gram of heroin in an evening; which is sad because not too long ago i could get ripped off half a roxy. Now im broke until next friday and all I have is a small suboxone donation from a generous friend, which I am extremely grateful for at this moment :).
 
The dope i get is 100 bucks a gram and im pretty sure its #3 afghani and fairly pure. I can sniff .1 and smoke .05 off foil and thaf gets me pretty ripped. I basically only buy dope now, the oxy's are just too exensive. But, when I cant get dope i have to resort to the 1 dollar per mg oxy. Although i still enjoy the high from oxy more, to me its just a very special feeling. 

TL;DR: I sumbit a messy burenorphine induced rant to /r/Opiates about my stupid tolerance that no one probably cares about

About a month ago, I had about two 5/325 percocets (oxycodone) and I asked if that would be enough to nod. I didn't listen to one of the commenters and therefore felt nothing :(

Since then I have used percocets 3 times and felt pretty good twice.
I now have 7 of these same 5/325 oxycodone percocets on hand. I would appreciate any and all advice regarding method of dosing, amount of pills I should use, how to enjoy the high more, etc.

Thanks br/opiates. Love you guys. Great community we got here.
Also, any advice on dodging addiction would be great. While I feel opiates are great and all, I also think that they should just be a once in a while, special occaion-sort of thing lol.

But a couple weeks ago somebody owed me $20 and to square it he gave me a half gram of good* K. *(source: I have friends who have done the batch). 

I'm also hooked on morphine and occasionally bupe, both of which I have in steady supply. From skimming stuff from basic google results(bluelight, drugs forum, ect), I gathered that most people believed that opiates and K were not really the best drugs to do together... but since this was all anecdotal I figured I'd ask y'all. 

Opiates + Ket? Yay or nay? Would it be better if I was on the subs instead of morphs? Is ketamine even worth my time anyways?

So comments, stories, anecdotes, advice, ect.... please

edit: I never really wanted to combine the two in the speedballing sort of way. It was more of a ""I need to be on some sort of opiate or I'll get sick. Can I even try ket with opiates in my system?"" type of deal.

there's an unopened 10pack of generic 25mcg patches in my mother's discarded meds cabinet. NOT gel patches. it's been there for almost a year. it's getting to the point where nobody is ever going to touch them and i could probably take some then glue the box closed as if nothing ever happened.
  
1) my typical dose is an occasional 30-40mg oxycodone (oral) with various potentiators/beer. i've gone up to 60 over a couple hours without incident, but i was higher than i would have liked to be. i've been told that if i want to use a patch, i ought to have a couple 5s on hand to kick it into gear. is that solid advice? i'm really unclear on the conversion between oxy and fent and the calculator in the sidebar (which is otherwise totally rad) doesn't seem helpful since it only has IV and IM as the ROA. is it better to cut these up and eat them instead of just wearing the thing for 3 days?  
  
2) what should i expect? i've heard conflicting stories about levels of nodding and euphoria and it would be nice if i could hear from someone using the same patches who has around the same tolerance as me or at least someone who really knows WTF they're talking about.
  
3) wikipedia says the placement of the patch matters a lot. as in the fattier and warmer the spot, the more you absorb. is it better to put it somewhere fatty like an ass or hip, or is that potentially dangerous? what if i have a patch on while i'm out dancing and get all hot and sweaty? because sometimes that's all i want to do when i'm high.  
  
**edit: one more that's actually pretty important.** if i don't want to wear a patch for the full 3 days  and also don't want to waste any of it, can i cut one in half and still get the 25mcg an hour, or does will it cut the absorption in half?",1335429637.0

I've been taking oxycodone for a chronic pain issue for the last 1 year and 9 months. I've gone up from 20mg per day to 60mg per day over this period. I take 1 10mg pill about every 3-4 hours. I've long since lost the euphoria I used to get, but 60mg daily still does wonders for the pain.

Recently after missing some doses I got a bit concerned about tolerance and withdrawals so I decided to stop taking it. I went through a few restless nights and some fire in my legs, but for the most part it was only bad for 3-4 days.

My goal is to start taking less again because I've been feeling my temper getting shorter and shorter and I really don't like that.  

It's been 2 weeks since I took it last and the pain is coming back  pretty seriously. If I start taking it again now, will I undo all the ""good' I did by not taking it?

I have a basic understanding on down-regulation/up-regulation. but I have no idea how long it takes before I can start taking, say 40mg daily again for pain. My goal is not to get any euphoria here, it's just to cut down on the rage that comes with daily opiate use.

A while back I came across this guide of several methods to potentiate an opiate high. I did not write this myself but it really does work well. I reccomend this thread be stickied.....my bad if this has been posted before...



""Hi BLTC!

What's up. Haven't shown my face in quite some time, but I haven't died or anything. Been super fucking busy with work, school, and of course, drugs.

So, my opiate experience is now ridiculous. As some you may remember, I had a ""opiate potentiation formula"" that I thought was pretty damn good.

That was when my opiate use was, TOPS, once a month. Now, I use several times a week, and only to keep my tolerance from rising and to avoid becoming physically dependant do I limit my indulgence.

And, in my opiate-induced generally junk-driven journey's, I have seriously revised my famous formula. Here it is, in all it's new, revamped glory:

That said, to get the ABSOLUTE MOST out of your opiate, try N0 W4RN1NG's patented opioid potentiation formula:

* T-45) 600mg Tagamet HB(Cimetidine HCl), a large glass of tonic water (or another source of quinine), and a large glass of (white) Grapefruit juice, preferably from concentrate.
* T-35) 30mg DXM HBr, 4mg CPM, 25mg Benadryl(Diphenhydramine HCl), 330mg Naproxen(Aleve).
* T-20) 2 Tums OR 1.5 Tbsp. of Baking SODA. (Obviously this step only applies if you are eating your opes)
* T-0) Parachute\chew\rail\bang your opiate\opioid.
* T+10) Smoke a bowl or two. Not more, you don't want to over power it.

In depth explanation:

The Tagamet HB (Cimetidine) is a broad CYP450 inhibitor. This basically means it 'clogs' the enzymes that metabolize opiates\opioids and clear 'em out of the body. Tagamet HB tablets are 200mg each, so the recommended 600mg is 3 tabs. They're OTC, and you can get a box of 50 generic 200mg cimetidine tabs at CVS for like $5.49.

Quinine is an ingredient in tonic water, and functions the same way as Tagamet. It inhibits the CYP450 set, more specifically, CYP2D6. It doesn't 'clog' as many enzymes as Tagamet does, but it STRONGLY 'clogs' CYP2D6, which is the MAIN enzyme for opiates like oxycodone, heroin, hydromorphone, etc. A large glass of straight tonic water is plenty. I prefer the ""Vintage"" brand. You can buy a liter of tonic water at any grocery for like $2.00.

White grapefruit juice contains three ingredients that clog the CYP450 set. However, it doesn't clog CYP2D6 too well, which is the main one for most opes. It does strongly 'clog' CYP3A4 nicely though, and although that's almost an 'auxillary' enzyme for alot of opiates, it definitely helps out. Again, it's cheap. Go to any grocery store and you should be able to get a nice big bottle of 100% whitre grapefruit juice from concentrate for like $2.50-$3.50.

An important thing to note for the grapefruit juice is the percentage of juice. A lot of companies make ""White grapefruit juice"" that is basically water, corn syrup, and like 10% juice. This is almost a waste of your money. You want it to say 100% juice, and also, you want to make sure it's 100% white grapefruit juice! A very common business practice for juice companies is to create 'juice cocktails'. These are beverages that are MAINLY cheap filler juices like apple and pear, with the advertised fruit only partially accounting for that '100% juice' the bottle sports so vividly. Look in the ingredients list, and make sure the only juice in there is white grapefruit, preferably from concentrate.

Nutritionally, juices from concentrate are usually not as good. However, for one reason or another, grapefruit juice from concentrate can contain 25%-40% MORE naringin, bergamottin and dihydroxybergamottin; the three enzyme inhibitors present in white grapefruit.

Now, some of you may be wondering WHY 'clogging' these enzymes is so beneficial. Basically, by slowing or even completely stopping the metabolization of opiates, they last MUCH longer. Also, blood plasma levels of opiates have been shown to vastly higher when the CYP450 set is strongly inhibited; meaning their is a higher peak, and it lasts longer.

It's a win-win situation, trust me. ^_^

On to the other shit. Benadryl(diphenhydramine HCl) and CPM(chlorpheniramine maleate) are both over-the-counter anti-histamines that increase the analgesic and euphoric properties of opiates to some extent. They also help cut down on the ope-itch. In addition, these guys also slightly inhibit subset CYP2D6.

Seeing a pattern here?

DXM (Dextromethorphan HBr, Robitussin, Zicam, etc.[not that it needed an intro on this board]) has a special effect in this formula. Although it doesn't inhibit the CYP450 set to any appreciable extent, it does contribute to analgesia and euphoria for all major opiates. Also, it has been shown to prevent the build up of tolerance! 30mg of DXM a good half hour or so before dosing will definitely slow any tolerance build up if you use this method every time. And with opiates, that's a VERY big deal.

The Naproxen(Aleve) adds to the analgesia and euphoria. Aleve comes in 220mg tabs, so by 330mg I mean one-and-a-half tabs.

The tums\baking soda is only necessary if you're eating the opiates in question. Basically, they lower the PH of the stomach\GI tract [well, technically it raises the PH, but ya know what I mean] which allows more of the opiate to be absorbed into the blood.

It's fine to smoke a little bud, but too much ruins the high IMO. And when I say a little, I mean like .2g, tops. If you have a moster tolerance, titrate accordingly, but if you smoke a few times a week .3 will be perfect.

To further breakdown all this pre-dose potentiation, I'll make it easy for you guys and just tell ya how many pills to take, and the exact way I consume them

* T-45) 3 200mg Cimetidine pills, washed down with a HUGE tonic water\white grapefruit juice cocktail.
* T-35) 1 Coriciden Cough & Cold Low Blood Pressure, 1 Benadryl, and one and a half Aleve.
* T-20) 2 extra strength Tums if I'm popping the opes.
* T-0) Rail\pop those shits.
* T+10) *Smokes a bowl*

The Coriciden has both 30mg of DXM and 4 mg of CPM, so it's good for killin' 2 birds with one stone. No pun intended.

Also, some people are under the impression that all these drugs make the high ""dirty"". They CAN, no doubt about it, but in the dosages I listed, there are *NO* perceived changes in the quality of the high. It really does feel like you took more opiate, minus some itching.

Anyway, that's basically it! Hope I manage to help some of you guys out on your voyages to the land of nod, and if you have any questions, feel free to post.

And if this is too lengthy, it's because I'm yakked out of my skull PLUS 48mg hydromorphone; preloaded, of course, with my all-powerful formula.

...and I'm procrastinating for a paper due tomorrow morning. But that's besides the point. Peace!

N0 W4RN1NG

EDIT: Forgot to mention:

This formula should NOT be used in combination with codeine. Codeine's pleasurable effects are largely dependant on it's metabolization into morphine via CYP450 subsets. This formula basically fucks that shit up the ass. If you're using codeine, just take the DXM.

Also, if you plan on drinking alcohol, nix the Aleve. It can cause some nasty damage to your stomach in combo with alcohol. Same goes for APAP\Tylenol(acetaminophen), so if you're taking opiates with tylenol included (Vicoden, Percoset, Endocet, Tylenol 3, etc) be nice to your liver and don't drink. Liver failure is no picnic, mkay?""

I have always been interested in opiates, ever since high school, I knew that I'd never want to do LSD or party drugs, but rather something soothing. I have never done any drugs, besides the usual alcohol, caffeine and nicotine.

I have read A LOT about drugs. The reason I want to start with H is because I just want to try it, do it once and that's it. So I don't actually want to spend the next few years of my life on opiates and then end up using H. Since I only plan on doing it once (or if I get sick the first time, then as many times as it takes for me to get high off of it) I thought i might as well just do Heroin and stop being so curious. 

I do have a very addictive personality, but the thing is, I have the most wonderful life. I am not prone to depression at all, so I really don't think that I'd run to drugs to make me feel better about life, but rather just out of curiosity. However, I am not sure whether that makes any sense.

The thing is, I am in Europe, my friends don't even smoke weed, I have no idea where to get it and what to get and I'd have to do it on my own. So, could you please tell me things like how much I should do and what I should look out for? 

I might end up not doing it, but please try not to judge me or tell me that I shouldn't (unless you think I might OD because of no-tolerance, then by all means, do tell me that, since those are the kinds of things I am curious about), so please try to look at this as if there was nothing you could tell me that would make me not do it.

I <3 you all!

Of course, I'm curious to see what all the fuss is with the harder stuff, but this forum has done a very good job in helping me keep a cautious perspective and remain content for now. 

Even with just the codeine, its a bit scary sometimes how much time I dedicate to looking forward to my next high. I would say over the last couple of months, it has been the dominant prism through which I see my life a good deal of the time - and I have a family and great job.

I'm going to try and keep things short, as we all know our opiate saga's can get a little long winded...but, here's where I'm at:

Started using last year, around February for the first time - roxi 30's and opana 40's, crushing and snorting...during this time my usage cycle was use, enjoy, take a week or two break, repeat - I had been warned about withdrawal and I'm a highly educated individual, I would read up on it, I thought sure I could avoid the trap door beneath all our feet...then, had a bad bender, went for about a month with 3-4 roxi 30's per day and occasionally a panda when some events in my life went bad and I just wanted to escape...then, I ran out of roxi's and couldn't score for a few days, and went into fucking terrible withdrawals...NO ENERGY - moving 10 feet was very difficult, throwing-up, chills, sweats, no sleep, the whole shebang...it was my first real experience with serious withdrawals...and I had no idea just how bad they could get....after the first 2 days or so of serious withdraw and telling myself I could tough it out, I gave in as I was having suicidal thoughts to make it stop...a buddy of mine convinced me to go pick up a bunch of roxi 15's and 20's to use to taper off my use with.

So I did it, I started a journal (THIS IS HUGE, helps so much to write down and log your usage, it keeps you on track and lets you see your progress, if your trying to quit I highly recommend it, write down how many mg's you do and the date/time/ROA -it's just to easy to get fucked up and totally forget what you did), only took them via oral ingestion, and it worked! I started at around 20-40mg's per day coming from 120+mg's per day, that was enough to keep me from withdrawals, and eventually got down to 1-.75mg's per day, from which I was able to stop completely with only a minor rough 2 or 3 day patch after I completely stopped using.

I was clean for a few months, no problems, but then I relapsed, and I've been on the merry go round since....I don't IV - it's a rule I will not break because I know I'll like it too much, and it will fuck my life up. But snorting is bad enough, so anyhow, this brings me to where I am right now.

Last week on Monday and Tuesday I blew through around 10 roxi 30's - it's sad because my tolerance has gone up so much that I really wasn't that high from those, just felt good for 2 days and wanted to burn through em to get rid of em (if that makes sense...I'm sure some of you can relate)

I was able to score 3 8mg suboxone tabs. I know how buprenorphine works, I've had a good deal of experience with it. That said, I think it's greatest attribute is that you CAN'T GET HIGH on anything else while your on this shit, sure, there are exceptions to the rule, but you guys know what I mean. This really helps me, because from personal experience I know I can snort 6 roxi 30's and I'll feel nothing/very little from them If I've done 2mg or so of sub in the past 24hrs....really helps when I want to just say ""fuck it all"" and get high when trying to quit, cause, I can't.

Anyhow, I've been trying to taper down, on Wednesday of last week I started to feel the onset of withdrawal, I took 2mg of sub, waited an hour or so, and took another 2mg...

from there, I've tapered down to around .75mg and 1mg today, which means today is day 6 of me taking small amounts of sub, just enough to not withdrawal...

My gameplan is to continue to try and taper, until I can't physically cut the pill into smaller doses.

I feel certain this will work, and I'm hoping to not get addicted to buprenorphine during this taper, considering the timeframe of just over a week intended usage and the small amounts, I don't think I will.

Here's my issue. I know I'll be able to take a break and stop, but I also know eventually, probably a week or so after I stop totally, without withdrawal symptoms....I'll decide to get high and go buy some pills. This is largely because long after the physical w/d's are over, the mental depression of no opiates and nothing to look forward too (my life is....boring, right now..) I just know myself, and, I'll relapse, and use again....

I'm partially venting, partially asking for advice - I both love and hate opiates, I know I need to stop for good by simply looking at my bank account, but, it's soooo fucking hard - this coming from a guy who can stop for awhile....but eventually....I go back...knowing what awaits me - a warm blanket of comfort and happiness that temporarily blinds me from the troubles of my life, and the hell that awaits once I stop, and the pattern that repeats itself....over, and over, and over....

Ugh, sorry for the super long post, just seems so hopeless....

thoughts?

I've basically been using for the past two and a half years pretty constistantly, give or take a few weeks and 59 days I had clean from going to rehab in sept 10 and 6 months clean from august to march this past year. I came home and started using again occasionally and that led up to everyday. However the girl I'm currently seeing didn't like that I was using and so ultimately I've chosen her over opiates (2 weeks clean cold turkey off pans and roxs). I always had a pretty good sex drive, could easily get hard and cum pretty much all the time. When I came home and was using we had a great sex life. Now that I'm clean, I can't even get hard or stay hard. I got cialis from my doc (if you can't get clean for yourself, do it for others!) And all that did was get me hard and cum in 5 seconds.

So is this normal? Is my body and sex drive. readjusting from the lack of synthetic feel good chems my body has been adapted to?  Do you think they'd have a better answer in /recovery? If you need more details just ask and ill divulge.

i have a couple 25mcg/hour mylan brand fentanyl patches. not wanting to fuck with it while i was alone, i went to my boyfriend's house, cut one up and put a quarter of it under my tongue and began feeling slight effects after about half an hour. about 40 minutes in, i added another quarter and after an hour total, i was pretty high. as soon as it really kicked in, we went to bed. i typically take 30-60mg of oxycodone and am good to go, but this was a bit different. mainly because i felt pretty nauseous which usually only happens when i drink too much on top of my opiates. i didn't actually barf, but i got that weird, rising mildly stinging feeling you get when you know you better get up and get to the toilet ASAP. failed to barf, got back in bed, tried to avoid moving as much as possible and otherwise felt pretty nice. i had to try really hard to avoid nodding out because i had a weird feeling that it would be bad if i did.  
  
a couple days later i was hanging out with another friend and we both took between a 3rd and a 4th of a patch. he's a scrawny guy but didn't really get much effect because he has a decent tolerance, while i was somewhat more functional and comfortable but i did actually puke. felt fine once i did though. we got on the bus and headed up to a concert and after having a couple beers, the wobbly, fuzzy feeling sort of came and went in waves, but it was pleasant and i had no trouble playing sober. didn't stop me from being impatient with the trite 70's metal throwback i was seeing though. 
  
it seems to me that cutting them up and sucking on them is the way to go. try not to swallow too much while it's in your mouth because i'm guessing much of the nausea was due to it going directly to my stomach. i haven't tried just wearing it, but i'm sure this is much faster and more intense. an all-around better use of it. compared to what i'm used to, it's more a feeling of calm, quiet stillness than the general nice and warm feeling that i get from other opiates. there's totally a time and place for that, but the nausea is really putting me off it because i have such a little tolerance for puking and upset stomachs. i'm more inclined to try the terribly undignified and ritual-ruining plugging with these shitty morphine SRs i have than i am to do more fentanyl at this point in time. i have a full patch left and i'm going to see if i can trade it to my dealer friend for some computer work. i'm not too sure what it's worth though.

i've recently come across a decent supply of 5 mg percocets, and i have some questions.

i've ingested the pills on 4 or 5 different occasions, started at about 10 mg making my way to 40 per experience. normally, i would increase the dosage to at least 100mg, but as it was my first experience, i took it easy. 10 mgs did not sit well with me, inciting some nausea and discomfort in my stomach. because of this, i only slowly increased the dosage in hopes of achieving some sort of euphoria, but nothing. maybe if i take more, the euphoria would increase and eventually offset the nausea? 

now i find this strange, for me specifically. many people immediately assume im alergic to opiates, but i find this dificult to believe. on many occasions, i've enjoyed codeine and was even lucky enough to land a full bottle of hydrocodone, and enjoyed every single drop of that without nausea. after reading into the combination of oxycodone and acetaminophen - and it should be known that the little knowledge i do have on the subject was gained through casual research in my spare time - it seems there may be some sort of governing additive in the pill that would enduce nausea, essentially to discourage to recreational use of the drug. now, i'm not sure if this is true or not, because i have little to no knowledge in the field, so it would be nice to know if anyone know's anything about these specific pills. 

here is my next experiment. i have 200 OTC APAP/codeine/cafeine pills that i am going to preform a CWE on. i also have 6 of the aforementioned percs. i was going to conduct a CWE on the percs and ingest the solution along with the codeine and hopefully have a good time. i'm looking to ingest min. 150 mg of codeine, most likely arond 250. i'm 240 lbs and 6'5"", so i'm thinking even more than 250 mgs of codeine is a possibility, but maybe not if i am going to ingest the oxy as well.

TL;DR - prior experience with hydro (loved it), codeine, and a bad exp with oxy. looking to CWE 250 mg of codeine and 30 mg of oxy, and to ingest at the same time. good idea? bad idea?

I got my doctor to prescribe me 20mg methadone a day for my back pain. Its real, no fakes. I got the X-rays and MRI's to prove it, also a Ankylising Spondolitis (type of rheumatoid arthritis) diagnosis. Its about to be bumped to 30mg a day next week. Thats right, my doc (who knows about my past abuse, but also knows ive been 90% clean since Dec 31st) is giving me nearly a gram of take home methadone every month. Hes willing to work with me to get me proper pain relief. (He also thinks my habit wasnt as long or bad as it was, and that my time on subs was more for pain relief than maintenance)

Honestly, its amazing. I havent had appropriate pain relief since I was on subs, but even those werent enough. I have an appointment to get a new script for 3x10mg Methadone QD next week. Then at the next months appointment I can try to get some breakthrough meds =D, unfortunately because Ill probably need them. Id be happy with 30x10mg Percocets for fuck sake.

I wont really be abusing these, I just want some motherfucking relief for the daily motherfucking pain my back causes me and Im just so happy to have an understanding doctor.

Use a dremel to grind down the pill into a powder (really the only possible way you can do it).

Add about 100units of dry acetone (99% or better, if you cannot obtain this, dry the highest you can obtain with this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drierite)

Stir vigorously for about 10 mins, then heat the mixture to about 130F in a hot water bath.

Remove and continue to stir the mixture.

Continue these last two until you see most of the pill break down and dissolve into solution.

Filter the solution through filter paper (or coffee filters). Save the product IN the filter, as this is where the oxymorphone is.

If done correctly, the acetone(as anhydrous as possible) will have broken down the three main polymers in the pills, which are all soluble in acetone, and left the oxymorphone (and talc, and a few other binders) intact.

Let the powder from the filter dry out a bit, and it will be snortable as is.

The reason this works, is because the 3 main polymers that are used to make this horrible pill are soluble in acetone (and maybe even IPA, but I am not sure), while oxymorphone is not. This is also why you cannot use wet acetone, as the Oxymorphone will just go into solution with the other shit as it is soluble in water.

This might work without having to first grind down the pill, but will probably just take longer.",1336055365.0

So basically I was supposed to run out next monday, I didn't get prescribed a refill.  I actually am in pain and have been taking them right...but I ran out cause I gave some to friends stupidly thinkin it would be cool to hook them up...

Anyways I didn't take any of the ibuprofen yet so I can just take those starting tomorrow and hope that gets me through till monday because my sockets feel like there is some real pressure and causing me pain.  

What is the best way to go about asking for a refill for the vicodin?  Did a google search but got a lot of stupid bullshit that is unrealistic...is it better to set an appointment cause of the pain and ask while there or just call and ask?   Should I mention the vicodin specifically or just say I am in real bad pain? I have no drug charges and have never used painkillers recreationally but I enjoyed the experience of the vics and would like to reduce my pain and have some fun at the same time...I probably won't see this dentist again as I have a different regular dentist this guy is an orthodontist so I don't really care what he thinks about me if he denies me.  Thanks for any help!

**TL;DR** I ran out of vicodin and I want to know how to get the best chances to get my orthodontist to prescribe me with a refill.",1336187557.0

According to the opiate comparison chart, oral morphine is roughly half the strength per mg of oxy (~5mg oxy is ~10mg o-morph).  Is it really that simple?  Am I missing something?

If it all checks out, then morphine is 5.46 times cheaper than oxy, while only being 2 times less powerful.  So I should just buy morphine, right?  Any thoughts?
My tolerance is low, if that helps this at all.  ~40mg oxy has me sitting pretty high.

This never happened to me before, I always got my stuff.

So yeah, on friday my first WDs ever kicked in and I am over the worst by now. Still haven't slept, restless legs syndrome (I have always had RLS since I can remember and this ruined many a night for me) so bad I wanted to hack off my feet and hands, because even constantly moving and stretching didn't bring relief. Stupid me also ate some Diphenhydraminhydrochlorid tablets (otc sleeping pills) because I thnought they would actually make me sleep. No. All they did was make my RLS even worse. So I googled it and tada - the stuff makes RLS worse. You can't imagine how fucked over I felt, trying to escape the RLS and ending up boosting it. After about 15 hours of standing up to escape the pain, and then lying down again from exhaustion only to have to stand up again... Fuck. 

After a while I started hyperventilating so I went down to the hospital. They couldn't help me because no Doctor was there?! So I took a cab to the next hospital where the doc said he could only give me Methadon after a 24h waiting period because of opiates still in my system blabla and I would also have to check into closed psych ward for 21 days. Wouldn't even give me anything like benzos or smth for RLS. Screw this, took a cab home. At least this escapade made time pass a little faster.
Fast forward to now, the worst seems to have passed. Sleep still out of the question though.

How about $15 for 20 mg ER opana (new abuse-proof formula),"i've never tried oxymorphone before, but I am curious (especially reading all the posts from people talking about how awesome they are). Is it even worth it if I don't want to IV them? I take  20 mg OC extended release (2 - 4 a day), and 10/325 norcos (probably around 3 - 5 a day) for reference. 

Edit: Okay so I went out and got 8 of them plus 1 ER for 120 which it seems like everyone thinks is a good deal (kind of makes me wish I got more :X). I wish I got the stop sign ones because I always thought they looked really cool but they are round white generic ones. I'm not sure how much to take and what way I should take them. I won't be taking them orally as 10% BA is garbage, I see 43% being thrown around as the BA of taking them intranasally. I won't IV them. Does anyone know the BA of plugging them? I do hesitate to do this but if snorting them won't do any good then I might as well get my money's worth... Also, does anyone have a recommended dose for a first time user?

I've got pretty much no tolerance, at all. I'm pretty experienced with mind altering substances in general, but opiates are pretty hard to come across where I am, so I'm just lookin to get some advice from the experts.

However, I've come across some 15mg oxycodone pills, I've verified what they are and everything. Greenish pill, V on one side, 48 11 on the other.

15mg seems to be a pretty high dose for someone with no tolerance, but is it dangerous? I should be able to snort half one and eat the other half and have a pretty good time, right?

I'm 5'10, ~150 pounds if that has any influence on it.

Any tips, words of advice, or wisdom from all you experienced people?

Thanks everyone.

EDIT: Just took half of a pill, waited till I was buzzing pretty good then I snorted the other half, and took some hits off my MFLB. Holy shit, I can see how people get hooked on this. I'm gonna be careful with these...

EDIT 2: About an hour and 15 minutes after taking one, I started feeling really nauseous and I ended up throwing up. Feel great again. Too big of a dose for no tolerance, should've eaten something before I took it, but ehhh whatever I'll learn.",1336259237.0

He called me to come over so he could give me a couple of bottles which was quite an exciting prospect but as I arrived at his home I walked in on him prepping his rig to IV somewhere in the neighborhood of 80mg of methadose, which if you've been around this sub long enough you will know what a bad idea this is. I immediately slapped it out of his hands (which he didn't take too kindly to) saying ""BAD DOGGY! NO! BAD!"" and showed him the pictures of jmkogut's arm (can't find the link at the moment but hopefully he'll be kind enough to post them in the comments, but FYI they're are NSFL.) He had a panic attack over what he was about to do to himself (plus he can't handle gore which made it even worse.) If I had arrived 5 minutes later he could have lost his arm...or worse. Anyway, I'm posting this out of character to give kudos to jmkogut for making an example out of his mistake for all of us to show dire consequences involved with this decision and to aid in discouraging this outstandingly dangerous attempt to get high.

he welcomes Death with open arms


and open lungs


flirting, daring Death to take him


hastily gulping, breathing in every atom


 lustily pursuing every last drop of darkness


teasing Death with the tip 


of his tongue.


Death is not cold and dark, but rather quite warm.


Death itches.


Death tastes sweet


like honey and earth


Death makes him want to cough.


but Death, in all its sickness, brings tranquility 


for the glorious fleeting duration of a held breath


as he exhales


smoke rises upwards, free.  


but his troubles remain

And the second poem:**


A smooth, silky, seductive ocean


Whitecaps frothing with nothingness, emptiness, complete ignorance


Complete dependence 


This sea is a warm mistress


Artificial happiness

We were at the frolf course chiefing after popping the pills and a couple bowls we were walking back to the car and I began to hear a loud ringing which turned to complete hearing loss. Then my vision began to fade away from me until I was completely blind. In front of like 30 people I completely lost my hearing and vision and stumbled around for like a minute completely out of it. I ran into like 3 different cars before my friend finally stuffed me in his car and drove off. There was a tightness in my chest the whole time and I had the feeling of completely losing control. But after about 5 minutes of sitting in the car I was back to feeling fine. So any ideas on wtf happened to me? I feel so embarrassed and foolish for trying drugs and not knowing what would happen.

I got some great responses and I'm really glad I found this sub.  Just wanted to update you guys and give some advice to anyone trying it for the first time.

Like I said in that post, I've got a low tolerance and use about 10mg a day of oxy in the form of Percocets.  I started with a 1cm x 1cm square of the patch on my inner lip.  I didn't swallow and gave it about 30 minutes.  I didn't feel anything so I tried another 1cm x 1cm square.  Another 20 minutes and I was feeling warm.  I was starting to feel like I was getting a handle on how strong this patch is.  I went with a 2cm x 2cm square and finally got some euphoria. Finally, after another hour, I went with another 2cm x 2cm square and actually nodded some.  I know my tolerance is pretty low but I have been using the Percs daily for months, since before the holidays last year.  Still I can tell this stuff is quite powerful.  I'm pretty stoked since I have so much of it.  I've got great self control for a user so one patch should last me a week and then I'll switch back to pills.  

Long story short, Fentanyl is crazy potent.  Even these new types of patches where you can't extract the goo are fun recreationally.  If you have a low tolerance just use a ridiculously small amount at first.  Unless you're very experienced I wouldn't go smoking or cooking this stuff.  I used about 1/10th of the patch on my inner lip and had a great night.  I hear Fent can take your life away quick and I believe it.  My breathing was much slower than usual and I had to pay attention to it.  Don't go eating a whole patch unless you know what you're getting in to.",1336716784.0

Do **NOT** drive under the influence of opiates.

I totaled my car this afternoon. My head went down in a nod for a second and the next thing I knew, my car was over the curb, on the grass, and smashed into lovely tree right into the center of the hood. Thankfully by some chance I'm alive. If there were to have been a passenger he/she would have been dead. All I came out with was a cut lip and bruised Face. First thing I did was take my Metal water bottle filled with my stash and chucked it into the woods before people started to show up. Hopefully it's air tight enough!

So remember r/opiates. Use your better judgement along with the sober judgement of a second or third party before getting behind the wheels. You never know when a nod decides to show up and for all you know you may be on a crowded road. Or surrounded By asshole drivers. Or New Jersey.

Edit: I was going 35/40 miles an hour and i was supposed to be making a right turn onto a street right before the road veered left and my eyes and head fell for a split second as i was supposed to make the turn and instead of turning i went straight up the  curb. I tried breaking but the grass was too wet so I just slid into a tree. ",1336773663.0

All I can say is it warms me to see such compassion and understanding amongst a group of strangers brought together by love and addiction for a variety of substances. 

I'm certain that many of you think or have thought back to when you first started using and wondered how different your life could have been had you stopped or never even started.

This often brings one's attention to the negative aspects of your opiate riddled life. Removing the negative aspects caused by opiates does not always bring about the positive. I do the best to bring awareness of not only the bad but the good of every aspect of my life. Not everything in life is going to be perfect or always happy so understand that. Yes, the presence of negative things also means the presence of positive ones as well. It's up to you to find this presence and even create your own as well as dive into the negative aspects of ones life and personality and learn the kind of person you are and begin self improvement no matter how daunting a task it may seem. 

Just think about the bond opiates have brought you to this community as well as the new friends made. After all it's nice to know there's someone out there that's going through the same bliss and same Hell. Having someone to relate especially on such a taboo subject in today's society is a great feeling. Think of the MRSA you didn't contract thanks to the help of one of the greatest MODs on reddit.  I can only imagine the thousands of junkies out there that aren't aware of r/ opiates existence and the thousands more that had nothing even close to something like it in thierr lives way back whenever. Shooting up based on word of mouth and notes from your favorite William S. Burroughs writing. Think of the saved lives thanks to the help of r/opiates.

I've got two friends who have been arguing over this, and I find myself unable to be completely sure about my own opinion.

Obviously, dope is unregulated, cut, who knows what you're getting and where it's coming from...

But IV pills is supposedly rather dangerous as well with the binders and fillers and what not...

I find myself sticking to the roxies these days, as I am making a little bit more money and have MAJORLY cut down my use, literally one or two shots a day for two-three day runs, followed by almost a week of nothing. So far it's working for me, and I feel incredible health wise compared to when I had a bundle a day habit...

I find the reliability of dosage, cleanliness, and the confidence I have in myself for filtering before injection to leave IV roxies much more appealing. Plus, I like the blue or green liquid if they happen to be those kinds... I suppose my opinion might differ if I had reliable access to high quality dope, but I have to drive over an hour for poor quality and expensive.

An example is when watching a tv show, if a particularly annoying advert comes on, I become unable to verbally hold back the rage at this insignificant event.

Things like making spelling mistakes and having to correct them, having to look for stuff - when sober these are non issues. When opiated, they can even cause me to fly into physical violence at the nearest object!

It doesn't feel so bad though, it feels like a kind of self-righteous anger, almost like an indulgence in itself.

However, it does mean that I become foul mouthed when on the substance. Also, this didn't used to happen.

I have found a way to keep my opiate addiction under control to the point where I know what I need to get through the week, I tried to instill this in him but I guess I failed. I helped him out over the past few months when he was low and never really bothered him about getting them back to me but at the same time made sure he knew I was expecting them back at some point. I had some unexpected bills and told my friend that I really need those back because funds are gonna be low this week. He said no problem. A few days later we were gonna pick up some stuff so I gave him money to get me some and told him to just throw in there what he owed me. He once again said no problem. He goes and gets it and comes back and just throws me the container and said he had to be some where. I few minutes after he leaves I open the container and it's short what I gave him money for on top of him not getting me what he owed. So I call him and he doesn't answer for the rest of the day. He hasn't picked up my calls in a week now and every time I drive past his house his car isn't there. I spoke to the dealer just the other day and he said my friend has been there 4 times this week and took a loan from him the last time. 


At first I wanted to kick his ass because I have helped this kid with so much stuff even besides opiates but after the anger faded I realized that isn't the answer. I thought he was taking about the same amount as me or less but obviously he isn't. At this point I want to just sit him down, let him know that I am not mad and understand why he did what he did but that he needs to go get help. As much as I want to do this, I feel I will come off as a hypocrite and he wont listen. Any other way you guys can think to handle this?

I decided to quit opiates.  I had been smoking oxycontin and fentanyl on a daily basis(80-160 mg of oxycontin, 100 mcg fentanyl) for a little less than a year. 

The decision to stop was an easy one, my habit was costing me more than I could ever make at my job or steal in randoms places.  My physical appearance was becoming quite scary (not that I really cared), I went from weighting 195 lbs to 135 lbs, emotional attachment was impossible, and I was simply tired of living that life.  

I moved in with my parents, and when they started to notice I wasn't feeling well, I confessed to them the real reason why I moved back. Not all parents would have acted like they did, but they made it their mission to get me out of that situation.  For that, I thank them everyday.  

Now, what I really want to say is that if somebody reads this post and is thinking about quitting opiates, please do so.  It would be completely illogical of me to start listing the reasons why it would be a good idea, but in this day and age, there is no reason to have to wake up every morning with opiates on your mind.  As I mentioned earlier, it has been 10 months,  it is not a record by any stretch, but I have to admit, I have never felt as great as I feel now.  When I go to bed at night, I don't think about how I am going to get my next fix, when I wake up I don't stress about how long I will have to wait to receive a txt from my dealer.  I wake up and I feel alive, I feel like I belong, and even though life can be a bitch sometimes, I can still thank myself and the people around me for helping me get out of that world.  

The first few months after I quit, I didn't think I would ever be happy to live without opiates, but guess what? That's bullshit, you create your own happiness, you can control you life.  Do you really want to be a bitch to the needle you whole life?  

I guess I wasn't the only one to notice my new found happiness, I met the girl of my dreams, somebody who doesn't quite understand what I went through but still tries to relate.  All these things that have happened in the last 10 months make me glad to be where I am.  I don't have a perfect life, I still get bad grades in school, I still have shitty days, but now those things don't seem so bad, as a matter of fact, I'm quite glad that I can have a horrible day and not have to bury my thoughts in fentanyl smoke.  I am no longer numb to my emotions, and that makes me happy.

I do understand that not all addicts want to or are ready to quit, it is after all one of the most wonderful feeling in the world.  But, if you are an addict reading this and you want to change your life, then do it.  It won't be easy and you'll often feel helpless and stressed beyond anything you have ever felt, you may become depressed, you may want to end it all.  But when you start to notice that you can get out of it, there is no better feeling.  When you stop making your life revolve around opiates, your whole outlook on life will change.  And is there a better time to quit? Summer time is coming around, do you want to miss out on sunny summer days by lying in your dark bedroom waiting for a fix that will only last a few hours??

These buggers are obviously impossible to crush into a usable form and are so malleable that they refuse to even be cut into smallish pieces. I then decided to break out my favorite tool, the dremel. I used a small medium grit grinding wheel and shredded the pill into an extremely fine powder in <15 seconds.  

I did a 10mg bump of uncrsiped powder and it quickly gelled in my nostrils (fail), followed by a bump of a crisped powder (similar to an OP80)- also a failure it honestly just made the powder harder to deal with. The next day I took 20mg of powder and mixed it with half a powdered percocet- the results are AMAZING adding the dry powder to the mix somehow kept the oxymorphone from gelling in my nostrils at all! It took about twice as long to come up, about 10 minutes, but I can honestly not tell the difference in potency between the new and the old formulations. Finally I can enjoy my favorite opiate again!

It all started a few days before new years (2012). Me and my dumbass friends got the cops called on us, and we were sitting out on my friend's porch talking to them about what had happened. (Some spray painting... but that's not important). We had obtained some nice Cuban cigars a couple days prior to the run in with the law, and my friend had a little cigar band thing on his finger, wearing it like a ring. The cop noticed it and asked where he had got it from. My friend tried bullshitting, but the cops said they saw some ashes from cigars at the scene of where we had spray painted. The cop asked my friend to take him back into the house where the cigars were located, my friend complied. My friend had a whole setup in his fucking room... Pyrex glassware that had been used to make DMT many a time before, poppy seeds in a drawer, marijuana seeds as well, some DMT, and I think there were a few roxies in the drawer as well, and a large baggy of mimosa hostilis root bark just laying out on the floor in plain sight. Luckily my friend was able to give the cop the cigars without any of the other things being discovered. His mom proceeded to ruin the remaining cigars, thus ruining our nice Cuban cigar we planned to smoke on new years. And after that was done, the cop started lecturing my friends mother about how the Pyrex glassware could be used as a BONG... Ahaha.
 
So that was my hopefully entertaining story. (Not completely opiate releated, but hopefully you guys will enjoy it).

Hopefully I won't receive too much shit for posting this on r/opiates. Oh well.

I just sit around, bored as fuck, crying, sad. I don't want SSRIs (been on 'em, almost committed suicide), and I don't want mood stabilisers (been on 'em, turned me into a zombie).

Right now, I just have to sit around until [hypo]mania kicks in, and then I'm great. And then depression hits back and I suck.

I take a bit of hydro to stop the worst of the depression, to stop crying. What else should I try? I've heard MDMA can work, but might also leave you more depressed. LSD works fantastically for a day, but the next day it's back to normal.

I had already ate and smoked the gel out of the patches throughout the day at work. Work was over but I decided to do some overtime, so I headed out to my car to chew on some pieces of a patch.  It was a hot summer day so I had the car running and the AC cranked that day.  I cracked the window and smoked a cigarette then promptly put the window up.  I pulled out some pieces of a patch and started munching away. The next thing I know, I'm in the back of an ambulance and a paramedic and cop are asking me what happened.  They just tell me to be honest because I'm not going to jail.  At that moment I had no idea what happened, so I just sat there, then it all started coming back.  I realized I just overdosed.  

I had overdosed and was all alone in a parking lot because it was after hours at work.  My car was running and I was inside with the doors locked.  Once I fell out, my foot hit the accelerator and the engine started revving and redlining .  There happen to be some apartments by the parking lot that I was in.  A woman who lives there heard the commotion and walked over to the parking lot to see what was going on.  She looked in my window, saw that my lips were purple and I was unresponsive, so she called 911.  She also happened to see the wrappers to the fentanyl patches, being that she was a heroin addict, she relayed that information.  A cop shows up first before the ambulance, my doors are locked and he can't get in my car.  The cop busts out my back window, unlocks the car, and drags me out just as the paramedics show up.  They immediately hit me up with narcan, and I come to immediately, feeling like absolute shit. 

After I was conscious, I started putting the pieces back together and figured out what happened by asking them what exactly happened.  I think I would have died, had it not been for a heroin addict who found me and knew exactly what to do.  I ended up meeting up with her later so I could thank her.  Oh, and I got some benzos from her.  ",1337178431.0

Said my pulse was fine, but breathing was like 7 breaths a minute.  Luckily I told her where I kept Narcan at, it was one shot worth and she's a nurse so she gives it to me.  I jump up and instantly dope sick, but it feels like EXTREME dope sickness.  Like coming off a 5 bundle a day habit and I get like a 10mg piece of a fentanyl patch to chew on and the ambulance shows up.  I'm nodding out the whole way to the hospital and then I get there, they make sure i'm not trying to kill myself intentionally and keep me for observation for like 8 hours or so.  I instantly fall asleep as soon as I lay on the bed I fall asleep.  I wake up around 4:30AM and ask if I can go home, they say Yes and let me leave and here I am.  I'm done you guys, i'm gonna ween down off methadone and get on suboxone or maybe or just seriously commit to the treatment program because i'm not ready to be completely opiate free because my whole household is hooked and it's all I hear all day.

did i mention i love everything?

EDIT: okay, i was lenient with the first comment because the guy was quick and caring about it, but i understand about these drugs. i knew they were in my cabinet for months before i ever actually opened the container. i have done extensive research and i am a careful man. i have been on two of the best oxycodone highs ever and when i came off i returned to my life and thought, ""wow, that was a nice treat. would be nice to do every once in a while"". while that is *completely* open to change and i'm certain almost all of any addict ever started out that way, i don't need to be preached to. friendly reminders are okay, but i am in control of my life whether you doubt me or not. in spite of all that, i seriously appreciate the concern. being surrounded by people who care this much is all the more drive to keep my usage in control.

**EDIT 2**: this thread kinda spiraled out of control. everyone who i just thanked for introducing me to a cool drug that i tried once thinks my life is in the trash. i'm sorry everyone, but i just set up a deal to sell the rest of my pills. yeah, i don't have any pills left to take. so how the fuck am i going to get addicted? i'm sorry if every single one of you is going through a hellish addiction problem, but not everybody is the same. and now that i come out of my shell and get angry after people start making blind assumptions about my life, of course i start getting downvoted. i thought you were all at least respectful, but no. you're either addicted and in this hell that other people aren't allowed in, or you ""haven't gone deep enough in the rabbit hole"". well, i was capable of leaving the rabbit hole. sorry to disappoint all of you who were thinking i was doomed. a simple thank you turned into a fucking firefight.",1337126376.0

I have been diagnosed with depression for over half my life (I am middle aged).  As is the case with many of you (I'm guessing), nothing on this planet cures your emotional pain / depression as opiates do.  No anti-depressant, no amount of psychoanalysis, no attempts to change your ""lifestyle""....nothing.  When you take an opiate you do feel high, but a large part of that high is that you are excited about life and become enthusiastic and functional.

I recently read about a surgical procedure that involves inserting electrodes into an area of the brain called the Brodmann Area 25: http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/14/health/battery-powered-brain/index.html .  I am extremely interested in this procedure and was wondering if any of you were as well.  I have no idea if they would consider performing it on a person with a history of drug abuse.  Also, I am sure that even if someone were to get the procedure done, there would still be behavior modification necessary to correct the addict's instinct towards using.

My opiate use has caused so much damage to the people I care about that it goes beyond description (and I am sure my story is probably very similar to many of yours).  My question is- how many of you would go to this extreme?  Does anyone have further information on this?  Have any of you tried ECT for depression?  If so, has it curbed your drug cravings?

The vet gave one of our horses a shot and it had an allergic reaction to it. The horse ended up having  a seizure on top of my mother! When she was brought to the hospital they wanted to take her leg and she said NO! they said she would never walk again and she said Fuck You!! My mother ended up getting 8 bone graphs to repair her leg. She had 6 huge metal pins in her leg for months and I was so little that I said she was not my mom and she was a monster because the pins were so big. She did walk and she has been a nurse all this time. fast forward to a couple weeks ago. My mother had knee replacement surgery on the same leg she almost lost all those years ago. Because of her constant limping she needed to have it done BAD! Now she has been in on the tiniest amount of hydrocodone you could take and sometimes she breaks it in half cause she cant stand to be dizzy. Now on Monday she needed a refill and they wouldn't give her one. They were trying to figure out how many she had and how many she had taken and oh her doctor is not in right now and all that crap and she needs to wait till Friday. My mother's knee is swollen and she is on crutches going to physical therapy like three times a week and they would not refill her script and treated her like a junkie. This pisses me off more than anything in the world that people who need it have to go through such a hassle to get the relief they need. Sorry for the rant but God Damn It!!

I don't want to bite the bullet and sell the roxi for dope after work unless it just won't help, because I know I'm getting shit any way and it was free, so I don't need that advice, but thanks.

Also, I know I can find a few methods easily, but does anyone who does roxi more frequently have a link to an ""end all, be all"" injection guide for the utmost yeild? It's an A/215. Also, I have no qualms about certain unsafe practices such as heating the pill, by the way.

Do you see it as being weaker than Children’s brand Motrin? Do you see it as the drug of choice for thirteen-year-old boys? Or a boring, substance that gives people more seizures than an episode of Pokemon? Needless to say, tramadol has a pretty bad rep. But Tramadol is more than that. 

It is great for those days when you want to be fucked up but not too fucked up, a drug for those times when you want to nod but not nod as if you were a narcoleptic at a public reading of Moby Dick. Tramadol produces a beautiful high consisting of different “periods” of serene, halcyon waves of contentness enveloping around your body and your mind, and stimulating, invitalizing moods where you want to talk to everyone, clean every spec of lint stuck to your towels, and complete all you need to do with ease and a big smile on your face. 

Tramadol is the energizer bunny of the opiate world. Instead of lasting a couple of unsatisfying hours or even minutes, it lasts practically all day. Sure, tramadol won’t give you epic nods like heroin or give you godlike euphoria like oxymorphone, but it’s still a pretty good drug that shouldn’t be treated as the annoying, red-haired cousin of the opiate world.

He was in constant excruciating pain. He decided to opt out of the majority of the treatments after being told that there was essentially no way, even with a miracle, that he would survive; he wanted to die at home with his friends and family, not in a hospital bed. Because of the pain, which the doctors told us would probably be regularly an 8 on a scale of 10, Joe was prescribed a plethora of opiate pain killers including 80 mg OxyContin, 30mg IR Oxycodone for breakthrough pain, MS Contin 200mg, Diluadid in solution which he learned to inject himself in the hospital, and the old Opana 30's. He had so many different medications because he had numerous oncologists, pain management docs and GP's frequently by his side. I guess the doctors tend to be pretty lenient with the opiates they prescribe when you're pretty much guaranteed to die. So that's a bit of back story, now onto the good stuff, Joe's final gift.

Today I was cleaning my bathroom when I saw these goofy Family Guy [Pants](http://i.imgur.com/aizkV.jpg), hanging on the hooks on my bathroom door.

My Paypal history with my preferred pod vendor is the most accurate record of everywhere I've lived -- old apartments and zip codes -- cities and towns I've passed through quickly and forgotten.  I've tried almost every opiate under the sun, and   have never been physically addicted or gotten into trouble because of them.

Anyhow, if you are into pods, you know what happened to them.  My last order of pods, a couple of months ago, ran me $140 and got me high twice.  Fuck that.  I've been missing opiates lately, often going online to discuss them and to whet my appetite.  

So, I decided to finally bite the bullet and take a trip to NYC to buy heroin.  I bought a bus ticket online, and made arrangements to stay with a friend for a few days.  The ride is a couple of hours from where I live.  I wrote down the address of a needle exchange, thinking that maybe if I hung around there I could strike up a conversation with someone who could help me find heroin.  However, I had  reservations about trying to obtain heroin at a needle exchange, as I find it distasteful and kind of rude.  On the bus ride over, it was overcast, drizzly.  On the bus, I reflected on the “how to score dope” posts that I've read that offer advice of varying quality on how to buy drugs on the street as safely as possible while I looked out at the signs of gas stations and McDonald's and Wendy's passing by outside.

I know heroin exists where I live, but my timidity when it comes to asking the “right people”, my clean-cut appearance, and my general lack of street skills have rendered finding it locally, so far, impossible.  On the bus ride over, I grew determined to find heroin while I'm in the city.

When I got off the bus, it was still early afternoon.  My friend was working until later, so I decided to walk around Manhattan and see if any opportunities would present themselves.  The first person I came upon was begging for change at a street-light.  When the light went red, she'd walk up the line of cars, soliciting change with a plastic McDonald's cup in hand.  She'd walk the line of cars front to back, stopping to pick at her teeth for a minute in the mirror of a parked white van while she waited for the light to turn red again so she could repeat her walk.  She was white, in her late-twenties or early thirties, and had the recognizable unwashed appearance of a homeless person or stereotypical street addict.  She had sores on her face that I found unappealing.  I dropped a crumpled dollar in her cup and asked her, nervously, if she knew “where the dope spot was at.”

She said that she didn't do that stuff anymore, that she's in a methadone program now.  She seemed suspicious. Methadone is a subject I'm interested in, and we got to talking.  We discussed the length of the methadone detox, the rules of the program, the process of tapering off.  I asked her about the quality of the local powder heroin as compared to West Coast Tar.  I put another dollar in her cup and reminded her that I'm just looking for twenty dollars of “dope,” and am not trying to pull any funny business or anything, and I'll give her an extra twenty dollars for her trouble.  I feel a pang of guilt, thinking that if she really is on the methadone program and trying to stay clean, twenty dollars in cash might be a huge temptation for her.  She looked and me seriously now and said: “You'll really give me twenty?  People out here usually hardly give me anything.”  I could tell that, even with her suspicions, when she heard that I'd give her twenty bucks, it was too much to resist.

I pulled my pocket open so she could see I had two twenties in tow.  Her posture changed.  She bent forward, a rocket ready to fire into space.  “Alright.  Let's go.”  I was tagging along beside her, trying to keep up.  We jay-walked.  We jay-walked again.  A car honked.  A hot-dog vendor yelled.  My heart was pounding at the prospect that I might have actually started the chain of events that would lead to having heroin in my pocket.  She checked every machine we passed by with a change-slot:  pay-phones, electric parking meters.  In the payphone, she picked up the receiver, and began to dial.  She paused.  “You know what? I have two bags on me.  Just give me the twenty for the two I have, is that cool?  Will you still give me the extra twenty?”  And, of course, I said yes.

She passed me a clear plastic bag.  It was about the size of a baseball card.  Inside were two folded up wax-paper bags stamped in bold purple: “Purple Label.”  Even heroin, it seems, has a brand name.  The bags were about the size of postage stamps.  I quickly stuffed it in my pocket, my greedy left hand feeling for the bags inside.  She cracked a warped smile and yelled “Enjoy!” like a T.V. grandmother might say after setting down a plate of piping hot oatmeal cookies. She said “I'm always around here, if you want to come by tomorrow.”  I walk away, quickly, a shit-eating grin plastered on my face, giddy, light-headed, happy.

I snorted nine bags of heroin in the city.  All of them in bathrooms.  Bathrooms in bars, restaurants, and cafés.  I presented a clean-cut appearance and almost always patronized the business whose bathrooms I used to avoid suspicion.  I carried a cup emblazoned with the place's logo, just to further justify my use of their restroom.

The next time we meet, Tracie asked me if I booted. I said yes, and she offered me a “clean spike.”  I remembered what “boot” means, and told her, actually, no, I don't boot, I snort it.  I tell her that I know it's kind of a waste, but I don't like fucking with needles, even though I know I'm missing out on the “rush” that come with injecting heroin.  A tall black guy walks past us with ear-buds in.  She discreetly pointed at him and whispered “he raped me”.  “He knew I had two warrants out and so I couldn't call the cops.”  “That's fucked up” was all I could think to say.  “My program, if they see me doing any deals or anything, I'm totally fucked.”  She threw the two tiny wax paper bags, into a baseball cap that has suddenly materialized in her hands.  

In the bathroom, I would unzip my backpack and take out a literary journal I purchased before leaving, not realizing that I would be too high to read any of it.  On it, I put a straw cut to about three inches, a folded wax paper bag filled with heroin, and a credit card.  I would empty the tan powder from the wax paper bag, and then rip the bag, getting every little bit of heroin that might have accidentally gotten stuck to the bag.  I would rip the bag a couple of times, crumple it into a ball, and toss it out.  I would take the straw and scrape off any heroin that might have inadvertently gotten stuck on the credit card during while I made the line, putting it back into the line.  I would snort the line.  I would snort the back of the literary journal, just to make sure I got everything.  I would lick my finger and rub it on the back of the journal.  If I saw more than a little bit of powder, I would feel sad for wasting good heroin. I would taste my finger.  It always tasted great.

Before I came to New York, I had scoured the internet in search of Fun Parties and Events and anything that might be interesting.  A Food-Lovers Group was organizing a “guacamole tour” – there were shows and concerts.  I never did anything on the list, my afternoons and evenings all surrendered to a series of heavenly nods.  

The third and final time I saw Tracie, her girl wasn't picking up her phone.  We walked around to kill time, calling often and getting antsy.  We went to a Starbucks, and she ordered one of those giant chocolate and caramel coffee type deals (a milkshake masquerading as a coffee).  She took off the plastic top and stirred it around with her green straw, blending the caramel, chocolate, whipped cream and frozen coffee stuff together into a sloppy mess.  As she did this, I saw how dirty her nails were and felt like cleaning out the gunk under them for her. I think how if people saw her they might be afraid to touch her because she looks homeless and has sores on her face.

On the street, we ran into one of her friends, a handsome boyish looking middle-eastern kid about my age.  He had a Sbarro bag with him, and an open collared shirt exposing abs.  His eyes looked nervous.  He talked about the warrants out for him. He walked like a maniac: long, unpredictable steps.  He said that he could cop for me, but I will have to buy him a bag.  I said OK.  When he’s gone,  I explain to Tracie how I trust her, but now that there are other people involved, I am worried about losing my money.  She said that she trusts this guy like a brother, and that I should not worry.  He loops around a corner.  We follow him, but not too close.   He comes back.  He gave me five unstamped bags, tucked between his thumb and index finger.  He walks away immediately.  I put them in my pocket.  We dart off.  “You owe me two” Tracie said.  I tell her I know.  I counted the five bags and put two in Tracie's outstretched hands.  

We were both pretty happy at this point.  She could tell that I was relieved that it went fine.  She suggested that I come with her to use the men's restroom at the hospital, while she uses the women's.  I declined.  She asked “Am I going to see you again? I figured you got three this time, you know, two for today, one for tomorrow.”   I said probably not, as my bus is scheduled to leave tomorrow.   She gave me a hug, and a little nervous peck on the cheek like a prude school-girl might.  She said “enjoy” and “take care of myself” and I walked away.

Results may vary.,"I find that 24 hours after about 4mg subutex I can feel a bag of heroin fairly well, but I've wasted an extrodinary amount of drugs by not waiting at least that long. Never done methadone since I've had a habit.

 It seems the best way to manage a sub/dope combo habit for me is to take subs in the morning and not re-dose, so you can go through the day, get a nights sleep, and wake up 24 hours later to awesomeness. It seems a nights sleep is also a very powerful tool.

How long do YOU or people you've actually known need to wait? The consensus seems to be 36-48 hours. 48 just seems excessive to me (and unbearable.) 

Just thought this could maybe turn in to a nice little talk. hugs.


*EDIT:* Don't forget to mention your ROAs. I inject my subutex like a moron, so when I do 4mg, I get quite a bit more than someone putting 4mg under their tongue.

I've tried to cop various things (usually weed) all around the US and Europe.  I posted in a thread about a guy who ended up buying dirt which was sold as powder H.  The thread disappeared but there are things to be learned.

If anyone has any other tips, feel free to add this to this thread.

This is the biggest and most important one.  If the guy is worried about you being a cop and acts overly suspicious then he is probably scamming.  You need this to happen a few times to know what I'm talking about.  A real dealer will just size you up and move on.  They might say something once.  A scammer will REPEATEDLY bring it up to make you feel like you need to prove you aren't a cop.  This puts you on the defensive.  You're a lot less likely to spend much time on the handoff or inspect the goods.  This is a HUGE warning sign.

An alternative to this is the ""there are cops around"", said with super anxiety.   ""we need to go back here behind this building...."" or do the handoff super quick.  This robs you of any chance to inspect the goods by throwing you off your game.   Once they get the $ they'll tell you to put away the goods or just take off running.

Another take on this is ""there are cameras watching"" so they don't let you do any inspection.  The handoff is done simultaneously.

A street dealer who has too many goods to sell.  He might say he has coke, but you say you just want weed. Well what'd you know, he can get you all sorts of weed !   In the story posted, the dealer was going around selling *2* kinds of H and 2 kinds of pills.  Street dealers won't be selling 2 types of H.  If you hear shit like this be super suspect.  I once told a guy i wanted weed.. well sit here in this alley and wait he says..  I wasn't too far from a main road of the strip in vegas.  The guy shows up 10 mins later from the back of the alley and has his cohort yelling ""Yo E GIMME MY MONEY"" from the other direction of the alley.  This was meant to make me all scared and do the handoff quick.  Well, i make him put the ""weed"" in my hand and its fucking lettuce wrapped in a cheap sandwich bag.  I throw it down, the guy follows me for blocks, threatening to stab me.  I end up giving him a pull off the bottle I bought to get him to leave him alone.  If I had worked out I would have just beat him down with a few solid punches to his face.  

Anyone else have any clues how to know you're being scammed ?",1337592864.0

My story is quite similar to many of the others I've been reading on here. I'm 27, live in NW area of Ohio, and have experimented with a plethora of different drugs. Out of that said plethora, Opiates became my one and only true love. What all started with a legit prescription for a bad tooth slowly developed into the five year addiction that I am currently battling. 

I really don't have an opiate that prefer. I guess I just prefer whatever I can get my hands on which typically on consists of Percocet, Vicodin, Roxicodone, Tramadol, and Heroin. Here lately it's been all about the H. Throughout this all I've never used the needle. 

Just this month I've decided that I'm done. Well, I want to be done anyway. Three days ago I drove to the closest rehab/detox facility in my area which is about 2 1/2 hours away. I had an assessment and then sat in the midst of withdrawals for over four hours all the while fighting the urge to just leave and go home and get my fix only to be told that they don't take my insurance even though I was told twice over the phone before the actual trip that they did. :/ Now I'm lost. I don't know where to turn next as living where I live my options are VERY limited. So I've decided that I'm going to do this on my own. My bedroom will be my place to detox. I've studied up and read all about different ways to help with the whole process of withdrawals but I still think there just has to be more info out there from people who have actually experienced this. So I'm sorry in advance if this is a kind of repost but I have a few questions : 

1. What should I expect? I've heard that the fear of withdrawal is actually worse than the withdrawal itself. Is there any truth to that? 

2. Any advice from anyone whose been through it in regards to what kinds of medicines would help with this besides Subs or Methadone? 

3. How long does it really typically last? 

4. What should I expect afterwards? I've been hearing a lot about people getting severely depressed etc for months after the withdrawals subside. 

That's about all the questions I have left guys. Any help/advice would be truly appreciated and once I've gone through this myself I have no intention of abandoning this sub as I want to try to help others who are in the same position that I'm in now.

Put me on the methadone... but where?,"I've been using opiates since I was 14 years old, practically daily, with some periods of time where I did not use. The first drug I did was an OC40. I have now turned to using H to support myself affordably. Opiate addiction runs in my family, so do other dopamine related disorders like Parkinson's. I have resigned myself to the fact that I will be a slave to opiates. Even after 8 months of not using I still had terrible diarrhea, depression, and the worst symptom of all: pain and tiredness.


I've tried methadone before, and it was the most stable opiate I have consumed. I didn't have to increase my dose for weeks. All my manic symptoms disappeared entirely, as they normally do on opiates. To me, it is practically a miracle drug, as long as you can have it. The withdrawal is worse than any other opioid. 

My question is, how do I get on methadone? I would really rather getting a prescription. I will go to a clinic if it is necessary.

-1 100mcg/hr Mylan Fentanyl Patch

-Gram of decent MDMA

-Half gram of Ketamine

-2ce, Acid, Piracetam, Pot, a lot of Candy (mainly chocolate and peanut butter based).

However, I just recently I was referred to a pain management clinic to treat the pain more effectively. I cant even explain how nice it is that I don't have to beg for the doctor to prescribe me something that would at the very most just lessen the pain enough for me to get a few hours of sleep. Anyways, my new doctor asked me if I would rather be prescribed oxycotin or Opana. I knew nothing about Opana so I decided I would try it out. I went to 7 different pharmacys trying to fill it and no one carried it. At the end of the day I had to go back and ask him to just perscrib me the oxycotin. Where do most people here that are perscibed strong pain pills get their orders filled? Also I'm looking at the comparison chart that I saw on the side bar and it is saying that oxymorphone (which is pretty much opana, right?) is a 7 while oxycodone is a 1.5-2. Is Oxymorphone really that much stronger, or is that if you only snort or IV it?
Sorry I am such a scrub at all of this higher lever opiates.

I'll be smoking really good marijuana & dosing some MXE as well. 

Tell me, oh fellow opiophiles, what should I do? 

(Despite what anyone says, I will probably end up doing 30mg tonight and 30mg tomorrow, but if someone says something really fucking genius, I'll consider it.) 

edit: Oh, and I've taken 2mg of Klonopin earlier in the day as well. And will be potentiating with hydroxyzine (my new favorite antihistamine)! 

Double edit: Blew both roxies last night and have a big fat nada for today. Possibly some Opana laterz; we'll see. 
EDIT: It was fucking way worth it, I had a fantastic day! I'm nodding and tripping on MXE & weed with klonopins and sexytimes. :D Wowwwwww. ",1337636185.0

I was looking for some advice on my painkiller habit. I would like to continue taking hydrocodone, but I don't want any long term health affects or physical addiction. I am already mentally addicted but I am fine with that because I have very strong willpower and I have a lot of patience. 

So right now my plan is that every Tuesday I am home alone all day with no responsibilities. This is the only day of the week that I let myself do hydrocodone. Right now I am getting it from the pill Norco, and a Tussionex liquid. Generally when I am taking Norco I do a cold water extraction first. When I don't, I don't let my self have more than 2 pills. All together at any one dosing I am having about 30-35 mg of hydrocodone. How much is normal for getting high? Throught the day I might have around 50-60mg of hydrocodone but spread out. With the current plan will I develop a physical addicton? I would be willing to answer any questions! Thank you all very much for answering all of this <3 ",1337735322.0

So even if you never share needles or have a single disease, _please_ take the extra ten seconds to dispose of things properly. I'm NOT suggesting that any of you guys would ever do something this inconsiderate or being like ""Oh, all IV drug users have HIV and Hep-C"" and shit like that, because given the harm reduction tips on here and all the posts I've read, people are really careful and I doubt that any of you do. But just for the sheer freak-out factor of not knowing who's it was, whether they were as careful as you guys or not, please just think of other people and don't be this inconsiderate. And if you're around other people who are less-so, please remind them. Or if you're with other users you don't know too well and stuff is left lying around, it's all too easy to have an accident. Most of the time probably inconsequential, but it only takes one. 

Sorry to post this if it's like off-topic or not the right thing to say, but she just called me sobbing and has to wait like six weeks before she'll know if she got anything from it. And she has shitty insurance, shitty parents, and is just barely getting by on her own, so in the rare case that she _did_ get (god forbid) HIV, it's a fucking terrible situation. And given that it's super unlikely that it was the clinic's fault (I mean, even if they _did_ have used needles there which is unlikely, they'd have to dispose of them properly) but just someone who was coming to the clinic, so it's not like she can get any money from them if she needs treatment. 

I tried to reassure her that the odds are pretty damn low of getting HIV or Hep-C even assuming whoever used it _had_ that, but still, that's little reassurance until you know for sure that you _were_ one of the lucky ones. And it's not a good way to start your summer.

So _please, please, please_ cap them, throw them in one of those plastic red bins designated for that purpose if they're available, and if not, even an empty soda can with the top folded over is better than nothing. Don't put others at risk.

I woke up first at 7:30am, said ""just a little longer,"" woke up at 9am, repeat, woke up at 11am, repeat, just woke up at 1:30pm.  So I slept from 11pm-1:30pm-14.5 hours.  I do this probably 5 times a week.  It's pathetic. 

Does anyone else who has switched to subs find themselves sleeping an exorbitant amount?  I need to get off this ridiculous schedule soon, as I have classes from 8am-noon everyday starting next tuesday.  I'm thinking of getting another stimulant script; as much as I hate the way they make me feel, at least they get me out of bed.",1337882471.0

The past few months i would run out only a little early, but recently i have binged a bit and seem to not care about the consequences untill the instant i swallow the pill.

Just the other day i dosed about 9 pills in 5 or 6 hours and i am finding it hard to stop my self.

Some more extra info, i am a pure bread socially awkwad penguin but when im dosed (even a 5-10mg dose) i become very social, funny, more motivated etc i feel good, and i am happy, which i would say on average i am a 4.7/10 on the happy scale.


My request from you is any advice you gugs might have that would make me realize the bad tbi.gs im doing, which also include taking some of my moms Lt 10mg, ive taken a good bit but i always leave her some, i geel bad, i know she knows but hasnt said anything.

I do not want to slip up again, ive though of giving my script to my parents to handel and give me a few a day, like 3-4 a day depending on pain, but at the same time i have to have will power because im sure i could find them.

How to deal with a friend who is off his rails.,"A good friend of mine introduced me to Heroin. He did so, he now admits, so that I would buy it through him and give him some. He feels terrible about it, or so he says...

His use spiraled out of control after about a year of using.  He started speedballing, boosting all the time, even considered robbing a bank. Luckily, he got caught before that could happen, and is now in jail with 5 separate theft related charges. During his spree to rock bottom, he alienated just about all of his family and friends: He stole thousands from his parents, stole his childhoods best friend's $10,000 watch when said friend let him crash there when he was homeless, he even stole a bottle of valium from me. I am the only person left, in the world, who still communicates with him, aside from his family.  Even they are fed up..they could afford to bond him out (65k), but they feel he needs to learn his lesson.

When he first went to jail, he wrote me, and sounded almost relieved. He said he had ""found god,"" had no desire to use, that jail was the best thing to ever happen to him, etc. I wrote back that I was happy for him.
Next letter, he tells me he is getting panic attacks, and has started taking clonopin. The fact the jail rx'ed him this is testament to his amazing manipulative skills..he was IN jail for being a known drug abuser/seeker.
I knew it was bad news, and wrote back that this worried me, and to be careful.

I just received another letter from him today.  True to form, he tried to manipulate his parents while high on klonopin, claiming he was raped orally by someone who was HIV+, and that the same man was promising to rape him anally. He was hoping to freak his parents out so they'd bail him out.  Parents called his bluff, told the jail about the accusations, the jail investigated it thoroughly, and found out he was lying. He was sentenced to 10 days of isolation. Right before he went in, he told me, he spent all the ciggs etc he had been accruing on 30 blues, and he spent the whole time in isolation high as balls.

Every time he fucks up, I tell him to hang in there, keep trying, and I am there for him.  I am starting to worry he is using me as a crutch, feeling like ""well, I lost everyone else, and I WON'T lose SmackNoob, so fuck it.""
Do I need to show him some tough love, let him know I WON'T be there for him until he gets clean? Or should I keep on being there for him? Whatever I'm doing, it obviously isn't working.

I should point out, to be fair, that he has been a great friend to me during my own trials and tribulations.

As a teen I discovered through much research that I was lied to constantly by society about the effects of drugs.  I took acid very young, and didn't turn into a building jumper.  Smoked pot and still had decent grades, and didn't turn into a pervy child rapist.  Did mushrooms and didn't go crazy.   I finally was prescribed some codeine after my wisdom teeth were pulled, and I found that one feeling that I loved - the opiate love that I still enjoy today.

Fast forward about 5 years and I was introduced to H, and found the pentacle of awesome.  The waking dreams, noddy goodness, and good times.  The only thing I hated about H was getting it and the adventure of getting it. (why couldn't their just be an H seven eleven in my neighborhood)  I quickly learned to shoot myself after someone blew my arm out dosing me.  Where I live there is no tar - just different shades of brown powder usually supplied by the latino community in foil.  I've done wax packs before as well, and onetime almost od'd with 3 other friends doing white.  I stopped half plunge after I heard the other two fall to the floor.  I had to do everything in my power to stay on this side, I grabbed them both put them in the shower till they came back.

This story could go on for ever, I had a good and bad 2 years - learned that you can get snagged by it and getting sick sucks.  I also learned that it's only time before you break the sickness, and the desire never goes away - but the compulsion dies down and you can live a normal life without the need to do a bag to start the day.

I now am fairly successful, have the family the ""normal"" life and do my thing.  I still smoke a little weed, and on the rare occasion crush and snort a 30mg Oxy OR split it do half on Friday and the other half on Saturday.  Either way my tolerance went back down, and I'm good for another month two or three.

Maybe someone will leave some useful advice, maybe someone will be entertained while waiting to pick up, maybe nothing at all. I'm not sure where it's going yet but it's just a short story about change- as it develops in the real world, and if it gains any semblance of a following/interest here, I'll keep you guys posted.

So, to preface, a buddy of mine who lives in a country far, far away has decided to rearrange his life a little bit. Things aren't bad- he's working for a promising start-up and earns a decent wage. He has a sustainable opiate habit. Pharms only, no street shit. He's creative; people are impressed by his work and his projects are moving along. He's got tons of ideas but everything seems to be just on the cusp; there's just not enough money to push forward on the way he wants to (he incorporated a company to protect his creative entity with a solid plan he's spent dozens of hours on). He could cut back on the opi's but at the end of the day, a couple hundred dollars a month won't make a huge difference. Not to mention personally, he'd just rather not. He's comfortable with his decisions, for better or worse.

So he's decided to start selling as a means of raising some additional VC. Not opi's, however, because it would be too easy to fuck up a package and get high on his own supply. Luckily for him, he truly doesn't enjoy any other drug and he's told me that he's tried plenty- shrooms, bud, MDMA, coke, among others. None did it for him. He wants to pick up something with a good customer base, something that doesn't require too much time to package and sort. Maybe some MDMA? Coke is a good one, too... after a couple packages, the money just doubles up. He's hustled before (opi's, actually- before he knew what they were he made about $11,000 in 2 months. Then he tried them. Bye bye money :'( but seriously, some ups/downs/smiles/frowns later, he was determined to find a good balance and he did. You can, too, just understand that there are times you're going to want and hurt, times when you're going to have to do less than you'd like to (ie- have money for 5, but buy 4 and make them last 3 days. It's tough but if you want to, you'll find a way.)

Back to the meat of the story- So, audience participation time. Any suggestions on what this man should hustle? Weed is an easy suggestion because of the legal stuff, it's really a slap on the wrist deal based on amounts, but the good shit STANK. And he wants to avoid detection. If anyone has any friends with good experiences hustling, and sharing a war story or two about their friends' exploits doesn't violate this subreddit's rules, then I'm all ears.

**Just want to NOTE:** This is in no way an attempt to source anything, the person I'm talking about doesn't even live in this country. Or maybe on this planet. I don't even know what drugs are.",1338169713.0

","I'll try to make this short, I'm 18 now and have been clean for 4 months after trying on my own for around a year. I'm going to NA and have been happy this time around in recovery but really want to stay clean and am looking for advice. 

I used heroin (IV) for 3 and a half years and was so desperate for help but had no idea how to get it I ended up at a suboxone clinic and begged them to take me even though I was too young. I've been in that program for year, but the first 3 months was the only time clean I had on them until now. I was using on and off (mostly on, maybe taking breaks with subs) while still getting them until the last 4 months clean now and I refuse to relapse. Looking back on it now I obviously wish I had just gone through withdrawal, but it seemed completely impossible to control myself. I regret it, but I can't go back and I just want to be off of them.

I started at 8mg and decreased down to 4mg then relapsed for a long time, so I went back to 6mg and started from there once I was taking it seriously. Over 4 months I went down to 2mg where I am now.

With any dose above the 2mg now I could not take it for a day or so and not feel any difference, but now I actually take it every day because if not I feel the slight beginnings of the soreness and anxiousness of withdrawal with occasional thoughts/dreams of using resurfacing but I have a handle on them. 

I plan on going to 1mg soon once I feel more comfortable then 0.5mg, then nothing. How should I do this? I can't afford another relapse and lately as my obsession and cravings haven't been coming up as often, I feel so free but still so trapped by being on suboxone.

I ground up my last 10 mg IR opana as well as two 30 mg roxis in about 8 - 10 ml of water. I didn't use it until this morning because I was already high and wouldn't have known what effects were from what. I kind of regret using the roxis, since the rush of doing a line just isn't the same as a nasal spray (although, perhaps if I do several in a row or in a higher dose / ml concoction it will give me a rush) But I think I will definitely use all of my opana this way since it is so shitty taken any other way (save for IV). 

It definitely works, but I used too much saline solution and not enough pills so the effects were subtle from one spray, multiple sprays got me feeling pretty good..

Today I went out and bought a syringe to measure the saline solution and picked up a dozen more 10 mg IR 'panas. Now that I have the syringe, I plan on measuring the amount of saline solution that comes out from a spray. Based on that I will determine the amount of opana and saline solution I will use. 

I have a number of questions though: 

1. [this](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-saline-nasal-spray/ID=prod1607694-product) is the spray I bought. Will this stuff remain bacteria free even after I add the pills? And, will any of the ingredients mess with oxymorphone or oxycodone in any way? 

2. IIRC, a good way to filter your pills is to take out the plunger of a syringe, stick cotton at the bottom, fill the syringe with your water/DOC solution, put the plunger back in and push down collecting the solution that comes out of the tip? 

A. How much of the oxymorphone will I lose from this process?  

B. Will a qtip be good enough to filter out the stuff I don't want? 

C. How long do I have to let the oxymorphone sit in the saline solution for the oxymorphone to completely dissolve in to the liquid, leaving behind the fillers? 

D. How many washes should I do to get all of the oxymorphone? 

E. I've seen figures like 100 mg of oxy dissolves in 1 CC of water, what is that figure for oxymorphone? 

F. I bought some 'antimicrobial' qtips to use as my filter, do you think these will be better to use for our application than regular qtips? (I'm thinking it's better since it will prevent bacteria from entering the equation, but wondering if it would be worse since they probably added some sort of chemical to make it 'antimicrobial') I know that sounds kind of nitpicky but I tend to get paranoid about chemicals being used in ways they weren't intended (except opiates of course ;p ) 

3. How long can my concoction sit for and still be okay to use?

I've never mixed a hypnotic with an opiate and don't even know if they work together.  I don't have much of an opiate tolerance.  Any advice for mixing them?

EDIT: I have five 10mg zolpidem and 34 7.5-500 lortab

EDIT: so I took 30 mg hydrocodone.  About an hour or a little more after that, I was feeling pretty good and decided to add one 10mg zolpidem.  I got really tired really fast, but didn't have too much trouble resisting... I nodded a couple of times, but I was playing video games and found it wasn't too difficult to concentrate.  (I've tried ambien a long time ago but, if I remember correctly, I just fell asleep.)  After a while I didn't feel sleepy so much as I felt a kind of body fatigue, like I was heavier than usual.  When I tried to walk I felt like I was going to fall over.  My field of vision took on a very strange quality that I don't really know how to describe; things I was looking at would seem to jump out at me, but at the same time, not really.  I kept thinking I was seeing something out of the corner of my eye.  I caught myself talking to myself more than once.  I felt pretty good, but that was probably still the hydro.  At one point my fiancee called me, and I started a fight with her for no real reason.  Partway through the conversation, she said I wasn't making any sense and I told her I was drunk.  She bought that, and we made up and said goodnight.  I don't remember anything after that.  I think I just went to bed.

tl;dr  - it was just kind of a weird experience.  Not altogether unenjoyable, although I should've just turned my phone off.  And as pleadthefifth and a few others said, I'm sure the hydros would've been more enjoyable by themselves.  I may try some of the ambien by itself one of the nights, too.",1338326463.0

If I seem relatable, send me some fun messages.
      
 I got into the opiate world in a pretty vanilla manner. Had some awful migraine issues; maxalt and imitrex did little, and minor surgery when I was 18. Got some good ol' oxycodone. I'd never really been into the drug scene, other than smoking marijuana from time to time, which I didn't enjoy much. Pretty much fell in love with the opiate feeling immediately (after some puking, lol). 
     
Now, I'm 23 and about to enter grad school for mathematics (any math enthusiasts?), and my current typical usage is 3ish times/week 30-60mg of those gooey chewy OPs, although the habit has gotten a out of hand a couple of times. Not really sure why I get those instead of IR stuff... an effort to discourage abuse given my history with mental illness, maybe?   
     
 Well, my migraines are much less frequent these days (Shhh I know. I'm a bad man), so the use is recreational and mainly to help me get motivated to do my research. I LOVE doing mathematics while partaking in some tasty opiates. So.. yeah, that's me. I've never shared this with anyone before now. 
     
 Question: I've used fentanyl before, 25mcg, just wearing it, and that was pretty nice. My parents just throw out their unused patches after a while, as if they're not throwing away treasure, and I'm not above sticking my hand in a trashcan. So, I'm wondering how it would be to possibly poke a small hole in one and use a safety pin to apply small amounts of the gel buccally, or even transdermally, just to be cautious. Would that even work? I'm not a big fan of nodding too hard, so I'd be shooting for about the same effect as 60mg of ER oxy.

I also know both are long lasting, but which one do you feel lasts longer.

The only problem I see with this plan of mine is the more negative effects such as horrible withdraws etc when compared to Bupre.

I have some hardware in my body and this humid weather has been kicking my ass.  I've been seeing my doctor every six weeks for about 8 months or so.  The appointments always go the same way.  Doc comes in, shakes my hand, writes me prescriptions for sixty 5/325 Hydrocodones and ninety 600mg ibuprofens, leaves.  The whole appointment takes 4 minutes (I've started timing them) tops.  He also has me excercising more, and seems to be convinced excercise is all I need to shake my pain.

Trouble is it's been humid as fuck these past few weeks where I live and I ate all of my vicodins in the first two weeks (I have to take two or three at a time to even get a little pain relief-sorry liver).  He has my dosage listed as ""one pill every eight hours for severe pain.""  Yeah, right.  

 Even though I have legitimate pain I've had the worst time getting stronger pain relievers from docs.  This guy is the first doctor that has even heard me out.  Being just 25 with chronic pain seems to set off some sort of ""pill fiend"" alarm only doctors can hear. I'm so afraid of him labelling me as a drug seeker if I ask him for anything stronger.  I'm also worried he might cut me off if I tell him I haven't been taking the meds as he prescribed. 

I always hear about kids complaining of vague head/neck/back pains and walking away with percs or even oxys, but I show up with my femur rob/screw x-rays and am often given motrin.  How do you guys do this?  I've got a pretty good relationship with my doctor but I'm terrified of asking him for anything more.

Some people are more active than others, of course, so they give way to more telling information than others. Some people just post short confessions and disappear. Regardless of a post's or reply's length, character, tone, quality or relevance, there's so much that can be observed with a few passes of a careful eye that, upon taking a step back, it's hard to believe that there's a significant measure of distance between any two b/ropiates (collectively referring to males and females alike and opiate users as a whole, but recreational users, specifically). You'd think they grew up together- in the same family, in a small town that shared similar values and/or a small gene pool, or any scenario that would provide for one uncanny, striking similarity among the entirety of it's population.

We are all highly cerebral. We live in our heads. We are textbook over-thinkers. We are hyper-observant.  We feel strongly. There's an incongruence, or some terrible inconsistency,  between what/how we feel/think/see/hear and how everyone else in the world seems to, and no one else seems to get it. Until we discovered opiates, and  suddenly everything seems to work in ways we never could have imagined. The din of everyday life, punctuated by the staccato of check-ups, dental cleanings and schoolwork, occasionally crescendoing the trills and flutters of birthdays and holidays, was now drowned by an orchestra of colors and flavors like never seen before. The touch, the taste, the smell, as foreign became familiar habit became ritual and desire became necessity. Prayer, meditation. Teacher. Mother. Secret lover. Take me, I'm yours.

It's easy to think that. Too easy, in fact. The truth is that what opiates are, is potential- in it's purest form. Some people become incredibly charitable, selfless, helpful, caring, kind individuals on opiates and feel as though they cannot function without. The truth is that the feelings you feel are triggered by the substance but you own the capacity- it lives within you, you are it's master. Is the tail wagging the dog?

The substance can bring out the worst in you, too. Many of us have done the ugliest things to people who have only opened their hearts to us, simply because we could. Some of us never learn. It goes both ways. 

That's the thing about potential- it's theoretical. We own these powers to create and govern the world we live in, and opiates are just another tool to do so. If we use them well, understand them, incorporate the things we learn into our daily live, and we'll find ourselves naturally gravitating away from them- we won't need or want them as much anymore. We created a world where we want and choose to live in, and should something fall out of array we simply mend it. 

We are Gods, each one of us.

**EDIT:**Thanks for the general positive feedback, the critiques and criticisms. I've always fancied myself a wordsmith and one evening while nodding a thought popped into my head, and I could think of no better place for it to hang but on the hallowed halls of r/opiates.

I made a guide where you can purchase all the items you need, you can find that [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ug4or/dillyzilla_micron_harm_reduction_purchase_guide/)

This guide is actually a lot more simple than many people make it out to be. If you're planning on shooting [anything] semi-reguarly, than you should be doing it safely. You can get away with being grimy for a while, but if you'll ask anyone who has done dirty shots for extended periods - you'll find it catches up and you might end up with an abscess or fucked up lungs or ETC

With that said, this guide is mainly aimed at Safe Injection of **Oxy's and Dilaudid**. You shouldn't be injecting anything with APAP in it, so hydrocodone/vicodins and percocets should only be CWE'd (cold water extracted) and taken orally or up the rectum. The new formula of Opana is a real bitch, and even when done right, ends up with some gel/nasty shit, so I'm going to leave that guide to someone else. I'll also include a few comments on injecting H (tar and powder) at the bottom- but keep in mind this guide generally applies to H as well. 

**As stated in the Purchase guide, you'll need the following: 
- Cooker or Spoon
- Terumo 23G 3CC Syringe/Needle
- Your preferred size of Insulin needle for shooting
- Alcohol Swabs / Wipes
- Micron Filter
- Sterile water
- Cotton Balls** You can find these [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ug4or/dillyzilla_micron_harm_reduction_purchase_guide/)

Guide: *Remember, you don't need to heat the pills. And you don't want to (causes some of the binders to bond and just overall a bad idea). Cold/clean sterile water is the best, and cold water also helps separate the opiate from the pill. No flame needed here! As for H, just substitute H for Pills etc when necessary*

*Note*: This guide assumes you're using 1CC of water. You can usually break down ~4 8mg Dilaudids into 1CC, but I'd recommend rolling with 2-3 for maximum efficiency. As for oxys, you can do 3-4 pills before it gets way too gunky. 

**Step 1** : *Break down your pills*
There are a number of ways to do this, but for Dillys or Oxys you're going to want to crush the pill into a fine powder. If you're doing this on a table, take an alcohol wipe and wipe down the area you'll be crushing on. What I like to do, is put the pills inside a folded piece of printer paper. Then take a lighter and slowly break the pills down into smaller pieces. Then hold the edges and smash the lighter back and forth over the smaller objects into dust. You can then flick the paper a bit and have the pill dust slide down the crack of the paper into your cooker or spoon.

**Step 2** : *Mixing your solution*
With your 3CC syringe/needle, extract 1 CC of sterile water and squirt it into your spoon/ladle/cooker. Put the cap back on and use it to mix the powder and water around. Dilaudid will break down very easily, whereas oxy will be a bit more gunky and leave behind a lot more residue. Continue stirring this solution for 1-2 minutes, then we're going to leave it for a few minutes and do step 3 while it's soaking

**Step 3** : *Prep the Micron Filter*
This is a step a lot of guides completely neglect to mention, and it's frustrating as hell if you forget to do it, because you lose so much of your solution. Take the 3CC Syringe/Needle and extract another 1-1.25CC of sterile water. Take off the needle and place the Micron filter on the end. It will slide/fit right on there as it's meant to fit on a luer-lock type of syringe. Slowly push the 1-1.25 CC of water through the filter and let the water just drop out on the carpet or whatever [haha]. Remember to do this slowly and steadily, if you push to hard you can fuck the filter up. A good .50-.75 of water will come out, and the rest is in there soaking the filter. [It's better for this to moisten the filter up than your precious drug, eh?]

**Step 4** : *Pre-Filter with Cotton*
Now go back to your solution that's been sitting for a minute or so, and begin stirring for another minute or two. You can cut corners and speed it up (I do all the time), but generally it's agreed the longer you let it soak, the more drug gets into the water. Anyway, take a SMALL piece of cotton (the size of a tic-tac or pea) and throw it into the solution. Take your 3CC and place the tip of the needle 'securely' into the middle of the cotton. Then SLOWLY pull the plunger up and extract all the water. After you suck up the first run, flick the needle to get air up, and do another extract out of the cotton ball. Bam, you now have your solution inside the 3CC syringe. Inside your spoon or cooker, you will have some gunk/residue, especially with oxys. You can choose to lick this up or whatever/save it for a rainy WD day etc. 

**Step 4** : *Prepping your shot*
Now take needle off the 3CC syringe and replace it with the Micron filter. Grab your insulin needle and take out the plunger and place it someplace 'clean' (preferably on your sterilized desk). Push the solution SLOWLY through the micron filter and backload it into the insulin needle. Do it at a slight angle so the drops that come out of the micron slide down the side of the insulin needle and so you don't get a bunch of air bubbles. Once done, take the plunger for the insulin needle and put it just barely inside the insulin syringe. Flick the bottom so the air comes up to the top, at that point you can remove the orange top and push out the air [and likely .005 CC of solution] out. At this point you have your insulin syringe ready to go for injection.

**Step 5** : *Shoot that shit!* 
Put the syringe down and swing your arms around a few times. Clench your firsts. Flex your biceps. Just move a bit. Then take an alcohol wipe and wipe down the area you're gonna be shooting. I'd recommend the area in the crutch of the elbows because they are huge and easy to see. Bring the needle into your arm at a 35 degree angle or so. As soon as you think you're in a vein, pull back on the plunger very lightly to check if you're in. If so, you'll see blood enter the syringe, and you're good to go and shoot. If not, then DONT pull the syringe out and poke yourself again, simply pull it back slightly, re-AIM the syringe, and try again. If you're not finding the vein at all, try the other arm and try different angles. In the morning or in the cold it's always a BITCH to find a vein, so if that's your situation, take a nice HOT shower and then try again.

**Heroin**
- With tar, you may have to use a lighter or flame to break down the tar a bit. If so, don't wait for it to boil, just put it under and 5cm away from the bottom of the spoon, and just get it hot. Then try stirring again.
- With tar, using a micron filter is definitely do-able, but it'll fill up and block the filter quicker than other forms. A lot of people don't use microns for tar, but if you have them and want to be extra safe, you probably should prevent a bunch of gunk from getting inside you. 
- With china/powder, it will break down and dissolve in your water solution [and should] without any flame/lighter. You can choose to micron filter after cotton filtering, but many people don't.

• how long does it take to grow from seed to useable pods?
• once they flower how long are the pods good for?
• it's winter in my area at the moment (temperature range from 3°C-24°C), what's the optimal growing temps?
• would I be better off growing them in a greenhouse or in a garden bed? Or something else altogether?
• assuming I'm only growing them because I think they are pretty is there a limit on how many I can grow?
• I have dogs, if the dumb one was to eat the flowers and/or pods, would she be ok? I can build a fence no problems but I don't want to honestly. 
• anything else I should know?

As some of you know, I'm on probation because I was a little naughty... So I can't do anything else naughty (I'm too small and cute to go to prison, I'd be snapped up by someone on my first day)

Possible discovery?","Alright I know what your thinking ""fuck not another Tramadol question"" but I've made an interesting discovery so I will try and explain it. Any advice or input is welcome.

So I'll start off by saying that tramadol does absolutely nothing for me as I have a high tolerance. But last night I rolled pretty hard after not taking ecstasy in over a month. This morning I was really sore and could barely walk, (I have hip dysplasia pretty badly, my right leg is literally a couple inches longer than my left leg) so I kindly asked a friend if they had anything because I was out and they only had tramadol... But I decided to give it a go, I took 6 50mg pills and about half an hour later I start feeling it. I was shocked,surprised, curious and giddy all at the same time. It feels as if I took a few Norcos. 

So basically I want to know if anyone has experienced anything similar? or may have an explanation? Does it have anything to do with the ecstasy I took? Or just a coincidence? 

TL;DR: I have a high tolerance to opiates but I took tramadol this afternoon after rolling the previous night and it feels as if I took a few Norcos.",1338932381.0

Problem is, my boyfriend used to be a heroin addict (clean for 6 years), but due to the stress of our cat passing I don't feel comfortable leaving them in the house. He's talked to me about how he's been having urges to use again to deal with the stress/pain so I figured better to get them out of the house. I just have no idea how to dispose of the needles, including the used ones we have at home. 
Should I take the unused ones back to Walgreens (cat had a prescription for them)? Where do I take the used ones? 
Another option would be in the interest of harm reduction giving them to someone who doesn't have access to clean needles. I would be down for that too.

My wife has been taken 325/10 Vicodin for years for chronic lower back pain.  She swallowed one pill.  Then we shared another one by crushing it up and snorting half each.

After 5 hours we each snorted another half pill.  We stayed up another 7 hours before going to bed.  My wife only felt slightly lit.  I on the other hand felt great.  Slept around 8 hours and woke up lit up.  Didn't come down for something like another 6 hours.  

Crashing didn't feel so great but it wasn't horrible.

Next time around we're both going to just swallow the pills.  We were really careful to go really slow taking doses as there is no way to know either of our's tolerance.  If we had taken more we were scarred I would overdose too easily.

During the surgery I was given an IV morphine drip for two weeks. It went fine, although by the time I left the hospital I was craving it constantly. I had another surgery half a year later, and was given a morphine IV drip again. This time I had a pretty horrific reaction - I was covered in hives and my heart rate skyrocketed.

I believe part of this was the allergic reaction, and part of it was a full-blown panic attack. Reading the pubmed on Anaphylaxis seems to match up with their description of what can happen with morphine (although it wasn't my first time). - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001847/

They tried me on demerol and I don't recall having a reaction like that, but I'm told that I reacted negatively to it. For the morphine, I was told that it ""was not a true allergic reaction, but mast cell degranulation"".
Since then I have avoided opiates entirely. 

I had another surgery last summer where, when I was unconscious, the doctor gave me Fentanyl, even knowing my history with morphine and demerol. AFAIK, I did not have any sort of negative reaction to Fentanyl. I've also taken Kratom without a reaction, although I realize that Kratom is quite different chemically even though it works on similar pathways.

My question here is, at some point I will have to have my wisdom teeth out, and I am quite a bit old for it at this point. I want to know if it'd be possible for me to take percocet/vicodin/oxycodone/etc. in combination with my wisdom teeth. My insurance doesn't seem to look positively on the idea of pay for me to be tested for allergens against all of these drugs.

Would it be a terrible idea to take a miniscule amount of, say, vicodin, with benadryl handy and see if there's a response? Perhaps starting on the skin, then 1/100th of a dose orally, then 1/10th, etc, to see if there's a reaction? Or is this a terrible idea?

Anyway, sorry this was long but I'm definitely looking for feedback as to the proper way to go. I don't want to put my life at risk, but I also don't like the idea of having my wisdom teeth out with nothing but benzocaine and tylenol.

Of course dope is cheaper, I have a decent tolerance of about 35mg of oxy and roughly 6-7mg dilaudid inulflated to get high. So it's obviously a pricey habit when I'm getting high 3or 4 times a day and even more times on the dillies. 

However, will dope make me look sickly? Is it easier to OD? 
I look pretty healthy besides being thin and I won't be shooting (if that even matters), I just don't want to look gross all the time. The two dope users I know always look like shit, but that could just be because they don't take care of themselves.

Reasons why I may not fail:

* I might not be drug tested
* It will have been 2.5 days since I took them (snorted, if that matters at all) which might be long enough for that amount
* Hydromorphone MIGHT not come up on the test for opiates, since it's synthetic, and oxy/hydro are the primary forms consumed? (total speculation here)
* I've been taking Niacin a few times a day since, which does help with purging weed out of your system, but not sure if it affects opiates

Let me give you guys some back story. I've been on and off heroin since 2007. I liked to refer To my self as a ""functioning addict"" I hid it well from every one I knew. 

Anyways fast forward to this December I start using again after a very long hiatus (I occasionally used codones during said hiatus) but this was my first time nodding in a long time and I was hooked again. Now normally when this happens I go stay with someone close to me and buy up a lot of dones and have said person distribute them to me so I can try and ween off. 

How ever this time I needed to get clean fast because it was my cousins wedding coming up (more like brother) in early may and I had best man duties to fulfill and I did not want to be high during this time. So I went to a clinic in Dallas that gave me suboxone. It worked great. I ended up using it for about a month. 

My question is why did I feel fine for around three days after my last suboxone, but on the 4th day I started having these weak withdrawals. Really the only symptoms were diareah and my legs would get really restless at nights along with the tingling in my arms. This shit has literally lasted 11 days now. I can't even remember the last time I haven't pissed hot shit out of my ass or gotten a decent night sleep.

I just discovered this sub-reddit, and was reading through post about how you strategize to deceive us.

**#1** personally I don't care what you do as long as you don't hurt others. **I strongly believe the government has no right to litigate what substances we put in our bodies....** That being said I find you ""seekers"" extremely annoying.

I hate being lied to. If you sign in with the sole purpose of seeking drugs you are wasting my time. I wouldn't mind that alone, but you guys clog up the department and people who are legitimately ill suffer as a result of your selfish attempt to deceive us to get what you want. I have a problem with this.
**We can see right through all of your stories**. I've heard em all too. I deal with *seekers* all day long every day. It takes me about 30 seconds to know when someone is drug seeking. 

Protip: look respectable, don't show up looking scummy and smelly. Take a shower, and try to look like a normal member of society.
This is the biggest thing you could do to help your odds of getting 
what you are wanting. It really wont help most of you. It takes the most ingenious and creative story to pull a fast one on us. Happens very rarely but it happens. The ""I lost it"", or ""My script got stolen"" BS dont fly. 


**We now use a national system** 
I type in your name and date of birth and I can instantly see that your getting Norco from the dentist , or from a doctor in another town. **I know how much you got, when you got it, and where you filled it.** Soon all ED's, clinics, and primary care Doc's will be using this system and the days of a creative story getting you drugs will be over.



So there you have it, if anything this is insight and perspective you probably wont get anywhere else. Down vote me to hell Ive been nothing but honest with you.
Oh...One last thing, and if I show up on the ambulance to one of you unresponsive from OD'ing I will pump your ass full of so much narcan you will be sober for the next month. Lets not meet this way.

My retarded mistake today was using a day old Micron filter... thought it was cool, but likely not.

I was pretty high after shooting some opana and then tar, and then out of nowhere, about 30 minutes in, I got a massive 'chill' w/ goosebumps. After that point, I've progressively gotten shittier feeling, fever, cold sweats, aches/paints/joint pains, malaise, a bit confused (couldn't remember what a thermometer was called) and massive headache, loss of appetite. 

What do you think? Was gonna hit the ER but want to avoid that if possible. I don't seem to be getting worse, and in fact, I feel a little bit better right now than 20 minutes ago. I've been smoking tar to help w/ the pain [i know, prob a dumb idea]

Anyway, I also got bit by two ticks recently, one of which had the 'lyme disease' bullet pattern around it, but it wasn't bright red, it was more bruise. The doc concluded that it couldn't have given me lyme because it wasn't attached for 48+ hours. I've been having the joint pains for a few days now and thought about going to the Doc again regarding lyme disease [the first bite was about 4 weeks ago] and i've had a pretty nasty wound from the second bite for a bit now.

So my paycheck had just gone through, and my normal oxy guy was dry (and uncertain when he may be good again). Luckily a friend of mine had someone else i could call, however they too had just ran dry of 30s, but informed me they did have some xans i could grab. I figured they were better than nothing, and so i headed on over. Then, upon my arrival, the girl (who i was meeting for the first time and also ended up being quite cute, which just adds to overall awesomeness of scenario) tells me while shes all out of oxy, she can get some H right now, or pretty much any time i need it!  
And so now here i am, just 24 hours after i was unsure of any source to grab my overpriced oxy, and ive got 3 stamp bags left (had 4 but 1 was for tonight :D) as well as a nice couple of xanax blues, and a new, reliable, cutie drug dealer with good prices for dope.  Life is good :D

Taking one 8mg/2mg SL strip and cutting it up in to little pieces, lasting 5-7 days. The person thought they only had one strip left. But since opening up to me about it they went around the room to see if they had any more because they tend to hide stuff and now found 2 others. Which are now in my possession and control.
This person **WANTS** to get off and I believe thats half the battle right there.


It just worries me that they now know there are more. Before they thought this was the last strip so they now have the idea(I would think) if the WD are too great they still have a way out. Just the idea of a way to stop the WD pain I think its going to be that much harder knowing that that there is still a crutch.


I would like to know what did you guys do during your withdraws? What was your approach? Did you take any meds to help the WD symptoms? How long were your WDs. How long did it take you to feel ""normal""? Do you still feel normal? What about eating. Im thinking soup and crackers. Since eating is an issue.


**Tell me anything and everything, please.**


Maybe you know of a website, contacts, ect...because even talking to the pharmacists I cant get, or they jsut dont know, information about it. I hear on forums how Dr. say once they taper off they wont have WD. Which by the look of it on these forums is complete BS.


When doing some research and laid out a plan for my friend to help get though this.


Anything and everything you can think of telling me, please do. 


I understand its going to be hell for 1, 2 or more weeks. Given it can stay in your system for months.


If you're curious about my plan here is a rough draft. Please feel free to add any input.


Thanks.


*Multi-vitamins, liver support, exercise, aminos(brewers yeast) clonidine, nurontin, restoril, diaspam, kratom(I found this herb and read it can be used for opiate and meth WDs) and some Clonidine*


...and these are some encouraging words I have for this person.


*It does end and you will feel normal again. just keep reminding myself that I am healing.It hurts to heal. I am healing.*

*God is BIGGER than this and will get you through this.* 

*Life is too precious to be on this drug.*

For me, my heroin use began as a form of self-medication to free me of social phobias, depression and anxiety but went on to be much more recreational when I started shooting speedballs. Even so, I know I got addicted to opiates because they took away pain rather than just for the high of it.
 
Years later, when I tried to get my life together I was able to quit cocaine very quickly because it was primarily recreational and I didn't need it, but I still felt that I needed heroin and continued using it for quite a few years before I was able to quit.

Now I read about people getting addicted to pharmaceutical opiates - few, if any, of which can produce a spectacular high like heroin and cocaine. People post pics of pills to show what great stuff they got. This is confusing.

Are people really happy with the kind of high they get from pills or are they using pills first and foremost to relieve psychic pain?",1339946386.0

I guess I'm looking for experience more than dosage guidelines since both the purity of heroin and morphine content of pods/seeds is so variable. But I'm thinking I'd ask anyways: a quarter of a point of ECP (east coast powder) e.g. .025 grams ROI: nasal should be less than nod territory for someone very accustomed to ~50-100 mg of morphine ? 

Edit: Ended up taking a half of a 1/4 of one point (e.g. ~0.0125) an hour ago and I can't imagine what a comparable dose of pods would be. (20 Jumbos per point?)

I'm currently prescribed suboxone and wellbutrin for maintenance and depression, respectively.  I've read many anecdotal reports of suboxone patients getting high from a combination of suboxone and tramadol, even if tramadol never affected them in a positive way before they started suboxone maintenance.  One user even reported that this combination of drugs kept her from using heroin again, whereas suboxone alone could not.  I was wondering if anyone here has experienced this combination?  If so, could you write a detailed report of your experience?  Personally, I enjoyed tramadol before I was prescribed suboxone.  Once my husband was jumped and attacked by an old adversary who, in so doing, fractured my husband's kneecap; the ER doctor prescribed him tramadol, because the hospital had recently come under fire for prescribing an excess of narcotics.  We assumed that the medicine was useless, until one night we were withdrawaling from heroin, and we injested about 400-500 mg each, which curbed our withdrawals and even afforded us a mild, pleasant, and stimulating high.  Now, I'm interested in combining tramadol with suboxone--I've found a website which sells tramadol (and ships it overnight).  I know that I will have to take a break from my daily wellbutrin dose, because it also lowers the seizure threshold and the combining it with tramadol would be too risky.  Other than that, I just want to hear more experiences before I fork out $100+ dollars for tramadol (lame I know, haha).  If it's worthless and overhyped, I don't want to bother.

SSRI SNRI etc...,"Ill explain why im conducting this in a day or two after I have enough responses.

(edit) this seems to be going well and im happy that people are even saying the drug there taking.
one other question id like to ask all of you is how would you say it effects your opiate tolerance if at all and have you noticed any difference since starting the drug if you have been using opis before the treatment.
and thank you so much for participating in my first post!!!

(edit 2) you have all been very helpful in this and very open about it I as well as you know its hard to talk about these things with people who dont really understand them and for that i thank you all. Now the reason I was asking this is because Ive been doing some research into dumping all the SNRI im currently taking and yes ive had wellbutrin before it killed my opiate uptake almost completely btw but the reason for all of this is these antidepressants that all of the doctors have been prescribing us for depression are all cyp450 inhibiters, which means that they will reduce the effectiveness of any opiate that you take depending on the dose of antidepressant to opiate ratio currently mine is way too high for my liking. 60mg cymbalta and 15mg oxy x3 a day which does shit all for me. I suffer from some pretty severe neck and back trauma from a car accident 3 years ago and have been trying to get some PM for a while. Long story short ive decided to ditch the SNRI for st johns wart. now i know i have to completely get off the SNRI before starting that so dont worry im not a nob. But what i would like to do is document my success with this approach along the way with you guys and see if this might help any one else out there and if not it was a fun opi experiment anyways. Im not sure how you can keep track of this but i think that ill do is make a new submission for that project. and please feel free to PM me on a last note i discovered this completely by accident when i took a shitload of zops and downed a bottle of dxm and normally zops dont knock me out but man i was out cold for a good 8 hours or so with my headphones still blasting music sitting upright and i was not even close to being tired at that point.
As for the TL:DR am stopping SNRI to sub st johns wart for its opiate inducing effects due to antidepressants being cyp450 inhibitors. sry for the rambling lol

(edit 4) I should have also mentioned that im interested in the bio activation of opioids and other substances by the enzyme CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 which is part of the CYP450 system. Im trying to see if by stopping the use of the antidepressants and using st. johns wart instead i can induce that particular enzyme and get a greater reaction with less of the drug.

I've been on about .5mg-1.5mg, usually .5mg, of sub for 4 months.
Before that, I would go through a couple of buns in 2 or 3 days, then take a couple of weeks off. I could also catch a buzz off of about 30mg of hydrocodone.

I got a script for hydrocodone today, and last took sub about 72 hours prior to my first dose.  I took 30 mg, and barely felt buzzed. I ended up taking 15 more mg in about an hour, and felt a nice warmth..but in the past, 45mg would have me in a near-nod state.

I'm wondering if sub is THAT strong that it upped my tolerance significantly , or if remnants of sub clinging to my receptors are inhibiting my high.

Any input is appreciated. Thanks",1340080082.0

I have a fairly nice doc, and he has given me vicoprofen a few times for fairly legitimate pain-I.E. I could live without the pills, but they sure do help!
 The first time he gave it to me, he wrote it for 50 with 5 refills. I called 6 months later, and asked for another script, and this time he didn't include any refills. I feel like it was kind of a message-
""This isn't meant to be a once a month deal.""

So, I've been really good lately, but I'd like a little break. I was thinking of calling him again and asking for another fill. It's been 6 months since I got a script for 50, no refills.

If it matters-the last time and likely this time, I won't be talking to the doc himself, just leaving a message with the receptionist asking for a fill.

So, as far as I can tell, it's the kind of thing where it doesn't hurt to try-if he says no, he says no, but it won't get me in any trouble, etc.

Personally, my habit is somewhat of a secret and I like to keep it that way. There are only one or two people that know what I get into and they don't live near me so 99.9% of the time I get high alone. One time, a few weeks back, I had a friend over that was picking up and she came in and asked if she could get high before driving an hour home. I watched super closely as she got everything prepped and got high and I was just so intrigued because although we use the same drug in the same way, her ritual was just so much more different than mine and I'm assuming that goes for the rest of us! I'll start:

My DOC for 3 years was the 10/325 Norcos until 2 years ago when I made the switch to 30mg roxy's. After picking up, I'll usually pull over and park somewhere to get high before I get home. I find myself a hard surface, put one or two blues under a bill and use my Bic lighter to crush them up. Some people are absolutely repulsed by the idea of using money for this but I've never really had an issue with it and I've never contracted anything from it so it's my preferred method, not to mention I'll always have at least one bill on me and it's not sketchy to carry around like straws or foil. Then, I'll use my drivers license to crush up more and cut up lines, switch back to the rolled up bill and BLAMMO! I sniff it all right up. 

I've heard good things about going the IV route but I had a few bad experiences with needles many years ago and haven't wanted to re-visit that just yet. I also know a few people that smoke it but I've heard that it hurts more coming down and you end up wasting a lot of the pill. And no matter how rad people say plugging is, I don't think I'll ever try it but to each his own!

What about the rest of you super awesome new opiate friends? Entertain us with your mega rad rituals, methods and of course, your favorite poison!

He had only picked up from this guy once before but the guy said if we get 30 then the price drops to 20 each so we each were going to pick up 15.  So its about 1 oclock in the morning guy pulls up next to us gives us the pills we give him the money the whole transaction takes about 20 seconds.  I take a quick look at the pills they were already split into two bags of 15 cause we asked him to do that.  I dropped my friend off and headed home.  The next morning I look at them more closesly and they look so similar to the A 215 but they just seem a little different for some reason.  They were so similar that literally only someone who uses a decent amount would be able to tell they were off.  I just thought oh well must just be a new batch from the company.  So at about 9 in the morning at work the curiosity takes over me and I need to take one. 

So I take one as im feeling depressed at work the morning sucked usually ill take 3/5 days per week at work just to get through the day. 

Around 10:30 I start feeling a little strange like dizzy i at first thought i needed water because it was so hot.  Then I started to take notes because for my job I needed to make a form and then once it was filled out would automatically send to my boss and i didn't know the html for that so I was looking it up.  After about half a page of notes i looked back at what i had wrote and i realized it was not english and i had never written like that before it was like a really strange script. 

Then i new something was off so i walk into the bathroom to put water on my face to try to pull myself together and then i realize i had been staring at myself in the mirror for 10 mins from what seemed like another part of the bathroom.  Almost like an out of body experience.  Thats when i put everything together and realized i was either rolling or on K at work.  Fuck fake pills 

I've never done K before, but it kinda felt close to molly / x but not exactly the same so maybe it was a strange batch or it was K.  So guys make sure to be careful if the pills look off.  It was a A 215 and the only difference i can see is that A is a little bit bigger then normal besides that it looks so similar its crazy,  but anyone who uses will be able to tell the difference im sure.  

Has anyone else heard of this happening?

One passes his 24 months in eternity. All the years of the beefeater are lived only in time. 

-Aldous Huxley

>Heroin stimulates the imagination marvellously. It kills all pain and worry like a charm. But at the very moment when you have the most gorgeous ideas, when you build golden palaces of what you are going to do, you have a feeling at the same time that nothing is really worth doing, and that itself gives you a feeling of terrific superiority to everything else in the world.
________________________________
>Of course, if you count time by years, you're very likely right. But what have the calculations of astronomers to do with the life of the soul? Before I started heroin, year followed year, and nothing worth while happened. It was like a child scribbling in a ledger. Now that I've got into the heroin life, a minute or an hour - I don't know which and I don't care - contains more real life than any five years' period in my unregenerate days. You talk of death. Why shouldn't you? It's perfectly all right for you. You animals have got to die, and you know it. But I am very far from sure that I shall ever die ; and I'm as indifferent to the idea as I am to any other of your monkey ideas.

Well, I've googled every guide i could find, however, I cant seem to catch a buzz from plugging but, I can just swallow them and feel great. So how do you do it? Can I actually have some weird tolerance to plugging medicine. I've tried to even plug Ecstasy with the same results, and I've had friends tell me they have just pushed the damn pill in there without dissolving it in water, which I think is absurd.

Here is my steps, tell me what I'm doing wrong. 

1. Crush up 3 percocet 10mg, total of 30mg
2. Dump the powder in about 2-3oz of warm water, cap the cup and shake like a mofo for a couple minutes. 
3. Lube up my oral syringe with mineral oil. 
4. I lay on my right side and insert the syringe as far as I can. I may have to do it 2-3 times till all the solution is gone. 
5. Continue to lay for at least 15 minutes in hopes that the solution will get absorbed. I've tried the right side, left side, laying on my back.

Am I sticking to far? Should I be squirting the solution in my rectum, or be pushing it all the way in so it get's absorbed in my colon? How much water do you guys use?

I've done this numerous times in order to hopefully get it right, but I'm just wasting my meds. Its not tolerance issue cause if I swallow them I still get all nice and fuzzy. But then I dont want to take anymore cause even if my body is absorbing the percocets, I dont wanna OD on tylenol. (After years of enjoying them recreationally, I've learned not to go off the deep end, I dont ever want to go down that road again, but its not worth the god damn withdrawals. I'm manic depressive and they give me energy and motivation along with my antidepressants. However, LPT i've learned is the antidepressants help me keep from going off the deep end, so if you guys cant control your intake, try them out, it gives me the willpower to keep enjoying them recreationally. My doc gives me doxipene which is trycyclic and different than prozac and all the main ones.)

So i said fuck dealing with this people and left for a new job. Two of my bosses who I thought were friends on a personal level went off on me when i quit, and they fired my brother who worked as a busboy there just for being my brother! He didnt have anything to do with it.

I've been on Suboxone for a little over 3 years now. I started with 8mg 2x  per day in the beginning and I tapered down to .75 mg over 3 years.

I've been wanting to get off Suboxone for a while now but haven't been able due to having surgeries. Dr. just upped my suboxone instead of having to take narcotic pain relievers.

The farthest i've made it from Suboxone withdrawal is 5 days and it was so hellaciously bad going from .75 to 0 that I couldn't do it.

I'm going to start working again in a month and decided now it would be best to kick it without having to work.

This is probably the 40-50th time I have concoted something to help with withdrawal, back from the times I was using included.

I have found taking these to be AMAZING at helping with Suboxone withdrawal and just wanted to help if someone was out there and felt they couldn't do it. The withdrawal from Suboxone is so painfully long, it doesn't seem to peak until about 5-7 days.


I've made it 8 days now with the following concoction, I do experience some mild chills, soreness, and occasional diarrhea but it's NOTHING compared to what it could be.



All of this can be purchased over the counter, I can get Mobic from my Dr. without having an office visit. It's $10 for 90 pills.



Wake up in the morning take,

2 x Glucosamine Chondroitin
1 x 81mg baby aspirin
1 x Vitamin D
2 x Multi Vitamin
2 x 7.5mg Mobic (Meloxicam)
2 x Hyland's restless leg sublingually
(www.restfullegs.com)
1 x 5mg amlodipine (blood pressure) (optional and requires prescription)

Repeat Hylands Restless Leg  sublingually every 4 hours x2 pills


Night time before bed, this combo should knock you out and keep you asleep. Also alleviates anxiety.

1 x [GABA](http://www.vitaminshoppe.com/store/en/browse/sku_detail.jsp?id=VS-2217)

1 x [5HTP]

1 x [LTyrosine](http://www.vitaminshoppe.com/store/en/browse/sku_detail.jsp?id=VS-1383)

I'm drinking 88oz of purified water per day as well and forcing myself to eat 3 x @ 700 cals.

I'm posting this because I know it will help someone out there that can't kick the sub w/d. If anyone has any questions please post them here or pm this account.

If I had to put it on a timeline, it would be approximately:

T-15: Took 25mg of Diphenhydramine(bennadryl)

T: blew .2g of diesel

T+15: no nod yet, blew one more bag and swallowed 10mg of oxycodone/1000mg of APAP.

T+30: Start to feel a puke building up, just make it to the bathroom in time to lose 16 oz of pumpkin spice coffee and an everything bagel.

It's been 15 minutes since I booted, and I feel not very high at all.
Did I just lose all that opiate goodness down the toilet?
Just curious how fast absorption occurs, how much H I was likely to have swalloed due to drip, if I definitely lost the percs.

You guys seem to think I'm driving around at night in Harlem randomly calling out to black people for drugs.

I'm not.

I've tried going to the ""bad parts of town"" of some pretty well off towns here in CT, areas that are known as ""drug zones,"" during the day.  I'll park a bit out of the way and watch until I see someone clearly stop by a corner, say something to the people there, and then see money handed out the window in exchange for what is almost assuredly drugs. After they leave, I drive by, roll down my window, and ask in a calm manor, ""Do you guys have any boy?"" I've done this about 15 times, 5 times the people claimed they're not selling any drugs, 10 times I've been offered various other drugs BESIDES heroin-crack, pcp, ""wet"" weed. Everyone claims there is no heroin to be had. But then I'll read in the newspaper that so and so was busted in the same town with a kilo of raw...so obviously, there is some heroin.

Also, people who want to belittle me-I'm sorry I'm a beginner at this, and don't know what I'm doing. Instead of hurling insults at me, it would be nice if you could offer some advice on how to change up my approach. Look at all the time I took to give advice to [CharlemagneCornelius](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/vhsja/60mg_oxycontin_on_a_airplane_reddit/) on how to be safe carrying pills onto a plane. That is something I have a LOT of experience with, so I can offer him some advice. You don't see me telling him ""LOL dude what an idiot, you clearly have no friends and have the IQ of a watermelon, you're going to end up in jail getting violated by nasty nate.""  Cuz that would be a dick move. Instead, I use my experience in the matter (I've flown over 100 times, and have often had a few things with me that I technically shouldn't have had) to help him avoid any trouble if he chooses to bring narcotics on a plane with him. He's going to do it either way, so the key is HARM REDUCTION-try to minimize any chance he has at getting snagged.

TL;DNR specifically for the edit: If you have advice, great; if not, don't be a dick. Thanks

___________________________End Rant____________________________________


So, first off, mods, this is NOT sourcing. I am looking for someone to ride along with me to NYC or some other hot spot in the NY/NJ/CT area to try and find a number.  If that is against the rules, please delete this post, and accept my apologies in advance. Mods, I realize you moderate with a firm but fair temperance.

About me: I'm a relatively mature (obv. not totally on top of my shit or I wouldn't be HERE, eh?), easy going guy in my late 20's. I'm cursed by my whiteness when it comes to picking up connects. Whenever I drive around areas known to be hot spots, when I roll down my window and shout to the corner boys if they have any boy, I get a ""who, me?"" look, and they say they don't know what I'm talking about. I'm pretty sure I don't look like a cop, but I guess I might? 

So, I'd like to find a using friend (all of my friends would never touch H, as far as I know-and they don't know I use, either) who has some street smarts, and is also in need of a better connect. I have one now, but it's shit dope (hartford). I want to find that FIRE. I'm not a daily user-can't afford it. But I would LOVE to have a safe number to call to get some great fire in the NYC area.

I think it would be safer, and easier, if we drove around as a pair. Less chance of getting ripped off or in a dicey situation, and two sets of eyes to look out for trouble.

I'd like to find a connect in a place OTHER than 
a) the dirty 3 in Jersey-Patterson, Newark, and JC. Why? Because as a white person with CT plates, I am bound to get arrested sooner rather than later driving in and out of these cities with any regularity.
b) any number where the connect requires you to meet inside of project housing. Again, I just clearly don't fit in there, and I will doubtless be targeted either for arrest or for a good ole fashion mugging in no time.

Why do this? To avoid getting middlemanned. So many people in my situation just accept whatever shitty deal they get from someone who has a connect. Sure, I'll pay $100 for 5 bags, when I know you got the whole bundle for $60 and pinched half of each of my bags. Nope. Not gonna happen anymore. Let's take the power back, people.

PM me if you're within a 45 minute drive of Rye, NY in any direction and interested in this mission.  I'll drive to you on our first meet up. ",1340481342.0

It was/is miserable as fuck, but certainly not full-on wd bad.  My formula this time around:

First 12 hours: Aleve
12-36:  Aleve, ibuprofen, Imodium, hyland's restless leg (got that from another poster on here).  Plenty of fluids and food.  Moderate amount of alcohol.  1 soma that didn't do shit as far as I can tell.  A little weed.
36-72:   

Continued daily multivitamin, hyland's restless leg, Imodium, Aleve and ibuprofen throughout.

Right at the 36 hr mark(8p)  took 2mg alazopram and smoked a bowl.  In next 3 hours took:  30 mg temezapam, 1 mg clonazepam  until I passed out.

Woke up and took 2mg alazopram and my daily multivitamin. An hour later took 60 mg temezapam.  Apparantly around 10:30a I smoked a bowl and my log goes blank from there till 3:45p.. No idea what I was doing.  Playing skyrim and sleeping I think.   Had a glass of champagne at 3:45, then from 5p-11p:  1mg alazopram, .5 mg clonazepam, 60 mg tem, 1 bowl, .5 clonazepam, 1x melatonin cap and .5 clonazepam until I passed out at about 11:15.

My biggest concern at this point is rebound as the benzos wear off --  going to taper down with clonazepam if necessary.  Benzo withdrawal was the worst drug experience of my life's think, fuck doing that again (although that's what I said the other times too lol).

Anyway I'm off too work now. I know none of this means much to anyone other than me, but I felt like I has to brag/celebrate somewhere, and there's not really any outlet for that in my real life.

I've never tried it so I obviously don't know what it's like, but from assumption based on its IV effects (which are quite powerful) I figured that orally it might not be so bad as well. Is this not the case?

Eventually, I was changed to 120 blues (4xD), but he went over my options, saying ""well, we could go with fentanyl patches + roxicodone, or try you on dilauded or oxymorphine. Do you want to stick to the oxycodone, or perhaps go a different route?""

My mind was having a huge orgasm, but I managed to utter to stick to the oxy because I knew they worked before. Well, jump ahead ~2 months to now, and it seems the Roxy's don't do what they should. So, I plan on talking to him about other options. The switch to Roxy's weren't meant to be much of an increase in dosage as much as it was to be equivalent to my old RX for cheaper.

I've been on opiates for ~10 years, on oxy/Roxy for ~2. When they worked well, they were my fav med I've tried...which is only methadone, OPs/Roxy'S & vics/hydros. This is all I can find on the streets here too, so I can't really try new stuff. I could get a fent patch probably, but usually are ~$60 here and I always just blow my cash on other stuff. I'd try SR, but I'm a little confused and pretty lazy lol.

So, I ask for your wisdom! When I talk to my doctor, since he does ask me what direction I want to go, what should I suggest to him? I know this isn't favorable with most doctors, but he's handled our family's PM for years. Anyway, out of Fent + oxy, Dilly's (IR) and Opana's (IR)...which one will give the best 'warm blanket' & euphoric feeling? Which, in your opinion, is best for actually dealing with legit pain? How much does it cost to get these filled roughly?

He apologized profusely.
I told him I accepted his apology, but, a ""Drunk's man's words are a sober man's thoughts"" and I need some time to sort through this.

So, a while back I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/u58nm/be_there_for_him_or_tough_love_how_to_deal_with_a/) about whether or not it was worth it to keep a friendship alive that has been through some rocky patches.

Well, my friend recently got out of jail, and he is now working for his father, making $12 an hour. Last year, before he went to jail, he told me that he had an outstanding ticket on his license for $125, and if he couldn't come up with my the money by a certain date, that he would lose his license.  I foolishly believed him, and I sent him $125 money through paypal. He said the money didn't go through at first, and it still showed it was in my account on my side, so I sent him another $125. Somehow, after I sent money the second time, the first transaction went through, and he ended up withdrawing $250. I called him on it, and he sheepishly admitted that he had taken out the full amount and had spent the extra $125 on heroin. Later, while in jail, he confessed there never was a ticket, and he spent ALL the money on dope.

So, now that he is working and making money, I asked him nicely to pay me back when he can.  He lashed out, telling me to fuck off, that I wasn't a good friend because I ""only"" wrote to him 5 times while he was in jail (I'm the only one who wrote to him at all), and that I only stayed in contact with him so he would pay me back. (Not true.)

The moral of the story? What does this have to do with opiates? If one of your friends becomes a true opiate addict (not a chipper, someone who cares about opiates above ALL ELSE), in my experience, you may as well consider the friendship over. This kid used to have a good heart, but I feel like it's become blackened by his addiction.  He has said some very hurtful things to me tonight, and I'm trying to tell myself not to let it get to me, as he isn't in his right mind.
Still, it really hurts when someone lashes out at you like this, and I'm pretty down over it. ",1340603232.0

The other day I hit him up and he said that he only had 4 left and that they were $30 a piece. I sent him a message back saying something like ""damn I've only go $25 total to spend"" and he said this: ""fuck I'll do one for $25 but fucking come next week you better fuck with me when I get on deck wit 150 of em"" (he also told me in person when we met they would be at $25 a piece when he got em). All I said was that I would try to pick up a few when he got em if I had the money and I would tell my friends about him. That was all. He was acting so pissed that he was selling one for $25 that day that I said ""Are you okay man? If this is a big deal you don't have to sell me it if you don't want to."" He said. ""Nah I already told you I would and I ain't about to be a dick.""

Now I'm kinda a opiate newb and am not really good at knowing what's socially acceptable to say to a dealer but I feel like I'm in a weird spot  and unsure what to do.


Now that this guy got these pills to sell the other day he has called me and texted me quite a few times. 

At first he said ""I just picked em up, when you gonna swing through?""
To which I said: ""I'm short on cash now brother. I'll have to hit you up another time""
Right after that he said: ""The fuck? You better pick these damn things up.""
To which I said: ""What? I can get some, maybe a few like tomorrow or the next day when I've got some extra cash to spend man. Just not now.""


*Okay*. At this point I started to feel like this guy honestly thinks that I plan on buying all of his pills. Please note that I *never* said that I would *ever* buy a lot of pills from him. *Ever*. Yet it seems that this guy honestly thinks that I was going to.

We have only had 3 short interactions before that just went like:

Me: ""Thanks man here's the money""

Him: ""Ite, hit me up""

Me: ""Okay thanks see ya later.""

Over the past two days this guy has kept calling and texting me and is now saying that ""We've got a fucking problem. If you don't buy these in the next few days we're really gonna have a fuckin problem"". I even asked him if he thinks I'm someone else to which he replies, ""Is this [my first name, last name]?"" I said yeah and that I cannot buy all his pills and never said that I would. He then said that I fucked up bad and now we have a problem. 


I am totally not sure what to do. I feel threatened and feel like I have no way to make this guy stop what ever he is acting like he is about to do. It's to the point where I'm not even answering him anymore but he is still saying ""Where the fuck are you at???"" ""Goddamnit pick these fucking things up"" ""You are about to fuck up""

It's been 3 days since this started and I am in no position to change my phone number (because of my job and clients). I blocked his number but I have still been getting calls and texts from him from three other numbers as well asking the same questions and saying the same things. 


Should I go to the poilce? Will I get busted or have something on my record if I do that? 


What should I do? This guy will not quit harassing me to buy his M30s. It fucking sucks and is kinda scary.

EDIT: He *does* know where I live.

Awesome mods, awesome community! I decided that, for a multitude of reasons, to make a new reddit account...not so much a throwaway as it is just for this sub-reddit. Anyways, I know I'm long-winded...but I'm reasonably high and happy haha!


Anyway, I figured I'd share a bit about myself as well as an interesting story. 


About me...
About 4 years ago, I had to have back surgery (L4/L5/S1 'fusion'.) I hurt my back when I was 16 (30 now) on the job, but didn't realize that for months after I quit. So, I started out taking 7.5 mg hydrocodone at age 19. Had to have surgery a few tears later. Surgery of course didn't help and after being on 10s for a while, my doctor (an ass of a neurosurgeon, who CLAIMED to be in PM but wouldn't write anything over hydro 10s, even after surgery my script was for 2x10s/4 hrs) referred me to the PM doctor my dad used. Started on Perc 7.5s/Avenza (I think it was), then to OP20s, and so on.


Over that time, my habit really got outta control. I would easily spend $100+ a day, and maybe over the course of a year, I had about 6 contacts and could ALWAYS get hydro/almost always get Roxi/OPs. 


Well...as everyone knows, good things come to an end. My family ended up finding out a little while back about everything thanks to someone telling them & so I've just been fortunate to have what I'm prescribed (which is FINALLY 120 blues :) )


But here's my interesting story...the MOST scared I've ever been. I was TOTALLY out without any way of getting cash that moment. So, I went to one of my guys house (he didn't have a phone) and since I had done a LOT of business there, he said he'd hook me up with a few 'tab' 10s and a roxy (he'd always try to help with a little something when I was in this situation.) Anyways, I go inside, talk to him and he goes to get the goods. I was screwing around on my phone, just trying to kill a few mins and about 3-4 mins later I hear ""POLICE! Everybody on the ground, NOW!"" I thought someone was pranking us so I didn't pay it much attention, but I looked up to an officer saying ""GET YER ASS DOWN OR YER GONNA GET SPRAYED!"" They cuff us, and search our pockets. I had an empty bottle for lortabs (I always try to bring a bottle w/ my name & drug on it when picking up), and 1 loose blue on me. My pockets were so deep in the pants I was wearing, so that little guy somehow got in the crevice of my pocket & wasn't found! I was panicked after they searched me, just knowing they'd find it and almost tried to reach for it and take it...but something just told me to keep cool. I did, and they never found it. I was just told to stay in my 'area' and let go. 


Anyways, it's nice to be among you kick ass people. Hopefully I can add to the knowledge and antics of this tight-knit family. Happy nodding everyone! Sorry for the long intro :)

Was curious about a few things when it comes to speed & opiate W/Ds. Sorry for the somewhat long post, but there's a TL;DR for those who don't wanna read all of it!

So, while I'm not particularly fond of admitting it, several years ago I had a VERY out of control meth habit. Several years after I quit meth, *(slept W/Ds off after 14 day bender and totally lost the desire to do more lol)*, I had to get put on Adderall for ADHD, and shortly after that, got put on hydrocodone for my back. Needless to say, I'd plow through my script of hydrocodone in ~10 days and would go thru W/Ds til I got my refill.

Well, through all of this...I found that the addys would almost completely eliminate my cravings and the vast majority of W/D symptoms *(except the pain, which is 10x worse)*. After finding out this worked so well, I'd blow thru the addy script in another 10 days. Then, the vicious cycle left me in the hands of my old friend, ice/shards/meth/whatever you guys call it. I use as little as possible and only enough to get by. 


Nowadays, for whatever reason, I don't go thru the W/Ds of addys/meth. Between these 3 drugs, I could find at least one 99% of the time.


**Now...here are my questions:**


**1)** Do any of you take this heavenly route out of detox town? If so, what do you use?



**2)** Why does this work on a scientific level? I'm not great at science/chem/etc., so I can't grasp why something like speed would kill off W/Ds. I'd guess that like opiates, it just sends those terrible feelings to the back of your mind.



**3)** Why the hell does speed seem to make opiates have almost no effect? I've taken 4-5 blues in ~8-10 hours after a smallish line of shards and barely felt any of them.



...and finally, **4)** What's with all the damn pain in my bosy when taking speed?



The body pain mixed with the desire to get high leaves me taking an additional 1/2 to 2 extra Roxy, thinking that it's more than I'm use to taking *(1 30mg)* so it should have me feeling great. It can also be ~15 hours before I get any real high from the roxy's/for the speed to wear off.



Note that I'm not talking about speedballs here. For me, speedballs are a waste bc the upper drowns out the opiate...unless I'm doing it wrong lol.



Again, sorry for the novel, thanks for the input and happy nodding!



**TL;DR** - Found that Adderall & Meth almost elimate opiate withdrawals. Do any of you take same approach? Why does this work for opiate W/Ds? Why does speed block out most of the opiate high? Why do I hurt so badly on speed?",1340697237.0

Hoping for a bit of help understanding how opiates interact with the plot.","Warning spoiler alert. This is one of those movies that is definitely ruined if you let the details get spoiled. IMO [the movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1691920/) is really really well done so don't let me fuck it up for you, go watch it if you haven't.

The story is told in these little bits where you only figure out what happened from little snippets. I can tell there is definitely some stuff I am missing by some ignorance of the opiate connoisseur side of things. I can tell its one of those where you get what is going on WAY more with a bit of inside info. So some questions:

1) First off the central point of the story - the suicide pact. They always reference ""it"" as in looking for something better. There is some kind of shared referential experience that ties everything together that they all ""know"" and ""believe"" in even though they are all so different in their personality and world view. What is that common thread? Is it simple the nod - the high - the perfect celestial opiate rush?

2) The plot leaves it unclear as to how exactly they met. Its obvious that they all had the same doctor/pharmacy/dealer and they talk about ""getting loaded"" together. There is some emphasis on what brought the group together and the event/place? Is this some kind of group or friendship dynamic from the opiate pharm culture?

3) I'm interested in some of the things the doctor did. He once said ""I can't come down"". Was he admitting to a serious ongoing addiction where he has to have constant usage to avoid serious withdrawal? Also, when he shoved all the pills in his mouth and the med student kid was all freaked out (something about ""you're a demon"") he says ""I'm on vacation"". Is that just referencing a simple binge or does that mean something more specific?

4) Can anybody list to me all the stuff in the doctor's bag? That black case is obviously badass and the director shows just enough labels and pharm names that I assume he's making sure the geeks know whats going on. So whats going on? Is that like the ultimate opiate stash or something? Also later in the movie it seems like the doctor is making custom blends or something (I think at one point its called a ""salad""?). Is what is going on there basically those guys getting as creative and close to the ""edge"" as possible because they have a doctor doing it for them? What is that ""edge""?

5) So when the doc first goes in to try to kill himself the other dude has hidden his stash - all the drugs are gone and he freaks out. So they have to go to the pharmacy so he can get what he needs to off himself. What does he get? Then he powders it and injects and dies in the cool montage. I'm interested in the way a doc chooses to commit suicide - is that really supposed to be the blissful way to go that it seems to be portraid as?

6) During the whole thing they are drinking alcohol. I though that you normally don't do alcohol with heavy opiate usage because of respiratory depression. If part of what these guys are doing is geeking out on opiates and trying to hit them as hard as possible, why would they be drinking? Wouldn't that limit how high they can get on opiates?

7) So there is this bit before the last three start dying etc where they are just hanging around the house stoning. Is what is meant to be portraid just the ultimate few days of stoning that any opiate junkie would want if they were about to die? Is the idea that before they kill themselves that they are just spending a few days in the ultimate pleasurable opiates state? Heroin heaven?

8) From what I can tell the writer/director seems to be asking a question that is posed - almost an ideological gauntlet/challenge thrown down - by the existence of the opiate high/rush. Is he poking at some kind of question that is universal to the hardheaded opiate community? I get the impression that the storyteller is asking something very important to the kind of people who would fully understand the story. Does that make sense and do you have any insight on this?

9) This is a little more about interpreting the story than opiates, but I wonder if any of you have insight on what specifically each of the characters might represent. From what I can tell, they each have their own specific understanding and relationship with opiates and getting high. Do these guys represent standard stereotypes in the opiate user world? Some of the disagreements they have, are those kind of standard ongoing arguments in the opiate community? Another way to phrase the question is that it seems like each guy had an idea of what might be better/more fulfilling than the opiate high (expression, love, responsibility and lifesaving) and they were doing a group experiment to test all the options. Is this the kind of thought experiment that makes sense or is interesting to someone who understands the perfect opiate high/rush?",1340655268.0

If you only train one part of your body (and that's all a single drug like dro is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for failure down the road. I've seen it a hundred times. It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine. Dros basically only train certain liver enzymes and to some extent, the bowels. What you really want to do is train your entire body, all the major opioids (dros and kpins, YOLO!) at the same time, over the course of a session. And don't forget your 2mg of kpins! I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with narcotics, eating right, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make. But do it right, okay? My advice, find a good dealer with qualified sources who will design your addiction for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for self-importance. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is). And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being high the first time you walk into the pharmacy with a gun. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.

I did not write this thread. N0 W4RN1NG from totse.com BLTC is the author of this guide

On to the guide:

So, my opiate experience is now ridiculous. As some you may remember, I had a ""opiate potentiation formula"" that I thought was pretty damn good.

That was when my opiate use was, TOPS, once a month. Now, I use several times a week, and only to keep my tolerance from rising and to avoid becoming physically dependant do I limit my indulgence.

And, in my opiate-induced generally junk-driven journey's, I have seriously revised my famous formula. Here it is, in all it's new, revamped glory:

That said, to get the ABSOLUTE MOST out of your opiate, try N0 W4RN1NG's patented opioid potentiation formula:

* T-45) 600mg Tagamet HB(Cimetidine HCl), a large glass of tonic water (or another source of quinine), and a large glass of (white) Grapefruit juice, preferably from concentrate.
* T-35) 30mg DXM HBr, 4mg CPM, 25mg Benadryl(Diphenhydramine HCl), 330mg Naproxen(Aleve).
* T-20) 2 Tums OR 1.5 Tbsp. of Baking SODA. (Obviously this step only applies if you are eating your opes)
* T-0) Parachute\chew\rail\bang your opiate\opioid.
* T+10) Smoke a bowl or two. Not more, you don't want to over power it.

In depth explanation:

The Tagamet HB (Cimetidine) is a broad CYP450 inhibitor. This basically means it 'clogs' the enzymes that metabolize opiates\opioids and clear 'em out of the body. Tagamet HB tablets are 200mg each, so the recommended 600mg is 3 tabs. They're OTC, and you can get a box of 50 generic 200mg cimetidine tabs at CVS for like $5.49.

Quinine is an ingredient in tonic water, and functions the same way as Tagamet. It inhibits the CYP450 set, more specifically, CYP2D6. It doesn't 'clog' as many enzymes as Tagamet does, but it STRONGLY 'clogs' CYP2D6, which is the MAIN enzyme for opiates like oxycodone, heroin, hydromorphone, etc. A large glass of straight tonic water is plenty. I prefer the ""Vintage"" brand. You can buy a liter of tonic water at any grocery for like $2.00.

White grapefruit juice contains three ingredients that clog the CYP450 set. However, it doesn't clog CYP2D6 too well, which is the main one for most opes. It does strongly 'clog' CYP3A4 nicely though, and although that's almost an 'auxillary' enzyme for alot of opiates, it definitely helps out. Again, it's cheap. Go to any grocery store and you should be able to get a nice big bottle of 100% whitre grapefruit juice from concentrate for like $2.50-$3.50.

An important thing to note for the grapefruit juice is the percentage of juice. A lot of companies make ""White grapefruit juice"" that is basically water, corn syrup, and like 10% juice. This is almost a waste of your money. You want it to say 100% juice, and also, you want to make sure it's 100% white grapefruit juice! A very common business practice for juice companies is to create 'juice cocktails'. These are beverages that are MAINLY cheap filler juices like apple and pear, with the advertised fruit only partially accounting for that '100% juice' the bottle sports so vividly. Look in the ingredients list, and make sure the only juice in there is white grapefruit, preferably from concentrate.

Nutritionally, juices from concentrate are usually not as good. However, for one reason or another, grapefruit juice from concentrate can contain 25%-40% MORE naringin, bergamottin and dihydroxybergamottin; the three enzyme inhibitors present in white grapefruit.

Now, some of you may be wondering WHY 'clogging' these enzymes is so beneficial. Basically, by slowing or even completely stopping the metabolization of opiates, they last MUCH longer. Also, blood plasma levels of opiates have been shown to vastly higher when the CYP450 set is strongly inhibited; meaning their is a higher peak, and it lasts longer.

It's a win-win situation, trust me. ^_^

On to the other shit. Benadryl(diphenhydramine HCl) and CPM(chlorpheniramine maleate) are both over-the-counter anti-histamines that increase the analgesic and euphoric properties of opiates to some extent. They also help cut down on the ope-itch. In addition, these guys also slightly inhibit subset CYP2D6.

Seeing a pattern here?

DXM (Dextromethorphan HBr, Robitussin, Zicam, etc.[not that it needed an intro on this board]) has a special effect in this formula. Although it doesn't inhibit the CYP450 set to any appreciable extent, it does contribute to analgesia and euphoria for all major opiates. Also, it has been shown to prevent the build up of tolerance! 30mg of DXM a good half hour or so before dosing will definitely slow any tolerance build up if you use this method every time. And with opiates, that's a VERY big deal.

The Naproxen(Aleve) adds to the analgesia and euphoria. Aleve comes in 220mg tabs, so by 330mg I mean one-and-a-half tabs.

The tums\baking soda is only necessary if you're eating the opiates in question. Basically, they lower the PH of the stomach\GI tract [well, technically it raises the PH, but ya know what I mean] which allows more of the opiate to be absorbed into the blood.

It's fine to smoke a little bud, but too much ruins the high IMO. And when I say a little, I mean like .2g, tops. If you have a moster tolerance, titrate accordingly, but if you smoke a few times a week .3 will be perfect.

To further breakdown all this pre-dose potentiation, I'll make it easy for you guys and just tell ya how many pills to take, and the exact way I consume them

* T-45) 3 200mg Cimetidine pills, washed down with a HUGE tonic water\white grapefruit juice cocktail.
* T-35) 1 Coriciden Cough & Cold Low Blood Pressure, 1 Benadryl, and one and a half Aleve.
* T-20) 2 extra strength Tums if I'm popping the opes.
* T-0) Rail\pop those shits.
* T+10) *Smokes a bowl*

The Coriciden has both 30mg of DXM and 4 mg of CPM, so it's good for killin' 2 birds with one stone. No pun intended.

Also, some people are under the impression that all these drugs make the high ""dirty"". They CAN, no doubt about it, but in the dosages I listed, there are *NO* perceived changes in the quality of the high. It really does feel like you took more opiate, minus some itching.

Anyway, that's basically it! Hope I manage to help some of you guys out on your voyages to the land of nod, and if you have any questions, feel free to post.

And if this is too lengthy, it's because I'm yakked out of my skull PLUS 48mg hydromorphone; preloaded, of course, with my all-powerful formula.

...and I'm procrastinating for a paper due tomorrow morning. But that's besides the point. Peace!

N0 W4RN1NG

EDIT: Forgot to mention:

This formula should NOT be used in combination with codeine. Codeine's pleasurable effects are largely dependant on it's metabolization into morphine via CYP450 subsets. This formula basically fucks that shit up the ass. If you're using codeine, just take the DXM.

Also, if you plan on drinking alcohol, nix the Aleve. It can cause some nasty damage to your stomach in combo with alcohol. Same goes for APAP\Tylenol(acetaminophen), so if you're taking opiates with tylenol included (Vicoden, Percoset, Endocet, Tylenol 3, etc) be nice to your liver and don't drink. Liver failure is no picnic, mkay?

I had around 720mg of (apparently) bombs #3, gave two of my room mates around 100 between the two of them and I've been doing about a point a day since, maybe just a touch under(3 * 30mg, once when I wake up, once before I do life shit and once when I get home) usually followed by 2-3mg alprazolam before bed. I've got enough for 2 maybe 3 good tokes left. I plan on doing that tomorrow, I want to save one for my coke dealer, if he meets me in time I'll have it for him.

For the first few days I woke up feeling perfectly normal. This morning I felt a bit glum and physically not tired but just...off a bit. Kinda like when you smoked a bunch of weed the night before and you just don't feel like doing shit but lie down.

Now what I have on my mind is the future of my relationship with this wonderful thing called heroin. I know that financially I can support my current habit indefinitely. I can score a 1/2oz of premium shit for $1000USD, apparently not the best stuff ever but still ""really good dope"" from what I'm told(I've only experienced one particular brand and it was a different one so it would be hard for me to speculate further on the quality). I'm gonna keep smoking for now, I'd rather hit the needle because I'm curious about this rush people keep talking about, I've kinda felt it if I get a good puff first thing in the morning but I feel like that's just a glimmer of what could be. Also the needle is more efficient, I cry a little on the inside when I see smoke in the air that I didn't get with my pen tube, though my technique is getting a lot better so this isn't *as* much of an issue.

My question is this, if I keep going like I'm going what does my life look like. A point a day would cost me about 7 bucks, and with the silk road on the go I don't see myself not being able to score. I read a post from a guy on drugs-forum that said if he could do it all over he would have a 3 bag a day habit and stick to that(he said he got up to a 30 bag a day habit). I figure his 3 street bags are maybe equal to a point, maybe up to 120-140?

I have some more questions for later but I'm exhauseted, two good hits of dope and 3mg xannie got me nodding pretty hard.

edit

So I guess the crux of my question was this. Will a point a day of decent stuff skyrocket my tolerance? I like how I feel right now doing about that much, my life is pretty good. I know it won't stay this good but guy on the other forum said that on 3 bags a day his tolerance would pretty much plateau, was this wishful junky lies or is there some truth to it. Also what kind of health impacts would I see? So far I've noticed I poop a lot less. Everything else seems fine though.",1340889424.0

Loperamide is a common over-the-counter antidiarrheal drug. Most of us here know that loperamide (Immodium) is an opiate. It acts on our bowels the same way most of the opiates we enjoy do, it slows the movements that aid digestion, thus causing more absorption of liquids hardening and compacting stool; constipation. However, it's an opiate that (under normal circumstances) is not active in the central nervous system (CNS). The phrase commonly thrown around is that it does not cross the blood-brain barrier, when in actuality it does. What denies it's activity at the CNS is P-glycoprotein, which transports loperamide directly back into non-CNS circulation, effectively shielding the CNS from loperamide's normal opiate-like effects. It is possible, however, to inhibit P-glycoprotein to a certain degree which allows some loperamide into the CNS and opioid receptors.

#**Background of my use**.
I've been a chipper on and off for about a year, mostly hydrocodone, some oxycodone, and a little codeine; all orally. I've experimented quite a bit with over the counter drugs to potentiate these, and have had success. Currently my tolerance is around 40-60mg hydrocodone to nod. I enjoy pharmacology and chemistry quite a bit and though I have no formal training I have taught myself quite a bit from the internet.

#**So does it really work?**
Short answer? Yes, *especially* for withdrawal. Long answer? Taking loperamide to get high/buzzed with no physical dependence on opiates may not be worth it. My experience last night follows.

I had within the past hour had a sizable bowel movement, so as to avoid constipation as much as possible. All substances below are taken oral on and empty stomach. They are  Wal-mart generic, whole pills. (Dextromethorphan was an oral dissolving tablet.)

* T -1:00 - 600mg cimetidine, normal size glass of tonic water containing quinine.
* T -0:30 - 30mg dextromethorphan, 25mg diphenhydramine
* T 0:00 - 20mg loperamide (10 pills)
* T +0:30 - I'm feeling pretty normal, but maybe just a tiny bit more relaxed. I've been up for only about 3 hours and feeling a little tired. This is likely mostly due to the diphenhydramine. I decide to take 20mg more of loperamide.
* T +1:00 It's definitely working. I feel the analgesia, although I had no pain before. I don't feel my mood being as elevated as I would on say hydrocodone or oxycodone; this may be because I'm also feeling restless and a little anxious. I suspect this may be from the diphenhydramine, although it's unusual because I have only felt this way from taking 50 to 75mg of DPH. The DPH may very well be getting potentiated from the other drugs and the loperamide is having such a low effect it's not alleviating the restlessness caused my the DPH. I decide to take another 20mg to see if I can feel more euphoria and relaxation.
* T +1:30 - My digestive system is going crazy. It's not ever painful, just uncomfortable; it's not unbearable either. I feel sedated, and a little more relaxed than before. I think next time I'm gonna try it without the DPH. My mouth is very dry, dryer than it's ever been on opiates, though still bearable. I'm drinking a lot of water.
* T +2:00 - I'm now to the point of sedation where I don't want to keep my eyes open. I had been previously laying mostly still on my bed watching TV. I turn off the TV and just listen to the headphones. I still feel mostly the same, maybe just a tiny bit more euphoric.
* T +??? - Throughout the rest of what I remember in the night I slept fine. I rolled over a few times to get comfortable which is normal when I'm sober, but usually on opiates I lay flat on my back and am so relaxed I don't need to change positions hardly at all.
* T +8:00 I wake up very sweaty and still very drowsy, needing to empty my bladder pretty bad. My mouth is also pretty dry and my water is empty. I eventually sit up slowly and get out of bed to step over to use the bathroom and fill my water. I feel slightly dizzy and I notice my pupils are fairly constricted in the bathroom mirror. As I'm standing in front of the toilet doing my business I get a little more queasy and my vision starts to grow darker and darker - I feel my blood pressure dropping and I know If I don't lay down quick I'm gonna pass out. Luckily I manage to finish up and pull my pants up all the way before I kind of fall *slash* stumble to the floor and lay on my back. I breath deep and my hearing and eyesight return within a minute I stand back up again to wash my hands but I can feel it coming on again. Instead of laying down I sit on the toilet lid, this doesn't really help and it's still coming on gradually. I feel for a few seconds like I'm going to die and I plead to god in my head, although rationally I know that's not the case. I lay back down on the floor for a little longer this time and go back to bed without incident.
* T +10:00 - I wake up sweaty and parched again, but less dizzy and less drowsy. I still feel the effects of the drug - at this point it's comparable to the comedown period of a moderate dose of hydrocodone, although it's lasted much longer. I drink a bunch of water and am walking around a bit conversing with my mom and sister. I'm still a little too dizzy to function absolutely normally, so I mostly sit down. I'm feeling a little nauseous.
* T +10:30 - The nausea has gotten worse, I walk briskly over to the bathroom and throw up a bunch of water. Afterwards I feel better, and am able to eat some food. 
* T +22:00 All day I've felt the ""afterglow"" effect and my pupils have been slightly constricted. Pretty much all of the negative side effects have been gone since I ate after I threw up.

#**My conclusion as of about 22 hours.**
It is certainly possible to get loperamide to have an effect on the CNS. The experience wasn't overall positive, but it wasn't exactly negative either. In the future I plan on experimenting more with dosages, notable taking less loperamide and removing the DPH from the equation. I believe I may have overdosed just a bit on the loperamide, since I threw up and almost blacked out. I'll report any further side effects such as constipation later.

My family doctor has been prescribing me Tramadol. About a month ago I was out of state for a business trip and had my doctor call in my prescription at a local pharmacy. It was filled no issue. That script also had a refill which had to be transferred back to my normal pharmacy when I returned. Again, no problem.

Monday approached the time where I was supposed to be out (plus a few days). I call in for a prescription. My doctors office is slow to getting to refills. Today I found out that they denied my request and advised me to go to physical therapy or see a orthopedic. It takes time to do all of that, so I decided to go to a walk in clinic I've been to before and had luck getting tramadol at. The last time I went to this place was over the Winter. The doctor said he would call in tramadol when I went there. I discovered it was never called in though, so when I called to find out what happened I was told the doctor changed his mind and couldn't call in pain medication.

Again, I want to point out that if taking my medication accordingly I would have been allowed for a refill sometime last Friday. That's before I called the family doctor again and before I went to this guy. Do you think the out of state thing set a flag with my insurance? I don't think it came from the pharmacy because as far as they were aware a prescription was never called in. Do you think I'm possibly in trouble? Thoughts? Freaking out. :/",1340918324.0

__________________________________________

Wall of text as i am all zooted up and could write a book.

I work as a pizza delivery driver. This combination of the actual job, the location, and unknowing management allows me to easily sell, buy, or middleman deals at work. I dont it almost daily. Sometimes when im selling and a friend can afford it, they'll buy a pizza and I'll deliver it with an extra topping, and they give me a great tip.

Ill also have people come to the strip mall we operate out of and park behind my store. Because we use this door frequently, as this is where the delivery drivers cars are parked and where the dumpsters are, it raises no suspicion to walk out the back door at any time. So, Ill have friends merely park out back and ill walk out to exchange currency for goods, in one way or the other.

So that's the background. Today, I had just got back from a delivery and was finishing up a cigarette while I waited for a friend to come by. Roughly one minute before he arrives, an ~60 year old woman trying to look 45 comes out of the bar next door and lights up a smoke of her own. We make small talk but im getting a bit worried. Seconds later my friends pull in and I walk towards their car, but not before saying ""Oh cool, my friends are here!"" and toss my butt to break conversation.

The woman less than 50 feet away from the car will be able to hear and see everything, and we both know that. My buddy gets out of the car and I loudly (but not yelling or screaming) said, ""Thanks for coming down here man. Im sorry I couldnt drop off the money I owe you directly. Obviously I'm stick here"" as I hand him the money and point towards the store. I then asked him if he had an extra smoke I could bum. He said, ""Of course"" and he went in his car and grabbed a single cig as well as the product.

I turn around and walk back toward the shade next to the woman where I was before, while sparking a smoke. She (probably, we cant really be 100% sure) had no idea what just happened. The first thing I say when I get back is, ""Awesome, I've owed him that money for a couple weeks now and I just got paid today. It feels great to be out of debt."" She retorts with, ""I'm in debt up to my eyeballs. I finally got a job after 18 months of searching. I felt like I had retired!""

Now, my car was at the back of the line, positioned right in front of where the woman and I are talking. She asked me if I knew what year it was and I said, ""Yeah, that's my baby. a 2000 ""xxxxxx"" and we got into talking about cars. She said she used to own a Shelby GT350 back in the late 70's. She complimented my unique wheel and body color combination. We chit-chat some more before finishing our receptive cigs and start to head back inside. While saying goodbye she tells me, ""You know, you're one of the nice young men I've ever met. I hope they treat you well at the pizza place. You've made me very happy remembering all the fun times I had with my family as we all took our turns beating the hell out of that 351 Cleveland. I really enjoyed talking with you.""

I didnt really know what to say. This woman just watched me by drugs and then cheer her up right after. So I said, ""Oh, I enjoyed chatting with you as well. Have a drink for me when you get back inside!"" She agreed she would and we went our separate ways.

**TL;DR: READ IT ITS A DECENT STORY** Older woman watches me buy drugs right under her nose without alerting any suspicion to the activity. (Most likely, we cant really be 100% sure, but she never said anything to reference it. We had a good, spontaneous plan) We then talked about cars over a cigarette and she went back into the bar more cheerful and happy then when she came out.

Every fourth Saturday my mother in law watches my two daughters so my wife and I can make the hour trek to our PM clinic, under the guise of a monthly tee time. Things were great today as always, I got my norcs 10/325(360), and xanex 2mg(60), and she her norcs 10/325(120), and soma 350mg(90). We loaded up for the always great drive back(call me crazy, but that's my idea of great hubby/wife bonding time), not realizing the situation awaiting us upon our return...
We make it home around noon as always, for our normal relaxing afternoon before I head to work, and who awaits us but my wife's mother and father, AND my mother and father(I'm 30, wife 28...our habit is our secret...I own a successful DJ business, wife manages a high end retail shop...I take care of my children in the daytime, wife at nighttime...NEVER get stupid around our children btw, always responsible around them.

Back to the story...
Seems my m-i-l wanted to take our boys swimming today, so while at our house getting their suits, she decided to snoop around for a bit, finding empty bottles with her and my name on them. My parents know about my past, an the fact that I moved across the country years ago to help curb an astronomical H habit, so as soon as they started in on threatening to TAKE OUR KIDS AWAY AND CALL THE COPS I took the plunge, and all the blame. Her parents are very naive when it comes to drugs and alcohol btw, so my decision was easy!! No regrets at all...but, now because of what rambled out of my mouth, to divert suspicion away from my wife, I'm facing rehab, or at the least na meetings...

Please critique, comment on, or add to my process. ","I have never made any tincture before, let alone laudanum. I'm more concerned with potency than with flavor or historical accuracy, but would ideally make a product that doesn't taste horrible. Lots of research yielded lots of different methods, so I tried to synthesize the best bits of each to create the recipe that I plan to follow. Below is the recipe for my prototype batch. Please weigh in with any thoughts, wisdom, or words of warning.

1) I got 65 grams (2.3 ounces) of dried 'Hens & Chicks' type pods from an organic farm that I trust. 

2) Grind them to a fine powder in a coffee grinder.

3) Moisten the powder with just enough warm water to slightly dampen it throughout, massage it in a plastic bag to make sure the mash is evenly moistened.

4) Freeze this mash in order to rupture the cell walls allowing for maximum extraction. 

5) Defrost the mash, spread it out on a cooking tray, and let it dry.

6) Vigorously stir the powder into a dark-colored jar with 190 proof grain alcohol. I plan to pour in enough so that all the poppy powder is floating in and exposed to the alcohol. I have 750ml of it, and it's hard to get where I live so I'd like to stick with the full bottle or less. (Any suggestions for determining ideal amount? I want a concentrated, potent final product. Also, here's where I may add spices - anise, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, safran. Any suggestions on a good spice combo and measurements to use?)

7) Keep it in the dark, cool basement for 2 months, shaking it every few days.

8) Use a cheese cloth or old cotton t-shirt as a filter (or should I use something else?) to remove all solids, with the remaining liquid hopefully being somewhat decent Laudanum.

9) Take small doses until I get a feel for the potency. 

I have heard that some people use activated charcoal, wax, oil, or fat to increase extraction (or does it increase oral bioavailability?) Should I be using one of these? And am I fucking anything else up? Missing any major steps? I'll be grateful for any input from those with more experience and knowledge. Thank you.",1341283663.0

I went to work early in the morning expecting to work 7am-5pm. I walk into work and I'm already withdrawling and achey from not using for 24 hours, so I'm anticipating a shyte day. (I work in fast food so pretty much every shift is hell, no matter the length of the shift). Yada-yada, i do my job, take out grease buckets, do a little drve-thru order taking. And then all of a sudden my manager counts me off my register at noon. He tells me hes cutting me because i didnt use my ice scoop to make drinks (BULL SHIT ! I need them hours!) And In my head I had no intention of using today, because I've been a bad boy since i got my last pay check, and i needed to take break, or my body would not be happy with me. 

So immediately after being cut from my shift 5 hours early I thought, ""Hmm, what a great excuse to get fucked up, since I have an entire day to myself, and my friends think I""m at work"". I hide my drug use from my close friends because around this time last year I had somewhat of an intervention and a rehab stint, and my friends want the best for me. 

SO I called my D-Boy for some roxi's and he said he had to re-up but he would call me right after. So I waited about 2 and half hours to get my two beloved oxycodones. And I've been withdrawling since I woke up.

I decided Intravenous injection would be the ROA today, because I desired immediate relief from withdrawls and from the emotional pain of my boss power tripping me (yea I know bad excuse to use, lol). 

I plopped 45 mg's into my cuisinart stainless steel coffee spoon and proceeded to ""fix up"". I drew up the light blue solution with my 30g 1cc BD brand insulin syringe through the rightly wound cotton and pulled the leather braided belt tight around my right arm. As soon as I  clenched my teeth on the belt, I started salivating profusely (does this happen to anyone? I find it rather odd) and I palpated my desired injection site. I pierced my skin and registered the vein with finesse. And by that point I was practically drooling with the belt still in my mouth. I slowly pushed the plunger, my heart pounding with excitement, pulled out the needle, and quickly removed my tourniquet.

30 seconds afterwards I felt the most amazing rush I've ever felt in my own opiate/opioid history. At first I felt the warmth in my chest and then it came in waves. My head was filled with pulsating pleasureful orgasmic bliss. I fell back onto my bed while the orgasm pleasure waves crashed over me for another 2 minutes. 

It was great and I didn't care that I got cut from my shift at work, or care that I worked in fastfood in general.

**TL;DR:** Ihad shitty withdrawl filled day at work, got cut early from work because my gay manager is a power hungry queen. I bought oxy to relieve my troubles and I felt the most amazing rush from IV administration(that i never felt before, IV'd oxy before, but never got the *rush*). Afterwards I didn't care about anything : ) .


And I apologize for the disorderly messy post.

one school day we all decided just to skip off and get high together, being excited and nervous as it was my first time we rolled the joint, crumbling the brownish rocky substance into the papers and filling the rest with tobacco, we also decided to neck 3 or 4 pills each and continue to up the dosage without thinking through the rest of the day... we were necking these things like smarties (looking back was a fucking awfull idea considering my mate went to hospital afterwards for necking 20 and i had 15 but i was ok ANYWAY)

about 5-10 minutes later after smoking this joint i felt this surge of warmth cascade over my body..utter relaxation like i had taken a hot bath after a long gym session.. this was BLISS! my head was completely clear, i was grinning from ear to ear,the world looked sharper..more refined, music sounded so crystal clear that i could pick out each individual instrument with ease even if it was all blended as one, my arms felt like tissues just drifting off the air my walking would cascade around them, i could happily sit in a chair and have a conversation with someone if they wanted too but i was happy being in my little cotton world.

 the warmth and relaxation continued for a good hour and a bit until we took a few more hits of a newly rolled joint.. it felt GREAT. i could see what the fuss was about!


We continued to smoke and pop pills throughout the day and i felt like i was on a cloud. the odd thing that brings about my curiosity is..

Whenever else i have smoked weed (only herbal since then) i havent had any of the wonderfull,carefree, clear head high like i did with that resin.. 

all the other times iv smoked since then iv ether been paranoid, too tired to move or down right disapointed with the results. at most on a good day il be more talkative but thats about it, i just cant get excited by weed like those on r/trees saying how magnificent it is.. its not for me. 

so im wondering, was that resin really just cannabis or could it have been something else? as iv never had such a delightfull and floating high like i did with resin? 

Iv asked him what it was and he says its just cannabis resin but im not too sure as others have said that sounds like an opiate high than a THC one.

Any help on what it might be?",1341417358.0

Wanted to say HELLO! and thanks for all the posts, and advice over time. Also wanted to just reach out to the community. 




Here's a little background -  I have always favored opiates over any and ALL substances. Never had regular access, and thus never have had any dependency issues with opiates OR any other substances. Around November of last year, I got a solid H dealer for the first time. My life was a mess and I had a bunch of cash from a temp job on a weed farm. Thus, I started using regularly (smoking only). Decided I needed to kick it around March of this year and got set up with a suboxone doc - alas, 3 heinous days before my first appt with said doc, my dealer got popped, so I kicked with my SO for the first time. Not to say kicking isn't heinous as it is, but I already have severe panic disorder and lifelong depression/anxiety/insomnia - so it was by far the most difficult and terrifying 3-4 days of my life. Stayed clean without any real problem for a few months, until I got my hands on another dealer's number. Have sworn to myself that I would kick on about 5 diff occasions for the last 3 months, but I keep giving in. I still have a ton of subs for when I finally decide to pull myself together and kick. I'm moving with my SO across the country in 2 months so I HAVE to kick ASAP so I can start saving $$. Looking forward to a fresh start. 




At present moment, I am planning to kick next week (had to make sure I had a few days off work as there is no way I could go to work at a past paced restaurant bartending and serving when I am kicking... tried it twice and immediately called dealer in desperation). Anywho... the other night my SO was on some threads reading about kicking, and discovered plugging H was an option. He and I have only really ever gotten high alone or with each other, have BOTH sworn away from needles, and are well aware that smoking can be quite a waste... but we would rather waste than take the chance of IVing and never turning back. So, forgive my naivety on the subject of plugging (or any naivety on the subject as a whole). I have searched for past posts about it. I try to keep my body as healthy and clean as possible to make up for my H and cigg habits. I don't mind the idea of sticking something up my ass, frankly, as long as I do it and know I'm doing it as cleanly as is possible in this case. So, here's the deal. Personally, I could smoke almost a gram to the face in one day, easy. I love nodding off; SO prefers to still be coherent enough to play music and such but my ideal high is so noddy that I light a cigg and wake up to it dropping in my lap haha.. Anyway, since it's been a few months of solid use, it's no surprise i'm a little ""backed up"" (the other day SO and I were trying to kick and he was shitting his brains out all day - but that never happens to me when i kick I think since I barely eat at all, but no denying I'm still backed up). So I took a shit this morning, for lack of tactful wording, but it wasn't anything impressive. This afternoon, SO and I dissolved maybe .3 and plugged it between the two of us. He said he really felt it (prob because he had cleared out his system so damn well the other day) but I didn't feel a thing. So, having done natural cleanses in the past, I decided to do a rapid colon cleanse via salt water flush/enema. SWEET RELIEF. My innards thank me. Anyway, it's been a few hours. seems the pissing out my backside has slowed to almost a stop. I'm gonna give it another hour or so just to be sure, them I'm gonna plug again. 




TLDR: tar smoker, kicked successfully once before but have failed the last few attempts. Gonna kick it for sure when I get some days off from work next week. Until then, experimenting with plugging for the first time. 




Any advice? Re plugging OR re kicking again? All my love to you, bropiates. You have been such a help in the past, made me laugh, helped me fight cravings, educated me, etc. Glad to finally make the leap from r/opiate lurker to bropiate. <3

I realized I had that new ""no abuse"" pills and started to freak out even more, already on edge from slight withdrawals and not getting my favorite.  If you're wondering how I could have been so stupid and didn't realize they were those earlier, it is because this is my first time dealing with the formula.  What is even the point of making 5s that way?!?! Can you do a cwe with them?

we ended up just putting 4 semi crushed up pills in coke for 2 hours, I know you should leave it in there for longer but after 2 hours it was completely dissolved because of how much my boyfriend broke them up first.  Got a slight not, wasn't the same as my precious blues:(

Im 21, college student, never done a drug in my life besides weed until about last september. I had a slight neck injury from whiplash i got in a car accident. The pain was mild enough where i didnt feel the need to go to the hospital, but uncomfortable enough so I couldnt sleep. So my dad (who takes 15 mg oxys for legit reasons,) gave me one to help deal with the pain. 

I fell in love immediately, although i never abused them, I would sneak about 5 a month away and enjoy the high, i never really felt a dependence on them, just really enjoyed the buzz. However, since ive been off from school (early may) and have been searching uncessfully (until recently) for a job, I have been falling into more of a dependency on them, I havent gotten withdrawal symptoms yet, but I realized tonight that I might have a problem. I went into the usual spot to grab a blue, when i saw they were moved, I looked long for them (even trying to take some from my dads friend, who is up from florida and also takes oxy) until i found half an oxy on the floor. My mood changed to the point of being euphoric, where i felt a high before i even took the pill (which i did btw.)

I dont know what I expect to get from this, maybe an ass kicking, maybe just to put some things in perspective. I just feel I have a really bright future ahead of me, and I dont want to screw up my life with this shit. Any insight would be greatly appreciated :-).",1341463354.0

And what do you do when you just don't feel good, ever?  Pretend as long as you can, and then pretend some more.

Some batches for the carbonation thought are done with yeast, or by adding C02. I was curious about how this would effect the opiate that becomes attached to the water.

She was only 17 and had black track marks up and down both arms, you could tell she was already gone.  Living out of hotels and squatting just to get by.  Made my fucking heart hurt.

2: An 18 year old prositute that was pregnant, the father was one of her clients that she didn't know.  Doctors told her that if she quit H the baby could die from withdrawl so she has to keep on using not only to be well, but to keep the baby alive.  She was still working while pregnant and living from motel to motel.

On an unrelated note, it's raining.  Also the last shot I did was a mix of H and G and holy balls I think I went full retard for a good 20 minutes.

Sometimes, they're dicks.","So, I filled a refill for DROS (hydrocodone 7.5/ibu 200) last night. The pharmacy I go to opens at 8am, the phone said it would be ready 10am the latest. I called first thing at 8am, and asked if they could have it any earlier. The guy says sure, 8:30am at the latest, it'll be ready.

So, I get there at 8:45-15 extra minutes. The girl looks in the bin-not there. Spiros, the pharmacist, is chatting in greek with one of his bros. She asks how long-couple of minutes, he says. 

9:00am-15 minutes of gossip later-I say (Me)""Hey Spiros, should I come back?"" (Spiros)""Sure, come back in 20 minutes."" (Me)""Oh-well, I called at 8, and you said 30 minutes.""(Spiros)""Oh, you in a rush? Fine.""
(Takes 5 steps, picks up already filled bottle, slips into bag, hands to cashier, goes back to chatting.)

So, this guy was SO absorbed with his chat that he made a long time customer (me) wait 15 minutes, and was ready to make me wait an EXTRA 15 minutes, because he couldn't take 10 seconds to throw a bottle in a bag. I've been resisting taking my business to the big guys (CVS, Walgreens, etc) b/c I like to support mom and pops-which these guys are-whenever I can.

All of these studies were when the drug was administered in either 2mg or 1mg doeses at the onset of notable symptoms: hot/cold flashes, sweats, RLS and sleeplessness.  Essentially first test, I took 2mg subutex and it almost didn't do anything, whereas my previous experiences have been that I could take 1-2mg subuxone and experience 85-100% relief.  This is about a 200+mg per day habit mind you.  So I became suspicious that maybe the two have different efficacy.  After taking that 2mg of subutex, I also noticed that I had to redose faster and with the same dose in order to maintain relief.  However, with suboxone I almost certainly could halve my dose each consecutive day until dropping off completely.  The second part involved my taking 1mg subuxone at the same onset of w/d and it provided almost full relief that lasted roughly 24 hours, rather than the 16 hours or so of shitty relief from 2mg subutex.

Conclusion: it appears that somehow, subutex seems to provide shorter lasting and less effective relief at the same or higher doses than suboxone in the same test subject over a course of two weeks with no noted increase in tolerance.

w4wqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/w4wqp/the_sober_games_long_saga_with_tramadol_advice/,17,https://redd.it/w4wqp,JohnDivney,"The Sober Games - Long Saga with Tramadol, advice request","So I just found this subreddit and thought I'd share my story. I posted a year ago to Askreddit about this and got some good advice, but I thought I should update by posting in this forum, where I've seen such great advice. I've read literally every post and comment that came up when I searched for Tramadol, and I'm both shocked and frightened by the similarity of my experience with others who have posted. I'll start with the good news, I'm currently at no more than 70 mg. daily, 1-2 days off per week. This all started when I had a herniated disc in my back (two years ago) and the doc would give me absolutely nothing for the pain and then a veterinarian friend said ""try this Tramadol."" I went in and told my doc how I was able to stretch for the first time in months, and since then I've had a script of 30 x 50mg monthly. I didn't mention to him how I was able to clean my house, shed, and basement for the first time in months as well! Ha!

The bad news is that I was 3-4 days off per week before going on a 9 day break back in April. So I'm finally at that ""daily"" point and feeling guilty as hell about it. That break back in April ""taught"" me that I could go clean lickity-split, so why worry? Bad logic. When I had in the past gone 3 days off, I'd get a bought of nasty depression, a cloudy kind of feeling, like being under a glass bell, RLS symptoms, and like clockwork I'd wake up at exactly 4:00 a.m., wide awake, almost like a switch went off and the Tramadol was ""done"" with me at last. Yes, even at no more than 70 mg, I'd get these effects. What did these wd's tell me? Well, that once I'd weathered them, my tolerance was down and I was ""eligible"" for another dose! Woo Hoo! Time to celebrate, eh? (*Auld Lang Syne* actually plays in my head when I dose on these days, lol.)

So for about three months now, I've been up to near-daily use (if I'm taking a day off I do big hikes, like 10 mile hikes, and I can't ever have Tramadol on board when exercising or I get a severe headache, prolly related to a blood pressure drop). The pill genie has a few tricks I can share with you (but don't recommend adopting yourself). One, my friends are all daily pot users in order to function, so am I really worse than them? Two, I haven't increased my dosage since I first started on these, two years ago. Three, and this is the big one, Tramadol has inspired ""The Sober Games."" I'm not an alcoholic, but I do drink a fair bit, and Tramadol has dramatically curtailed my use and desire to consume alcohol, which gives me powerful hangovers. If I have a big social gathering to go to, I just dose up around 3:00 p.m. (instead of 10:00 a.m.) and enjoy a calm, peacable feeling without finding myself drunk at any point.

So, in many respects, I can say Tramadol improves my life. I don't ""need"" it this much for back pain, but there are days that are supposed to be ""tolerance breaks"" that I can't get through because of the back pain. But the real reason I use it is for concentration and productivity, no different than what everyone touts as benefits on this forum. Yes, I get it that for some people it has no effect, its highly individual and many people think it does nothing.

I'm looking for people's feedback because I'm afraid the concentration/productivity benefits are declining and I'm going to be stuck with one of two choices: higher dosages or quitting entirely. Now that it is such an integral part of my life, I'm mostly worried about how I'm going to fight through the tasks of a busy day without. When I look at my schedule, see all this little shit I have to get done, the first thing I think is, ""of course I'm going to need some Tramdaol to get all this done. Today is certainly not a day I can afford to take off!"" 

I guess I'm having a hard time formulating a question here, but I do appreciate any similar experiences shared below and suggestions. I should also mention that I had been taking a very small amount of Adderall, 5-10 mg. daily, (another common story among Tram users) since 2005 and I've weaned myself off of these with Tramadol. The solution to my problem might be going back to Adderall, I don't know. I don't even know what I want. Do I want to be where I'm at? Maybe. Do I want to get back to better chipping? Sure, I guess. I don't know. Do I want to quit altogether and becomes a fitness freak? Who doesn't? I never thought I'd be stuck in this situation where I can objectively look at my life and say that yes, it is improved by frequent/intermittent use of an opiod narcotic. I'm not seeing my life destroyed or compromised in any way, but is this fate looming just around the bend? Thanks everyone for listening and sharing.",1341593801.0

Here is the guide copy / pasted here.





 Not sure if this is the right forum for this, but if you've been snorting stuff with a bill or tube of any kind, you've been doing it wrong.

I know how that sounds, but check this out:

You will need: - bendy drinking straw - some kind of soft tape or wax **** EDIT - Parafilm is the ideal thing

Blow it up your nose (http://www.directhaler.com/frame.cfm/cms/sprog=1/grp=6/menu=1/)

http://www.directhaler.com/items/nasal_pat_01.jpg

So the deal with conventional snorting is that you're basically inhaling the powder through your nose; a good deal of it, if not most, just goes down into your lungs. Some of it gets into your nasal membrane, but the path of the air draws the powder over the floor of your sinus cavity and down your throat, totally missing all that surface area in your upper sinus.

Enter the humble drinking straw, cut to length (see the link), with one end padded with tape to make it easier on your nose. The other end, after scooping up your powder, is put in the mouth. You then blow the powder up your nose through the straw.

The benefits of this approach are: - When you exhale, the flap at the back of your throat closes, preventing powder from getting down into your lungs. This also leaves no other path for the powder than to evenly coat your entire sinus, and exit out the other nostril. So basically it gives you total coverage with WAY more absorption without getting any shit in your lungs. It also works even if you have a stuffy nose.

One tip is to inhale completely (fill your lungs with air) before putting the straw in your mouth. You are so conditioned to inhale drugs that you will otherwise almost certainly inhale a lungful of powder.

My tolerance grows extremely fast, I rarely if ever get nausea, and as far as I can tell it would take a truckload of dope to completely stop my breathing or heart.

So I did an assload, and rather than sleep on my stomach or side which I normally do I nodded straight on my back.  I hadn't eaten anything in 12 or so hours and I awake to having vomited pure acid that I breathed into my lungs.**(I awoke exactly as it happened)**  I rushed to the medicine chest and grabbed 10 calcium supplements and smashed em up and swished them around my mouth and swallowed them.  It fucked up my lungs and it was hard to breathe for about 4 days.

Could have been acid reflux burp.  I am not prone to them but once a year or less I'll have one.

My dealer told me that the prescription of 120 blues he gets each month is strictly just going to me and my group of four friends.   I think this is because he knows we are always good with the money he knows we are good guys and are not shady like im sure some other people are who he deals with. This was great news for us because we don't need to buy them all at once, but we know every month we have access to at least 120 blues which obviously as you all know is a big relief knowing that I won't need to worry about where to get from when im feining for them.  

Anyway he was supposed to get them last monday, but he said the pharm he usually gets them from was out.  And that other pharmacies that he doesn't go to regularly won't let him fill there.  Is he just bullshiting with me and wasting my time or are pharmacies actually making it harder for people to fill there scripts.  

He said last monday / tuesday he went to like 10 different pharms all said they were out or that they couldn't fill his script when he has a prescription.  He also said that most of them said they would have what he needed today.

So basically my question is, is he bsing me so I don't spend my money until he gets or is this a realistic situation.

I'm worried because my stash is dwindling and I don't like not having my happy pills

Recently I experimented with poppy seed tea and the reformulated Opanas; in general, I'm always down for trying new drugs. So when my friend picked up some Tramadol from Mexico I figured it was worth a shot despite all of the negative things I'd heard about it.

I took 200mg of Tramadol (safely below the seizure threshold). I wasn't really expecting much but after an hour I felt that familiar itch in my nose. A little while later I smoked a cigarette and it felt absolutely wonderful. I even managed to catch some sort of half assed nod. In short, the Tramadol felt like a watered down version of the opiates that I was already familiar with; hey mu-opioid agonists are mu-opioid agonists. I did, at times, experience stomach discomfort and a mild headache, but overall I'd say it's quite impressive for something so cheap.

when did you realize you're an addict (assuming you ARE one and have acknowledged it)? what drove it home?  
i've heard friends describe addiction from all ends of the spectrum. from relatively harmless but unrelenting desire to it being life-threatening, involving jail time, prostitution and the like.
  
i ask because i'm starting to think i might have crossed the border sometime this year but i feel uncomfortable because it's certainly not worthy of celebration, but i don't see it as exactly negative thing either. it's just a signpost, another event, just a THING. i've been having a rather shitty year across the board, i feel isolated physically and mentally. i want to talk about shit, but nothing is tangible enough to put into words except this and i'm not comfortable talking about my drug use with counselors of any sort, so can we discuss it here? tell me your stories about coming to terms with addiction if you're comfortable. i'm as interested in hearing them as i am in venting about my own life because i think it will give me better perspective. this is a great sub full of (for the most part) genuinely helpful, respectful people who don't judge or preach and i'm feeling a little sappy about it right now. i have friends in real life who are currently or previous users and none of them are willing to have in-depth conversations about it with me. they just call me out if i've done something stupid and they might nt aooreciate it. which i value more than they might realize because i like people to help me learn from mistakes like that.  
  
ps- i'm expecting to be pretty fucking high not too long from now so i don't think i'm gonna be paying much attention to this thread tonight.  
  
pps- i ought to add that i've been chipping for about 2 years. i've never had a problem with intoxicants before. i don't take drugs for legit medical reasons (save for ibuprofen and whatnot) and i treat my recreational use with much respect and care. more than anything i'm disappointed in myself for allowing it top go as for as it has and i feel like i'be become addicted. i'm not really asking ""HET GUYISE DO YOU THINK I'M ADDICTED???"" because i feel like it's different for everyone. i just want to hear other people's stories.",1342252091.0

Now, my H habit is about half a bundle (or 5 bags, or what's supposed to be 500mg but never is) of ECP heroin (NYC Stamp bags... the quality I've been getting lately has been rather good and consistent lately.) I know this habit pales in comparison to some of your habits and is raging compared to other b/r/opiates. But it is what it is. 

I don't feel the need to get on a methadone **program** for this type of habit. I only sniff the heroin and use 5 bags per day at most. I would just like to know what the best way to go about doing a rapid methadone detox off of this amount of heroin would be. (Half a bundle a day.) I don't want to come off this ride with a methadone habit so I'd like to dose as littl as possible and as infrequently as possible. I'd like to know how much methadone I should take and over what period of time, considering I only will have 80-100mg of Methadose liquid that I will be taking orally. 

What should my dosing schedule & amounts be like? Should I wait until I start feeling sick to take the Methadone? (I know it's not Suboxone and I don't have to wait to start feeling sick but feeling sick kind of puts me in that ""Okay, I'm feeling sick, it's time to start tapering down"" mode.) 

I also take 2-4mg of clonazepam daily as I am dependent on that as well. How much methadone should I take so I'm not a drooling idiot? What dose of Methadone should I start with and where should I jump off?? What can I expect to feel like on Methadone? I will probably need to be able to function and interact with new coworkers and customers all day. I don't want to be the new noddy girl. I've got my loperamide, Flexeril, Klonopin and possibly DXM as well. 

So I hope I've described my situation well enough for you guys to make sense of it and help me out with my dosing amount and schedule! 

Thanks a lot! If you need any clarification, please feel free to as. Thanks a lot. Happy nods, happy Friday! ",1342228400.0

wibtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/wibtx/my_own_guide_on_extracting_nongel_fentanyl_patches/,8,https://redd.it/wibtx,fentstructions,My own guide on extracting non-gel fentanyl patches ,"The following method is rarely mentioned due to the massive overdose potential of people who IV the extract, but this is how you can smoke the non-gel fent patches with relative safety. I will not include the step you need to take to IV the final product, but either way, PLEASE don't!! Even small differences in your technique each time you do this can cause enough variation to result in OD when you IV the extract, and it is plain insane to try to IV your first ever extract. PLEASE DON'T IV THIS STUFF. 

EDIT: Forgot to place this warning. High concentration alcohol produce flammable vapors when heated (duh), so please no smoking, no open flames, keep well ventilated, and preferably do this outside. You do not want to spill and start a fire, so please do not do this while nodding. Be CAREFUL!

Get the most concentrated ISO alcohol you can, some pure ETOH (ethanol) if possible, a smooth glass surface to evaporate on, a small glass container (stainless steel is fine), a metal pot, an electric heating element (no open flames). Optionally, a hair dryer and pipette. 


What you need to do is as follows:
1. Place your patches inside a small container of ISO alcohol for 20-40 seconds. This will dissolve the glue slightly without extracting a significant portion of the fent contained in the plastic matrix. 


2. Remove the glue with your fingers. You should be able to easily scratch off the glue by placing the patch on a hard surface, scratch, and the glue will come off in stretchy chunks. If you find it difficult, give it 5-10 more seconds in the alcohol.


3. Now you need to set up a double boiler. I prefer to use a glass dish that is sitting on top of chopsticks inside a small metal pot filled with water. Fill the glass dish with ISO, and bring the water temperature up such that you are getting slight boiling action in the ISO. If you have pure ethanol, mix this into the ISO for better yield (my subjective experience only), but only if you have high concentration ethanol (no vodka). I will refer to this mix as simply ISO from this point on. 


4. Place the PLASTIC portion of your patches in the ISO filled glass plate in your double boiler setup. Depending on the size of your double boiler, you may need to cut your larger (100mcg/hr) patches into several sections. Many people seem to think that the good stuff is in the glue, but this is not true. The actual fent is locked within the plastic matrix of the patch. The heat will cause the fent to be released rather quickly, in the same way that applying a hand warmer to your a worn patch speeds up the release, while the alcohol acts as a very efficient medium to transfer the released fent as it is easily evaporated later. 


5. Allow the alcohol to bubble for at least an hour. I prefer 90-120 minutes myself. Do not allow the ISO boiling to get too intense, as this will cause spilling into the water portion of the double boiler (causing unrecoverable loss). Note that the drops of liquid ISO spilling over from too intense of a boil will be tiny and almost invisible, but is significant. During this process, you will need to watch your double boiler and add more alcohol constantly as it boils away. You should make sure that the water in the bottom half of the setup NEVER gets to the point of boiling.  


6. Remove the plastic patches from the double boiler setup. Do not throw these away. I soak them inside another container of ISO where I collect all my extracted patches. This container of extracted patches has saved me in tight situations. Now continue allowing the alcohol to boil off until very little remains, but be very careful to make sure that you do NOT dry it out. 


7. Pull the remaining liquid into a pipette (preferred) and dump it onto a glass surface. Depending on how much fent you have in the solution, the liquid will be tinged yellow when pulled into the pipette. Personally, I prefer to have 2ml of liquid at this stage per my usual run of 2x100mcg/hr patches. 


8. With your hairdryer running on a warm/cool setting (not uncomfortable for your skin at 1inch distance directly blowing on your hand), push the liquid around on the glass. If the liquid lacks viscosity and bead on the glass with low air flow, you did something wrong, most likely that you did not allow enough ISO to boil off. It should stay in a puddle shape and seemingly form a slight ""skin"" while drying. This process is hard to describe, but you are trying to push the ISO fent concentrate around such that it dries as a large patch/film on the glass. I like to drip small puddles with the pipette, and make 2x2"" sections of dried fent. 


8. After the fent is dried, leave it on the glass, and scrape small sections with a razor for use. Depend on how thick it dried, I scrape 1/2"" by 1/2"" sections for smoking. It will look like a white film, somewhat plastic like in consistency. Smoke this and for the love of god do not shoot it. Please Please Please do NOT shoot this shit. Due to differences in ISO/ETOH concentration, how well your technique is, your temp control, the potency CAN VARY WILDLY. After I had my technique down, I was able to get very consistent quality, but even then I was afraid of shooting this shit. The fent in its current form will be somewhat difficult to dissolve in water for shooting anyway, and I will not instruct on how to prepare for IV. Sorry guys. When smoked, a bit the size of a quarter of a match head will get me good. This was when I was smoking/shooting 2 packs (12x So.Cal balloons of tar/pack ~1gram/pack) per day. I would estimate a single 100mcg/hr patch to last me a good 24hours, smoking a hit every 30-60 minutes, during the height of my addiction. 

In terms of how long it lasts, perhaps putting the patch on your skin is better. In terms of intensity, it is FAR more intense than any smoked heroin, and a large hit is more intense than a injection. However, I would still prefer a shot due to the addictive nature of the prep/and the feel of the shot itself, though that is another topic all by itself. In terms of actual yield, I think it was well worth it. I was doing this weekly when I got my hands on patches. 

Oh, remember the extracted patches you saved and placed together into its own ISO container? Well once you have collected a few patches in there and after they have been soaking for a day or two, just boil down the alcohol in the same double boiler setup. This will get you a hit or two, if you did the above extraction correctly, or lots of hits if you didn't and left a bunch of fent in the used up patches. 

For those who will say that the heat destroys the fent, I must say that I had no objective way to verify my percent yield. However, in my subjective experience, the temperature the 90%+ ISO/ETOH solution boils at should not degrade the active ingredient significantly in 90 minutes of extraction. If one is too concerned about this, simply soak the patches in alcohol without heat, and allow the ISO to evaporate naturally (a 24 hour soak, + 18-24hr evaporation), for similar results, but with actually less yield (once again subjective). I have tried the cold method, and I got less product in addition to the agonizing wait. 

TLDR: remove glue, boil in alcohol, evaporate alcohol, scrape up, smoke, do NOT inject. ",1342201175.0

Have totally deserted my household chores. Room is a fucking STY.

I have a script for vicoprofen (HC 7.5/Ibuprofen 200)x50, I got it with 5 refills, and it's written as take one every 4 hours for pain, so using the math 24/4=6; 6x8=54, somehow the pharmacy I have it at lets me fill it every 8 days. I usually try to wait 2 weeks but fail around day 11.

So, I had today set aside as pop a shitload of hydro and clean day. I am SO MUCH  better at cleaning on opiates. It's. so. easy.  It's barely a chore. 

So, I call the pharmacy to refill when I woke up (at around 5), knowing they wouldn't be open til 10 since it's Sunday...well, they just changed their hours.  Store is closed today-my script won't be ready to pick up until 10am tomorrow. Double bummer-I have 3 really easy but super boring classes tomorrow, back to back to back from 8am-2:30, with only 15 minutes between each, and the pharmacy is 45 minutes from my school. 

Anyway, first world problem for sure, but I had my hopes all up for today to be super happy fun clean day.

Why is it for the best? I take sub, and took one on Friday night (36 hours ago.) This will put another 30 hours or so between sub and full agonist. I was gonna try and wait til tomorrow anyway, but I just caved-now, my decision is made for me.

Random question-I have my scripts filled at a family owned mom and pop pharmacy. They let me refill these sched. 3 scripts at an amazingly fast pace-I once went through 6 bottles of 50 pills each in 6 weeks. Would this fly at a place like CVS or Walgreens if the script was written so it was TECHNICALLY legal, or would a red flag go up?

I experienced a dopamine rush during the first 5 minutes or so and it was beautiful, but then it morphs into a sedating but not at all euphoric high that just kinda sucks. This happens so fucking often and it makes no sense, my tolerance is really low to begin with, and with a tolerance break I should be feeling awesome. The only opiate that produces almost consistent results for me is codeine, but my tolerance is getting kinda high for that stuff, so I graduated to morphine/oxy/H and it doesn't seem to be working at all. Codeine had a 50/50 chance of giving me that smooth opiate feel where I could spend a night in bed, watching Fringe on my laptop and sipping tea, feeling so fine it's unbelievable. These stronger opiates just fuck me up, but do not seem to produce anything good at all. I'm so high atm that I have to close one of my eyes to be able to read, because with two eyes open I see double. Still I feel depressed, sad and irritable.

I realize none of you can probably help me, but it can't hurt to ask. Anyways, this is most of all just something I feel like I had to get off my chest, because it's damn near unbearable.

Having been hard up for any opiates for awhile, I figured I'd buy a couple pounds of seeds and see what's up. 

I let .5# sit in about 1 cup of cold lemonade for 10 minutes, shaking a few times as well. Then, I filtered and drank the liquid. Minor opiate buzz. Okay, so I know there's something to this...

Next, I repeated the process a few days later with closer to 1.5# seeds and 2 cups lemonade. I would say the effects were similar to about 160mg of codeine, or 6mg of insufflated hydromorphone. The taste was not bad at all - just a bit of earthy tinge to the lemonade. 

Overall, if you have a habit this probably won't do much for you other than take the edge off when you're out. If you just chip occasionally or have a low tolerance (like me at the moment), and can find unwashed seeds - go for it!

NOTE: Since the amount of codeine/morphine left on seeds can vary greatly between packages, exercise caution when trying a new batch. I would recommend starting with .5# each time you have new seeds to be sure. Double caution applies to mixing tea with anything like benzos, alcohol, etc.

**tl;dr** .5 pounds of seeds = meh, 1.5 pounds of seeds = buzz similar to 160mg codeine = good time. Seeds vary greatly in concentration of opiates.",1342647523.0

I tell him il try 1 to see what they're about. Ive done original oc's in the past but i guess these one I got today was generic.

I received the pill, imprints M on one side, the other a shallow 5-9-5 imprint. I tried to remove the yellow coating the best i can and then proceeded to crushed it up inside a paper. I opened the paper and immediately noticed the powder smelled exactly like heroin ( very vinegar-y, and also tasted just like heroin); not exactly what I remember about Oxycontin. And the powder had a off-white/beige color, also consistent to dope that i used to get. And yes, I do I know the chances of my pill having been heroin that has been pill-pressed, are slim, but Ive never encounter a pharmaceutical opioid that had such characteristics

After the crushing of the pill, I poured a sample sized amount into my stainless steel spoon and squirted about 15 units of water onto it, and everything seemed to be normal, I stirred it and it did not gell.

Next step, I dumped the rest of my powder into spoon and added about 45 more units of water. I stirred it and still, everything about the solution seemed A-ok. 

I sucked up the solution through my tightly wound cotton and it drew up pretty clear. And deemed it it to be ready to go. The only thing odd (well odd compared to shooting roxies, because Its the only other pill I have experience with IV) thing about this IV prep was that there was a little more than usual, residual powder int the spoon. Which, I guess is normal because this pill is about 1.75 times the size of an oxycodone 30 mg. 

I registered, and pushed off and waited for the rush. The rush came a few seconds later than usual and wasn't as strong as roxy 30's, but the actual rush lasted longer than one from oxycodone 30's. But man do I love that short and sweet rush that you get from the roxy's.

So anyone ever encounter any pills like the one I received? I thought the heroin like taste and smell was extremely odd.

I hadn't IV'd in well over 10 years.  It was a fun thing.  Initially I just let it soak in water and drew off the clear excess water and put it through a wheel filter.  Later I said fuck it and started extracting with 91% alcohol.  Thats when it really amped up as I could get fixed within 20 minutes.  This was something I told myself I'd never do.  Initially I tried to use wheel filters but was having problems.  I thought they were meant to suck the substance up through, but you actually push it OUT through the filters.  I stopped using wheel filters and started trusting the 3/4""+ of packed cotton to do a pretty good job.  (It is a LOT more dense than the typical spoon cotton ball)  When you extract OM you end up with alcohol when you evaporate off which leaves a film.  This film won't immediately dissolve in water, but is likely not very good for you.  For awhile I was wheel filtering the water off this film but I had several problems with wheel filters and felt I was losing too much dope.  Here's a hint.  When you put the wheel filter on the syringe PUSH on filter after it has turned some and you are at the end of the threads.  If you just turn, the filter tends to strip out on the threads and you end up losing too much dope.  It just won't have an airtight fit which is an absolute must.

Oxymorphone stuff was way too to good.  I went through 3-4 stages of telling myself I'd only do it in X safe manner then ended up doing something else.  Self-control was quite sketchy.  I could give someone my pill bottle and stay away for a few weeks but that'd never work if the whole stash was in my possession.  I'll probably IV heroin again if I can find any.  I have no clue how much damage I did through the injection of binders, but I only had 32 pills.  I figure I'll be ok.  If I die down the road from this, then whatthefuckever.

As far as kicking I actually kicked from this stash of oxymorphone several times.  When I say kicked I mean I felt the muscle pains for 3-4 days then it was over.  I have never felt some of the stuff people claim even with a 1/3 gram a day pure BTH habit.  This kick wasn't anywhere near that, but I also had one thing that really helped.  Benzos.  

You see, the problem with kicking is the sickness. (duh) The sickness causes anxiety because you just can't escape it.  You can't relax, you might not even be able to sleep.  You are just stuck in hell.  Euphoria in epic reverse.  Benzos allow me to pretty much ignore the sickness and rid me of the anxiety.  This is so key.  All these little things you can do besides a hot bath are just ways to have you think more about it.  People talk about not going to work.  I've never been sick enough to not go to work.  It isn't that I'm a hard worker, I just didn't want to fuck up my life more AND going to work helps you NOT think about it.  Othewise you'll end up sitting around all day thinking about fixing over and over.  You have to do something to get out of this mindset.  I'm sure they teach people this sort of thing at rehab, but I've never been to such things.  Weed and benzos.  Buy the benzos over the internet, off the street, whatever.  The anxiety caused by being sick is probably _the_ biggest cause with relapsing.    All this shit poppy tea or immodium are just ways people exchange to avoid the anxiety by supposedly alleviating the symptoms.  I figure most to effectively be placebos.

As far as Oxymorphone.  THat stuff is godly.  It has a longish half life (not methadone long, but longer than other opiates..)  The euphoria was divine.  The rush was extraordinarily sweet.  If I could stay on it all my life without legal or health repercussions I  most assuredly would.  Even if it meant never touching another mind altering substance my whole life.  There are no better anti-depressants than opiates.  In this world though people don't want you to be high.  Once you use long enough you become addicted and heaven forbid we have addicts.  Doesn't matter if their quality of life has improved.  People don't want to see you having ""fun"".  They want you working hard like them and being miserable with them.  

I think I'll give up IVing.  It was a good run,  I've done a decent amount of OM and a lotta heroin and little dilaudid.   Once someone gave me 1/2 a percocet which is the only oxycodone I've ever done.  I kinda like it that way.  A sense if pride.  Only reason i got back in the dope game was because I heard oxymorphone was back and it is a legend handed down from generations of previous dopefiends.  I'd say they were right.

For all you young aspiring junkies out there, it won't get any better.  The DEA will continue to grow.  They have a morale cause.  It doesn't matter that they have a NEGATIVE performance record.  They will just use that as an excuse to grow and expand their powers.  Now they're going after pharmaceutical dope.  People will just go back to good ol heroin. Infact, they already have!  You want to feel good during your life?  Too bad.  If caught you need to spend some time in JAIL.  Makes a lot of sense, doesn't it ? LOL. It is a sick world and I'm currently a sick man, but that rivotril has helped me ignore the sickness and this whole oxymorphone thing will be behind me....

","So I've been in mild pain for a couple of weeks with a chipped tooth, but this morning I bit into something and about a third of one of my molars broke up. God, that is one of the most sickening feelings - feeling your tooth break up in your mouth, then chewing on it for a few seconds before you notice what the fuck is going on.

Oddly enough, the pain I had is now gone, but it looks pretty bad. I made an appointment with my dentist but it's not for another 8 days. Most people would stop there and thank god (or whatever) they're out of pain, but of course, what's the next thing a pill popping low life does in a situation like this? If you picked 'call his physician and complain about pain,' you're absolutely right! 

Any tips for getting something good? I'm planning on rating the pain at about a 5, a 7 when I try to eat something on that side or drink hot/cold liquids. Think some 5/500 hydros is the best I can do? I've been with this doc for about 3 years now, and have only received opiates once before, for a legitimate back injury. That plus the semi-legit request for meds make me think I've got to at *least* get some hydro.  

**EDIT - The Results:** Complained of pain but first told the doc I really just wanted him to check it out since I had a week to go before my dentist appointment. He prescribed Tylenol #3s. *But*, the pharmacy was out of those, so they subbed Tylenol #4s instead. 1200mgs in total of codeine.

Next thought is my more science inclined friends gave me two thoughts. That I should be able to run a extraction of the other oils likely away from the morphine bounded to the water (possibly putting something in the tea, and waiting for it to separate) and that with a simple test it should be possible to test the percentage of morphine in the water. My thought is that the testing would be usefull, as it would allow me to try re-washing the water ( same water, multiple seed runs) but to know what the strength was of what I was drinking.

First off, a little back story on myself. I've done a lot of opiates in my life, not at all anymore I've been off them for almost a year at this moment. I've done them all, perc 30s, Oxy 80s, morphine, dilaudid, oxymorphone, so on and so forth. The reason I am here is because I am someone who has never gone through withdrawals, at least the way I've heard them described. I hear people say they're in incredible pain, they feel ill, they feel like ""they have the flu times 10,000"" etc. you all know the story. My point is I've done enough for days at a time where I should have gotten withdrawals. What I notice is that people who claim they get withdrawals are, for lack of a better term, pussies. They build up the withdrawal mentally whereas their body is going through minor physical symptoms of withdrawal they MAXIMIZE this feeling by focusing on all this pain and discomfort they believe they have, and it pisses me off to no end. When I hear someone say ""It feels like the flu times one million"" I want to punch them right in the God damn mouth. It's not AS BAD as you think it is, and your weak mind is allowing yourself to be put in this situation. To be fair, I've never used a needle in my life, but even friends of mine who haven't either would still complain of this terrible event that is withdrawal. After I ran out of drugs or money or both, I would get to sleep. When I woke up the next morning I'd get my ass out of bed and go to work. When I saw people I wouldn't bitch and complain in a whiny voice about ""how sick"" I was or ""I wish I had a little something to get me going."" It's nonsense and I'm tired of hearing about it.

x5mqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/x5mqq/adventures_in_pain_management/,8,https://redd.it/x5mqq,gloria_snockers,Adventures in pain management ,"I'm treated for chronic pain. I won't go into the hows or whys but this has been going on for 10+ years.The known irony for all opiates is they don't really provide much of a buzz of any kind after exteded use. I continue to take them because they still help with pain and going off of them, especially suddenly would be excruciating.

So, every 3 months I go to the MD and among other things he writes post dated prescriptions for the next 3 months. I drop them at the pharmacy and call in when I need them filled (of course within certain time constraints). So, by July 1st I was out of the main pain killing patch that I wear and have to change every 2 days. In fact by the 1st I had put my last patch on 3 days earlier. But I'm a man and take my lumps ... I used them too fast, my problem.

July 2nd-

I call the pharmacy and there's a problem, They're saying while I still have prescriptions for august and September the MD never wrote one for July. I have to call the MD's Office. I call the MD and they have all taken a half day and are not there, Shit. I hadn't slept the night before as I hurt too bad, and didn't sleep last night for the same reason plus I knew I had to get things rolling 1st thing in the AM to make it happen before somehow it turns into the 4th when everyone will be closed.

July 3rd-

I call the MD's at 8:30 this AM. tell them what's going on and could they please call the pharmacists. Now I'm waiting on doctor time and I know how that works ... may not hear back until 6 pm. The Pharmacy closes at 6 pm. Side note, as a chronic pain patient I am always under suspicion and need to agree to certain things such as having an assigned pharmacy that I use exclusively. Theoretically with the new laws, the DEA can kick in my door with no warrant and demand to count my medicines to see if I'm selling them or abusing them.

At any rate, thankfully the nurse calls back around noon and says she's got it straightened out but I need to come and pick up the new prescriptions. By the way, this whole incident I now am told is that the doctors ""7"" looks like a ""9"" in the dates and the pharmacy will not be swayed by any assurance from the nurse, grrrr. By now, from lack of sleep and meds I'm really weak, wobbly and just generally not good, but it's now or never. 

Off to the MD I go to pick them up, thinking while I'm out I should get to a store, check the PO box and find some pre fab food so cooking isn't a concern later. Another side note. My car has a cooling issue in that it doesn't do it welll and doesn't take long to start over heating. By the time I get to the MD office it's temperature is red lining and I'm not doing a lot better, Sweating profusely, feeling faint and wobbly I decide if I get through this i'm just going to the pharmacy and home and forget the rest of the stops. 

The nurse hands me an envelope I thank her and go back to the car. Luckily I open the envelope and find 1 prescription for percocet. I go back into the office and ask if I can talk to the nurse, She comes out and I say ""hey, umm. so, only 1 of the prescriptions is wrong? I was under the impression that there was an issue with the patches too"" She says ""Oh god, it never really came up, I was just concentrating on this."" I hand the scrip back to her and she goes and makes calls. Comes back with 1 scrip for patches. ""I'm confused .... so, the percocets were fine? it was just the patches?"" She, ""Yes, I just talked to them and they said that the whole thing is silly and fell bad about it now."" ""Thank you"".

Back across town to my pharmacy. The main pharmacist is on the phone so I drop the scrip off with a new guy and say ""there should be one waiting for percocets as well"" ""You gonna wait?"" ""Umm, I'll run over to get a burger and be right back"".  I'm finally starting to feel a little more optimistic but as I'm waiting for the burgers I'm sweating and getting really dizzy and faint, I feel eye's on me, others are noticing to. I get the burgers, walk back to the pharmacy, throw the burgers in the car and go in.  The pharmacist sees me and I see a strained look on his face. ""Gloria_Snockers, they didn't fix the scrip for the percocettes"" ""I gotta go across town again then?"" He glances at his watch and says ""They're not closing early are they?"" I ponder for a moment to tell him about my car and think better of it. He says ""the other thing is I don't have the patches in stock, I need to order them"" I'm between collapsing and raging at this point and in my head I'm saying ""so you guys have been talking about filling this for 2 days now but it didn't occur to any of you to order them?"" Instead I said, ""I suppose you all are closed tomorrow as well?"" <he nods> ""so it will be Thursday? I'll be off the main pain killer for 5 days? <actually 7>"" <he nods again>. ""You're killin' me Dude, absolutely killin' me"" <said with a lilt that only implied minor irritation.

I go home as I'm about to collapse. Nearly in tears ... 3 days on this shit and not only is another day lost and I just went out and drove around for no good reason after being awake for 3 days and still no resolution except I have burgers that I'm too nauseous to eat. I call and leave a message for the nurse to call me.The phone rings, I pick it up assuming it's the nurse and at the last second glancing at caller ID I realize it's someone that I never really want to talk to. Too late. He's calling to tell me that my last friend from the old days is dead. Fuck. At this point I'm saying fuck it, I need sleep. I down some muscle relaxants and a xanax. 

The phone rings, it's the nurse. Now She's pissed at the pharmacy too. I tell her there's nothing i can do at this point. No way I can drive, it's just fucked on too many levels. It finally sinks in with someone that I'm going to have major withdrawals <in fact already in them>. She finally says ""look, I'll tape an envelope to the back door of our office so if you can get up here tomorrow you can at least get your percocets ... and I'll also word it so you can fill it at Walgreen, who will be open."" ""Thank you"". click.

The muscle relaxants are kicking in, in the worst possible way, combined with the exhaustion, fucked blood sugar and every other cell in my body screaming for various things, not only do they make me sleepy but they kick in with a side effect I've encountered with them before, restless leg syndrome from hell, so not able to sleep really ... not really able to find a comfortable position I wrestle with this for a few hours and I think I may have gotten 2 hours of sleep. Just enough maybe.  Fuck it, this shit's gonna work I've made up my mind. 

July 4th (early morning)-

I get dressed and head out, it's cooler out, not nearly as stressful ... I can do this. Got to the MD's office, found the envelope, back in the car and to Walgreen. Pharmacist is nice, far too cheerful for 3 AM. Has it filled in minutes and I am finally safe back home. I finally got some food in me. The pain killers are far less potent than the patches ... they're intended to only deal with ""break though pain"" but, they may be just enough that I can sleep. Blessed releif. 

tldr; Holiday fucked up from poor penmanship.

I drove to meet my guy Thursday for some roxy. I picked up about 8 of them and quickly wondered why in the fuck they were not all the same. He handed me (3) M30s, (2) V's, (2) 224's, (1) A215. The A215 was very 'beat up' looking and tinged with white and blue speckles. I figured ""what the hell I'm not gonna worry about it"" and went on my way.


I did the M30s and the V's on Thursday. Yesterday I went snorted 1 224 in the morning and snorted 1 of the A215's last night at 11 o'clock.   After railing the A215 I quickly felt more fucked up than usual. Not the energetic oxy fucked up, but a 'can barely keep my fuckin eyes open' fucked up. I quickly felt extreme nausea and puked. Then again. Then again. This whole time I felt this insane nod that I haven't felt since I took 30mgs of Methadone a few years back. I really do not believe that what I snorted was roxy. The printing on the pill was shallow and the pill just had this weird lumpy look to it. The drip tasted very fucking bitter. After puking a numerous times I immediately fell asleep until about 10AM this morning. Very fuckin weird.


I have been burned on deals before in my area (S. Georgia/Alabama/Florida line) with fake A215's, but those were very difficult to break up and when snorted tasted like chalk, and did nothing.

This is an obvious throwaway.  I've been using opiates recreationally for a couple of years now on and off...mostly oxycontin (thank fuck my dealer has a cache, because they're not making them in canada anymore).  I feel like i've always been quite responsible in my use, and usually kick for a few weeks when i feel like i'm straddling the line of heavy addiction.  Anyways...i've always been extremely interested in/curious about H.  I just have no idea on how to obtain it.  Its not something i can see myself doing regularly, as i'm perfectly happy with my pharms, but i'd really like to give it a shot (no IV, just snorting).  

Does anyone have any tips on how i can score a little without getting ripped off/beat up/accused of being a cop/etc?  I live in Toronto, so i'm sure there is no shortage of dope...i just don't know (at least i think i don't) anyone who sells junk, and i'd really really like to spend an evening at home alone trying it out.

Any tips on how to score would be appreciated, or even alternative/other sources of opiate goodness (I really want to try smoking opium, but it seems nearly impossible to obtain).

(Pain management clinic experienced people needed),"Allow me to preface this post by saying I am not asking how to get pills, this is a dilemma I am facing with my pain management doctors due to my own impatience and sheer stupidity.

I have been going to a PM doctor for about a month and a half for spine pain, have had x-rays and MRI's, all that jazz.  I was prescribed 100 count 7.5/325 Percocet (Oxycodone/Acetaminophen) on July 11th that I am allowed to take one tablet four times daily.  I have a long history of opiate usage but don't have a terrible tolerance but unfortunately for pain relief I needed to take two pills three times daily rather than as it was prescribed ever  since I had steroid injections earlier in the month.  I signed a specific medication agreement saying I would take the medication as prescribed and that if I ran out early that they would not refill it early, which I can totally understand and agree to with the position and scrutiny the doctors face for narcotic medications.  This brings me to the problematic part.

The PM clinic I was going to is an hour away so I got a referral to one closer to me to a known candy-shop doctor who will liberally prescribe narcotics due to his sheer lack of giving any fucks.  The new PM clinic near me has been taking its sweetass time getting my information ready to see if they even want to accept me as a client.  I haven't panicked about that yet since I have another appointment with the place an hour away set up for Wednesday since I am supposed to run out of my pills next Sunday.

Since I ran out early, I have been buying Roxicodone 30's and taking them at the same dosage as I have been my personal stash, 45 mg a day.  I stupidly, foolishly decided to go to an urgent care clinic today to see if I could get a small refill until my next appointment to tide me over since I was worried I'd take more Roxis than I have allotted to this time period due to how horrible I am feeling.

The urgent care clinic doctor was naturally skeptical and I stupidly lied to her about my dosage and told her that the PM clinic approved my taking six a day rather than the prescribed four.  She was naturally skeptical and said that she would have to call the old PM doctor tomorrow to verify my dosage to see if she can give me more of a refill than what she gave me today (30 mg, one day's worth).  She also said she is going to call my new PM doctor up here to see what the status of my getting an appointment with them is.  I would have just told her that I was okay with one day's supply if I thought it would prevent her from calling the doctors but I figured that would be a huge red flag to her, so I played along and told her that was fine and to do what she had to do.  

I am not sure whether she is totally trying to screw me, I understand it is her job and I would do the same thing in her position.  I am, however, concerned that when she calls the old PM clinic that they will naturally tell her that the dose was never changed and that I should not have run out quite yet, despite my having called them several times since my epidural injections, complaining of severely increased pain.  I also am concerned that after she gets this information that she will call the new doctor and tell his office that I lied to her clinic and to watch out for me or something.  My old doctor and I have a great relationship (he knows I work in IT and have a very stressful, mentally-strenuous job) in that he said he does not think I am going to be abusing the medication and I would have a better chance, but I am seeing a different physician than him when I go in on Wednesday since the usual doc is on vacation so this will be my first impression on him.

My question for the PM clinic visitors of r/opiates is, ""How screwed am I?""  My signed agreement at the old PM clinic is that I can not see any other doctors for treatment of pain while I am under their care, which I temporarily still am.  I am honestly in searing, horrible pain even after the 30 mg that she prescribed me today (that is already gone) and my doctor has done nothing to address that despite my efforts.  My plan so far is to be completely honest with the PM doctors and tell them that the treatment and medication amounts I have been prescribed are not sufficient and that I am unable to function, also true.  Does anyone think that my having seen another doctor will violate my contract with the clinic and force them to drop me as a patient and notify the new clinic as well?

In summation, I am fully aware of how stupid and impulsive it was to deliberately do something to jeopardize my ability to receive health care, but I really don't feel I had another choice other than to sit there and be incapacitated.  I just hope that this isn't the end of the road because despite being in physical therapy and having had the spinal injections, nothing but opiates seem to help and I have to be able to function for my job.

Christ, this is way too long, so...TL;DR I violated the contract at my PM clinic by visiting an urgent care clinic to obtain more Oxycodone before my script was supposed to run out, how screwed am I with the clinics?

Any help is appreciated and I have certainly learned my lesson and will just buy more pills from external sources if I ever run out in the future.  I am also VERY open to suggestions on how to bring this up with my doctor.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your responses! I have read each and every one of them and I appreciate your insight. I will try to respond individually if and when things die down at work. As an update, I haven't received calls from any of the offices except for a confirmation call from the old PM clinic to confirm my appointment on Wednesday so they have not cancelled it. I am by no means in the clear until I go there though.

EDIT 2: Urgent care told me they called the new doctor and they aren't accepting me as a patient and wouldn't say why.  She said to just go to my appointment Wednesday and good luck with that clinic.  She also brought up how I had way too many narcotics filled at CVS earlier in the year (when I had cosmetic surgery and was prescribed Dilaudid).  Awesome.  I'm probably screwed with the old clinic too the way she went on the warpath today but I might be able to salvage that relationship with the help of my grandmother having worked with that doctor before.",1343613077.0

Within 6 months I had gone from vic's to perc's to morphine and methadone. Then I discovered OxyContin. This was back in 2003 or so before they op'd them and I was getting the 80's for $30. I was doing oxy's daily for about 2 years before I started heroin. I had been around it plenty but it just took a day where my dealer wasn't answering his phone for me to try it. At first I was getting the powder then I found connects on tar. I have been on tar for years now but still do pills occasionally. I was knee deep in the wave of 15's and 30's that hit the east coast. I mean I used them but mostly sold them and smoked tar. Then I started getting Opana's and I think I cried a little the day they OP'd those things.

Next Tuesday I have an appointment at the pain management clinic. 5 mg percs obviously don't cut it with my previous oxycodone use. What should I say at the pain clinic to get stronger meds? I really am in pain constantly. Sitting down. driving, working. I travel frequently for work too, so plane rides are not fun either.

Also, I might be scheduled to get cortisone shot. My friend who has seen this doctor before said she is pretty strict prescribing meds. At $30-40 a pill for roxis around Boston, I can't afford to continue buying them myself for constant use.

 I just received 2 lbs. of poppy seeds in the mail today from a link I got from another poppy seed tea thread. The main thing i'm trying to figure out is if I am correct in assuming that the white film on a majority of the seeds is, in fact, opium, as I have come to believe. I read in another thread that a guy got seeds that were completely black and didn't do anything. I plan on making my tea with 1 lb and a bottle of simply lemonade. I was also wondering, from a normal sized bottle of simply lemonade, how much of the liquid should I leave in there to use for the wash? I don't plan on using the whole bottle but i'm not sure how much is necessary. 

EDIT: I got carried away and forgot the pics!

I got clean not too long ago, but started messing with roxi again. Never enough to withdraw too much, but did get the malaise and insomnia back. Now I've been doing rox a bit recently, tolerance went back up to at ~150mg a day (fucking quick i might add), and can't really have malaise at work so I've been thinking of using seed tea to curb withdrawals until I have time to tough it out at home.

I usually make tea with around .80lbs of seeds at once. It kills WDs completely, and lasts a long time. One batch in the morning can last til at least bedtime I'm thinking.

I've read about WDs from tea being horrible though because of the half-life. Anyone have experience WD'ing from the stuff? And is using it for this reason stupid?

I still don't feel right,"I did a shot of .13 grams of dope around 11:30pm two nights ago. Later on, I decided to do another shot of about .16 grams at about 1:30am. Soon after doing the second shot, I knew something was wrong. I instantly go extreme vertigo and I lost control of my body and fell down, smacking my head against the wall. I crawled outside and proceded to puke my guts of in the bushes and I was thinking about whether or not to call 911.  I contacted the friend who sold me the stuff and he was freaking out because he didn't want to go to jail for manslaughter (And probably didn't want me to die haha). I decided to not call 911, but I continued puking and I felt like I sweated all the fluid out of my body. I seriously thought that I was going to die and that my time had come. A few months ago, I would have welcomed death but now I'm not so sure. I couldn't stand up, I couldn't lay down, I couldn't do anything without feeling extremely sick. Also, my heart felt like it was beating irregularly. I kept getting this feeling that I couldn't balance and that my brain was bouncing around in my head.  It was like my entire world was being shaken around and my sense of balance was being changed several times per second. Every so often, I would get this extremely sensation of losing my balance and control over my body and I would fall down to the floor. This went on until about 8am when I went to bed. I got out of bed a few times to throw up because laying down made me get the spins and feel sick. The entire next day I felt sick and horrible and had no cravings for dope at all. Today, I still feel weird and I feel like my brain has been damaged permanently. I also feel sick when even thinking about doing heroin.

So, what happened to me? I normally do .15 in a shot of dope, so why did I get so fucked up this time? Is it because I did those two shots so close together? Also, was my friend who sold me the dope really in danger of going to jail? I'm still scared to even think about doing it again.

You know I love each and every one of you. That being said, in the past week or so, a lot of location specific threads have been popping up. So, I have chosen to clarify the rule for ya'll. Posts about your location, where to pick up, how to pick up, what to pick up, are not allowed. Keep it to the roll call thread. Look for people in your area, and PM them with questions.

But only had $20 and 3g of skunk to my name. 

So i crossed my fingers and called up my dealer, I explained i was going through W/D and asked if she had anything. ""The usual"" She replied, being China white and OC Oxycontin (I live in Australia, No OP for us ;) 

Anywhoo, I explain i only have $20 and some weed. She agree's to trade it for two 40mg OC's, So i'm pretty fucking happy. I get on the bus and make my way straight down. Once i arrive, she comes out with a sheet of 6. I asked if i could a few on tick as i was going away on the weekend and didn't want to go through hell. She agreed, and gave me an extra. Then as i was putting them away in my little tin, she noticed some tabs (My 2cI-nBome) She asked about it and i explained, she then agreed to give me another 2, 40mg OC for 3 2cI tabs. So at this point i'm just getting all giddy. 

She then asks, if i would like a hit now. Which i happily agreed. Just as we where prepping my shot ( 1 x 40mg OC) Another older junkie came in, bouncing around, started having a conversation with her as i was having my shot. 

Turns out the junkie, lived fairly close to me and offered me a lift home. So things are just breezy now. Floating, with a free lift home. Laughing.  When then get into the car, and she explains that she gets takeaway Mdone and kpins. Which she kindly offered to drop me off 50mg of Mdone and 5, 2mg Kpins for the one 2cI tab i offered in return. 

I get home, Blaze a few cones of some lovely indica. Nod out for a few hours. Wake up to a phone call saying she's on her way. 20 minutes later, i get 50mg of Mdone and 5 Kpins. Todays is good day. 

240mg of Oxy, 50mg Methdone, and 5x 2mg Klonopin for $20, 3g of bud and 4 2cI tabs. Best deal i've got.

One of the significant (and common) side effect that I have discovered is a diminished libido.  I can pretty much take it or leave it, and most likely it’s the latter.

However, I notice, especially when I have taken more than my allotted daily allowance, I experience what I can only describe as a “brain orgasm”.

Essentially, it’s everything that I would feel during a full fledged nut busting, except I am not physically aroused, and do not ejaculate either.  But the full wave of body ecstasy courses through me.  Repeatedly at that.  Minor stimulation of my flaccid member increase the pleasure, causing me to shudder and quiver just like the real thing.  It’s really weird. And really great.  I wish I could summon it on demand, but so far I have been unable to generate this experience at will.

Is this a one off phenomenon?  Anyone else ever experienced something like this?

I have this one ""friend"" who is a full-fledged junkie. He owes me money, and bags. I'm not going after him for the money or bags because honestly the state his body and mind are in right now is punishment enough. 

I'll always text him and it will always be ""I forgot"" or ""I tried to steal books from my mom to sell but she caught me"" or ""I can't find the Suboxone, my mom hid it really well"" or whatever the fuck other bullshit excuse is for why he doesn't have this, that or the other thing. 

But we go through the same dealer. So I picked up from the dealer today and lo and behold, this junkie buddy of mine offered my dealer 2x the normal cost for Xanax, or so the dealer tells me. I guess my buddy is in a jam, because in addition to the heroin & methadone, my buddy has a problem with benzodiazepines. He must be going through benzo withdrawal. Shucks.

Normally, out of the kindness of my heart, I'd throw him a couple for free because he was my friend. Well, he's not my friend anymore. Now, he's a junkie. I've been burned too many times by this lying piece of shit. He thinks he's got everyone fooled, but the only fool is him. 

And me, but not anymore. I guess I'll just have to let him seize in front of me or something. Shame, really. I guess moving on is for the best anyway. The kid reuses the same needle going into the double digits. The kid got his girlfriend into shooting dope when before she was a tar smoker. The girl is probably using him, which is sad and pathetic, but he wants to feel like a big man, so he can have at it. 

I don't know what the point of this post is, really, except that it seems I have less and less friends in the dope game. Now they are just junkies that I know, junkies that used to be my friends or junkies that never were my friends. 

My girlfriend told me a million times these people aren't my friends and she's, once again, right as rain. It's a shame, but what can I do? That's why I like dealers. There's no pretense. Money for product. Period. When it's someone who's supposed to have been a friend that screws you over it, it hurts. 

I take full responsibility for being so fucking goddamned stupid and naive. I have a number of things on this kid that I could do to ruin the rest of his pathetic existence, but I won't. I'll let whatever is supposed to deal with him deal with him.

I'm trying to kick dope again in my life and I used methadone for about 2 weeks and ended up getting withdrawals from that. So in order to deal with that I've been taking Nucynta anywhere from 100-200 mg a days to stave off withdrawals. My question is am I screwing myself by taking this? 

I'm trying to taper off this but the problem is work. I have a physical job and sadly can't take anytime off to go through withdrawals so I'm trying to get through all these damn withdrawals without missing work.

I woke up today with what feels and sounds like freaking whooping cough. Just huge, horrible coughing fits, very dry, very irritating.

I KNOW I could get a script for codeine sizzurp. I just don't really want one-that shit sucks. I REALLY want a script for hydro syrup-that shit doesn't suck. 

If he suggested a script for codeine-prometh, could I say something like ""codeine makes me SO ithcy..i got this stuff called Hydranet or something once and it worked REALLY well, and didn't make me so itchy..."" assuming I say it completely dead pan, do you think that could work? Or would it still be a huge red flag. 
When I injure myself, I'm just as happy with hydros as I am with percs, so I always just tend to end up with what I want anyway. This is a bit different, as Codeine syrup is the standard bad cough script.

Anyway, just want some advice before I had down to the local quickie-doc.

Thanks

Edit-he ended up looking at my throat for all of 5 seconds and said ""I'm writing you a prescription for some stronger stuff than what you can get OTC.""
So I said ""The one cough medicine I really don't like is that codeine stuff. Makes me really itchy.""
He said ""All cough medicine has codeine in it.""
I said ""I think I got one once called...hydromet? That was good, and it didn't make me itch.""
He said ""Hmmm..yup, here it is. Yup, that'll work.""

Three, is ""freedom"". That's to say, I am trading one addiction for another. If I could strong will my way into getting clean by simply going cold turkey, I feel like that's the best route.

[x-post /r/dentistry],"Let me start off by saying this is the first time I've posted in this forum using a non-throw away account, because this is a serious question.
(believe the details or not, but its the truth)

I've had many issues with my teeth in the past, and current have 3 separate tooth issues... 

One tooth got fixed this morning, but the worst one is the one that causes intense pain 24/7. Its basically infected to the root, AND the root is exposed.... its not good at all.

I have been taking around 40-60mg/day of various opiate-based pain pills for the last 6 weeks or so to deal with this serious tooth pain.

I did this to avoid going to the dentist but, its only gotten worse.

My goal is to do a full mouth restoration/fix, but that's obviously very expensive, so this has been my temp fix..........


SO.... later today I go to the dentist.... a new one, trusted by my family.


EDIT: ** I will NOT be saying this **
~~ ** I am basically planning on saying....
""I have been taking pain pills for the last month or two in large doses and ran out today... I'd prefer to not have to buy them on the street""........ and see what he says. ~~ **


Is this a good plan???????

PS... I know this may read as a (just trying to score) post.... I admit thats part of it... but this is also to deal with legitimate near crippling pain.

I saw a post that was a poem, and wanted to give it a shot. Hope you enjoy it!

Here's my attempt...

Title: Before and After

.

..

In the Objective World

there are many types of people:

from youth to elders; affluent and destitute; saints and the wicked, both rugged and feeble.

Curled, we are hurled forth from the womb to do our deed, plant our seed, make our mark and take what we need to call our lives 'lived,' living instinctual in this creed.

But to those who know (You Know) neither why nor how their know-how knows not Now, there exists a doppelganger stranger than fiction or laughter:  Before and After.

....

In Our World

we wine and dine on needles and pills, 

and whilst whirled and twirled in opioid thrills, 

we spoil the dragon by chasing the foil - our will to get high 

trumps the turmoil of the mind, which reminds us

both Before and After, never to become 'That Guy.'

...

In the World of Sir Junk of Ease:

Once is enough; twice is quite fine; three's a charm

yet more lines must be run via Route Nasal on time.

Light sharply shimmers through chandeliers shaking surreptitiously, showering dancers viciously in this ballroom of addiction...

Ironic, isn't it: while the habit grows, the body slows, and the dance continues to entwine a web of lust, mistrust and rusty rigs until we trap first our body, then mind and soul until we are so blacked out that everything proximate to our weird, wobbly web-world becomes a convoluted vortex of despair and death. 


All that remains is Before and After.

.

..

...


It's a work in progress; maybe I'll add to it later. Hope you enjoyed and let me know what you think. Thanks, and happy noddings!


***EDIT*** So I've read the comments, and I appreciate everyone's feedback.

My question is, when I'm doing my normal shitty heroin, I can take a sub as little as 12 hours after using, and I've never experienced precipitated w/d. Am I going to have to wait a bit longer because of the oxy and dilly? I'd like to be able to just sleep through the night (have a bunch of ambien), wake up in the morning, and take a couple mg of sub...but I'm worried that the oxy especially might have a longer half life than the heroin I'm used to.

I know this probably varies from location to location, but I figure it's worth asking. I'm sure some of you guys have been in this situation as well.

So I get a months supply of 5mg Roxicodone (200/count) and I'm supposed to only take 6 a day maximum. I kinda overdid it and finished them in like 13 days. 

The PM doc tells me to contact the department 1 week before running out to request a for a refill. I've pretty much been feeling like crap this past week since I'm all out of my medication. I will be calling the department and requesting a refill this Thursday since Thursday will mark 25 days since I received my Roxys.

So here's my question: Do you guys think that PM Departments ask that you request a refill a week before running out so they can give you the medication the same day so you don't ever go a day without pills (Thus not facing WD symptoms)? Or do you guys think they will most likely refill the medication on the day I was supposed to run out?

I swear, I have learned my lesson of never running out early because these symptoms suck! I'm through the worst of it, but still..it sucks :P

Thanks in advance guys!

I recommend it.  This story isn't very interesting, but it's long and I wrote it, so I ain't deletin' it!

I stopped habitually using china dope a little over a month ago.  Since then I'd done it twice.  Once after 14 days of cleanliness (1 bag), then again another 7 after that (2 bags).  So it's been 13 days since I've used.  

I've wanted to score so much recently, but with living home (summer break from college), it's been harder.  I can score any day of the week, it's just that I gotta hit up someone who has to hit up someone.  And both of those people live in Newark, which is ~2 hours from me.  So if I want to score, I have to make *at least* a 4 hour drive.  And since I don't want to become physically dependent again/desensitize my synapses *completely*, I don't want to buy any more than 3 bags at a time, which is 3 doses for me, because even at my worst 1 bag was usually enough (unless it was shit dope).

So I asked a few friends down here.  The *one* guy that I know can get it broke up with a girl a year ago for painkillers, so he refuses to get them for me.  It's such a pain!  This *days-long* mental anguish from fiending isn't worth it.  It's not even like it was when I was heavily addicted.  The knowledge that I've been so long without it and just want a taste, yet *can't*, is infuriating.

But alas.

So I've been fiending.  Hard.  I haven't been able to sleep because it's been on my mind.  But then I'm up late and realize I couldn't score if I wanted to at that hour.  What am I supposed to do?

I start thinking, ""Man, I'm an idiot for telling my mom I didn't want the Oxys I got for getting my wisdom teeth pulled.  I would have totally enjo-""

It hits me.  *Somewhere in this house there's a scrip of Oxy 5/325s.*

I figured my mom hid them, so I start looking.  She's pretty unorganized when it comes to drawers.  They're generally piles of miscellanea, but I was committed.

I get for telltales and see none.  I check the first drawer.  ""Huh.  A dildo.  Didn't need to see that, but whatever.""

I check the second, and nope, not a... wait a second... is that... IT IS!

So, I'm walking on fucking sunshine right now.

**tl;dr:  Been basically clean for a month, started fiending, nowhere close to score, remembered there's Oxycodone 5/325 in the house from getting 4/4 wisdom teeth taken out, go searching, I'm walking on sunshine.**",1344945479.0

I did around 3 last night, which is a fair amount for me. Went to bed around midnight. Now, normally, when I do a bunch of opiates at night, I do all I have, and wake up feeling like shit. Like, as SOON as I wake up, my eyes burn, I have to shit and puke at the same time, I'm irritable, etc etc.

This time, I have a few left for today. I woke up feeling fine, actually went BACK to sleep for a couple of hours, got up, chilled on line for a bit, and finally, when I felt like it, did a small line. 

So much of w/d is mental, but for some reason, knowing this doesn't make it ANY BETTER. Fucked, isn't it?

Edit: I got two very polarized answers; one from yxx9, who thinks WDs are all in your head and you can ""man up"" through them, and one from pooey_ass (classic handle, BTW) who said that withdrawals are unavoidable and seemed to infer that I thought otherwise.
I don't think I was clear enough-I DO experience withdrawls, they are unpleasant, and I can't ""tough"" them out. What I was saying is that a big part of w/d for me is the dread, the realization of my impending doom, and how something as simple as knowing some opiates were just steps away alleviated THAT portion of my w/d. 

As rosherunner helpfully pointed out, a large part of getting lit on opiates is the procedure-the drive home from the score, grinding your pills up, drawing up the product into the syringe if that's your thing. When I woke up this morning, having a few roxies left over was like a mini-score. As I mentioned in my first post, I actually managed to roll over and sleep for another 2.5 hours after first waking up at 5:30am. If I were dry, I would've been up and bummed out right at the crack of dawn.

TL; DR: Yes, withdrawals ARE real and at some point the piper must be paid;  that said, a tremendous amount of it is a mental thing.

It definitely helps me get through the withdrawls that I hit every couple of weeks.  Anyway, here's a bit of a back story to go along with my question.  

I have a seriously great connection, a friend that is way over prescribed for pain management.  Anyway, about a year ago I got the idea to hit this person up for pills here and there.  My first score was 50 15mg oxy greens on the cheap.  Had a bit of a bad time coming off of those, being that I was eating them like pac-man.  

The fact that I went through some serious withdrawls freaked out my friend a bit.  It's sort of worked out in my favor though.  See, what happened is my friend now will just give me pills, but usually only about 10 - 15 at a time.  I should probably try to do a better job of spacing out my dosing, but what's the fun in that.  

After finishing up the oxy's, I guess that was the 50 she had left from my original purchase, I was able to upgrade to 10mg instant release Opana.  At first I was eating, but have made my way to insufflating that fine pink powder.  I found it was a great way to extend, by a few days, how long I could get high on my supplied dosage, and with about 3/4 of a pill I could be on the verge of a nod.  It was a good place for me, I have a fairly low tolerance, and gave me about 10 solid days of being high.  

Now, I've run through all the Opanas.  They were great while they lasted, and I'm going to miss those little pink wonders.  But, I've found out that next up is 15mg IR Morphine Sulfate and 30mg MS-Contin.  Obviously, I'm not going to want to insufflating the contin, but if I can work out the IR's, then I'm wondering what type of dosage will help me get to where I could with about 7.5mg of Opana.  Any thoughts?

My tolerance for oxy is about 30 mg's intravenous to get a buzz and maybe nod if I haven't been using in consecutive days. So I figured that I was a ""big boy"" and that I could most likely handle the 4 mg's of dilly on top of the oxy. Ive never shot dilaudid before this instance that I am describing. I had no idea what to expect and was Honestly excited. 

I've never mixed different opiates intravenously, so I took pictures of the ""mixin' it up"" part: 1- http://imgur.com/W0fLz 2- http://imgur.com/63hor 3- http://imgur.com/CSbUo.   <- yummy.

Finally after playing with my solution and taking stupid pictures, I drew up the mix and poked my cephalic vein and my cephalic greeted me with a beutiful crimson flag. Slowly, I pushed down on my ""direct pleasure delivery instrument"" (DPDI-lol- I'm high) and awaitedd the oxy buz and the hyped up dilaudid rush.

The rush was better than oxy alone but, it wasn't what I expected. it was good, I guess I involuntarily closed my eyes to enjoy the feeling. It started in my chest and was a more defined body sensation. I felt the high swim through my circulatory system. It was great but, I was expecting an immobilizing extreme euphoria.

The following high was/ is unique ( I did it about a half hour ago). Its like the dilaudid smooths out the buzzy'ness and jittery'ness that some people get from oxy and it's very enjoyable. I would reccomend it to all. Its almost like the two hughs are meant for each other. If I could I would try again with 8 mg's of dilaudid and maybe more oxy. The thing is I only have one oxycodone 30 and one dilaudid 4 left, so those babies are for my after work reward tomorrow :D . Deff not complaining.

Precipitated Withdrawal is SO MUCH WORSE than normal Withdrawal even if full on cold-turkey.

Here's what I did: A small pile of Hydromorph fell into my lap (for free!) recently. In my normal fashion, I made a solution with wheel filters, bacteriostatic water, vialed it up. (chemistry dork, I love making solutions) I gleefully shot through it all in a 4-5 days and was high 24/7. The last shot was 2 days ago at 8PM. Yesterday, I woke up and was already aching, sweating, had some mild RLS. There was a smidgen left in my vial so I hit the rest.. 1 MG tops. It made me feel a little bit better but no rush or anything... still felt mild WD after.

That relief faded pretty quickly and I was feeling even shittier again. I was aching, sweating BUT IT WASN'T EXACTLY AS BAD AS IN THE MORNING BEFORE THE SHOT. So although I was in WD, that tiny bit of Hydro was still swirling around in me.  
  
Anyway, I waiting 8 HOURS WHILE IN MILD WD (after a miniscule shot but like 24 hours since a proper 16 mg rush dose) until I took sub.

That wasn't enough time. Holy fuck. It sucked. I still feel weird but thank god the worst is over. As many of you know, precipitated WD is much worse than normal WD and some of the effects/pains are things that you don't even feel during normal WD. For one, I had this crazy dissociative/dizzy feeling that was almost like ketamine or something but not pleasant at all. Hot/cold sweats and fever: I completely drenched my t-shirt and practically left a puddle in my bed, RLS(and RAS in elbows) was MUCH gnarlier than normal WD. Nasty headache, diarrhea, full body aches which were worse than normal WD, whiteout and almost fainted when running to bathroom, shakes/jitters/jolts. And of course: deep depression numbness throughout. It lasted for the rest of the day/night until I took some (more) alprazolam and nitrazepam and knocked myself out.
  
The moral of the story (which I've already shared with RL friends) WAIT AS LONG AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN UNTIL IT'S UNBEARABLE! and EVEN A SHORT BENDER WITH A SHORT-ACTING OPIATE DOESN'T SAVE YOU FROM POTENTIAL HELL! And of course, do the math regarding the half-life of your DOC. Hydro is allegedly around 2.5 hours and I figured I was safe but fuck, the next time this goes down I'm waiting like 48 hours(!!)

That's how it's been for maybe a year; before that it was almost daily poppy tea until those ran out and he started going through withdrawals and I asked him to cut it down because I was worried about him. He'd also smoked heroin once and lied to me about it, which really hurt and I told him in the future to always tell me when he did drugs just because I like to know. Today I found out that he's actually been doing pills almost daily for the past year and lying to me about it, both through omission and directly because every once in awhile he'd seem high and I'd ask and he'd deny it. 

Obviously, I'm very very hurt that he lied to me, but I also (sort of) understand why (he knew I wouldn't approve of daily use, and he wanted something that was just his and private) and the pills themselves aren't a deal breaker, but I just don't know about near daily use, it just doesn't seem healthy psychologically or physically. I subscribed to opiates to understand his interest/addiction better a few months ago, and I've seen MANY posts about lying to significant others about use. I want to accept that this is his hobby and something he's not going to give up, so if I want to be with him, I have to accept it. He spends too much money on pills, but he still pays rent and has a job and isn't ""addicty"" in any obvious ways. But how is daily use okay? Can any of you please explain your motives behind using every day, and why you choose to keep it private? I always felt I'd made it clear I was generally okay with his drug use, but the daily thing does get to me. I want to be more okay with it because it's part of him, at least for now, but he makes it so much harder by not being honest. 

I'm sorry if this isn't fully appropriate. I just don't know where to ask about this where people won't automatically call him a scumbag addict just for doing pills in the first place. :( Thank you for any insight you can give. ",1345070739.0

it is very rare for me to experience a rush. If I manage to reach it anyway the rush always seems to last for about a minute and is just super intense bliss and a symphony of joy all throughout my body. In this state I can only mutter a few words like ""wow"" or ""oh my.."".

However, my question is this: Is there a formula for the rush? Because neither big doses nor high quality dope seem to determine it. Lots of other factors also seem to matter like how high you are at the moment, which vein you used, if or what you ate, did you potentiate and how etc etc,... But even this doesn't seem to amount to everything. 

For example I was using with a b/r/opiate and we basically used similar dosages. I was the first to experience a great rush on what I think was the 3rd shot that evening (could have been the 5th as well tho...) with some #3 which is way weaker than the #4 I also had. She did not get a rush.

Later on the roles were reversed. We used the same stuff and the same amount and while she got an intense rush I barely felt anything at all (did hit the vein).

A few hours ago I almost had a friend die in my house behind a locked bathroom door. We got some new gear, CocaCola stamp to be specific. I warned him this shit was especially potent, waaaaaaaay stronger than the shit we had been getting recently until this batch. Told him to do half to a full one absolute tops to test it out, you can always do more but can't undo what you already put in your body. 

Long story short the dude literally falls out, I hear him crash to the floor against the bathroom door. I frantically start pounding on the door asking if hes alright get no response. Luckily it was only a privacy lock and I was able to open the lock with a small screwdriver. I find him sprawled up against the door, lips and face totally blue and completely unresponsive. He shot both bags he had, and this was on top of 5mg of klonopin he had taken earlier in the night. FUCK FUCK FUCK!!! I was convinced I was gonna have to dial 911. I've got some training as an EMT and begin giving him a sternum rub while simultaneously slapping him HARD across the face, hoping to rouse him from this terribly terrifying state. If this didn't work I was preparing to do rescue breathing on him until an ambulance could arrive. 

After a minute of me shaking and slapping the living shit outta him  he FINALLY inhales deeply once and opens his eyes for a second. He still can't verbally communicate and I was still convinced I was gonna have to call for an ambulance. Luckily I'm a bigger dude (6'4) and my buddy is much smaller than me so I was able to pick him up and get him walking around. Mind you he still can't talk only mumble and can barely walk. I was able to keep moving him around and keep him somewhat awake as he started to come back to reality. Long story short if someone warns you that some new gear is more potent than usual LISTEN TO THAT PERSON, THEY ARE WARNING YOU FOR A GOOD GODDAMN REASON!!! THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE!! That would just be bad news for everybody involved. 

Just needed to get this off my chest, I also hopes this serves as a warning to everybody out there. When you have new gear ALWAYS do a smaller test shot to gauge potency, you can always do another shot but can't take it back once its done.  Hope this cautionary tale can help someone else out in the community.

So my friend and I are exploring some drugs and I recently introduced him to hydrocodone and he absolutely loved it. He and I have done shitty coke together before and thought it was alright but just got a connect for reputable good coke and tar, and are looking to speedball the two (insuffilation (sp?) by the way) while also drinking. We have never tried heroin before and want to try it mixed with coke for his birthday

So, my questions are how much we should get for he and I, dosage as the night progresses, any dangers we should be wary of (besides the obvious addiction which Im moderately well aware of, or as aware as you can without experience), and any other general tips or advice you could give. 
Thanks in advance everyone :)


Edit:
So, after hearing everyone's words of caution/advice, Ive decided to have a fun night of coke, weed and alcohol, and then have a noddy day with my friend the next day to help with the come down/recovery from everything else. Thanks everyone for the advice and words of caution! :)",1345165299.0

I broke my foot playing basketball. Without going to dig in the attic for my medical record book, one of the bones that broke is the Metatarsal bone.    I was put into a boot for a few weeks gave a script for 20 Lortab 5s and sent on my way.   6 months later, I went through the disability process, getting more xrays, and test done, and one of the podiatrist told me It should have been fixed and straighten with surgery at the time of injury but that was 6 months after the fact and the bone was already fused back together.  So it healed back crooked and this bone pokes outward and looks like a little knot pointing out the side of my foot. It causes me pain when I stand for more than 15 minutes or so.  

I work an office job in IT and can sit whenever I want so it isnt a huge deal. I draw a small amount of disability every month for it.  I purposely DON'T go to see a Doc because I don't want to be labeled as a drug seeker.  The last time I seen a doctor for it was back in 2008 when I was going through the disability process.  I've got all the medical records documenting everything and would love to have some relief but I feel as if the doctor will just blow me off as if I'm looking for pills.

I did come to realise that many of the side effects I experienced were most likely due to sleep deprivation and extreme stress the day before.  As such, I gave it another chance when I ran out of my Oxy script four days into the fifteen days it was supposed to last (it only works for me in high doses nowadays so may as well use it while I can).  For reference to the Nucynta dosing, I usually take about 60 mg of Oxy a day but the past week I was way overdoing it, taking between 100-200 mg a day.  I have an insane tolerance since I used to abuse other opiates in the past.

What I am working with: about 80 or so 50 mg Nucynta (Tapentadol) tablets

I'm going to chronicle it like this:

Friday: Took about 100 mg of Oxy, last dose at 5 PM.  Took 100 mg of Nucynta around 11 PM.  Slept wonderfully.

Saturday: Woke up feeling like death that got yakked up as a hairball and thrown into a vat of hot oil.  I was sweaty, gross, eyes/nose running, and worst of all in immense pain in my thorasic spine (which is why I am being medicated with the Oxy) as well as muscluar pain and cramping all over my body.  Popped two Nucynta, felt somewhat human in an hour, popped two more about 3 hours after the initial dose and felt fine, went home from work and crashed out for about three hours, then woke up and dosed 150 mg.  Felt great, albeit a little muscle  soreness.  Went to bed, slept like a rock/log hybrid.

Sunday: One of my mystical scheduled days off work, the stuff of legends.  Woke up pretty sick again at 11 AM (I think we're seeing a trend here), took 150 mg, feelin' fine.  Redosed around 5 PM as a preventative measure, took 200 mg to see if it'd make me feel any better, felt about the same.  Took 150 at 11 PM and another 150 at 4 AM.

Monday (today): Call off work in the name of science, woke up around noon feeling somewhat sweaty but having gone from maybe a 10% functionality level the previous days to what I'm gonna guess before the Nucynta is maybe a 50%, so drastic improvement.  I'm definitely kicking this shit and it's working.  Took 150 mg around noon and here I am writing this and feeling pretty normal, although more back pain than usual with the Nucynta.

In conclusion, what I'm here to say is Nucynta isn't a replacement drug like methadone or Suboxone, it isn't going to make withdrawal easy and painless.  HOWEVER, compared with any other detox I have ever done, this allowed me to be up and about, to go about my day, and most importantly to me, it did not interrupt my sleep patterns or give me night terrors, as opiate withdrawal almost always does.  To me, when comparing this with every other withdrawal I have ever done (which includes heroin, Suboxone, methadone, and Oxycodone withdrawal) this was a cakewalk.  I honestly think that doctors need to be exploring this as an option for opioid  management.

Some other things I'd like to add, at first I wasn't sure if this was really masking the withdrawal symptoms or delaying them.  As of this morning, with how much better I feel, I am positive it is masking the symptoms, not replacing the opioid dependence, at least not on all of the receptors.  Another thing is that I have read extensively about Nucynta and it appears that most of the people who switch from another opioid analgesic to Nucynta experience mild withdrawal during the switch but no withdrawal when stopping the Nucynta as long as it is discontinued within the first 60-90 days.  

In summation, here are the regular withdrawal symptoms that I sometimes get that Nucynta helped alleviate: insomnia, RLS, unbearable cramping (still had minor cramping but I could deal), digestive tract problems (bleh!), night terrors, cold/chills

Here is what Nucynta did not alleviate: soooo many sweats (but not cold sweats!), possible fever, muscle and joint soreness between doses, inability to enjoy a cigarette (have smoked like 5 all weekend), overall fatigue

When comparing the two lists, it's pretty evident that  it has helped out with a vast majority of the peskier withdrawal symptoms.  I could definitely have gone to work today too (only on day 3!!) but I decided to give my body a rest for all the work  it's been doing.

TL;DR Nucynta may be the miracle withdrawal cure we have all been searching for.

Any questions, comments, concerns, I'd be happy to answer.  And no, I'm not a troll either, if I were a troll I'd say Tramadol were the answer to all our problems.",1345482780.0

I'm going down the rabbit hole - where this goes now depends entirely on how badly I ""have"" to have a fix. 

If my journey with opes over the past ~ 3 1/2 years could be summed up in a few words or a phrase, then it would be this: ""fuck it."" All the thinking, weighing in from all sides; committing to a plan of action, then allowing myself to slide back into the ""I'm not sure"" category, to saying ""okay sure why the hell not"" to having my conscience jolt me back to ""absolutely not"" and all sorts of in between for minutes, or perhaps hours (or even days and/or months in a handful of cases)... all of it comes down to those two little words for me... Given the nature of this particular substance, and from personal experience, I can only surmise this is just the tip of the iceberg... yet my mind - in every case - at the point of descent into the next level of my addiction is like a deserted island: quiet and deserted. 


I guess I wanted to put this out on the interwebz as there isn't anyone in my life capable of or wanting to understand this process (at least, this is what I tell myself...) and was wondering if anyone else has experienced their ope journey in a similar light, or perhaps maybe it was very different for you?

I have no idea how old it is or even how many mg's there are in certain packets, although all the pills are the same size so I assume it's the same. 

I've had drug experience with amphetamines and psychedelics, but never with pharmacueticals or opioids. I would love to get high off these, but as a cautious drug user I was wondering if I could gather up some advice before I try anything. 

- What is the actual recreational potential of Tramadol? 
- I weight 72kg and have a high metabolism. Perhaps 100mg to start with? 
- Having what seems to be a fairly large amount of Opioids, I'm weary of addiction. What's the threshold amount to take a day/week to avoid it? 
- These could be older than my fucking grandma. Forgive my ignorance, but is there any risk of them being out of date?

EDIT: Took 150mg. Literally nothing happened.

Would my doctor be notified at all if I call in the refill?

(I'm not clear on who gets notified or can see when I request an ""on the bottle"" refill).

I've already done the math on how long the pills ""should"" last me and I'm in the clear. But I'd also like to transfer the refill. It was filled at the hospital and I'd rather pick it up from my regular pharmacy just for convenience. Does transferring a narcotic prescription raise any red flags?

""What good my boy, I'm good now. Hit me up.""
When I asked him WTF happened last night, he didn't respond.
When I persisted, saying I thought he was either dead or in jail, he just said ""I'm good now. Come thru."" Arggggggh. No apology, no explanation, nothing.




So, either my dealer is a stickler for being on time, he was getting some ridiculous pussy last night, or he got popped. I texted him at 7 asking if he was good, and he said yea, so I said I was hitting the road and would be there as soon as I could. He knows I live 1.5 hours away WITHOUT traffic, and it was a friday night.

SO, of course, I hit traffic. I text him at 8 to let him know that I'd only made it about 30 out of the 90+ miles between us, but that it should be clear sailing. No response, but no worries-he usually doesn't respond to little stuff.

I finally get into ""the heartbeat of New England"" at 9:15, so 2hrs 15 min after I made contact with my guy. I texted him and asked where to while sittin in a parking lot. 10 minutes, no response. Text him again, ""You there? Everything OK?"" Nothing. Sit another 30 minutes. This guy has NEVER, EVER kept me waiting more than 5 minutes. At 10pm, I actually call him, and it goes straight to voicemail.

Now, I am terrified of cold copping and everything that could go wrong, but I was NOT going home empty handed from a nearly 200 mile round trip.  I headed over to an area of town known to be mostly puerto-rican/dominican and found a street that looked busy. I roll up to the first group hanging out and ask if they have any diesel. They confirmed they did, and it was ""fire."" I asked for a bun, the guy came back with one. Here was the tricky part-I usually pay $45 a bun, but most people charge 50. If these guys know you don't know any better, they'll tell you its $100 a bun. So instead of asking the price, I just gave him a $50 bill. He asked for my number, we swapped names, and I bounced. 

Hopped back on the highway and did a small taste test-sniffed about 1/4 of 1 bag. It was good-beter than my usual!  I texted my dealer and let him know I had bounce, but didn't bother telling him about my nhew aquaintance.  I'm a bit conflicted about his happenstance-on the one hand, he's been good to me in the past and seems a decent enough fellow, so I definitely wouldn't wish jail on him. On the other hand, he knows I live a decent drive away, and deciding to ignore me because I hit highway trafic is kinda fucked.

Have you ever had a dealer leave you stranded? What was your course of action?

Beyond treatment for overdose, a variant of Naloxone called (+)-naloxone is showing promise as a way of treating opiod-related addiction.[16] By binding to the body's TLR4 immune receptors, substances like herion no longer produce the dopamine needed to generate substance addiction yet retains the pain-relieving effect of these drugs.

But due to my poor diet descisio s my veins were being uncooperative. I had two 30s rigged up but it was taking forever to produce that crimson flag.

I walked to work on a very hot day and forgot to bring a water with me. And I was feeling 'sick' so it was difficult to get food into me. I was pretty anxious too due to the hype I created by overthinking my plan to score and the thought of using. So i kinda forgot to drink hydrating liquids. Litterally, I only drank iced coffee, an energy drink, and coca cola. And all that caffeine constricted my blood vessels, in combination with cigarettes. 

But it was so terrible, I could see and feel the veins i thought i hit but, i would draw back the plunger only to created a pocket of air in the syringe. Its so dissapointing thinking your about to 'blast off' but then being denied the right to get high by your own uncooperative blood vessels.

yvhln,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/yvhln/a_story_of_my_first_iving_experience/,26,https://redd.it/yvhln,fisharms,A story of my first IVing experience.,"I stepped outside and felt the fading afternoon August sun overpowering my eyesight.  I pulled out my white-framed sunglasses I had purchased on my last business trip to San Diego a few months prior.  Not only was the sun a little bright for me, but I knew my eyes were half-closed due to the fact I've just IV'ed a hit of heroin for the first time.  Turning back towards her I grabbed her petite butt and pulled her close for a kiss before I left. She giggled and squeezed my butt in return. Halfway down the stairs I looked back at her, leaning outside the screen door holding her baby daughter Renee, ""Bye sexy, I'll text you tomororw, I'm sure I'll need something then!"".  



I've known Amanda for a while, she wasn't my girlfriend, but baby Renee wasn't mine.  Recently I've started picking up off of her since she is kind of the only connect I have at the time.  The entire time we've known each other it's always been us flirting whenever seeing each other, but that's for another story.


A few moments prior I had been sitting in her recliner and she was getting a shot ready of some stuff I had just picked up off her.  It was my first time IV'ing and I was pretty nervous.  The fact that I watched her open up a new syringe package and she had alcohol swabs and cotton all prepared had put my mind at ease somewhat.  I'm always somewhat nervous about getting shots at the doctor too but Amanda has a way of making me feel comfortable around her. 



She pulled her hair tie out of her hair letting it fall, way down past her shoulders and slightly bouncing back up.  For the first time I had noticed how long it really was.  A very dark brown, almost black, and incredibly thick.  She's a pretty and petite girl, just shy of 5 feet 1 inch tall, and looking great even after just having a baby less than a year ago.  


She took my left arm and wrapped the hair tie around an area just above my elbow.  She made some comment on it being easy to find a good vein as they stuck out and were clearly visible.  She finds a nice spot on my hand and gave it a once over with an alcohol swab and brought the syringe closer.  ""Oh god,"" I thought, ""This is it.""  

I felt that slight sting and pinch as the syringe entered my hand.  ""Definitely not as bad as the shots you get at doctor's office."" I thought.  She pulled back on the plunger, nothing.  She moved the syringe in and out a few times inside of me and finally some blood shot up into it and filled it.  I noticed it turned from a brownish liquid to a very dark red mixture before she started pushing down on the plunger, injecting it's contents into my bloodstream.


She gently pulled out the syringe, a tiny trail of blood followed it for about an inch.  As I was looking and notiching this was when I started feeling the heroin's effects.  A calming warmth flooded over me and I laid back and managed to utter, ""Thank you.""  It was great, like I had just snorted a massive line but about 1000x better.  Almost like the first couple of times I started swalloing Oxy 30s.  It was definitely almost an 'instant nod' effect and I felt amazing.  She put the cap back on the syringe and came over and sat on my lap.  I held her close for a while and we just nuzzled each other for a while in silence.


After a few mintues I was able to collect myself somewhat and tell her I had to go.  She gave me the rest of the pack of small syringes she had bought specifically for me.  ""Just call me if you want to do it again or I can explain it over the phone."" She said. ""You should go on YouTube and other places online if you want to do it at home, there is plenty of places that have information on how to do it safe."" 

""Thanks babe."" I said as I made my way to the door.  I knew just where I'd come to find all the information I needed already.  ",1346022559.0

 So, what the fuck causes this to happen? I really just want to know *why* this happens with only some tar. If it was all tar I'd be like ""well, guess thats what tar does... oh well."" and be done with it. Oh, one last thing about it: wether it burns or not doesn't seem to indicate quality.

I recently really came to like this person, but because in some ways I have the emotional maturity of a 4 year old I drove them away. It hurts, and I think about them, but I've recently had a thought that is bothering me. I think I'm indulging in it as an excuse to think about them, as I try to not think about them, and I'm being ridiculous. Anyway, they were my roommate and here are a few things


1. Completely estranged from immediate family. Claims family member is a heroin addict, and that's why.

2. Has next to no personal possessions besides clothes and phone. No computer, tv, furniture. Slept on the floor for months. Spent a lot of time in their room regardless. Maybe reading?

3. Paid rent about a month late. Claimed previous attempts got lost in the mail or dropped by mistake.


4. Always wore long sleeves. I'm really trying to remember them not wearing long sleeves. It's summer. 80-90+ every day, and I can only come up with one time they wore exercise clothes when they went to run. Wore long sleeve shirts with shorts.

5. Claims they lost a lot of friends over the past year, didn't say why.

Things I didn't notice. Any behavior shift from the norm. Any sort of scratching or runny nose. Any paraphernalia, you know, any real evidence.

I'm just looking for a kick in the face, someone to say, ""No you idiot, you would have noticed this (odd behavior) for sure.""",1346123230.0

I am from Athens/Greece, so English is not my first language! Bear with me! Heroin is my self-medicating substance for 7+ years to combat chronic pain as well as a mixture of hardcore depression and some psychotic symptoms. Free healthcare here, but no pain managment clinics and an overall shitty institutions to treat addiction. 

**The topic of my post: Shit Dealers Do.** *Fell free to post the common dealers' behaviours of your Area. Things we all know and experienced, but in a tidy, list format.*

    Area: Athens, Greece
    Age: 26 - Years in the game: 7 - DOC: Heroin #3 
    *Musician, Lyricist, Poet, Performance Artist.*
    Involved with radical politics, including queer politics, as well as creating new 
    Anthropological Studies about the Issue that Junkies are the new ""other"" of our times, 
    in Foucault terms.

**On-Topic List**

1. Scoring from a dealer's house. He/she will tell you to come in 5 minutes quickly because he has a lot of work. You arrive under their house, only to be informed to wait 10 minutes and they'll come out to do buissness with you. These wonderfully expressed ""10 mins"" actually translate to 30-40 minutes, whilst their phone 'magically' doesn't accept calls. When they do appear, my hunger for my medicine erases *any desire* to file a complaint concerning their services.

2. From my experience, this is a 100% confirmed behaviour. When your trusted man announces that ""this new batch is fire/bomb/take-it-easy-or-O.D."", it is certain that the new batch is of a lower quality, and they try to placebo your brains. 

3. Dealers dissing other respectful dealers. I experienced one instance where a current dealer dissed the new batch of a very dark brown rocky H #3 circulates by another dealer of mine. Turns out, the 'other batch' is actually of a much better quality. Even users that want to support their dealer lie to you, even insulting your IQ by dissmising your objective experience about how the dark brown #3 is awesome.

4. I am an exceptional client. Always give straight money, not even 1 euro less, never ask for freebies. However, when the dealer is on a hard economical situation, he/she will not differentiate, and sell to me the same H cut with god-knows-what, with the other, unreliable junkies that BEG to purchase a 10euro dose every day with only 6-8 Euros. Some appreciation on my proffesional behaviour please!

5. What you call 'ballons' (i think), we call them 'papers'. When a 'paper' is obviously filled with lower quantity, they quickly announce that there are narcs everywhere and to take it and leave it ASAP. They induce a state of panic to their customer, so that he/she will not notice the rip-off until they get home.

P.S. I am sure a lot of bropiates and femmpiates will tell me to change dealers. *However, this thread is about **reliable ones**. I won't get even into discussing the shady, unprofessional ones.*

I hope I didn't break any guidlines, this is my first post, so I needed to introduce myself, and also post a topic that crosses my mind lately.

**Feel free to AMA me about the economical crisis in Greece, and how it is related to the market. AskmeAnything about my Area's uniqueness concerning the Opiate Game.

Day 1: Sic Parvis Magna (Greatness from small beginings) 
However, lets go back in time a little bit. I came home from work one day decided to cook some dinner and connect to Tiny Chat. I meet this very physically attractive female who is also very smart. To top off all of that, she likes to use opiates and she is studying in Boston for the summer. So that pretty much set these things in stone, we have to meet up and chill. So we meet up last week and I was expecting a package to my door step but when we got back to my house it was not there. Oh well so goes the game… She did however have some BTH that she gladly shared with me while we enjoyed some drinks. No talk of how much do I owe you or can I have another hit, we just did it. We talked the night went on and finally passed out. It was awesome, I had never been happier just being with a female who shares my interests in opiates. 

Day 2: Ad Augusta per Angusta (To high places by narrow roads)
So we wake up pretty late and pretty soon the mail man comes by and drops off some goodies.  Before we get into what came in the mail, I want to say this. This girl was not like other girls I have met. Very mature for her age and very smart. Redditors are a unique breed that is for sure. But the r/opiates are the creme de menthe of people So a bunch of dillies and xanax come in the mail. What an insane combo, especially because I was banging the dillies. Needles to say the next 12 hours were very blurry and consisted of the beach alcohol, dillies, and fucking xanax. Xanax causes me to do very stupid things, which I will get into on day 3. Needles to say another perfect day with a great person. I really wish I recalled more of that night, but I said it once and I will say it again, fucking xanax. We just did what I had to get high with and we both understood that was all I had so make it last and last it shall.

Day 3: Sic Transit Gloria (All glory fades)
Well I was a bit off my game for an early shift at work, but it did not matter because this fellow redditor and I were meeting up again and she got another package in the mail. Fucking groovy, work will be worth it.. I think I might have taken a bar somewhere through out the work day 11-7 PM. Anyhow, I get off work, get out to my car and the front left tire is flat. Not surprising I did not notice because I was so fucked up. Anyhow, I figure they won't tow my car I work there (long story short fuck the city of Boston that costed me over 320$). So, I get on the subway take a brief walk over to her fucking awesome pad in a very nice part of Boston. When I get there it was like fucking X-mas,  more BTH! I got to say I never used BTH before this meet up and there wasn't so much a rush, just me fucked up for hours on end. Then you combine smoking it and forget life. I really cannot tell you what happened that night other than bliss.

The days to follow: I realized that this girl was like none other than I have ever met in my life. Given there was an age difference but that was transcended by our common interests. We did not share the best habits, but I did realize something. I have lived my entire year this far doing nothing with my life. No fun, just working 70 hours a week. I also really do not have that much to show for it (thank you internet), which really bums me out. But this girl man, I swear to go nothing better has happened to me this year. I will tell you why: I finally understood that I would rather be poor and happy then rich and sad. That single thought right there changed my life. I am planning to get fired from my job, and I know before you say anything how fucking crazy that is. But you know what if I want something bad enough, I am confident that I will get it. So I am going to let whatever happens next happen. I want to find a job that keeps me hungry and happy for more. Those are few and far between, but I will find it. Crystal, Crum, Josh, and Peace you all have been with me since the dawn of time for me on this sub-reddit. Crystal and Josh I will never forget the time you looked after me that one fateful night. I love all of you and those who need me can contact me. I am going to take a break from this sub reedit for a while. I will still check like twice a week or something. 

P.S. Fucking Xanax

Yesterday I had surgery in the morning, received some 5/500 hydros, took 3 at 1:30pm and another 3 at like 9:30pm so I wouldn't go over 3000 APAP. It barely affected me, made me drowsy of course but I didn't really experience anything else or much pain relief so I was thinking of doing a CWE today (which I've never tried), but I'm not sure how much to do.

And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?,"A friend has had a real nice connect for powder here on the east coast. Good stuff, at least to my unsophisticated palate, and priced just about average from everything I've read online. It's been so available that I've been walking that murderously thin line between chipping and addiction.

But as good connects who drive tinted out Range Rovers are apt to do, our source wrapped his ride around a tree or a telephone pole or drove it into a river or off a bridge or something. Solid information is hard to come by and it's not like there's anyone I can call and ask for the latest gossip.

The only other thing that's been floating around are cheap dilaudid ... cheap because everyone at this party likes to put their drugs up their nose and so no one really knows what to do with them. 

I was going to use this as an excuse to dry out for a while, quit while I was either still ahead or not too far behind. But as I was sitting around counting the bags in my last bundle obsessively I caught that panic, that horrible fear that once these ten bags were gone, I was out of drugs. Besides an expired bottle of Aspirin and some pre-mixed margaritas my apartment would be completely dry. 

And so I folded and bought several hundred milligrams of dilaudid. 

I tried. I tried putting them up my nose ... but it just wasn't good. It felt like something was missing. I googled that shit and there's only one thing to do with them. But I didn't want to take that step. I told myself I'd try plugging them as a compromise. 

Call my uptight or homophobic or old fashioned. Laugh all you want but I couldn't do it. Standing in a walmart aisle holding an oral syringe and a tube of astroglide, it was the first time in my life I've ever felt that level of shame over my drug use. I've been in some dark places but this was too much. And I might be paranoid but it doesn't mean that everyone in that store wasn't staring at me like I was wearing a sign that said ""Yes, I'm going to go home and lay naked on my bathroom floor while I gently shove this up my ass and squirt drugs into my intestine."" 

That image of me naked, holding this greased up tube of plastic in my hand was too much. I walked into the pharmacy and $12 later I had a 100ct of 1/2inch 30gauge 50cc insulin syringes. 

That was a week ago and I can tell that I won't go back. There's simply nothing that comes close to IV.

Stay safe out there kids. Stay away from the needle. Don't do opiates but if you're going to do them, keep them as a hobby. As for me. I'm going to try and take some time off just to see how deep I'm in. I've gone through withdrawals before so I'm hoping I can ride these out and go back to having this as a treat and not as breakfast.",1346294357.0

z44xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/z44xq/so_many_threads_about_addiction/,40,https://redd.it/z44xq,Fringes,So many threads about addiction. ,"In a way, we're all addicted. Whether we chip and only do it on weekends, follow the day on day off rule, or are full blown junkies; we're all addicted. 
Just like any other activity, it's escapism. We're addicted to escaping, and opiates are our preferred DOC. 
I don't know why others come on this subreddit, but I've compiled a couple reasons that make sense to me:

* It's something of a circlejerk, we can all feel better about our use if everyone else is doing it.
* For the newer users; it's exciting talking to a community that knows how you feel and can have intelligent conversation regarding your activities. 
* It's a knowledge base for the noobs who hurry over in a panic because they took five vicodin 5/500's and feel sleepy. 'SHOULD I GO TO THE HOSPITAL?!'
* It's a place to let off steam with people that do what you do and feel what you do. 

Our addiction is escaping. Opiates are our method of escape. And this subreddit acts as a catalyst; it gets the ball rolling and encourages us to continue these...dare I say...'self destructive' cycles. 

It seems like half of us know we're addicted even if we don't use every day, and the other half is still ignorant or in denial- with the outliers being the ""Hey just got some codeine cough syrup, how much should I take"" kids.

I'm not really sure where I was going with this, but it saddens me because I have only recently come to the realization that no matter how long i go without opiates, they will always hold a place in my mind and soul. I guess I've fallen into the ""Despite occasional use, I know i'm addicted"" category. 

Once you go in, you will never come out.

**Tl;DR** Only time will reveal the inevitable answer about your opiate use, and no number of warning threads, horror stories or success stories will change your mind until you come to this realization yourself.

EDIT: I would like to let potential responders know, I am in know way attempting to criticize anyone or act in a belittling or pompous way.

Some notes to inform the non-addicted, and for the already addicted, to share opinions:

I never thought of opiate addiction as a curse. The benzo addiction (and thus the combo) is something that I wouldn't wish to my worst enemy. Benzo withdrawals are actually much much worse than opiate wd's, and though opiate wd's are a nightmare, they are harmless; benzo wd's, on the other hand, are dangerous - they may lead to seizures, coma, death.

I experienced a hardcore seizure after a combo wd. I was on 10(!) mg of Flunitrazepam that year and due to pharmacy strikes, I couldn't find any for 5 days. Even though I raised my H intake to avoid dangerous withdrawals, in the 5th day I had an epileptic seizure and It was horrendous.

Apart from that, you get daily anxiety attacks until you eat your pill, withdrawals are both physical and mental, runny nose, fever sensation, RLS, anxiety, nightmares, and a feeling that you will simply DIE.

Please stay away from Benzos if you use Opiates. It's this very combination that drives people into compulsive stealing, lying, manipulating people, scamming relatives etc. Not to mention the incredible risk of ODing because they intensify the effect of Opiates.

But, as we all know, each curse come with a gift. I know I can quit by using diazepam and tapering for some months, but I don't want to. Benzos ""complete"" the Opiate feeling in a very deep way. I always said that Opiates work on you outside-in (skin, body, organs, ""soul""). Well, benzos go straight to your ""soul"" and erase any anxiety, worry or care that the Opiates might not erase.

There is nothing more ""not giving a fuck about nothing"" than this combination. Please REFRAIN from starting this terrible combination. I know it is difficult to picture, but benzos are much worse than Opiates. 

P.S. Bropiates who already use Benzos too, can share their feelings and (why not) their positive experiences. For me, the pros are summed up by the statement that Benzos just ""complete"" what Opiates cannot: The very deep fields of our minds/souls. Sorry if this post is meaningless.",1346460606.0

Now when i actually got the teeth taken out i went straight for my vicodin when i got home.... and boy where things different this time around.

i sat down with my brother and played FIFA for about 2 hours straight with a smile on my face and not a ounce of pain in my body. I began taking one every four hours. about halfway through the month one pill every four hours came to two every 4 hours, which later became take 2 whenever the fuck you feel like it. i just remember the constant euphoria and being able to nod away whenver i felt like it (i suffer from insomnia so this a miracle).

needless to say the script didnt last the full month

after that experience its been love since first sight, ive always been able to regulate my use well and still have a verrryyy low tolerance (10mg hydros = a happy night for me). ive never tried H and really dont have a want to, but i would say opiates play a pretty nice role in my life :)

Usually she doesn't even need to take two a day and doesn't need them every day.  Lately her pain has been very, very bad and the medicine hasn't been helping much.

I've read here that drinking grapefruit juice makes the high stronger.  Do you know if it would also make the pain relieving qualities stronger?

She just lost her life-partner, who was the bread winner, and money is super tight for the next few years while she gets their home paid off.

I'm also sometimes retarded.. I'm not sure how clear I've been about that part.

Anyway, I can't really hit my elbows anymore, and the only other visible veins are on my hand. So i used them a few times yesterday and once this morning, and they hit perfectly and cleanly every time. Tonight, they wouldn't. So, I turn my hand over and find what I think is a nice fat vein.

I register, start to hit, and I notice it was just like pooling in my wrist..so I'm like fuck and try to re-register, and blood starts SPURTING out-I must have knicked an artery. Now, I don't think I injected into the artery, because everyone online describes a burning, searing pain like no other. This was not painful at all. I've also read the hand swells up to the size of a balloon. This also did not happen. 

I am slightly sore at the injection site and a little swollen. Aside from some pysch out moments where I'm just scaring myself, my hand really isn't numb. 

From reading bluelight entries, when people definitely DO hit an artery, and the hand swells to balloon like size-people recommend running to the nearest ER. I'd really like to avoid that. I'm going to keep an eye on my wrist/hand and stay up longer than I'd like to. If it hasn't swollen at all yet/isn't numb, am I basically in the clear?

If someone could answer this tonight, it would ease my mind, either way.   
Feel free to call me an idiot..I certainly feel like one/deserve it.

Thanks

Edit-it's been almost 2 hours now, still only localized (the injection site) very minor swelling, minor soreness, and no numbness. Does it ever come on HOURS later? Really, anyone who knows anything about this, please pipe up. Thanks fam",1346905889.0

He IS going to say something, quite soon, and I need a reason for my (admittedly) irresponsible spending. I'm debating between making up some bullshit reason, or just coming clean and saying I have a drug issue and need some help. I would never say it was dope;  instead, I would say it's painkillers, which is close enough but would make the blow way easier.

I think the ease of this kick is due to the fact that I came prepared this time (benzos, paracetamol, loperamide, clonidine, lots of vitamins and electrolyte water).

I don't expect it to get much worse than it is now, the benzos are a lifesaver in letting me sleep.

Some other veins, like on my bicep or crook of elbow, I'll get a trickle of blood, and decide I'm not in and pull out. Almost invariably, more blood will trickle out of the hole I just made in my arm. Does less blood just mean that the particular vein I'm in is under less pressure, but is just as sure of a shot?

It comes as chunks though and a point will last me 3-4 days(my tolerance stays in the zero to pretty low range, I always take twice as long off as I was on so as to try and stay safe). The variance in how long it last depends on how busy I am and if I'm partying with stims or working late or have a bunch of shit to do or whatever.

Anyways, the crux of my question - dealer/user etiquette. Is it ok to text your dealer? I've texted a few times asking to meet or asking for call backs, never sent anything incriminating but I've never got a text back. He has sent some texts to me before, one time with prices and once with directions. Also, is it ok to call a bunch of times relatively spaced out? Will that piss them off and make them ignore you or is it expected for users to fiend like that? What kind of hours do they usually work. I was in the coke game for a while years ago and I knew from 10pm to 5am I would be getting calls and they expect to be answered and you gotta meet them right now kinda thing. Is it the same for H guys? I called around 5pm today to set a meet for 1am and he said it'd be all good but I started calling around 11 and even by 2 hadn't heard back. Is it normal to set meets, or do H guys expect you to call and then meet ASAP. I Texted once and called twice between those times. Are these offenses? Are they severe enough to get you blacklisted on a phone? What's a normal pick up? When I sold weed I wouldn't meet for less than a quarter and got pretty choked when people tried to meet me for less, I wouldn't do it unless they paid extra or were a good friend or a well established regular who hit a rut. Usually I go buy a point or two maximum, is that a waste of time for the dealer? What's the usual minimum buy to establish yourself as a respectful customer worth the time to meet? Having sold a a few different things in the past I've noticed different drugs come with different etiquette and I'm wondering if I'm making my guy mad. He's a good link and also my only link so I don't want to fuck it up. Anyways any advice from ex-dealers or established users would be great. I have some friends who want me to buy for them and I promised I'd deliver(I don't profit, but my friends are scared of drug dealers) but now I'm worried I may have lost my link by doing something stupid. Should I just ask the guy next time I see him how he likes things done, provided I see him again?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

ps: at what volume should I start expecting a price cut? I'm paying 40/p right now and to me it's worth it to get what is in my novice opinion pretty solid #4. If I buy say half a gram should I expect my price to drop a bit? Is 40/p a fair price? Some people say it seems high but a point lasts me quite a while so it doesn't really bother me. Any advice/experience here would be great too.

For reference I live in Edmonton, so it's the last stop on the road for pretty much anything. Products are usually cut to shit and overpriced. Having a decent connect for good product is great I just don't really know much about this game so I don't know what's good and what's bad in terms of service/product or what the expectations are on the dealer and the customer.",1347270757.0

To fully understand the story, I have to take you back. Back a ways. I was 4. My mom would give me codiene cough syrup because I wasn't a very good sleeper. I remember loving the way it tasted, and that stuff tastes pretty terrible. After that, I had a fairly normal childhood, nothing too interesting went down. Through high school, I always found myself looking to change the way I felt. Drinking, smoking pot, taking some pills here and there, nothing too wild. When I was 17, I got my wisdom teeth taken out. I had a bad reaction, that resulted in a dreadful infection. I went to the doctor, and it was revealed that he used a latex sponge in my mouth(I am allergic). To avoid a lawsuit, and to keep my dad and I happy, he went a little nuts with his perscription pad(my dad is also an addict, and has been breaking himself off from all the pills I've gotten since I can remember). I remember realizing that I liked the way this medicine made me feel. A chill feeling. I could talk to anyone about anything, and have no fear. I used to say ""it makes me super honest"". This was the biggest misconception of my life. Opiates would make me a lot of things, but honest was not one of them. That summer, I also bit a hole through my lip and got in a car wreck, so I had a pretty constant string of opiates coming my way. It was a good summer. I started college the following fall, and without a source, I pretty much put the opiates down. I started dating a guy that I had liked since high school, and things were pretty great. I had an awesome boyfriend, I was loving school. We went to JazzFest, where I stupidly wore a sundress and no sunscreen. I got a horrible sunburn. I felt sick the day after, so I headed to my doctor to see if I could get some cream or something. She sent me home with a perscription for Lortab 5's. The sunburn healed in a week, and I had about 20 pills left over. This was the first time I remember taking opiates solely for the purpose of the way they made me feel. I knew what I was doing, but I figured that hey, I only take them at night, after school, while I'm waiting for my boyfriend to get home. And they DID come from a doctor, how dangerous could they be. I had my first ever blackout from that bottle. I locked my boyfriend out of the bedroom. I woke up the next morning with him asking me why, and I made some excuse. After that bottle ran out, I remember being pretty sad, but I wasn't fiending for more at that exact moment. Through the next few months, my relationship got rocky, he cheated, I forgave. I remember one night, he asked to go out to eat with his ex. I knew what was going to happen, but I didn't want to tell him no, I was terrified he might leave. So, I hit my toe with a hammer, hard, and went to a walk in clinic. 10 Lortab 10's. I was alright with him cheating on me that night. I had the ultimate boyfriend, and he was white and oblong. Over the next few months, things got worse. We fought, he called me lazy, stupid and worthless. But, shit, I didn't deserve any better. I always knew something was wrong with my nose. I had never been able to breathe properly. So, I marched myself to an ENT, got a CT and sure enough, my septum was deviated. Surgery was my best option. Well, hot damn, I was gonna have that!!! I knew I would get some fun drugs. I had that surgery, got about 60 10's, I knew it would last me a little while. It lasted me about a month, I was happy again. Comfort, solace, and happiness, all in these little bottles! Could it get any better? Even though my world was miserable, boyfriend that treated me terrible, full time job that was stressful and tiring PLUS school full time, I had happiness. I had a synthetic little version of heaven I could run to every night. The world could crumble, and I would sit in my bed and nod. I didn't care. Those pills eventually ran out, and I went back to life. This time, I couldn't take it. I was just miserable. One day at work, I decided that this shit needed to stop. I needed some pills. I didn't know any drug dealers, nor did I know how in the world one would become acquainted with one. So, I decided I needed to have surgery. There's something you need to know about me. I'm smart. Would I call myself a genius? No. But, I did my homework. I researched the shit out of appendicitis, and I DIDN'T just run to the emergency room. I called my GP's nurse, telling her I think I had some sort of stomach virus, that it hurt, bad, and that I was running a fever. She asked me to come in for a look see. I waited in that waiting room an HOUR after my appointment was supposed to be. When I was finally called back, I hobbled back there like I was dying. The doctor came in, and I knew when to flinch and what to say. She asked if I still had my appendix. I took a second to give a ""huh?"" look and said yes. She said ""I don't want you to panic, but I'm going to send you downstairs to see one of the surgeons."" ZING! I gave a panicked look and said, ""Okay, are you sure? Should I call my dad?"" She nodded yes and practically ran out of the room. I had her convinced. I knew my job wasn't over yet though. I still needed to convince a surgeon, and my dad. They wheeled me downstairs, and I called my dad. He hopped in the car and headed over. I went into the surgeon's office, he took a look asked me some questions. I knew what to say. He sent me to the hospital, for some fluids and tests. My heart sank. Tests. I knew very well that there was nothing wrong with me. What if I got found out? I was admitted to a room, and getting the IV was probably the worst part of it all. I had a nurse on each arm, tears running down my face. That is honestly the only time I can remember thinking ""Holy shit, Crystal, what the FUCK are you doing?"". They did an ultrasound on my belly and couldn't find anything, so the tech says, in front of both my dad and boyfriend ""It looks like we're going to have to do a transvaginal ultrasound."" She did that, and saw nothing. Shit. At about 9:30, the nurse came in and said, ""Well, surgery's at 10:30, he's taking out your appendix."" I was truly floored. I went in for surgery, and right as they were knocking me out I remember thinking, ""I hope this is all worth it."" When I woke up, my dad was being my dad and taking a nice little video. The next morning, I woke up from a nice morhpine induced sleep, and the nurse asked if I was in pain. I expected a percocet or something. I told her yes(duh, that was the reason I was there, MORE DRUGS). She brings in a syringe to put into my IV, I asked, ""Now what is this you're giving me?"" She said ""Morphine."" I said ""How long will it take to....oh my god."" I don't think I'll ever forget that high. My dad and I goofed around and talked. I was in bliss. The doctor came in to check on me and THIS is the kicker. He says, ""Well, you're appendix was definitely inflamed and needed to come out."" I nodded(haha pun) intently. We left the hospital that day, and get this, the doctor wrote me 60 Lortabs 10's and the pharmacy messed up and put a refill. I knew if they called him, he'd say no, so I filled them both so fast. This was the beginning of the end. Those 120 pills kept me good for about 2 months. After that, things went to shit pretty fast. But, that's for another day. In no way am I ever condoning what I did. What I did was dangerous, and I could have very easily died on that table. It is not something that I would reccomend to anyone. What I did was bad, and I feel bad. ",1347328268.0

I need your help...","I used to take one and a half Norcos daily for about three years almost every day. The 10/325 yellows or whites. 1.5. That's it. I used to take it at about 3PM when I started my shift at work. It would get me through the day and that was that. If I ever took more I would usually, not always, get a rebound headache,

I recently (February) took up a new assignment at work where I had to come in in the mornings three times a week. That's when I started dosing in the mornings. I soon realized that if I took more later in the day, I didn't get headaches anymore. That's when things got expensive. I slowly worked my way up to 6 a day and I do NOT allow myself more than that. I figured I'd at least keep it at a level that, though high, could be within the parameters of what would be prescribed. 

Now I'm hardly feeling anything on even six. I feel okay, sometimes pretty good, but that rush of warmth and joy has subsided. I do break it up over the day, two in the morning, two or three in the afternoon and a couple at night while I reddit or something. I'm worried that I'm well on the path to get worse and I want to stop before it gets too bad. I picked up some dillies and enjoy a couple 2mg sniffs (once or twice a day) just to supplement and avoid any more APAP. 

Here are some questions for you guys: 

At the amount I've been taking and used to take, do you think my liver would be alright? I used to worry about that a lot. I know it's not much but over a period of time I was just curious.

Would you consider my usage a heavy habit at all? I'm not trying to justify my use but I'm just trying to get an idea what you fellow Norco lovers take daily and how long it took you to get there just as a frame of reference.

Do you think a taper would be the best way to quit should I decide to do that? Would dillies help with tapering? I have about 25 left. I also have methadone 10mg four tablets which I'm saving for when I do decide to stop. I'm deathly afraid of methadone for some reason and never use it recreationally.

Fuck, how's life without opiates? It's always been a comforting blanket of warmth and I'm afraid of life still sucking if I'm sober. That's my ordeal, what if shit still sucks?

Here's some non related questions:

How important is it to be cryptic when texting about drugs, granted a cop doesn't ever take your phone from you or something?

I read some stories about people almost getting caught with shit. What's the penalty for possession? Prison, I'm guessing. Does it vary with how much you have on you? I sometimes secure deals where I'm rolling with 120 pills in an unlabeled rx bottle.

How much do 10/325s go for where you live?

Well thanks for reading. Looking forward to your responses. I just need some guidance, help, something. It's true what they say, guys. Money doesn't buy happiness, it buys pills. I'm 31 and make $50/hour. I sometimes feel embarrassed that I'm still doing this shit and spending so much money on it. Lately I've been spending close to  $500/month on getting high.

I'm just one of you. Looking for something, I dunno what, as we whirl through space. I really am glad there's a little corner of the interwebs where peeps like us can talk freely about this wonderfully sinister habit of ours. :)

EDIT: about nodding, I guess I've never got so high where I nod. Doesn't that kinda scare you guys? I mean isn't that just a step away from dying? How much Norco would you have to take to nod? Is it hard to OD if you judge it by stopping when you start nodding? Sorry, just never understood it. I'm no noob either. I shot H a few times like six years ago just always been curious about you nodders...

EDIT 2: about CWE, once you filter out APAP from the Norco, how do you know how much of the dissolved drug solution to take? Seems like it would be easy to OD and hard to dose properly, especially when dealing with 10/325s.

Maybe I can save this? Then I pour a bit of cold water in as well and it just starts bubbling. It's like something you would find in Yellowstone. These big fucking bubbles are erupting from the bottom of the coffee filter, just the blackest most goopy disgusting ooze you can imagine. And it's like 2 million degrees. A couple drips of _lava_ make it through the coffee filter, and the Chemex fills with smoke.

It is a Harm Reduction oriented post, with hopes of helping new and veteran addicts.

Here goes:

1. ***""Heroin is worth it only by IVing.""*** No. Just no. Shooting the dope has extra health risks that can be avoided. Abscesses, staph, decapitated limps, heart infections, broken veins, nerve damage, cotton fever, dirty hits, HIV, Hepatitis C. Apart from that, it lasts for less time, makes you WD more violently, leading to more money spending and a downward spiral.

2. ***""Once you IV, there is no coming back.""*** No. I know tons of addicts that either from health damages or a change in lifestyle, returned to snorting it. It took them a while, but they got used to it, and enjoy it, since it lasts longer. And if the quality is good, there is a rush, even though less pronounced.

3. ***""In smoking, after you take a hit, take immediately a nicotine hit from a cigarette""***. Bullshit. It is a combo of placebo effect and/or the rush of a big nicotine hit (these 2 substances are 'cousins')

4. ***""Weed always helps with Withdrawals"".*** This may be the case, but a lot of addicts use Opiates for psychological problems. So, when withdrawing, weed might create heavy anxiety, paranoia, and that may lead to a worse WD and/or scoring again so that the dreadful feeling goes away.

5. ***""When IVing, if you push the plunger quickly you will have a better rush""***. Maybe, but you can also have a blown up vein. Also, ""Rub the spot like there is no tomorrow"". This might create vein problems. Just push it gently. Finally, tourniquets might cause Thrombosis.

6. ***""If someone ODs, give him 4 aspirins - it will make his blood less thick"".*** lolwut

7. ***""You can get cotton fever by snorting also"".*** lolwut

8. ***""Buprenorphine is a miracle drug""***. Well, for some people it can work well. The ""some people"" factor does not make it a miracle. People have been addicted to Subutex, which has terrible, long lasting withdrawals. Apart from that, for some persons (myself  included) it creates a very weird feeling which you don't know if you are withdrawing or not, does NOT eliminate all the WD symptoms, and finally is kinda stimulating in a weird fashion, which for persons with GAD, Bipolar Disorder and other issues, makes them manic and paranoid.

9. ***""Crystal Meth helps with Opiate Withdrawals""***. I personally witnessed the 80% of Heroin addicts (most of them functional) to become slowly Meth addicts, and deteriorate in 3 months. The most dangerous myth that I have ever seen being taken seriously by some...

Originally from Marx and pulled from a longer statement about the role of religion in a society that is less than ideal, the parallels between opiates and religious beliefs are endless and profound.

As someone who was once very familiar with the daily use of opiates, I will stick to what I know and you can make your own inferences.

Everyone knows that opiates are administered to dull pain, and everyone knows that they are addictive. While opiates can make you more comfortable, they don't help to heal the source of your discomfort, they make you care less that it hurts. 

Unfortunately opiates don't just dull pain, they dull pleasure too. It is virtually impossible to orgasm while high on opiates. In the same way that they effect your sense of touch (physical feeling) they affect your emotions (mental feelings.) Opiates take the anger(pain) out of hate and the joy(pleasure) out of love; they take the shame out of remorse and the pride out of accomplishment. They put a ""but whatever"" at the end of every ""I feel""

Your body has natural painkillers (endorphins,) and when you take opiates, your body stops producing them. The longer that you stay on opiates, the weaker your natural system gets. This is what perpetuates their use and fuels addiction; if you stop taking them it hurts until your natural system regains its strength.

A life on opiates is never great and never awful, it's a life in which you don't really care because you don't really feel.",1347802590.0

100nd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/100nd6/no_mas_nod/,10,https://redd.it/100nd6,SmackNoob,No mas nod,"So, I've streched my last few buns for a few days. Tomorrow is my first clean day. I have a sub appointment, and I am really ready and willing to give sobriety my damndest try.

Here's the problem: one of the reasons I ""relapsed"", or perhaps more accurately, didn't stick with my original clean date, ( I was supposed to quit last Sunday, but just had to go out and pick up one more stack-got a really good deal from my guy for bringing him a few new clients)  was because I really wanted to catch one more nod. When I first started, I could nod off of 1/2 a bag insufflaed of decent #4. 

When I say nod, I mean that state between consciousness and dreaming, where you are awake but it feels like there is someone in the room with you-y'all know what I'm talking about. In the past 2 years, I have lost 3 people very dear to me: 2 from car accidents, one from cancer that went undaignosed until she was in stage 4. When I would nod, they would often ""be in the room with me,"" and they would tell me how awesome heaven was, and how they just played pool with Minnesota Fats, or just finished giving Marilyn Monroe a creampie..stuff like that.  I would laugh and reminisce with them -it was by far  favorite part of getting high.

I simply can not get to that stage anymore. I still get the rush, I still feel great, everything else is still there-but no matter how much I take, no matter how high I get-the nod is gone.  I've tried doing 4 bag shots (1.5 is my norm), and I just fall asleep. I've tried popping a few bennadryls,  a couple of valium-whatever. No nod. I go from really high but coherent, to asleep.

Is this common? I'm not chasing the rush-the rush is still there. I just want to nod out one more time. I have 2 bags left, which I'm saving for when I wake up tomorrow. Does anyone have any advice on how to bring the nod on?

Thanks

P.S.-after these bags are gone, I'm gonna start hanging out over in /r/OpiatesRecovery . I have a feeling the pill/stamp porn will be too much of a ""trigger.""

I was looking for some feedback on my experience and help me figure out if I got some shitty dope or I just can't handle heroin. Was going to post to r/druga but I fancies some 'professional"" advice :) Anyway, I smoked some of my friends heroin about 4 years ago and since then tried it only 3 more times because I didn't actually think it was that good. Now two weeks ago I was thinking what substance to take with me on a long coach journey and I thought that heroin might be good as I could get sleepy and catch a bit of a buzz at the same time, so I went ahead and ordered some well respected #4 from a good contact. So Saturday comes and I'm sat there with my snorting kit, 0.001 scales and 0.5 of some very sexy #4. I measure out a nice starting line of 10mg and hit it. I swear within 10 minutes I could feel something and in 45 minutes I was soaring but nodded out and fell asleep after I had passed the hour mark. I awoke several hours later and was gutted I fell asleep so I lined up a 15mg, hit it and was sleeping like a baby again in about 20 minutes. This time though I woke in an hour and needed a tea but while making it I puked up in my sink and felt really weak. I sat down again and fell asleep again for a few hours. Woke up and felt fine but the second I stood up I had the urge to vomit again and did. This pattern of snort(10mg & 15mg), sleep and puke happened another two times. Now it's Monday morning and I can't keep any food or drink down and I didn't even catch a decent buzz. Is the dope shit or did I just do too much? I had every intention of IV'ing this stuff but after such a crap time I've shelved that idea for now and now am thinking I have wasted my money. Thoughts?",1347866972.0

I never used to i.v, but now I do. For the past three months or so I have been almost daily (few exceptions where I went a week or two, or just didn't dose up for a day) i.v'ing either: heroin (shitty quality), oxycodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone, and morphine. I've been pretty good about not letting my tolerance jump too high, slammed a A215 the other night and got a decent buzz from it, kinda when i decided i need to stop or I may let it get too high. Any meds I get I try not to slam the entire thing or more than one. Always quarters or halfs. Last thing, only a few days out of these past months have I shot up more than once in a day and has always been during the night usually before bed. Will I experience withdrawal again? I understand everyone is different and that that answer will vary, but in general does it seem that I will? And will it be greater since I have been i.v'ing? Thanks for any help.

Woke up around 7:15. Made some coffee and breakfast for my girlfriend. While she munched I proceeded to snort 3 and a half 30's over the course of 45 minutes. For some of you this would be absolute madness, for others, it would be a walk in the park. For me it was somewhere in between. As some of you may remember I had 4 so I had another half just in case I wasn't feeling it. Definitely didn't need it. We left around 9, got there at 10:30. Not a ton of people but there was a crowd. First thing we did was get on the superman. Waited no more than 10 minutes and it was pretty good. Not feeling the full effects but I had a little warm noddy moment waiting to blast off superman style. 

It finally all hit me when I was standing in line for the green lantern. The park had filled up a bit while waiting for superman and we had a little more of a wait time. nothing crazy, 30-40 minutes tops. I REALLY enjoyed this ride. I was nodding in line, getting a little agitated at the people in front of me not paying attention a couple of times and making jokes with the lady when we finally got on. Despite the fucking plastic crotch guard that pinched my massive balls, I was in pure bliss during the ride. So much so that I didn't get off the ride right away and closed my eyes to enjoy just a few more seconds of euphoria. Walking through the park, enjoying my high and my girlfriends presence and I couldn't be happier. I've been battling minor (i hope) depression with the last month and this was exactly what I needed. I almost cried tears of joy.

I've spent the last hour online purchasing a 100 ct. box of rigs, a filtering syringe with wheel filters, bacteriostatic water, alcohol wipes, medical use torniquets, and other miscellaneous tools in the interest of harm reduction.  I'm a rather intelligent person, yet I completely ignored the risks involved in shooting up until recently.  One of my less-than-shining moments involved shooting up in my car; my husband (also a user) and I parked at the far corner of a Food Lion parking lot and began to prepare our shots.  We realized the only filtering implement we had left was a q-tip that had been used in my ear.  We were shooting up blues, and this particular brand (can't remember which brand exactly) left quite a bit of residue on the spoon--it also had a tendency to gel up.  I decided that it would be more risky to not use a filter than to use the one that had been in my ear canal; it was not the most health-concious choice, but I was really sick--I needed that shot.  So, I used the nasty cotton, and I (thankfully) did not suffer any ill effects.  Other times, I've resorted to using cigarette filters and toilet paper.  After shooting up suboxone on a daily basis, I fucked up my veins and reduced their flow to a slow, dark trickle.  I finally realized I needed to be as safe as possible from that moment.  My arms have healed, and I'm no longer shooting my subs--I'm saving my veins for the good stuff, which I will properly filter and inject (no more re-using old rigs either).  I was just wondering if you guys had any similiar horror stories?  What's the riskiest thing you've done when you were injecting or snorting drugs?

This last binge only was like two weeks, but still I know that I won't be feeling to great in the days to come if I don't take something.

I don't think 30mg will suppress respiration, but not 100% sure on that either? Is hydration a problem? if I encounter any nausea, is it a good idea to smoke a little marijuana? I've gotten mixed responses on that, but a slight majority said the weed would be just perfect for getting rid of the upset stomach. Any other advice is welcome, thank you guys again.",1348149071.0

  I've had chronic daily migraines for the past 4 1/2 years. I'm not able to tolerate triptans, so my family doctor prescribed me Oxycodone to alleviate the pain. By June of this year, I was being prescribed 20mg Oxycodone 3x a day. 

At the end of June I went to the doctor's office to pick up my script and it was only for a 10 day supply. The lady who handed me my prescription told me that all of the doctors had to go to a 5 hour meeting the day before and were told they had to stop writing prescriptions for schedule I and II substances for all of their patients. I was given a 10 day supply and sent on my way. 

The next day I started calling my Dr's office leaving messages for my Dr asking how to wean myself off of the medicine. After leaving daily messages, the day I ran out of the meds, the receptionist called my doc at home and his response was just to drink lots of water and go to the ER if necessary. 

The next day, a doc from another practice talked me into going to a rehab facility to be detoxed. She was afraid I would go into seizures since I'd been on oxy for so long. 

I was put on Subs 2mg, taken once a day for 6 weeks until I ran out. I ended up going off cold turkey almost 6 weeks ago and I still feel horrible! I'm still sneezing all the time and waking up early. The worst part by far, though, is the anxiety, racing heart, and tremors. Is it normal to still be going through this? I've been to the ER twice. The last time was 2 weeks ago and they told me I should be finished with the withdrawals by now. 

If only I knew then what I knew now, I never would have taken percocet on a daily basis. I'd never even heard of withdrawals when the doctor started prescribing them to me >.<",1348182732.0

Here lately, I've noticed Pharms and Pain pills getting shouts out across the hip hop world. SLowly sneaking there way into acceptance among the rap community. It all started with Lean. That made it cool to do pharmaceuticals and shit other than weed and since you drank it, it didn't have the stigma that snorting a pill or popping them have. Then came X. [Gucci Manes Pillz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp5_EStUth0) made it blatantly obvious he likes to roll and that it's no longer taboo to pop a pill as long as your in the club. This has also lead to the popularization of [MOLLY](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSl2ezoyPuo) being shouted out in EVERY rap song on the radio in the last year as well.

Also, will this high make me nod? Or if I nod, have I consumed too much? I'm very nervous when I use these, as they are very dangerous. Anyone who tries fent, please be very safe!

Thank you in advance, and have a good night all!",1348628363.0

Next thing I know, I'm waking up in a complete daze with two cops above me shining flashlights in my face and asking me a ton of questions. Apparently after I took the pills, I laid back down and nodded off, about an hour later my girlfriend heard me struggling to breathe and making crazy noises in my sleep, and could not for the life of her wake me up. She called 911 after about 15 min of trying to wake me up (she had no idea I had taken the pills), and I finally woke up RIGHT as the cops were walking up the steps. I definitely overdosed and am SO lucky that I woke up and was okay after a trip to the hospital. Please, take my story as an example to be careful when using potentiaters (I didn't even intend to use the bendaryl as a potentiater), and do NOT take your normal dose, or at least be very mindful of your dose if you are using them.

I live in a clean cut suburban community where the only drug you can consistantly obtain is weed. None of my friends know of my H endeavors nor will they ever. They, like my self, keep drug use to a minimum.  We smoke weed three or four times a week and drink on weekends, that's about it.

That being said, about once a month, sometimes twice, I'll pick up two stamps off the road and have myself a nice two nights in the middle of the week. I usually end up doing half a point around 8 o'clock while I read (which is fucking heaven!).  Then I take another half around 9 and I'm full on nodding, usually end up falling asleep with the book on my lap.  The next morning when I wake up for work early I always feel amazingly well rested. 

I feel if I had an IRL dealer I would be fucked. It'd be too tempting. Luckily the silk road is such a process I don't end up buying another bag for several weeks when I ""get that urge"".

Any suggestions please?,"Sorry for the wall of text, but there is a **TL;DR**. I **very much need your help bropiates**, because this will happen again.

So I'm in a situation where I have just about nothing until tomorrow afternoon. I've been going through withdrawals every afternoon and night since Tuesday (I have a person who lives with me who gives me a teeny tiny maintenance dose in the morning, which I appreciate, but it doesn't last past about noon). Anyway, this kind of thing doesn't happen every week, or every day at all -- I'm usually able to manage.

Sometimes, I'm not able to manage. Due to nothing being around to buy sometimes, but sometimes it's money. I am a... computer professional to put it broadly (**Edit**: it seems I have to clarify: I do code, lots of it.) A functional addict with severe back pain due to injury.

However -- about twice a month, I am going through WD's pretty harsh for at least 48 ~ 72 hours. My saving grace of a few hours is the maintenance dose, but it isn't enough -- but I'm not going to force her to give me her meds or steal from her.

What I want to know is... how do you guys deal with short-term withdrawal? It's hell. The initial shit with the diarrhea, kicking, cold-sweats, muscle cramps, headache, watery eyes, runny nose, bad mood and just *general shittiness*. ...I know it's gonna be bad when I all of a sudden get *really freakin tired* and sleep for six hours in a sick, dead stupor... I know when I wake up from *that*, that it's gonna be hard and I'll be wide awake, because after that bout of sleepiness during the onset of withdrawal -- I can't sleep at all after that. I'll be on the toilet for hours. Does anyone have an emergency mode that could help me?

Also though -- my pain gets so much worse! I have a serious condition in my lower lumbar spine based on an injury ten years ago, so there's also that to contend with.

Currently, I have in my possession: immodium (*life saver there*), Soma (carisoprodol), Ritalin, weed, benadryl and a few beers. I have been partaking of all these tonight except for weed and benadryl, but don't worry -- I'm smart enough to know about interactions and to do this in moderation. In moderation is also how I take my pain meds, but as I've had to take them for 10 years because of a back injury... when I don't have it, I *feel it big time*.

**Possible Tip for Others**: Tramadol, when taken after 24 hours after your last dose of an opioid painkiller, can slightly reduce the withdrawal symptoms. I've noticed this... however I have to take ~7 to make this work. It makes me feel kinda ""eeeeh"", but it's one HELL of a lot better than pure withdrawal. Usually I'll take 7 Tramadol, 4 Immodium and a half of a benadryl and I'll be out for at least a few hours.

If anyone could help me, I know that I will not be able to ignore this or ""band-aid it"", but at least if it could be made slightly more bearable somehow? I've been taking in a lot of electrolytes and water, because the diarrhea dehydrates you, I've taken some soma, and had two (doctor prescribed) ritalin -- which helps me focus on other things *but* keeps me up, 3 beers and a total of 10 immodium (10 immodium taken over the course of 15 hours) but still have diarrhea (but less than if I had taken no immodium).

If it may matter at all: I am female.

I have a career and life to take care of -- but also insurmountable back pain, but I have to go through this fucked up shit and try to manage, and it's hard. If only I never fell off that roof! Maybe then I wouldn't know what opiate dependance was. :/

**TL;DR**: About twice a month I go through serious, but short-term withdrawals. What are some of the things you do to manage in a situation like this?

I got an OK from the moderators for this and hope not too many people are put off by my discussion of specific vendors on the road.

So, I had been wanting to do the big H for many years now but had never been in a position to convince people that could obtain it for me.  I have had a long history of addictive behavior with most of my adult live spent going very heavily with our friend alcohol.  Anyone who knew anybody ""knew better"" than to help me connect with people that could obtain our friend the big H.

For many years I had replaced alcohol with Poppy Pods.  From eBay to private sellers until the arizona raid a couple of years ago I was very well situated with a 10 pod a day habit that let me tame the beast I had unleashed with alcohol.  I moved onto PST (poppy seed tea) when the price of pods became prohibitively expensive ($10/pod) and have since been more than a little curious about other options for my daily dose of dopamine manipulators.

After following BitCoin through the $30 bubble and checking out SilkRoad a couple of times a few months passed and I decided that there most be some kind of non-scamy activity happening. Otherwise there would not be so much press surronding the road, random people speaking of it, etc, etc.

So I took my time researching the current vendors on the road focusing most of my efforts on the several hundred pages of the Herion thread(s) on the silkroad forums.  NoGenRX seemed to be the practical choice with grams of suppoedly excellent #4 heroin in the $250 a gram range.  After recieving this first order and sampling H I knew it was a turning point and my life would enter a honeymoon phase with the drug that continues to this day.

I've now sampled 3 vendors from the silkroad which I can recommend and would like to state that it is indeed a fine place to get what you need in times of need.  You must do thorough research on the forums and stick to the rules of using the escrow system and not being the first person to try out a new vendor if you hope to get what you are paying for.

Now for the vendors:

**NoGenRX**

NoGen has #4 heroin from Canada and recently has been going through some problems in keeping up with demand.  Here is what his heroin looks like:

http://s16.postimage.org/aqtdidgk5/nogen5.jpg


**Nod**

Nod perhaps has the best service that I've seen on the Road.  He is a friendly guy and very professional. He sells black tar heroin from the U.S. and can ship overnight.  He has reliably had listings to purchase for several weeks now and reliably sends things out overnight.  The price for his tar is perhaps something that may astonish folks around here @ $300/gram but the quality is IMO up near the level of NoGen's #4. My picture sort of sucks for Nod's tar but here it is anyways:


http://s7.postimage.org/ngbnc5cu3/nod.jpg

**PeoplesDrugStore**

PeoplesDrugStore is somewhat of a newcomer on the scene, offering #4 from canada like NoGenRX and a couple of other popular vendors ( TomorrowMan and NorthernDancer as well as the famed ""Opi"" ).  I went out of escrow for this order, but would not recommend anyone else do the same. Prices are similar for this #4 at $250/gram. Heres a couple of pictures I just took:

I hadn't seen a direct discussion here regarding vendors on the road and thought it would benefit those who have thought of looking into it but have not because of lack of easily accessible information.  I think (personally) that not dealing with real life dealers of hard drugs may be worth the premium that is being charged on the road.  There is still obviously legal risk but at least the possibility of getting ensnared in some dealer's legal or personal or financial drama is lessened by having that dealer seperated by several hundred or thousand miles.",1348875537.0

I'm pretty new here but I've been experiencing some weird effects with my opiate use.

On average a roxy 30 or an opana ten every day or so with the occasional morphine or dilaudid. I discovered poppy seed tea and tried it whenever he was dry for a few days, and eventually got it to work. I never want to do pod tea because a friend of mine made me swear to stay away from them because of the hellish w/ds and overdose he got from his pod habit. I went back to school, where i dont have any reliable connects for pills, so switched to PST full time, doing about a pound everyday. Other than the bad w/ds i got when i dried out for a weekend, i've actually really liked the morphine/codeine combination of PST as well as all the other alkaloids. But it's made my tolerance SKYROCKET. I don't even get that high off of PST, but I don't even feel a roxy 30 or six vic 7.5s anymore.

Due to this the way I both metabolise medications, and the length of time medications stay in my system is different than most people. I'm prescribed hydromorphone  ( Dilauded) contin 3 mg  6X per day and plain old hydromorphone ( also dilauded)  immediate release 2mg also 6X per day . I have a really good relationship with my doc, but I've only been seeing her for a year or so., and I know she has a lot of trouble with her opiate patients , and I don't want to be one of them. The issue is right now two fold. The first is that my tolerance has grown. I've been taking them for about six months, and I don't know if it's an appropriate discussion to have. The second is that because of the way my intestines are routed. I don't hold onto the contin drugs for as long as I shoukd be. Contin are supposed to be long lasting , that means I shoukd be getting at least 4-6 hours of effect on each dose , which I'm just not getting. This means I'm over relying in the breakthrough meds, and I'm doing various things with the contin, like crushing them in my teeth and washing them down with grapefruit juice to at least get a fuller effect, because just taking them normally, doesn't seem to do that much right now . I'm also thinking of bringing up the idea of her perscribing the hydromorphone contin in a suppository ( if that's possible) to increase the bioavailability and help the absorption . I'm wondering if anyone had had any good or bad stories experiences with narcotics via suppository. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I crushed up some of my normal 2mg tablets in a mortar and pestle on two occasions and mixed them with water and put them up my ass with an oral syringe and it worked *very well* . So obviously I don't want to do that on a continuing basis, as no pun intended its a pain in the ass, and if I can do it, I want to take my medicine in the way its psrscibed since I do have a doctor willing to work with me. I have a history of drug abuse in my past, so she has to be careful around me, but she also does want to help with my pain, so as long as I do t show obvious signs of becoming a junky and or highly addicted, she's going to be willing to help me. I'm wondering if the discussion I want to have about tolerance, or the suppository use might be seen as a trigger and make her wary. Any input?

IVing 16mg of dilaudid puts me in a nice place, and usually I end up doing up to 5 (40mg) in a day.

I would be splitting the G with girl, who has equal tolerance. So essentially I would have 500mg for myself.

I've read the average shot for a tolerant user is 50mg. Which would net myself 10 shots.  

Is the 500mg enough to keep myself high for a day? I know this is tough to answer due to quality of the H, but let's assume it is of a high grade.

It would cost me about 150$ for the 500mg, where if I spent that in pills I could almost get high for 2 days. I don't mind only getting a days worth out of the H, but I don't want to spend 150$ to only get a few shots, and high for a couple hours ...

I re-started that similar use habit (couple points a week) for the last month, but for the past two weeks I have used maybe 3 points everyday. Yesterday was my first totally sober day since my regular use, and I had some pretty light aches, and insomnia - but that was about it.

I went and bought one more bundle today, but I want it to be the last for good.

I am also writing this on Reddit so I can hold myself a bit more accountable, and find a group of people to help me on (I keep my bad habits a total secret).

So, any advice to offer?  Should I ween off with this last bundle (maybe 1 point a day, then 0.5 a day) until I run out? Or would it be better to just finish it off/get rid of it and go cold turkey?

I've already deleted all of my contacts' numbers, and I've got the luxury of not knowing where any of my guys live. I'm also not the type to ask somebody random on the street.

I want to ensure that this brief stint of regular use is indeed temporary before I need to consider that I might have an addiction.  I have been using primarily to spice up my day/enjoy the high - and have yet needed to use just to ""feel better"".

With most opiates (especially at a low amount like this) it wouldn't be much of a problem, but I'm under the impression that the half-life is exceptionally long, which might cause me to fail it. I'm going to attempt to reschedule it for 1-2 days later, which I have a decent chance of being able to do, but might not.

So with that considered, what are my chances of passing/failing the drug test? I've attempted to flush weed out of my system for a drug test in the past, but that's usually over a much longer period of time than 72 hours, so is there anything I can do to assist its passing/masking over the period of time given, other than drinking water leading up to the drug test along with B vitamins and Niacin?

As far as I know 5 mg is a (relatively) minimal amount, how much will that improve the situation? This is the third time I've taken it in about a week, the last time being Wednesday, and both of the other times I consumed 5 mg also, how will that affect it?

Lastly, will it even show up on the drug test? I'm not sure how standardized DoC testing is, although I'd imagine it would be mostly similar, if not exactly the same, in a different state. Although I'm not quite sure what the different testing elements are, if I recall correctly 2 of the 5-7 types are for Opiates, it might be Heroin and Oxys/Hydros/other opiates? It seems from researching this that Methadone probably won't show up on anything but a specific test for it, are my facts inaccurate? My PO will throw away the testing kit after the quick test is finished, and only sends it into the lab for testing if I come up positive (or possibly if it's inconclusive).",1349573312.0

1129zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1129zo/from_chipping_for_6_years_to_shooting_up_for_a/,34,https://redd.it/1129zo,halfwayjux,From chipping for 6 years to shooting up for a month straight... (long story long),"So I started doing opiates at 15, 15mg roxis and 2mg dilaudids of which one would make me feel divine. After the most taken route of weed > crazy shit > opiates. I was fortunate to be the last of my group of friends to start doing them, and saw many of them become addicted so I learned to never do them more than a day and a morning straight, no matter what, pill or powder. Although pills were fucking skittles, bullshit, compared to what heroin did to me and gave me an additional ""soul"" high. After that opiates were on my mind daily, and I started doing them weekly, bi-weekly, then a long long weekend straight. And so I stopped. For a while.

After a great number of months I thought it was possible to chip as I had before, doing them monthly or less, and I pulled it off, until last summer when I first shot dope and sniffed it before that a few days a week, enough that I had to feel like a schmuck taking piggybanks to the closest coinstar that I hadn't cashed out already. Spending money that I shouldn't have, and so it goes. So I stopped...

And then, I started dabbling in pills again, because pills I'll never have a problem with, only heroin is my downfall, well and maybe really good hard while on it, but that's not even that bad. So I did the pills on occasion and got away with it.

Beginning of Summer was the honeymoon. I got bags every now and then, blew a couple, got retarded, balls were itching and I had no problem scratching them violently in public, in front of who gives a flying fuck. Nod, nod, nod. Don't come home, sleep wherever, it's not REM sleep anyway. Do it a few days in a row and get those false visions of exhaustion...

Silk Road FUCKED it up. One of my best friends made an account and soon began receiving quarter, half, and full grams of #3 and #4 heroin at purity of around 90+ percent. I began going upstate to see him weekly, and only smoking or snorting this gorgeous shit that had to have been skimped off bricks in Afghanistan or some shit, I don't know how else it would've been available. And so began my decline into addiction, low to moderate by my standards. Because it started costing too much for skimped street bags that we ended up settling for, I started to shoot it up. And after the second, third, fourth and fifth shot, it didn't stop. So I did it for five days straight, didn't get sick. Didn't ever get sick for six years.

Since the beginning of September, up to four days ago, I had syringes in my arms for all but one day of that month. Found homeless junkies in the village who I bought a bag for buying me bags and one of them left their dealer's number in my phone. The end. Sixty dollar bundles of decent Arizona became $80 bundles of the infamous Purple Label that did me so good for a while. Well, anyway, it was a few bags over a day, and it led up to sometimes booting shit buns in a night, smoking hard on top. No money for crack after that, since only heroin could consume me as it did. Better than sex? Pfff. Sex is for idiots who don't know what ""orgasmic"" really feels like. I started loving the bathrooms of White Castle who didn't even care if I bought anything to use them and doing it there every day, sometimes a few a day.

Two thirds into the month-long binge I started to feel that it wasn't fun anymore. I anxiously waited for my dealers who came soon enough, but I started worrying about being sick in jail, if I got caught, and since I'm already on probation for a couple more years, hopefully only one more, that it'd be even worse. So I decided I had to stop, after ripping great friends off and encouraging them to cop saying that I was getting ten bucks off, ha ha! More like charging you enough so that my bundle or so became free. Scumbag? Oh yeah! Like I gave a shit then. Then there was no more money that wasn't mine to spend anyway on it, and my insulin syringes were dull after the unknown number of bruises and sometimes I found to my horror that that bruise on my forearm WAS NOT FUCKING COOL and WAAAY too fucking big for normalcy. Okay, relax. One more day. Yeah, tomorrow will be it. For a week or so...

Run out of funds and so I get a few subs spotted from the friend I ripped off, guilt-free. Asshole! The first day of sobriety was the worst, having shot up a dose that didn't even get me right, just content until I started not being able to get comfortable and aching, cold, hot, both at the same time! Online it said to give it 12-24 until dosing on subs. Well, I only did after 36 hours, and only because I had restless leg and trouble sleeping. One milligram worked. After that, I never really felt sick, even though I shot decent to good dope for a month straight, and heard of people doing small amounts of opiates for a week and crying, shitting and puking. What the fuck? Am I immune? Clearly not, since I felt some withdrawal symptoms, but I'm still wondering why they were so minute? The urge to cop was only there the first sober day.

I know I can't responsibly use opiates anymore, even if I won't be a junkie telemarketer... I know that it'll only be heroin, and only intravenous, because I soon became addicted to the needle. Oh, they didn't lie. I used to dread shots, and now I can't wait for the next one. Drug dealers became my best friends and public bathrooms my favorite place to be. Real friends told me to chill and hit them up when I wasn't being rude - was I? Who cared?

My only regret is ripping off those who didn't deserve it, and never shooting the Silk Road dope. I probably would've died with my amateur tolerance. It was hard to do dope when it was a lot of money, but it really fucked up when it became $60 a bundle and direct, in less than five minutes of wait. Well, now, as opposed to before, I actually want to stop doing it all, bad drugs, weed, ""good"" drugs, except acid, I need that one more time. I'd like to thank dope for somehow making me forget about my depression and self-loathing, which I had harbored before, it only took regularity to open my eyes to the problem that is I.

In closing, I'm sorry, as a writer I haven't written anything in over a month worth of value, who would want to do anything productive anyway right? So I apologize for any scrambled thoughts or typos, and I know I got lucky, and I don't need to test it anymore. I've done enough, and only have 4-ACO-DMT, 2-CI and LSD to recommend to those who wouldn't take advantage or abuse them.

By god though, casual chippers are strong mental motherfuckers, and I was one for long enough. Now comes all the shit I neglected and procrastinated, writing, music and other arts, the endless conquest for all possible retained knowledge and a never-ending progression. Maybe some day I'll be back, but you best believe it'd be Silk Road quality to start. By the way, that site is the future of the drug market and my friend is making enough off of it to take away more of his soul as a result. Our friends died from this, and well, someone's gonna make the buck, it might as well be they who ran in the same circle.

Sorry about the novella, have a wonderful and responsible existence and feel free to dole out all comments, questions and criticism. Peace gods!

I, on the other hand, have a type of chronic pain that my pain doctor said is only surpassed by bone cancer (thus my throwaway account name).  I am in misery without narcotic painkillers.  I literally cannot function.  And it is not because I am addicted to painkillers.  I just started.  What's particularly shitty is that I went through months of intense, debilitating pain because of all of the legal hurdles involved with getting opiate painkillers.  So I feel justifiably bitter towards those of you are are abusing painkillers just for the fun of it.  It makes it hard for people who suffer with brain injuries, cancer, etc. to get them.

Again, I might be interpreting things wrong, but it seems like just about everyone here is taking opiates for recreational purposes.  If that is the case, think about who you are harming (besides yourselves) when you abuse them.  Yes, I think drug laws should be more lenient.  But they aren't.

I've lost a good deal of stomach and intestine, so wasn't absorbing the contin 

I asked doc about moving me to the suppository firm of dilauded, only to find out, it's not available in my country.. We discussed possibly moving to morphine in suppository format , but what the doc wants to do first. In regard to a discussion I had about my tolerance to the contin, was to shift me over to morphine ER.


Due to my success in plugging ( keestering.. Whatever) I'm now openly asking you guys  if its possible to plug those morphine ER tablets? I never tried to plug the contin capsules before, because i was unsure if they would release in that erm.. Area and I wasn't sure if it would hurt me.. And I'm not looking to be one of those people who shows up in the ER and has to be treated as a result of shoving anything up his ass... Ever. It's just a slice of reality I was hoping I could avoid.  I'm ok with lots of things that other people would not be ok with. But that's just one story I don't want to tell the grand kids . plus it would get back to my doctor, and that conversation would go badly, and it would go on my permanent medical record here , and no one would ever give me drugs again.. 

Yet, the plugging works so well fucking well, but it makes me hella dope sick in the AM and brings my tolerance up.. I cannot inject thus, or any of the drugs I get, I can't sniff because every doctor whose looked in my nose for the last 25 years has commented on how much damage has been done to it, one person said my sinuses are held together with snot basically .. I'm married, work a 9-5 , have kids. It's just that any pain med I take stops working after I take it for four or five months. I need to work with what I have. I'm trying the morphine for two weeks.

My doc isn't going to put me in Oxy, because 85% of her practice are people who are drug seekers, or who have since become drug seekers, and so far, she isn't scared of me. But she knows I used to sniff dope back in the day, and she's nervous about me, but she's trying to help. So if I suddenly ask her to shift me to Oxy anything, it's going to set off bells.

So bluntly, I guess I'm asking  if anyone has any advice in plugging the morphine ER, I'm seeing very unclear information about if the ER part of the formulary will release in my ass, and again, there is is also the hypothetical  hospital visit due to shoving something up my ass scenario, that I really want to avoid.

Google has returned varied results so I'm still not sure.

Between Oxy and Kratom, I've done SOMETHING every day for the last 12-18 months.
I've kept my dose under 30mg of oxy a day. 1 (15 most days) and kratom on days between.

A totally minor habit to many, but a habit none the less.

I'm on day three clean so far, I've had a bit of restlessness and had took a temazepam for sleep last night. This plus a bit of anxiety, some sneezing, and the cravings of course has been my only issues so far.

My question is, after 3 days is this pretty much the worst of it? (meaning I only have a minor physical addiction) or it just the beginning?

I brought some gear up on the plane but getting drunk at after-show parties brought on the stupidity and I used the lot with two days and a gig still to go.

First day I tried to score I was ripped. Now, I've been doing this for 18 years, I know when people are being dodgy. Alas, desperation got the better of me and I threw caution somewhat to the wind.

Tried again the next day and the girl was clearly planning to rip me off. She wouldn't let me see it and I said, ""Don't worry about it then'"". The solution - they have a safe injecting room in the area. She would go in with me so I could have my shot right there with her before paying and if it wasn't real I'd lost nothing. Lucky for that option because after refusing to show me the deal, she then went and scored again - obviously this time the real thing.

Now, I realise that without a shitload of paperwork such a place could not exist, but can you imagine being 2 days into withdrawal, not even sure if you're getting the genuine product, and having to sit through 15min of questioning to register to use the room. It was driving me crazy! Then you have to wait anywhere from 5-25min for a booth to become available.Before this room existed there were overdoses so constant the ambos could barely keep up. People were openly shooting up right there on the footpath of the main road. It took a long time to get the place going - the community, the cops and the pollies were dead against it.

Never thought I was one to be the center of an intervention. 

I was smarter. I was stronger. I was better prepared. 
But Heroin knows that. It feeds into your psych. Most of us are above average intelligence, and we only need our wits to get by in life. We never have to study, or work hard. We simply solve everything with our intellect- lying, cheating, conning, slipping by unnoticed. Then we became addicts, and we couldn't beat it. We'd never lost to anything before, how could this happen? 
It happened because addiction is a part of ourselves. We finally had a formidable foe; ourselves. We rationalize and try to make sense of the losing battle, but we can't beat addiction. We can't beat addiction because it is in us as much as our heart or brain or kidneys are in us.

Once you're an addict you don't go back. You can be sober for 25 years but you're still an addict.**You fight every day to stay clean.**

If anyone has a personal story of beating a real hardcore addiction and staying clean for the rest of their life, please share, it would surely provide solace to at least one of us.

It's crazy. I've had nightmares about this happening, and I knew I shouldn't have even been doing it here. I just thought I could get away with it every once and awhile. I thought I hid it pretty well, but I swear my mom is a fucking magnet to find my shit. When she called me when I was out, I knew exactly what it was for. I was terrified. I was able to play stupid and act like it wasn't mine, and the story was good. And the cries over the phone and to hear her ask me if I ""do heroin"" will forever ring in my head. Pretty sure she still has her suspicions. Especially for why I would hang out with people who touch that stuff. 

While I was out, all I could think about was the other piece of foil that had some left on it, and how I didn't have an excuse for that if she found it. Or the tooter in the bathroom mirror case. Or the tooter in the pants I wore the day before! I was freaking out......That whole time driving home, the whole 5 minutes, all I could think about was her not finding it and how I would never do it again to prevent her from believing that her son she invested so much into would do such a thing. I got home and thankfully everything was clear. But I had to wait for her to leave before I could do anything about it. At the time all I could think about was smoking it all one last time. Getting that one last high. As soon as she left I slapped myself and threw it all away. For good.

My girlfriend was with me at the time of the call and I told her the same lie, but she later brought it back up claiming she knew what was up. I've been doing tar for 4 years, and opiates for a couple more, and I think it's officially time to stop. I can't have this be a part of my life forever. The high is great. I didn't even do it at a serious level (or so I think...you know how this shit takes over your mind). I just know that this will only bring me down in the long run, so I'd rather get out alive. Especially considering how many friends I know who have died from opiate overdoses. 

So pretty much, with this, I guess it's just something for you guys to consider. Do you want to do it for your whole life? If so, think deep down if that's a really good idea and if you want to give the rest of your life to a temporary high. If not, when would you stop? Do you need a good reason? I did. Luckily it didn't involve me getting in trouble but it was a huge fucking wake up call and I never want to put my mom through that again. Like if I get caught by the cops or have to go to the hospital. Ah. It was fun while it lasted, but I have to put up with never touching that shit.

I've been trying to find out info about this with the magic of google, but haven't come across much.

I was wondering, how often or how much do you have to take to start getting withdrawal symptoms?  I recently got some roxy 30s after a 2 year hiatus from opiates, and experienced the following:

- Day 1 - Took half a roxy 30
- Day 3 - Took half a roxy 30
- Day 5 - Felt crappy and nauseous
- Day 12 - Took 3/4 of a roxy 30
- Day 14 - Felt shaky, nauseous, and had diarrhea.

Now, I know some of these are withdrawal symptoms, but I absolutely would not even remotely expect these to occur with the light use I've had and the fact that I've spaced things out somewhat.  Is it a coincidence?  I realize everybody is going to be different, so there's no one rule for these things, but I'm just really surprised.  Some of it could be because I have IBS (Irritable bowel syndrome) which probably makes me more prone to digestive issues.

Maybe I'll have to space out my use to every 2 weeks to avoid it.

The stuff I get from this connect is always super sticky and melty. I have had other tar that stayed rock hard all the time. This stuff starts out firm and ends up incredibly goopy. 

Is $100 a gram a pretty common price for tar?

Can anyone tell me how tar gets cut and/or what they cut it with? The goop I get looks consistent throughout. I have had some more firm tar that I could see different colors in and it was not nearly as potent as the goop. The goop also has a strong odor.

Many of you probably already know about this method but I wanted to share my experience.

Prep time - five minutes; Cook Time - 3 to 4 hours
Ingredients:

*1 bottle of coke (other sodas may work, I just haven't tried)
*OP (I used an 80)

Preparation

1. Grind you pill down with an appropriate tool. I used a pedegg that cost me ten dollars at rite-aid. Don't even worry about getting the coating off, just grind that bitch down whole. Make sure you grind it onto some sort of piece of paper or whatever so you can easily transfer to the bottle. It should look like eraser shavings when you're done.

2. Dump the eraser shavings into the bottle of coke and let sit for 3 hours or so. You know it's done when the shavings are completely dissolved.  I suggest leaving the bottle in a warm place to facilitate the process.

3. Pour that coke over some ice and enjoy!

For me I was feeling the effects before I even finished the glass so I know the time release was beat. In fact it was stronger than an OC 80 as they put more of the drug into the OP's since they're not intended to release all of the Oxy.

(check some of my older pics too!) keep in mind while reading this i've been in the game for 4+ years so these last few months have been crazy cool.


i've been insanely lucky recently. i had a couple super faded weeks using close to a hundred fentanyl patches - 25mcg, 50mcg & 100mcg (duragesic 100's are OUTSTANDING, mylan good, mallis are trash) all were non-gel, but still work great when cut in the right size strips to apply on the inside of the gums. days later, then came along 1600mcg fent pops.

 never seen any fent before so the lollipops plus the patches practically emptied my bank account. (by the way, 1600mcg pops are overrated. they contain 1.6mg of fent which does nothing for me while the duragesic 100's contain nearly 10x fent) not a ton of euphoria but a great nod and cool to be able to just dose anywhere and post up with a patch.


i just got done with that little segment of using and now i've come across ANOTHER product that i've never encountered before... motherfuckin oxycodone hydrochloride solution, AKA liquid oxy. each bottle has 60mL, with 1mL containing 20mg's. (quick math, 600mg's a bottle). i get the bottles for $80 a pop, sealed which is a steal. it does feel pretty weak compared to the pill form, but combined with a few roxi's it's pretty cool.


but yeah, i wanna know who likes mixing their opis (especially OC) with coke? i've actually always disliked it until i met a homie that has some shit that is unreal. it's just... damn. this last weekend my schedule throughout the day was 6mL of oxy solution, 3 blues sniffed (A215's), almost a G of some out-of-this world chowder, and of course a xanax bar or two.

Very soon I'll be heading to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam and am curious about what pharmaceutical opiates the community would recommend. 

From what I've read morphine, codeine, dihydrocodeine and tramadol are readily available. I was planning on sticking mainly to morphine though I would be limited to oral administration and I'm worried that the low oral BA would render it as timid a drug as the others. Also assuming I am able to smuggle a small quantity of pills back would it just be best to aim for 80mg morphine tablets and not even bother with the weaker opiates? Would just shelfing a pill work or is it necessary to dissolve/crush it?


I understand that heroin is widely available over there though as I tend to be into a very different drug scene the stigma is holding me back. The friends I'm travelling with would look down on IVing or even using an oral syringe for rectal administration and as I'm in no dire need to get high I'll probably stick with popping pills and smoking a little opium.",1350373147.0

My husband and I have been using h for approx. a year (only smoking, neither of us has ever tried IV). We had intermittently used various pills for several years before that, but not on a regular basis. For the first half of this year, we were probably using between a half gram and a gram of black per day, an amount we were concerned about and, frankly, ashamed of. It had escalated quickly as is often the case when sales come into the picture. Fast forward a few months, selling is no longer involved because of the huge negative impact it had on our life (not only usage-wise, but because of the incessant calls from buyers, stress resulting from money problems, constant fear of getting caught up, etc) and we did a pretty good job of reducing our daily usage, perhaps to a .4/.5 each per day. For the last month we've been diligently tapering off in an effort to finally kick the habit completely; we can't afford it at all now that the sales days are long behind us and as newlyweds we cannot justify pouring our paychecks into drugs when we have responsibilities to attend to. I feel like we're getting our life back and we've reduced our usage to a meager .2 maximum each day and any w/d symptoms are much more tolerable than before.

That brings me to this afternoon, when a whole new issue just presented itself unexpectedly. I woke up this morning thinking we were doing great, just a couple more days from our target, when someone suggested to my husband that the best way to wean ourselves off the last little amount (essentially, to maintain the very low usage level and allow our bodies to re-regulate while using/buying very minor amounts) would be to shoot it up. The argument, I guess, is that we could split a half gram over several days if injected, whereas smoking it requires more -- and our finances just don't have any room for more at this point.

If I'm being honest with myself, I am terrified by the thought of even going there. We've made it this far without giving in to any offers to try IV. That step is where many of our friends dove head first into a deeper problem than they had before, which sounds terrible to me when we've worked this hard to taper ourselves off with nothing but diligence and hard work. So, my questions: has anyone else received this as a suggestion for tapering off, or is this person misinformed and further passing along that misinformation to us? Would this be a good idea or a terrible one?

The last issue is that my husband prefaced the pitch with, ""The reason why I'm entertaining this thought is because it's something I've always wondered about, even before we ever got involved in the first place. If we quit this weekend without ever trying it I almost feel as though I'll think like ***** [friend who went through a similar situation, tried to quit suddenly without a plan or ""getting in his kicks"" for lack of a better term] did and relapse because I didn't get it out of my system."" To me that sounds like it could be his mind trying to justify a questionable solution to a serious problem that we've spent months trying to remedy. But at the same time, if it's really something he wants to try, I do recognize that this is the absolute last time it will ever be an option. I am not as well educated about the effects of different usage methods (bio-availability and whatnot) like my husband is, and he seems to think this is a good recommendation, so I wanted to ask you all what you think: would it be worth it to try this as a way to wean ourselves off that last little bit we've been using or are we asking to set ourselves back? Or, if the tapering thing is a total no-go, would it be worthwhile to try to shoot up one time to quell any curiosity about it and then get back on our quitting schedule that's worked well for us thus far?

Sorry this is so long, I apologize for ranting -- this is just a very sudden and thought-consuming predicament. Any and all advice is much appreciated! I can take the heat, give it to me if you've got it. Thanks all.

**TL;DR:** A trusted friend advised my husband that, to help us make the last jump as we're tapering off using heroin, the most advantageous way to work down from the last .2 per day would be to shoot it up. Never tried it before; very apprehensive about taking that advice.",1350431333.0

When will it be over?,"So I've been dabbling with opiates for about a year now. Mostly oxy and hydro at first, but an unreliable dealer and high prices ensured that I never built an opiate habit. Recently I bought a bunch of cheap ass Tramadol from Mexico. Over a period of about three weeks I went from taking 200mg every other day to 250-300mg everyday, always co-administered with 50mg DPH. Although this may sound low, when I started taking the Trams I hadn't done any opiates for about a month and a half and I've always been unusually sensitive to Tramadol.

I stopped taking Tramadol a few days ago (Monday) because my friends were getting worried that I was starting to develop a habit. Sometime on Tuesday I noticed that I couldn't stop sniffling and I sneezed violently rather frequently. Since then I've noticed pain in my upper body (mostly arms and back), coughing, difficulty sleeping, vivid dreams that frequently cause me to wake up, dizziness, and a weird sensation that I think might be ""brain zaps"". Although these symptoms seem minor relative to ""real"" withdrawal they all seem to point towards some sort of opiate withdrawal, but is it really possible that this could develop after only a few weeks of use of such a weak opiate? When will this be over? Additionally, I had a minor stim habit--ethlyphenidate a few times a week--that I also quit. Does that factor into this at all?

bottle of xanax and kolonopin. i remeber the feeling of the first time takin a percocet, i was in heaven it was absolute bliss, i would nood n be in a dream world of pure euphoria, every time i itched in was an amazing sensation. when i started takin them i woiuld snort them. talk about a fuckin clogged nose, but the rush i would get from them was amazing. i would mix the benzos n percs they wer my fav combo. my tolerance rose n i would be poppin 8 perc 10s a day , stealin em n sellin em so they wer free 95% of the time, then my friend started fuckin wit roxis(oxycodone hcl 30mg or 15mg) btw i hate wen people call em perc 30s, ther is no such thing as a 30mg oxycodone with apap in it. but ne way i was tired of how bad they would make me itch n how many id have to take, my roa is snorting n i couldnt snort more then 2 percs so i was happy wen i was introduced to 30s, i remember i bought 2 15s( green a214s) i blew the whole thing n i was thinkin to my self hopefully i get high cuz i usally had to take 5 percs to get bent. so after i blew the jawns n the drip started i fell in love with tht drip, i started to nood hard as shit n was feelin better on tht 30mg roxi then 5 percs, but i didnt have tht heavenly high tht i used to get, after an hour wen by i started throwin up,. cuz i did to much i guess. i started doin em once a week then twice n all the way up to everyday, my tolerence wen from 1 to 2 to get high, after a summer of being bar faced n 30'd out n stealing my dads jewlery n pills n gettin kicked out of my moms n gettin aressted, i went to rehab on the day after my birthday, i wen fer 2 weeks n was dead set on stayin ckean i came bacj n went to take a shit opened up the cabinet under the sink n a bottle of roxi 30mg sittin right ther, i thought about it n took litteraly a hand full, went up stairs n got high as shit, after tht i started doing them on my dads weekedns(every other weekend) then every weekend then 3 days a wekk plus weekend, my tolerance went from 1 n ahalf jawns to get me high to 4 jawns to get me high, i would average at 7-10 roxis a day, n after my dad got scripted roxis i was gettin them for free, i would do the same things wit them tht i would do with the percs, ma dad would notice i was stealing them n i would just denie it n he would sell his zannz to get more 30s. he would lock em in a safe, i would find the key, he would lock his door, i would pick his lock. after 4 months of bein addicted again i went back to rehab but for a month, i got out, n on 12/27/12 my dad died from an overdose on roxis, 5 days later my sister and i wer supposed to go over his house for  new years eve, on the way down ther i had a bad feelin, i went in to see if he was home,i went up stairs and saw him laying dead, not gonna go into detail, i was in shock, ther was a bottle of his roxis next to him so i emptied the bottle into my pocket. after tht i was put on suboxone, was clean until july. after i relapsed i would take 30s here n ther, tolerance was low again, but it was real hard to get high cuz i was on ubs n got drug tested, so on monday i would stop using my subs n then i would get drug tested thursday n get high on friday cuz of subs rediculous half life.after getting tht rutine down my tolerence went right back up to 4 roxis to get high, about  a month n a half ago i ran out of roxis, so sad;[. so then i was trynna figurre out wat to do, n thought roxis wer to pricey at 1$ a mg, n id need 4 of em to get me high so it would be 120$ to get high fer 2 hours... fuck tht i said, n i was like i alays wanted to try dope, n its much cheaper n stronger, so then i hit my boy up n asked if i could go cop dope wit him so we did, the set was right outside of camden n ther stamps wer wowww, real shit

ONE bag wit my boy n im fucked up noodin like i did 4 30s. pure china white n fat bag. the following weekend we do the same thing go to the same place but got different shit, michael myers was the stamp n i coped a bun, this girl i used to chill wit hit me up n asked if i could give her a ride out to the city i cop another bun of self made n she got a couple bags n a 10 of powder, we got back

I usually try to break up my shit as fine as possible and split it up into an even amount of lines all of the same size. I then take turns blowing one line at a time up *each* nostril. I figure I'm giving the drug more surface area to work with and thus am promoting a higher amount of absorption. This is just what I tell myself though. 

Sometimes I have a really stuffy nostril and despite attempts to clear it, it remains too plugged up to blow anything. On these occasions I say 'fuck it' and just blow all of it up the one nostril that isnt plugged up and try my best to avoid over shooting and creating a wasteful drip. 

During the latter instance do you guys think I'm absorbing *less* of the drug than if I had managed to successfully split it up amongst both of my nostrils?

Any advice?,"I've had chronic back pain for 10 years (the end of this month will make 10 years). I fell off single story roof, landed on my feet and received a compound fracture to L4-L5.

In the last two weeks, this pain has gotten **way worse**, really quickly and gradually. It hurts especially when I sit down or lay down, and it's very concentrated to my lower left spinal-area. I can't even get up from laying down with out my boyfriend pulling me up. My hip and left leg also hurt, and coughing/laughing/any movement causes it to hurt more.

I see my doctor tomorrow afternoon (well, today -- can't sleep). Currently, all she prescribes me is 2 5mg Vicodin a day (yeah, wow, doesn't last long). I really need to convey to her that I have a very serious problem. She is going to be sending me to a specialist (the referral is in the works), but that will take more than a month. I simply cannot wait that long in this kind of pain. It truely is hell.

I went on WebMD and looked at the symptom checker, which said the most likely cause was a herniated disc, and a lot of the symptoms are uncannily like mine, so I've written them down and will show my notes to my doctor tomorrow.

Bropiates, can you please help me convince her that I really need her help now (without sounding like I'm ""searching""), that this is very serious and I can't wait for a month while the referral goes through? Because I know she's going to say she'd rather I wait til I see him.

What should I do?

**Edit**: Thanks for all your helpful responses everyone. She was actually surprisingly receptive, but I'm still waiting for that referral. She gave me a shot of Toradol (big help for a pain-free evening, pain came back in the morning) and a prescription for Methocarbamol (wish it were helping), and also said I can start taking 3 of my Vicodin a day as needed. My refill is in a few days and I think she's bumping it up to 90 at least until I can see the specialist.

She noted some twisting in my lower spine which is one of the reasons for the extra pain on my left side, mentioning that structurally, my left side has been making up for the problems on the right all these years. She said there may be a herniation as well.

She also said I could come back at any time if it gets worse/doesn't get better soon and she'll see what else she can do. She isn't a specialist in that field but she is very smart. I'm just hoping to see the specialist soon and that nothing more happens. I'm going to be keeping some of your suggestions in mind for next time. I just thought I wasn't good at talking to doctors, but someone said ""show [the doctor] this post.""

I went across to the shops and bought a packet of 20 2mg tablets of loperamide (brand imodium in USA), popped them all out of the blister wrap and managed to swallow them in one gulp (small capsules).

About 2 - 2.5 hours after that, all of my withdrawl symptoms are gone and i almost feel like im on half a MG of bupe (which is more then enough for my wd's). I'm optimistic, no longer hurting, in fact i feel better then sober.

I've used vicodin and oxy for 5+ years, taking a few months off a year and not escalating my dosage in response to tolerance. I do this out of necessity more than anything as I'm prone to 'rebound migraines' as a result of taking too much for too long.

I've just fallen off my health coverage, and the only thing I can really afford on the street is 8mg subs. My first experience with it was humbling, I took half (I now do tenths of a strip at a time) and had trouble breathing and keeping food down. But subsequent lower doses have provided relief for my moderate, chronic neck pain and headaches.

My question to you, before I go out and get any more; Should I even start down the road with this chemical? It doesn't seem suited to my needs, other than it's low cost, being a w/d aid. I'm confused as to how it works with/versus other opiates and my other medications (currently just Prednisone for specific migraine episodes).

Any and all of your two cents are welcome and appreciated. Thanks!

How often do you need to raise your dosages due to tolerance and does your doctor always comply?

Thanks for providing your stories and situations. If you're not into abuse and have a legitimate condition requiring opiates, then I would highly recommend /r/chronicpain

I've had peripheral neuropathy for quite some time due to type 1 diabetes. The past few years, I've sought medical help for the pain. I jumped through so many hoops and tried just about every other alternative out there for more than 2 years before opiates were prescribed.

I currently take OxyContin 10mg 3x daily and Oxycodone 5mg 4x daily. It seems like every 6months to a year I feel like I need to raise my dose but I've only had to do that once and really feel that less is more because I don't want to take massive doses and feel nothing within a span of 5 or 10 years. I will be having this painful condition for life, so I need to make sure I take my medication accordingly.

Thanks

As you can imagine takeing this dose every day I am experiencing some very uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and I started reading around the internet for withdrawal cures when I came across a forum which stated that in certain states at the discretion of the head pharmacist, small amounts of codeine containign syrups could be purchased as long as you show id and fill out a log or something. I called a few pharmacies around and they all said I would have to check out independent pharmacies well thats no problem there are a few around me.

Even if am able to acquire one of these syrups we're not talking about codeine/prometh combinations probably more along the lines of codeine and guaifensin(sp) and I read that alot of guaf on your stomach could cause nausea and vomiting. So to all the drug nerds out there does anyone know of an extraction tek or process similar to CWE with hydros that could help get rid of the nasty and keep the codeine?

If you want context, read the wall o' text, if not, the tl;dr will be fine.

Welbutrin has been a kind of a mixed bag for me. I was way in the deep end August-September, detoxed myself cold turkey, which I will never ever do again when I have pills I could eat, and after two months of counseling and a month of welbutrin, I am at a much better place with my relationships, school, and drugs. 

One of the first things that I noticed about webutrin was that I no longer felt the need to have any nicotine in the morning, and would only get cravings late at night. The tobacco I put in my spliffs doesn't seem to taste as good either. That's cool. 

And here's the bad: I feel like I don't feel the full euphoria of opiates anymore, even with a ""I'm serious about quitting break"" (although I only made it 3 weeks) which should have lowered my tolerance. I don't know if welbutrin blocks opiates in some way, but all of a sudden, I'm getting nauseus from opiates like when I first started taking them. I know not to take what I was taking before, but even moderate doses are making me sick, and a low enough dosage to avoid nausea doesn't do much for me. 

Anyone have any experience with welbutrin and opiates? An aside... welbutrin is fucking awesome for withdrawal. It hits the right pleasure receptors, and the first week or so, it felt like I had taken some speed. I could actually focus on work, I was excited to see people, and I didn't want to smoke. I don't know how it would do with the physical stage, but it was great for making me want to live life again during PAWS. I should just stay clean, but I just picked up a bunch of IR 10mg oxys, and they are a nice break from the suboxone. 

If you have any questions about welbutrin, I'm happy to answer them, but I'd love to here /r/opiates experiences too.

TL;DR - experiences with welbutrin, did you experience negative effects when opiates are taken in combination? Does the welbutrin weaken the effects for you? Does the welbutrin and opiate combo make you nauseus even at relatively low doses (for your tolerance)?

Some vicodin found me pretty recently and I just can't seem to get high or ""nod"" off of them. I have 5/500's and 7.5/750's, the 7.5's expired december 2011. They make me more sociable and give me energy, and they make me itchy, but I can't seem to get high off of them. I did a cwe with 3 7.5's and a 5, which didnt do anything. I did another with 4 7.5's, also nothing.
Could it be that the 7.5's lost their potency? Also, the last 2 times I smoked weed I barely felt anything. Maybe I'm just oblivious to what I'm feeling? I'm 130 lbs, 16. No preaching please, I recently became an athiest and I've heard enough sermons to last me for the rest of my life.
Thanks in advance!

Edit: Thanks to everyone for the responses, they honestly mean a lot. I decided to cwe 7 7.5's, and I lost about 10% of the liquid thanks to my darned shakey hands. I ate a cashew cluster.

I take pain killers because I need them, but let's be honest, they feel good.

That being said, how much, or rather how little should I take? I've read up on them, and I know how powerful and dangerous they are. I plan on taking a little strip, a 16th, and putting it in the inside of my cheek.

So im well versed in none opiates, and very familiar with codeine phos. Over the last 6 months or so I have been dabbling with small quantities of H, #3.

I have been snorting between approx 25 - 100mg, over the course of between 2 - 6 hours. This has been far from frequent, at most twice a month and usually accompanied be a few glasses of red wine. In all previous opiate experiences, including two stays in hospital with morphine on the button, ive never been sick, or felt sick.

However, tonight, after a couple of beers, and about an hour after eating i did 4 small bumps within about 30mins, id guess at total about 25mg max. About 5 mins after the second line I felt *really* nauseous and this continued for about 45 mins, progressively getting worse till I made myself throw up. After doing so I felt great.

Now I know H in infamous for making people without a tolerance throw up, but its  never happened to me previosuly. Is it down to what was sat in my stomach? What can be done to help prevent this going forward?

When I got sober I got some of my friends and all of my family back.  One of my closest friends that I have been friends with since the sixth grade blew me off the other day.

Because as an addict I am miserable, unless I just got high I have realized that this lifestyle is not worth losing even one thing on the long list of good things that sobriety gives me.  I am not going to lose this friend.

I would like to think that I could be a chipper, but I know that isn't possible.  I am a low bottom addict and I know that my only way out alive is to get out now.

Whenever I stop doing opiates for any period of time I am plagued my a never ending slew or opiate related dreams. Occasionally they are over the top and involve finding vials of powdered Dilaudid or ziplock bags of old formula OC 80s. For the most part the are just run of the mill, I can't find a spike, frustration dreams.
     Last night I dreamed that I kept trying to cook up but my mother (who for some reason was in the unknown house/hotel that the dream was taking place) kept walking in on me. I kept having to hide the whole rig at whatever stage of the cooking process I was in and hoping nothing got hurt. At the en of the dream I heard her coming toward the bathroom that I was trying to fix in and had to set the cooker down after I had aleady added the water. I prayed the water wouldn't spill, but just as she was leaving and I reached down to try to really smoothly lift it up from behind the counter where I had hidden it, my hand knocked it and it flipped over spilling all over the floor and under the counter. It was the last bag I had and my old roommate was in the living room nodding out on the floor in some kind of makeshift sleeping bag waiting on me to come join him. I just started crying hysterically, I didn't feel sick in my dream, just so disappointed. The way that you might feel if you have a suboxone script, but got home and realized you lost the bags you were saving for the night. You can take the suboxone. You'll be ok. But....shit dude. My mother came into the room at that point at which point I started screaming at her for not just leaving me alone for five goddamn minutes. 
     It made me think about other opiate related dreamed that have been reported to me by friends, and how they seem to often have similar themes. Obtaining the impossible (OC 80s), coming so close and then waking up seconds before you were able to get high, etc. I just wondered what kind of things you guys dream out, do you ever feel the high in your dreams, does it make you feel worse or better when you wake up?

It just doesn't seem to work out.,"Hi r/opiates, longtime lurker. I find this sub fascinating and honestly inspiring even though I'm not an addict. 

I used to think being high constantly on opiates would obviously feel good. Euphoria, apathy, analgesia, etc. etc.

But I have been using Kratom to stop taking Lexapro and the downsides of opiates are becoming more apparent.

* tolerance: I've never seen other drugs like it. It seems more exponential than linear. After just two months of use I need almost twice as much kratom and I get much less euphoria (about the same analgesia). Even after a weeklong break tolerance seemed *exactly* the same. A weeklong break from MJ would destroy my tolerance.

* apathy: doesn't it get depressing to just watch your life float by like a movie or a dream? It's nice for a few days but after a week on kratom I feel so disinclined to do anything at all. This is how I know to take a break. I would only find this nice if I was in severe emotional pain.

* losing the magic: I just don't get the feelings from it that I did at first. The effects I need for SSRI withdrawal still work (fewer brain zaps, reduced muscle ache, great migraine analgesia, emotional stability) but the euphoria is almost completely gone unless I intentionally go overboard. The mild psychedelia, empathy, and self-confidence are gone completely.

Don't worry about me; I'm taking a *longgg* break from kratom after this week because I'm finally off the Lex! My question is, how do you all deal with the bad effects and the loss of good effects? Are most opiate addicts in chronic pain? - because that's the only reason *I* can see for wanting to be opiated 24/7. Or is euphoria a much bigger draw once you get to IV? (I've done H and it was nice and strong but not like earth-shatteringly different from Ox). Or just to avoid withdrawal? No offense, but unless you have a huge habit it's probably not that bad, SSRI is much worse (1-2 months instead of 5 days). Just trying to understand what daily users get out of opiates, since all the good effects seem to disappear with constant use.

I was just wondering, I hate asking about this because its been asked so many fucking times just not exactly this question and I'm really desperate so please don't give me shit bropiates, if the opiates will be out of my system by Tuesday morning between 930-10am and it's guna be a mouth swab test. You guys think it's possible my opiates will be out of my system(the gunpowder and norcos) and what should I do to help get them out im already and guna drink lots more water, anything else I should do?

I said alcohol and someone else chimed in and agreed with the caveat except for crack and heroin. I disagreed with her pointing out what bad shape a full alcoholic would be found in and that heroin is fairly benign in regards to physiological harm. It got me thinking about addiction rates though. What to you guys think the rate of addiction is in regards to opiates? Lets say addiction to the point of significant harm to the user(ie loss of relationships, money, home etc). How do you think it compares to other drugs, especially alcohol?

I found this chart

http://www.samhsa.gov/data/NSDUH/2k10ResultsTables/NSDUHTables2010R/HTM/Sect1peTabs1to46.htm#Tab1.1A

Which talks about illicit substances, it doesn't cover alcohol. There are some rudimentary numbers there but while comparing ""used in last year"" to ""used in last month"" is a pretty clever stat I don't think it is comprehensive. By that standard basically everyone is addicted to liquor.

I've personally known eight people who have used opiates for at least 6 months including myself. One is in rehab, three are addicts, three started to overuse but corrected and now chip responsibly, the other one rarely uses and never started to use daily. As for liquor, basically everyone I know has drank far to heavily for periods in their life but I don't know anyone who had to go to rehab, or really fucked up their life.

So anyways I am just curious as to what sort of addiction trends you all see in your lives. I also wouldn't mind hearing thoughts on why these trends seem to exist. Is it intrinsic to the drug or could their be other factors at play?

edit

As per request I'm clarifying how I think about addiction.

I define it as follows:

Addiction is an unhealthy relationship with a substance. Healthy is defined by the user

And I think about it as follows:

How would this user honestly respond to the question: ""Are you happy with where your life is at right now, and to what extent does your use of drug X contribute to the state of happiness/unhappiness present in your life?"".",1351933662.0

I have taken vikes and perks recreationally many times through my career as a drug enthusiast. I use MDMA, coke, and mushrooms here and there. I only drink maybe once or twice a year, though. I have never really had any kind of dependency, except for cigarettes, and weed.

About my About 3 weeks ago, a friend sold me 5 perk 5's. I ate them all over a course of about 6-7 hours. Nice and fuzzy. Totally typical. Saw the same friend about two days later, got 5 more, ate them over about 3-4 hours. Nice and fuzzy. Totally typical. I decide to catch up with an ex girlfriend I haven't seen in a long time.(The girl has been playing with opiates regularly, and had smoked some heroin here and there recently, but I didn't know this when I talked to her) Coincidentally, her friend is selling some Oxy 10s. Over a friday through Sunday, we went through  about 20 of them together. At this point, we had started snorting them. I had snorted pain pills before, but didn't really think much of it. Another couple days goes by, I'm really enjoying how pain pills just kind of taper off, and I don't feel like shit after using them. I pass up the opportunity to get some blow that weekend, thinking I want to take it really easy. I go to buy a big sack of weed, and my dealer mentions that he has the hookup on some really good H. I kind of turn up my nose and decline. That night I start to feel kind of sick and fluey, so I call in sick from work the next day and lounge around the house getting stoned.

My Ex calls. She comes over with some Oxy 30s. We get fucked up, cuddle, are completely in love again, and continue to use the 30s for the next couple days. 

Two more days pass, and we have no drugs except weed. I'm actually not really jonesing or craving opiates, which was somewhat surprising to me (hadn't payed attention to the fact I had only been a day or two at most without taking any...) but Im still feeling very fluey and generally uncomfortable. I mention that my dealer can get some heroin when my ex tells me the story about her and her recent boyfriend smoking it. We argue about it a little, but I give in, and we go get some. We got .5g. We smoked it over the next two days, and I was incredibly underwhelmed. It was only a little bit better than the pills we had been taking, but it was soooo much cheaper. My dealer didn't have a strong connect, so after those two days, I was sharing whatever pills my ex had around. A full week has passed since we got the H the first time. My dealer calls me again, saying he has some ""Awesome shit, straight from AZ to here"". We go and get the same amount .5g. This was on a sunday night. We smoke it this time over two days again, with a little to spare for me to smoke alone that next day (Wednesday). I barely get high at all even though It was substantial amount compared to what we were passing back and forth on the tinfoil the nights prior. That day, I am aware for the first time that I actually am craving the opiates. We pass the coming nights with netflix and blunts, trying to hook up with pills or H pretty aggressively. No luck. That next night, Im feeling pretty irritable, and can't really settle into any games or movies comfortably... but it's getting pretty late and I have to work. I take two tylenol PM, noticing a dull headache...I must be dehydrated or something...hmm.

I doze off for ten minutes or so, being awakened by jerky legs and the most extreme feelings of what the internet tells me is ""Akathisia"". I am suddenly very aware that 3 days is the longest I've been without an opiate of some form in my system. Holy shit, was I smoking heroin a few days ago? Im jonesing, hard. Thoughts of smoking the residue on the old tinfoil hanging around the room come to my mind. I had already struck out for hours with my dealer... what was I gonna do? I'm addicted to fucking heroin. Fuck. It's real and it happened and fuck that was fast and holy shit what am I gonna do...

I skip work the next day, smoke tons of pot, delete my dealers phone number, and refuse to buy my ex any pills, seeing her recent moodiness and need for alcohol when not having pills for what it is. I am all over the place all day. Thoroughly smoked out, but I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm so fucking thankful that I only had one dealer and that my ex is broke. Sweating, shitting, unable to shit, irritable, can't sit still, can't move. Can't play games, can't stand music, can't stand silence. I ended up driving an hour and getting some 10mg Zolpidem (Ambien, I think) and taking two just to get myself to sleep.

That was yesterday. The ambien actually put me to sleep, thank god. Today I feel pretty legit, with very brief panicky feelings here and there, but I'm almost back to what I'd consider normal.

That was fucking scary.

All I keep thinking is ""fuck, what if my dealer had come through before I had that experience on Thursday night? I would have been high as fuck...3-4 more days binging...then would I have been able to cut myself off, like I did yesterday?""

This post is probably jumbled, unorganized, the time frames are all off...but I think that you guys will understand me. 

Honestly the thing that pisses me off the most is that I probably won't ever be able to enjoy opiates again, without having terrible withdrawl symptoms and ending up abusing them pretty hard...and they were fucking awesome.

TL;DR: Went from orally ingesting 5mg oxys to smoking heroin in about 3 weeks time, got addicted (?), and barely made it out.

Thoughts/insight?

Someone please tell me Ill be cool if I want to rail some oxys in a couple weeks time, lol.

That is, those who were slamming half a bundle throughout Sunday, and then proceed to take 8mg of bupe come Monday and viola! off to class! 

I was better than them, I thought. I was special. I would slam a couple of bags but only on the weekends. I didn't get sick, only junkies got sick and I surely was not a junkie, I'm was just a.... well I was a vacationer, how's that? 

Nevertheless those whose used suboxone as a crutch always struck a particular nerve with me. I'm not sure why exactly but I think it has something to do with conceding the fact that they could not hold their own. They were junkies and they knew that and they needed their medication to make them normal.

Well after I graduated from a school upstate I moved west to Colorado to intern in a lab, and then I got a gig working in a hospital. Oh, I also got a delivery service for $15 .3s of tar. And well I'll cut it short and say that I became a junkie and had to flee back east as $75 a day was rather costly. 

Back home I got a script for that which I had so criticized in the past. Starting out at 16mgs I got down to 1-2mg over the course of about 5 months. Clean with an astrick if you will.

Now however, as in right now, currently, I have become what previously hated. When I get money I get a couple of bags and have fun. The dope overpowers the 1mg I took the previous night easily. The next day I wake up and take another 1mg and I'm back to normal. Everything is fine. I feel fine. I could always feel better, but can't we all?

And goddammit, I hope I can make it work.","AA always talks about hitting rock bottom.  I don't think I'm there yet.  Sure, shit's been pretty bad for the last year or so.  My relationship with my girlfriend was in constant limbo with nothing but fighting as a result of my being completely distant and withdrawn.  My libido has been non-existent.  I have fallen out of touch with most of my friends for the same reason, and even made enemies of at least one of them (who at one point was among the most important).  I have no money to spend, but I can still at least make rent, and even though the psychological obsession drives me INSANE I don't really get so thoroughly dopesick that I can't go to work.  So things could technically be worse, and likely will be soon if I don't stop.  

For 8 years I've been IV-ing Oxy, morphine, Dilaudid, methadone, opana, fantanyl, heroin, basically whatever I can get my hands on.  I love it.  And I hate it.  I think I'm finally ready to be done.  I've done one run-through with inpatient and it failed.  Tomorrow, I'm trying something different and registering with the local methadone clinic.  I think I will try to do methadone maintenance for a few weeks so that I can at least still feel something from what I'm given.  In the meantime I will destroy all my syringes and equipment, and after an interim period switch to suboxone so that I can eliminate the chance of a relapse giving me any kind of high or reward.  I am terrified to make this change, because opiates have always been my secret lover, my silent confidant, and the one thing I could always turn to to make the bad times okay and the good times even better.

12vms7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/12vms7/methadone_dosing_advice/,4,https://redd.it/12vms7,inandouttrout,Methadone dosing advice,"Hello, all. So I was hoping to get a little advice regarding dosing with recreational usage of methadone. Now, I know that many of you feel that methadone has no recreational value, but I personally disagree. 

I am an occasional opiate user, and over the years I've used just about every one of them on the list minus fentanyl and oxymorphone. I've never had a regular habit, though, just occasional use and sometimes a little binge (no longer than a week) usually with dope. So I'd say it's safe to say I have a pretty low tolerance. I recently received a 40 milligram capsule of methadone, and am trying to figure out the best way of dosing it. 

My most recent use of opiates prior to this was some oral morphine for four days in a row (skipping one day) about a week and a half ago. Prior to that....nada for a couple of months. My cozy dosage with the oral morphine was about 60mg, so I used our handy converter that's on the sidebar there and was told that 6mg of Methadone should be comparable. That, coupled with the fact that reading through some threads here and elsewhere and hearing again and again that 5mg was a good starting dose, made me decide upon 5mg to start. 

So I dosed 5mg this morning at ~9am. I waited until around 1pm and still I wasn't feeling much of anything, so I dosed another 5mg. Now, throughout the day, I've gotten some mood elevation, some comfort, some sedation, but nothing to write home about. Now, at 7:15pm, I'm pretty disappointed. Don't want to redose today, because I'm wary of increasing negative side effects without gaining an equal increase in positive effects. So the earliest I'd redose would be tomorrow morning. 

Before some of you say that methadone simply sucks, I used to do it recreationally in my college years and had some wonderful wonderful experiences with it - day-long highs spent grinning in the museums and on the piers of Chicago, lasting long into the night with a little nod on the train ride home...truly excellent.  However, when I was doing it then, I was receiving portions of liquid doses measured out into cough medicine caps by someone on the management program, and never know for sure how much I was taking (absolutely retarded I know, but I am at least a little bit older and wiser now).

So my first suspicion is that I simply dosed too low today? I have 30 mg left and my main question is should I skip tomorrow to let my system clear of it, then dose something more like 20mg on Saturday? Or take a little more tomorrow, say another 10mg, let more build, and then keep moving forward like that?

Opiates are incredibly scarce in the country in which I'm currently living, so I really want to get the most enjoyment possible out of this and methadone is so tricky to dose properly (esp considering acute and chronic issues) in order to achieve a safe yet fun and euphoric high. Somehow that bropiate of mine back in Chicago knew exactly the amount I needed back then :)

As a little more info - I am a male, and weigh about 170lbs. BTW, I typically prefer a functional, grinny euphoria, as opposed to a heavily sedated, nodding type of high.

Thanks in advance for any and all advice folks. 

p.s. I've heard that cyclizine is the mother of all potentiaters for methadone, but it sadly does not exist where I currently live. This country is a black hole for virtually any and all things opiate. I have plenty of benzos but will not be using them to potentiate for safety concerns and also because I don't tend to like them to begin with. ",1352410918.0

He fixed himself a good strong shot, more than i'd ever seen him do ever, he shot up and less than 5 minutes later he was drooling all over himself and seizing.We called him an ambulance ASAP but he was unresponsive and barely breathing. We didn't wait a second to call 911 as soon as it became clear he wasn't responding.


We performed CPR until the paramedics arrived and took over but they got him to sit up and look around for a little bit before he nodded back out. On the way out of his house he was sitting up and we made eye contact.

 At this point what are the chances of him dieing? He's healthy as hell minus being a opiate addict. Works out a lot. I spoke with his parents and the paramedics and told everyone there what happened and what he was on. Based on them getting him to respond is there a good chance he is going to be okay?


EDIT: My friend is okay. We got him out of the Hospital a few hours ago around 2 AM eastern time. We live in Baltimore. First thing he asked was what we did with the syringes and the dope, we flushed it as soon as the call to the ambulance was made. He found out he might have an heart condition due to some abnormal rhythm/patterns, the doctor's recommended he see a specialist and stop doing drugs. His parents are pissed as hell but whatever. Thanks everyone, I was reading these comments in the waiting room and it helped take some concern away. One of the paramedics made a comment to me that his lips were turning blue when they were resuscitating him and that if he were left alone that way he could have died.

Again, thanks guys!",1352688668.0

Once you mash through that (I have used a pair of pliars to grip it and just crack it enough to remove it.) you have a little pill.  Half white, Half black.  White being the dilly, black being the trash.  But before you can get to it, there is another very thin, somewhat tough plastic liner that wraps the entire pill.  Best way I can describe it is almost like a thick tough scotch tape.  Its a bitch to remove.  Messing with these takes some time.  Once you've got the plastic off and you've separated the dilly from the trash, how do you proceed to make the best of these?  

Even once everything is removed the white part of the pill is still pretty hard doesn't crush very well.  Never tried using a ped-egg on it. Has anyone ever shot one of these?

I have a source that has them and will just give em to me but previous expierences the trouble to get through all the bullshit wasn't worth the final outcome.

Preface: I'm not here to judge, urge anyone to quite, make accusations or be negative towards users in ANY way.  I am also not a cop or affiliated with any branch of the government (for the paranoid).

About me: young M.Sc. grad looking to give back to my community of East Van, BC, Canada by engaging everyone I can about our drug problem.

My ultimate goal: to open a government-back, fully funded, Heroin Assisted Therapy clinic in my city (something akin to HAT in Switzerland cerca 1980's).  Staffed by nurses, doctors and other people who want to help those that are suffering and seek help... not forcing it on those who do not.

I won't go into details about Vancouver here, but we have a large portion of our populace addicted to heroin.  We are a port city and it doesn't help that our ports are responsible for a majority of dope influx into North America.

We have taken two steps in the right direction, however.  We have INSITE - a safe injection facility and have an ongoing SALOME project which is the same as NAOMI was in the states.  There's also a provincial election coming up this year, which I believe can be leveraged heavily to help those in need.

So how about it r/opiates, would you be willing to host some open and honest q/a about habits/treatment/policing/potential cures/remedies/anything goes?   

I have a few questions off the bat that I'm interested in having input from you all on and I hope that this series turns into something organic where we will all find new topics to spin off into from ongoing discussions.

I'm going offline for tonight but will eagerly answer any questions/concerns first thing tomorrow morning :-)

Not mega high doses but have been on this for months. Basically its not really working as much for me anymore and my doctor and I have talked about moving onto morphine. I live in the UK and no real middle ground of oxy etc available, seems to be quite a jump but its NHS and free so can't complain. Basically will the move to morphine be a huge step, whats long term morphine use like day to day, and if I stop the tramadol will I get withdrawal? I know that codeine metabolises to morphine but not quite sure about tramadol. I have had morphine before during bouts of acute pancreatitis (IV in hospital) but am a bit worried about long term use. I'm mostly worried about possibility of abuse as in hospital its controlled but at home there would be nothing stopping me adding an extra bit to my dose. I have little self restraint.

","I'm sorry I just need to rant. I seriously can't catch a fucking break. I've had a six-month run of bullshit luck that culminated in a root canal last week. 

anyway.

God dammit. So I've spent the last two months carefully attempting to convince a doctor that I have ADD. Why? Because legal amphetamine, holy shit. I'd kill for that. 

I don't know if I actually have ADD or not, probably not, but I'm having a really hard time getting shit done at work. I sit in my cube and watch work pile up and I'm powerless to do anything about it. I just sit there and stress out and hate myself. I started having panic attacks a few months ago. 

I've tried for *years* now to convince docs that I have ADD. It always takes months - hours and hours of talking to a shrink or other bullshit. Tedious pysch tests. And all of those copays are *expensive*. Every time in the past, the tests would come back and tell me that I don't have ADD. Then I go home, pissed off.

I'm on new health insurance now so I decided to try it again. And I almost got it! I took the computerized ADD test and it came back telling me that I had a pretty strong case. Amazing right? Only one small issue: I have to take a piss test before they prescribe me any amphetamines. I did a lot of research and from what I could tell, this test was unlikely to pick up on oxy. Heroin/codeine/morphine would show up, but if it was similar to a 5-panel test the oxy should have gone by unnoticed. 

I took the test last week. I'm out of town for a few weeks and I didn't want to wait, so I asked the doc to email my my results. I just heard back. I failed. I had to quit smoking weed for this shit and I did, cold turkey. Cold turkey'd a 3-year, multiple times per day, every day habit. That really fucking sucked. I'm still having nightmares and I barely eat at all. I lost a lot of weight. 

So now I guess I'm gonna try to fucking quit opiates for a while so I can take this piss test again. I have no idea how I'm gonna do it, I'm properly fucking addicted. Two years of 3x a day usage has resulted in a ~200mg, $100+ per day habit. I don't know how the hell I'm gonna stop. I guess I'll try suboxone or something but still that's gonna take weeks. 

Shit like this makes me dream of my plane going down or getting hit by a drunk driver or some other random, senseless, quick death. fuck.

Where I'd like to start (bear with me, this will grow as we progress):  
- What got you started on opiates?  
- Did you transition into opiates or was it your first choice?  
- What is your opiate of choice (please be specific; black tar, afghani, china white, pills)  
- How many times a day do you medicate?  
- How do you fund your need?  
- Have you committed crimes to facilitate your need? (no specifics required, just yes/no if you feel uncomfortable)  
- Have you sought treatment?  
- If so, what kind? (AA, methadone, ibogaine, cold-turkey).
- Was it effective?  
- If not, why do YOU believe it failed you?  
- If so, why do YOU believe it worked?

Some places list plugging at 10%, the same as oral administration.  Other places give it the same amount as snorting (roughly 50%).  My understanding is bioavailability orally is low on heroin/oxymorphone because the stomach acid destroys a lot of the drug before it is absorbed.  Is this thinking correct?  If so, then I would expect rectal to be equivalent to nasal as I assume the acid has been neutralized by the time the shit hits your colon (so to speak).

What do others think ?  

BTW I am amazed how plastic like these pills are.  A nail file does nothing.  You really need a pedegg or a dremel tool.  I ended up chewing the pill until I could feel no more bits, then putting the spit into an oral syringe and plugging.  1 20 mg opana did quite well and I'm sure I wasted some of it.

Took 10 mg (orally, just taking the pill), then an hour took another 10 mg by crushing it up and putting it into water. About 30 minutes after that I kind of felt it. Little bit later I got really nauseous, then threw up. That relieved the nausea and I felt pretty good for a little bit, but the feeling was never near as strong as I was hoping or wanted it to be.  
  
I was really hoping for a very nice body and euphoria. I was pretty disappointed overall. I am very interested in opiates in general, but as of right now the hydros are all I have access to. I really really hate throwing up and my throat is still sore from it, I don't want to go through that again.  
  
Is this a normal first time experience? Or is it just not for everyone? Is it even worth trying again or should I just wait until I can get access to a better opiate? Should I up my dose* or something?

It's ok if you're not european.,"Well I've done plenty of heroin in my life, but as an American living on the east coast, I've always spent my time putting #4 into my body via various ROAs. 

I will soon be acquiring what I know with certainty to be #3 dope and have a few questions that I hope someone here can answer. 

1.) As far as I've gathered from Google-fu, it is possible to snort #3, but it is more or less inefficient and wasteful compared to sniffing #4. Any experience on this from anyone? Concerned mainly because ""up the sniffer"" is my preferred ROA. Can you mix with weak acid powder and snort the whole powdery lot? Can you wet-rail or whatever the fuck it's called when you sniff liquid? If so, can anyone break that process down for me or tell me if it's worth the effort...from experience?

2.) I have IV'd, but by in large prefer to stay away from it because it's too tasty - however, I do like sticking things in my ass. So, considering that #3 requires a weak acid to dissolve, could I hypothetically prepare a shot just as I would for IV, but in an oral syringe and then shoot it up my hungry brown-eye? 

3.) On that note, I've heard that one needs just pure, powdered citric acid....is this commonly available in the U.S.? Supermarkets, pet shops, pool supply stores, I don't fucking know.... I've heard Vitamin C pills are commonly used but can be dangerous due to binders present, however I'm thinking that danger might be largely reserved for IV administration? Maybe no problem for the bum bum? 

4.) Is there ANY method that is less of a cirque du soleil for your hands and face than chasing the dragon? I'm guessing probably not because I've yet to hear of anything different, but seeing as this is reddit, perhaps someone has a ""life hack"" kind of suggestion for smoking #3 that doesn't require half a roll of tin foil and excellent coordination. 

5.) Finally, I wish you could all come hang out with me whilst trying #3 for the first time. I'm lonely. Plus, it would be fun to have one of you silly rascals slip that oral syringe into my quivering balloon-knot for me. 

Muchas gracias. 

Edit: Thank you all very much for the info! I have a decent amount of weight coming, so I think I can afford to experiment with all the different ROAs, including just the traditional snort and see how it pans out. I do have a feeling that the majority of it will be going directly into my anus, though. I don't know why. It's just a strange hunch. Like a feeling you get in your gut...only it's in my anus.

Anyone know what panel test I'll be given? (e.g. 5-Panel, 9-Panel, 12-Panel, ect..) I'm wondering because I did some oxy a day ago before I knew about the test and I wanna know if I'm gonna be tested for it. I've been told the standard 5-Panel tests only look for morphine metabolites which only covers smack, morphine and codine which would put me in the clear with my oxy use. Any knowledge on the matter from my fellow bropiates? 

EDIT: Forgot to mention I was told it's a urine test, just not sure on how comprehensive a test it is. 

EDIT 2: Took the test, dont get results until tomorrow. The paper I got says the test done on me is '35190N SAP 10-50/2000 W/NIT' does anyone know what this tests for? I was told it's a 10-panel test. 

EDIT 3: so I found out the test looks for;
1. Amphetamine 
2. Cocaine 
3. Marijuana 
4. Opiates 
5. PCP 
6. Methamphetamine 
7. Barbiturates 
8. Benzodiazepines 
9. Methadone 
10. Propoxyphene

Propoxyphene isnt some crazy form of oxy or anything right? Oxy won't trip the opiate test because its not a morphine derivative but will it trip that last one??   ",1353380218.0

Prep: Did several washes, each time producing a dark, milky-yellow infusion.  Shook for about 2 minutes each time.  Each batch was an 8 oz bag; my friends each used one, I ended up using two.

Drinking the brew down wasn't too bad--we didn't use juice or anything, and it went down very easily.  After about twenty minutes, I started to feel a mild tingle and some sedation, and my face was flushed.  About half an hour in, I was definitely feeling it--it was a very mild high, but definitely noticeable.  Couldn't feel the cold, euphoric, noticeable histaminergic reaction.  After about 45 minutes, I washed another batch twice and took that over the next hour or so.  However, I noticed that after about two and a half hours after drinking the brew [about two hours of feeling delightful], the euphoria sharply dropped off.  It was still somewhat noticeable, but I could feel cold again.  I was still very pleasantly relaxed.  At this point we smoked some bud [I rarely smoked, so it was only about a hit]--of course, this brought the buzz back noticeably.  Interestingly, prior to smoking, none of our pupils were constricted; afterwards, our pupils were.

I would highly recommend this--the legs were a little bit of a bummer, but otherwise it was generally a pretty awesome experience.  Ten bucks, give or take, for a pretty solid buzz is, in my opinion, an amazing deal.

I'd been chipping for about a year, before I came into a sizable amount of pills rather cheaply. Now that I had a steady supply, I started about 3 weeks of constant use to the point that my friends expressed concern and strongly urged me to quit. I experienced my first ever withdrawal symptoms over the course of the next week; compared to some of the things you all have experienced this was probably nothing, but it was still a pretty big shock for me. It really shouldn't have been, but you just never see yourself over the course of a year going from picking up a few vics to full blown withdrawals. The funny thing is that going through withdrawals I didn't even swear off opiates forever. I remember explicitly telling my friends that I was quitting ""indefinitely"" just in case I felt like knocking back a few more pills at some point.

Anyways I quit for a month successfully until I just broke down. Over the course of the month I really tried my best to kind of brainwash myself into forgetting about opiates. I really tried my best to just be content with beer and cigarettes to relax, but at some point the whole thing just fell apart like a house of cards. 

The problem is that I'm not a different person than the person that was addicted to opiates in spite of my (futile) month long effort to change. Opiates are just such great antidepressants and anxiolytics that they really root themselves deep inside your brain at the base of your deepest, darkest fears and insecurities. Who here can't relate to becoming the person you want to be on opiates? That silent, confident energy is just simply unmatched. Of course nothing's free. Opiates just make you dead inside. You give away a part of yourself for that feeling, because you've just discovered the greatest thing in the world and who needs anything else? 

So by the end of even a few weeks opiates are no longer a nice addition to your day, you just fucking need them. You fucking need them to wake up, to go to work, to go to class, to go out on a Friday night. And you can pretty much fucking do this for as long as you have your medicine. Hell I'd be lying if I said that I wouldn't still be waking up and popping pills if my friends hadn't intervened. I mean this lifestyle isn't necessarily terrible. I felt good all the time and was the most productive I'd ever been in my life. The only trouble is that it's artificial and unsustainable. And of course on top of that it's simply insidious. I've done my fair share of drugs and opiates seem to be the one that I just can't drop. I wouldn't even be surprised if I started slamming H although I'm never planning on starting (but don't we all know how that goes?). I'm doing the best I can to stay away, but it's just fucking uphill all the way. To the people that have been through this before, does it ever get any better?

A little background: I've been using opis(hydro and oxy) on and off for the past 4 years. I've never been addicted really, since i've never had withdrawls and never done opi's for longer than like 5 days straight. The highest i've ever dosed to nod was 70mg. 

I've always had a problem re-dosing though.

Example: I take 40mg oxy at noon. Feel great, nod a little. Wears off around 2:30-3. I want to have the same feeling, so at 10pm I take 60mg. I feel 1/5th of what I did from the 40 earlier. 

However, if I took 40mg at noon the same day, and then dosed at noon the next day at 40mg, i'd still feel great.

Anyone else have this problem of hardly feeling shit, even when you up the dose on the same day? Sorry if i'm confusing i'm a little high.

I was suffering from some pretty bad depression and anxiety that my ""normal"" medication just wasn't touching, so I was like fuck it, I just want to feel *good*. This, of course, violated a rule I made for myself years ago - don't do drugs unless you're in tippy top mental shape. 

But I digress. So I've been on this road trip vacation since Saturday, driving for 8 hours each day and sleeping in hotel rooms. It's actually been a lot of fun, but I've had to ration out the small amount of dope I brought with me in order to enjoy myself the most. Until ALL OF IT SPILLED OUT IN MY BAG (it was tar in liquid form). FFFFFFFF.

There's no way I can cop in these unfamiliar locales. Even if I felt comfortable doing so (which I don't, as a tiny naive suburban white girl) the person I'm with doesn't know I'm using and would absolutely freak out if he did. I've been feeling like shit, nothing like the withdrawal symptoms I've seen others experience, but just anxious, depressed, irritable, achey, pukey, and that godawful runny nose. It SUCKS being trapped in a cramped car all day feeling like this and not being able to tell my boyfriend I'm going through heroin withdrawal and don't really have the energy to explore the world's largest ball of twine or whatever.

However, while I think this can be well-meaning, it's often misguided.

Addiction is fluid, and believe it or not, not an actual diagnosis.  ""Addict"" is a pejorative term and one used as an identity for recovering addicts.  Professionals speak in term of Dependence and Abuse, which I believe are more helpful terms, and can co occur but do not necessarily.

Someone who abuses a drug is someone who spends a great deal of time acquiring or recovering from the drug, uses the drug in dangerous situations, and/or uses drugs despite negative effects to social or vocational [school/work] life.  Someone who abuses drugs can have a few or all of these qualities.

Dependence, however, is a much more stringent criteria.  Dependence implies a cycle of using increasing amounts of a drug to get the same effect [or using the same amount and getting no effect], trying to quit the drug, experiencing withdrawals, and then increasing drug-seeking behavior to avoid withdrawals.

Obviously, these criteria are not all inclusive.  They don't necessarily catch the dependent user who never tries to quit and only uses medication as prescribed, or adequately describe it.  However, I think these terms are more useful than making a blanket statement that someone is an ""addict.""

Now, since I work in the mental health profession, this is a bit of a pet peeve of mine--and maybe you all don't really care about the distinction between abuse and dependence, addicts and junkies.  But I think there are a lot of really common misconceptions about addiction, and if we ever want to see an end to the stigma of opiate and drug use, we as a community at least need to start using less stigmatizing language.",1353628582.0

I've really just put up with it but at times it hurt so much I almost went to the hospital. Currently my drug is heroin and my ROA is sniffing if it matters. I'm male,in pretty decent health and haven't ate anything that would really be gas inducing more than usual. I don't get gas usually, if I do I pass it. the pain is located center of my abdomen. I get some relief from pepcid and tums and gasx but nothing really works. I usually finally get relief after I have a bowel movement and it is loose. I don't experience WD symptoms only this once in a while after I use. I know that this could be considered a WD symptom but I don't mean I'm WDing in the normal sense, I don't use regularly enough and often go a few days with no problem. It is always not every time after use. I've read some stuff on the sidebar and I'm considering the grapefruit juice thing before I use. Does anyone experience something similar, I'd feel so much better because I swear I am alone. Also sometimes it can hurt so bad. thanks for light shed, much appreciated guys. I've read the sidebar and didn't see anything like this and have searched the net with no luck. I've been using for 7 years and been dealing with this pain whenever it chooses to come by. Is it just a side effect of the diarrhea I get after use sometimes? Any one get something like this??",1353748375.0

Now we all know that the most morphine you can get into 1 ml of water is 60 mg, and we're talking best case situation here. That being said, I usually use four 60 mg MSIRs (with 350 units of water) or two 100 mg MSContin (with 130 units of water) per cook. After repeated washes, I end up with four shots with decreasing degrees of morphine in each one. I have that shit down to a science.

If I increase the number of pills (and units of water) up to ten MSIR 30s or 5 MSContin 100s, I obviously get stronger and more shots.

So my question to you guys is... What do you think the optimal number of pills to units of water ratio is? Do you just use one pill and 100 units of water (and pull up one shot) like my girl thinks is best, or do you do like I do and use a handful of pills and a few rigs worth of water (and end up with four or five rigs)?

Thanks for looking, and I hope you all get where you want to be.

**TL;DR - What is the optimal ratio of pills to water?**

Well anyway, I've been friends with this girl for a couple years now. I met her freshman year of college and got in the friendzone really deep, all of sophomore year I stayed friends with her, and was thoroughly depressed because she only wanted to be friends. I had been using opiates since I was 15, but it was during this period sophomore year that I first started using with any sort of regularity, and I started using harder opiates (instead of oxy and hydrocodone I was fucking with heroin, opana, and hydromorphone)..

well anyway, I ended (stupidly) signing a lease to live with this girl for junior year (which is this year) so I'm living with her now. She ended up getting back together with her freshman year boyfriend over the summer, which has been pretty hard for me to deal with. Anyway, I've been using any opiates I can lately, ended up using daily for a few weeks (and I'm currently still using daily, although the only opiates I can get are poppy seeds to make tea-- but I've got plenty of them)..

Anyway, I was home for thanksgiving break and during this time I was away from the girl, and really trying to reflect on my life and get shit figured out. I ended up tripping solo and came to terms with a lot of shit, I was planning on coming back to school and apologizing to the girl for a lot of shit I had put her through that was a result of me being addicted/ fucked up..

Anyway, after that I was enjoying break, seeing a lot of friends for the first time in a long time. I wanted to show them that I was a good friend, since I had turned my back on a lot of people while chasing this girl, and I wanted to make it clear that I still cared about them. I was meeting up with a few of these friends (one of them for the very first time) when the girl calls me sobbing, saying she needs me, that she found out she's pregnant, and that she doesn't ever want to see her boyfriend again. 

So I decide she really needs me, tell all my friends ""Sorry, I can't tell you why I'm leaving, but I gotta go back to college, like RIGHT NOW"" and just left. I feel really bad about this, but I thought I had to do it, that she really needed me. Anyway, I speed home, pack up all my shit really quick, and despite being high on PST I hopped in my car and fucking drove like a madman back to school. I made the 7 hour drive in less 6 hours, I think my average speed was like 80mph.

Anyway, I get here, and she wouldn't even talk to me. She was acting like everything was fine at first, just all jolly and shit. So I finally got her aside and tried to talk to her, and all she said was ""I've got nothing to say to you."" and walks away, and goes about shit like nothing even happened. So at first I get really pissed, and break down in my room crying and shit. I realized I made such a mistake just leaving and coming here..

anyway, I tried to look past it. My other friend took my aside and explained to me ""you just being here is supporting her, she might not need you now but the fact that you're here matters, and she WILL need us to get through this."" so I kinda over looked what had happened as best I could.. but then this morning she ended up calling her boyfriend, and despite all of us telling her not to, despite the fact that she admits its detrimental to her life, she got back together with him. She still hasn't even said a word to me about the pregnancy since she first called me crying, and now I'm just sitting in my room alone while she's out with her boyfriend. 

I should be home with my friends who actually care about me, showing them I care about them. Instead I'm here, crying alone in my room. I wanna just keep making batch after batch of PST until I pass out and never wake up. I feel like such an idiot, I feel physical pain I feel so depressed right now... ugh.. not like I'm actually gunna try and kill myself right now, mainly because that would be the worst thing ever to my friends who DO care about me. I just want to not feel this pain right now.

I don't even know what I want to hear right now.. I just need someone to tell me something, I dunno. I feel so fucking fucked.

So I'm in classes now to get a certificate in a course that involves a lot of blood drawing. Although we have fake arms and hands to practice off of, they prefer that us students practice off of one another. Unnfortunately, I've been badly addicted to heroin off and on for the past 4 or 5 years and my veins are pretty shitty because of it. The way I do heroin is through IV, therefore my veins are pretty messed up, especially the ones they like to use at doctor's offices, and the ones they want the other students to draw off of. My veins have been so stubborn at points that I've actually been hospitalized and I've had to have IV's put in my neck instead of the normal places. 

Anyways, since my fellow students are only able to get blood off of me a small percentage of the time i'm starting to think they're catching on. Not only that, but since they're students and they don't know what the hell they're doing i'm severely worried about them screwing up what good ""normal"" veins I have. Therefore, I want to see if I can somehow get permission to draw blood off of others, but to not have them drawn off of me.

I was thinking of going and telling the teacher, but obviously a lot of folks are very biased towards the addict community, and I don't want me doing that to screw up a future job reference, or worse- have her kick me out of the course. I've been telling her that I have hard to draw out of veins, but I still don't tink she gets the hint that I don't want the students messing with me.

Another option is to go to my general practitioner. I've been seeing him for years, and he knows good and well about my problem with heroin//speedballing. What i'm hoping he might do is write a note to my teacher saying something along the lines of ""due to your student's fragile veins I do not want anyone drawing off of her, only her drawing off of them"" or whatever. ... But then i'm wondering if he'll even do that, and if he does will it be fair to the other students who have to be poked with needles?? <shrugs>

I need some suggestions here. What do you think I should do- 1) tell the teacher the truth? 2- Have my doctor write a note? or 3- Have the shitty kids keep attempting to draw out of me until they give up?

Hes never truely fucked me, but every time I have to go through him its always your typical ""waiting game"" bull shit.  Always in the back of my mind feel like I'm gonna get fucked.  He also never feeds me truthful answers, always oh I'm waiting on this or that and its just a load of crap, hes bojangling half the time.  Low and behold /angry that I won't be getting mine tonight.  Have to go through the trouble of recouping my money tomorrow to go through my dude when it comes in.

Anyone have any bullshit stories they'd like to share?",1353981557.0

I last around 10 minutes then and it's almost as if I can't even have fun with it because I'm always trying not to bust a nut. I've heard SSRI's can do the same thing for this. I have a fuck ton of these things laying around and was wondering if taking 100mg of welbutrin (bupropion?) will allow me to have the same awesome sex that I do on opiates.

Last time I was using heavily in like 05-06 I ended up going to a methadone clinic for a few years and stopped using dope. This time I was doing okay using once a week or every few days but of course I'm back to using everyday again. I start feeling anxious and not good like 12 hours after using and I can't really make it even 24 hours. Luckily I've had the money and dope is available but I'm sure that won't always be the case.

So my first option that would allow me to avoid anyone knowing is to try to taper down a bit myself. Honestly I can't see myself going cold turkey so I was thinking of trying to use the bare minimum when I start feeling sick. Will this actually lower my tolerance though? I'm not quite sure I have the willpower to actually do this but would it actually work or is dope just too strong to come off of slowly without really being sick?

Last option for now would be finding a suboxone doctor. The clinic I went to had subs too but you have to go every morning and that's not really possible right now. I figure a sub doctor might be expensive though and while I am on my parents insurance right now I really don't want to get them involved unless absolutely necessary. Anyone have any experience here? Everyone knew when I was on methadone but would it be possible to go to a doctor and get subs, pick them up and pay out of pocket without anyone knowing? Anyone know average pricing for sub doctor and pharmacy if I didn't use insurance?

Hope it helps! ","I very much enjoy opiates, but in no way am I a heavy user of them.  I don't consider myself and addict and I usually stick to oxy and hydros.  Now, if you are someone new to the pill scene and just want to enjoy some good old fashioned nodding, steer clear of Tylenon 3's.  T3's contain 30mg's of codeine and 300mg's of tylenol.  Yes, they may be easy to get and seem like a good place to start, but trust me, do not!  I have tried T3's on many different occasions with different tolerance levels and to put it bluntly, all the experiences have been shit.  Even when I had barely any tolerance, the T3's did almost nothing.  No nodding or euphoria at all.  All they did was make things seem a little slower.  Also, they make you feel terrible: bad stomach cramps, itching, grogginess, constipation, and trouble falling asleep.  I apologize if I have offended any T3 lovers but I am just trying to help.  So, if you are looking to start taking pills and want a good euphoric high, find some 5/500 or 7.5/750 hydrocodones.  These are great pills to start with and I still love to use them occasionally.

WTF happened? ,"So, I have used opiates off and on for the past 5-6 years of my life with highly varying frequencies. I've used it all from Tylenol-3's to diesel, and was always very self conscious about usage patterns in order to avoid any physical dependency and withdrawals (at least significant ones that is). I hardly ever binge, and stuck to using opiates once a month for the majority of this 5-6 year period. My most recent binge was 5 day run with dope (mostly dosing in the evenings and only one day during the day), which left me feeling just a little crummy and bummy the following day, but nothing serious. Very mild diarrhea and depression of mood. 

Fast forward - This past month I had been indulging in paregoric (tincture of opium, so full alkaloid spectrum equivalent to 60mg of morphine at my dosage), as well as some pods, and some methadone a week before everything else. Anyways, I was using off and on, ""chipping"" as I saw it, for a this month and had been feeling perfectly fine. Until this past Monday...

I hadn't taken any opiates in 4-5 days when I indulged in a drug by the name of viminol, which I had never tried before. Prior to the viminol, I took a dose (75mg morphine equivalent) of paregoric, like I said, 4-5 days earlier with nothing in between (except a dose of Ketamine). 

Now, I took this shit with a potentiater and was impressed to say the least. Nice, euphoric high that lasted a while. So I did a three day binge. Just three doses over three days though, only at night, usually ending in a nice nod. 

Fast forward to monday morning and I'm in pain - cold sweats, stomach cramping, pupils dilated, diarrhea, extreme restlessness and agitation. I thought to myself, now why the fuck would this, after 5 days of being clean, suddenly throw me into WD's? 

Well it was my first experience with the WD's and they were upsetting to say the least. They peaked on Tuesday night with me curled in the fetal position in the shower and crying (I'm a grown man btw) for what felt like quite a long time. That being said, I'm sure my WD would be a walk in the park for most of you - I had no vomiting, so severe pain. The worse symptom overall for me was the insomnia and extreme restlessness in my muscles. 

So, what the fuck happened? I mean, if I had such a habit that would induce WD's, then why would I not have felt them in the 4-5 days after my last dose of paregoric and before the viminol? 

My only theory is that in the past I had always experienced a gradual, very mild comedown or WD from opiates, but the viminol invoked a precipitated withdrawal. Check out the wikipedia entry and you'll see it's a racemic with both agonist and antagonist properties (much like suboxone). My thought is that once the agonists checked out late Sunday night, the antagonists went to work stripping my receptors clean, essentially shoving me over the cliff instead of a slow hike back down. 

I'm feeling better know, but don't know what to think. My girlfriend is upset with me because she had always trusted me to be moderate, and avoid this shit, and thankfully, for the past 5 years I have. So it's either a.) No, no I can not 'chip' ; or b.) I picked the wrong novelty opiate to take a weekender binge with. 

To make matters worse, my WD symptoms have all but vanished as of now (4 days later) and I just received a gift of a half g of fire from a friend and I'm not sure what to do. Will a short H session (I don't IV, only did it once to try it and I liked it too much) tonight spit me right back to square one with the WDs? Even if I only dose tonight and don't redose for another 72 hrs? 

Advice would be much appreciated from the vets here. 

Much love to everyone and best wishes. 

TL;DR - Experienced my first withdrawals, but doesn't make sense why. Also curious how long to wait after WD's to attempt to renter the chip? ",1354227002.0

I was high as shit, nodding like a mother fucker and my friend insisted I come back to her dorm because she was worried about me. I said nah I'm fine, I've done this however many times, chill out. She is persistent, so I go. I sit on her bed, she goes to sleep, I planned on leaving but guess I passed out. I woke up in the middle of the night on my side. As if I passed out sitting up and slumped to my side. Sometime in the night I threw up but since I was on my side I didn't choke on it. I woke up like, oh shit, bounced (naturally) and it didn't real sit in with me for a a bit and when I started doing dope and getting addicted. Looking back though I realize how lucky I was and how what I do is playing with fire, every time.

Summer of 2011 I got my wisdom teeth removed and got prescribed percocet 5/325s. I got high off it for the first time with just two. I kept on geeting high off of them like once every week and increasing the amount of pills to get high because my tolerance built up. About a month later I finished off those pills with my tolerance high enough that I took 7 pills to get high. I had honestly a really awesome time chilling out high off percocet. I felt really fucking good while on it like it was the best I've ever felt. It was probably my favorite drug I've ever taken (Only other drugs I've taken are alcohol, weed, ecstasy, and lsd.)

Fast forward to this november where I bought alot of percocets off of my friend. The first time I've done it since was over Thanksgiving break. I took five pills which got me pretty high. I just did them again tonight taking 8 pills which I got really high. But the thing is these past two times I did it I didn't enjoy them nearly as much as when I did that one summer. Like I got pretty high these both times but I didn't feel as happy or relaxed as I once did and the high didn't last as long as it once did. Like I still felt the effects pretty fucking strongly but I still didn't feel as happy. Is there something wrong with me or am I not just doing enough because I still pretty fucking high but I wasn't like feeling that amazing emotional feeling I once did.

So my question is that is there something wrong with me or am I just not doing enough. Like one thing that's different now is that I'm on SSRIs that I wasn't on that one summer. The weird thing is I don't have any emotional problems or anything I was just put on these due to a long history of post concussion syndrome and I was put on just to try it out since everything else to treat my post concussion syndrome has been tried out.",1354349705.0

I have a real injury and as a result I was previously given oxycodone and now once more. Both times in 5 mg pill form. I've had some fun but haven't really figured them out.

But my question is about snorting my script. The pills are in pressed form, a white powder. I occassionly mix things up by crushing and snorting a pill or two in a session. But am I just getting binder in my nose? I mean, 5 mg seems pretty small compared to the pill dosages I've heard of.


I think I've felt a kick from the nose before, maybe. I've definitely made myself sick once or twice, but nothing serious as my dosages were small and slowly upped.

My Background: I have used almost all opiates through pretty much every route of administration (except IV), once had a tolerance of around 120mg of oxycodone (result of 3 months of continued use, and then i weaned off through subs) but have currently not used any opiate in 4 months.

Question: I will be home and capable of getting my hands on some 30mg IR oxys soon, and I have always been interested in IV usage. Is it safe and possible to IV a roxi after using again for only a couple of days and with a low tolerance (i am assuming my toly will be around 15-30mg once i jump in again), will the rush and high be a good example of IV usage of opiates since my tolerance will be low? Most importantly, what should my IV dose be relative to oral/insufflation dose? 

People who will advise against it: I know IV can change the whole ballgame- I know my addict brain, I also am only home for a week, then back to school where I don't interact with anyone who uses opiates, have a source for getting any opiates, and never use any opiates, school prevents me from being bored and falling into it. If anything the only reason I want to try IV now is because of these limits. I enjoy sober living, but I also enjoy the opiate outlet, and am very interested in the IV experience.

Unfortunately, I have never felt that I had the freedom to be honest with him about my opiate use, and later, addiction, because a) I was concerned he would stop prescribing me the adderall and klonopin, which I very much need, because they have potential for abuse, b) while opiate use is almost always due to an underlying problem, those very problems (depression, etc.) are what I discuss with him anyway, so I do/did not feel it necessary to tell him that very specific piece of the puzzle, c) I do not want to lose the trust we've built up, although, admittedly, maybe that's what I deserve, and d) I do not want a drug seeker stamp in my medical records that would follow me for the rest of my life. I've heard some real horror stories on this front. 

It should be noted that I have *never* abused the adderall or klonopin. I take it more or less as prescribed. Frankly, I hate taking the addy because I associate it with work/studying in a Pavlovian way. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the kpins, but I would rather enjoy/appreciate their medical benefits as prescribed every day than binge and run out early. I've rarely if ever felt the desire to take more than my 2 mg dose. In general I am meant to take it either before going to bed (lying in the dark staring at the ceiling is when my mind starts racing and I get anxious the most, my insomnia was even worse before klonopin) or when I experience a panic attack. I have rarely if ever used it in any other situation. I do not subscribe to the NA theory that an addict is an addict is an addict and that using any psychoactive substance inevitably leads back to your DOC. My problem is with opiates and opiates alone. This is not to say I have a problem with AA/NA, it works for a lot of people, and more power to them, but it's just not for me. It will become clear why all this is relevant, I promise. 

Meanwhile, I am considering getting into a suboxone maintenance program here in PA. I am a highly functioning addict - part time job, internship, 3.7 GPA, so I would not say that my life has become unmanageable... yet. I want to get on subs to prevent getting to that ""yet"" and because my habit is obviously a huge financial burden. Plus I will be graduating in the spring, and I would like to have this monkey off my back (for lack of a better cliche) before I go into the real world and need to be 100% independent. 

I do not want my family to know about my opiate addiction or if I get on suboxone. I know they would be supportive as they always have been, but despite my many successes I have felt that I've failed or disappointed them in the past and I don't want to put them to through it again. They love me unconditionally, which is why them finding out what a secret fuck up I am would be even more painful/guilt wreaking. Likewise I would not want my shrink to know for all the reasons I outlined earlier. As such, I wouldn't use my insurance (still on my family plan) if I got on suboxone. Straight cash, homie. 

The sub clinic was recommended to me by the head honcho of my local needle exchange, who said you go once a week and get your scrip for that week, in and out in 15 minutes. Based on that they seem pretty laid back, but I won't know for sure until I call in the morning. When I'm talking to them about the program I could ask if they do drug testing. If they don't, should I not tell them about my adderall/klonopin prescriptions or just be upfront regardless? I'm leaning towards the latter. And If they do test, I will have no choice but to be honest, which means I have to hope they are cool with my taking those medication. Because at this point if they aren't I would rather continue down the path I'm on until I find another/the right way to quit. Both because keeping those scrips is more important to me than getting on sub maintenance right this minute and because even if I did want to choose the subs over the others, it would mean my psychiatrist finding out since he's not going to just let me stop taking those meds without giving a reason. Lies of omission are enough, I don't want to get into flat out lies. Backtracking a little bit, is it a bad idea to ask about drug testing at all? Would that give them the impression that I am going to try to keep using or pull a fast one? And if so, would that impression stick even after I explain why I asked (my prescription meds)? I guess I could just bring up the meds first since I've pretty much decided on honesty, nothing really to lose by being straight up with them. If they say they don't allow patients to take meds like that I say thanks anyway and hang up. 

So my main question is this: if the sub clinic will allow me to keep taking my addy/kpin and I get involved in their program, will my psychiatrist be able to find out I am taking suboxone? Again, I'll be paying for both the sub appointments and prescriptions with cash, keeping the insurance company completely uninvolved and I'd fill it at a small mom and pop pharmacy that I've never used before and thus doesn't have any of my info on record. If he *can* find out, what is the likelihood of him actually doing so given that it's two different states, I'm not using insurance, I'm using a new pharmacy, and he's an old dude with questionable aptitude for technology? If he can't, would the clinic tell him/would I be doing anything illegal? I don't think it's doctor shopping or anything, since I'm not getting multiple scrips for the same/similar drugs. I'm just not sure if doctor patient confidentiality applies to other doctors, especially given all these electronic prescription databases that have become the norm of late. Furthermore, would my parents have any way of finding out even though I'll eschew their insurance? 

I know the easy answer to all this is just be honest with everyone, make quitting opiates/getting on subs my first priority, etc. But as I said I've managed to maintain a high degree of success/functionality despite my heavy opiate use. So at the same time it would be kind of backwards and silly to risk both my grades and mental health slipping (absent the adderall and klonopin) in my last semester of college and into the job search because I *quit* heroin. The point may come where the necessity of getting clean outweighs potentially losing my meds, the shame I'd feel from having my family find out, etc. But I'm not there yet, so it'll either be this or continuing to use until I either reach that point or find some other way to quit independently of any program/maintenance. One of the many ironies here is that my shrink is actually licensed to prescribe suboxone. So I won't have much trouble finding a sub doc if the time comes that I need to put my cards on the table. 

To those who made it all the way through and especially those who leave helpful comments, thank you very much in advance.

TL;DR: If I started seeing a suboxone doctor in Pennsylvania, pay for it out of pocket (no insurance involved whatsoever), and get my prescriptions filled at a mom and pop pharmacy with no previous record of any kind on me, would my psychiatrist and/or family in New York find out somehow?

So my friend claims he wants ""one last hurrah,"" and wants to go score a half gram or something and get high. He asked me if it was possible. 
I told him ""one last time"" is never really one last time and he should just stick to the 'done. He got super snippy and said that wasn't what he meant. He wants to know if he'd be wasting his money if he bought dope. I've never been on MMT, so I thought I'd come to this lovely subreddit and see if anyone had any insight.


He started at an induction dose of 30mgs on Monday and has been increased to his maintenance dose bit by bit, putting him at 55mgs as of today, where he'll be staying. He doses at noon every day. Apparently he doesn't get held accountable for dirty urines for the next couple weeks.

So what do y'all know? I told him to be super careful about the increased risk of OD and that I thought he was stupid to mix anything with methadone. Is he just blowing his money and risking death, or is it actually possible to get high while on methadone?



<b>TL;DR</b>  Can someone who has been taking ~50mgs of methadone for less than a week feel it if they use heroin, or will the methadone block the high?",1354835388.0

I am a firm believer that nothing can curb the odds for or against except for cold, calculated science. Now I have been taking it easy, just sub'n for the past few days, planning on not doing anything until around Christmas when I can be back in the NY/CT area and party with some old boys. Well, today after work I hopped on the bus back to my downtown apartment and noticed in the seat next to me was a little pile of around ten cents in pennies. All of them were Lincoln-side down except for one. 

I figured, well fuck, if any penny is ever going to be lucky - this one would be it (not that I believe luck exists at all).. I pick it up,because, fuck it, why not? Leaving the rest to chill on the seat that I discovered them on. So, since I've vowed not to **spend money** on any opiates until around Christmas, I get home feeling a tiny bit under the weather. Mind you I only take <1mg of sub to maintain. I get home and take .3mg of clonidine, which in my opinion is a **must-have** for a sub taper, or any opiate taper for that matter. 

Now .3 usually gets me to that, ""oh shit I feel like I can't move and I'm just gonna fall asleep with all my clothes on right now"" type of feeling, and just as I settle into a position I feel like falling asleep in - my cell rings. ""Hello?"" I say in a drowsy tone to my boy, ""Yo bro I'm lookin' for a bun"" my buddy says. ""Well did you hit up the usual people?"" (I'm not really one to middle-man too much and generally hook most of my **close** boys up with my connects (if I didn't, when I moved out of CT, all those lads would be sober haha), ""Yeah most aren't answering and T's dicking me around, if you can get me one I'll throw you a bag"". ""OK, let me see I'll call you back"". Sure enough the first person I call tells me they're just about to head out to do the same and to meet me down by the mall and we'll roll out together. 

So I do the deed for my boy and he throws me one of the best Chanel bags that I've seen in a while, these are stamped in black ink and are of decent size compared the last couple batches I've had.. Surprisingly, even though I did <1mg of bupe at around 6am this morning, I'm catching a nod and rambling on for far too long about how I'm wondering if the only reason this happened is because I picked up a penny - heads up, in a pile of face down pennies... 

Sorry guys, I'm an idiot and did too much clonidine in too short an amount of time. But here's what 'lady luck', who I still really don't believe in, and much to the contrary think I'm just an idiot junky with the right connection at the right time, has bestowed upon me.. Goodnight you princes of pain, you kings of opiates..

Because lately after a few hours of stabbing I keep giving up and either plugging or muscling my ridiculous number of shots. While it gets me well, it satisfies neither my needle fetish (don't you just love that nice red flash of a solid, A+ register?) or (more importantly) my desire to get a rush or be high.

First, it’s been a good, twisted, self-destructive run. We all have more in common than we otherwise would. Sadly, it’s time for me to get the fucking move on. I’ve been encapsulated by the opiate womb coma for four years. I owe it to my ~~family~~  myself to see the rest of this decade of my life through with conviction and a strive toward some, any form of clarity and purpose. I will not forget from where I came or the people I befriended along the way. I’ve met a great number of people who I hold in high regard. This is not a dismissal on The Life, this is merely my independent exit from it. I wish you all safety and fruitful pursuits.

My quit date was Nov. 27, 2012. I had been living by myself in NC for a while and had cultivated potent sources and co-users down there along with a growing disregard for safety which caused me to liberally use the Road for more exotic chemicals. I had been using intravenously for the past month or more, can’t really place it. At the end I was my drug dealers’ favorite customer, creditors’ worst nightmare, and all around self-absorbed, righteous dickhead.

It all came to a head over thanksgiving break, I was driving up to NE for the holidays. Usually the ride is a ball buster: on the road at 7 a.m and drive up through Richmond, DC, Maryland, Delaware, NJPike, NYC and Connecticut. If you play your cards right and take minimal stops it can be done in 11 hours. This time around I didn’t hit the road until 1p.m because I wanted to make sure I was stocked: Gram and a half of dope and all the consumables, 250mls of liquid Xanax (.5mgs per drop), THC Jolly Ranchers and a carton of cigarettes. Hit the road running.  I am not proud of this. 

The ride went as usual, through Raleigh up 85 to Richmond—call my connect in the hood there for coke, no dice—don’t even stop for a piss break. At this point I must have started to really feel my own doped outness, I ended up pulling over and getting a hotel in Fredricksburg, Va just shy of DC. Figured I’d throw it on the company card and enjoy myself. Countless shots and drops later, dinner at Hooters next to the hotel where I was a complete zombie I almost passed out. Back in the room was a little video chat with some other bropiates and sleep.  Wakeup call for 9a.m, drop drop, shot, shower, candy, check-out, hit the road. 

I blew through DC by the Pentagon, Capitol Building and everything else with little traffic. Up through Maryland and Delaware, call fellow bropiate in Philly, sure I can take a little detour to the city. Took the 2 hour detour to pick him up, we go and score, fix on top of all I had been doing that day. Shit I’ve got a headache and fever. Drive him home, dose with a couple drops of the Xanax and I’m on my merry way again. By the time I cleared the city and airport the headache had set in. Had I caught cotton fever for the second time in two weeks? Pull off highway before hitting the NJ turnpike, check into a hotel with my own money this time, the bean counters knew I had made one night stop, no need to let them know I had to take two, especially so far off course.

In the hotel room I hooked up the laptop, log in, went on Tinychat to shoot the shit again, showed off my newly acquired dope on top of everything else that was beginning to look quite spent and fix. Did a shot to subside the shivering at this point. Yep, pretty sure it’s the fever. I was able to sleep through it, however, magic.

10 a.m wakeup call, close enough to home, within striking distance. Drop, drop, shot, shower, candy, check-out, and I was back on the open road. Xanax was having a weird effect on me. I had never really fucked with the awful stuff in the past, it seemed to stretch my vocal cords, voice began to have a reverberation even I in my state could hear. Blew through NJ Turnpike with the easy pass mounted on my dash, to be honest I don’t even remember that part. I start moving in and out of remembering. No recollection of passing Newark airport, George Washington Bridge in NYC, or NYC skyline. 

Finally in Ct, almost home up through  Stamford, Bridgeport, Hartford; can finally re-up on cheap bundles and white there, going out tonight boozing, hitting on girls fucked out of our minds, going to be a good night.

Crash.

Didn’t even make it through Greenwich, just shy of Stamford. I rear end a family in the passing lane because I was mixing up a shot in a Gatorade cap. Pullover into the left breakdown lane, WTF. Get out to see they are OK. Their small Jetta’s truck is crumpled and my cars front end is pretty fucked but still drivable. FUCK. Bum the guy a smoke, I’m going nuts making sure their infant in the back seat is OK.
Cops show up. Get the grill down by them, getting all my info together. Cleaning everything in my car up, caps, cottons, needles, two different kinds of dope, coke, Xanax dropper into one of the many bags in my backseat in an incredibly calm manner. Cover up my forearms that are an absolute travesty of track marks. Kind of blank out after that, I was sitting in the driver seat, windows down at rush-hour in the left breakdown lane.

 Cop comes back to the window, “You realize your license is suspended?” Nope. Unpaid ticket, FUCK. “Are you on anything, son?” Fuck, must have seen my DUI from when I was 18. “Nope, officer.” Straight  stare back at him, turn intensity up to a 7. Damn, it always amazed me how unnoticeable to non-users opiate user are. Tow truck pulls up in back, FUCK. 

Now at this point you may be thinking, alright that’s quite a scare, you almost killed a family, if the cop searched your car you were looking at felony possession, if he blood tested or even sobriety tested you it would be instant DUI. Yeah, you would think. Get picked up from a friend at the Stamford train station, luggage and drugs in tow. Wallet lost in the mix-up. Home by 10pm, everyone is asleep thankfully. Safe.

The next couple of days were spent working, grabbin’ dope during work from my plentiful connects. 25$ blues, 45$ bundles, 150$ balls of that white girl, good to be home. One of those days my go-to wasn’t picking up and I was completely out. Brute force through work with a couple bags. Out at 3. Drive down to the hood, usual corners are empty, what the FUCK. Alright, time to be industrious. Park the car, hit the block. The only white dude in a sea of Hispanics and blacks, don’t give a fuck. Everyone has a comment, everyone’s a comedian. End up talking to some Puerto Rican in Spanish, “Que necessitas, hefe?” Bundles. “Vamos.” Follow him around the corner, through some buildings passing a couple of less than savory looking motherfuckers. Up a steel staircase, bang bang, some word in Spanish I couldn’t keep up with. A response from within, Valle. Door swings open, step inside. Four or five big ‘Ricans standing around an otherwise deserted, linoleum floored entryway. A tirade of questions in Spanish, my second language skills are not up to snuff so I just start talking in English. “Two bundles, 20 of coke, what else you got?” Get my shit, for the first time they address me in English, “Make sure you hide that good, pendejo. Bike cops.” Right, start putting in an upper inner pocket. “No, not good enough.” Well alright. Toss my introduction a bag for his trouble, nut the lot. Jesus, where the fuck was I and what kind of calculations had I placed or failed to even register. Notice the dudes I’d just given $120 before bursting back into the stairwell are strapped to the gills, all of them. I am not a smart man.  Walking back to my car I get a text from my previously absent hook, “You good?”

….
Cold turkey. Haven’t taken a break, never mind quit without some subs in over 3 years. The doc at the ER was a surprisingly well humored, I presume gay, polish guy with slim fitting clothes from what looked like Express and a ponytail pulling his hair and face into a tight squint. “I hear someone’s been a naughty boy.” I look up from the hospital bed with my mother and sister at my side. “Can’t argue there, been firing dope into my veins.” He laughs gets on his haunches and begins to break down my options. He somehow convinced my mother, father, sister and even me that I was strong enough to kick at home. “The brain is 100% chemistry. I know hundreds of junkies who have kicked thousands of times. You’ve done it before, you know you can do this.”  Since I had done it before and since I was approaching 24 hours with no outwards signs of withdrawal, probably the Xanax’s long half-life still in my system, I agreed.  I was held in the ER for 5 hours among the cracked out and toothless of Hartford’s strung-out. I left that night with a script for something to take care of stomach issues and Ibuprofen. Fucking cold turkey from a .5 gram/bundle a day IV habit never mind what else I could get on top of that. 11.27.12 
As anyone else in the situation I stocked up with the usual over the counter meds in a fleeting attempt at making the next week bearable, lope, Nyquil, Gatorade, Tylenol pm, more lope, Sudafed and a host of melatonin, and hydroxy-tryptaphan.  Not that any of that could touch the internal torment I went through for the next 8 days. I was stuck in a weird form of purgatory, disgustingly tired without a hope in the world of sleeping, the strength of a man with nothing but bile in his stomach and a central nervous system so fried that normal human function was not possible.
10 days into the detox I still hadn’t slept for more than 5 minutes consecutively, I lost pretty much all of my reserve body fat but was up to a rate of reading more ferocious than during my college days or any time before. Although miserable and disconcerting in process, that lack of mind altering substances, which my mind had not experienced since 15 years of age, a strange clearness opened up.
….

TLDR; I'm done guys, be safe. End rant. 

I obviously cut the story short when I realized I was over 2000 words, if you would like to hear how I came to break down and tell my family everything and the aftermath I will. Probably won't be lurking too much anymore.

HIGH Usage leading up to stoppage:  

2-3 Days of Methadone -60mg or needed dosage (Best transition into subs)  After last dose typically at least 24 hours before using subs for me.
Then
up to 21 Days of Subs -  Start at Max 4mg.. progress down to .3 or hopefully less before fully stopping (Dont ever want to do longer then 21 days)
Then
4 Days of Kratom (Nice buffer leading into full stoppage, but not needed)

(I can typically take a sub 12 hours after doing H, and 24 hours after methadone, but its up to your body)

Typically only need 4-7 Days of Subs from 2mg-1mg down to .3 within the time frame.

I inquired as to how much and how long he was taking them and he told me for three weeks he took six 80's a day orally. As three doses of 160. He also said that's what they started him on and he said he never got sick even at the beginning. Is this possible for an opiate naive individual? Off no tolerance I am 100% going to be sick if I eat 15mg he says he took over ten times that! Does being in bad pain increase your tolerance enough for that?,1355125623.0

I am a long time lurker, just recently I started to post comments to people's threads, mostly to provide insight.  I have been using opiates for a few years, started chipping, with a real ""control"" over things.  Until I discovered the wonderful Opana, and realized I could be high all the time, for not too much $$.  Then the formula was changed and resulted in me returning back to shitty OP's and blue guys(don't get me wrong oxy is a wonderful high, just too costly IMO.  Sorry for the rant, but I wanted to give a little background for the upcoming questions.  A few months ago H found me and ever since I have become a loyal supporter, mostly because its cost effective, although I don't like not knowing what you are getting 100%.   

Finally on to the topic of the post!! I recently came into possession of one 70ug Mylan patch.  The packaging that it came in was mostly beat up, which had me a bit worried about the condition of the patch.  Nonetheless it was not opened in any way.  With the tolerance I have from H, I decided to just put it on, not taking much at all that day, time was about 11am I believe.  As the hours passed I didnt feel much of anything & about at 8/9/10pm that same night, cant remember exactly the time but I believe I even started to slightly withdrawal (yawns, runny nose, etc) so I figured this patch was def not working.  I have a tolerance but its not crazy, I mean I never IV.  I decided to leave the patch on over night as some research I did suggested that it may take anywhere from 8-12-24 hrs to start to feel the effects the first time.  Fast-forward to the next morning approx 20-22 hours after the patch was first applied & i still didnt feel much of anything.  I also noticed that the patch was starting to peel off a little bit in a few spots, but was still attached overall.  I decided to peel the patch off, which was pretty difficult in the center of it, which was still very firmly attached.  (For the majority of wearing it, it was attached firmly)

Now my question to all of you Pro-piates out there are:

Is the patch possible bunk?  From the appearance of the outside packaging it looked very haggard, could it quite have possibly been soaked (maybe in water) and therefore lost its potency?  (When it was taken out of the original packaging it had stickers on it, that had to be peeled to apply it correctly and the adhesive seemed to be very intact)

Could the patch maybe be expired?  I looked all over the outside packaging & no where is there any information about an exp date.

What I would like to try now is to possible cut the patch into several pieces, that would be applicable for my tolerance level (Im not going to cut it in half and suck on it) I'm talking at least 8th's, possibly 16th's (depending on what I determine from my calculations) & sublingually administer the pieces to try to achieve some effect. 

Any insight would greatly be appreciated, please refrain from comments stating how powerful this substance is, I am fully aware of how strong this substance is, partly why I have not gone through with any of this yet.  ",1355116338.0

**Edit 2:** Made some formatting and spelling/grammar corrections.

**Edit 3:** Question to those who are downvoting; did you try this method and find it ineffective? I'm just wondering if there’s something that I wrote that's inaccurate or ineffective because normally you’d think that a relatively thorough guide like this posted on a subreddit dedicated to opiate discussion would be better received than Twitter-esque submissions of single doses of drugs.

Roughly two weeks ago I got two concave 40mg Opana ERs. I was led to believe that they had little to no recreational value so I wasn't expecting much from them. Anyways, I've been high off these two pills for the majority of the time I've been awake for the past two weeks and I still have half of one left. I figured I'd explain how I've been using them to you guys. My tolerance is pretty low (10-20mg of oxycodone gets me high) so this method works great for me. Keep in mind that 1mg of oxymorphone snorted is roughly equivalent to 8mg of oxycodone taken orally. This method works very well for 1mg-5mg of oxymorphone but becomes more and more of a hassle the higher your dose is. You can probably use this method even if you need the entire pill to get high but it will take a lot longer.


**Materials needed:**

1. Concave Opana ER (40mg is best since there’s a higher ratio of oxymorphone to time release gel)

2. Nail clippers (I’d use new ones or at least sterilize yours first with rubbing alcohol)

3. Large spoon (the bigger the better, it doesn’t necessarily need to be a spoon)

4. Oral syringe (more than 3ml)

5. Water
 

**Steps:**

1. Use the nail clipper to cut off however much of the pill you want to use (if you have a low tolerance use less than you’d expect you’d need and increase the dose accordingly the next time you use it, you literally need like 1/20th of a 40mg pill if you’re opioid naive).

2. Cut those pieces with the nail clipper as small as you can get them, I try to get all my pieces smaller than 1mm in all dimensions.

3. Put your pieces into the spoon.

4. Cover the pieces with 1ml-2.5ml of water.

5. Leave the pieces for 15-20 minutes, stir them every few minutes with the tip of your oral syringe or with a paper clip and scrape off the parts of the pill that get stuck to the spoon so that they stay suspended in the water. You know they're ready once all the pieces are completely clear. The water will be greyish and more vicious as well.

6. Draw up everything in your oral syringe, there will still be gel pieces stuck to the spoon so try to draw them into the syringe as well.

7. Blow your nose completely, clean it out and dry it as well as you can.

8. Drip a few drops of your solution into each nostril and tilt your head downwards so they don’t run to the back of your throat.

9. Once the drops have absorbed/dried enough that they won’t run down your throat, add some more drops and repeat this until you have all of the liquid in your nose. You’ll be able to keep all of the liquid in your nose without it dripping with a little bit of practice.

10. Once your nose dries up again and you’ve used all of your solution up, draw a couple more mls of water into the syringe and cover the tip and shake it so that it collects whatever gel is still inside the oral syringe. Use this to rehydrate your nose with more drops and allow the oxymorphone to continue to absorb.


That’s it. Clean the gel out of your nose once you stop getting high off it. If you leave it in your nose for like a day it will dry out your nose and might cause bleeding. This happened to me the first time I tried this but if you remember to clean your nose after a few hours than this method really is surprisingly gentle on your nose. I should also note that I didn’t enjoy the oxymorphone the first time I tried it but it quickly became my opiate of choice after a few more trials so make sure to give it a chance. You should aos be aware that oxymorphone withdrawals are horrid. Anyways, try it out and tell me what you guys think.",1355102662.0

Weren't they deemed ""garbage"" sort of at the time?","This is a question for some of the long term users out there, but I stopped using pharmaceuticals as my main form of opiate around the time Opana's hit the scene (must have been around 2007 or so when Oxy went beyond the trailer park and into everyone hearts and minds) and I seem to remember a lot of people really hating on Opana and saying it really wasn't worth seeking out. This was from people who usually were using 80's as their base dosing unit, so people with a tolerance going at least. However, from reading posts here, it seems like Opana was the second coming after the original formula OC's stopped being made. 

What I'm wondering if I'm remembering this wrong? I've never used Opana before, I made the move from Oxy to dope around the time the OP's started appearing (ugh glad I didn't have to mess wit that time release stuff too often). Am I crazy or does this sound familiar to anyone else? ",1355074464.0

My friend did the shot for me, and it definitely registered correctly--we got a vein.

The shot was very small, but the dope is definitely legit.  My friend has been shooting the same shit all day, and it has worked fine for her.

As I mentioned I've been snorting for years, so I definitely have got a tolerance.

As I type this, I'm thinking the red area is getting smaller.. it seems like I had some kind of reaction (histamine?).

(Story inside) anyone else have mind blowing stories of people driven by addiction?","So there is this guy who we'll call Larry. Larry is probably in his late twenties to early thirties and from out of state. He originally came to my current state for reasons unknown.. He eventually becomes friends with my h dealer and my h dealer hires him as his runner and allows him to move into his trailer. Both my h dealer and Larry probably shoot about 2.5-3 grams a day on top of smoking what I would imagine is large amounts of meth. For about a month, Larry was running sacks to my guys customers including myself, everytime arriving much later than my guy said it would take. By habit, I weigh every sack when I get home and they were always .1-.2 short and when I would ask my guy what the deal was he would deny it and say my scale was off. After the month of this, i tell my guy im done with him and he shorted me for the last time. a few days later my guy informs me that he caught Larry pinching red handed and that he no longer worked for him and he was sorry and wanted my business back.. I told him I was happy with my new guy but I would call him if my new dude was dry..

A few days went by when I got a text from Larry asking for a dub and that he was extremely sick and wanted it dropped off at his trailer because he could barely move. I was hesitant not knowing his current situation, being that there was no way he was still living with my old dealer, but being in his shoes before I figured I would help. The trailer park is on a dead end road so I gave him a call to come out and meet me when I was pulling up. He comes out and I tell him to hop in the car but he says he just wants the shit and doesn't wanna get in. Through the passenger window he leans in to hand me what is obviously a dollar bill wrapped around fucking binder paper. I tell the dude to fuck off and never call me again and he breaks down into a hysterical sobb and starts begging me for it and how he will pay me back later and all this shit. Knowing ill never get the money I tell him sorry and begin to drive away. The fucking maniac then proceeds to jump head first into my car and starts screaming at the top of his lungs. In utter disbelief I slam the brakes and tell him to get the fuck out, he then starts begging again while crying hysterically. For what felt like hours he refused to get out of my car, luckily my phone, wallet, and sack were all stored away in my door panel. I then tell him he has 3 seconds to get out of my car or I would start swinging, still he refuses to get out. I start punching him on his arm and back and he just continually sobbs and begs for the dub. It had easily been 2mins since he jumped into my car and we were in a bad part of town, all it would take is a cop to cruise by and I would have been fucked... In a last ditch effort, I pinched less than a nickel worth of the dub and threw it out the window. He finally got out of my car and began to search for the piece. I sped away in shock that someone would stoop that low for a dub, I still can't believe he pulled that shit... And the kicker of the story is that he never found that little piece and probably hit me up 10+ times after I left begging for me to come back.

So I told him I got it at woodbury commons, an outlet mall in the hudson valley of NY State.

Him: ""Oh shit my boy, I need to get to WC before christmas. You should drive me! Me and my girl wanna go!"" Me: ""Aww man, I need to make some money before I go to WC-that place sucks when you're broke.""
Him: ""Nigga, you WOULD be making money driving me there! When can we do this?"" 

So, here are the logistics. He lives an hour and 15 minutes or so from my house, with no traffic. W.C. is an hour and a half from his place. So, to drive him, I'd have to drive 5 and a half hours total.  It would cost me at least $50 bucks in gas alone to do this, and that's a lot of my time being with someone whose company I don't exactly enjoy in a place that I don't really wanna be anywhere near during the holiday season-it get's PACKED. 

Should I let him make an offer and if it's not worth it, just come up with some excuse? I mean, if he offers me 3 or more buns (buns are usually 80), I'd do it in a heartbeat, but if he's trying to get me to do all this driving for 50 bucks, no fucking way.  I have a feeling if I ask him to make an offer, he's gonna say ""What do you think is fair?"", and that's where I'm hesitant.  I don't want to highball him and piss him off, but I also don't want to offer too generous a deal, because I don't think he's the kind of guy who would say ""Aww, let me throw in some more for you.""

So, if you were in this situation, how would you handle it? Keep in mind I COULD use the money/and or free dope, especially with the holidays fast approaching.",1355389912.0

But this dope-man, is it good. And when you draw it up into the needle, even though the powder is whitish, it is a nice reassuring brownish color. (Keep in mind this is ECP).

The other dope is definitely inferior, but still gets my somewhat high, and is just SO much easier-half hour drive, text him when I'm at his door, he lets me into his front entrance, do the hand off, and I'm out. He lives in a busy, diverse neighborhood but on a fairly quiet street.  One of the least sketchy set ups bar delivery to your house.

The thing with this dope-when you're mixing it, it seems some of the particulate just REFUSES to mix, and the water drawn up through the cotton is almost completely clear.  The cotton itself is actually darker than the better dope, but that doesn't do me any good. 

So, what's the deal? Is the particulate that won't mix cut? Do I need to heat it a bit? I doubt I need to add citric acid or anything, as this is out of the Bronx. (The stamp is called ""Good Star"" if anyone has heard of it.)

********************************************************************************************

Good evening (morning?). Apologies for the long post - I'm not sure which details are relevant and which aren't.I'm not really knowledgeable on this topic and could use a lot of help, if you'd be willing. 

I've been on about 300mg (450 on bad days) for about 4 months now (legit prescription for a condition that needs surgery). I've gotten to the point where I'm taking the tramadol more to avoid side effects than because of the pain, so I felt it was time to quit. 

The withdrawal has hit me so intensely I ended up in the emergency room with really really bad anxiety, hallucinations, and delirium after about 24 hours without the medication. 

I was given 3 days worth of (low dose) Valium and 7 days of a half-dose of tramadol. The Valium wasn't strong enough and ended up on the floor in a sobbing mess again this evening . I've had to send my son to his grandparents and my husband is at his wits end. 

Does anybody know how to control the restless leg syndrome, anxiety, and insomnia until the detox is finished? How long is this expected to happen?  The ER was considering keeping me through the detox or sending me home, but decided I'd do okay at home. I'm really not okay. ",1355357097.0

It was a daily habit but I quit. Recently I downed a few vics (an amount that, during my daily habit, wouldn't have done much for me but keep the sick away, but would fuck a normal person up) and felt not near as much as I thought I would.

So as a result I've come to the conclusion that despite not having any opiates in 8-9 months that my tolerance is still there. Is this true? or am I just exaggerating how good it felt in the first place?

Either way this is my last dose of vics. I'm not the type to actively seek out stronger pharms but I would take them if offered. So I'm stopping again, simply because I can't afford the habit I used to have and this doesn't seem worth it anymore.

I posted the other day about doing my first shot and getting a weird reaction around the injection site.  It got red and hot, though it did not hurt or itch.

Since then I've done a couple of additional shots (all in my other arm) and they've all been totally fine--as you'd expect, rush, warmth, nods, etc.

Today I decided to give that arm a rest and go back to my right arm (the one that initially had the reaction).   This time i had an even weirder reaction.  My whole face and shoulders got very red and hot.  Really, my whole body from the neck up and a patch on my chest as well.  I got a pretty strong rush along with a lot of tingles/itching on my face/head.  I literally turned orange for about 10 minutes.  It freaked me out a little bit, I've never seen anything like it.

The weirdest part is I've been shooting the same exact dope in my other arm with no problems at all.  I find it hard to believe that one arm would be any different from the other, so my guess is it is just a coincidence but I'm curious if anyone has experienced anything like this before.  A friend suggested to me that it might be related to my blood pressure--I've had high blood pressure in the past though recently my doctor said my BP is fine.

Anyway, if anyone has any tips or experience to share it would be much appreciated.  As I mentioned, I'm a little freaked out by all of this and hesitant to do any more shots until I know what is going on.. but I'm sitting here with this bag of dope and pins and my desire to get high is rapidly increasing :)",1355451584.0

My Fijian friend gave me a tiny pea sized sample of ""Feem"" yesterday. He said it's opium with a little bit of down in it. It actually looks a lot like opium, but it was less hard, and more gummy/melty. Same color, sort of the same smell, maybe a little stronger. Now, I've gummed opium before, and when I gummed this, it was a hell of a lot nastier than regular opium. Much more bitter. So, I think he's right when he says there's down in it. I got the tiniest little buzz off it, due to my 60mg+ Oxy tolerance, so it was a total tease.

I plan on buying $80 worth off him today. He normally sells 3 grams of it for $180-$240 which I think is retarded, but my normal connects are dry/away at the moment. If this has down in it, wouldn't gumming it be a pretty worthless ROA, save the codeine/morphine?

This peak period of the addiction lasted about two weeks for me, then i jumped off on to subs for 3 weeks, suffered through some minor withdrawals and haven't used in 4 months.

Im going to get ten 30 mg ir's in about a week (woo!) but am wondering what my tolerance will be like once i start to use again. I hear that tolerance comes back right after the first couple of times. If i feel good with just 30mg one night, how many nights in a row can i use without jumping back to 100mg? 

More general question for everyone at r/opiates: what is your experience with tolerance breaks? Were you able to use for at least a week or two without your tolerance skyrocketing, or was it limited to about the first 3 times? Are there any of you that saw your tolerance reset more than this- where you used at least 10-15 times without having to jump back all the way up?",1355504495.0

Be honest.,"I've been tinkering with the idea of writing a ""based on a true story"" version of my life under a pen name. What I wrote about in Korea really did happen, and I wouldn't want to release it with my actual name.

I'm pretty sure all the bad guys involved forget I even exist, but I don't want to remind them. 

Anyway, I've always thought my writing was just mediocre at best, but the last two times I've written long entries on reddit-one about how to safely score weed in different South East Asian countries, and the one I just wrote about getting kid(man?)napped in Korea-I've had a bunch of people say shit like ""Oh man, you should write a book, you should write a screen play, blah blah."" (And I won't these people to know I appreciate the compliments hugely, it's just genuinely a bit of a head scratcher for me.)

I'm unemployed right now, was laid off fairly recently, and am at a point in my life where I should really focus on things that may eventually lead to me earning some fucking MONEY.   Along those lines, I feel like there is just SUCH tremendous competition in writing, with literally millions of people all over the world trying to get their work published, and very, very few ever actually make a living out of it.

Do you guys think I should go ahead with writing the book? It would be called ""All who Wander are not Lost"" and would be about how my entire life, I've ALWAYS been happiest while exploring new places-and the many adventures this disposition has led me through.

Anyway, if you're one of the people who read my story and thought, ""meh,"" please let me know that. I need a reality check, not just people telling me I'm just swell at writing. That said, people who think I'm a good writer are certainly welcome to say so-just don't be shy to speak up on the contrary.

Also, just so this isn't an issue, I wrote my Korea kidnapp story very quickly and I hadn't slept in 2 days when I wrote it, so I am aware there are tons of little typos in it (using their instead of there, then instead of than), and I would fix shit like that before publishing.  I'm looking more for critique such as ""your writing flow isn't working"" or ""this just isn't that interesting.""

I know this doesn't really have to do with drugs, but the two posts I've made that have garnered such positive attention have both largely been about drugs.  If I post this on A.R. or something, they're gonna go through my post history, see that I'm a junkie, and just discount everything I say anyway.  Mods, I hope you let this post survive.

Thanks

Unfortunately, my connect has become really inconsistent and H has been hard to come by. Luckily he does have blues but going from BTH to roxies just isn't cutting it. 

I'm desperate enough to consider IVing roxies. I want to do it right though and want the right gear. Unfortunately it seems like there are no needle exchanges in my county and even a pharmacy won't have everything I'm looking for. 

Here are my questions:
1. what gauge / volume needle do I need? Are there any other specific features I should seek? (for example, do I need to specify I want a shorter needle?)
2. where can I buy a wheel filter? (I've seen those pictures of the before and after filter under a microscope and I definitely want a proper filter) 
3. where do I start in terms of dosage? Is 7.5 mg of roxy a safe starting point for a first time IV user (but I am a tolerant opiate user, I could probably do 60 - 90 mg of roxy at a time orally / insufflate and be okay) 
4. once I start IVing, will plugging pale in comparison? I always hear that plugging is the next best thing so I'm wondering if I'll be able to go back to that once I can source more chiva.

I just need a ear.,"Hey guys and girls. I have only made a comments and one post on here, but that doesn't mean my shy and recluse ass is afraid to post on here. It's just who I am. That being said I'm comfortable coming here to be heard. 

I did just fuck up. I'm waiting for the fever to strike.  Backstory; Normally I take my wash and, after placing in a clean rig  -fliter by placing used cotton and wash in another clean pin and pushing into spoon- then use that as the water in my second shot which is usually not to far away. At the longest I may have waited 3-4 hours. This is not so bad and never did me wrong. Well it's always done me right.

Here is where I get stupid. I went through the ritual of the above but wound up saying, fuck it, and didn't use it right away bc I had so much product (roxi 30's -just moved to midwest and that's all I can find). Well I went dry and normally I suck it up and drive on but as I was going through w/d (here's the addicts excuse), I recived news that my mother was in the hospital back home and they don't know what is wrong with her. This is the same woman that wrote me everday for 3 years as I was in combat daily (Army). So with that, the withdraw, Oh and I also took two 25 mg XR Adderall - which is making me feel like I'm on coke or some shit, with a constant clenched jaw and that mess. I hate that feel because I already deal with PTSD and the rapid heartbeat and speeding thoughts is what I try to avoid. I think that's why I love opiates so much. Everything just melts away and I feel at ease for once in my own skin. It's either that or become the raging alcoholic that I am and can so easly be. But alcohol only works so long before it's 5 a.m. and I'm drunk, in my uniform, and sleeping outside -that's when things go good after drinking haha-. 

I really don't know why I'm writting this. I am just in a bad place mentally. Extremely depressed.  Oh on one of the old pre-loaded rings I found inside it a discoloration, which was clearly a build up of bacteria. I didn't use that one of course. I didn't notice any in the ones I was inspecting before hand. Although I was just inspecting them in general and not exactly looking for something like that. I'm sure it would have stood out if it was in the ones a used.

Ok I guess I'm done going off. I know there are a lot of people on here who care -part of my willingness to air my feelings. I also know I'll be calles a fuckin dumbass from others. Either way it feels good to get some of the things that weigh my mind down out of my mind. I can't exactly say anything like this to anyone I know. So thank you all for being here, if you read it or not.

Also, I'm not so good with writting. So I'm sorry for grammar and pronunciation. After all I've been a combat soldier my whole life. They really don't focus on that accept when training us. Haha.

Edit: This is not a pity party post. I'm not that kind of guy. I just know what I did is going to result in some kind of pain. The over riding thoughts of realise over came my common sence. Even though I knew better. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for your concern and reply's. Even though my writting is horrible and hard to dechiper.

I could probably get something stronger, but I'm not trying to get high and the tramadol does a pretty good job, it lasts long (sometimes I can feel it 24hrs later!), and it's not as tempting to abuse as other opiates/opiods. The snri activity worries me a little, and due to abusing it a bit early on I'm now running low so I was looking into the M1 metabolite.  How does it compare? I assume the addiction potential is back up there with hydros and oxy's, not too worried still as I have good impulse control, but what about the half life? Otherwise I assume it feels just like tramadol for the most part no, or at least its pain relieving properties. Does anyone know how they compare mg to mg? If not perhaps how much of tramadol is typically converted to  O-desmethyltramadol in those of us who have no trouble metabolizing it? I assume that would give a rough idea. I'll start small either way to be safe, but I need an idea of how much to get. I don't want to get more than I need. Depending how I like it I may end up alternating between the two to keep the snri activity down if it's cost effective.

So this is kind of an odd post.  It's mostly just a reality check to make sure that what I'm experiencing isn't placebo.

BACKSTORY WEEE!: I have been legitimately prescribed a myriad of opiates for little over a year now.  I initially had colorectal cancer, which (luckily) is in remission, and then that gave way to a bunch more fun stuff like ulcerative colitis.

Anyway, I've had to switch and rotate through a bunch of different opiates for different reasons.  Either bad side-effects or insurance coverage/cost were the reasons for the switch and I was determined to find something that worked for me with minimal side-effects. That combo is currently 15mg Oxycodone (a214s) 6 times a day for breakthrough (which I get quite a bit of each and everyday) and Exalgo (Hydromorphone Extended Release form) 12mg 2 times a day. I have abused these a couple of times, just in an attempt to get more relief on the really bad days.  I've mainly just plugged the Exalgo on a couple of occasions because a. I don't like needles, and b. the Exalgo kind of gels up even when cut-up correctly anyway.

Anyway, due to some stupidity on my case I had a small bag from school stolen which contained my pills for a couple of days, and a couple of notebooks.  So I'm going to run short on my Rx and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize my standing with my doctor, so I have been toughing out the 4 days I've been short.

SO HERE IS THE MAIN DILEMMA: So I've been trying to find anything that will easily help me get through these couple of days.  So that lead me to a zip-locked baggie of used up Watson gel-reservoir-type Fentanyl 75mcg patches that I had been on ages ago (I switched from these because costs ended up being astronomical even for the generic Watson versions).  I don't know why I saved these old used up patches but I just did.

So to try to get some relief from the withdrawals I took the leftover patches (about 4 of them) opened them up, put them in a small glass and covered it with warm water from the tap. Swirled this around for about 20min. sucked it up with a syringe and plugged it.

Right now I feel pretty damn good.  Now I am wondering if this is just placebo? Or would there actually be enough fentanyl in those patches for me to get any effect at all?  Also, even if there was fentanyl on them, was that the best way to utilize it?  I'd never had any effect from chewing on them before. I plugged some of the gel once, and gee-golly that was intense.

Sorry for the long post, but I figured I should include some background on my usage.  Thank in advance for your opinions.",1355839312.0

The problem I have with this stuff is it's too damn strong. An 8 -10mg line has me fucking gone so I have decided to shoot 1 - 2mg as a tester. As good as my scales are I don't believe they will be accurate at such a low weight so I would like to measure out my shot using the volumetric method instead. The problem is that I will mix up much more solution than I need so can I just bottle up the excess in a sterile jar for another day or am I just going to have to man up and spread my cheeks?

Well, since I've swallowed, snorted, shot, and shoved up my ass damn near every opiate you can get, I thought maybe I'd try to make a kind of comprehensive list of the subjective effects of different opiates. *(Plus I'm high, bored, and I can't sleep for shit.)* Since everyone's experience is different, please take this little guide with a grain of salt. Still, even though I'm calling myself connoisseur of opiates, I hope everyone else will chime in and add their opinions too.

Anyway... I hope someone can get some use or entertainment from this list. If not, well at least writing it kept me entertained for a bit.

Codeine - This is a step up from Tramadol but that's really not saying too much. Its available over the counter in a lot of countries, and that fact should tell you all you need to know about this. Its best used to stave off withdrawal when nothing else is available. There are two exceptions to that statement. The first is if you have either no tolerance or an absolutely microscopic habit, and the second is if you have some Sprite, a double-stacked styrofoam cup, and a Jolly Rancher. (Heh... Jolly Rancher story.) If you have the second, use those ingredients with some codeine/promethazine cough syrup to make yourself some ""Lean,"" or ""Purple Drank."" The promethazine potentates the slight action of the codeine and counteracts the shitty side effects of some pretty severe itchiness and nausea. Final verdict... Use it to stay well or get some cough syrup to get your lean on, but be prepared to be underwhelmed. 
**Codeine is VERY slightly euphoric, but is also very sedating, stomach churning while being itchy as a two dollar whore's week old panties.**

Hydrocodone - Now we're starting to talk about real opiates. Unless specially compounded (or in cough syrup form, but after codeine I'm done talking about syrup) hydrocodone always comes with the dreaded acetaminophen. So unless you hate your life you're going to need to do a cold water extraction. Once you do that you've got a pretty good starter opiate which will introduce you to the power of the poppy. Hydrocodone produces decent euphoria without too much sedation. Itchiness and nausea will increase with the dose. The main difference between hydrocodone and other opiates in that hydrocodone gives a euphoric burst of energy that is similar to a low-grade coke buzz. You'll be talkative and in the mood to get shit done. This and oxycodone used to be my ""clean the apartment, cook dinner, and bang the girlfriend"" pills. 
**If you use a CWE your liver will thank you. I think of hydrocodone as the poor man's oxycodone. One of the biggest pluses, however, is the fact that its a Schedule III where all other worthwhile opiates are Schedule II. Because of that its much easier to either find these on the streets, in your friend's and family's medicine cabinets (dentists especially seem to love writing for these), or to get them scripted to you for some bullshit reason like a stubbed toe or broken penis.**

Oxycodone - Speaking of oxycodone... Here is where we start to get pills without extra shit like promethazine and acetaminophen. (Except for Percocet, Endocet, and Donkeyballsocet.) The effects of oxycodone are almost exactly like hydrocodone except that oxy is stronger and, in my experience, tends to produce much more energy. If hydro has the buzz from mediocre coke, oxy has the buzz from high quality yayo. Its also a bit more itchy, and from what everyone has told me, is also a lot more nauseating. Of special note is that Roxicodone can be smoked for a unique high, similar (but much, much weaker) to smoked fentanyl. Furthermore, moving up in strength, this is the first opiate that can be IV-ed, although with a ridiculously high oral bio-availability and the lack of a rush from shooting there is really no reason to put oxycodone in a rig. 
**Now we're starting to talk about the good stuff. Its called ""hillbilly heroin"" for a reason boys and girls - mainly because when snorted it feels like a non-sedating heroin. Very euphoric and energetic by just eating the pills. Unique in that it can also be smoked - like fentanyl - but personally knowing how good it is snorted and swallowed, I never saw the point.**

Morphine - Here we go, the gold standard of opiates. First off, unless its going in a vein, its being wasted since every other route of administration's bioavailability is absolute shit. (Okay, yeah, except for plugging it, but I always lump plugging and shooting together since they produce similar results.) In a perfect situation you can only get 60 mg in 1 ml of water, so it takes some practice to learn how to perfect the extraction of the goodies from the pills. When shot, morphine produces a huge histamine release (the pins and needles) which some people enjoy while others hate. A big dose will also leave you flushed and possibly with the worst headache you've ever had. Its very sedating, so you can forget all about that feeling of energy I was talking about that comes with hydro- and oxycodone. This is a chill out, one eye open, maybe nodding out kind of opiate. It might not be a whole different world from what I talked about above, but its at least a different continent. 
**Sweet Mother Morphine... Sedating, defines euphoric, has great legs, but has to be IV-ed. Even then you're maxed out with 60 mg per 1 ml of water, so preparing pills for IV is an art. Also, some people HATE the unique rush. But some people are fucking idiots, so there you go...**

Hydromorphone - Like hydrocodone and oxycodone above, hydromorphone and oxymorphone are very similar. That being said, don't mix up -MORPHONE and -CODONE, because that's like mixing up dynamite and a nuclear bomb. With hydromorphone (Dilaudid, or dillies) its IV or nothing. Really. I swear. If you're not IV-ing your hydromorphone I beg of you to sell it to a junkie who will. Its too good to waste and anything other than IV is a complete waste. Hydromorphone has arguably the best rush - it combines the best parts of the morphine rush and the oxycodone high, compressed into about a roller coaster ride of around a minute. The biggest downside is that hydromorphone has no legs. Aside from smoking oxycodone or fentanyl, shooting hydromorphone is the crack of opiates. You will look up from the rush and ask, ""Awesome! Can we go again?"" And no, you can't, because one, its expensive and two, your receptors are bound. 
**IV is required and 100% worth it, but there are no legs whatsoever. No legs, so this bastard rolls around in one of those hoover-round electric wheelchairs. Since the duration is so short there's no real negative side effects. Well, except for immediately wanting more...**

Oxymorphone - Opana is my favorite opiate and honestly blends all the best aspects of oxycodone, morphone, and hydromorphone. While I only IV it, I know that some people have had good results with insulfation. Its incredibly euphoric, second only to really good heroin, it produces a rush that is right up there with hydromorphone, and has the energetic buzz of a large dose of oxycodone. Furthermore, a lot like my experience with morphine, it seems like I can flip it mentally and go from energized to nodding out by relaxing and closing my eyes. If there is a downside, its the fact that the legs are a bit short and because of the euphoria you find yourself wanting more right after you've shot. Regardless, oxymorphone, I love you. 
**Bad mouth oxymorphone and I'll stab you in the throat and then fuck the wound. It has the best parts of oxycodone, morphine, and hydromorphone, but will leave you wanting more almost immediately. Aside from that, watch out for a bit of extra nausea.**

Fentanyl - What can I say about fentanyl... Well, first off, the bad. Its know to produce a lot of nausea. Its so insanely powerful that its measured in micrograms. Lastly, there's no real good, easy way to abuse it. Yes, the patches can be cut up and gummed, worn on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet with a heating pad on it, or (as I've been told once or twice before) use alcohol to prep them for IVl. The best way, however, is to smoke the gel squeezed out of the patches. (I'm not sure which brand has the gel... Does anyone know? I'm too lazy to Google it...) Still, for me, the only reason I would use the patches is to stay well while I'm on the hunt for an opiate I'd enjoy. On the plus side, however, fentanyl is quite euphoric, but its also very sedating. 
**Its difficult to abuse, very euphoric but very sedating. When smoked, there are no legs whatsoever. However, if used as directed - or even carefully gummed or worn to maximize absorption - it can be fantastic for staying well until something better comes around.**

Methadone - Methadone is a perfect example of a double edged sword. It can be the best thing for maintenance, but if you ever want to come off the drug you had better prepare yourself for a month of hell. First, the good... It can be very euphoric, it can last a long time, and it really doesn't take much to get where you want to be. The bad aspects, however, are the kind of things which keep me away from methadone. As I already said, it has a long half-life, which means it will last a good while, but that means withdrawal lasts a good while too, plus it takes hours for your dose to take effect. Knowing myself, I'd be likely to re-dose early and end up falling out. Finally, the oral bio-availability is much like oxycodone, so there is no need to IV. Plus, even if you did IV, there is no rush and it still took hours before I felt any effect. 
**Euphoric, but sedating. Long half-life means a long withdrawal and a long time before you feel your dose. Lastly, there's no point in IV, which will do nothing to solve my needle fetish.**

Okay, I'll go back later today and edit this to clean it up because right now I'm fucking exhausted. I hope someone out there enjoys the post and maybe has a few questions answered. Like I said, if nothing else it gave me something to do.

The OP *(protip: OP is always a faggot)* in the other sub basically said that he had never seen a junkie with a cold, and then there were a few snarky comments about how would an addict even be able to tell because they'd either be too high to notice or too in withdrawal to distinguish between ""I need chick noodle soup sick"" and ""I need some goddamn opiates sick.""

In my career as an opiate addict both of those are valid points, but in thinking about it and asking a few fellow junkies, I can honestly say that I'm starting to wonder if opiates give us some kind of extra boost to our immune system or, at the very least, a mildly useful superpower. I know that since I've started using everyday I haven't caught a cold or suffered from any allergies, which really has me curious, because in college I was sick more than most other students and I used to have allergic reactions to damn near everything in nature.

My ex-girlfriend says that she hasn't gotten sick since she started shooting about four years ago, and one old-timer I know who has twenty-five plus years under his belt claims that aside from his hepatitis C he's never sick and hasn't been to the doctor for a non-liver related issue in at least twenty years.

So, some questions...

First, how often do you guys and gals catch colds or deal with illnesses? Or how about other addicts you know? Are any of them imbued with the same shitty superpower?

Second, does anyone know of any academic or professional studies about this, or am I completely talking out of my ass? I'm really curious, and I wonder if anyone with an MD or PhD after their name has had the same curiosity.

Before you condemn me- I will get around to cross posting on r/opiates recovery. I am currently almost finished with my first full day of sobriety. Man does it fucking suck. But I want to compile a list of things that have made it easier an even bearable at times for me. I'm not a doctor but lord knows I could be a great pharmacist.

Things that have helped me:

Benzos- your gonna be anxious when you start your detox. If your like me, then there's not a lot worse than sitting around feeling anxious. Fix it. I was fortunate to get a doc to prescribe me klonopin, which I favor because it lasts a long time. Ativan also works well. I know NA people will disagree with using other drugs to get off another but then again a lot of people don't agree with NA. This is was is working currently for me

Weed- I know another drug, but come on at least your getting off heroin (physically)with its help. It will distract your mind from the mountains of body aches you'll be feeling

Ibiprofin- for aches. Didn't help me out that much. 

Cigarettes- if u smoke, one addiction at a time. Although it would ideally be good to stop both addictions, if your like me say fuck it one at a time. Plus the nicotine gives u temporary relief from body aches and anxiety. Plus u usually poo afterwards.

Hot shower- something about it made me feel the best I have all day. The warm water is reminiscent of the warm rush that comes over you on opiates without the cost. After me shower igot on my bed FEELING LIKEa I CAN ACTUALLY SLEEP.

NyQuil- sleepy stuff


I know you guys are having fun being junkies, I was there and might be again if I fuck up. But remember THE LONGER YOU WAIT TO QUIT THE WORSE THE WITHDRAWLS WILL BE.  Also Iv use can damage your heart valves- shit. Have fun, but don't let yourself become a slave.",1356234167.0

However, the doctor cut me off eventually as he started to question me. Anyways, fast forward to heroin.

I've been wanting to try heroin for the past few years now. I was aware that it was addictive but had no idea that after my first session, I was completely hooked that for the past 2 weeks, I have been smoking heroin almost every day until after binging last weekend, I had what seemed like withdrawl symptoms, much much more uncomfortable than with oxycodone withdrawl. 

I actually thought I had caught a cold but on friday, when I finally scored some H, I was so happy I rushed home and funny thing happened as soon as I started taking hits. The cold symptoms went away, suddenly I don't feel depressed (mdma depression is still worse) I am not cold and my entire body is not aching, My eyes welled up in tears out of sheer relief.

I wasted about close to 500 on just heroin. I cut out other drugs I was doing like coke so I could afford more of heroin.

when I close my eyes to sleep, somehow, the mental image of lighting up the tinfoil and chasing the smoke rises, and it scares the shit out of me....

anyways, I been trying to stop but have failed. The only reason I was dry for 4 days was because my guy was unavailable. Otherwise, I would have not taken that 4 day rest period. It felt like it lowered my tolerance taking that break. 

I like to smoke heroin first and mj after. I feel like mj is still something I can do on a daily basis but heroin is starting to feel like a different animal. like already I have failed to stop, and honestly I see why. 

Although, it hasn't been all that bad so far. Heroin has made me less depressed. Honestly, I feel like it has allowed me to become more empathetic to others, and I could feel love in it's fully glory. I realized that everything I love is very fragile and a part of me screams at me to stop, it's not worth it but I know I love this feeling too much to suddenly stop.

All in all, I feel both blessed to be able to meet the heroin personality, I think it's definitely a she like marijuana. coke was definitely male, not sure about X, I would say X is a tranny (lol). Speaking of tranny, I realized I might be transgendered, fml. 

I told two people about my heroin use. One friend thinks I stopped. Another friend knows well about my drug use.

On a few occassions I smoked heroin at work in the washroom during lunch breaks. I also did coke a few times during the crunch period. I also smoked weed but the paranoia got the better of me and I decided to simply walk to my place and get high and come back to work...

I can clearly see where this is headed. I desperately want to stop but afraid of the withdrawl symptoms. Today, I almost felt like I didn't need to smoke heroin ( I found playing pc games like battlefield series) kept my mind off. I also went to YMCA and got a membership card so I could start swimming and jogging and also quit cigarettes in the process....

I really would like some advice...I feel like I can go cold turkey but after binging, the withdrawl would be just insane. it seems to get worse and more intense every time, my tolerance is going up and up so I have to smoke more and more.

Last weekend, I thought about shooting up because my thinking was, ""smoking gets only partially high, I can get way more high at reduced dosage)....., but I don't know where to acquire needles and honestly feel like it's a lot of fucking hassle just to get high. Although it's very seductive, I think if I start shooting up I will be on a faster train to hell. Also, I don't know what shit is being cut into the stuff I'm buying so I think I will leave my veins alone. I'm just paranoid and hate needles in general.

yeah so smoking I'm fine with although I'm a bit creeped out about all the aluminum foils being used...I mean what if I end up inhaling all that tiny foil dust.

but the more fucked up thing is how fucking indifferent I am to what's happening. Yes, I am blowing my money to stay high all the time, my career is at risk (people started noticing I am gone for long periods and noticed crappy quality in my work), but how fuckign cliche is this shit? Despite fuck all, a part of me is keeping me going.

Now my biggest fear is relapse. I've tasted heroin's forbidden fruits what will it take me to go an a binge again? 

If you read this far, thank you very much for hearing me out. I do not think I am in seirous emergency situation but feel like I am playing a very different game compared to all other substances I've tried so far.

tldr: smoked heroin for the first time two weeks ago, been hooked since, have not been able to stop but trying to find subsitutes or other solutions to help with withdrawl when I go cold turkey for new years resolution (my plan is to not touch any drug except alcohol)....

cheers....

I was expecting little to no high from all this.
About an hour after dosing, however, I was seriously sedated, and feeling more euphoric than the last time I took hydro (40mg total). Nausea followed shortly after. Pretty soon I had to excuse myself. As walked toward the bathroom the puke warning was going off in my throat. I didn't know if I was going to make it to the bathroom. 
I ended vomiting into a garbage can and diarrhea-ing into the toilet at the same time.

This is more about law, something I'm less versed in.

Let's say I wanted to get some opiates via Silk Road.  I don't need much, as I tend to dose pretty low and I never binge.  For me it's all about relaxing and being pain-free for a few hours.  Two percocet (or equivalent) is basically my maximum.  With that in mind, what should I look for to *maximize* safety (as in, as close to zero chance of anything happening to me law-wise as possible)?  Drug, dose, frequency of purchase, etc.  It doesn't have to specifically be hydrocodone or oxycodone or anything, as long as it's got the same basic effect.

I know some drugs are easier to sniff out than others, and amounts higher than x of y will get you in special kinds of trouble, etc.  So what I'm really asking is how much opiate I can get without having to worry.

I live in the US.  I don't want to be more specific than that, but if state *does* matter, please simply direct me to resources on that topic so I can keep this post as anonymous as possible.

And getting a dealer isn't happening.  We'll leave it at that.

I have a pretty much an unlimited supply of 80mg OCs due to my fathers pain problem. He has bottles all over the place in his cabinet and last year I took a bottle with about 100 pills in them.

I've experimented with drugs in the past, but I've never found myself addicted to any one substance. However since I have such a readily available supply that is free I find myself doing these more than any other drug I have taken. I usually split these up into quarters and only take about 20mg when I go out to party on the weekend. In fact I have no desire to take them during the week or without alcohol. It actually makes me sick if im not drinking with it. I enjoy it while drinking because I don't have to drink as much and it actually helps my game since they make me more confident and talkative. I've had some very fun times this year.

I have a great job and a great life and never really thought I had a problem because I've been able to control my use. However I have been watching a lot of shows like Drugs Inc. and they have kind of freaked me out on saying how a lot of heroin addicts started on oxy. I definitely don't want to go down that path.

So I'm a little conflicted. I don't have a desire to up my use but it is becoming a normal thing to do every other weekend or so just like going to the bar and getting a drink. Thoughts and advice much appreciated!",1356940436.0

i feel like living in southern california, some decent BTH shouldn't be this hard to find but i'm finding it impossible to get any. anything decent at least. i have come across some really shitty stuff, the kind that doesn't shatter or get sticky when exposed to the air, the kind where you can see all he murky particles floating around when dissolved in the water (the kind that's cut to shit basically). 

i've found some 200 mg morphine sulfate and i'm wondering if that's worth my time at all if i plug it? would the effects be any better than 40 mg of ER oxycodone taken orally? how about 15 mg of roxi insufflated? 

sigh i wish it wasn't so hard to find tar, i am DYING for some right now but because this connect has been so reliable for the past 8 months i haven't looked around for any new ones. 

anyway, if anyone has any experience with these different opiates and could give me a recommendation on that 200 mg morphine, that would be awesome. i know morphine is weak taken orally but mg to mg isn't it stronger than oxy? and with a higher BA plugging it i'm hoping i can catch a decent nod from it, maybe even from half or a quarter of the pill at a time.

and if anyone in the orange county/socal area would like to have a meetup i'd be down for that. i'm free tonight and tomorrow during the day and i have nothing planned so a meetup might be fun eh? 

anyway, sorry for my rant, but if anyone has any knowledge to impart on me, i'd be forever grateful!

I've never iv'd h but I've smoked and snorted it. Most of my opiate usage has been hydrocodone and smoking opium, but I haven't had pills since last February and I haven't had opium since 2010. 


My drug of choice over the last few years has been alcohol, and the only time's I've been off that was when I had pills given/sold to me. I'm trying to sober up again for a little while and am having trouble finding pills. Every time I've had pills it's either been from someone who took them from someone's prescription to sell, or from another type of dealer (weed, etc) who happened to have them for whatever reason.

I'm open to trying h again but I'm hesitant about injecting. I really don't care the delivery method I guess. I guess my main question is how do you guys find a new connect? Since I haven't bought any drugs in a few years I'm sort of lost.

One other question, at a music festival in 2008 I traded some shrooms for a gram of what this guy called ""white rock opium"". I'd never heard of it before and was intrigued (albeit young and stupid), and went on with it. We crushed it into a powder and smoked it with weed. Anyone heard of this before?

  I'm thinking about sitting my brother down for a talk about the dangers of using prescription pills/opiates, which will include how easily addictive they are, how much trouble he'll get in if he gets caught, showing him statistics on overdoses, and informing him how to use in the safest manner. If I can't stop him from experimenting I can at least prevent harm right? 

  If the situation escalates I will have no choice but to tell our parents and his friends parents but right now I think it's just a faze where teenagers are starting to experiment with other substances besides cannabis.
