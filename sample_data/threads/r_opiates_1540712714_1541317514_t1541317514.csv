Back in 2012 I was ordering about two packages a week from the main market. All domestic shippers because fuck waiting for International shipping. I never worried about customs just didn't want to wait.

The address I was using was a friend's place under a name of a roommate who recently moved out. My buddy who was letting me crash was not cool with shit coming to his house. The name and address I was using worked just fine.

Until it didn't. I ordered from a top 3 vendor based out of BC Canada. It was a half gram of powdered H as all I could get was tar. I'm at the address for a week waiting for mail to come. One day I was copping some 30s and couldn't be at the address during mail time. So I call my buddy up and ask him if anything came.

He said fuck yeah something came. Half the God dn police force and other badges came knocking on the door asking who was the person listed on the package, where was he, who ordered it, etc.

Now I immediately called bullshit and figured he was keeping my dope for himself. So we meet at a coffee shop and his phone keeps rinifn he hands it to me to answer saying it's the detective on the case. I refuse so he answers. ""hey, so and so, how are ya, it's detective Shrimpdick here, glad you finally answered look we don't want you we want the person who ordered it, who was it where is he, etc""

Now it happens we are in a small town and I knew exactly who Detective Shrimpdick was and knew his voice so it wasn't some act he was pulling on me. I said fuck dude don't answer don't tell him shit they can't charge anyone. He said look if they cuff me and charge me I gotta tell them who it was but until then I won't say nothing.

Detective Shrimpdick called for a couple weeks then dropped it.

FAST FORWARD A FEW YEARS...

I'm in a new town and meet a buddy who is from UK. He was getting OC 80s shipped from a buddy of his back home where they never discontinued them. You can look at my post history and see where I posted a few pics of these beautiful creations. So over a couple weeks he gets 3 or 4 packages sent in no problem. Then one day when we are expecting a package he sees a note left on door attempting delivery and to go to Post Office for pick up. This happened half the time no big deal. We'll he goes in there grabs package comes out and 5 cops surroi d him and book him on 3 different felonies. He had 40 of those fuckers on him and his case will probably go federal.

Obviously I'm sketched out to use the Markets after this. How do you set up decoy addresses? I want to order bad  but how can I after these experiences? ",1541306182.0

The only actual instructions on the bottle (other than the warnings and whatnot) was to take 10mL before bed, with the words ""pharmacy advice"" written beneath it in red. I already looked around the web to try and see if there was any dosage information and found nothing of use. I'm wondering if anyone here either by total luck has a monograph or knows the amount of codeine per 10mL? I want to enjoy it but I also don't want to end up using too much.

It was hard struggling with a Dilaudid and Vicodin and various other opiates over the years.

Getting Diazepam (Valium) seemed to hard to get from my doc. I turned onto Diclazepam in the RC scene.

Along with 1/4 g weed, 2400mg Gabapentin, 3.5mg Diclazepam, a pinch of weed, and 20mg Baclofen, the opiate wd's are under control as of now.

I never thought I would start a regimen like this, but it def gets the job done.

It was my second time ever using, and because I won’t be touching any opioids (or opiates) for the next couple months, I decided to go for the “full experience”. I didn’t experience any throat swelling or any type of actual allergic reaction, my face isn’t swollen, just red around my eyes. I also take 18 mg concerta every day, and researched to see if it was safe for me to take opioids whilst on a stimulant like that, and apparently, they used to be commonly combined because the stimulant increases the pain reducing effect of the opioid. So I’m not dying or anything- I did throw up once, and now, after 6 hours post-dosing, I still get waves of nausea, often feeling like I’ll actually throw up, about once every half an hour. Oh yeah, I also smoked some weed before I dosed the opioids, and my time perception is _still_ a bit off. What can I do about my appearance?

I’m a newbie (and don’t intend to get “into it”), and this was my second time taking opioids. I took probably too many, while on 18 mg concerta, and smoked pot on top of that.

I was big on Kratom for a while and the whole community was against subs and made it seem like the devil.  

Kratom started giving me bad anxiety,  nightmares,  and panic attacks and even long tolerance breaks just stopped working as well.  It was also addicting and getting me high. The short duration didn't help and didn't curb my cravings for H and only masked withdrawals. I also had 2 seizures 15 minutes after taking it on separate occasions which. I never had a seizure and those are the only ones I've had since. 

I understand Kratom seems to work for a lot so im still in favor of it and protest for it and support it's use and legality.  But I'm also able to be unbiased and understand it's not perfect.  I've seen how People get be very addicted to it. I don't talk much about the negative sides because it's not welcomed by anyone. 

I was wd'n bad from dope after Kratom stopped working and went back to. 5 g a day. I was tired of feeling like death and being broke all the time so I gave in and my roommate gave me 8mg strip.  I put it under my tongue not expecting much but about an hour later I wasn't wd'n at all.  I felt baseline.  It didn't feel like it was masking it, just removing it.  I also wasn't high. (which people tell me I'm lying) it sucks. I know for a fact I wasn't high or trying to,  and being accused of lying sucks when you're a junkie.  If I was high I'd let anyone know.  I also wasn't craving any drug at all. I was content. The change my mind and body went through within an hour was amazing.  I didn't Know of I could feel baseline without wanting to get high. No one I know really used subs for their intended use and it's got a bad wrap for just being another opioid that gets you high. 

I made an appointment and will be getting 14 a week (way too much). I bought another strip from my roomie and did half this time and it seemed to work better.  I was able to sleep unlike the while strip. I also haven't done it 2 days in a row because the next day I still feel normal.  I felt the wd coming back and did 4mg.

I'm worried I'll be on this for a while but compared to the alternative,  it's a godsend and my life and positive outlook has increased tenfold. 

I'm going to continue to use it until I get my life back together and back in a routine where I'm productive.  

I wish I had tried it earlier and not fed into the horror stories and anti pharmacy retort. Everyone has different things that work. 

Sorry if it sounds like some hail corporate shit, but I never saw the light at the end of the tunnel and getting to over a gram a day and ending up homeless and poor destroys you and your outlook. 

I wish I read more positive stories from people using alternatives whether it's Kratom or a pharm. Looking back on how dope destroyed my personality  makes me sick.

I haven't gone to my college classes because I can't stop fucking coughing and it's embarrassing.

But the point is, my doctor prescribed me 180 ml of codeine cough syrup last Thursday. I went to go fill it at a Walmart pharmacy and the pharmacist gave me so much fucking heat about it. He said he could only give me 7 days worth, and every pharmacy on the face of the planet would only fill 7 days worth. He said it would take 20 minutes to fill so I went out to my car to call around pharmacies a bit. I found one that would and went in to get my perscription sheet back like 5 minutes into the 20 minutes he said. Then it's somehow magically filled and he instead hands me the medication (only 50 ml) and says ""talk to your doctor for the rest.""

So I got her to fill the rest on Thursday, at a different pharmacy. But they're out of stock until Tuesday. And they REALLY didn't want to even order it because these new ""opiod crisis"" rules make it not even worth their time, essentially, which I get now.

TLDR: So basically it's taking me 12 days to get CODEINE because of the scary ass opiod crisis. Codeine kills em all mang. And this cough SUCKS. ",1541251858.0

Recently my provider left the health care center I go to and I started seeing the person she recommened. Per usual with new doctors it was suggested I attend some sort of cognitive behavioral therapy as a coping mechanism for pain, but she continued my prescription due to my x-rays showing how messed up my shoulder and middle back is.

Anyway I noticed when I received my prescription that it says it has one refill. This is a prescription for 120 count 10/325 norcos which is schedule II and treated the same as other more powerful pain medications. 

Does this seem like an honest mistake on the pharmacy's part? I'll add the pharmacy is attached to the health care center. I know at some point this year electronic transmission of pain medication subscriptions was being allowed as opposed to the paper prescriptions. Am I missing something or are doctors allowed to write refills on schedule II pain medication now? I know in the past I've received up to 6 month scripts for tramadol (after it became schedule IV) as well as klonopin.

I thought this would benefit me and my wife.

Okay now this is a new cycle getting under my skin so bad and I am considerate for everyone’s feelings, I talk things out and understand I don’t jump to controlling the situation.

But EVERY night my wife gets off work at her pizza job (and a few hours before getting off) she gets into texting me things like “I’m numb”, “I just been thinking”, and then she always references how a guy work buddy or friend asked her “are you really happy with him? You look miserable, I can see he’s a great guy and all but I see you being miserable in life.”  

Then I find myself pushing myself extremely hard to keep being on track (been on Suboxone and Valium steady for 6 months without relapse), but the depression part of getting up I’ve been pushing through that and doing well.

And when I come to tears hearing her say shes wanting to “separate”, I continue to respect her and ask what I’ve been doing wrong and access the situation so I can improve things during her space. But then we’re in the same bed, acting awkward. Wake up, morning comes, and it’s “hey, I know I’m feeling this way thank you for respecting, etc.” all the sadness is inside me, then she comes and sits on my lap, then we kiss like this didn’t happen; and she tells me “I love you I just want you to do more and talk less and stay away from toxic people” in which I’ve been doing, but I do more and more and more as I hear this continuously.

This is to the point where I feel like losing my shit, going into her work (which is unlike me) and telling off every man who’s playfully flirted, influenced her mind, planting these kinds of seeds in her mind and it takes over me hearing this again now tonight and I feel like just crying my eyes out and being violent towards these people (not my wife) or something because all I do is change, do more good (especially per her request) & now because of this continuous buildup, it’s making me feel completely insane!

How the fuck do I stop this cycle of influence?! I usually fall back and respect everyone’s beliefs and decisions but this is seemingly a crazy cycle occurring especially being with the woman you love of 5 years. She’s gullible and I feel like she’s being taken advantage in this sense somehow. 

I really need help on this my friends of opiates. My bropiates... -pickle isn’t feeling all okay about this happening now, over and over!!!!!  

PS I lost drive to continue working for extra money once I heard a piece of her mind with this stuff again, which has only been happening since she’s started working there and sometimes how “they get flirty, but they’re not trying to get in my pants”. That kills me even more and I feel fucking worthless now. Seriously now.... :(",1541216012.0

How long did the withdrawal that is sent you into last? I have heard of people needing multiple doses because it will only last a short time and the person will start nodding out again once it wears off or once the dope/opiate overpowers it . Also were you physically addicted or dependent when you were given the Narcan? If you were not addicted/dependent when you were dosed with Narcan did It still send you into withdrawal? If it did send you into withdrawal how long did the withdrawal last? How long was it before you used again after being dosed with Narcan? When you did finally end up using again after being Narcan'd, did you notice any difference than the way you normally felt? was your normal dose any stronger or weaker than normal after you were given Narcan?


What was a general summary of your experience before and after you were given Narcan?

TLDR: Have you been dosed with Narcan before after an overdose?? Did it send you into withdrawal, how long did this withdrawal last? How long did the Narcan last before the opiates started to creep back in? How long did you wait before you dosed again after being given the Narcan and did this dose get rid of the withdrawals caused by the Narcan? Di you have to take more than usual or did your normal dose have more or less of an effect than it normally would after you were given Narcan?

Thanks for answering, these are just some questions that I had  that I would like to ask somebody who has been dosed with it before as a result of an overdose. I am just personally curious and appreciate any answers you'd be willing to give",1541214430.0

I've been using Whisper for some time with no success to date but yesterday a guy from another city 250 miles away hits me up and says if I was willing to make the drive he could serve me. I told him that was a bit far for right now as I didn't have the time. Eventually he tells me he knows a guy in my city and asks if I'd like the number, I said sure but he couldn't remember the name and I got cold feet about making a cold call without any information whatsoever. When he text back later and ask if I'd had any luck with his guy I told him as much and he said he understood and lol'd. Not long after he sends me a screenshot, he had messaged his guy and cleared it! So I'm in, I hit up the guy and get served. My new friend and I continued to talk and it turns out that we had both lived in the same city in MO at the same time for some years, we talked about the spots we'd hang out and get fucked up, the places we'd lived (within blocks of one another at some points) and now we plan on getting together to hang out sometime. The guy he put me on turned out to be cool and hooked me up both last night and again today, so now I have a consistent plug here at home. My mission was a success and then some.

Me and 2 of my delinquent friends had skipped school and bought weed off this junkie who lived nextdoor. If you hit him up early before he got his fix he would sell a half oz of mid for $40. We pooled all our money together and sat in his house all day till it was dark out smoking this mid out of fat blunts.

Then one of their friends who I really didn't know came over he is a Latino guy with a brown skin complexion but when he showed up he was white as a ghost and he threw up in the back yard. I didn't think much of it just figured he was sick or something.

We were smoking more blunts and then he pulled out this bag of white powder. I asked him ""is this coke"" and with a smile on his face he nodded yes and asked me if I wanted some I said sure. It was probably a point  maybe a little less. I had done coke before and while it wasn't my thing I wasnt gonna turn down free drugs

He cut me out a little line and gave me a straw and then everyone started giggling, I shrugged it off and I railed it. The giggling got more intense and I got scared and said ""what did you just give me"" he said ""that was dope bro"" and everyone broke out in laughter. I was already 15 blunts deep at this point so I just nodded the fuck off woke up in his house at 4 am with 60 missed calls from my mom

Took a while but finally my doctor came in and she’s really nice but any way we just talked and I told her that I’ve been clean from H for 2 months and so she prescribed me them. 

A couple days before I went to the doctor, I told my mom she could hold onto them for me because I always run out early. Big mistake. 

Flashing forward to yesterday evening I wanted another pill and she wouldn’t give it to me and threatened to call/ email my doc and tell her and I take more than I should daily, that I trade them (which I’ve never done, truly) as well as some other stupid bullshit, which she did. Her and my doc were emailing today and it doesn’t look good but my mom won’t tell me what they talked about, besides my doc saying that it’s dangerous for me to be taking 6mg a day. 

I’m so fucking scared that I’m going to get fired all because my mom and I had a fight. Don’t get it twisted though, I will fight her (my mom) tooth and nail. Fucking.... ugh.

My other dealer i get heroin from and my heroin use has increased recently to the point I have had to take 2000$ from my husbands savings. Oh yeah and my husband doesn't know I do anything really. And he wouldn't ever know about the monies I took so I am not worried there. He thinks I sometimes take percocet and smoke pot. Which is true as well but regardless. I've already spent 900 this week on heroin and 300 on pills from my coworker. I don't take as many pills since I take the heroin and am thinking I can wean myself off the pills with what I already got from my coworker cause I really want to tell them to go fuk themselves. But then I see my heroin use getting even bigger and not to mention that my guy for that sexually harasses me every time i see him. So I feel fuked and stupid and I already know I am a horrible wife but even earlier today as I feel like I should at least drop the pills, my husband calls me and by the end if our conversation I am dying to go take a hit.

Furthermore, if any activity from my inaccessible account occurs which is dangerous, threatening, or otherwise concerning in a far reaching way that affects this community then of course do notify the mods. In all likelihood this shouoldn't be necessary and in most cases I'd imagine it's best to just notify me (if you believe me) at which point I may choose to notify mods. Hopefully none of this will matter.

It is most likely this is simply teh result of a Reddit policy change, as I see it no longer appears possible to create an account without an e-mail address. The only other possibility I can think of is that someone made too many unsuccessful attempts at signing into my account and got it locked.

I was out of town and found someone at my hotel that could get me stims.  However this individual said they had some fent,  I was very curios and tried some.  After smoking a tiny hit I was floating in the clouds.   Best feeling I have ever felt.  Next it was time for another hit.  This is the last thing I remember.   Apparently I went blue the individual with me knew what to do.   After reaching out to a neighbour for assistance Out came the naloxone and back I was.  I was delirious and confused.  They helped me get orientated cleaned me up and watched over me for the night.  I woke up to a clean unit all my money was still there and I'm grateful to be alive.  My mission is to find these 2 and thank them take them for dinner.   
It's interesting because I got the naloxone kit in case something I had was cut.  Maybe I only wanted to try fent because I knew the kit was there.  I'm glad to be here Today.

I’ve been clean off heroin for ~3 years. Shot for 4 used for 10. 
About 2 years ago I discovered Kratom and have been taking it everyday (2g 3x a day). Lately it just keeps me in homeostasis you could say the magic is gone. 

However over the past roughly 2 months - I’ve been very, I guess you’d say depressed. I just have no motivation to do anything whatsoever. I have hobbies and passions but I just get sucked into my bedroom and watch hours of videos I don’t care about. 

How can I fix this behavior? It’s more of a mindset. After my first DMT experience, which prompted my lasting sobriety I felt so at ease with the world and ‘knew my place’. I’m currently 10 classes away from completing my degree (finally) and I can honestly say I was happier, or atleast felt happier when I was fresh in sobriety than I do now. 

Have a great girlfriend - loving but distant parents, however not a lot of friends at college; I sincerely mean this - the kids at my hick town school are either 70IQ, extremely childish or just not my type of people. 

I’ll start off with this and I appreciate any advice / your experience. 

Thanks guys.

My doctor’s office screwed me on appointment scheduling this month, so I will be going through mild withdrawal for the next few days, as I only have about half of my prescribed dose of extended release pain medication to take until my next appointment. I’m wondering how best I can alleviate any side effects until then. Within the last few months I weened myself off of neurontin because I didn’t like how much it negatively affected me for minimal positive results. I still have a significant amount left - probably 90 400mg pills - that I could use if need be (I’ve read they help with withdrawal on here and elsewhere). 

So my question is, would I need to start taking them in a cycled dose, as they are typically prescribed, to see any relief from WD side effects? Or can you take them as needed? I really don’t want to start taking them around the clock again and have to ween myself back off. 

P.s. I can’t half my dose of painkillers because they are abuse-deterrent capsules with beads. 

Thanks for any help. ",1541167029.0

I started taking gabapentin about 2 years ago to treat my severe anxiety and panic disorder along with zoloftl and Wellbutrin when I admitted myself to detox from smoking heroin and meth. Gabapentin and buspar are about all the doctor was even willing to give me and I now know it was actually working....I think.  

Jump to a year ago and I relapsed and have been going strong ever since.  I'm. What I call a functional addict meaning I work 40 hrs a week and smoke enough heroin to stay well while keeping the anxiety at Bay and enough meth to make life go by a little quicker.  I quit the antidepressants about 3 months ago with no problem but trying to go cold turkey from gabapentin blows heroin withdraw out of the water.    

The withdraw include:..  
 loss of focus, 
loss of patience,
The weirdest stomach problems I've ever come across, it's not loose stools or constipation,.  everything is working normal my stomach just feels like it's always empty, no matter how much I eat.  
Suicidal thoughts, not that I really want to die but I constantly think how much better everyone around me would be happier
Memory loss
Energy loss
The worst symptom is.... BRAIN ZAPS, now I've been telling my fiance for a month that I get these weird jolts that go from the top of my head and run to the tips of my fingers, I called them brain jolts, only to Google and find out  there brain zaps.  If that wasn't coincidence....

All in all I just feel downright fucking weird., After writing them all down I know it looks like symptoms from the other drugs I'm doing but if I take 2 gabapentin when I start feeling bad or feel the even littlest symptom they go away.  

I want off this shit.  I can't go on like this.  It's pretty bad that the hardcore drugs are the least of my worries.  I don't drink so I can't try this beer method I've read about either.  If anyone has any ideas what I can do please let me know.  This shit sucks",1541151449.0

i finally made an account so i can post on here.

i hope you guys are doing better than i am tonight. i have been feeling like trash for the past few weeks and i don’t know how to cope with it.

i came out to the west coast about a year ago to get clean, went to treatment for 8 months and have been in different sober livings since i got out. i’ve relapsed several times, when everything seemed to be going my way i have to fuck it all up for myself, every fucking time. right now i have about 27 days clean, and i just got on vivitrol on monday.

i haven’t gotten a call or text from anyone at all in the past week, and i’m pretty sure the only other person in my sober living isn’t coming back, he’s been gone for 2 days with no explanation. i hate my house manager, he is super annoying and all he does is preach AA bullshit while he doesn’t work any program whatsoever, lies all the time, doesn’t even go to meetings, and leads an equally depressing existence.

i’ve never felt so lonely and depressed in my life. i think the only thing keeping me from ending my life is knowing how shitty that would be for my parents. ever since i stopped using i have been so socially awkward and find it difficult to talk to anyone. i go to meetings by myself because i have to, i sit alone and am too awkward to approach anyone.

what’s the point of being sober if it’s gonna be this excruciatingly miserable all the time. every day i wish i was dead about 50 times a day. sometimes i wish that my parents were already gone so i could kill myself without the guilt.

i don’t really know what to do anymore. thanks for reading me whine about my life and feel sorry for myself. i fucking hate myself.",1541146532.0

Be mindful of your use if you identify as a recreational drug user (and be reallyreallyreally mindful if/when you decide you wanna tango with harder substances that have cons that very easily have cons that outweigh the pros if you're not careful.) Sorry, I know most of you know all of this stuff, as most people on here are much further into their opiate career, having experienced the binges you only get once in a lifetime. The kind you know you'll chase forever, either knowing or unknowing that you're just chasing a dragon you won't even touch. Every day, I read about people on here suffering from the worst of withdrawals that I cannot even begin to experience as I have not even gotten to that point myself. I have obtained a wealth of knowledge from this subreddit, and I am not only unbelievably grateful that all of you exist, but also appreciative to have this a resource as the black sheep of all my friends. Opioids are an untapped market at my school, and what sets me apart from my friends is that I know for a fact that heaven isn't a place, but quite literally another word for morphinian structured drugs. As a result, life has never been the same, so I've been using r/opiates ever since I stared into this proverbial abyss. I love every moderator, dope addict, activist, and ally on this subreddit, and even with those descriptors, I still haven't really hit all of unique members this community really has. So please, do not think I am trying to preach sobriety. I just hope that by being as candid as possible I can reach that stupid but really relatable sixteen year old kid that's searching for information on the pills he found in his mom's drawer. Just like him, I didn't always use to run away from my problems, but somewhere along the way I guess I decided to become a full time escape artist, equipped fast fingers, a fixation on being perpetually high, a numbness so deep, and more, all during the formative years of my adolescence!

&#x200B;

Sorry for the long post guys. Aside from the amphetamine induced verbosity, it's been a little over a year since I first tried opiates, so I think I'm more reflective than usual for whatever reason. It's been a strangely euphoric yet lonely and unnerving journey, and I wish I never took those norcos my friend offered junior year.

I wish I never stole my grandpa's unused hydrocodone script, finding them by chance after being generously given double A batteries that I needed fior my television remote. (I kid you fucking not yall he had them in a plastic bag with all of his double/triple/rechargeable batteries) Imagine my face when I saw the label, literally just glancing at it by chance.  Hydrocodone M366, about 175 7.5mg norcs in total between two bottles that were prescribed in 2014. I got a few to take home with my batteries, and that night tv seemed so much better. I tried to chip, but that went downhill. If I hadn't fucked over one of my closest friends by selling him an amount I feel uncomfortable revealing, I would have most likely fell into addiction's claws by now.

More recently, I finally was able to get my hands on the elusive oxycodone, straight from a friend's mom's script. No fent', baby! Before that I had already been using the occasional morphine pill, trashy tram, and of course my trusty dusty norcos sporadically whenever I could to hold me over. Nowadays, I leap at every opportunity to get high. Sometimes it's in the form of a quick, five finger discount and other times I ask my ~~sources,~~ I mean my friends who have loved ones with scripts to steal from their grammas and mommys who need analgesia much more than I do.

Let's be real, we've all read this headline a million times. Honor roll student turned junkié inconsequential. Correction, inconsequential to everyone but anyone who ever cared. I mean it's easy to say I won't do heroin now but...truth be told, I'm not a fortune teller. Ok, that sounds ominous. It's clear to me what the right decision is, but right now I just want this honeymoon phase to be more like a lifetime. One of pinks, blues, and even the occasional Watson to take the edge off. The little guys need love too.

He was sick, drove to get some dope, shot some in his car, and started to make his way home. His heroin was cut with fent, he nodded, drove up onto the sidewalk, and then hit and killed 1 child and seriously injured 2 others. He got 30 years in prison because he couldn't wait an hour to drive to his house to get high.

Yes, withdrawing is one of the worst feelings in the world. But I'm sure that killing someone feels even worse, and I know for a fact that prison is worse too. I've only been in for a year and some change, and that was bad enough, but going in with a death weighing on your psyche, knowing that you will be an old fuck when you get out will make it so much worse, and that's if you even make it out.

We both work super long hours every single day (he gets a couple days off a week, I don't take days off at all) to pay the bills and pay for h. So trying to quit cold turkey has been super hard because we can't function at our jobs while withdrawing. My biggest problem is that I can't sleep while withdrawing and it gives me horrible anxiety to think about staying up for days feeling like absolute garbage. 

I tried to quit by taking a suboxone strip one day which took away some withdrawals for a few days but I still needed opiates in my system after the sub stopped working. So I went right back to it. (We don't have any hookup for subs anymore btw and don't have the resources for a suboxone/methadone clinic in our area.) 

My fiance has tried to quit before but he couldn't do it while I was still going out to pick up h, smoking it in the house, etc. And we can't stand to see each other sick so if one of us doesn't have h we'll share with each other. 

So we decided to try to taper off until we're down to less than .1 of h a day or every other day then quitting. We've already started tapering just because we don't really enjoy it anymore and are really only smoking enough to get well instead of getting high. We've gotten down to about .3 over the course of the day and plan to taper down to .2 over the weekend then hopefully get to a point a day next week. 

Has anyone tried this? Do yall have any advice for us? I've tried kratom before and it was the only thing that could put me to sleep while withdrawing, would that be a worthy investment (and how much do you think we should get)? ",1541126083.0

You might be a junky if:

You've ever went through a drive through and ordered a cup of water with no ice then asked for a spoon at the window when getting your water. ""Hey I don't tell you how to eat your water.""

You've ever gone into a random restaurant (like 1 of those little Mexican ones) and asked for a piece of aluminum foil.

If you have a preference of flavor of Gatorade to shoot up with when you can't get water. ""I like lemon lime bc it reminds me of dillys but hate orange bc it reminds me of subs.""

If your mom hides the spoons from the new set she bought to replace the last ones that ""disappeared"" and makes you leave collateral whenever you want to use one.

If when you have to have blood drawn you tell the nurse exactly where their best chance of success is. ""There's literally nowhere else but right here ma'am/sir.""

If the methadone clinic is like the bar cheers for you because people are the same and you wanna go where everyone knows your name. 

If someone says 1 of their friends ""has the blues"" and you immediately wonder how much they are instead of what they're sad about.

If during conversation someone says ""he's got a good point"" you think ""I wonder if he has extras I've been using mine for way too long"" instead of what they're right about. 

The smell of cleaning products your local gas station or the gas station near your plug uses in their bathroom sends you fiending bc you're used to only smelling it when you're about to do a shot.

You have ""novelty flowers/roses"" just laying around. (Several times I've given these to ex gfs or girls I've liked and they thought it really sweet and had no clue where they came from lmao)

The cashier at your local grocery store knows you as the guy/gal who always only buys aluminum foil, sour patch kids and sometimes chore boy.

You know exactly where you can sell gift cards for cash.

You've ever searched for ""roofing tar"" on craigslist.

Someone's talking about guns and says 12 gauge and you think ""holy shit that'd be like 1 of those little stirrers for coffee I couldn't use that.""

Instead of the high visibility shirts construction workers wear being ""safety orange"" or ""tang orange"" you think of it as ""rig cap orange"".

By the time you get down to your last or ""lucky"" cig in the pack you have to cut part of the filter off to be able to smoke it because you've been pinching pieces off of the end of it to use a filter when doing shots.

You fear going #2 bc it's been 2 weeks and you know its going to be excruciating. (TMI warning! When I was on methadone having to shit put the fear of God into me bc how bad it hurt and looked like someone poured Hawaiian punch in the toilet after I was done.)

You know every single pharmacy around that's 24 hour so you can get your script at 12:01 am on refill day.

You consider lean a ""pussy drug."" (I hate hearing people say oh that rapper has such a severe drug problem he's always drinking lean lol what are they 8 years old?)

The sound of pills shaking in a bottle (west virginia mating call lol) gets your attention over anything else. Like a shark smelling a drop of blood in millions of gallons of water you could hear it in a loud concert.

If you're a dude who's had to regularly fake orgasms. ""No baby I came also I promise. Lol.""

I must be one of the lucky ones, because I asked my Dr less than 3 weeks ago and their office already has the medication there and ready for me.

That said, I've been pretty excited to go in about 2 weeks for my injection. My only reservation/concern was actually that the 300mg might be TOO HIGH of a dose for me. I know I could be easily stable around ~4mg/day, and currently trying more around ~8mg...but I think starting the sublocade might be more like 16, and all day long.

Seems as though some of the blood plasma concentrations support that too, where average & low are close, but on high side some people have DOUBLE the bupe in their blood on sublocade vs 12mg subutex (and still significantly more than 24mg subutex).

This does not seem to bode well for tapering down.  But then I found this:

> **“After steady-state has been achieved (4-6 months), patients discontinuing SUBLOCADE may have detectable plasma levels of buprenorphine for twelve months or longer. “**

Wait, so...after I drop to the 100mg dose, if lets say after this initial 6 month approval is up I decide I want to come off...

I'm wondering if this means it may be possible to quit and allow the sublocade to slowly lower your blood plasma (because the depot doesn't fully dissolve in 30 days, more like 60 so I think you're still getting residual from previous months). 

Also the fact the say it will be detectable in plasma for TWELVE MONTHS or longer makes me especially question whether maybe these depots continue releasing a significantly lower dose for a much longer period than actually advertised.

So far, I've only found 1 person who had claimed to stopped--they were about 60 days post last 100mg shot and said they felt great. I wonder if withdrawal would still come, though. Or maybe the plasma reduces so slowly with this method that it makes coming off easy?

I don't know, and I think it probably needs to be studied significantly more.

**TL;DR - Invidor says “After steady-state has been achieved (4-6 months), patients discontinuing SUBLOCADE may have detectable plasma levels of buprenorphine for twelve months or longer. “**

**WTF does that mean? How is it a depot that is supposedly releasing 30 days of meds going to still be in my blood a year later?** I just don't want to set myself up to be even extremely more dependent upon buprenorphine than I would be if I stuck to my pills. Guess my issue there is I need to actually take my meds to be efficacious, but yeah.",1541107489.0

I’ve never taken an opioid, minus one time when I was 13 and needed surgery. So:

What are the doses that people commonly take? Is there a dose that you would advise against because it would feel too good and cause an instant problem? I have four pills of hydrocodone 10-325. I don’t even know what that number means. I have five pills of 2mg hydromorphone. I take Wellbutrin, 450 mg daily, and periodically take methylphenidate (as concerta). I would have no issues taking a break from the stim- I do that already. Overall, I’m very undecided about this and want to make an informed decision, including people’s personal experiences, not just stats about addiction. How do the two drugs match up (hydrocodone and hydropmorphone)? What is the difference in feeling? What are good drug combos- I have a 3 fl-oz bottle of delsym and a bunch of weed. I would intuitively avoid mixing stims and opioids- how dangerous is that? I would probably not avoid taking an opioid with weed, but I’m super unsure about DXM. Is it safe to mix hydrocodone or hydromorphone with XR DXM (delsym brand is pure DXM but it lasts like 12 hours)? Is it safe to mix those plus weed? Does combining an opioid with weed cause an increase in chance for addiction? Thanks for your responses, guys. If I pop anything here, I know I’m playing with fire, and I’m not going in without every precaution I can take. I’m leaning towards not taking them, but I kinda want to know... 

 But that’s how people begin awful spirals. So your anecdotes and experiences are going to help me do some risk/reward assessment here. I also wouldn’t take opioids like that more than once a season (I always make an exception for 1sts with a new substance, though- I have a “test the waters” dose, but then I can actually have the full experience a week later. After that, though- it’s strict). I also only have limited quantities so that there’s extra incentive to save what is there for very unusual occasions.



TL;DR:

1st timer with opioids, have plenty of experience with other drugs. 

Hydrocodone- what’s the normal range of doses?
Hydromorphone- what’s the normal range of doses? How does it compare to hydrocodone? 

Combos:
Weed+either opioid= safe and enjoyable?
What about pure, extended release DXM+either opioid? All three? What about both opioids at once? All four? I’m guessing that’s a bad idea but I’m leaving no question unasked today lol.



Thanks guys! It’s impossible to say what would or would not have happened if you weren’t here for me to ask, but there’s an undeniable chance that your answers could keep me from ruining my life or worse. I think of myself as a smart guy, and I’m doing plenty of (internet) research on top of this, but I just want y’all to know that I’m sincerely grateful there’s a community here for me to ask.

Should have never picked it up to begin with.. But what's done is done, and I'm ready to stop.. its not even touching my pain anymore.. I have a small amount left and I've been microdosing to make the withdrawls a little easier. I only started because I had to stop using cannabis, and I can't get an increase in pain management meds from my family doctor (I get 30 5/325 oxy a month, which was manageable when I could use cannabis.) So I guess my question is, how can I manage my pain when this is gone? Do I have other options for pain management that will work better than the oxy that I can discuss with my doctor? Cbd is illegal in my state, kratom isn't an option for me. (I've used it in the past, it helps, but only for 2 weeks and then nothing. Plus they are trying to make this illegal in my state as well.) I've used up all of the physical therapy my insurance will cover, I have a tens unit, heating pad, take Epsom salt baths. I can't take nsaids because of stomach issues. I changed my diet to the best of my ability..ive tried gabapentin, lyrica, topamax, cymbalta, savella (all cause severe depression and/or anxiety) I'm at a loss. I can't use cannabis due to a job (fake urine isn't an option as I have adhd and am prescribed adderall so I have to test positive for this). With the weather getting colder my pain is worsening..

On Saturday at 2pm he text me asking to bring over some herb, he had valium + very powerful h so wanted to do a trade with me (usually once or twice a week we will do this trade as we both benefit). However I was too lazy to do it even though its only a 15 min walk... Then 20 mins after decideding I'm not going I get a text from him ""woooo, just found a box of valium and a box of pregabs!! Don't worry about the weed this will be enough to put me in a real party mood, just could have done with someone to get on it with that's all..."" that's the last I heard from him that day. Me and him always get together to do valium, pregabs and H, it's our weekly ritual. Sunday goes by, his phones off the whole day which is very very strange... No phone means no drugs which means something is defo wrong.. His gf phoned me up Sunday asking if I can over and check up on him (I have a key to the house since we are really really close.) I longed her off!!! I just had just finished a 12 hour shift and longed her off because I didn't wanna walk  35 mins to my mates then 40 mins home.. So I longed it off Sunday. Come Monday his girlfriend is now begging me to go over and check on him, we both know something is definitely wrong now, his girlfriend phoned round all hospitals and old bill stations he wasn't in any of them. So Monday night after finishing a 12 hour shift it is time to finally Check on the man, big Al . I have to bite the bullet and go check on Al, my best friend. He would do anything for me, anything I needed at all he was always there. Anyway I leave work and start the slowest walk ever, really , really hoping he is just shacked up with some girl and ignoring his girlfriend (this happened quite often when he would go off the radar.) 

I arrive at the house, all the lights are on that's a good sign!!! The stupid bastard is just super fucked up on valium and h, nothing new!!! I open up the door have a little look around, no one was there what a fucking relief!!

I bent down to pet one of the dogs and then I see it. My best friend , lying facedown in a pool of vomit... Smashed up face where he hit it on the way down, the the 2 small dogs jumping on him trying to wake him up.. The way he was laying just looked so uncomfortable, legs, arms and hands all twisted in a weird way It was the most horrible thing I have ever seen in my whole life...

They reckon he died at 3pm Saturday. If I had went over on Saturday when he text me and wasn't so lazy I know for a fact he would still be here now. He might have still went over yes but I would have been able to get him help and save him!!! I hate myself for being so fucking lazy.

Sorry I just had to rant because I'm a secret addict. Not many people In real life know I use so I can't talk about it to many people... He was my best friend, my using buddy, we done everything together!! I had to make the call to his girlfriend and their 14 year old daughter. Hardest thing I have ever done. ... Im gunna miss him so fucking much. I cannot get the sight of finding him out of my head. ",1541031995.0

I have been doing it everyday 1-3 times a day. I do rather large amounts.

These past few weekends, I've been trying to get high off of oxycodone IR, and I keep having to up my dose. Keep in mind I haven't done any opioids besides kratom before. I have made it to 120 MG and all it gives me is a very mild high. Is it my sensitivity to opioids doing this or tolerance? Its beyond crazy! $120 dollars for a mild high is such a waste of money. Does anyone know why this is happening and how to prevent it?? 120 mgs Is a ridiculous amount for someone whos never done real opioids before. I can probably up it to 200mg and still not nod/have a heavy high at all. No one told me it does this before starting kratom, if its infact the kratom doing this.

**Tizanidine** 4mg pills x 90 (This is for muscle relaxant and I hear it acts on the same receptors as Clonidine a2 adrenergic)  


**Clonazepam** 2mg tabs x 5 (I'm planning on using this for sleep aid)

**Xanax Alprazolam** 4mg bars x2 (I could get more of these but they proved very potent sleep inducers)  


I don't plan on using the benzos for much longer than 3ish days thru the worst of the WD  


other OTC Meds I have are **Loperamide** for the runs also it does help with cravings ime

I also have **Melatonin** \+ **5HTP** for sleep and mood booster  


anything else you guys might recommend? Also I have no idea how much I'm supposed to dose  the Lyrica I know i can dose upto 400mg a day maybe 200 thru out the day and 200 at bed time. but the other meds I'm not sure about

The kid is as dirty and desperate as any of the pigeons in the street.


He holds both dirty palms out and open while he does this sort of dance like a whirling dervish or something and chants his petitions for spare change or cigarettes to anyone and everyone walking by. No one pays attention. His voice has taken on a sour wino rasp, moving toward but still short of the way freight riders croak like bullfrogs when they speak. A vulgar and putrid aura of dishonesty and cigarette ash hangs on him. His face is dirty. Several bits of black scab stick out of the skin on his nose, and a few wispy hairs hang from his chin and lip. I stand on the sidewalk under the overhang in front of those ticket booths or whatever they are.

“Hey, kid!” 

He continues his dance. A woman pinches a few coins between her fingertips and hands them to him. He smiles at her. She tries a smile but her lip stick quivers, betraying her revulsion. 

“Hey, kid!” I yell out a little louder this time. 

He looks around. I pull that soft paper pack of Winston’s from my pocket and finger one loose and step out to give it to him. 

“Here,” I say. 

“Hey. Thanks, man!”

He puts it in his mouth and pulls out a lighter and pulls in the smoke. It takes him a moment to realize that he knows me.

“Hey. You’re Randy C. Huh?”

“I am.” We shake. His hand is dirty in mine. 

“What’s up? Haven’t seen you since… since the meeting. I think. That’s right. I never made it to that game.”

“What happened?”

“My moms found a foil in my room.”

“You were smoking it?”

“Yeah.”

“You shoot though right?”

“Unless I just relapsed or am trying to keep it together or something, but yeah. See?”
He holds out the crook of his arm revealing the holes in his arm, pierced places where he tries to chase away his pain. I nod. My own are hidden away under the new button up I’m wearing. 

“What’re you trying to get into?”

“I’m sick, man.” He’s not lying. Watery mucus runs from each nostril. His pupils stretch to hide the brown of his irises. “Got like seven bucks and some change.” 

“Where you gonna pick up?”

“It’s hard to get anything for less than 20.” Those dirty fingers move up to his face and pull the hair hanging over his eyes. He pulls his head back like he just realized something. “Oh man. Are you getting high?”

I don’t say anything.

“You are, huh?” He says. His voice too loud. He laughs. “What you got?”

“I got what I need, bro. I’m asking you what you’re trying to do and who you’re going to see about it.”

“There’s this stuff going around. White powder. You taste it, yet?”

“I’ve seen it.”

“Yeah. Guess there’s this dude they’re calling the Vonnegut or something. He’s the one brought it around. It’s been all over the place.”

“What you gonna do if you only got seven bucks?”

“My ex-sister-in-law strips later tonight.”

“So?”

“So, she’ll be looking to pick up something big. Usually does. I get it for her. She always breaks me off fat.”

“I got something at my place. I’m headed home now. If you follow me, I’ll get you well and even throw you some threads, bro. You’re looking pretty hard up.”

He looks at the stains and dirt on the front of his shirt as if this is news. There are a few holes from embers in the fabric and a black streak of soot wiped from a hot metal spoon. “Really?”

“Yeah, bro. I’ll help you out.”

“Man! You’re a lifesaver, bro.”

“Don’t trip. Let’s go.”

I just moved to a new big city in central south USA. From some advice I found on here I downloaded whisper and after a few scammers/weirdos I found a plug. The plug was about 20 min away from my house, in order for them to help me out I needed to;

1. Pick them up (20 min)
2. Drive them to the house back on my side of town (20 min)
3. Drive them back home (20 min)
4. Give them $10 and then drive myself back home (20 min)

The house is only a couple minutes from where I live. The plug said it was open 24/7 and during the 5min I was there (stayed in the car) I saw two other people walk up. I also asked the plug to get me $80 but Im guessing I got about half of that. How bad of an idea would it be for me to just go back to the house by myself? I could either walk up or ask one of the other people around the area what the deal is?

So I've been mostly clean for almost a year, but have taken subs maybe 5 or 10 times when I just need to scratch the itch and feel high. The other day I was dumpstering the grocery store and found a bunch of hummus, so I kept digging and found a bag full of empty pill bottles! I've been in the middle of nowhere for the last month working so I guess maybe it's such a small town that the pharmacy is lenient about how they dispose of medical stuff? Anyway I threw that shit in the car and brought it home to go thru it, and sure enough found a bottle of lean (codeine and guaifenesin) with like 100mg left in it. Y'all know I poured a LaCroix (lol) in it and shook it up for a sec and drank that in about two sips. I don't remember feeling too much but I did have trouble cumming later that night so it definitely did something, lol. 


Also, how many of y'all are mostly clean and no longer addicted to your DoC but get shit for still getting high occasionally? I was really addicted to dope for years, I say I have ten months of clean time even tho I've abused subs a bit and done one shot in that time. Some people say I should restart every time I relapse a little bit but I honestly don't think that's fair and it's really complicated to explain; it's easier to just say I have ten months clean? I guess I could say ""I have ten months since I was strung out"" but I haven't been actually strung for a couple years, I was just chipping... I still count that as using tho cause I just lived my life for the weekend so I could get high anyway. I don't go to meetings or anything, idk. ",1541015620.0

My wife gets a script for 160 a month. After ripping through them a week early for the 100th time and paying insane amounts for pills she convinced me to try and get a dope hook up. I went on Craigslist here in Oregon, got a lot of replies and fortunately met someone cool that makes things fairly easy and I pick up 1 G a day of BTH for the past 3 months. I pay $90 a G - I’m assuming that’s a standard price in the PNW. We also plug it, neither my wife nor I have ever used needles. I’ve been beginning to notice inconsistencies with the quality but being I’m new to the scene I don’t really know what to look out for. Sometimes when I mix it with water even though it’s really dark it will be sort of a blond or light brown color when mixed with water when usually it makes the water super dark. I also notice the last 2-3 grams just make me feel like I have 10 lb weights on my eyelids - I don’t feel high at all, but also am not sick. Hoping to figure out what to look out for, what real deal BTH looks/feels like, what the sh*t I’m getting is or isn’t, any other tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.",1540980527.0

First of all let me say hello to all the great people of r/opiates. Who I assume are all very attractive as well as intelligent. I hope you all are at least well if not high. Sober by choice falls in with well and bravo on maintaining your sobriety. The cops havent got ol lobster yet though there was a close encounter where I literally had to run lol. It's very touching that some of you have said you're up for writing me and throwing a little money on my books when I inevitably get locked up for this probation violation bullshit. They'll rubber band my claws and throw ol lobster in the lobster tank with all the other poor unfortunate crustaceans. But that's for another time and until then I'm going to get high and enjoy my freedom. Self care . . . I'm treatin meee right. Hell yea, I'm gonna beee alright. 

So I fucked up yesterday and didn't get any $ so I didn't get any dope so yesterday evening I was sick and getting sicker. My good friend gave me a tiny bit of dope she'd got. It was a miniscule amount but enough to get me ok. I was even able to sleep some on and off. This morning when I forced myself up out of my sleeping bag where I'd been tossing and turning for a couple of hours trying in vain to fall back asleep I knew I had to get dope. Which requires money. I tried everything I could think of and eventually resorted to pan handling. I was sick as fuck and desperately needing dope. Every step I took felt so very draining. I could only walk for like 5 minutes until I had to sit down and rest. I walked a couple miles like this and after like 3 hours I had enough money to get enough dope to get myself well. Not high, but well. 


I took the bus to the stop nearest my plug and set out walking the nearly 3 miles to his house praying he'd be home. I don't have phone service right now so I'm that asshole who just shows up and that's what I did. The walk was excruciating. I was already so drained that I didn't think I could make it but I did. He turned out to be home and he only took 45 fucking minutes weighing out my little bit of dope. After getting my shit I had to walk all the way back to the bus stop to do my shot in the bathroom of the Exxon bc he was being shitty and wouldn't let me do it at his house. He has had like 5 people die there from overdoses but still, it was a shit move. I go into the bathroom and open my little tiny folded up piece of paper, so very truly happy that relief was imminent, aaand it's all fucking coke. He mixed up my order and gave me girl instead of boy. I was crushed. The trek there and back had felt like climbing mount Everest to dopesick me and it was all for nothing. Absolutely soul crushing. I had only 1 option available to me which was to walk there and back again. Fuck! It was like waking up on Xmas morning to find out Xmas was cancelled. I was somewhat mad but more than anything I was just crushed. My spirit was nearly destroyed looking at that pearly white cocaine. Fml. I walked back to his house to get him to trade it out. After the old, greedy 1 handed dope man took his sweet time weighing the coke to make sure I hadn't pinched some he weighed out the boy to replace it with. No lie this man sometimes takes an hour to weigh a point. I couldn't make it take that long no matter what I did. He uses a little scoop to get a tiny bit and ever so gingerly taps it out onto the scale. But he's always so high he nods and takes too long between scoops and the scale turns off and he has to start all over. And god help you if you rush him. He'll also start talking and telling stories and get side trekked from the task at hand. I go back and forth between thinking he's incredibly high and just incompetent and that's why it takes such an insane amount of time and thinking he's lonely and knows he can get away with whatever if someone needs dope so he can tell his jokes and stories to a captive audience. I can't decide why he takes so very long but he does. It's way worse for attractive female customers. When the girl who gave me enough dope to get by yesterday goes he makes it take like 2 hours. I went with her last week and he no joke made weighing a half gram take an hour and 45 min. I'm positive it's bc she's hot and he wants to spend time with her. Anyway I got my shit and sat down right there and did my shot in his living room. I was like this is happening and you'll have to physically stop me to prevent it. He wasn't happy about it but oh well. 

I just went back a 2nd time to get enough for the morning but he took so damn long I missed the last bus. Also the bus must have came a little early but still, him taking a fucking hour screwed me. Now I'm stuck at this Exxon and have to walk nearly 7 miles to get where I'm staying. I don't know if I can do it. I didn't wear socks today bc I was so sick I didn't feel like finding some and putting them on and I've already walked so much today that my feet hurt and my legs are sore. Also due to no socks I'm getting a gnarly blister on my heel so if I walk 7 miles it's going to be absurdly excruciating. And to top it all off in a moment of weakness knowing I'd be walking 7 miles or huddling somewhere all night trying to keep warm I went ahead and did my morning shot now so I could at least be high tonight. Damned present-me always fucking over poor poor future-me. 

How are all of you lovely people doing? I know there's many out there with real problems. Not like my whiny bullshit lol but I hope you are all doing great and had much better day than me since my problems are all petty and trivial and of my own making. Damn present-me. He and past-me must really have it out for future-me.

Havent really gotten over 2 weeks sober but have decided ill be taking a tolerance break at least until the holidays.

My question is today will be my 2nd and last day of using a benzo to help with sleep and anxiety. My doc has prescribed me as much trazodone as I want since I dont really want to be using benzos on a regular basis. Im wondering if anyone has had any experience with trazadone. Also interested in dosing as Ill most likely only be using it for sleep and maybe some anxiety when it gets bad.

Since abusing opiates for the past 5 years, also been on and off of suboxone many times, I have developed a very scary issue where breathing does not feel natural to me anymore. All of the time. It keeps me awake at night. And I've visited many doctors who all say everything is completely fine and it's anxiety. I can't believe how hard it is to get someone to have an open mind (Well i can, because otherwise i would have listened and stopped abusing drugs along time ago). I've found a few articles showing studies on how opiates can affect respiratory control. I mean it makes sense, right? Something that can completely stop us from breathing could possibly change how it feels to breath right? Well this situation has left me with no relief, since I'm trying to just maintain on suboxone, which doesn't feel right anyways, and I get no other relief from anything ever. I'm very scared to be living the rest of my life like this unless I find any answers. Anyone else thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. Here's one of the articles.

It's certainly better than nothing. In my experience it feels like an unobtainably high dose of tramadol mixed with oxycodone. My guy ran out of anything good so im left with this shit, i tried racking it but after half a line my nose was bleeding and on fire... i dont even know if its smokable. i have a relatively high tolerance but i wanted to be safe with this stuff because it also acts on the nonephedrine receptor.

 i took 300mg first up (3 pills, chewed, empty stomach) and after about 40 minutes i started getting effects. at first i was getting the head tension and relaxation associated with oxy but then that wore off after an hour and i was left feeling heavy and... wierd. i was getting tiny auditory hallucinations and my hands were trailing. don't get me wrong i do a fuckload of oxy and ive never got that shit before. i like my psychedelics but not unexpectedly, this made me uncomfortable and took away from the experience i wanted. i ate another 200mg to ""mellow myself"" (get real you're just a fein cunt). this made me better and worse, im so unsure about this drug, i started thinking fuck what if its like tram and i start foaming from the mouth but that never happened. 

It almost felt like speed and low dose fentanyl at some points because i was energised, heavy but empty. i dont even know what this post is really, i just want to hear if anyone else with proper opiate experience has tried this shit... because the withdrawals suck too. im sitting in my backyard feeling shit in too many different ways compared to my usual withdrawals. i feel like im coming off antidepressants AND opiates...

 i was looking for something in our garage when i found what looked like a burner phone. as soon as i opened the text messages my heart sank. dozens of texts going back months with a dope dealer. even more texts with his friends about how he does it almost every week and a whole lot of other stuff. i felt like i was going to vomit. i kinda always suspected but whenever i asked about it he always denied it 100%. i feel so betrayed and humiliated. i never hid my relapses from him and thought he was being honest with me too. all this time i felt like a failure cuz i still did pills but he was doing a whole lot more this entire time and letting me believe it was all in my head when i asked about it. i just don't understand. i never judged him for his addiction. i always stayed by his side even when he treated me like shit. i just dont know where to go from here. he's my whole world and i cant imagine my life without him. i thought we were in this together but now i just feel like a fool.

I met a guy outside of a jail downtown a couple weeks after being here and managed to bring it up in conversation that I was new here and in need of a buzz so he made a few phone calls on my phone and set me up to meet his friend. Well his friend was sketched by the situation (which I dont blame him. Friend calls and says he met a girl looking for heroin right outside the jail while he's waiting to get picked up for his work release) and set me up with someone else. I end up meeting this guy at a gas station down the road from my house, he's like 6'5"", long, greasy, slicked back hair, missing most of his bottom teeth, long, dirty nails, his shirt was tight but the neck was all stretched out, and he's driving this beautiful BMW. At this point I can't figure out if he's the plug or not. He tells me I have a beautiful smile and takes $10 off the price of the bag, cool. I make the transaction quick and get back to my car to take a better look at the stuff (I posted a picture of it in a post when I got it) I'd never seen dope like that before so I was skeptical. I did a bump and turns out it was amazing shit. So the next day I call this guy again, he doesnt know where to get any more. He's not the plug unfortunately, he's a tweaker and would not stop hitting on me and making weird comments, I'm a lesbian but if I were into men it would NOT be him. So I go back to the jail and wait for my friend to come out and see if we can try again. Well there's a rehab next to this jail and dude's got an ex who goes there court ordered. He introduces us and I tell her if she can help me I will buy her some. We go and meet her dude and he does the drive by thing, so I don't have to worry about her pinching it or anything because it goes straight from his hand to mine, amazing. I start doing this same thing about every other day, pick her up, meet her dude, break her off some, drop her off. It works so well any time I'm in need she's ready to go. I didn't mind going through a middle man (woman) this way bc his shit is so good, cheap, I dont shoot any more, and I make pretty good money so it's fine giving her a couple points. Well last week my little friend was taking a long time to text back and wasn't making much sense when she would text back. Finally met up with her and she's so barred out she cant keep her eyes open, her head up, nothing! She would call him then forget where he said to meet. She would fall asleep while the phone was ringing. She kept mumbling, he couldn't understand her, I was dealing with her for 4 hours before we finally got to meet this guy! It was the day before my birthday... I just wanted to get my shit and get fucked up all night. Since then she has been barred out and completely impossible to work anything out. The dude I met at the jail ended up getting busted bringing crystal in and got locked up, no more work release. So I call ol' tweaky and see if he can help. Which to my surprise, he does, but it's fuckin garbage dope. Spent 50 and did it all in about 2 hours. The next day I try again, spend 100, it's different shit but equally as garbage as the last. So now I'm screwed until home girl comes back to reality. I get so jealous when I see everyone posting about their plugs and shit because this is the first time in my using career I've been loaded with money but no connect! If you've read this far I appreciate you, wondering if anyone has any advice about finding a plug??? No more middle men. I'm visiting home this weekend and gonna pay my old guy a visit, love him, but after that I'm back to drys-ville.

9splyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9splyo/shame_and_regret/,5,https://redd.it/9splyo,Minuted,Shame and regret...,"So I used to post here a lot a few years ago. Since I got on buprenorphine I've posted less. But recently, I was given weekly pick ups. At first it wasn't too bad but slowly as my dose was reduced I found myself using an extra days worth here and there leaving myself short. This culminated recently in me using a bit of anything I could to get through to my pickup, morphine, codeine etc. But the other day I used heroin for the first time in a few years. I'm either too honest or stupid to hide this fact from my loved ones so now I feel like shit making them worry. I don't inject, and even smoking I always smoke a small amount first but even buying off of UK vendors on the darknet there's still that chance there could be that little bit of fentanyl that could end you. Just feel awful making my mum worry about me like that. I'm pretty honest with her about when I feel suicidal but I always tell her that I'd never do it. And I never would, not while she's alive. but this feels different, like I've actively caused her to fear for my life, as dramatic as that sounds. People tend to associate heroin with death. And not without reason.

To top it off, I messaged my key worker at the clinic being honest about how I've been struggling and using on top of my buprenorphine. Haven't heard back but I usually hear from him by tomorrow so there's a good chance they'll just kick me off of the program altogether. I'm really hoping they'll take into account my (admittedly belated) honesty and allow me to go back onto daily pick ups at a higher dose if I promise to engage with their services a bit more. (anyone in the UK have any experience with this? I go to spectrum CGL, won't post the town though)

No real point to this post, just shame and regret I guess. But I just can't imagine living without opiates. whether it's a daily maintenance dose or an occasional binge they're one of the few things that I find myself looking forward to. That's sad, but it's better than having nothing I guess?",1540917467.0

I liked the morphine, I REALLY liked the lean, she gave me 3 doses, drank one with her, drank one at home and polishing off my third dose, added into the mix is also a few joints and a fruity pebbles bar edible, this may be the closest I've ever come to catching a nod.

I had been taking 15mg + 50mg today and I really like the feeling with this dose, however it's not super strong (not the aim, I'm doing it at work) and I would like to take it a bit further tonight at home and make some music.

I was planning of taking 20mg and I want to potentiate the fuck out of this dose but not be completely floored. 

The idea was to have a beer or two, 50mg (100 maybe ?) dph as well as 40/50mg of dxm before taking the oxy. 

I need to somewhat be able to function, but not too much since I'm comfortable with making music (guitar/synth), I don't need to think about it so much, but I need to be able to move lol. I do have a tolerance but it's kind of low, last time doing opiate was 2 months ago. 

What would you do if you were me ? Take everything ? Just dph/oxy/beer or dxm/oxy/beer ?

Currently on 75mg which holds me fine 85% of days.. the days where it doesn’t work I feel it’s a psychological thing anyway, that a higher dose might prevent but it’s going to read it’s ugly head no matter what.. 
Basically I’ve had it with Psychiatry being accepted as part of the Medical Institution. My Doc, an ‘addiction specialist’, has a particularly egregious racket. Generally for 15minute appointments he’s charging $300(luckily with insurance I only pay like $80, but insurance ain’t free), where a script is written that will need to be rewritten in a months time(sometimes 6,8 weeks, sometimes 2weeks).  Because the accepted practices don’t actually get people well, his list of patients generally only tends to grow, taking advantage of patient’ family’s Hope and Faith, while Addict’s who need a diagnosis, who want treatment, who have health insurance, & who have means to pay the rest keep coming back.

Shit that turned into a rant.. I’m highly doubtful that any of these docs would greenlight say jumping off MMT for doc monitored short-term maintenance with a short acting opiate like oxy or morphine, in order to attempt a 5 day detox and an opiate-free life.. particularly free of the dr’s, scripts and liquid handcuffs.. but any known cases may bolster my case, or any other ways to kick it y’all might’ve heard of besides methadone/bupe maintenance ??

These are the instructions for shooting

* After preparing your shot, set the needle aside and wait to inject.
* Add about 1 milliliter (about 1/4 of a teaspoon) of clean water into the spoon or cooker.
* Hold the blue end of the test strip and insert the other end into the liquid.
* Allow the liquid to travel up the strip into the test area. (This takes less than 30 seconds.)


Would adding water once I have my point on tin foil, fuck up the smoke? Like, how do I go about this? If anyone has any experience with this, please help an opioid out. Thanks.


**Edit:** The portion I tested was negative for fentanyl.

And forgive me for the text I'm using the talk to text feature because I am high.

So I have been going through intense bouts of pain recently and things just have not been going well. One of my old plugs randomly hit me up and told me he has some fire for me to try. He told me unless I'm sick I cannot come over and try because he said I would not be able to give a good read then. Very understandable. I haven't had access to a car for about a week. The car here finally got fixed by the mechanic when he just happened to call it was a true JJ moment. 

Okay so anyway I go over to his project building in the hood. He would not let me take the dope with me. He said I have to do it in front of him. And he never has done this in the past but I was legitimately sick like I said so I came through anyway. When he leads me to the top of the stairs of his decrepitude project building he brings me into a two-room apartment. There was 8 black dudes in there all of them were dealers. What I wasn't expecting was they pulled out a s*** ton of different kinds of dope. They know my tolerance is through the f****** roof so they were loading literal $20 shots into my spoon and I was getting high as fuk with each shot.

After the first shot, the other two were a little pointless on the count of me being loaded af after first one Haha. Sure af didn't say no though lmao. Still got some of a doggie bag they sent me off with 😁

I don't talk to the original friend anymore but I still hang with this guy. He is really the closest thing I have to a friend even though he is a pain in my ass most of the time. I was never good at being social or making friends and the few I had   
I drove away years ago. 

&#x200B;

I spent a year out of town kinda dealing with some shit with my ex. I went back to the city last summer and started hanging out with my best bud again. The first day we hung out last summer (2017) he offered me a Percocet as he was taking one while we were walking down the street. 7.5mg of oxycodone and it got me a real good buzz. Within a week I asked him to grab me a few next time he picks up. Within a month I was calling his plug directly to get roxy 30's. That's how I got into this game in the first place. 

&#x200B;

I managed to chip until spring of this year when some personal shit got me doing dope and poppin' pills on the regs.

&#x200B;

Last week I am dealing with some shit and my best bud texts me that he has a line on 100 Pink 10mg Roxy from someone who doesn't know their worth and doesn't want to sell them like that anyway.  So this guy agrees to sell us 100 10mg Roxies for $600. I'm busy with shit so I can't go meet my buddy to do the deal and we didn't need to both be there so I did what I've done dozens of times before and I just send him the $ on an app on the phone.  He hits me up after said things go off without any issues and he's got them waiting.  

&#x200B;

He is then being weird all week and always has an excuse as to why he can't meet up. This dude is like that sometimes and claimed he was busy with work which does happen for him sometimes so I'm annoyed but it's fine. I also stop rationing what I got on me because I know I got 100 waiting for me. 

&#x200B;

This past Friday his phone is off and stays off all weekend. I get nervous something bad happened so I hit up his girl and she tells me that he is fine and they just stayed in all weekend. 

&#x200B;

So now I know that I just got burned by my best friend. I know he made the purchase and I know he got those pills but he is just keeping them.

&#x200B;

I mean getting burned sucks enough and getting burned by your best friend really sucks but the worst thing is thinking you have shit when you don't. Now I'm stuck with whatever stash I have on me right now of maybe 10 pinks. I could have gotten more over the weekend but I didn't because I gave my re-up money to my boy. Now my plug is dry on those so I can't get anymore. 

&#x200B;

The thing I hate the most is the hustle and the constant worrying about running out.   Like even if my buddy didn't steal my shit and I got those 100 I would feel good about it for a few days but after like 3 days I would have been starting to worry about copping more again. 

&#x200B;

It's extra hard cause I kicked dope and now I really don't want anything to do with dope. I don't even like the feeling of dope. It just makes me tired and feel like I'm going to die. I'm hooked on the sorta speedy high of oxy. Oxy gives you that really clean high and it energizes me, makes me wanna talk about be social and do shit. I don't get that from dope. 

&#x200B;

I feel like you can only get your hands on some dope if you need it bad enough. It's not hard to scrape up like 50 bucks and grab yourself a few hits of dope. Plus even if money ain't an issue, there is always a dboy somewhere who is good. By me, especially after recent laws about prescriptions passed, once one of my plugs says he has some it's a race against the clock to get as many as you can before he sells out. 

&#x200B;

Fuck. I never post rants on reddit but this shit warranted it. I don't know what the fuck I can do to feel better about this shit. 

&#x200B;

I got a script for 2mg Subs waiting for me at the pharmacy. I called my doctor this afternoon to ask for some more once I realized my stash was almost gone and I got no way of getting more right now.  Luckily my doctor is cool and he called the script into the pharmacy within like an hour of me leaving a voicemail. Looks like I may be kickin' the OC's because of this so at least I got subs to make that process easier. 

&#x200B;

Hell, maybe I'll get off these things and go clean because of this and then my best friend robbing me will turn into the best thing that happened to me.  Or maybe I'll grab a couple grams of dirty ECP and dig myself into a heavy hole. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. 

&#x200B;

I really wish I liked smoking weed. My life would be so much easier if I could just smoke some pot and be chill. I hate weed though. I don't even drink anymore. Of course the only vice I have is incredibly expensive and difficult to obtain as well as it being dangerous and my tolerance seems to be going up every day. I'm so jealous of my friends who just love smoking weed.

Question is - how would i go about it?

But she can get her adderall (legal speed) and that’s fine because it helps her at work. I just need to vent she wants me to give me up and they make me feel so calm and I don’t want to turn back to dope during times of stress .... I just need a rant what do you guys think ? Should I keep on getting them and keep the whole thing to myself ?  ",1540840541.0

Suboxone is a colder, harder version of the done high but is still very good.

Even prefer them over Hydro because they last SO long and feel like a mood stabilizer that keeps you stable in a uplifted way, not a mediocre ""flat"" like lithium.  Does anyone feel that suboxone/Methadone acts like a mood stabilizer? I'm not bi polar, but I'm diagnosed with ADHD, I do find myself between being happy and depressed, getting angry, pissed off, kicking shit around the house but on either of these I feel stable and nothing can make me sad or angry.

I don't plan on using these long term and only sparingly. For 4 years so I've managed to use Opiates sparingly 3-4 times a month. It is VERY tough and tempting but as I've seen family rip their life apart, lose their jobs over opiates that shit keeps my use in check. When I tried Hydro the first time in my life, I used for a week straight and then abruptly stopped and felt extremely uncomfortable, that was mild withdrawal, I caught myself quick and stayed off Opiates for 6 full months and use very sparingly.

9sftxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9sftxk/just_a_regular_rant_about_the_medical_and/,3,https://redd.it/9sftxk,FeatheredDrake,Just a regular rant about the medical and pharmaceutical system,"My country decided that it's better to limit the access to codeine by making it prescription-only/Rx. I know, I'll probably get shit for this, but I like codeine. It's one of the weakest opiates out there but I don't have access to other sources, therefore I used to get codeine and nod every week or so. It's nothing spectacular, but it made me feel calmer, less anxious and super relaxed.

It's not the first time they do this. A few years ago DXM (cough suppressant with dissociative effects) became prescription-only too. DXM helped me cope with the shit I was going through at that time. I would still go to the pharma occasionally and basically humiliate myself by begging for cough pills. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.

I fucking hate all this hypocrisy. People blame junkies and addicts for doing drugs but they don't think that maybe drugs is the only thing that numbs their pain and makes them feel good. ""Opioid epidemic"" my ass. There's no epidemic, only bad laws. Had they legalized drugs, people wouldn't OD on some shit they bought that was laced with fent. Had they cared about their people, the governments wouldn't punish people by sending them to prisons for drug possession. 

So yeah, you're a ""junkie"" for doing drugs but what else should you do when you basically have to fake your death in front of your doctor in order to get a Rx? Doctors often don't care about you or your pain and they refuse to prescribe you pills (at least that's how things are in my country...if you really want a script, be ready to pretend you're dying, because they don't take you seriously until shit gets out of hand). So you go home and crawl in your bed crippled by anxiety because your psych refused to prescribe you Xanax.  Other people start doing opiates because of pain (physical or emotional) and because doctors wouldn't prescribe them pain medication. I remember reading about Kurt Cobain and how he numbed his stomach pain with heroin because nothing else helped.  Some people turn to hard drugs because of this simple reason: PAIN. I believe that meds and substances generally should be more available.

Yet, they want to take everything from us. Soon enough you won't be able to get any meds anymore unless you have a script. Because of this, an increasing number of people start doing drugs. Because they're in pain, they're not being taken seriously, and there's no alternative for them. Why do I need to humiliate myself for a script? Why not allow people to CHOOSE freely what substances they want to ingest?

So Friday night one of my friends got some ""oxy"" that turned out to be at least fentanyl, actually carfent is more likely since he needed 6 shots of narcan at the hospital to bring him back. 

He got these pills up in Canada that are well known, I used to test the pills he gets with my fent strips but I guess he didn't call me this time because he thought they were real since they were from the same person he usually gets from. 


They were the supedol pills up here in Canada, the 20mg football pills with SS on one side with a V score. 

He snorted a full one and fell out in his car, his girlfriend tried hitting him with narcan and it didn't work so she rushed him to the hospital. He ended up needing 6 shots of narcan to wake him up. The doctors said he was almost certainly going to have some brain damage but fortunately he is doing okay and didn't suffer any brain damage. 

He isn't a heavy user of opiates and only does oxy when he can find it and definitely doesn't do it every single day and has never done heroin or anything like that so he didn't have a big tolerance to opiates. 


Fucking scary shit, stay safe everyone and TEST YOUR PILLS!!!!!! he showed me the pills after he got out of the hospital and they look absolutely identical to the real thing, same weight same shape same lettering which is crazy.

Im not going to read my past posts because it's too painful. As the title states this October marks two years clean. I never thought I would make it, I had gotten to the point in my addiction that I was accepting it was going to kill me. 10 long years. Unfortunately I was traumatized into getting clean, I had someone very close to me OD and pass. But to be honest that probably wouldn't have been enough, the detectives knocking at my door and the threat of 'drug induced homicide' really drove it home. It was a nightmare. The Wd's went by so easily because I was in such grief and fear.  

You guys, can I just tell you the simple pleasure of going to the grocery store, buying ingredients with my own money and making a dinner in my own kitchen. Everytime it just fills me with such happiness. Not everything in my life is great but it is miles better from where I was. I just have to look at my phone to be reminded. Before my pictures consisted of...nothing really. Maybe a pic of the westside to show someone where I was at or a handful of pills. Now it's selfies bc I feel pretty, things I've made, painted and cooked, dinners out with friends and family, my baby nephew. Can I just say how fucking thankful I am that I was clean when he was born. I don't even want to think of what it would be like if I was using. I go on vacations now, I go camping! I've also picked up some intense hobbies I've gotten very good at, mostly miniature making but also painting. I poured myself into it at the beginning to take my mind off things and have made some things I'm really proud of. 

I think that being a junkie has really put some perspective in my life that not a lot of people have. It take A LOT to phase me. Cause really, what could be worse then what I've gone through already. I used to wake up in a groundhogs day nightmare of dope sickness and the struggle every morning. Nothing is worse then that. And I'm just happy to be alive! I don't need lots of money or fancy things, I'm content. I have a decent job, I have my own place, boyfriend and family that loves me. What else do I need? And most amazing of all that 'need' is gone, that fucking hunger that would not shut the fuck up before is just...gone. I forget what it feels like, I don't even care.

I always felt my body super weak, and just didn’t have energy throughout the day. My chest would feel tight and stressed out. Like most people I would just eat junk food, that usually consists of my diet. Pizza and fried foods. To get to the point, I bought a magic bullet and started juicing. It’s hard to eat vegetables when you barely have an appetite for anything else, let alone when they should be raw for optimal nutrition. I started juicing, and since my first juice it’s been like night and day. My body was obviously begging for nutrition, and it was stressed out not having the proper tools to repair itself. Just drinking a juice in the morning filled with raw vegetables takes care of a lot of my nutritional needs for the day, and there’s no chewing involved so it’s not a pain in the ass to do. The boost it gives me actually provides me with euphoria, not feeling like shit and feeling normal is euphoric to me. So here’s what you do. I mostly always use brocali, kale, cucumber and carrots as the main ingredient. Then I add whatever fruit you want. I try to switch it up as much as I can. You can use any frees you like those are just the ones I’m using now, since it’s hard to buy and store a million types of greens. But the more you mix it up and (usually) the nastier the vegetable, the healthier you’ll feel. I’ll take this as many times as I can. My appetite is way up and I can just eat the junk I want now, knowing I got my greens in for the day. Anyways I hope this helps, I feel amazing. ",1540820311.0

I'm ready to be done with this shit (no pun intended...next sentence you'll get it).. I just spent the past 20 minutes crying while pushing an elephant sized turd out of my body. I'm not going to miss that.

I just did a lovely .5 shot. I've got  .1 left and about 30bags to scrape. I'd toss em if I was mentally strong enough but I'm not there yet - plus I'm just as addicted to the process as I am the dope itself. Whether it is setting up a regular shot, preparing cottons, or scraping bags I enjoy my routine, it is momentary peace in the chaos that I've been drowning myself in. There is great satisfaction in getting approximately .2 from scraping bags that just can't be beat - or perhaps the high from that come up is, it remains to be seen. 

I'm late on all my bills - a first for me, I've always made sure bills were taken care of before I'd pick up more, apparently not this go around. Seeing all the late notices is the smack in the face I've been needing, to tell me I can't keep chasing this fleeting high that solves nothing.  She is such a sweet high though, I sure am gonna miss it.

 I've got to remind myself it isnt worth it. It's not worth being broke (woohoo $1.97 in my bank account), the bruises, jabbings & collapsed veins, the opi-rage that is making me snippy at my family for zero reason, the lung cancer that is most likely developing bc menthols are the peanut butter to heroins' jelly, the inability to orgasm even tho dj diddles over here had it down to a science to achieve in under 2 mins - which contributes to my lack of sleep (bc I'll be masterbating for an hour plus before I finally give up bc my hands are tired), the lack of motivation towards seeking a real/fulfilling job/career.  ITS NOT WORTH IT.  It was fun until it wasn't. 

I want me back. I'd like to put the opiate version of me to sleep once and for all. I want to feel emotions again and to learn proper coping skills  and become mentally stronger. I cant keep trying to do everything on my own... I've tried that and look where it has put me. 

The next few days are going to be tough. If any of you have read this far and have some moments to spare the next couple of days please leave comment or even DM me with tips and advice - this little lady is sure going to need it!

What's going on here? It's clearly out of my system 2 days after taking it and I've never done it more than once a week so why over time has my system slowly risen to a point where I need 6x more than I did ten years ago to get a similar buzz?

Am I just more used to it, and want a stronger high each time? Or has my constitution changed so it actually needs more codeine to feel the same thing? And if I totally stop codeine now will I feel any kind of withdrawals or just go on as normal?

I can't work out why codeine works differently from say, paracetamol, in that the same amount doesn't work on the same way each time, despite not taking it all that often.

I already told my intake lady that I want the visitor shot before I step foot outside of their door. I’ve heard that it helps tremendously for craving of alcohol and drugs. I know it’s not a cure all, and cravings will still be present, but does it help any of you a lot with your cravings?

This really has nothing to do with my point though.  


Lately i've been giving my Dboy snacks, for example chips, or i made him some lemonade the other day. Since i only use Friday Saturday and Sunday those are the only days i see him, so i always give him any beer i have left over from night drinking with my lady. He seems really grateful and since i've been doing this the bags have gotten a little fatter, but more important than that he's starting to be really honest with me, for example he tells me exactly where he's at or how long it's going to be, or he'll actually say he's waiting to reup instead of telling me he has it but his car is not starting or whatever stupid dboy lies they come up with to keep us on the hook. 

&#x200B;

Anyway i just wanted to see if anyone else does this, and also to try it if you havent, dealers are just like us and if you're out delivering all day to junkies it might be nice to get a snack or at least have someone show you they appreciate the service you provide.

When I started Suboxone, I was using at least a bundle of heroin per day. I was traveling hours on the subway, back and forth through NYC to cop dope. I sold pretty much everything of value I had. 

I was always behind on rent and on the verge of being evicted. I have a significant other who does not use drugs. Somehow we always found a way to not get evicted. Just typing the word evicted freaks me out. I have nightmares about it. 

I would get a job in retail, work there for a couple months and get fired or quit over something stupid. Wash, rinse, repeat. I was seeing a ‘therapist’ with whom I would cop drugs. I was contemplating using a needle for the first time. I’m glad I didn’t get to using a needle, but it was as bad as you can get without the needle. 

Now, I’m still on Suboxone. I’m also prescribed Klonopin. I started smoking crack while on Suboxone just so I could get High on *something*. I see my doctor every couple months. I’m rx’d 12mg of Suboxone. I fucking hate it and I run out early every month. I’m just as depressed as ever. I sort of put on a mask as being functional to my doctor but I don’t think he buys it. I’m not working and I haven’t had a full time job since March 2017. My partner has worked very hard and has a really good job that can support us both very comfortably. I am so grateful for my partner who has stuck by me since before I started using heroin. 

I don’t regret getting on Suboxone but it didn’t do much for me except allow me to not be sick between when I get money for dope. 

I use at least once every week, maybe every 2 weeks. I smoke crack every time I use heroin. I miss getting high off heroin but now I’m mostly just throwing my money away. I’ll use heroin and Suboxone together. As well as crack/powder cocaine and benzos. Maybe I’m just a crackhead now, I don’t know. 

Suboxone is definitely not the answer to anything. It’s like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound. But I know if I wasn’t on some sort of Opioid replacement therapy I would still be using heroin daily.

Nothing changes if nothing changes, right? 

I don’t really know what the point of this post is. Can anyone relate? I feel stagnant. I can’t summon the will to be sober. I still want to get high. Something sick in my brain thinks I can just get high and have no consequences. I mean I have been very lucky that I haven’t had too many close calls. Knock wood, I haven’t been arrested. I haven’t overdosed. I haven’t been raped or robbed (aside from getting burnt for like $20 here and there). I don’t WANT consequences. 

I just want to want to be sober but I can’t find it inside me. Deep down I know I want to get high. I can’t give up control and go to rehab. I can’t lower my Suboxone dose. I don’t want to lower my klonopin dose although I’ve been forced to. I don’t want to go to therapy. I don’t want to take my psych meds. I want to do what I want to do when I want to do it even though my way has gotten me literally nowhere. Is that the disease talking? Is it a character flaw? I am just tired and sad and anxious and restless and lonely and depressed and apathetic and pathetic.

I guess I should be thankful that they lasted this long as I'm going on 12 years of varying degrees of IV drug abuse. It's a shame I didn't use simple harm reduction techniques more often, because I used to have veins that every junkie dreams about. I could always hit multiple sites the first try without fail, even hitting in the dark if necessary by only using my sense of touch. Those days are forever gone and as such I've been exploring alternative injection sites. 


Not gonna lie the other day I was admiring my white ass junkie thighs in the mirror and noticed that they have a bunch of thick veins that are clearly visible and appear to run near the surface of the skin on the top side of the thigh. Of course I immediately got curious and had to see if they would work for my special purpose. Sure enough I hit on the first try and registered a plume of red that only a virgin vein can produce. Everything went as it should without any surprises. I hesitate however because I've never heard of anybody using this area to inject their drugs. So, I thought I would ask my fellow professional junkies a few questions re: harm reduction before I get too excited... 


Is it even common to have visible veins on your thighs? Does anyone else hit in this area? Are there any additional risks of hitting here? Why haven't I heard of people using this area? 


I know people use the femoral vein - usually as a last resort - and know that there are many risks that go along with that. Of course this is not what I am asking. To me, the upper thigh seems like it wouldn't be much different than hitting in the arm. Am I wrong? Can I get excited that I just found a bunch of new virgen veins to play with?  ",1540704000.0

9s06fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9s06fe/truth_about_oxycodone_in_mexico/,10,https://redd.it/9s06fe,missilesarefun,Truth about Oxycodone in Mexico,"When I was still using pills I would often think of going to Mexico and getting some Percocet or Hydrocodone. I had a plan to go but first I did some researche online and it did not look good, apparenly opioid analgesics were nearly impossible to get even for doctors. And after reading blog after blog I came to the conclusion that there was no Oxycontin or Diladid or anything that was not Tramadol or Tylex (codeine and acetomenophen).

So fast foward to today, I decided to look into the issue again and figure out exactly what the situation in Mexico was in regards to availability of opioid analgesics, prescribing, practises, and available products. 
Well as it turns out narcotic pain pills are available, but the level of red tape and regulatuons are draconian. Ill explain but first here is a list of available narcotic pain medications in Mexico.

Hydromorphone 2mg in 100 ct bottles
Methadone 5, 10, & 40mg 100ct bottles
Oxycodone IR 5, 10, 20, & 40mg 100ct bottles
Percocet 5/325 100ct bottles
Oxycontin 10, 20, & 40mg 30ct boxes
Codeine 30/500 

Thats it, thats all thats available there, but these are rarely prescribed even to terminally ill people due to the oppressive regulation. For a doctor to be able to prescribe these he has to,

1. have a special licence he has to seek himself that is only available in the state capitals of their residing state, and they need to fill out loads of beaurocractic forms (shit) to be able to get it. And the process can take months.

2. They have to get special prescription with barcodes that can only be obtained in the city capital. So the doctor has to drive in person to pick these up in the state capital and can only get so many, so if he runs out he has to drive all the way to the capitol.

3. Only licensed pharmacies can dispense these medications and they also have to go through alot of beaurocratic bullshit to get a license so alot of pharmacies do not even bother and dont carry them.

These are just a few of the hoops physicians in Mexico have to go through so many doctors dont even bother. The problem got so bad that Human Rights Watch did an investigation and found terminally ill patients were dying without proper pain management. Even in the ER morpine was on short supply. And in pharmacies, since very few doctors dont have licenses, scripts are minimal so pharmacies dont have a financial incentive to keep stock and there are routine shortages leaving people to suffer. The drug violence had supred this attitude, but I dont see how making these medications nearly impossible to get helps in any way.

Uncovering this really pissed me off, and I give these mexican politicians a stern 🖕FuckYou🖕 alot of these cunts are corrupt af and they have the nerve to place such restrictions pain medication. And to add insult to injury, politicians and their friends and family have no trouble getting these medications. Now I understand why my 2 of my uncles in Mexico died in pain from lung cancer and why my grandmother cannot get proper pain treatment despite having debilitating arthritis. 

Looking at this I am just thankful I live in the US.

She says it doesn't block anything.  Everyday for almost exactly a month she has been doing 6 good, vinegar smelling,  iced tea lookin'-mixing  stamp bags a day, $30 worth.

Has anyone ever done this?

If she bumps the sub up to 4 mg will she be able to cover the withdrawal?

Or will benzos help more than usual? Ie, she avoids them lately, but i think if she combined with subs, she would see a difference and appreciate them a lot if they have the kind of synergy i used to get. She didn't use them to get on subs time because they didn't help when she cold turkeyed at the last rehab. I know they used to have a great synergy for me but that was for getting high.

I started giving her a tiny piece every day because she was always sick daily, which was me not long ago so i felt bad, and at first it was like it gave her a free pass to use without getting sick, even if she skipped a dose of dope. Now I'm worried since she appears to be getting sick at the 24 hr mark since last dope usage, even though she is taking the sub.

*Tldr*

Using on low dose subs -- can you bump the dose up to a higher,  commonly prescribed dose for a week or so and avoid the sickness?

During one of the surgeries my parents told the docs I used to have a drug problem. They upped the dose to compensate for my pain and were able to keep it under control. They would inject me with 4mg Dilaudid 4 times a day and give me 15mg oxycodones every 4 hours as well. I still have a rod in my leg. 


Now it’s over 2 years later and I still have pain, it is not crazy significant amount but it is still pain. Sometimes I am unable to sleep because of it.

Was in jail for three months and then stayed clean for about a month or so after i got out till i relapsed. At least im working this time instead of stealing from stores. Anyway i just got some h that was ordered from the darknet, according to my friendly neighborhood drug dealer its from the UK.  To my understanding, uk dope is usually in the freebase form, and ideally should be converted to hydrochloride or some other acidic form for best absorption when snorting or shooting, i thankfully stopped shooting but do need to snort it. My acquaintance smokes it out of a bola and said that this batch doesnt smoke as well as the last batch which pulled awesome clouds when i tried it, so he started doing bumps instead. I did a small line, about half the size i normally do and i can definitely feel it a bit but am wondering if i could get some input from people who have dealt with uk h before. Thanks and happy nodz.  

Edit: So i did a bit bigger line, still not as big as normal, but i swear that it tasted like baking soda at first, like it has that basic, non acidic taste. The stuff i usually get smells like straight    
Vinegar with a dash of something sweet or whatever is the cut. I can definitely feel it but its not as gsood of a body high, much more in the head..

i'm a veteran of Gabapentin use and know tolerance builds fast, however I can't seem to pinpoint when that tolerance has been abated. I was taking 1600mg daily up until 4 days ago and have stopped cold turkey. As for Opiates the last time I used anything besides Subuxone was 2 weeks ago. I detoxed down 10,8,6,4,2 MGS in the day following and since then i've been trying to stretch a 4 MG daily dose as many hours as I can.

I ask because I have access to both, right now, fire as fuck but I cannot decide which I like better. I smoke btw. No shooting any more for me.

So far, its like the gunpowder is that reddish brown powder rocks that break down to straight powder we call it "" The Huff"" and then I have the #3 which is like crazy looking hold on peep this.

**The Number 3 (2G maybe like a tad over weight idk didnt weigh it really)**  [https://imgur.com/QJah5Wk](https://imgur.com/QJah5Wk)

  
THe number 3 melts to complete liquid and leaves NOthing behind its crazy ill take pics of trails later but ya whats your opinions what would you buy again more of ? Like should I cop more of the #3 or more of the GP? I know its like #3 is synthd differently so diff alkaloids and I am used to smoking fire gunpowder such as what you see here usually not as good as this current batch because I got a better connect recent hipefully that connect stays around but thats not my point or question my question is which would you want more of?

&#x200B;

Be honest and also how yall doin I have not been on here in a long time 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But yea seriously its like I cannot seem to figure out which is better, I mean I know I am the one with the drugs so I should know but ... idk. Its like the #3 burns completely diff from the gunpowder tar; the gunpowder tar melts to a beautifully clean golden trail and tastes so amazing vinegary and all that smells insane; and shatters to straight powder when needed and is sniffable without water. 

&#x200B;

The #3 though, it like slides super insane fast speeds and then its like it leaves a clearish trail behind like almost no trail and then last night I got so fuckin noddy that I woke up at like 9ish AM in th emiddle of my room on my floor all confused and my head hurt so bad I must've nodded out fell forward off my bed rolled and smacked my forehead off something cuz I got a black and blue huge lump! Shit.

&#x200B;

Oh, I pay like 300 for the 4 grams of that GP and then I paid like 90 bucks for 2 grams of that #3 and the #3 was an import its not from the united states but I sure am. Its the first time I ever got #3 bec in the united states we dont see #3. This came directly from a place right next to afghanistan, no further details can be given and no I cannot help you get it and no I am not your plug or anyones plug I am a fucking heroin addict.

I’m on 8mg daily at the moment and have been taking sublingually for the past few weeks normally

1) if I rail my subutex tomorrow will I actually feel anything different/any high? (Normally I don’t feel any different when taking my 8mg just “normal”)

2) in terms of amount, I’ve read that some people get benefit/feel good after railing 2 or 4mg instead of their normal dose. Is this urban legend or reality (I think due to norbuprenorphine is what I’ve read)

As I’m normally on supervised consumption every day except Sunday I’ve got the opportunity tomorrow to try something different and see what happens but I’m not gonna put my nose through something if there’ll be no benefit. As I say; this isn’t a one off use of subutex I’ve been taking it normally for weeks.

They gave me a reason to live when I started using - I'm not a new user -, and that's how I got hooked. I'm aware addiction brings tolerance, which is an issue, but I can handle it in a few ways.  I know addiction requires money to maintain it, and that's not an issue really. I know the depression and anxiety comes back worse when you go thru wds, but I never go through withdrawals. I'm always mantaining.

You see, one guy on my Facebook killed himself. He just got tired and threw himself in front of a train. Almost everyday on my Facebook feed there are news about him, and what he did - and *why* he did - reminds me of myself. I know how it feels like to be so tired and unwilling to do anything other than lying in bed grieving and lamenting all day. I know how it feels like to feel lost and without any purpose in life. I know how it is to feel so miserable and distressed that you don't just want to kill yourself, you know you will and you'll plan carefully how to do it. I know how it feels like to be desperate 24/7.

I know how it feels like, and it feels hella awful. I don't want to feel like that ever again. I love not feeling that way anymore. It's been so long since the last time I felt that way, thanks to opioids. I don't want to come back to that state of mind ever again. I know that ""that state of mind"" is how I naturally am in my sober state, but I just kept using drugs everyday, every morning, every afternoon, every evening, so I'm under the effects of narcotics all the time - and thus, don't want to die.

And I don't need to get fucked up all day either. Sometimes I take 160mg of oxycodone, sometimes I take 10mg. Obviously 160mg is way better, but 10mg is enough to keep me from wanting to kill myself. So even with all the down sides of addiction, for me it's still way better than being sober. It keeps me alive and functional enough to work. It gives me a reason to live and make money - to do opioids. Whereas before using them I couldn't even get out of bed to do anything and just wished I was dead. Being an addict is better than being dead. At least in my case it was.

I can't recommend using opioids for depression, because that usually doesn't work. But in my case, if I am alive today and have any kind of peace, I own it to narcotics. It will be worse on the long term? I'm already on the long term in a sense! But will it be worse on the even more long term? I don't think it will, but if anything goes wrong, I can always kill myself with a gun or a strong shot of dope. At least in that case I lived years of narcotic peace and contentment before dying.",1540666474.0

I get nausea with other opiates as well, but the combination of Zofran and Bendadryl usually relive it completely. So I don’t know what to do. Do you guys have any suggestions for how to relieve the nausea? Will it start to go away as I do more fent? ",1540653460.0

Just out of curiosity, I decided to check it out. You see, last December I abandoned a car in a business complex’s parking lot. It is a piece of crap. The insurance, inspection and registration were all about to expire, the brakes literally had stopped working (I was driving for a few days with nothing but an e-brake... in nor’easter storm conditions), and then the battery decided to also stop working. Since I had only purchased the car for $300 over a year beforehand, it was time to just let it die as spending even a penny on fixing it would be too much. It’s a really nice neighborhood full of yuppies, so I figured it would last a week at most without getting towed, and basically put it out of my mind. To my surprise, just about ELEVEN MONTHS later and it’s still there. Expired tags and all. Absolutely shocked, I pulled up beside it to see if anything useful was left in there. Oops, I had actually left the doors unlocked. Not much chance of there being a damn thing in there. Regardless, I rifled through the glove compartment, only to find an entire bottle (120 ct) of 8mg dilaudid pills.

&#x200B;

I've been feeling badly for 2+ days. 1 day ago I went to a place that does IV hydration/toradol/zofran that was a nurse practitioner. Spent $200 on it to avoid the ER/Hospital. It helped a little but less than 24hrs hours later I was vomiting at 4am-8am six times. All bile greenish/yellowish and foamy. It really upset my entire stomach. I got to the ER at 9am and wasn't seen till 11am. After that, I was in the ER from 11am - 6pm before being moved up to a room. 

No pain medications. There was a request to have pain management at the hospital see me for non-narcotic management which may or may not involve ketamine, but they didn't see patients past 5pm for that so I was SOL with that.

At this point I've been writhing in pain for days. I tried to go through the appropriate channels and have my nurse call my doctors to prescribe me something just to get through to the morning. None of them would because GI had a massive note in my chart not to give me pain medication.

Like I know pain medication isn't the answer but sitting at a solid 8 of pain for so many hours gets wearing and I finally lost it. I called up my internist and was like, ""what am I supposed to do here?!"" then, my GI called me back because I had left a very exasperated message on his voicemail and was all like ""we don't want to lead you back to drugs."" I was just like again, ""what choice do I have? Will a one time dose really get me back into or onto the drugs?"" He eventually conceded and was all ""fine one dose."" 

& I got it.

Plus, it worked - did it's job. Helped break the pain cycle and I don't think I need anymore of the narcotic. I'm just sick of walking around in a 6 pain score and then being treated badly when i'm in an 8+ because I made the decision to get off the narcotics on my own.

I have been taking 4 oxy 30's daily since I tore my acl in early August. Recently I've switched to about a qtr gram of fentanyl (snorting) which I've done for about 4 to 5 days now. Today I switched back to the percs. I've wasted so much money since the injury that I had to switch to fentanyl at times as its 5x cheaper than blues are.. anyway: I just wanted to get this off my chest and start recovering. My plan was to start taking subs whenever possible and then wean myself off. I only have an 8 mg tablet and an 8mg strip (16 mg total) to complete this task with which I think is more than enough. I also have about 800 mg of tramadol sitting around that I could use as well. My plan was to take tramadol for the first day or two that I dont take fent or perc with, maybe take 2 every 6 hours the first couple days, until I run out of tram, then take the suboxone. My reasoning is that I never can make it through the first 24 hours without getting more percs or fent.. I'm hoping the tram will hold me over through the 24 hours or more that I will need in order to take suboxone. I worry however that the suboxone could send me into precipitated WD when taken AFTER taking the tramadol. Any support or ideas from anyone or information about this would be greatly appreciated. I live with me GF but she isn't a user and she doesnt understand much when it comes to this so I don't feel like I have much backup TBH.. so any support would be very kind and taken affectionately.

so recently, every time i do a shot of tar and crystal i catch myself rotating/gyrating, subconsciously, from the hips on down. if I'm standing i keep catching myself just pivoting my torso left to right, rhythmically, especially while using the phone out doing something similar... but when I'm laying down on my back, i keep catching myself gyrating my hips, and when I'm really flying, i rotate the SHIT out of my ankles.. just little toe circles pivoting at the ankle, both simultaneously. 

i understand the concept of being geeked and fidgeting about (jawing, all that typical geekshit), but this is way more specific, odd, new to me and almost guaranteed by my subconscious if I'm not on my guard.

there's a strange satisfaction in it i can only really compare to pressing ur finger into ur gums in a sore area... the harder muscle contractions of the soleus/gastrocnemius for the ankles and the lower back fibers, guessing lower traps, have begun to yield some weird sensation that my body/mind seeks out pretty much automatically when i combine the two substances. this is after years of this not ever happening.....

i only have one question about it tho... DOES ANYONE ELSE CATCH THEMSELF DOING THIS WHILE HIGH OFF H AND SPEED? im not worried or anything, just can't deny some strange shit is going on w me and its so much more exact than just being methy and hyperactive and tweeky.. 

gonna do a shot of just crystal tomorrow for wake up and see if it still happens, or if it is indeed the combo.. ",1540632553.0

I mean what are the success rates of these places - 1%? 

The only useful thing I've found about rehab is that it prevents me from going out and scoring. But I could a random guy on craigslist $50 to lock me in his basement and get the same result. 

I hate the constant fucking 12 step/AA horseshit shoved down my throat. No offense if 12 steps/AA has helped anyone here - but they seem like a cult or at the very least a very unhealthy community to me. So much of it is pseudo-science, where are the scientific studies proving its efficacy? Oh wait, there aren't any. In fact, there's only studies to the contrary.

Half the retards in rehab think that they have suddenly found the love of their lives in the meth addict chick who they met 7 days before - they hook it up after rehab only to find that she stole your debit card and memorized your pin and down you're $2000 down the hole. 

The boredom - at the rehab I went to only about half of the day (12 hours) was actually structured into going to meetings, or having in house group counseling. The rest of it was spent - staring at walls. Real fucking helpful for an addict going through dopesickness to stare at a fucking white wall for half the day - I'm sure that that's not going to make them start thinking about drugs. 

The stupid ass random rules. One at my rehab was no sugar - soda and candies were banned. Because apparently sugar makes people hyper. Yeah - they actually believed that pseudo-scientific bullshit. That's not all to the pseudo-science - they believed that saunas would release ""toxins"" and help us detox. Meh, OK, lots of people believe in toxins and stuff. But they also asked us on induction if we thought that we had psychic powers - no joke. Also - no electronics - i.e. no laptops or phones or other computer devices, no video game consoles. The only entertainment we had was a TV and a selection of movies pre-screened to not be ""triggering."" I had already watched all of them before the first week was done. 

Smoking was banned, but people smuggled them in. I don't smoke and I hate tobacco but the horribleness of it made me join them in smoking a cigarette. Sometimes it was a quarter cig someone dropped on the sidewalk that we picked up and sneaked away when we were being driven to meetings. 

The holier-than-thou attitudes. People acting like clean time was like what level you were at on an RPG, and higher levels would constantly look down on lower levels as inferior. If you smoked a joint you were suddenly back at zero days - which in that case might as well say fuck it and score some heroin. IMO, weed shouldn't even count as not being sober - in fact weed helps tremendously in helping me stay sober. But to the AA/NA/rehab folks, nope, weed is just another drug and if you smoke it you're risking your ""sobriety.""

Most of the counselors did not even have even a BS in psychology or social work or anything relevant - most of them were former addicts with hardly a high school diploma, most likely working for minimum wage. But boy did they always know more than you!!!

The whole forced interactions. The whole connections to one another - you talk about how you'll keep in touch once you're out and be life-long sober friends - except deep down we all know it's bullshit but we act like it's not. You know that at least 75% of the people there don't even give a shit about their sobriety - they are there to appease their probation officer, or their parents or wife, or some are even doing it to delude themselves - but secretly they are counting down the days until they can get out and score before probably even the first 24 hours are up. And they're jonesing because they know their tolerance have lowered, so they'll be able to get **super fucked up.**

Every day you are supposed to act like this rehab is the best thing ever, that you're having an awesome time, that the people you're meeting are awesome - while in reality you're counting down each day and can't wait until you can leave these obnoxious twats and never thinking about them ever again. 

I'm sorry but before I spend fucking $7,000 to stay in some bullshit ""rehab"" for 30 days - fuck - just lock me up in some room and provide me with food, water, and a bed and I'll pay you $50. 

I don't mean to shit on people who have actually had positive outcomes from rehab - but 99% of people I've met who ""graduate"" rehab seem like they've gotten absolutely nothing out of it except a tolerance break. 

Sorry to be so negative, but there *has* to be a better, more scientific method toward treating addiction. Like imagine if any other disease had a ""treatment"" with only a 1% success rate. The person proposing the treatment would be laughed out of the building.

Currently trying to get clean on my own so sorry if I'm pissy, but getting clean from my own home with no stupid ass restrictions or forced interactions or other bullshit is 100 times better than going to a suck ass rehab. The only thing I wish I had is for someone to lock me up so that I literally couldn't leave. And if I wanted that, I could get it for far cheaper than rehab.

Just felt like ranting - I spent $7K on a 30-day stay at a rehab and honestly I just feel gyped in the end. And this was one of the better rehabs. I can't imagine what the Scientology or super Christian rehabs are like.",1540615282.0

At lunch time, I texted Church Girl and told her that I was home.  Coincidentally, she was home from work also and she asked me to come over because she was down in the dumps too. 

It was a beautiful Autumn day. You know the type - bright sunshine and a little nip in the air. We walked her dogs and came upon a farmers market. We bought fresh fruit and vegetables and cakes. We got back to her apartment and she offered to cook dinner. I said NO. because she was feeling down and I offered to take her out to eat. She picked the place, Roy Roger's, which was  thoughtful of my money. 

We watched TV and she sat next to me and after a while, she snuggled up to me and it felt good and right and so so nice and I knew that she had to be feeling the vibe.  She told me that she ""really, really"" (her words) liked me.  An hour or so later she said that she was sleepy and - here it comes - she asked me if I wanted to stay over and instantly - BOING - little jimmy was standing at attention.  Stay with me now. 

Church Girl went back into her bedroom and bathroom. I knew that girls like to ""freshen up"" beforehand. She came out and gave me a new tooth brush and a towel and wash clothe so I could ""freshen up"" too.  So this is IT, I am thinking, game on! 

And then, SHE STARTS TO MAKE-UP THE COUCH with a sheet and blanket and asked me if I like feather pillows.  NOOOOO NOOOO NOOOO. 

Then she fuc.. I mean tucked me in (her words) with a sweet and delicious FRENCH KISS. And that's it - a super sexy kiss and blue balls like I've never had before.  I left early in the morning and went to work.

Why me? Any other guy would have been balls deep, but not me. What a fucking loser and I am more depressed than ever.

Sorry in advance for rambling, but I'm in a rare good mood and am looking for some of your thoughts on a situation. 

I've been working really hard at a regular, professional job for about six months now. In spite of the fact that I still go do what I have to so that I can get high every single night, the job has actually been going awesome, and I already earned a promotion. 

My boss's boss approached me today about getting me a company phone. He mentioned that a lot of people here get rid of their personal phones out of a lack of need for two (including himself) and that I'm welcome to use the one they give me for both purposes if I feel like it; there's no policy in place about what the phones are and aren't for. 

Obviously it would be great to drop my cell phone bill and my shitty old phone and have some extra cash for dope every month, and I am 100% certain that this is not the kind of company where anyone is making a concerted effort to ""catch"" employees behaving badly....they hired me before my felony arrests were expunged and no one even mentioned it, I've done heroin while driving their company car (so no cameras or anything like that), and they don't drug test at all, like...ever (thank GOD). Basically living the dream here folks.

Still, it gives me pause to consider exposing myself in such a blatant and ongoing way to that much hypothetical risk, especially since I sorta dabble on both ends of the dope game occasionally. Not in a serious way or anything, but like....texts are sent back and forth regularly that would not end well for me if somebody started snooping around. 

TL;DR: On a scale from 1 to 10, approximately howwwww stupid would it be to ditch my personal cell and use a company phone to handle my opiate-related business in addition to my business-related business? Thanks in advance for any thoughts on the matter!",1540597382.0

What are your must-have supplies?,"So I've came across a little money and I'm going to spin this weekend High but tapering a bit and going cold turkey Monday morning. 

I'm going to hit Walmart tonight and get some supplies to make this kick a little easier.

Already have like ibuprofen Imodium a multivitamin Hyland's restless legs all that s***.

What else do you suggest I buy? I know I've done this a billion times but I'm just wondering what you guys suggest.

I'm going to get a big flat of water to try to stay a little bit hydrated some orange juice some popsicles some like Snapple and different drinks Capri Suns s*** that's nice and cold and easy to drink. Maybe some chicken noodle soup something f****** easy to make fresh pack of socks and basketball shorts and s*** maybe a couple extra sheets.

If you we're planning on stalking up what would you get? My brother is going to give me like 20 xanaxs. I'm going to avoid Suboxone I might take a milligram or two if it gets bad enough. Which I'm assuming it will because I'm coming off about 160 mg of Oxymorphone AKA Opana a day which are generally pretty nasty withdrawals.

In my whole life I've never puked during withdrawals no matter how bad they were but there's something in Opana that makes nausea and vomiting nearly guaranteed. I would love to get a hold of some phengren (sp?) but I don't see that happening. Can you suggest anything else to help with the nausea? 
thanks guys wish me luck.

So at the time of this story my grandma worked at a casino. 
My uncle somehow got hired on the construction crew that was doing some work on the casino.

He managed to get a key or code to my grandmas register that had the chips you turn in for money.
Well he started scheming with another construction worker and they worked out a spot on the roof that was right above her register.

They came back in the middle of the night, cut a hole in the roof, and that guy lowered my uncle down with a pulley system they rigged up, like a fucking spy movie or some shit. He then cleaned her register out. 

Well of course grandma was heavily investigated since only her register was emptied and it was obvious that the thief had a key or code or whatever. 

They started looking into the construction workers and knew it was him right away since he was her son and has a shitload of prior robbery/burglary charges. 

Im not sure how much time he got for that but he only seems to do 2-3 years at a time then hes out for a few months before getting busted and doing another 2-3 years lol. 


Another time he had his friend walk into a bowling alley, buy a drink, ""trip"" and spill the drink and ice everywhere. About 10 minutes later he walks in to intentionally slip in the mess and land as hard as he can.

 He was tryng to sue the bowling alley and get a script for the pain but they somehow caught on and he was charged for that as well Lmfao.

So this dope that has been going around is all fent or something, I have seen posts people asking have you blacked out and done some insane shit? And yes, yes I have. This shit takes the withdrawals away but it is almost not even worth it. Sometimes I can do half a bag or 2 bags before I go bat shit insane.


Why can't we fucking get real dope, I have been using for the last 10 years but only Dope the last 3-4 but I have never experienced this insanity. What the FUCK are they putting in this shit. I guess I can say that I am thankful they are because now I don't even want to do it. I don't want to blackout and go insane to maybe feel better. If it was real dope that I could get sure I am all for it. 


Is this Flakka? What is going on? Am I losing my mind? I can get blues all day but they are so pricey that I need like $300s worth to even have fun and that shit goes in 4-5 hours. God damn it I wish this shit was legal so I could work and do it safely. I would be a perfectly functional person in society if I could go to the store and get it. 


Do dope dealers realize that if you are giving us this flakka shit or whatever fent bullshit that we are just going to stop doing? I feel like I am taking crazy pills over here!! Bring back real dope or I am just done with it. Done with it all!


Edit: Forgot to tell you how I got in trouble with the law. I was in a blackout episode apparently screaming like a lunatic in a bathroom and the cops were called on me.

The only people I've felt close to in the last 10 years have moved 1,700 miles away. They don't call as much as they used to. Can't really blame them. When they do call I listen to them talk about their lives. This is a common thread. Selfishness. No one seems to pay me much mind or attention even though I'm always there to lend an ear. No one really seems to care about me, aside from family, and they'll never truly know me or my struggles. I'm starting to get scared that this is going to only get harder as I get older. I don't know where to go to meet people. Most folks don't seem like they have much in common with me. I feel like an alien.

I don't know why I'm posting this. I'm just feeling really lonely and isolated. Thanks for reading.",1540572050.0

9rjxdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9rjxdp/i_wanted_to_get_up_earlier/,7,https://redd.it/9rjxdp,sloan_fitch,I wanted to get up earlier...,"I got up at little before 6am and I wish I got up earlier, I wish it was possible but I didn't fall asleep until after midnight.

Along this phase of my recovery, while living the sub life I started experimenting with waking up early for practical reasons and to combat that bullshit sense of depression I think I have but isn't really that bad at all.

By getting up early I have all this extra time to think, to write, to read, to do whatever I want. On an off day this doesn't seem to matter... on work days it's nice because I have time to do shit before work. I work a lot of afternoons so if I get up in the morning I have like over five hours to myself. if I have work at 9am like today, it's another story. Before I started voluntarily waking up early, I would get up at 7am for a 9am shift. 7am - eat, shower.. wake up best as possible. Then shower and be ready to leave the house no later than 8:30am. This assumes no procrastination or jerking around/writing later than my ""cut-off"" time.

&nbsp;

I hate the cold of the winter, I hate waking up while it's still night out more than waking up early for work in general. Gettimg up early voluntarily on my days off helps to make it easier to wake up early on my normal work days. As I transition, as I potentially taper down my sub dose it'll be ever important I'm armed to cope with cold morning wake up routines. I've chosen that if I am to wake up early, I want to do it on my own terms.

&nbsp;

Although I sometimes have to work 3-10, or 5-11pm... when I have lots of days off in a row, or if I'm getting out of work before 9pm (preferably before 8pm) then I'm pretty much able to wake up early naturally. I started this experiment a little over two weeks ago because I had enough consecutive days off to acclimate and early work shifts scheduled to necessitate being able to wake up early.
Waking up early is kinda interesting. It's nice if you find yourself sitting aroudn at night wanting to sleep but unable to sleep... just wanting to end the day to start a new one already. Well, if you wake up real early such sleep comes naturally.

Logically to me, I wouldn't wake up at 6am if I went to bed at 2am but if I had to be at work every day at 9, I might consider getting my body in tune with sleeping at 10pm. 

&nbsp;

That's all I gotta say about sleep, I figure maybe this'll be of use or maybe not... but I haven't posted a grand post here recently and I wanted to drop in and say something to y'all.


Before I go, I ought to point out that I start my day with 2mg Suboxone and I haven't been re-dosing at all lately. Sometimes when I got up real early or had a long work day I would re-dose to ensure that I wouldn't get ""cold"" or ""the yawns"" towards the end of my shifts and unlikely as it has been proven to be in recent time.

This story has a happy ending after all,"I'm on a solo road trip through the south west, US. I brought some dope with me. When that ran out I cold copped in California with no problem. Got to try BTH for the first time.

I did the last of the Cali black last night so by the time I got to my stop tonight, dope sickness was creepin up fast. It's the final leg of my trip so I just needed a little something to stay good until I get home Saturday. I *thought* I could cold cop here pretty easily too. I've done it in much smaller cities.

I drove around all evening. Looking for an open air market spot or junkies roaming around that could hook me up. It was all off though. I couldnt find anything that looked promising, I felt fucking weird and sick, it just wasnt happening. I got to see the city which was nice but overall, disappointing. Finally at 10:30 pm I said fuck it and went back to my shithole hotel to try to sleep.

I'm wandering down the hall looking for my room when suddenly..dboy rolls up. He asks if I'm looking for something. I guess his dboy senses were tingling or something. I'm an undercover junkie. Anyway, I was fucking elated. I told him I've been looking for him all night. We get to talking and turns out...he only sells clear. He doesnt know anything about black. I'm crushed. It was just cruel. I had my fill of clear in Cali and it wasn't going to help me now. We shot the shit for a bit and then I sulked back to my room.


Of course, I couldnt sleep so a few hours later I go down for a smoke and his homie is outside and asks for a square. I finally find the chance to ask him if he knows where the black is in this God forsaken town. He says, ""Yeah I got you. Let's take a ride."" I didnt get my hopes up yet though. Not again. Apparently, his buddy traps 5 minutes from here. I was kind of expecting some sort of odyssey to make it happen considering how tonight had been going but 20 minutes later I've got my dope and I gave my middle a 20 for his trouble. I love efficiency. 

After all that searching and then a huge let down, it really was right under my nose the whole time! Shot half of it already and feeling fine :) Junkie jesus has been looking out for me through this trip. But tonight was a rollercoaster. Happy nods guys. Stay safe!

From Google I determined that these are extended release and not Instant. I am an absolute newbie and have only tried Codeine before (100mg makes me nod with weed).

I tried 60mg last night but felt almost nothing which I assumed is because it's extended release. Research tells me DHC is about 1.5-2.0x as strong as codeine so i was hoping it would work.

I honestly have no knowledge about these, can anyone offer any advice on what is a good dose or am I fucked since they're extended release?

I tend to get high only once or twice a week. ( I don’t experience WD) . However, the immediate day after i get high is the absolute worst. I think it has something to do with a combination of a lack of sleep and depleting the serotonin so much during your session. In my opinion it’s worse than an alcohol hangover but my brain is sharper than it would be with an alcohol hangover. It’s more in the body; laziness, lack of productivity, depression, I also feel more introverted and want to avoid people. Does anyone else have this issue and does anyone have any solutions? I notice it gets better if I allow myself to sleep it off for the most part 8-10 hours and drink a ton of water. I’m just curious if anyone has any other natural remedies to combat this opiate hangover so I don’t feel like such a shell of a person.

1.) Drinking alcohol 

2.) Getting high again lol",1540507720.0

9rd89n,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9rd89n/methadonefentanyl_overdose/,16,https://redd.it/9rd89n,cactusandroses,Methadone/Fentanyl overdose,"I have zero personal experience with unprescribed drug use, but a young relative recently died from an overdose. The autopsy results say there was methadone and Fentanyl present, but found nothing else. According to the coroner, there was no sign that my relative was a previous heroin user, but friends have given the parents very mixed stories, some saying that heroin was tried once, others say the relative would never, ever have used heroin. But from my research on methadone, it seems like nobody ever just takes methadone for the fun of it, but only to help with withdrawals.

The relative knew and had talked with parents about the dangers of Fentanyl, so it seems strange that they would have *knowingly* taken Fentanyl. But yet why would anyone just take Methadone?

The parents are just so devastated and have no answers and it doesn't appear that any will be coming. I'm hoping that someone(s) here can offer some insight into what MAY have happened, what sounds plausible, or why an informed and knowledgeable person, and from physical appearances and coroner results seems to have been a drug novice, might have somehow taken methadone and Fentanyl mixed.

The seller was a personal friend of the relative, but told police there was no involvement in this case, which is disputed by the significant other. There's nothing clear and there's no real 'evidence'.  There was a roommate present who wasn't told when the relative used the night of the overdose, and the significant other was out-of-town, also another relative lived in the same building, and there was insignificant texting between the two seemingly near the time of the overdose, so the overdose seems to have occurred within planned solitude. This relative appeared to be quite happy; their career of choice was taking off suddenly, and their significant other was about to move in. To everyone outside, their life seemed to be at a peak  (they were early 20s.). Nobody thinks that the overdose was intentional, but of course nobody else can ever know what anybody truly has going on in their internal world.

Nothing makes sense about it, and I don't know if it ever will, but if anyone has any ideas about possible explanations or even just a similar story, I'd be grateful for anything anyone has to share. I wish you all the very best!",1540494196.0

Injecting salt is **very painful** and can be **dangerous**\-- at worst, it can cause cardiac arrest (especially in large doses). It can also cause bad muscle pain, bloody urine, etc.

PLEASE **taste test** first-- if it tastes salty, don't use it! If still uncertain, take a small test shot before proceeding.

The person selling this is not a dealer; however, he is telling folks that the bags are from a dealer in order to appear legitimate. I know at least 5 of our participants have already fallen for it, and while luckily they're okay, injecting salt is serious business so please be on alert if you're in the area.

From where I am at the moment, just getting stable on substitution meds rather than using both methadone and heroin would be step in the right direction.

The reason I ask this question is because I have suffered from depression my whole adult life. I have also, at one time or another over the same period, experienced the whole trifecta of addictions: drugs/alcohol, sex and gambling. I've smoked, popped, sniffed or shot pretty much everything except hallucinogens; I've had compulsive sex with girls after exchanging glances on the night bus home or wandered dreamlike through dimly lit orgies already knowing that whatever is about to happen will be remembered the next day in an absolute swamp of guilt and self-loathing, and while doing research for a magazine article managed to get myself temporarily hooked on slot machines in front of which I'd sit hour after dreary hour until it felt as if my eyeballs were melting and my ears would never stop hearing the dismal ""ding-ding-ding"" of the electronic wheels going round and round.

All of these addictions were a kind of self-medicating, of course. I come from a long line of addicts as well as depressives. My childhood is marked by traumas - physical as well as emotional - and when I've been clean, or even just cleaner, it's been like the whole pot of memories and heartaches has been stirred up so violently it sent things I thought I'd forgotten right back to the surface - hauntings that twist me up and leave me writhing around in a kind of psychoemotional horrorshow.

Recently, though, I signed up with a doctor and started methadone maintenance. I've been using on the side sometimes, but not always. When I don't however, I feel so completely crushed by depression that I seriously begin to question whether I will ever manage to be even remotely clean. I can barely get out of bed - my life is reduced to getting up, going to the doctor, then dragging my arse back home and killing time until I have to do it all over again. It's no kind of existence - I am suicidal, I am full of unshed tears, I am a complete fucking mess.

This isn't who I am - not all of me, and it certainly isn't where I want my life to come to a halt. So what can I do? I was prescribed two types of anti-depressants a few years ago, but neither worked. Does anyone here have experience of this, or anything else that might help me? I'm getting desperate...",1540476900.0

I usually save a rainy day stash for football Sunday’s every now and then (in this case a couple panda 40’s (g series), 8mg dillies, bun of #4).  

Though I was able to bring back some codeine tablets with ibuprofen from some recent travels and wanted to CWE to introduce some pseudo sizzurp into the mix.  I was wondering if anyone has ever used a French press during the CWE process and it so what was your experience?

As speedballs are characterized by the rush of both substances hittjng you at once, a ""real"" speedball would be dabbing some bth (better rush than hcl) and smoking crack at the same time.

So my question is has anyone plugged a speedball? I have a source for some really good #4 and stumbled upon some really great cocaine. As needles are no longer an option for yours truly, I've decided to combine two of my favorite things about drugs: plugging and speedball. Maybe boofball is a better way to put it.

I found it... underwhelming. I did some more coke up the nose and that did half the trick. If you don't know me, my favorite ROA is booty bumping, so I doubt I missed the sweet spot, but I am backed up... So, anyone else try this? Thoughts? Feedback? ",1540457504.0
