I don't have anyone to really vent to right now so I made this account in hopes I could find comfort in this community...

So I relapsed for a bit.  I was hiding it from my SO.  I had plans on getting clean.  ""Just one more bun...I'll get all the proper materials to help get through this withdrawal after this tough weekend at work.  It'll be fine.  No one will find out...""

Well, she caught me.  It's completely breaking my heart seeing her cry.  But, I'm too numb to cry myself.  I am sick to my stomach.  I feel horrible, and I'm definitely not proud.  I completely understand her being mad at me.  I lied.  This wasn't a small secret.  But it is kind of killing me that she can't be more understanding.  It's hard to just turn away forever once this shit comes into your life.  She has no faith in me right now and that hurts.  I didn't relapse to hurt her.  I relapsed in a moment of weakness.  I wanted to escape my life because honestly, I kind of hate it.  I'm depressed.  I'm constantly having anxiety attacks.  But a little dope helps me hide.  I can kick the shit out of the toughest days when I'm high.

She flushed it all down the toilet.  I still have to get through my work week.  I'm gonna have to figure out how I'm going to stand behind a bar for upwards 11 hours, making drinks for a crowd that is gonna be 4 deep basically until close.

Mine would mostly be related on being treated humanely when taking an opiate, more specifically Suboxone. I realized that while i may be dependant on opiates, i am addicted because i am dependant, and i do not have the mindstate of an addict and do not want to classify myself as a drug addict or drug abuser. 


i hated AA and NA for their reasoning to reinforce their opinion of what they think that you should be and how you should act and operate your life. I disdain the government for forcing what we can and cannot put into our bodies . And a few more things that i wont get that deep into at the moment but i hope that you do.

For some reason I expected him to try and convince me to commit to buying dope. I'll still pick up his script as previously promised and he's still going to give me two roxy 15mg's for my effort. + he's willing to trade me a 15mg roxy per a Suboxone strip. Of course, if I can only get the pills... we'll see if he's still interested.


Initially I told him I'd be happy getting nothing from him that day, but if he really needs subs then I'll get him four or five of them in exchange for four or five roxies. I certainly can't expect him to give me cash for subs so better off getting paid in whatever is readily available. If he don't want the subs I'm getting,then I won't accept the roxies he's offering me in trade.


&nbsp;

From there... I thought about buying a drone or telescope but then I had another brainstorm. The original bullshit reason I gave him for not being able to buy dope this week was to have money to pay for a $300 certification. Well, as it turns out.. that certification does indeed cost $300. Might as well get fucking certified. I've been meaning to do that for a while but I just kept postponing it in lieu of pot, and then pills and dope.


&nbsp;


The only thing Cliff said aside from general acknowledgment of my plan to get certified was ""It's gonna be a rough week from Thursday until the following Thursday."" Since I'm not planning to tap his supply of roxies and I'll even help him get some subs as long as he has something of equal value up front, I don't think it'll be a rough week for him.

If he does finish his subs and pills prematurely, it's not my problem. 

&nbsp;

**Funny fact, one which may rightfully get me lambasted:**


In the past when it's Cliff's pay day I've been paid in dope to make an ATM run with *his* card. I never took it upon myself to memorize his card number but of course I memorized his PIN to be able to withdraw money.


On two occasions that were months apart, I had to send Cliff to the ATM with my card on pay day to buy dope. He would take out an agreed upon amount and then I would come through on my lunch break to pick up my dope and partake in ripping a couple of bags.  As a result of those two occasions, **Cliff memorized my card number.** For a while this didn't cause any problems so I left it alone.


&nbsp;

On almost every one of my pay days in recent time however, as I wake up and drink my coffee while waiting for the direct deposit to roll in, Cliff would call the automated bank hotline to check the balance on my card. When the deposit rolled in, Cliff would call or text me to inform me of the amount. From there I would tell him how much dope I plan to buy and then I'd make my way to the ATM to get the cash.


It felt a little creepy that Cliff was checking my balance for me but it was convenient.

&nbsp;

THEN, on a couple of more recent occasions Cliff would ask me if he could order food on my card and would offer to pay me back in pills. When he still had pills during my pay day, this was not a problem. Of course if I said ""you can spend $30"" he'd spend $32. Then another time he said ""If I spend more than 30 this time, I'll give yo a fourth pill."" Well of course that time he spent $42 though I guess I can't be a stickler since my $4 breakfast sandwich was part of that order and he still gave me  a 4th pill, a $40 value after paying for his $38 in food.


**Nonetheless**, it creeps me out that he can and does check my card balance. Especially in the middle of a pay cycle. There was one time he ordered food and I didn't even know until two days later. I had to review my account history to pin-point it. When I texted him about it he said, ""yeah, you said it was okay."" Which I most certainly did not since it was $30 out of my last $50. He of course did pay me back in pills a week later but that doesn't replenish my cold hard cash for the preceding week. 

&nbsp;

More recently, I got a second debit card. Upon getting paid, I transfer a lion's share of my money to that card. So if Cliff asks me if he can order food, I can say no without being guilted for contributing to his mom's starvation.

A couple of weeks ago he caught a glimpse of my new debit card while I was racking up a line of dope and said ""do I need to memorize a new card number?"". Motherfucker, no! Well, that's what I said in my mind. Verbally, I told him it was an invalid prepaid card or some bullshit. Since then I've made sure not to let that card see the light of day in Cliff's house.

&nbsp;


Of course I can lock him out of my direct deposit card by changing the pin or eliminating that card but then if I need him to run to the ATM in the future on my behalf, he would get the chance to memorize my new card. So for just a little longer I'll pretend all is hunky-dory but obviously if I continue not to buy dope on pay day with Cliff as I am planning this week, that card will go the way of the Dodo. 

&nbsp;

In the mean time, I'll get paid, then I'll immediately transfer money to the card number he doesn't know so that when he checks my balance, he'll get the perception that I can't loan him any money for food because I'm broke. All the while the money that I plan to spend on tech certifications, a drone or a telescope will be safely stored on in an account that he cannot see or touch.

&nbsp;

 
#Phase 1
**Stop spending money on pay day to buy dope with Cliff.** If I was to spend money on dope this pay day and let Cliff middle for me, I'd have to buy dope for him and myself. So if I wanted two buns, I'd only get one bun for my own consumption. If I wanted Four buns, I'd have to buy five buns because there's a discount and then I'd still have to share half my order with him.

Sure, he'd pay me back for the part of the order that I got for him but he would not give me cold hard cash. He would likely give me some pills and some dope a week later. No, thank you.

&nbsp;

I'm excited about phase one. Now that I have that in the clear, I have one more option in addition to tech certification, a drone or a telescope. 


I can buy myself dope with my friend Tim (not to be mistaken with Tom). Tim will not scam or rob me. Furthermore, if I buy dope with Tim, I don't have to loan him half of whatever I buy. I could literally buy myself a small amount of dope and then still have money left over for a drone, a telescope or a certification. Whereas, if I bought dope with Cliff, I could not do any of these things.


Not the best idea, but I have it in the back of my head so that I **do not** get the temptation to buy dope with Cliff at all on pay day.",1520313403.0

First I was in like Afghanistan or something, trapsing thru the desert and came across this town where all the kids had no arms or legs, turned out there was no food and the adults were eating these kids arms and legs to sustain themselves. Still tried to score there, eventually got my hands on some dodgy looking shit then I woke up (typical). 

The next part of my dream, somehow I'd made it back to UK and I was with my middle at some council estate. Kano (the grime MC) was there doing heaps of meth and trying to hit me with a steel pipe for some reason. Anyway, again I eventually got on and tried to catch a cab from UK to USA before my parents noticed I was gone. I woke up really confused thinking I had stashed a wine glass that I was using to smoke gear beside the bed. It was really disorientating.

I really hate doctors. Especially my last two experiences.
Needless to say, i am prescribed Suboxone and have a very substantial stash of codeine

Phase 1 of my plan was to detox suboxone down to 1/16 of a 2mg tablet,
Then transition to very lose Codeine or Dihydrocodeine 
Until my pain levels out
At which point i would continue using Codeine and Dihydrocodeine for pain relief and Buprenorphine itself in a mega-low doseage (i.e. 0.2 mcg or 0.4 mcg )

and transitioning back and forth honestly in seek of effect of pain relief.

If i can get my Suboxone down to a low enough amount, quit, use a different opiate for pain,
Then if i absolutely need it, use Suboxone again, it would most likely obtain its pain killing effects rather than just other effects that do not manage my pain. most likely due to being on buprenorphine specifically for over 10 years straight

I just wanted to update my situation for anyone who may have caught some of my desperate pleas for advice on here. Anyway, I‚Äôve been ‚Äútrying‚Äù to get clean for the past 5ish months, but I‚Äôve also been chipping here and there whenever I‚Äôve been able to get away with it. Well, that time has come to an end as I must begin Outpatient services at the beginning of next week. So, obviously I have been full on obsessed with having ‚Äúone last hurrah‚Äù with my frienemy, lady dope. Here‚Äôs where things get hella complicated...

I live an hour (approximately 50 miles) away from the nearest big city, which is where my 2 d-boys reside. (Yes, I only have 2. I‚Äôm a loser, I know. Ha ha ha.) It‚Äôs always been a pain in the ass, but I haven‚Äôt had access to a vehicle for several months. Thus, living in the country and working in a small city (which is still an hour away from the big city, and doesn‚Äôt have any public transportation to take you that far) has made copping damn near impossible. 

Now, over the past few months I‚Äôve had some ‚Äúluck‚Äù with either, paying a shit-ton of money for a taxi (which was $200 ONE WAY), randomly getting hooked up with the ONE Uber/Lyft in town (which is magical as it‚Äôs frequently nowhere to be found), borrowing a co-workers car (which I had to be stupid discrete about), and my d-boy actually let me send an Uber to bring him to me and take him back home a handful of times (which he has adamantly refused to do any longer.... I honestly don‚Äôt think he would do it if I offered him like $400 for one fucking bundle at this point... craziness, right?).

Anyway, all of these routes have been straight up dead ends for the past week that I‚Äôve been trying. Which makes total sense considering this was my last chance to use for quite awhile (hopefully forever, honestly), so why would things work out in my favor, ya know? After these all fell through, I actually tried several other different ways to get something, ANYTHING to work. I won‚Äôt go too far into details about those other plans though for certain, needed   reasons. LOL. Of course those were all dead ends too anyway. Of. Fucking. Course. 

But, FINALLY, today my junkie ass was smiled upon. I got out of work hella early, and there was an Uber 10 minutes from me willing to drive me into the city, and my d-boy was actually good and ready for me!!!  (The last time had a ride set up to take me to the smaller city I work in and then an Uber AND Lyft both magically driving around said town, my dude told me to come through but 15 minutes later said to ‚ÄúHold up, bro.‚Äù because he didn‚Äôt have any fucking dope and wasn‚Äôt gonna get more until later that evening, when I no longer had a ride into the smaller city!!!)

So. Ya‚Äôll. I finally got my ‚Äúone last hurrah‚Äù!!! (Of course as we‚Äôre walking around shady back alleys in a rather hot area of the city, my d-boy takes my money for a brick, hands me 3 bundles and says ‚ÄúI got 2 for ya the next time you come though.‚Äù What. The. Actual. Fuck. Whatever, it is what it is.)

Anyway, I‚Äôm currently happy and high and chillin‚Äô like a villain. I just wanted to say, THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who took time out to analyze my situation and give me a bunch of terrific advice and ideas. AND to those of you who simply sympathized with me and gave me many beautiful words of encouragement. There truly are a shit-ton of awesome, amazing, smart, sweet peeps in here. And I have SO much love for yinz wonderful people. 

Thanks again, ya‚Äôll! Stay safe out there. Much love to you guys!

Finally got 18 months and had a job paying 600 a week before tax.  Thats not much but its something i never had and I was very proud and finally financially stable... two months ago they let me go.  For the first time in my life it wasnt my fault, they gave me a severance package and all those that mattered promised to be strong references... still hurt like hell though.

I applied lots and within a month got a second interview and I did splendidly.  They made a formal offer for more hourly than I have ever made, health insurance, 401k, and lots of room to grow. This was it, I finally had a chance at a career.  I waited to be scheduled for training, did the urinalysis, and fingerprinting.  The only thing on my background is an OWI 9 years ago and they knew about it.  They said it would not be an issue - misdemeanor, old, and no jail time.  Except there was... a little... jail time, that is.  I popped a roxy and failed a urine screen way back then, it wasnt even a habit to use on probation but all the same, I was caught.  I did seven days for that.

What I didnt know was that it mattered.  What i didnt know was that counted.  I was called today and thought I was going to get scheduled for training.  Instead they said my offer was no longer valid, the jobs gone.

For example, hydrocodone and oxycodone do *almost nothing* for me. I feel a little bit of a head rush, they work as actual painkillers and everything, but overall I wouldn't say I feel ""high"" or even euphoric. On top of that, they both cause horrible constipation for me, so I avoid them unless I need them for a medical reason.


I thought this was weird because from what I've heard online, these are both supposed to be great highs, yet I get almost nothing out of them.


On the other hand, I've had Codeine, just 30mg tabs, and I **loved it**. Super tingly, and euphoric, even just talking to other people gave me this wave of pleasure. In fact, I'd probably say Codeine would be my drug of choice, if I could get my hands on more.


Compared to hydros and oxy, it was night and day. Even a couple grams of Kratom gives me much more effects than ""stronger"" opioids. 


To be honest, I'd trade oxycodone or hydrocodone for Codeine or even Kratom any day of the week. Which isn't an opinion I've seen *anywhere* online. 


I still have yet to try Morphine, which I think I might like, because Codeine is mainly just a morphine prodrug, but I have trouble wrapping my mind around not liking oxy for example, because it's supposed to be stronger than morphine.


My question is, has anyone heard of/had similar experiences? Also, is there a biological reason I might not be receptive to certain opiates? Thanks :)

A suggestion....not exactly what you think!,"So after talking to someone about NA, etc. I thought of something, why not form our own group, called OA, based online? We basically follow the 12 steps, but we don't take that hardline approach that can scare addicts.


I guess the difference is, I think we as a community, could help each other out, those who want to stay clean, or those who just want to stay alive. This isn't a sobreity only group. 

This is a quality of life group. I want to improve our quality of life, individually. If you use opiates, we should help you with HR, not turn you away or chastise you. 

You'll quit when your ready, and when that time comes, we will be there, but we don't want to be pushy. The main rules of the sub will be followed, i.e. no sourcing etc, the crap that comes with operating a private chat.


I feel that NA can be a little harsh and scare others away. My intent, is this is a bridge, or so, to ease people who may not be comfortable with NA, to give it a shot.


Honestly, I thought NA was bullshit, but I gave it a shot this last month, and earnest shot. I don't really believe it all, and I still find crap in it I don't agree with, but I can't deny it. 


Something positive is happening in my life. Is this a good idea? I was thinking something alongs the line of a chatroom like r/trees has. Maybe this breaks a rule on here, but I looked and nothing suggests this.

Thoughts? Suggestions? Insults?


**TLDR: I want to make an all-inclusive group, of users and those who are clean or trying to get clean from opiates. Even if you have no urge to ever get clean, you can join. That's the premise. Yes kinda like this sub, but more....focused on taking active steps in HR**


 Because this group is about harm reduction and improving quality of life (and maybe segwaying into NA, but we don't want to push their doctrine). No coins/tags, no counting days, the only thing we care about is ""how is your day, are you okay, safe? If not lets talk about it, I think a lot of us have had really shit days, and can help someone else get through it.  

Like say you're having a problem shooting up correctly, this is a place you can come for advice with no judgement. And if you want to get clean, we should be there for each other too. I know people who are using, find hope sometimes when they hear others getting clean, and it may effect them down the road.

I just feel, NA is lacking something, whatever that thing was, it kept me away from attempting to reach out to people who were willing to help.


Any of the mods want to weigh in?

I am interested to know what your withdrawl symptoms are, some experience all and some experience unique and also just certian symptoms but harsher.

I have never ever been sick when in withdrawls, when most say that is the most common, my most common symptom in severe goosebumps and no appetite.
The sleep and wake in 1 hour soaked is horrific that is my worst symptom by a million miles.

Tonight I have managed to feel 70% better and eat a bag of Haribo, 1/4 cheesecake some McDonald's fries and some noodles.

Do you think I could awake tomorrow with no appetite again and restart the process? Or do you believe when a symptom improves it improves for the duration of the withdrawl?

I know I am waffling, I am just trying to understand the chemistry and the kindling effect of these withdrawls, it's such a unique and horrific experience, the worst flu you could get is alot better than this, due to the none mental aspect that lingers.

I have been snorting .5mg or suboxone every few hours to take the edge and this is day 3 of my detox.

I have 3mg of suboxone left now, do i even need to 're dose to try sleep if I am not in need? Or should I save it for tomorrow, or maybe just use like .25 mg before bed now?

I'm u.k hence why I'm going to bed now lol!!

(communicate my intent not to buy dope with Cliff on pay day),"#Note: Scroll down to the long horizontal line and bold text that says ""Start here"" if you don't want to read a whole bunch of background info to build up to the point of this post.

&nbsp;

Last two times I was at Cliff's house were a couple of days ago. The first was to watch SVU and Waco and that did generate my previous and most recent Cliffpost. Secondly was to help him buy subs. For once he actually wanted to buy subs in a timely manner but his sub connects suck or barely exist so of course I was requested to accomplish this mission through my contacts.


&nbsp;

My contact was originally going to come to me but due to rain and hunger they opted to go to the local fast food joint. It was pouring rain outside so the connect offered me one extra sub for biking over. Cliff paid for four subs and agreed to give me one. Of course I didn't tell him about the fifth free sub so I pocketed that as well. All-in-all, I did pretty well for myself.

&nbsp;

That night stuck around after delivery I stuck around Cliff's for all of thirty minutes. During that time we glossed over a couple of topics. For one, he shared a story about his attempted trade/transaction with our neighbors. One of them being the hardcore benzo enthusiast who wanted to trade three blues for many xannies. Cliff didn't want to trade, he proffered cash to buy a bundle of dope. The benzo enthusiast wanted $25 when he paid $20 and he felt that he deserved to make a little money off of each. With Cliff, he wanted two for $5 on the benzos when fair market value could easily reel in more cash per pill. 


Moff, the benzo enthusiast argued that Cliff didn't pay a lot for the benzos so he shouldn't charge as much. Okay fair enough, Moff always wants top dollar for shit but always wants to low ball. Just about every selfish actor in trade.

&nbsp;

Tom, not to be mistaken with Tim lives nearby as well and is often the middleman for Cliff. Tom is the one who ratted me out indirectly for doing dope. The true details are murky and will never be fully known but when I was told that my brother was coming over to ""talk about something very important"" on a particular Saturday, I had a hunch what it was about. Once I had a hunch on what it was about, it wasn't very hard to guess the source of the leak.


Months later, Tom apologized to me for being the source of the leak. He said, ""I was talking to my mom and my brother must've overheard...""


WTF, why the fuck does he think it's cool to talk about my dope habit and my need to purchase suboxone before a trip with his mom. He probably told his brother directly, but if he did only tell his mom.. she has a big mouth as well so I'm lucky the info didn't spread with more virility. In conclusion, I believe Tom spoke about my activities in order to soften the negative impact of his mother knowing about his own activity. ""Look, Sloany does this shit too and he's a bright fella."" After the fact I told this mofo, like WTF... I don't tell my family that you do dope and smoke crack. As far as they're concerned you're a professional in whatever you do. Well, in reality I used to say that. I stopped covering and started slandering his good name in front of my immediate family after the information leak as part of my damage control.


&nbsp;

After the info leak, my brother came over to have the talk and stage the intervention. The first question aside from how I was doing, of course it was the master inquiry. Am I doing dope? Where the fuck did you hear that from? Around the neighborhood you say? 


I love when someone rats you out or accuses you of something and nobody will tell you who. Like when I was kid in school and someone ratted me out for throwing food across the cafeteria or some other shit. Later on in life when I hear the saying, ""you have the right to face your accuser"", I think back to all the times I could've quoted that phrase when I was kid. Of course, the schools are like mini dictatorships. As for family interaction, I don't know why I can't be told who the fuck the source of the information leak is. Perhaps this is to make it more challenging for me to cover my tracks? It's not like I'm going to go beat the shit out of a friend who contacted my brother out of concern for my well being. 


&nbsp;


So anyway, a few months ago we have this talk in the family room due to an information leak. Aside from asking whether I was doing dope, my sibling also said, ""I was told that you tried to sneak Suboxone on to an airplane."" I truthfully stated, I did not *try* to sneak Suboxone on to a plane. I also attested to the fact that I went through a full body scan and physical frisking. Since I had a hunch of who made the information leak, I made up a story about a weed transaction gone awry and spoke about how Tom is in fact a crackhead. Crack is the worst (exaggeration) and people who do crack and heroin are even worse. **Would you trust the word of a crackhead-heroin addict?** Apologies to anybody who likes Crack and Dope who is reading, but this did prove effective as a means to draw suspicion away from myself.


In the end of that discussion, my brother was sufficiently satisfied as was my father after a urine test. Yes, many of us know that urine tests can be thrown and this proved effective in this instance.


&nbsp;

#Start here if you don't care for the background info:

**During that intervention, before I sufficiently convinced the inquisition that I was not consuming dope, my brother stated, ""so, there is a detox period."" To which I responding, ""which is entirely unnecessary since I have nothing to detox from!""**


Fast forward to two days ago, I'm sitting at Cliff's kitchen table as he's prepping himself a line. I took a portion of a sub that day as I did for the days prior, the topic of cessation came up. I referenced the time I had that mini-intervention and how my brother referenced the ""detox period."" Cliff made light of addiction by saying that I needed detox as much as he didn't need Jenny Craig (he's a fat bastard). He argued that I by no means needed to detox, supposing that I wouldn't go through too much Withdrawal, if any whenever I stopped using dope.

&nbsp;

I felt like I was being told the sky is not blue. I know that I can at least experience withdrawal symptoms that last a solid three days. After the worst of it things smooth out but it still isn't the easiest week. This is why it's easy for someone to be drawn back to using dope once they have the means to get dope after seven days of nothing. If I wasn't addicted, I wouldn't be going out of my way to get Suboxone before getting dope-sick. 


It's like he sees the writing on the wall, that I'm not super committed to spending a bunch of money on dope this coming pay day. I've hinted many ways by indicating that there is no certainty that I'll buy dope this coming pay day. I still told him regardless of what I do, I'll still pick up his roxy script this week if time permits.",1520283089.0

(And monkeys too, lets be real now)... 30+ days clean update","Hey mans and womans, I'm just updating from the other day after my cotton ""episode"", whether or not that counts as a relapse I think is up to you, but for me personally, no. Since I didn't shoot it, or go out and buy dope.


Shit's been rather good since I got clean, almost shocked at how fast my life has turned around in a month. After getting laid off, I now make far more money then I ever did at that job, and it's all tax free (but legit, I'm supposed to pay taxes eventually). 


No I am not a stripper. My dick is too small, and my tits are too big.


But on that same note, I've lost over 15 pound in the last month, about 30 over 4 months. I always, lose weight when I get off dope, and always balloon when I get on it.


That being also said, hopefully my body will be beach sexy in a month (or at least above ground pool sexy). Since I'm going to [redacted] country on a vacation, to which I actually am able to pay for (holy fuck). I learned that prositution is basically legal, I never knew how many countries either had it legal, or didn't care, in the Americas (and well pretty much everywhere, IDK how I fell into this prostitution rabbit hole, I liteerally have more interest in the law aspect of it, then actually....you know,  hoho! (oh... see what I did there?)


No that isn't my primary reason to go there, I wanted to see monkeys, that was my reasoning. Then I learned this after the fact....hey quit looking at me like that. I was absolutly not planning on having sex with the monkeys. Dammit, I should just stop tying, o well too late. backspace is broken because I said it is.

I never thought in my life i'd be able to afford another trip. But hotel's been paid for, visa is in order, tickets almost bought. So expect some cool pics around my 60 day update!


If anyone can guess the country, I throw like 5 dollar btc your way for lulz, just felt like making it entertaining around here for you guys, since when has there been any kind of contest or fun here?


>BUT LANA, THIS IS R/OPIATES, THERE IS ZERO FUN HERE ALLOWED!


As you can tell, I'm really bored this morning, I hope you guys are doing good. To those trying the lame, sober road like me, keep on trucking. To those taking the cool, fun road, be safe bruh, do a shot for me, but don't go overboard!


edit: Rules:

1 guess per person, don't be a dick and make multiple accounts. It's just for fun, and only 5 bucks, come on don't be a dick.

194 chances! gogogo


**rule addenmun edit:**

So to put a sense of urgency, and add more fun, I decided to put a dead line, let's say exactly 1pm, eastern standard time, you win! I had in my head 3 countries I'd go to (in case no one guessed it, maybe should have mentioned that, but o well lol) New Zealand.  So someone is going to win, or I can send you fent test kits, I got a pack of 10 coming, I will send 5 or 5 dollars 

hell I may do 2 prizes, not sure yet, depends if the strips come in, I aint rich! one 5 dollar, one 5 pack of fent strips in bit coin, your choice if you win, runner up gets the other (fent strips havn't got here yet, so if they do not come in a reasonable amount of time, should be today, $5 with default, offer valid in 194 counties, not valid in DPRK, unless you got monies.)


Also, if no one get it by midnight tonight, eastern time, you can guess again before 1PM. :) Why am I doing this?! I'm just fucking bonkers today, this is cool by the mods right?


if this works out, I'll do more fent strip give aways and btc give away in the future (nothing insane, like no more then 5 dollars, or I may just order a ton of fent strips and do that).  The fent epidemic is something I'm completely unfamiliar about, we don't really see fent down here, but I've met people personally effected by it. So it scares the shizzle outta me. I think one of the steps is servicework? Consider this kinda that?


**CONTEST OVER, WE HAVE A WEINER**: u/achemicaIreaction claim yo prize foo! Stand by u/drugstorecowbro for a second prize in time, or if he doesn't give me a response in a day. I'll be staying a block away from Trumps Silver Weiner overlooking the Pacific!


really the point of this, I just wanted to share some positivity that's been going on in my life, with you guys. hope you had a larf! I think I will post this once a week, after Last Week Tonight airs on the east coast! So check back then, hopefully I'll be able to get more fent kits, and make this something cool, really this was just kinda testing the waters!",1520258380.0
825zeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/825zeh/recently_tried_plugging_hydromorphone/,5,https://redd.it/825zeh,FirstEverAlt,Recently tried plugging hydromorphone,"And I loved it! 

When it's up to me, I'll always grab hydromorph contins - the big capsules full of tiny beads - and crush and snort them. I'm not a needle person, so the intranasal way has always worked fine for me. However, I recently got my hands on some low mg hydromorphone pills (I guess they're dilaudid), 4 and 5mgs. 

The first time I had them a couple of months ago, I tried to snort one but it's just too much powder compared to the little crushed beads I'm used to. So I ended up just eating most of them (not all at once lol, just over the course of the week or whatever), and like, it sort of worked, but I was munching them every couple of hours and was just sort of ""well"" as opposed to high. 

Anyways, so this time I got the 4mg dilaudid again, and both yesterday and today I plugged 3 of them when I got up. This morning I plugged the 3 and then was able to lie on my bed for 10 or so minutes while I waited, and I actually felt that wonderful, warm opiate come-up buzz! I used to get that nice come-up feeling when taking percocets when I was younger, and that feeling is probably what attracted me to opiates in the first place. I didn't even think I could get that feeling anymore, so it was quite a pleasant surprise! 

Anyways, I made an alt account just to share this because I had to tell someone. So if anyone out there is considering plugging but is feeling deterred by the idea of putting something in your butt, I'm just here to vouch for it. I'm feeling *quite* nice and high now, and it's been about an hour and a half since I dosed.

A good, ""trusted"" dealer gave them to me (market price too) giving me the story they came from a friend who had a pharmacy connection.  He's been a great dealer for about bhalf a year now, btw.  But with Percs.  His source dried up (thanks Sessions) and this new contact came in.  He reassured me 100% trustable.  But you know how that is.

Anyway, I didn't have strips to test, so sampled a half of a quarter of a 30 mg pill (like 4 mgs).  It hit almost immediately, but didn't have any euphoric effect.  Still felt something lacking in my gut.  But did something, felt intense...but like a downer with intent.  Every fiber of me felt it.  It stopped the cravings in my gut for an hour or two.  I have no idea how to describe it other than it temp. shut down dope cravings and sort of felt good for an hour?  Then felt ""heavy"" and non-euphoric but was doing something and that lasted another few to four hours.

So the next day I did a quarter (7 to 8 mgs).  Same but more intense.  At this point I thought it was all in my head since I was used to Percosets and Morphine.  Maybe it was a brand switch?  But Oxys are supposed to be amazing, and they are dereived from same dope. Right?

Next day I did half a 30mg pill.  All day (7 hrs), I had the feeling I was still going through withdrawls from my previous Persoset supply being cut short (tapered off to 7 mgs a day though) and thought the Roxys would totally help, but they weren't, but I was feeling super intense and focused, but off at the same time. Which sucked as I was in an important biz mtg.  I tried to sleep as I felt insanely tired, but could not slow myself down for a nap.  Weird.

So the withdrawls continued to claw at my gut today, but I felt this heavy feeling again when I took a quarter of the A-215s.  So I texted my friend to see what was up with him.  My friend who went in on the buy says the same.  We both do believe they aren't Roxys.  We met tonight and discussed it for a few hours and we think it's not just in our heads.  But damn they seem/look legit, and this dealer is too.  If not Fent, what other crap can they be pressed with?  What have we been taking?  Hopefully not Fent + benzos + Adderall or something.  All hard to get off of.  But hey, look where I'm posting.

They look perfect.  Good speckling, cut in half...the right color inside.  They taste bitter when you lick them (but not overwhelming).

They only strange thing is when you cut them with a knife, they are rock hard.  Seems weird. Takes some muscle to cut them into fourths.  Is that normal?  Part of me thinks we found someone really good at the pill press with Adderal mixed with Xanax or baby power or something with a dash of Fent. 

Testing a pill for Fent tomorrow (my friend is picking up strips).  Fuck this.  The whole three days I've been in withdrawls despite.  Only tonight took 7mgs of Morphine and SUDDENLY felt relief.  Roxys these are not.
