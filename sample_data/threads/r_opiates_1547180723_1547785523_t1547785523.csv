I have a weekend pass and I really am looking forward to getting dope and coke and just speedballing all day long and through the night.

I had 4 months clean before this and i relapsed cause of some pussy and multiple other things. Had a great support group and friends where I lived. I loved it where I was at I really felt like I was at home. 

My boss moved me out to daytona after my relapse and I live on the worst street here in town. Its ugly, grimy and riddled with homeless and drug dealers. DISGUSTING. This halfway house isnt bad but I'm definitely not using here the dope out here is all fent and I'll die.

Idk really what I'm going on about but I have 17 days clean and all I want to do is get high. I dont have any friends out here and it's hard to keep in touch with friends that are an hour or so away. I just wanted to vent but I'm pretty damn set on getting high af saturday. 

If you are getting into opiates for the first time. Please whatever you do stop if you can. I've been hopping from halfway to halfway almost died 5 times. A cycle I'm DETERMINED to break. 1 overdose had me in the hospital for 3 months and took me 10 months to learn how to walk. And 1 month to learn how to properly use my throat muscles.

 The last one I was in a coma for a week and had to relearn how to walk which took 3 days. Same thing with my throat. Speaking was very hard and took alot of effort. I just wish I could change it all but that's me. I'm a fuckin fighter and had tons of people die around me when it should've been me.

It will take me one day if I dont stop for sure but for now I'll keep fighting. I hope I have a change of mind once I get out there tbh but I doubt it once I got that cash in hand it's no turning back.

I have no idea why, but it got to the point where I had to cut back down slowly which never happened to me before. Eventually even 10mg started making me sick. I would almost always throw up.

It's a husband and wife from Honduras, that's why I say ""they"". I'm going to give you all a little timeline so you can understand my frustration a little more. 

The first 6-8 months they didn't have a vehicle so when I'd call to meet they'd have me go to their apartment building and they'd be out within 5 minutes of me arriving every time, majority of that time they'd be waiting for me outside cause they knew it only took me 8 minutes to drive there. They would give me 2 free b's almost every single day just because I would spend a minimum of $60 a day, a lot of times I was spending over $150 a day because I would get white as well. I would also get a free one every $100 I spent on top of the 2 free ones. It was great. They also would need a ride a couple times a week and it's always be to the same place 15 minutes away, and they would give me 2&2 ($40 worth of shit) for the ride. 

After that 6-8 months they finally got a vehicle. They'd give me a meeting spot and sometimes they would wait for me to arrive or I'd wait for them to arrive, it was never a long wait. They cut back on the free ones they would give me just because. They always would do a free one every $100 spent, but they stopped giving me 2 free ones every day, but would still do it once or twice a week. It was still awesome. I expected no freebies because they would be having more expenses because of their vehicle. This went on until about October of 2018. During that year and a half I probably was fronted $80 worth of shit a couple times a month. I got my first front after going through them for several months and because I always paid them back when I said they did it whenever I needed it. Then in October they said they could only front me 1&1 at a time, even though I never was late on a payment, but I said okay because it was better than nothing on the days I needed the help. They also stopped giving out free ones at that time too, other than the one every $100. I was bummed but it was whatever. Then out of nowhere yesterday I asked them for a 1&1 front for the first time in a month and they said no because they do not trust anyone anymore so no credits.. I was confused cause I always paid when I said I would, so I mentioned that to them and they responded with ""I cannot see you anymore because you ask again when I said no more"" so I said ""I only asked why because I always pay"" and they said ""It does not matter I do not do credit anymore"" so I just spent last night sick, got my paycheck today and hit them up and it rang all the way through and no answer. I wait 15 minutes, because they'd always call me back instantly. So I call them again and it rings once and goes to voicemail, so I assume they screened it because they were busy so I try again 10 minutes later and same thing. At this point I think it's odd so I try 4 more times within 20 minutes and the same thing everytime so I call on my house phone and it rings through with no answer and I know they dont recognize the number so i call right back and she answers and hears it's me and hangs up.. So I call again and it rings once and goes to voicemail, and kept doing that every call. So they blocked my number and were for real when they said they wouldn't see me anymore.. I spent over a grand a week for majority of the 2 years I used them, and minimum $400 a week and yet they block me for asking for a front when they had done it over 40 times for me.. They used to be the best and gradually got worse for some odd reason and then blocked me for the stupidest shit. Fuck em. 

Sorry I wrote this on a phone. 

TLDR: Honduran connect that I've been using for 2 years, and would spend over a grand a week on their stuff, blocked me this morning because I asked for a $20 front, when I've had 40+ fronts in those two years and always paid back on time, every time. Majority of those fronts were $80 fronts at a time too. ",1547775491.0

ah2dqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ah2dqs/withdrawal_different_depending_on_drug/,12,https://redd.it/ah2dqs,JKFishTrip,Withdrawal Different Depending on Drug?,"Ok, so of course depending on the half-life of different drugs the duration of the withdrawal will differ, and the intensity varies by dose but as a generalization since some drugs are consumed in larger doses (heroin) than some (codeine, hydrocodone), the H withdrawal will feel subjectively more intense to anyone going through it.

However: do the specific symptoms vary by each drug?

Before virtually ALL dope in my area had fentanyl as a cut, back when I had one steady supplier who'd sell the same stamp for months, the sickness had a few trademarks. 

Nowadays (or recently I should say--clean now), all the dope I have gotten my hands on in the last 2+ years has had fentanyl in it (confirmable by UAs and the police's lab analysis). 
Many around here also have ""tranq,"" which is some sort of fentalog nobody knows for sure the identity of. Possibly carfentanil. Would be nice to know. Increasingly, batches do not even contain ANY heroin at all, or they sprinkle in only a token amount so yeah, it's *technically* H cut with fentanyl, but functions more like fentanyl with heroin in it. Anyway, ever since the shift, the withdrawal just feels a little different...

Like for example, when it was just heroin, I couldn't eat if you asked me to even just 16 hours after my last bag(s). Fentanyl though, I've still eaten regular meals at the 30, 36 hour mark! It didn't sit well, and it left my body almost as fast as it went in, but I could mentally and physically stomach it.

Also, heroin--never got the cold sweats and temperature flux. Sure, a hot day in heroin withdrawal felt extra hot, the cold was freezing, and I'd get shivers down my spine and that kind of thing. But in more recent times, jeez...less than 24 hours later I start to sweat and get chills. Underneath a blanket or wearing a hoodie/long sleeves I feel so hot and sweaty. Take it off, no blanket or a thin sheet or shirtless or a t-shirt and I am so cold. Sometimes hot and cold at the same time. Sheets so drenched in sweat that I don't bother switching them til i get well--it's easier to wash one disgusting set of sheets than my whole roster of blankets, which I could easily ruin in a few hours. The hair allover my body stands up and I get goosebumps too. It feels like hell. Well, all withdrawal feels like hell, but heroin never did anything close to that (as it relates to that particular symptom).

Additionally:
It seems like I can sleep more consistently as I come off of fent versus heroin;
Fentanyl leaving my body leaves me with more tremors and a general shakiness compared to H;
And in general fent causes more stuff to ooze out of nearly ever hole in my body (teary eyes, sweating, runny nose, diarrhea, vomit if I go long enough, spontaneous ejaculation even!). Not that heroin didn't do most of those things, and that last one there being worse with F might be because the amount of fent being ingested exceeded the equivalent amount of H that was being ingested and thus naturally it'd feel more intense.

While I've tried many opiates/opioids, oxycodone and Suboxone are the only other two I have extensive experience with (daily use for more than a few weeks). For logical reasons I haven't felt anything comparable after stopping them:

Oxycodone I used when I first picked up a habit and seemed to 'get out of jail free' every time I'd stop after even a month or two binge; the last and largest binge I transitioned to dope at its terminus. One day 30's started actually costing $30 in my town, and overnight I switched from using blue pills to blue bags...If anything, the cessation from 30s was just cravings, anxiety, tension--mostly mental plus a diminished appetite and minor stuff like yawning, teary eyes, and worse restless legs than usual. Had I gone on to use heavy for longer, or if today I started doing blues for a few weeks and then stopped, surely I'd feel something more comparable in its intensity to the F and H.

Suboxone I've never had to genuinely detox from either even though I have taken it for months and months on end because every time I stop subs it is because I go back to doing dope like a dumbass...
I mean seriously, what was I thinking every time I did that shit? ""Steady job, great girlfriend, legal situation is better, finances improving, family trusting me again, apartment, dog, cat, people and animals relying on me? That's the perfect time to do the thing that fucks me over every single time by going on a months-long bender and just throw it all away! Fuck you; fuck me!""

I digress though...

Any thoughts on this one?",1547758504.0

I am in the middle of tapering off but I'm not trying to go cold turkey and quit all at once. I was thinking my last dose(after a few days reducing my intake) would be tomorrow. 

Is my tolerance going to affect my anesthesia? Is my usage something that I really need to even tell the doctor? I'm not even concerned about not getting good medication after as much as I am about them not wanting to do the surgery or just generally being lame about my usage. Has anyone gone through something similar? I've done a couple searches on here and some people say to tell the doctors, others say not to. Just wondering what I should do and if I'll be okay just stopping 10+ days before the surgery. I'm leaning towards just tapering off and not saying anything to the doctor. With that in mind, am I better off keeping with a decremented dosage of H, or should I switch to a suboxone?

I give my dgirl and her boyfriend $60 for halfs because, despite the fact that I’m broke af, I try to keep a good rep with them just in case I ever need their help. Welp, today I messaged the dude asking if I could get my usual half for 60. He said he only had grams. 

Didn’t make a lot of sense to me, thought he could just break a gram bag down in half and give me half. Instead he just gave me the g for 60. Wow, whoulda thunkit?

Thanking the opigods right now. Hope y’all get good today, or if you’re clean I hope you just have a generally good day :)

EDIT: They usually charge 50 for halfs. Probably woulda been good that I added that for context lol.",1547745599.0

My dealer is being watched by the cops , two people died of OD from his shit, now he's wanted. His house has been hot awhile now, but stil has people pull up front. Anyway, I been should've quit using by now , just started IOP. I was bringing him to new London the other day, and caught a flat tire just before we left( warning sign to stop). Another day had a cop pull right behind us , keeping a strange distance at a red light, before pulling a Uturn and leaving us alone ( probation told me my name was ran in the system, same day this happened. Must've seen all my car shit was legit and left me alone) and this morning 8am, I pull up front to bring him around for some moves, a undercover rolls by. Just before turning around and having three more squad cars roll up on me, just as my boy was about to walk out the front door. They ask me why I'm here I say giving someone a ride, they say who? I say that doesn't matter. They say why won't u tell us the name? I say because it's irrelevant. Well we're conducting an investigation and if u wanna be an asshole..well I said, I gave u my info, license etc etc, who I'm here to see is not your business. I'm not committing a crime and have not either, I know my rights and do not need to tell u who I'm here to see. Well this is a known drug house, and he has a warrant . I say well idk who he is ,I'm here for a girl. What's the girls name? Again , that doesn't matter. I don't need to tell u names. Anyway long story short I got let go, and didn't rat on anyone. I think this is a wrap on getting shit thru him now. I'm on probation and don't wanna go back to jail on some dumb shit. Anyway , know your rights people!",1547745260.0

Myself and several others have reached out to these people and offered assistance to provide rides, hotel room, food... etc.  

Last night myself and others did what we could to get a young lady who had been kicked out of treatment several thousand miles from her home, into a hotel room, fed and a ride home.   I was able go get her a room and another poster was generous enough to send her the cash to get home. 

Wouldn't it be nice if there was a crowd sourced fund where people who found themselves in fucked up situations like that could maybe apply for emergency assistance ?  While I understand that some might try to take advantage of it, a great many people who come here would benefit.  

Naturally, there would need to be rules... for example, the fund could be used to purchase a hotel room, bus/plane tickets, uber, food delivery, maybe even in store pick-up for warm clothing or toiletries, for folks who suddenly find themselves in urgent need after being booted from treatment.

Harm reduction is supposed to be about keeping people safe... saving lives and well, reducing the incidence of harmful effects on mental/physical health.  I feel that if someone wants to go to treatment and try to get clean, they should have every available opportunity to do so.. no matter if they have to do it 1, 2 or 10 times.. as long as they continue to try.  Families are not always understanding of this, and after having their sometimes unrealistic expectations dashed over and over again, they become unwilling to provide support.  It would be amazing if there were more resources out there that could help people right away from anywhere.

The longest time I was sober were 4 month after detox and rehab. Fuck man I just cant stand the PWDS cause I cant sleep and if I cant sleep then I go nuts. The last wds were super hard I was puking everything out directly after I drank water or eat anything. I was puking and shitting for four days.

And it would always get 1000x worse when I would get a girl friend bcuz I work very hard to hide my use and some would think I’m cheating on them and always question me about it. And some of them bcuz I get grouchy and irratiable and distant when going thru w/ds and normally I’m funny and goofy they think I’m bipolar and need to see a therapist the lies I make up start to confuse me at times and it gets out of control. And I’m single now bcuz I wanted to get sober I mean shit I do love opis but I know I’m never gonna have the life I want with me using them and I’ve been working on weaning my self off I mean it’s been a year but I’ve gone from 240 mg of oxy a day in dec 2017 to about 30 mg a day currently and there where points where it would be as low as 5 mg a day in certain points in 2018 so it’s a long process but I feel I’m getting close anyway sorry for getting off track but i guess Im asking how many years in or at what point did it change for you?

Don't pick opiates up if you haven't thus far in your life. I know most of you will do the complete opposite but before you do just know a few things...

- Once you pick opiate usage up it will be the hardest thing in your life to put down. Even if your able to put it down you will always want to pick it back up.

- Enjoy being broke 24/7 because you need your fix. Even if your not broke broke you will not have nearly as much as you would have if you never tried it that first time.

- Do you enjoy being alone? I mean alone alone no friends, family, etc. because you will lose them all chasing your fix and even if you think you have friends they are just there to get high off your stuff. Once the drugs and money are gone so will they.

- Once you finally decide to give up the opiates they will follow for months with the sickness and withdraws you will experience removing them from your body. Hot and cold sweats, vomiting, shaking, anxiety, and more... 

Once you bring opiates into your life your going to have 4 choices to pick from for the rest of your life... 

1) Dealing with the sickness of withdraws and living with the monkey on your back for the rest of your life wanting you to do them one more time. 

2) Going to jail for some dumb shit on opiates or to get your fix of opiates to keep you from dealing with withdraws.

3) Being a junky the rest of your life and lose everything and everyone that was in your life one by one and sit there and watch your life crumble infront of you but you take another hit or pop another pill to ease the pain and not care.

4) Death... Unfortunately it happens to some of the best people you could ever think of but that is part of the game that your playing with your life.

Hopefully this will stop just one first timer from trying opiates because this is not the game you want to join. There are no such thing of winning in the game of opiates. The whole game is based on losing starting from money to friends and family, then comes your car and house and finally if you keep playing you will lose your life unfortunately ether it be jail or death.",1547710598.0

So a quick back story: I was clean for about 4 years, with the help of suboxone, relapsed about a year ago & have been using ever since. 

I’m trying to get back to the sober life. I work in a steel mill & trying to do all of this without burning vacation days & was going to attempt when I get a few days off.   I have a few questions regarding the route I want to take.

1. I want to use kratom to help with the withdrawals. My state currently classifies kratom as illegal, so am I not allowed to order from the web? I am very close to a neighboring state where kratom is legal. If I went to a shop that carries kratom, is the quality just as good as buying it off the web? If there’s a way to just order online I would prefer to go that route.

2. I’ve heard/seen from many posts on here that gabapentin does wonders for withdrawal. I don’t know anyone in my group of friends that has any, or knows anyone that does. What’s the best way to be able to get it prescribed?

3. I have plenty of bunavail (different brand of suboxone) left over from when I was sober. I’m pretty sure I’ll end up getting back on that, I just know that takes a little longer to stabilize on it since you have to wait 48-72 hours.

Just a few questions I had before I attempt the sober life again, I’m ready to get this monkey off my back again for good. Thank you guys for all the help, laughs, & great conversations. To those still using, be safe, & to those that are sober, keep on keeping on ❤️",1547699505.0

Here is how I did it.,"I've been writing for over an hour and keep having to wipe my process because I slip in too much detail that could identify me. Here is the condensed version (we are talking another 10 paragraphs before)

This is a modified take of the ""three day suboxone taper"" which says to dose lower and lower over three days.

WARNING: This guide mentions taking a large dose of suboxone. If you are a low tolerance user this is likely FAR TOO MUCH AND COULD POTENTIALLY BE FATAL. ADJUST ACCORDINGLY. Seriously, if you have only been a daily user for 2 weeks and doing just 60mg of oxy a day, do not do this.

You will need:

1. Suboxone (about 3x8mg)
2. Kratom (read up on good strains for opiate withdrawals.
3. Loperamide. Yep, anti shit pills. Don't need the huge bottle but it is a good value at walmart, get it anyways.
4. Alcohol. Your choice (probably not beer though) Yep. I chose to fight my demons with an old demon friend ;)
5. Gatorade. Hydration will help you and your body a lot in this process. Being dehydrated (day one I tried drinking water all day and was still pissing dark yellow)
6. To watch this video on WHY addiction happens: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg&feature=youtu.be Seriously, this did a lot for me. You WILL learn something from this that will help you.
7. Plan your last dose to be in the morning so you are withdrawing in the afternoon. If you are able to, plan this around when you can have 3ish days off. KEEP TRACK OF WHEN YOU LAST DOSED.
8. Here is what you do with it. You're going to use the Kratom and Loperamide to get you through early withdrawals before taking the suboxone. No more than 10mg Loperamide, 10g kratom for day one. Got it? You know you more than I do. For me, 12 hours seemed to always be the point where I'd be in enough withdrawal to take suboxone. That means take the kratom and loperamide at the the 3/4 mark, or for my case, 9 hours after the last dose. Keep track of the time since your last dose. We need it again. You will be withdrawing of heroin but not feeling like it. I was at the 12 hour mark, I waited till 14. Whatever your ""withdrawal number"" is, add 2-3 hours to it. At that point, take 8mg of the suboxone and wait for it to fully dissolve/absorb. Actually, you've made it this far in this list, take TWO! Thats right. Night one we kick off with 16mg of suboxone. This dose will flood your brain. You dont want to take them both at once in case you happen to throw up, have to talk on a phone, anything that will cause it to just salivate away. This way you can salvage one. The steps for night one are complete. If you cant sleep, drink a little. Its okay, you earned it.
9. Day two is upon us. Get up, and reflect on yourself. Say ""I havent used heroin in 24 hours...and I feel fine."" Feels great doesnt it. Wait 24 hours since last suboxone dose, and take the last 8mg. Tonight should be easier. If you are REALLY having a hard time, take loperamide and kratom again. Avoid otherwise, I'll explain later. Again, alcohol if needed for sleep only. Do not day drink.
10. Wait, we are on Day THREE already? All right! You would conceivably be in the WORST of it for today if you went cold turkey. Today we aren't taking any opiates or antagonist though. It isn't as scary as it seems however. The incredibly long halflife of suboxone will leave you fine all day long. Trust me. Do not take anything today. Take Kratom at night before bed if you cant sleep. More to come tomorrow.
11. Day four. The suboxone in your system is getting low, but your body is almost done with withdrawals of heroin, and we arent giving it enough time to get hooked on suboxone, which is very gently depleting its self at a slow rate. You may be back at work at this point, and scared you are going to withdraw. Nope. We have been trying to avoid kratom the last three days if possible so we dont use it as a crutch if we dont need to, or build new dependancy. Now its time for the three day Kratom bender. Take a few doses of kratom today, as needed.
12. Days five, six. Taper down the kratom. If you get a high off it, you're doing too much. This is about feeling normal, not high. If you think a better option for you is to do kratom the rest of your life...by all means do it. It is far less self destructive than heroin. I'll still be far happier for you, and so will you.
13. Day SEVEN. ONE. WEEK. Did you keep track of the time since you last dosed like I said? You wake up and it has been a week since you last used heroin. You may have some small lingering effects. I was an exclusive heroin smoker of over a gram a day. My first few days I woke up coughing and choking on mucus, then going into a small sneezing fit, before being fine the rest of the day. That has seriously been my only problem.
14. What if I screw up? Well, heres the thing. If you fuck up, you just cant restart this process. If you fuck up twice, you cannot return to this process immediately. You will have to wait. Otherwise you're just going to be dependent on probably suboxone and kratom and it wont work for you the same. The goal is to replace one drug with another, then another, then none. All before your body gets hooked to it, all while the other drugs are completely hiding the massive heroin withdraw you are actually in.
15. If you paid attention and watched the video I provided, you will understand that it is possible you didnt become addicted just because heroin is well, addictive. Heroin only has a [capture rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence#Capture_rates) of 23.1%. You used heroin as an escape from life. Something I did over first 3 days was watch a lot of music videos, interviews, concerts, etc getting really interested into one of my old favorite bands (The Smashing Pumpkins, of course. Shout out to James Jimmy D'arcy and the legend William Patrick Corgan. You guys rock and helped me through this) and just watched anything that would get my attention. At one point I had over 60 chrome tabs open. This was me on a path of rediscovery and reconnecting with my happier days. Most importantly, here is what you MUST do to stay clean. You need to ditch the habits heroin-you has, and move forward as someone new, not back as the person that led you to this mess. Go out. Contact old friends. Start working out. Get on Tinder, Okcupid, etc. You have a spouse? You guys kicking it together? GREAT. Happy for you, go out and try something new (not drugs) and see why you connected in the first place (unless that reason was also heroin in which case...fuck)
16. Final points. You need to separate yourself. Burn bridges. Throw away your gear. You cant have the old life around when new life is trying to get shit done. I'm still applying to jobs across the country just to hope I don't come back (this is ironic given my deleted many paragraphs of how I got started, by moving to a new area and being alone, lol, problem was I was still close enough to drive 3 hours every night)


Any questions or comments? Am I giving bad advice? It worked amazing for me, and I hope it can for others. This really was easy. The hardest part is the new person bit, its winter and fucking cold. Oh well, at least I'm not standing out in it waiting for heroin for an hour.",1547693374.0

         About 4 months ago, I was sitting alone at home around noon. Boredom had reached a peak. I thought to myself “Am I just going to sit here another Friday by myself with nothing to do but play video games? I never do shit anymore.”


          I decided to hop on Twitter to see what was happening in the world. Like lightning had struck, one of my favorite metal bands had just tweeted that moment “We’ve added a show in (location redacted) on our tour. Doors open at 6.” 


    I didn’t think i was going to see them this time around on tour. The closest location they were playing was 5 hours away so I had already chalked that up as a no-go. But Lady Luck had her eye on me and this location was only 2 hours and 30 minutes away. That was doable.


       So I checked the bank account, I had juuust enough to get 10 15s, gas to get up there & back, and a ticket to this show. Hell yes! So I got up and made the phone call to my plug, drove 30 mins to pick up my meds, and I was off on my spur of the moment adventure.


       I drove the 180 miles to cross the state line,  drove the other 20 into the city, then I arrived at the venue a little early and got in line. There were a ton of people ahead of me. So many people that I couldn’t even see the door.


     Fast forward 30 minutes, the line started moving.


       “Man, this line is taking forever. Why aren’t they just taking tickets & will call and letting us through!” I thought. Little did I know that my whole world was about to turn upside down.


       I finally got close enough to the doors to see that something else is going on. A fucking POLICE SEARCH OF EVERYONE GOING THROUGH! They were checking pockets, dumping purses, running their hands along waistlines, making people OPEN THEIR MOUTHS , and other weird but thorough searching techniques.


       “Oh fuck!” I thought, “if they’re going to check everywhere on my body, maybe the cigarette pack would be the safest place to put my Roxys (5 15s left) and straw since I just empty my pockets, body search, and go inside.” 


       “Sorry, you’re not a winner” is an old metal song I used to love..... This also just so happened to describe my situation ever so perfectly.


     I got up to the front of the line. I brought all of my belongings out of my pockets, kept them in my hand while they were searching my body. Holy shit, were they thorough! After that, I started to lay down my things on the table. 


       The lady cop said “Sir, can you please hand me your cigarette packs. We’ve been warned of people bringing drugs into the show in their cigarette packs.”


      “WHAT THE FUCK!” This phrase kept rattling around in my head. Time slowed. I knew I was a goner. 200 miles away from home with no way out of this line. I start to hand them to her. One opened, pills and a straw inside, one unopened. 


     My hands started shaking, my panic disorder kicked in. I knew that in this state, it’s an automatic felony and they will prosecute you to the utmost of their ability. Sometimes even making up different names to charge you on a per pill basis. This didn’t help the pain in my chest.


      “Thump”....one of my cigarette packs hit the ground. I reached down quickly and grabbed it. The other one she grabbed out of my hand.... 


       “Huh. This pack is unopened.” She said to me.


     “Oh yeah, they both are. Sorry I should’ve made that clear. My bad!” I chuckled back to her in a shaking, but sweet tone.


     “Okay. Don’t forget your belongings here on the table and have a good time!” She said to me with a genuine smile.


       My heart beat was in my throat. I was holding back tears of despair from before, had now combined with tears of relief. 


     A girl wearing a band shirt took my ticket and I asked her where the bathroom was. She explained but before she could finish, I scurried as quickly yet contained as I could manage, following her directions as if I already knew. I got in a stall and started gasping for air. “How could I have made it through that! Seriously! Why didn’t she check the other pack? Why? Why? Why?” I kept asking myself, feeling like I was going to explode.


     I sat down on the toilet, hands still shaking like a leaf on a windy day. I pulled out the cigarette pack that ALMOST sealed my fate. I shook out a 15, loaded it into my straw, crushed it up on the wall of the stall and my BIC, sniffed, and blasted off. The rush of dopamine was so intense that I almost blacked out. 


     I gathered myself and went in front of the stage, eager to hear my favorite bands play. But more importantly, I was thankful to whoever or whatever was watching over me. I could’ve spent the week in a huge metropolitan jail with no one to get me out. I still feel blessed to this day.



     Thank you everyone who stuck around to the end. This took a lot of time to write but I’ve been meaning to get this up so others can learn from my mistake. I should’ve been more crafty in my approach to hide my meds. Hindsight is 20/20 though.


TLDR: Almost got arrested on multiple counts of possession & paraphernalia charges before going into a metal show. “God” kept me from going to jail in a big city where I definitely would’ve gotten my ass kicked and been in for a while. Also, you should read the whole thing! I feel it’s definitely worth the time and effort!

This is legit one of my favorite subs, full of amazing people and a strong love vibe I love to read all your posts and your stories even tho I never tried H or any painkillers, and don't plan to.

I tried Kratom once a few years ago, it was a Bali red vein if my memory serves, it was a bliss, I melted with the couch and really relaxed me in a way no other substance ever did before.

I want to try it again and wanted to know how fiendish this substance really is, at first I wanted to ask in /r/Kratom but I saw them being harsh with an user here just because pointing out its addiction potential so I'll skip.

Is it worth it? I don't plan to start a new addiction, nobody does...I know...but I'm curious to try it again since I don't remember well the effects and I just want something to chill with.

What's your suggestions?

May JJ be with you all!

agokxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/agokxv/my_old_dealeri_mean_doctor/,40,https://redd.it/agokxv,Jamie-R,My old dealer...I mean doctor,"Hello everyone! I wanted to share my story about my old pain doctor. This all started when I was about 25, so this was roughly 10 years ago. A rumor started circulating about a doctor that would give you anything as long as you had cash. With nothing to lose, I gave it a try. I gave him cash upfront for the initial visit ($1,000), wasn't guaranteed anything & just spent my whole savings... so I was freaked out! The visit lasted about 3 hours. He asked some strange questions & was just weird all together. I noticed quick that he never asked for MRI's or any kind of records. He simply said ""what kind of pain meds work for you""? Without skipping a beat, I said Oxycontin. He was fine with that & asked what mg I've taken. I told him 80 mg. Again, he didn't give me any weird looks or concern that a ""normal"" doctor would do with a 25 year old healthy patient. At this point, I knew I was walking out of there with at least something. In fact he said, ""besides pain, do you want something to help with sleep & anxiety?"" I said something along these lines, ""Now that you mention that, I do have issues with sleep & anxiety."" When I left the initial visit I was blown away with what he gave me. I had a script for 120 Oxy 80's (4 a day & this was back when they were all the OC ones), 240 30's (8 a day), 90 10mg Valium and 180 10mg Methadone. I happily went to the pharmacy where my total bill was $75 for everything because my insurance kicked ass!! LOL. Each time I went back, he would bump me up. 3 months in he took me up from 120 80's to 180 80s (6 a day). The rest of the meds stayed the same. I liked my oxys, so I typically sold the methadone or kept some back in case I would run out early. I would normally run out after 3 weeks but knew other people who went to him, so finding it wasn't a big deal.

\*\*\*\*\* Here's where it gets crazy!!! \*\*\*\*\*\*

Within a year, he was giving me 240 Oxy 80's (8 a day), 360 Roxy 30's (12 a day), 120 10mg Valium (4 a day), 360 10mg Methadone (120 mg a day), 120 Somas & he also prescribed me Mirilax due to constipation....I was blocked up BAD!! lol. After the initial visit, I only paid $800 cash each month (Around $900 total for visit & scripts). The $900 was never a problem. I had a few friends who put up that money each month for me & in return, I'd give them the 80's for $35 a piece (going rate was around $50 to $60 where I lived in 2009). At this point in my life as a 25 year old, this was the best thing I thought life had to offer but knew this wasn't going to last forever. Everyday was good though & whoever I was hanging with that day was well taken care of. I had lots of ""friends"" until I stopped getting them.

This doctor quickly became known for the massive amounts of pills he gave out but continued to go hard & just do his thing!! After about 2 years of getting these scripts, I accidentally overdosed. Out of all the things I was getting, the combo of Oxy, valium and Soma took me out. My mother happened to come in to ask if I wanted anything from the store & she found me on the floor, blue, not breathing & pills around me (I must have had my bottle open when it happened & fell) I ended up in the hospital, got a shot of narcan, evaluated & was sent home. After that, I never took Somas or wanted to do the Soma-Shuffle ever again (who knows about the soma shuffle?? lol)! The ER doctor called my pain doc to tell him what happened. I thought he was going to cut me off but NOPE!! Get this...He (the pain doctor) called me personally to ask how I was doing, told me to be safer, wished me well and asked if I would be coming to my next appt the following week...which I did of course. LOL!! He never once even seemed concerned about what happened & never spoke of it again. Think about it, if he gets 10 patients a day at $800 a person, that's $8,000 a day, $40,000 a week & it was all CASH!  Yes, he prescribed me a lot of stuff but there were people getting MUCH more than I was! From what I was told, the amount he gave me was a typical amount for his regulars. Cancer patients or terminal patients were getting massive amounts. He literally was supplying multiple counties where I live. To make a long story short, shit eventually hit the fan. Towards the end of his run, pharmacies wouldn't fill ANY of his prescriptions for fear that they would end up in trouble for filling these massive amounts of oxys for people who didn't really need them. My heart goes out to those who truly need it but can't because of things like this.  My last visit there I happened to see 2 guys sitting in a car just watching his office. It looked sketchy but I was about 12 steps away from getting my scripts & 30 minutes away from getting them filled & back on the road so I could get home, so seeing those guys were the last thing on my mind. I later found out they were FBI or something like that casing his doctors office. I wasn't worried because I wasn't doing anything wrong, had legal prescriptions & I had my friend drive me each month & never drove to his office for fear I'd get a DUI on my way home. With that many 80s, 30's & benzos, the ride home was pretty nice!  Within a week of my last visit, he got shut down.

\*\*\*\* Some people think I'm making this up due to the amounts I was getting. I have nothing to prove, so if you don't believe me...I don't really care. lol In the following articles, you will see what he was giving other patients. In fact he was having a patient wear 6..yes 6 Fentanyl patches at a time!

This link will tell you what happened to my doctor when he was arrested (2014):

[https://triblive.com/news/adminpage/6074414-74/davis-patients-federal](https://triblive.com/news/adminpage/6074414-74/davis-patients-federal)

&#x200B;

This is when he was sentenced (2016):

[https://www.tribdem.com/news/pain-doctor-gets-years-in-prison-for-overprescribing-pills/article\_d5ff637e-daae-11e5-b065-cffbbad5cd71.html](https://www.tribdem.com/news/pain-doctor-gets-years-in-prison-for-overprescribing-pills/article_d5ff637e-daae-11e5-b065-cffbbad5cd71.html)

&#x200B;

After he got shut down, I got clean for awhile but started taking suboxone for a few months after a relapse with 30s. At $30 a piece it wiped my bank acct out QUICK!! I never realized as an addict how nice I had it at one point - never had to pay for anything, never worried about being sick on the holidays or waiting on someone else to drop stuff off so I could get well. I eventually quit suboxone too. I thought getting hundreds of 80s & 30s each month was the best thing in life. Boy was I wrong! I now have a family, wonderful career, my dream of owning a VW Bus (just bought it 2 years ago) & a 6 year old beautiful daughter. Those are truly the best things in my life & better than any drug..in my opinion. With the amount of pills I had, I'm so grateful I didn't die. I'll never judge anyone who uses & realize it can be fun to a point. I do miss the euphoria & rituals that came with it but I'd choose what I have now over all of that!  While being clean isn't as fun or adventurous, I have money in my bank, pay ALL my bills & never have to worry about waking up sick & that's an amazing feeling!! Yes, I smoke weed, hang with my family & watch my daughter grow up (I love being a dad!!) & that to me is better than any high I ever had. I'm no better than anyone else & don't judge. I also know the loneliness feeling, being sick, feeling lost or feeling like I was never going to go anywhere in life & not having any real friends. The friends I had were those friends who would steal your shit then help you look for it. haha!!  In all seriousness, if you're struggling & truly want to stop, get help...there's no shame in asking for help. A few days or weeks of being uncomfortable is worth a lifetime of pure happiness & good memories. I'm glad I got clean & realize that some of you just don't want to or aren't ready yet & that's ok!! - Only you can decide what you want & when you want it. If you never used an opiate and reading this thread & possibly curious and want to try oxys or heroin, please don't try it. It may feel good at first but I'm sure anyone here will tell you that it quickly fades away & that's when the W/D's and bullshit start. 

If you're using today, be safe.  Regardless what you do in your lives, I wish you all nothing but happiness & good health!

Uh, no it won't. Try and hit up dude from A LONG TIME AGO. I quit this shit a while back, but I still take it for pain like when I get a damn tooth pulled. 

Anyway dude is gone. Probably in jail now, whatever. 

I dont debate or ask for pain meds when given none. But this was the first tooth extraction I'd ever had without getting norco or something.  I've also never gotten a refill on my pain meds when given them. I just take them and go about my life. 

So I go home and get some xanax and adavan from my family and muscle through it. 

Well today I have a dry socket (because they didnt give me pain meds I wasnt about to not smoke weed.) It should also be mentioned that ibuprofen reactivates a ulcer from taking too much last year do to a tooth issue. 

But fuck it, I try and take some. Wake up with a miserable feeling of being punched in the upper gut and crying so hard on my knees my husband wanted to take me to the ER.  

So no more ibuprofen.  And no real pain meds. And this dry socket is killing me. 


I hate how hard the pendulum is swinging the other way now where doctors and dentists are not giving out to those who truly need it. 


I just needed to rant and didnt know where else to go.  

I have never drug seeked from a doctor or dentist nor would I. Ive always been able to find drugs on the street. Until I quit a few years ago. Now I know nobody that sells anything outside of weed. So here I am fucked out of what can truly help because the medical field is abandoning what really works.  

I was fine when it was just the tooth extraction. I can muscle through a few days of that pain. But this dry socket is killing me.  Guess I just take more xanax.  

I actually hate benzos, but oh well. Better than being miserable.    


Didn't know where else to bitch, thanks for reading.  


Edit:  took my kratom for the first time today since  my tooth was pulled on friday (I toss and wash didnt want to mess up the open socket, ironically 😑)  but its helped tremendously.  Very happy to have this and shouldn't need to call the dentist.

On Monday night, my old middleman beat me. Claims he got arrested that night but I’ve caught him in the lie in more than one way, and when asking for proof of the arrest he just got furious and texted me in all caps like a child. I think he uses reddit, so I hope your bitchass sees this buddy.

Anyway, when I’m dealing with this new guy, what are some ways to ensure I don’t lost my money? Here’s what I have so far, please tell me if you have anything to add. It’s happened one too many times and I just feel like a dumbass, I can’t afford to lose any more money.

1. Don’t let my money walk off if at all possible

2. If he needs to leave the car with my money, he has agreed to leave his cell phone with me, I will verify that the cell phone is actively on a subscription and has value to him before handing over cash. (I’ve gotten beat with a fake phone this way before)

3. I am picking him up 20 minutes from me, and driving the next 40 mins into the city where we’re gonna cop, I like to think this will give me added security, cause I can’t imagine someone stranding themselves a 40 minute car ride from home for $60-80 bucks (starting small for the first couple cops)",1547646392.0

Temperature probably in the low 60s. A “drug friend” gets back into my car and hands me a bag with 100mg of street heroin. I took a conservative test shot and was overwhelmed immediately with the rush. Feeling nauseas, I exited the car with my drug-addled acquaintance to get food inside the Subway sandwich store in an attempt to help my stomach. While realizing I’m extremely high but not fully grasping the gravity of the situation, I gave my drug friend permission to call the ambulance if I started nodding out too hard because I felt it coming on. 
I went outside, unable to eat. My drug friend followed me. I didn’t make it very far before I made a decision which I vaguely remember. 
I remember taking my hoodie off and putting it  on the asphalt. I laid down on my jacket, planning to take a nap because I felt tired. Next thing I knew I was being greeted by paramedics and police officers. I had overdosed and they injected me with whatever they use before they go on to Narcan. I didn’t even need the Narcan, which would have made me go into immediate and terrible withdrawals. I was high as could be and went to the hospital and sat in the hall for an hour and puked my brains out and left. Fucked up part is I called another friend and told him that I would give him my dope if he picked me up from the hospital and then I lied to him and said I couldn’t find the dope. Went and shot up right after. 

Another crazy one

About a month after that previous incident, I did a fat shot of some heroin and realized that I had a strong batch so I immediately started putting together a homemade Narcan shot out of suboxone and water. I realized I would pass out before I could get it ready so I ate a strip of suboxone, hoping it might save me in time (it contains naloxone). I don’t remember passing out, I just remember coming back to awareness very slowly and realizing that I couldn’t move my arms or legs because the circulation was cut off and they were numbed fully. I then slowly started moving around and was able to stand up and prepare a shot of suboxone while nodding in and out. I thought I would die at any moment. I finally got the shot in my vein and puked my guts out.

First of all, I promise I’m a better writer than this and what I’ve shown in the past. When I type on my phone it all sounds like shit because my brain thinks faster than my fingers can type on a shitty phone keyboard. I’m not as dumb as I sound, for whatever that’s worth.

I apologize for the rant. It’s been an impossibly difficult few days and I’m running on empty and just want so badly to be heard, so please bear with me. <3

In the past I’ve gotten off heroin, but I’ve never tried complete abstinence from all mind altering substances before now. I’ve managed to get five months so far. 

I just moved to a new state to start fresh and get clean/sober from all mind altering substances. I’ve been using for thirteen years, so it’s essentially all I know. Sobriety is new to me and it’s been great at times, albeit a little underwhelming.

Through treatment and because the area I’ve moved to is VERY recovery oriented, I’ve met some amazing people in this journey. The problem is that they’ve all fucking relapsed. Even one of the treatment staff at my sober living went out and overdosed (she survived, thank god) and she had years of sobriety.

The pain I’m feeling for all of the friends I’ve made feels like it’s too much to bear. I’m tired of feeling feelings. I’m bored, restless, anxious, and just want to get out of my own head. I’m angry at my best friend for getting high. I’m resentful that she doesn’t seem to care about her sobriety, and I’m resentful for selfish reasons. It feels like I NEED her to care about her sobriety so that I can stay sober myself. I love her and it’s fucked up because it feels like my sobriety is so heavily revolved around her. (I’m a straight female, I just really adore this girl). I know I’ve got codependency issues. Working on it all.

I attend meetings frequently and work with my sponsor but I just feel fed up. It doesn’t feel like any progress has been made, and I feel like I’m wasting my life away when I just want to get fucking high. 

Sober living is fucking with me. I keep getting roommates that are horrific and I’m trying to have compassion & understand that they’re having a hard time, too, but the snoring/messes they leave interfere with my sleep and peace of mind. 

Someone stole my medication last week, which is also interfering with my ability to think rationally and feel calm.

I have been using heroin for going on 3 years (2 intravenously). I do not use daily, at max I use like 3 or 4 times a week. Currently I've used for the first time in a week and a half yesterday evening and just a bit ago now. I've used methods in the past like taking Benadryl (diphenhydramine) or Dramamine before use. And this usually helps IMMENSELY. But, sometimes I don't have the opportunity to dose these meds for whatever reason and I'm left with nausea and vomitting that makes the high almost un pleasant. Are there any other methods to avoid the nausea? And are there any ways to reduce it once you have dosed? Thank you opi fam and happy nods!!",1547615947.0

But I think I edited it to be much more readable! (I hope, because I’m very curious if I’m alone here) 

So I go back and fourth between oxy/dope and kratom or subs (lately subs) now I just started dope like a week ago and I know they say there’s prob fent in all ECP dope, but my oxy tolerance was 90-120mg pharma IRroxys 30s (so I’ve never tried fent always had from pharma from a buddy) and When I tried dope I ended up sniffing .1 lines all night with a buddy and was fine. I feel like if that had fent I’d be nodded out for days. I didn’t nod at all and no euphoria but I had oxy in system from that morning and my body can’t produce enough of whatever it takes for that euphoria more than once a day. 

I had enough dope to last a week, from when I first tried it. So I binged on it, Everyday no euphoria, using like .5 grams/day doing roughly 6-10 lines a day.  

I made that post about it being underwhelming. So I took a break of 3 days I used just the smallest amount of subs to keep me not sick which was like 1-1.5mg/day. But my last line of D was 2am sat night, I was at a casino hotel lol then didn’t need a suboxone till I was back home and I took 1mg Sunday night like 2am when I woke up sweating and felt like shit and Monday about 1.5 mg at 4pm 

Today I got dope at around 5pm I used at like 6 and finally I got that euphoric feeling again!!! But it took two bags (idk what they weigh but should be .1 I doubt it some are bigger/smaller) I than did another bag with .5 Xanax and nothing more. Again my body can only get that euphoria once a day. So I’m hoping in the am it works ok. 

My buddy has some oxy for me in the am he’s giving me for a ride to court, so I’m gonna mix some w the dope. I sniff and never IVed dope but my ROA of oxy was oral. I’d take Cemetidine than chew it up, Idk if anyone else experiences this where they simply cannot get that high they desire more than once a day.   And  if you use everyday,  you eventually don’t get the euphoria at all the next morn if your last dose at night is too close to your dose in the am. 

Fuck my body really sucks I don’t get. For someone with no H tolerance I was able to go through 1.5 grams  in like 3-4 hours with a buddy so .75 each, He was mangled, I was totally fine no nods at all. 

I could go on and on about how these drugs effect me so different than anyone I know but I won’t bore you. I’m just curious if anyone has the same effects. And I’ll let you know how it goes tm. I bought 7 bags tonight I was planning on doing 3.5 but, the last one ripped open so I did 4. 

I Started with 2, after a test bump, and felt really good for like an hour then I ate dinner kinda sobered up, I took about .5-1mg Xanax and sniffed another 2 bags and feel fine now, never regained that euphoria just very relaxed and afterglow of opiate feeling. 

Tm morn I have 3 bags left ima sniff one bag with the 30mg oxy hopefully that’s enough. And then just maintain w the other 2 since I won’t be able to take subs until the next day most likely anyways.  

So just wondering if anyone here experience the same thing or, is it just my body it’s shitty natural tolerance to most drugs? Thanks for putting up with the novel! ",1547610409.0

Before that I had taken up to 200mg of DHC and it never felt that intense/lasted that long.

I have been trying to get ahold of my dgirl all day long to get my usual .5. The last dose I had was a small .2 this morning. It got me well, but not high. She usually responds immediately, but I messaged her at noon and she doesn’t text me back until 530 with a “coming.”

She only lives a 10-15 minute drive from me, but I knew it would take longer than that because of usual dgirl/dboy time lol. It’s 6:30 when she texts me that she’s pulling up so I can meet her at the front of my apartment complex.

I go out to meet her and we do the usual trade. Money and dope exchange hands through the car window, a strong smell of burning blunts and slightly loud rap music emitting from the car. I saunter through the walk-gate back into the complex and back to my apartment building. Straight to the bathroom I go.

I get into the bathroom and assess the situation. The bag I received is a little fatter than usual. She hooked it up. This could be because she just reupped so she’s feeling generous, or maybe because she took so long to get back to me today. Could possibly be a little bit of both too. The smell of the dope is quite different than usual. Her tar usually has a little more of a muted (yet still strong) vinegary smell, but today it almost makes me sneeze from how strong it smells. I’ve had dope from her that smells like this, so I’m not alarmed in the least bit by it. 

I decide on dosing with a good .375ish amount. I can handle .5 shots very well. I thought the .375 would get me a good high and save me enough dopes for a decent shot tomorrow morning. I mix the dope in my spoon with little difficulty and no abnormality in consistency or feel. I always mix with my finger so that I notice a difference in texture throughout my dope. 

No red flags today. I pull up the solution into the rig and see a nice big dark shot of tarry goodness. If you were to see the shot, it would probably look like too much to you, but tar shots have a tendency to do that. I tie off with the usual blood-stained cargo belt, register in my hand in about 2 seconds, and push off the whole shot in about 2 seconds. 

I quickly pull the rig out, put up the belt, and stand up. I always stand after doing a shot  because I’ve been told that I can get a better rush that way and I guess I convinced myself it works so I keep doing it. I pull water into the rig to clean it out and start to get the rush. I quickly notice that it’s coming on quite harder than usual.

I look into the mirror and look at my eyes. I feel my body getting weak, my knees starting to shake. I drop the rig on the floor and grab the counter for stability as my knees are shaking vigorously. Before I can sit myself down, my knees give out and I hit the floor.

I’m okay. I didn’t hit my head or anything. My ears are ringing and my sister yells through the door “YO RAVIOPI! YOU OKAY?!?”  She knows I used to use, but everybody in the apartment is under the impression that I quit months ago. I muster out a “Yeah, I just dropped something,” trying to sound as nonchalant as I could. It worked.

I slowly pull myself up off the ground and hold on tight to the bathroom counter while fighting with all my will not to lose consciousness. After standing there for a moment with the water running, I start to get a little better. I calm down. I’m still very very very high, but I’m not like almost-OD high anymore lol.

I make sure everything in the bathroom is cleaned up. I triple check to make sure I didn’t leave anything incriminating around before I walk out and plop straight into my bed where I can rest and be half asleep without looking TOO sketchy. 

I’ve been trying to type this out for over an hour and a half, so sorry about the grammar, spelling, and syntax of my words. I know it’s really long,but when I’m high I tend to ramble on and on about the things that aren’t even vital to the post. B

Moral of the story: ALWAYS DO TEST SHOTS, EVEN IF YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THIS DOPE IS ANY DIFFERENT THAN USUAL.

EDIT: changed “kitchen counter” to “bathroom counter.” I was too high when I was writing that to have a coherent train of thought.

I've had some extended release 60mg DHC last week and did the normal thing, crushed them, the bottle went in 4 days, but man was that a good four days. I find crushed DHC Continus to be extremely effectively at inducing euphoria. Bottles of 10mg/5ml oral morphine didn't do as good a job.

Now I have normal 30 DHC which normally I find is far less euphoria inducing than codeine, even when my tolerance is very low. I am an efficient CYP2D6 converter which may have something to do with it.

I tried crushing my DHC normal pills today and found they did induce a far better nod than I've had with DHC before.

I know the crushing with Continus is to destroy the extended release and get most of the drug at once - so would crushing standard DHC do anything? Allow quicker absorption, or is it it just a case of confabulation? ",1547586884.0

A sample on repeat played while my friends laughed at inside jokes. All of a sudden everything was wrong in the office where I sat alert and upright. 


I gasp as I bolt up right in my bed, my back is full of hot knives stabbing directly above my right hip. I look to my left as I reel in agony. My girlfriend lays there curled up against the wall wrapped in her special thick beige blanket she claimed as hers the first night I we slept in my apartment. Ah love, warm and beautiful, through heavy rose glasses. But the knives stabbing my back with every wincing movement drop me quickly back to reality. My bones ache as pain antagonizes the opiate receptors in my mind. My entire body retaliates against this day as it does every day. I get to bathroom to do my daily shit, shave, get ready routine. Brushing my teeth my joints crack like dry branches, I look around while I get ready for work. The room is a disaster the bed has a fitted sheet and two separate blanket lumps, there are clothes everywhere in ""dirty, mixed, and cleanish piles"" as my girlfriend calls them. But the bathroom is the worst, a clearly shut in bachelor look comprises the area. The sink and mirror looks like a drug addict tried to organize porrly. Eye drops, drops of blood, small pill chunks and other paraphernalia cover the whiped down half of the vanity and mirror. The other half has two toobrushes, toothpaste, hair gel and deodorant spread about. ""maybe I'll clean after work"" I say softly to myself. Before I leave the room I kiss Brooke and softly whisper ""I love you"". She is an incredibly sound sleeper, I know my kiss and words are not registered by her body but I hope her spirit feels me. though I had never felt comfort from hers.


My work is a soul sucking place that, takes any hope of easy days and destroys them by your supposed lunch break. I drive with my roommate, best friend, and occasional boss Adin. My once four thousand dollar 2001 beige sedan blasted Fight For Your Right by the Beastie Boys. We rapped along as we sped around in second gear to warm the engine. Adin was in a good mood, as our boss was always gone on Thursdays. He got up on time plus we were stopped in the drive through at Starbucks waiting on four huge, triple espresso, white chocolate, complicated, coffees. Adin pulled a half burnt bowl of good crystallized weed out of the glovebox, and was finishing pulling an expertly cornered hit when I yelled at him for not cracking his window first. He winced as he blew a cloud of unmistakable marijuana out of his opening window. I cracked my window, took the lighter and took a large hit of the still green part of the bowl. Not bothering to corner at all I kept filling my lungs with thick smoke. I finish my hit handed the cherried bowl to Adin as I took deep a breath in as my lungs swelled. I held it in for 10 seconds staring at him and then released a massive plume of smoke from my window ""pussy..."" I say at the end of my breath.
Adin scoffs ""whatever, nice corner dude"".
""it was all for you"" I retort hitting my 2mg nicotine vape to quell the cough I have bruing in my throat. We get two more hits in each before we get to the window, money and goods are exchanged and coffee is obtained. [Every transaction could be a drug transaction if the laws were different], my very high brain wonders about this and tries to convey this idea to Adin. He is sucked into his coffee and pushing the last black bits of resin a burnt weed into the  bowl. After 2 lefts he hits it and coughs passing it, I choke on my hit and fight to focus while driving these two lane roads. We roll in to work late as usual, but the owner Travis wasn't here so today we didn't give a fuck.

I kept work shirts at the office, I mostly just took a new one every day from the boxes Travis hid from us. I took one and put it with my route of services in my truck, I never wore a work shirt under my warm clothes in the morning but  changed in the afternoon. I put on my bug killing baseball hat, that was probably as soaked in pesticides as the Wal-Mart brand boots I kept there too. As I got ready for my shitty cold day I looked around the office there was a small shitty futon where Lucas my other best friend was tying his boot, then Travis' office pleasantly empty, then the actual office. The office is where Adin and Val worked, he planned routes, she did reschedules, and most importantly both answered the phones. Adin and Val were the only reason I had not been fired. It was winter and after a hot, humid, and miserable summer the cold snap finally happened. It had snowed and the bugs all hid for the winter, pest control in the winter is really just putting out ant bait and looking busy. I hardly did any of my real job, I filled my pesticide tanks but never used it all in one day like I should have and drove recklessly in my little stick shift Ford work truck. But I got away with everything because of them. Everyone hated Travis for one reason or another and that bound us all. Together as the Vietcong of The Best pest control we sabotaged routes for rainy days, covered for one another's lateness or hangover, sharing weed, alcohol, and prescriptions all under Travis' nose. Today everyone was relaxed because everyone knew we would be alone. Adin and I were already high and had coffee for everyone. Lucas supplied us with an amazing little pill called Concerta, eagerly we took two each with our coffee. Val wasn't a fan of a lifestyle on uppers or stoned she sometimes would indulge with us, but more than anything she stuck to a crinkled plastic water bottle full of Malibu, Bacardi, or boxed wine. I come over to her desk and sneak a look in her bag, nestled next to her lunch was her water bottle ""nice..."" I think to myself. I talk to Val about whatever was going on with her or the next party she and Adin had planned in the house with my name on the lease. Val, Adin, Lucas, and I could talk for hours but at 8:00 a full hour after we showed up Nathan and I left for our routes and the office hummed to life with ""thank you for calling The Best how can I help you?"" and fake apologies.



The rush of dopamine, norepinephrine, nicotine, THC, CBD, and lots of caffeine, from my morning drug cocktail carried me far into the day. It was noon when I felt anxiety begin to creep in, I felt my frozen wet feet and the sticky sweat of working for 15 minutes in the cold and then getting in a warm car repeatedly. I hated this job the work wasn't difficult but the conditions sucked. In the summer it was hot, humid, long days that left your clothes soaked in a vile mix of sweat and pesticides. In the winter it was bitter cold, the rainwater and morning dew soaked your boots, and a cold wind cut through every layer of clothes and skin to chill your bones. At 2:00 I had just finished my route of spraying paralytics and other neurotoxins all around suckers homes. I was still sane, which was always a good sign, and at least I didn't have to explain that to get rid of ants you have to sweep regularly to an Indian woman today like Lucas did... 

As I came back to the office to drop off the truck, paperwork, boots and everything else I left there, I saw a dreaded scene. To everyone else it was a normal busines parking but, thanks to my habit of memorizing cars, I knew that a single little red compact car meant at least talking to Travis. So I  walk in with my headphones which was a poorly observed no no, but It  allowed me to ignore the unmistakable sound of Travis's ""Hey J"". As I put my things away and take my headphones out, I pretend to care about Travis's life and why he is here on his day off. After a few minutes that felt like an eternity Val looked at me while she was on the phone. Usually she would take pleasure seeing everyone else stuck in conversation with Travis, but today she was as peeved as I was about him showing up. To give herself and me a break she put a call on hold and yelled to Travis that he had a call, I give her a look of thanks. Travis picks up and I escape quickly to the office. I ask her about the usual bullshit happening today and leaned back in Adins chair until he came in and demanded his chair back. Before leaving I asked who was coming over though it never mattered. Our apartment was more or less a getaway house for our friends to escape to, we were never alone, but it was home.

Back home I shed like a snake from my door to my shower. Waiting on the water to get warm was always long enough for me to crush up a peice of Xanax, wrap it in a joint paper, and swallow it down. ""there goes my anxiety"" I say to myself as I find a half smoked bowl from Brookes morning routine. We would leave each other bits of drugs as notes that whispered ""I love you"" as we burnt and ate them. I pick up the blue bubbler, hit it twice and grab the only towel I own from the floor. One last rip from the bowl, I hold it in, and I slip into the showers warm embrace. Slowly exhaling through the smoke I whisper ""and there goes my sanity"". Where Is My Mind plays on my phone and the day rinses down the drain as my soul rises above...",1547577119.0

I got on suboxone to stop from going back to shooting fent daily. So I fucked up and got high I only used maybe 3 days I think. But pretty good amount in that time, maybe a gram. I’ve been having trouble trying to transition back into the subs. I waited a good 24 hrs took 4mg. No worse no better. Waited maybe an hour took another 4mg no better no worse. I don’t think I was getting sick from the fent because I was only doing it for 3 days. I was dependent on the subs.  But now its been over 48 hours. I’ve taken 12mg of sub today and still do not feel different. I’m not super sick or anything just lack of motivation, laying around you know minor stuff. Usually I dose the subs and bam back to normal can get up out of bed, work be motivated etc. just not working. Maybe it takes longer to work because the fent? Idk any thoughts would be helpful.

What you will need: decent or good kratom, hydroxyzine, lyrica(pregablin), Valium(kpin will work too),Cyclobenzaprine(flexeril) and turmeric and black pepper( preferably an extract, i use phinatural turmeric curcumin)

This is all best done a 2-3 hours after a high fat meal, the chance of throwing up on an empty stomach is too high.

Start off by taking the lyrica as it takes the longest to kick in then 30min after take the benzo. Wait until you begin feeling the effects then take the flexeril and the turmeric. After wait another 30min and take the hydroxyzine and wait for it to kick in. 

For the kratom I found its best to stagger your doses as it’s easier on the stomach and gives better effects. My usual dose is 15 grams here I took 35 so double your regular dose. Now take half the dose of kratom  and take the second dose just as it begins peaking. Not only will the greatly extend the duration but it will make the peak effects more intense.

With this combo I was able to nod and felt a super strong physical and mental euphoria and I had the effects last 4-6hours. 

Happy nods everyone

And redosing suboxone after small relapse,"Hey everyone. I’m new to the community. I wanted to share one of my stories, hopefully it will help others. It started with Ativan. I was prescribed 2mg of ativan for anxiety for my PTSD and my GAD(symptoms are uncontrollable sometimes) anyways I used Ativan for around a year on certain days. Went through the typical lay on the floor benzo withdrawl, 2 weeks later , all symptoms resided. 

This is where my doctor introduced me into promethazine/codeine for my bronchitis , and where I really started to like the feeling of opioids. During this stage I was prescribed clonazepam about 4 months later, never really sipped the lean every day, it was only a quarter pint at a time so it was like a day of fun not even, I’m an electrician, and I went to find a job , ironically I found a good job, except picked up an oxycodone addiction on the way. 

My boss was using at work and got me to try it and after I tried that first dose it was addiction hill from there...... so now here I was taking 1-3mg klonopin a day while getting more and more addicted to opiates. It got to a point where I would take them and fear that I wouldn’t wake up when i went to sleep at night. This addiction carried on for about a year. I thought I was trapped on benzos and opiates for the rest of my life. 

I’m the type of person that smoked weed here and there but could never see myself developing such an off path for my future. Anyways I was about a 9 months to a year into both addictions, and one day I got a chance to go to a remote location for 3 weeks. I took those three weeks and made a couple days notice before and stopped klonopin 3 days before the trip. I got to the trip in full benzo withdrawl. 

By week one the effects were so bad I was throwing up and couldn’t walk straight and my body was so sore I didn’t even want to continue. I wanted to give in so bad but something (not sure what, maybe my parents help) directed me off of the benzos and to continue getting off. 

By week 3 I felt as if I was going to need the hospital and that I would die from said withdrawls(cold turkey ) well I spent all of that time in the woods cabin at the remote location and withdraws slowly got better. (Would use oxy to cover some withdrawls of klonopin, not condoning that)By week 4 I was still withdrawling with the full body pain but it started to go away slowly. 

By month 4 of withdrawl I would say that the anxiety starts to fade but I could say I spent about 4-5 months of my life In a worried/panic/depressed state that I wouldn’t even wish on my worst enemy.  The withdrawl from the klonopin was so bad but the oxy helped me mask it. 

Now Ive been clean from benzos for 7 months and I never want to go back. But I have still been struggling with the oxy and go back and forth with suboxone. I want to be on suboxone but I’m stubborn and only take tiny strips that don’t do enough for me. Anyways I was doing oxy for a couple weeks (4 30mg) and I wanted to stop for good and went back on my subs, I took half of a 8mg sub. 

I felt great the first day right away after waiting 24 hours and I was good to go. Then I got the dumbest idea to take oxy and try to ween off a few pills to speed it up since sub is in your system so long and I wanted to be off everything completely. So I relapsed for one day with two 30mg oxys and was nervous to take my sub as normal after. 

I don’t see a lot of posts about people being on subs for a short duration and relapsing and wanting to get on subs after a short relapse . Anyways I took the half sub on a Saturday did nothing at all on Sunday on Monday I woke up and did a blue and did one at 4pm too and then today I woke up waited 19 hours and took suboxone(1/4 strip) but anyways I feel great! 

Once bupe/subs is introduced into your system I believe it is safe to redose suboxone  at any time after a small relapse(correct me if I’m wrong) but trying to get on subs without it being in my system already, I’ve had precipitated withdrawl after waiting 24 hours and today I’m good at 19 hours and did oxy yesterday. 

So to people on subs that relapsed do not be scared to get back on your subs. The worst is over and stay strong and stick to your regimen, subs are here to help and now in theory I know that precips will not happen if you already induced bupe within 4 days of relapse, if you guys have ever gone through anything similar I would really like to hear your story and I’m here for any advice.

I haven’t used opiates in about 3 weeks but the last time I did I scored 40 - 10/325 norcos and a few weeks before that about 20 10mg instant release oxy.

Will it be a waste for me? I got them for free so no biggie if it is.

But, man these meetings where so weird and uncomfortable they where either extremely hostile bitter and outright confrontational or so dark and depressing it would kind of remind me of scared straight more than anything and when anybody would get a turn to speak they would always talk almost disgusted like “I see people come and go and we’re always welcoming them back after they relapse we’ll im sick of that shit I’ve been clean for 2 years and when I fucked up everybody turned there back on me I had to pull myself up” or they would compare there addictions to other ppls “like when I was using I would use everything coke,crystal anything I could get my hands on that’s an addiction but when I hear kids talking about pills! pills?! If A doctor gives u something that’s not a drug that’s medicine I don’t wanna hear that shit” and opis being my thing it made me feel like maybe I shouldn’t even be there. one time a guy kept trying to talk out of turn and this other guy was telling him to shut the fuck up!

I allowed myself to continuously be fooled; fooled by my false belief that human beings are never born inherently bad, evil. When I was a boy I was taught that monsters weren’t real- no one told me of the monsters that man could become. And so, with the stab of a needle I became one of those monsters, and it would be a long time before I could claw my way back to being a man. 

I didn’t get to choose my confessions when I was out there shooting drugs;  instead like some sort of homeless fashion model I wore my confessions.  I dressed in track marks, dereliction, cynicism, and a voice of weakness. I was a perpetual victim. I wore those confessions, and I’ll tell you there ain’t a man alive who wore them with less pride than me. 

And that day it rained so hard, I still think about that day a year later. I saw that one couple I talked to my junkie Friends about til they were blue in the face, I saw em’ sitting outside the little French restaurant that I knew I could never afford. Their waiter had just dropped off the bill. And they play fought for that bill, and she smiled and he laughed and in the end she held it tightest. And then they kissed, and I’d swear to this day that the good Lord Himself timed that rain to  come down in buckets the second their lips touched and I tasted that rain- the same rain they tasted. And I just stood there, letting the rain wash away my confessions and wondering what it would be like to be her, to be him. What was that like, love? What’s it like to share a smile, share a poem, a laugh, a touch? What would that be like, to love, on a random Thursday in a God timed rain on a hot summer day in June?

See, when you’re a junkie like me you don’t get to choose your confessions.

\-Withdrawl seems SUPER mild from long term/high dose reports (its amazing to me, how a wonderful drug, provides so little... consequences.. when your going on 10+ years, the thought of long term benzo withdrawal, i can honestly say, outweigh benefits)

\-Doesn't pop on a drug test (maybe a dipstick but its 2019)

\-Seems like a solid fucking alternative to benzos

My bf and I just shot up, he took about 1/3 of a gram, which is close to his normal does at a time. After his shot he nodded a little and when he came to (within less than a minute) he was convinced I had passed out right after my shot (approximately a point, maybe a little more) which I am 110% sure I did not. I know without a doubt in my mind I did not pass out, nod, od or anything close. I did not even close my eyes! He told me he is 110% sure I passed out and he slapped me lightly across the face twice and then once harder which revived me, all while saying “please don’t OD!” over and over. Normally I would accept what he told me because in the past I have passed out and even overdosed a few times and he hit me with narcan, but like I said this time NOTHING came close to that, I barely even felt a rush. I asked him if it was possible that he imagined it or is mistaking it for another night. He said no, and that I just don’t remember because I passed out. 
What the fuck?! I don’t know what to think, is he losing his mind?! He clearly lost touch with reality for a little while. He’s fine now, but is sure the scenario played out the way he describes it. Can using heroin cause this? Should I be concerned about psychosis? We have agreed to stop using, and have been trying to quit. But this is really scaring the shit out of me!

(Posted this in r/drugs too)

My phone has been blowing the fuck up with all the various news outlets reporting on this.

Apparently, an opioid overdose is now the #1 cause of accidental death in America - statistically more likely to kill you than the chance of a car crash. 

Opioid OD odds: 1 out of 96 people 

Car crash odds: 1 out of 103 people

Stay safe out there, everyone!

I'm also looking for recommendations on how to REMAIN sober that has worked for you, enlighten me. I'm really searching  for some ex opiate addicts that got sober and have a positive success story for me to go off for some motivation, the statistics of people that got sober off opiates scare me and I want to know that is possible to refrain from usage and stay sober, so please chime in if you are out there.

Every time I think I am getting close to thinking I am going to cum it just doesn't happen. It sucks, because now when I am just chilling I sometimes start shaking a very very tiny amount because I know I need to cum and have so much built up in me but I just can't seem to do it.

Last year: £6000

I can't get over it.... I was saving for a mortgage (£18,000 in bank) and my job paid well but I've been laid off this year and I'm on half of what I was... I didn't feel so bad last year because I was working, saving money up and affording my habit but this year I'm already projecting by the end of this month I'll be £500 into my savings.... I'm applying for a weekend job to make up a bit of money and a few minor things on the side (the joys of not smoking weed) but still.... 

I'm sitting here thinking if I didn't have this addiction I'd be £7000+ closer to a mortgage (I'd have one by fall this year on a nice family sized house, my credit score is solid.

It's like... I've always been responsible with my spending and managed it responsibly...£7000 on Heroin. That's not counting the Oxycontin and Fentanyl I've had too. Oh the worst part is, I keep spilling my Heroin when I leave it on a sniffing tray. I'll get up to a fat line in the middle of my sleep or I'll pick the tray up and have a crazy arm jerk happen, poof, £400 stash gone. I've probably spilled more Heroin than lesser addict's have in a year.

The amount of money I've wasted on this drug. It's just hard to get over it, please someone else feel my pain....

And in the end after all the mental pain and mental gymnastics played to make myself be okay with how much I've wasted I have to admit... Heroin....what more is needed, happiness in powder.",1547486435.0

I've been on subs for like a year now after hitting rock bottom my life is wayyyy better than it was before, but sometimes I do feel a bit lonely because I burned so many bridges and lost so many of my best friends during those dark lost years of using...

Do you think AA could be a good place for me to meet people, and find the sense of community I'm looking for ??? My best friend goes to meetings sometimes when he visits the city from upstate (he used to live in the City), they're AA at a place called Midnite.

They have meetings every day multiple times a day/night and it's close to where I live and apparently a-lot of people who work in our industry go there..... No harm in trying right? I've never done any real meetings NA or AA, one of my DR.s had ""group"" once a month that was mandatory if you were on subs, but they were run by his wife because he and his family were super Christian.

I always thought NA made more sense, but a-lot of the NA meetings in NYC are in like homeless shelters and really shady areas and that doesn't really appeal to me or seem like a positive thing.

Basically a review of my experience so far for anyone curious or considering it,"TLDR - sorry for the damn wall o text!!! Basically I had a lot of really negative ideas about it for a long time and wanted to share a positive experience. 
Keep in mind I am still on methadone maintenance and cannot speak for the experience of tapering or getting off completely... This is me mid-treatment. Thanks :)

First of all, I think it's important to mention that I started out being of the very strong and strict opinion of methadone: fuck that, it's just a substitute, it's just government-funded heroin, etc. At the time, I knew only 2 ppl who had gone from heroin to methadone, and both were self-proclaimed ""lifers"" that continued to be swallowed by their addictions to other substances (particularly things that potentiated their methadone, causing their daily  doses to get them fucked the fuck off) despite leaving heroin behind.

My dad was one of them. He went to methadone after 20+ years of heroin use. We talked a lot over FB and I would tell him all about where I was at in life. I didn't need to sugarcoat things for him. He always ended up bringing up methadone, at first suggesting and over time almost trying to push it on me as a solution. I rejected it, so sure of myself that I wasn't as weak as him, that I would be able to find the peace in sobriety that he couldn't and some day be able to cold turkey kick and never look back. I kept trying, going in and out of state-funded detoxes, signing up for the 30 day programs but always bailing by or before my 2nd week. I would make the tiniest improvements, like getting a job, only to blow it all up in my own face and go on a remorse and self-loathing bender & wake up in a worse place than before. 
 
A little over a year ago, my dad's hardcore lifestyle caught up with him in a major way. His liver was failing and due to his status as an addict, he didn't qualify for a replacement. He wouldn't stop drinking no matter how much it hurt him or what the doctors said. He died in a hospital. I hadn't talked to him in months. I went to his memorial still strung out, around a family I hadn't associated with for as long as I could remember. 

After he died, I started to give the idea of methadone a chance. His death came as a surprise, despite how harshly he had lived. Even though we joked about needing to have a visit ""before one of us dies"", it was never a serious concern of mine. I faced the truth, that methadone may be my last resort, but I was down at that level already. The thought of my life flying past me like my father's had for him, ending in loneliness, regret, and pain was terrifying and now very real. I didn't formally decide to do it ""for him"", but my outlook softened at the thought of taking his advice and it saving me from the painful life he lead. 

Anyway, Heroin wasn't getting me high anymore, not any amount, and the meth/coke/crack/Xanax/whatever-the-fuck I did to fill that hole was tearing me up. My relationship, my health, my self-respect, the little respect anyone had for me... my life in general was deteriorating.  The selling point was when an aquaintance told me ""I can wake up in the morning and CHOOSE whether or not I want to use"". To me, that meant I'd be able to get high if I wanted, but the nightmare of withdrawal would no longer be a problem. So I worked for the money to do intake and pay for a weeks worth of doses, called the closest clinic and did the damn thing. I started at 30mgs.

I kept using daily for about a month and a half. I could still feel it on a lower dose. My boyfriend had not made the switch yet and knowing he was using was way too tempting. As I had been told, the daily dosing waved my sickness away and made me hella drowsy for a week or so. My boyfriend did his intake almost exactly a month after I had, after seeing my improvement as he still suffered. By my 3rd month, I was using maybe once a week or 2. This huge change was settling in on me, like a fog. It was like over time, the idea of shooting dope was becoming less and less appealing. So I would brush it off till I got a really bad craving, then I'd cop and the whole thing would be such a disastrous burden. I got a job on my 3rd month and naturally my paychecks were triggering as shit. But every time I'd give in, I ended up so disappointed that I truly never wanted to do it again...not ""fuck this, I'm kicking tomorrow!"", but ""I don't need this anymore, it doesn't help me, I can feel good without it."" The icing on the cake was my total inability to hit a vein anymore...after so long stabbing and bleeding and missing, only to receive the most dull ""rush"" imaginable IF I did succeed...it was horrible. 

As time has passed, my use has continued to diminish in frequency. I've leveled off at 60mgs per day and if I wanted it, I'd need a much bigger shot than I used to to feel even a little. My use went from daily, to weekly, to monthly, to only on the random occasion of a biting craving intertwined with depression or self loathing... For instance, recently I had an extremely traumatic & triggering life event. I bought a 60 of tar, from which I got no rush, but still woke up with my car stopped in the middle of traffic, and still have a huge painful early-stage abcess on my arm (right on top of my favorite tattoo). That experience was so overwhelmingly infuriating, it left me with only regret. I'm lucky as fuck I didn't go to jail. 

What I didn't expect from methadone that I have been so pleasantly surprised by, is the sense of freedom. Within the first week I felt like my cell door had been unlocked. Not having to wake up sick, or spend the first hour(s) of every day making myself hurt and bleed in search of a vein..no being cornered into trusting scary, violent, or creepy ppl, no putting myself the way of the law or danger out of desperation...

Im not as scared anymore, I don't feel the need to take shit from people or bend over backwards to prove to them that I'm worthy of their decency despite what I am. When I was using, I took the worst shit from people who claimed to care about me because I didn't think I was worthy of anything better. I'm so much more confident in my appearance since I've gone up to a normal weight and my body isn't constantly covered in scabs from picking.

Ppl I meet now would never guess all the fucked up places I've been...not that I'm ashamed of it, but it's nice to be able to choose whether or not I'm going to let someone know that part of my story. I'm learning things about myself I never knew and probably never would have known without the entire experience of addiction, and I can almost truthfully say that I don't regret it. One thing I am positive that I don't regret is my choice to try methadone. It hasn't been a miracle cure, and there never will be such a thing. Methadone helped me achieve more than I ever could have hoped it would, and I have no desire to stay on it forever...but I also have no desire to get off of it anytime soon, because I know I'm not ready. And that's fine. Methadone is by no means doing for me what heroin did & I don't want it to. All it's doing it helping me to take my recovery process at the pace I need to. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk :p

It damn broke my heart. My mom depends on those to live a normal life. And it was even a perc or oxy. Fucking belbuca films ???? So I guess the DEA is now saying you can’t prescribe maintenance drugs. Next thing you know they’re seizing subs.

I did Noticed that every time I took it in the morning even if I was extremely tired and miserable it would wake me up and make me feel awake, motivated and positive about my day. 

It almost made me think I got more work done. Its almost like what I would want an depression medication to do to me. It in no way made me feel high or anything like that which is good.  I guess what I’m asking is is there any over-the-counter vitamin or anything that has whatever the chemicals are in Oxycodone that make me feel that same Energy in the morning and positivity?

I'm trying to get off dope and I have 1 and a half subs (8mg strips) and 50g of kratom. I can also buy some adderall and more subs and potentially kpins. I'm wondering the best way to utilize all of these. Also I snorted a pack of dope today around 1-2:00 pm, could I take the sub tomorrow morning at around 6 or 7 am?

I was thinking about taking a full 8 mg strip tomorrow morning when I wake up for work, and shooting it. I should either be slightly sick or just a few hours away from sickness. Taking that sub should keep me good till the next morning where I want to take the half sub I have for 4 mgs which I assume will keep me well till the 3rd day. By the 3rd day I want to be off subs since I dont want to get off dope and be forced to take subs so for the 4th day I think id take 15 mg of kratom and a 30 mg adderall and continue that for 4 days by which point I think I'll be off sick.

I don't have a massive tolerance I uses to shoot up a gram and a half 2x a day but I stopped like 2 years ago I just relapsed 5 months ago but when it comes to regular ass opiates like codeine or hydrocodone I need a ridiculous strength to do anything to me (80mg or so) thank christ my tolerance for smack went down (I can get lifted on a half a point now!! Which is a godsend I don't have to spend half of the amount of money I did before to get high/well)


ANYWAYS I'm sorry for that long ass story my question is how does 30mg oxy (oral) compare to H or IV oxycodone? Would I need less or more by that logic I would say I get high off on 60mg of H (black tar given my geographical location)

I took around 10-20mg orally and didnt feel much after an hour, so I snorted under 5mg and felt it more but I wish I could do more but I'm worried, is it safe to redose so often?

Can I redose orally and or intranasally until desired effect? Let's say if I snort more every hour or so?

I've heard you can redose orally like this with DHC (Dihydrocodeine). Poping them whenever until desired effect. Is this true?

Of course I decided I wanted to get something since I had a shitty day. I've only known this plug a few months but we've become really close. I even have his extra phone number that only 3 or 4 people have. His girlfriend is young amd psycho jealous but we actually get along which he says is amazing since I'm his only female customer that she can stand. We talk from time to time as I have her number also. So I called him on xmas night around 9 and he told me to come to his hotel room but I'd have to wait for his plug but it wouldn't be long. Honestly I didnt care I was just sick of being alone and my son fell asleep and didn't want to be around my husband. When I called he seemed a bit upset and I asked him what was wrong. He was upset that this is his first xmas in 14 years out of prison and he spoiled his gf and always hooks everyone up and no one got him anything or even wished him a merry xmas. I'm a witch so I don't celebrate but I told him that I didn't get anything either and was alone all day. He was upset to find out I had been by myself and didnt call because he wouldve picked me up so I wasn't alone. On my way I had to stop at walgreens to get cash out and only had like $10 extra bucks so I got him one of the few remaining xmas cards($6!!!) And a bag of candy. I wrote him a nice and short note and was on my way. He answered the door and almost cried when he read the card. Most people just see their plugs as dope boys but I always have atleast 4 or 5 and always become close with them. Dont forget that they are people too! Well a couple nights ago he called me and told me he was stopping by. I was confused as he didnt have a reason to and said he was in a hurry. I came outside and jumped in the car and he was with his girlfriend. He said to look to my left and it was a wrapped gift. He got me a super nice puma zip up! I almost started crying. He said what I did meant so much to him and he's been meaning to return the favor but has been busy. The price tag said $60. Like damn. Kind of sad my dope man got my something and no one else did.

Only true survivalist can last long. Some people are better at than others. Of all the junkies ive encountered that were really good at it, the one thing they had in common is that they were willing to hustle. And they always had some kind of unconventional way of procuring their drugs.

So I was hoping we could have a thread where we can share our tricks and unconventional ways of getting our drugs or drug money. No need for obvious shit like stealing or wiggin up and slangin' that boyhole. That shits for the slowest of the herd.

Ill start....Dumpster Diving...yep. It can net you both money and drugs. Money by selling unused items you find thrown out. Drugs by unused drugs you find thrown out. Ill get a little more in depth.

I would always dumpster dive pharmacies. My state and city in particular has a lot of pill mill pharmacy that sell nothing but narcotics. Some of things ive found here are lots of broken pills that get thrown out. These are normally xanax bars and dillies. My biggest score to date im sure pissed someone off. 5 30ct bottles of dillies and a 500ct bottle of bars all unopened. Someone on the inside Definatly sent them out with the trash to retrieve later, but i got there first.
At big chain pharmacies my finds were often some hydrocodone cough syrup. But not normally any thing real good. 

Another thing to look for is always empty bottles of xanax. They come in 500 ct bottles. And they are kind of talcy. You often find a lot of loose powder at the bottom. 2 or 3 of those will get you fucked up.

Its some junkie shit to do for sure. This is only for a commited mfer who is gonna get high one way or the other.",1547417463.0

I want to quit it fully, but I’d like to know to what amount I will have to lower my intake to prevent or minimize potential withdrawel symptoms. 

It has been affecting my live (obviously) terribly, which has motivated me to follow this course

In just two days, I will be going into inpatient treatment by my own free will, for the first time, ever. This disease is so ugly, vile and terrifying. I live in fear every day that it might be my last, that I might nod off one minute and never wake up. It's soul-crushing, not just the haunting memories of what I have done to hurt those around me, but what may potentially await me in the future that could be out of my control. I'm tired of living in a constant panic of whether or not I'm going to not wake up one morning and leave my loving parents, my wonderful younger brother, my beautiful girlfriend, and my supportive, great friends to a life of heart-wrenching agony. The thought of having to potentially witness that horror beyond the afterlife aches my mind and soul to a magnitude of no other, so I've decided to finally take action in an attempt to put an end to it. I want to be able to live again, and feel happy without the weight of a substance bringing me down. I want to progress in life, and live to be the best me I can be. I want to grow old and be married with the precious, beautiful woman I've been lucky to call mine for the past year and a half. I want my family to be proud of me again, and to never have to worry about checking my pulse while I'm asleep at 4 AM. I want to be able to see a bottle of pills without instantly having the subconscious reflex to take it. I want all of this out of my life. Last night, I finished the last of an order of 26 blues, the ones that will hopefully be my last. If I'm being honest, I'm scared. I'm terrified of leaving behind what feels like my one and only true key to unconditional happiness and contentment in the world, the one thing that seems to prevent life from becoming dull and monotonous, but I know that's just the addiction speaking and I can only hope that it will get easier to deal with as time goes on. Any kind words of love and support are welcomed and appreciated to every extent. It will be difficult, probably the hardest thing I'll ever do. But I owe this to myself. I owe this to my family, and I owe this to every person in my life who has been there to love and support me. I'm hoping I will have the power to overcome this and never look back, through every fiber of my ability. I hope this message goes out to all of you that may be in a similar situation, I have every hope this will bring you some sense of empowerment or faith, and a sense of unity in not being alone.

Now I am wondering if I will feel wd or not because it's been already 3 days since my last dose and I just felt a little uncomfortable and like I am getting sick but that's it. I am probably overreacting because it has only been about 2 weeks of use but I wanna know what wd feels like and when it starts after the amount I took.

Some of you may recall I posted about a week ago regarding your all’s feedback about trying H for the first time due to my tolerance being so high and it being super expensive buying oxys all the time. Well here’s an update: I have taken your all’s advice and decided NOT to try H period. I also picked up 15 15mg oxys earlier today and my plan is to go through these (tapering myself down) and then going back to get the Vivitrol shot to stay off drugs for a while. This will be my 3rd time getting the shot and it ALWAYS works wonders for me. Planning on finishing what I have and then going for the shot once everything is out of my system for about 10 days. Thanks to this subreddit and to everyone that advised me not to go down that route! I love you all, wish me luck on this new journey! ❤️",1547370896.0

With that out of the way I need some honest opinions. I had a pretty bad oxy dependence in the past (roughly 80-120 mg daily) which i know to some of you is a minor habit but it was pretty life destroying for me. 

Well I’ve been clean for six months and I don’t ever want to use everyday or even every week/month for that matter. I know I have the willpower to stay clean because I have over 600 oxy 10/325’s in my possession and I’ve had them since day 1 of my sobriety and haven’t touched them once! 

If I use one time at like 30mg will this restart withdrawals or PAWS? Ideally I’d like to use every six months or so but if I’m gonna wake up the next day sick or wake up the next day with a horrible bout of PAWS then I may as well throw out all my oxy because it’s not worth it. 

To those of you who’ve kicked a habit and then chipped, what should I expect from the one time occasional use? What has been your guys experiences? ",1547368639.0

Anyways to keeps this short, after several attempts of getting clean and relapsing the past couple years, my urge to finally end all this bullshit is at the highest it’s ever been and I believe I must get clean this time and want to finally start living my fucking life again. My current tolerance is a gram a day of some really strong China White fent IV. 
 
So basically I’ve gotten successfully clean a couple times using rapid suboxone tapers the past couple years but this time I’m considering going cold turkey just to be done with all the bullshit seeing as you still have to w/d from subs still, as it only lengthens the w/d time while minimizing the symptoms, which is still awesome I think subs are an amazing tool for helping us addicts manage our lives and useful for getting clean completely. 

My arsenal of comfort meds include roughly 30 2mg Xanax bars, 35 300mg gabapentin, 4 grams of bud, random amounts of clonidine, methocarbamol, and hydroxyzine (all except the weed prescribed by my addiction doc). Also have a steady supply of old sub scripts incase I do decide to get on them. All of which I know I’m very blessed to have, as this is the first time I’ve gone through wd with such a nice amount of meds. 

So what do you guys think? Should I just use my meds to go cold turkey and tough it out for maybe 4-5 days until the withdrawals are over or just use the subs to withdraw somewhat more comfortably over the course of 10-14 days instead?  Any input is very much appreciated. Thank you all in advance, much love to my bropiates! 

TL/DR: Coming off a gram of china fent IV a day, should I use my generous amounts of comfort meds to just go cold turkey or just save the unnecessary hassle of extreme w/d pains by just doing a sub taper instead of just trying to get the wds over with.

He went through addiction, got off, and then started again over Christmas. His girlfriend was supposed to stay off of h too, but she went home for Christmas where the white is, and just lost it. So when she came back, he stopped using, and so did she. So we thought.  Neither of them have cars, and me and my d-boy are like family, so I would usually be the one to help with rides. I picked his girl up from work, and before I left he told me to not give her any of my dope. Okay cool no prob. I don't want to share anyways. But as soon as she got into my car, she hopped into my back seat and pulled out her own stash. She's a grown woman, she to make her own decisions. But I wasn't gonna tell my d-boy, that's between them. She was supposed to give me cash for all the rides and I just told her to give the cash straight to my dboy and him give me dope. The next day when I was working he called me asking why his girl called him saying that he owed me more than he gave me. He was literally yelling, wouldn't stop, so I finally said ""she asked me for a .20, and I told her no bc you only gave me a 30, so she wanted you to add to the bag so she could get some.""
Then he called later asking if I knew what happened to his money bag. No, I don't. He either lost it or someone grabbed it. Then I asked if I could stop by after work and he said yes. So I came to his apartment and he wasn't there but his roommates were so I bought off his roommates. When he finally came home, he was pissed. Screaming at the top of his lungs I was girlfriend asking her why she won't fucking stop heroin, told her she's just a junkie and she ain't worth anything, and then he saw me. Said I was a fucking stupid ass bitch, said he was gonna fuck me up (keep in mind I'm a female), and tried to come at me, and was just throwing out all kinda insults. I have no idea what I did. Fast forward to today at work. I opened my passenger door, and guess what was stuck between the seats? His money bag with 140 bucks. So that shit is mine, fuck him.

I think the dope was so weak but just good enough to stop any kind of sickness but nothing strong (most likely the blues were probably stronger, they had to be). So I did ZERO blues for like 3 months and just used the D. So I run out of D and of course start panicking that the withdrawals are gonna set in in due time. 4 days later and I feel totally fine. No withdrawals set in at all. My question is if this is even possible? Did I really taper myself off blues with weak D? Maybe I was just satisfying the sniffing cessation fix I have (I just have or had this obsession of sniffing things and feeling the drip). So to my fellow bropiaters, does this make sense at all? I had this panic/anxiety just waiting and waiting for the withdrawals to start but they just never did and today is day 5.

I detoxed in the back room of Carlos’s house. It was sweaty and miserable and sleepless. A slight pocking of my skin had started in California, but now it was taking a turn for the worse. It started on my arm where the witch bit me, and I swore it was a curse he put on me. The rash itched and robbed me of sleep. It tortured me. It broke my already feeble mind. My legs and ankles visibly swelled, and three different doctors had no answer. What I determined to be a secondary staph infection created crusty lesions on my thighs that broke and wept when I lifted anything heavy. A round of sulfa-based antibiotics gave me some relief, but even if the rash wasn’t there to plague my life, there were other things breaking me inside.

The abrupt discontinuation of my daily heroin regimen made me feel everything my body was doing. My bones’ hard surfaces cut into my aching muscles, pulling and twisting every ligament. Instead of a spine with vertebrae, I had a stack of wooden Jenga blocks ready to fall. My guts gurgled when I swallowed my saliva. I imagined my brain’s synaptic firings discharged heat through my ears and caused a dull aching in my eyeballs. It was as if life had become an electrically charged fence into which I was slowly being pushed. 

My feet shuffled across the floor in the daytime. Articles of clothing I collected from the streets covered Carlos’s back room in truly psychotic fashion. I spilled rolling tobacco all over his house and crept around the kitchen at night. His cupboard’s hinges creaked while his family slept. Solidified chunks from an ancient can of Ensure stuck between my teeth, and I gagged. It was my fault for compulsively looting his dry goods cabinet and eating whatever I found in the dark.

This has the desired effect and stops me from sleeping, I feel great euphoria and sets me up for an amazing and constructive morning. I am always so happy and buzzing as a result.

However, I always wake the following day with symptoms of a severe hangover (headache, fatigue, a general mess) which decrease in intensity across several days. 

I understand this could be due to Tramadol’s SSRI properties as I do not have this experience with Codeine, however the recreational value is of less favour to me.

Please could someone tell me whether this is normal? Also what I could take to counteract this “hangover”? I have Diazepam, Lorazepam, Clonazepam and Codeine but unsure if they would help ease the symptoms or prolong them

Thanks in advance ",1547343703.0
afecc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/afecc5/kicking_dope_with_oxy/,12,https://redd.it/afecc5,BlueWindows1,Kicking dope with Oxy,"Hi guys. I hope to get some advice. I’ve been using black tar for maybe 6 months max. I’ve never exceeded more then a half G a day. I’ve also never shot it, not even once, only ever plugged it. I transitioned to dope once I lost my oxy plug and the oxy’s we’re getting so expensive. Well I’m now broke and sick of being a slave to dope, and the quality is so inconsistent coupled with an unreliable dealer I feel like I’m withdrawing half the time anyway. I am ready to quit the dope as I’ve watched it mostly ruin my life, I’d still like to salvage what I have left. I have access to between 60-90 mg daily of oxy through a Rx my wife has. I am not ready to go cold turkey, but I’d like to eventually be opiate free, but I’d like to do it responsibly. I have a great job that I don’t want to lose plus a disabled wife and bills to pay so I’m in no position to go into rehab nor can I lose my job. I’m curious if any of you have transitioned from dope to oxy, any tips you might have or suggestions, what i should expect, and any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",1547343630.0

Sometimes I banged out reams of nonsense on my electric typewriter like a maniac firing a machine gun. Sometimes I decided that the world was ending and that I would die soon. There was no point in writing, then. Sometimes I stayed in bed and watched the squares of white sunlight slide slowly across the floor and up the wall until I couldn’t take it anymore and had to get up to figure something out. Sometimes I yelled at my dog from all the stress Tom caused me.

I forgot I had a dog, until now, but I probably wouldn’t have told you about him anyway. My career as a dog owner was a disgrace, and I thought if you hated me any more than you already do, you might stop reading. Not that my neglect of the old man two paragraphs before this one shouldn’t make you hate me enough to stop reading, but these days people seem to value animal life more than human. Let me tell you about my dog. He was a good dog.

It was Thad who brought him to my place after finding him in a parking lot some months earlier, and he was mostly heeler, what we called a New Mexican Cattle Dog. We named him Serio, in part because he seemed serious and in part because Sirius is the dog star. It fit well, and he understood me perfectly. He would leave at eight in the morning and return at night. He could sit, stay, lie down, get on the bed, get off the bed and anything else I asked him to do. He never went to the bathroom in the house except this time I screamed at him in my bedroom, and he pooped on my bed. It was clearly intentional and made me laugh because I deserved it.

When I moved from my old place to Tom’s, I overdosed on anxiety meds and left Serio outside of Smith’s grocery store. It took me several days to realize that he was missing, and when I did, an empty leash tied to the railing at Smith’s was the only thing I found. Serio showed up at Turtle Tom’s the next morning, even though he had never been there. It was an amazing feat and endeared me to him more than ever.

Now, I can’t remember if these last few paragraphs are about my dog or the electric typewriter my dad gave me. Either way, they were both destined for doom like everything else I cared about. My typewriter slid slowly off my bed even though I could have stopped it. I was too depressed to move. The impact shifted the keys, and it never worked again. Another local drug addict took Serio from me. Of course, he was better than I was and accused me of neglecting the dog but shot him for killing one of his chickens a week later. Such was my life and all that I touched.",1547342925.0

“Everything the warning labels on prescriptions say not to do is everything you want to do!” Tom laughed with his dentures out, like he was channeling my old friend Doh-Doh. With tears in his eyes, he told me of entertaining back when he was Turtle Tom Stone and made crowds swoon.  He told me that every time he died from an overdose and went to heaven some “Abe Lincoln looking mother f\*cker” sent him back saying he had to come in the front. That he couldn’t come in the back door.

Turtle said he once woke up in a refrigerated room under a sheet of plastic. His clothes sat in a bag on his feet and he had a toe tag. He got dressed and found dope hidden in his waistband. The whole hospital was frantically searching for his missing body, while he snorted drugs in a bathroom stall. His friends already had all his stuff and were squatting in his apartment when he walked up. A soothsayer in NY state had told him this was his last incarnation and that he was paying the price for the evil of his past lives.  These were the stories he told me.

One day he watched our friend’s girlfriend open his window and hang her belly over the sill before she slid onto the floor. The lights were off and she supposed he was gone, but Tom watched the whole thing from his bed a few feet away. She came for the flat screen. Tom slapped her in the head with his cane and used his walker to escort her to the front door. That was New Mexico when I knew it. Your friends robbed you and talked bad about you when it didn’t work out for them. Tom sent me to the bank to pull 40 bucks out of the ATM and get some cocaine one night, but I took $300 out of his account and never came back.

Everyone probably knows that after snorting its best to use a nasal cleaning spray or a nasal irrigation neti pot product to get the stuff out, but if you have any additional tips regarding nasal hygiene let us know in this thread.

&#x200B;

I personally came up with an idea that i think could be helpful in avoiding talc buildup in lungs aka pulmonary talcosis ( there is medical documentation of this happening to pill snorters)

&#x200B;

When youve crushed the oxycontin pill and made it into fine power; put a tiny bit of sterile water to your line and rub it around to make it more moist to eliminate the possibility of the talc getting airborn. Ive been doing this and personally i dont notice it affecting the potency. Simple but mandatory i believe. If someone has even better idea to combat this let me know.

Since then, I've struggled with relapses and short drug runs. My longest time ""clean"" since my 90 Days from November - February 2018 was 65 over summer.

**Today I can safely say I am legitimately 90 days clean.** 

I am also excited because I get to pick up a 90-day chip and I've never gotten that one before. From November - February 2018 - I white-knuckled it. So, I'm also excited about getting a 90-day chip. I'll likely pick it up tomorrow though. Even though it'd be neat to get it on the exact day, getting to a meeting today seems a bit difficult.

# Also, may I say a few words about Narcotics Anonymous?

***No? Okay, thanks, I will anyway...***

I used to shit on that program so much. I used to hate it and think everyone there was a delusional brainwashed religious nut job who took everything to the extreme. After getting involved in it, I discovered it is actually a super useful program that provided me with a new way of looking at life. I was stunned by how much fun the fellowship of NA is and am super lucky to have a strong fellowship where I live.

As for the religious side of NA here is a little summary of what NA really is when it comes to your higher power or religious beliefs: [https://i.imgur.com/5V6xKnJ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5V6xKnJ.jpg)

For instance, for me, my ""higher power"" is this concept that you get back what you put out into the world. If you put a lot of good in - you'll ultimately get good back. I take negative experiences as, ""not as bad as I think they are"" and ""a learning experience,"" it really helps me cope with day to day life and so much higher power is simply the idea that I am not in control of what happens, but I am capable of making good & healthy decisions.

# 90 days is a lot but at the same time, it isn't!

Let's see, in the last 90 days, my life has changed dramatically...

* I got Engaged
* I moved into a larger 1 Bedroom for cheaper than my studio! Say WAT?!
* I've gained a lot of my Family's trust back in me
* My average number of ER visits is rapidly on the decline
* I'm learning alternative measures to my pain problems
* I'm starting my own website/online business entity
* I finished Step #1 & admitted to being an addict
* & I bought a whole bunch of nice furniture for my new place, because I could afford i

That's a lot of chance imho for 90 days! 

Anyway, yea that's what's up. I am living my best life - CLEAN!",1547334126.0

Coming off a 2 bun a day habit, (2 grams of ecp daily) I figured 24 hours was enough time to wait. I was feeling mild withdrawal at that point, but I figured 24 hours was enough. I split the suboxone strip into 4 2mg pieces, and used one.

45m later, I was launched into Precipitated WithDrawal HELL.

I started kicking uncontrollably. Yawning about 2 times a minute. My eyes were HUGE, and they were runny as hell. Hot water tears were pouring out of my eyes. My stomach started cramping. Chills. Everything. The worst withdrawal ever x 100,000.

My H dealer wasn’t around until Sunday, so from 4 pm Saturday up until 12 pm Sunday, I was in legit hell. I wanted to kill myself, that’s how bad it was. I didn’t sleep a lick all night, just kicked, yawned, and screamed from time to time. It was insanity.

I rolled out of bed and drove to my dealer, hadn’t showered, hair a mess, still in my pajamas, smelling like shit. I didn’t care. I couldn’t do anything and I was on the brink of suicide (not really, but it was bad. BAD.)

I finally got the H in my hands, nose runny and everything and furiously opened the bags and snorted a bunch. Within 2 minutes, I fucking started vomiting. 3 times, all over my passenger seat car. I started sweating like crazy too and basically. Started fucking crying. 10 minutes later, I started feeling better and within an hour and a bunch more bags I was basically ok.

What the fuck? How can I ever get off this drug if that’s what happens when I stop or try to use suboxone? I couldn’t wait more than 24 hours, I was feeling anxiety and like shit so I used it and it almost killed me. I was so scared of withdrawal on Sunday that I made sure I used every day this week up until now.

I scored a bunch of Tylenol #3’s and Kratom. I’m planning to use clonidine, Kratom and the codeine tablets to detox. I researched but didn’t find anything about using codeine to taper off H. Does anyone have any experience with this? Do you think it’s a good combo?

I guess the point of this post is to ask about the Tylenol #3 detox idea and to warn everyone about PWD. Don’t fucking do it. If I had a gun, I might have offed myself. It was that bad. I kept kicking my legs all night and just couldn’t stop. I screamed at the top of my lungs a bunch of times because of how bad it felt. Lesson learned. I’m never touching suboxone ever ever ever again, and if I do, it’s damn sure going to be 48-72 hours after my last use.",1547321991.0

So I go on binges that last anywhere from 3-6 months, I build quite a tolerance... then I somehow manage to stop..I do remember that every time I returned my tolerance was always decreased. But I just can’t for the life of me remember the exact specifics

For example, my most recent binge started August of 2018 and ended January 3 2019.

First day, It took me just 50 mg of Hydrocodone to nod. Last day it had climbed to 100 mg oxy..


Before that, my last binge was January 2017 and I was at 100 mg oxy... so a year and a half break dropped my tolerance to 50 mg hydrocodone (or one blue 30 approx)


Fast forward to now, my tolerance is at 100 mg Oxycodone  yet again  But I am not planning on quitting for a year and a half like last time...

I’m only gna stop for 3 months. So when I do return from this 3 month break, how much would be a safe dose ? 100 mg would be overkill, right ? 

I’m guessing 45 mg would be ideal? What do y’all think.

I can clearly see he's fucking up and putting Opana 40s in my Bottle ($120 each) instead of suboxone... I was like oh my god.. I said thanks and got the fuck outta there. I got down the street and turned around to return them because I genuinely like this guy, but the junkie in me just couldn't force myself to make the turn onto his street..

&#x200B;

Now im just sitting here with 7 Opana 40s waiting on his text saying bring my motherfucking pills back.. Nothing yet.. It's been about 30mins.. I don't know what to do. I haven't done any yet.. What would you do? fml I hate him putting me in this position.

Update 4 those interested: 

24 hours later nothing..
Shortly after I posted on Reddit yesterday I decided to take a road trip and I drove a couple hours to visit my mom and my dog because I rarely have enough pills to last me long enough to have an enjoyable visit. Every time I go to visit her I'm rushing out the next morning sick af with a wad of cash going a hundred miles an hour back to my city to the dope man..

Haven't heard a peep from him or any of his little junky girlfriends who make every bit of his pills and his money their business... they try to use him  but he's an old white man,pussy Slayer type from way back... type of old white man you can't kill.   smoking crack riding Harleys getting shot catering around buckham $30,000 cash dealing with black thugs that's just in the last couple of months this old motherfukers done all that..  he knows exactly what he's doing  definitely  the Patriarchs of  our City's dope scene ..
His silence is almost more disconcerting than being cussed out. I'm going to try to buy more pills today like nothing happened but I'm kind of nervous to even talk to him.",1547321380.0

The start of the spiral that wound me up a homeless h addict,"She was lying to me. Bold faced. She knew it and I knew it, even her mom's little yappy fucking dog knew it. What the dog didnt know was the rules of engagement in the war of lies our relationship had become. I couldn't just call her out without proof. Overwhelming evidence really, but I was ready. Or so i thought.

""You're using again."" I said plainly and without emotion.

""No I am really really not."" She replied a little too quickly.

""I found a rig in the car, your arms have tracks and you're pupils are pinned. Dont lie to me. I can handle it if you've relapsed but I cant handle being lied to by my significant other. As someone who was shooting dope long before you ate your first lortab I know the signs. I have never once been angry or even disappointed in someone to hear they're off the wagon. It's as regular a part of life to me as someone saying they have a headache or something."" I said honestly. I didnt want to fight about it. Truthfully a big part of me just wanted her to admit it and break me out a damn shot also. 

She continued to lie but I knew it was bullshit. I should have let it go and and acted like stuff was cool and made plans to leave and followed through on them but I was younger and dumber then and I let being right get to my head without thinking of consequences. A mistake I've made over and over in my life.

""Fine. If you aren't using then take this and never let me hear the end of how right you are."" I said as I pulled out a suboxone she didnt know I got at the methadone clinic that morning. I was on 180 fucking mg of methadone a day. It would've been a much better position to throw that in my face rather than deny use in my opinion. 

"" . . . . . . .""
"" . . . . . . . I""
"" . .I am not fucking using and I dont want that fucking sub! Why cant you trust me?!"" She said, along with blah blah blah more of the same. Then she said she was taking the kids (hers not mine but I'd been their father figure for over 5 years) to an appointment to have their pictures made. She wasnt even angry. Said she loved me very much and we could talk more when she got back and asked if I needed anything while she was out. That was a pro move. I was outclassed. About 25 minutes later the police arrived for me. 

Her mom knew I'd been selling some shit. I thought that had something to do with it. I had been being pretty good though. I didnt know my fiance completely betrayed me. She was not a good person to have turn against you because she couldn't just stab someone in the back a little, ever so gently and mercifully. She would go all out and try to destroy someone 100% so you couldn't come back at her. That reptilian mercilessness is still somewhat impressive to me. I dont have it. 

It was Friday. I had Saturday and Sundays take home doses of my methadone. I took them both while I watched the police walking up to the door from our bedroom on the second floor. I thought to myself ""360mg on top of the 180 I had a few hours ago might be a deadly mistake."" then I thought ""you'll be extra high in holding in the jail and if you die it really wouldn't be too tragic. Nothing of value lost really."" I know that's a fucked way of thinking and I've climbed out of it since but I felt that way for many years. I proceeded to make sure the very little illegal shit I had was well hidden and proceeded to face the music. 



Pt 2 coming later. Maybe. 

How has everyone's holidays been? I haven't posted any stories lately so I thought I'd throw one out there. This was waay back when I was on methadone (obviously) sorry if it's not as crazy as my normal posts if that's what you're into. I've been trying to work on things so I didnt want to post stories about my homeless gutter junkie street rat life because I'm not in that mode right now. Thankfully. My best friend, explaining this to another girl I know on video chat with me said ""oh yea he gets clean for short periods ever so often"" so dont be horrified if I'm back on the streets getting high again but I'm currently trying not to with the help of a really good friend. I have even left my home state and moved somewhere new. Ty to all the people who have messaged me and have shown concern and positive energy. You guys help more than you know.

Now he is blowing me up asking for some opana. He’s saying if I don’t help him he’s gonna get high somehow. He is determined to and I know he can elsewhere if he wants.

1. Is there a difference between OxyContin and Oxycodone (or is OxyContin just a brand name of a type of Oxycodone?), additionally the same question about Roxicodone.
1. How does Dilaudid compare to Oxycodone mg to mg? Does an 8mg Dilaudid have the same/similar high to a 20mg or 30mg Oxycodone?
1. I remember a long time ago when I would smoke OxyContin pills I would have to wash off the coating with a damp paper towel, if I plan to snort these pills do I need to do anything special with them like I did for smoking them?
1. Do people really stuff things up their bum? No judgement, just hard to tell if it's hilarious sarcasm or people are really getting high this route, also is there a benefit/downside?
1. Lastly the big question; I recently came into a mixed plethora of pills (~200) of 10's, 15's, 20's, 30's, 40's, 60's, 80's of OxyContin/Oxycodone/Roxicodone (again not sure the differences) as well as 4mg/8mg Dilaudid. More than half of them are 30's and 40's though. My main question being, what is the best way to consume these that does not consist of using needles? My preferred method is snorting as well so any tips/advice on that route is appreciated.",1547308287.0

I smoke BTH. I chose it as my DOC and am an open opiate user using once per month. My history of opiate drugs includes Heroin, Oxycodone, Buprenorphine, Hydrocodone, Morphine and even Opium. I am not opposed to IV use. I know how to IV and have the necessary gear and am a stickler when it comes to hygiene, technique and moderating personal use.

My tolerance is always ""Opiate Naive"" whenever I use. Before going with the BTH, 15mg Oxycodone insuffulated would have me feeling nicely euphoric and content. No where near nodding though and let alone rushing. Just happy and high.

My questions are now as follows:

1. Recommended dose. I believe for me IV 1-4mg. I have read a few occasions of the rush being so intense that it was mentioned they felt as if they've OD'ed while being consciously aware and in a state of extreme euphoria after the initial rush that triggered this feeling. That sounds really good. IV Dope came close to doing this a few times but those thoughts subsided within seconds. Is it more intense than that?

2. Could this overthrow BTH as my DOC? Or is it an exotic indulgence that won't replace the tried and true? I've been fetishizing Hydromorphone for a few months now and would be quite disappointed if it let's me down.

3. How does a Oxy/Dilly combo sound? Many refer to it as yet another hillbilly heroin variation. I am not a fan of combining drugs. The reason why I suggested it is because I am worried that while the rush will tickle an old fancy of mine, the short legs will leave me feeling unsatisfied.

Sorry for writing so much blah blah, I'm just excited to try this new substance and haven't had an IV rush in a long time.",1547295725.0

For everyone who has got clean off opiates and comes across the thought of just having one night to bring back old memories and have a good times thinking your strong enough to just do it once more, you are not. You may think one time after being sober for months or years wont put you back into active addiction you are dead wrong. Opiates are so much stronger than how strong minded you think you are about being able to just do it once and stop again and that is a fact.

The reason I say this is I have been using for 8 years... April 2016 I got pulled over for driving under suspension and ended up not paying my ticket since I rather get high and finally got picked up on a bench warrant. Since it was my first time I ended up doing 30 days in county which I got sober and needed nothing which was nice for once. Unfortunately 30 days didnt do it for me and the night I got released I was at the connects getting high again and it went back to every day again.

May 2017 once again I ended up getting pulled over for driving under suspension, no insurance etc. which racked up tickets to an amount over $2000. From my addiction I had lost everything from the time I got released from jail the first time and once again had no way of paying my tickets due to chasing the high. I ended up going to court and got sentenced to 90 days. Out of the 90 days I believe I served 64-66 days total and in that time I got completely sober again. 

After that 64-66 days I felt the best I had ever felt within the past 8 years from addiction. When I was released I had it in my mind that i wasn't going to pick it up again and fall back off into addiction. All I did when I got out was smoke a little weed until about 3 weeks after release (almost 3 months clean). 

After 3 months of being clean my fiancee who slowed down but never really stopped like promised since I was getting clean in jail asked if we could buy just 1 yes just 1 Roxy 20mg so I said yes but only this one since I felt like I wasn't weak minded anymore and I could just do 1. My tolerance had dropped in the 3 months and after I smoked half of the 20mg Roxy within 30 minutes ended up having a seizure waking up with EMS around me.

Even after coming close to fucking myself up for the rest of my life or worse dying this didnt stop me. I thought I was still strong minded after this and that hey 1-2 on pay day once a month wouldnt hurt anything and wouldn't put me back to square one. That half of a 20mg Roxy started the addiction again and one turned into 1-2 once a month which turned into every payday that turned into back to being in active addiction once again doing them every day and always hunting for something so that I won't be sick when I wake up, during the day, or at night when im calling it a night.

At this point I guess a may be a little better off or maybe the same... 2016 and 2017 I had a vehicle but was living in hotels since I couldn't save money to rent a home. Now once in active addiction again its completely opposite. I had saved enough while starting into active addiction again that I was able to rent my own home again but now I don't have a vehicle. Had some problems come up and the vehicle my fiancee and myself screwes up and after paying my bills and getting our fix every day we do not have money to get another car. We have been without a car since mid October and have been waiting on tax season to get a reliable vehicle again.

I am sorry this was so long but I just spent over 30 minutes writing this in hopes of if anything just saving one of you from going back into active addiction after spending all that time getting clean and healthy and reprogramming your brain into being a normal person again after you spent countless hours that turned into months or years chasing the high, screwing up relationships with your family, taking away your freedom for periods of time, fucking up your body to points it can't be reversed or worse death... 

Please for those who are sober stay sober and don't think that your mind is stronger than the opiates because the fact is if you are even thinking about doing it one more time and you will be able to say ""hey ok that's it for me"" then your mentally not strong enough. You will know when you are mentally strong enough when you get offered that substance and you decline or the thought of doing them again never crosses your mind again.

If this post saves just 1 redditor from relapsing then this post was a complete success in my eyes... I hope it saves more than just 1 person but as an addict I know it takes one baby step at a time.",1547285330.0

tldr; tried to kill myself by snorting a bag of H laced with fentanyl being a opiate naive

I've been depressed for over 5 years and had several attemps to kill myself (tons of xanax and alcohol) but this time I was so sure I was going to die from OD wave from fentanyl. I bought a fent strip test over the internet, asked my guy for some H, he didn't have but he know someone who had it, after 2 days he came throught and handle me a small bag of ""China White"" and said it was the most stronger shit he have ever seen, after that I went to multiples pharmacys to buy a needle but they all refuse to sell it to me (even went to buy with a d.a.r.e. shirt) so fuck it, im going to snort the whole bag, being a person wjo never did any opiates this should kill me. I opened the bag and tested for fentanyl and was a positive, I felt so fucking happy because I was sure I was going to die, after I snorted the whole bag I went to smoke my last cig and... I woke up with my brother in law carrying me to the couch, I snorted at 2:30AM and he found me 7:30AM, he said my lips were blue and I was so cold (I live in south florida and was the coldest night of the season, was 41°f) He covered me with some blankets and I fell asleep again, I woke up multiples times and threw up a LOT, when was 4PM I was fully awake and my sister asked me what happend and I said I bought some coke from a guy and don't know what happened. Now my family thinks im a dumb Coke head and not a suicidal person.

This will be a bit of an extreme rant and some of you may not agree and that is completely fine but the way I see things is that the posts, that usually go along the lines of “I found .... what is this? Is ... a junkie?” need to desperately stop. If you have a hunch about someone using there is no better option imo than to ask them nicely. At the end of the day none of us here can identify anything with completely certainty. And if you are to go off our opinions and thoughts (because that is what they just are) I do not see how it will end anyway but badly. 

Particularly to all you parents and partners of potential users, you need to understand there is a way to approach someone about this. We don’t know who you are and anyone else in your life and we sure as fuck don’t know your situation and story. Remember that a person will only accept help when they want it and they will only stop using when they are ready to. Any forceful approach, in my experience, only led me to disappearing for weeks and using with a ‘fuck it’ mentality that led me to the ER room countless times. 

I’m sorry but I personally can not stand these stupid fucking posts. We addicts are typically sensitive and temperamental people that think and act very differently to non-addicts, especially those of us who are criminally minded by nature too. So please keep that shit out of here because it honestly serves no positive purpose at all. We don’t hold all the answers in the world. All I, or anyone can do for this matter, is speak on my own experiences and opinions. I know for a fact that if majority of you who post these things approached me they way I have seen you do/say things it would not go pretty. Especially if it was about something like fucking grain of sand on the floor behind the bed or some random plastic. 

Anyway do as you please rant over. Just at least be very careful, calm and understanding and at the end of it HELPFUL. An interrogation, lecture or demands is gonna get you no where fast.

Never thought I would be able to say that.,"Deleted my old account I use to use here awhile back. January 10th last year I had my bond revoked while out on house arrest. I had so many warrants in other counties, violated probation in 2 counties, my kids were in dcf custody, my wife and I were in an extended stay motel, I had no job, and basically everything had turned to shit. 

So January 10th I got high as hell for the last time and turned myself in. I did 30 days in jail followed by 90 days in a work release type program. That was what really helped me get on my feet. I got a job and got into a program to get certified to work as a welder. I got out in April and right after that was put on 90 days house arrest for the probation violation in another county. 

I kept trucking and just fought all the urges I had to use. Which seemed like a lot for the first 6 months. In August my wife and I became a home owner and the following month got custody of our boys back. I’ve been working as a welder for awhile now and my wife recently got a new job working in HR for the first time. 

It’s strange having money in the bank, doing things as a family, and not having to look over my shoulder worrying when I’m going to get taken in on my warrants. For so long it seemed like there was no end in sight and I was just waiting to overdose. It’s been a long road and after so many attempts and relapses I really feel like I’ve made it. I have 6 days left on probation and that’s it. All my legal problems are behind me. 

I gotta say though what made it different this time was both my wife and I were so ready to get clean and get our life back after so many years ruining it. We actually wanted it. I still read this sub every day for motivation to stay clean. I love seeing all the posts of people here posting how long they have been clean and all the advice people have for those attempting to get clean. Love you guys!

Water and a high fiber diet. This is best in the long run, but it takes time. Also this is the safest and may push you to kicking for good. 

Gentle laxatives like Metamucil and Exlax. This is second best and safe, but it does not always work and relief is not immediate. 

Harsh laxatives like FLEET and magnesium citrate.  These must only be used infrequently since they are not 100% safe but they work in minutes. The purge is violent but the relief is worth. 

WDs.  I promise you that WDs WILL CLEAN YOU OUT.  You'll also save money, but the sickness is... well you know.  Again the sickness may push you to kicking for good.

So I worked till about 12am with a buddy we got a few bags of ecp sniffed while working I was fine, seemed clean no fetty, Just a little fucked up, no nods or anything just felt decent. I got home took 1mg Xanax and sniffed one more small line. Was watching tv for about an hour. Then had to pee. Now when I do D it takes me forever to piss. So I sat on the toilet pushing on my stomach, and the wall is very close to the toilet, like in front of your face. So I leaned my head against it while pushing on bladder to pee. Well I eventually fell asleep. I woke up, legs obv pins and needles, numb, and toenails especially on left side turned purple but I was on the toilet so the position cut off circulation. I then realized the time being 645am and found out I was sleeping on the toilet for about 4 hours give or take 30 min. My face and lips had color some pins and needles in arms and hands but like I said the position I was in wouldn’t be very comfortable while awake. I think my limbs fell asleep from the position, but at the same time a bit scared I was close to an OD but again I felt fine before going to bathroom. And was atleast an hour since I dosed last before I went to toilet. Could this have been an OD or just fell asleep. Also another important fact, I worked very late last night as well got like 2 hours sleep max and getting a bit sick (like a cold not dope sick) so when I got home tonight I fell asleep for an hour as soon as I sat down before I even showered or took that last small dose with the Xanax. So being so tired is why I think I fell asleep on toilet but very well may have been close to an OD, but again just think was the weird position I fell asleep in. My face had color and lips were red just my toenails purple but again if you think of the position I was in that makes sense. Just scared me a bit and wondering your guys thoughts. I’m quite new to D but have a decently high tolerance to oxy, about 120mg to feel decent. And I dosed tonight just a couple lines through the night and again never got too fucked up. No nods, just actually tired due to lack of sleep the night before. Wondering what you guys think. I also have a natural tolerance to Xanax, I can take 6 Mgs by itself and does nothing, might knock me out eventually but nothing much else, but every time I mix .5-1mg with say 100mg oxy i normally  end up falling asleep if I’m not up and moving around. Thanks guys just a scare on my part since I’m a bit new to D, I also took more D last night with that same 1mg and was fine.

Basically you would inject lots of heroin, and after a while use a syringe to take your blood back out, not too much but about a small cup full of it and store it in the freezer until the WD kicks in and then use that blood which has heroin in it and inject it back into your body.. I mean I don't think it would be bad because its your own blood so there can't be any infections. I guess the high wont be as good but better than nothing ay?

Not wanting to be sick to work tomorrow, I hit him up again and said I’d be willing to uber to where he was at.

Hi opi fam, I need to get something off my chest and you guys have always been great support so here it is. 

I went to rehab for 45 days. Got out was going to 12 step meetings the entire time. Didn’t really buy into it at all but hey it was past an hour of time of me not using. I use to have a really bad cocaine problem like every day from morning to bed and was popping oxys and Xans. Then my fiancé who was my first love in high school (high school sweet hearts) dropped the hammer enough is enough I’m leaving. That was enough to get me to quit. Two years later got in terrible wreck fractured spine knee surgery whole nine yards. Was getting so much oxy that got out of control by the end of that year. Oxys were too expensive when my script was over so along cake heroin. Was doing iv speedballs every day. In November last year I didn’t go to family thanksgiving. (They know I use but not like how much I was using). They called me didn’t answer for two-three days which is rare for me. I lost my phone and didn’t care to tell them as I was shooting all day long. They thought I died or was missing so police got involved I figured all this out and admitted I had a big problem. Rehab was great but cravings like mother fucker. My plug who I’m close with had some A1 coke and of course I indulged the past two days. No heroin as I’m on suboxone. 

Here’s my question. (Sorry for all the previous ramble but I felt like I should give you guys a minor background story, now on the question). 
How do you guys that are sober I know there are some in here. Handle a relapse? 
In rehab they told me to be honest and if you relapse you can go back for 30 days again. 
I feel like that’s a money making scheme. So what have you guys done when you relapsed?",1547187845.0

Here is the issue:

All are expired as of 01/2018. Pharmaceuticals are usually good way past their expiration date so I'm not too worried about that

The main issue is the ones that have been opened. They were not protected very well from exposure to air. Do you think they've degraded or become less effective?

Since I’ve been sober for the past two months, I’ve been talking to her more just to try to support her and really, to show her how nice it is to be sober. I’ve been trying to support her, we hung out last week and I sparked her up on a blunt, that type of thing. So since I have no Zubsolv and I’m going to a concert with my mom this Saturday and I don’t want to be withdrawaling for it, I asked my girl, ‘I’, we’ll call her, if she could give me a few of her Suboxone so I could make it. 

Well holy fucking shit. I’m not going to say it was like pulling teeth, but I had and have to essentially beg this bitch to let me get some. It’s not like she’s saying no and stuff, but it’s the type of thing where she’s asking me for money and shit for some. Thing that y’all should know is that *obviously* she doesn’t take them. Maybe one a week if she feels like it. 

Don’t get me wrong, I know it’s my fault for misplacing mine, and I’m NOT trying to act as though I am *entitled to her medication*. But hopefully some of you guys understand where I’m coming from. So I just had to ask my dad for $5 so I can give it to her tomorrow for 2 fucking films. 

The reason why I’m like this is because A- Like I said she doesn’t even take them, and B- Last time we chilled I sparked her on a fat blunt and shit. Not to mention before I knew that she was prescribed Suboxone, I had offered her some of my Zubsolv if she ever needed. It’s like come fucking on... I 200% understand, know, and have experienced heroin addiction, y’all know that, I mean go look at my post history. But for fucks sake— something you don’t need nor take and you’re like holding onto it for dear life? I have to beg you for 2 fucking strips? Go fuck yourself. 

I always said that I would support her, considering when I was at her house she was going back and forth whether or not she wants to be sober, and I know she doesn’t. Plus again I know how it is. But it’s getting to the point where I can and WILL love you from an arm’s length. 

Idk, I just wanted to vent and get your guys’ opinions. What do y’all think about the scenario??

EDIT: What IS a friend’s responsibility then guys?! Is “making sure a friend is okay” not one?! Cause if not, I’ve been being a friend ALLLL WRONG ",1547170076.0

I've lurked on this sub for a while but I've never posted. I apologize first off for the wall of text- I'm trying to convey the whole story succinctly. Just got off the phone with my Dr's office and felt the need to post here just to get something off my chest. In 2015 I tried heroin for the first time and within a few months I was a full blown addict. I got clean May 17, 2018, but for the first few months of being off drugs I fell into what a lot of addicts do, which is that I was drinking quite heavily for a bit there. I've always enjoyed drinking and have at least a glass a wine r 2 pretty much every evening, but I haven't been drinking as heavily at all as I was at the beginning of me being clean off dope (when I briefly was drinking in the mornings sometimes just to get that ritual of feeling inebriated like when I was using). Last week, I  went to the doctor for a physical for the first time in almost 8 years (longish story but no health insurance plus I'm relatively young) and they drew blood and did other tests. Well, the office just called and asked for me to come in again this Monday because the doctor was concerned with something having to do with my liver, and they told me not to drink any alcohol at all between now and my appointment. I'm so nervous,  y'all. My mom passed away when she was 45 to breast cancer and my father also died fairly young (50, he committed suicide) and I've always  been so fearful of the same fate. I've only recently started to get my life back together (got accepted to a really good college,  doing lots of self improvement things like yoga and reading and meditation and whatnot) and I really don't feel like I have anyone to turn to right now in my moment of insecurity and uncertainty. I just wanted to share that with this community and ask if anyone has similar stories or can offer any advice. Thank you guys",1547161081.0

None of my IRL dealers were into the downer opiate scene much, nor would they enable me if they were. But finally my cavities and teeth caught up to my reckless treatment of them, neglecting to brush most days and  eating hella chocolate bars. Now usually when going to the dentist they'd fill in a cavity or three, with nothing more than novocain and sent me on my way, not even nitrous. However this time it was a cavity they'd already tried filling in and it got so close to the nerve that a root canal was warranted. And yup, eight 7.5/325s prescribed and a $200 bill. I knew my low-key scheme would eventually work! Couldn't stop myself from taking less than three per day, but was able to cut myself off after that. Those two days were so pleasant, and yeah I'm sure those of y'all with a tolerance must be pretty jealous I could get off on so little.

My habit wasn’t too bad this time, so WD’s weren’t gonna be anything out of this world. So a couple hours after doing my last dose, I wanted to get a good night sleep (as much as I could before sleep was hard to come by), so I decided to take half a leftover Seroquel I had from rehab. As I’m drifting off to sleep, I suddenly start feeling that creeping feeling of WD’s coming on. I think to myself “damn, that last shit I got must have been garbage with no legs,” but then it starts rising really rapidly, and before I know it, my body is literally ICE cold, I have the most intense feeling of dread and panic, burning in my chest, the whole fun shebang. That’s when it dawns on me... I suddenly remember my naltrexone pills looked exactly like my Seroquel pills. My heart literally sank, and I started panicking the fuck out. Ran to the bathroom and forced myself to throw up, hoping the entire pill hadn’t dissolved (it had). I kept asking myself how long is this feeling gonna last? What if it gets worse as more of the pill gets absorbed. I had never taken naltrexone before, and all I could think of at the time was how sub PWD’s can last days (I was too freaked out to remember that PWD’s from subs last really long from their long half-lives, and maybe PWD from naltrexone doesn’t last as long). It was fuuuuucking miserable and so scary. Doctor said don’t take it until 10 days after your last dose. I took it 2 hours after my last dose. Thank God, I’m feeling better this morning. 


What’s crazy is that I’m not feeling much WD’s at all this morning. Does taking naltrexone speed up your WD’s? Like you have them really intensely, but for a lot less time. Isn’t that how rapid detox works?

So I used to be an IV heroin user (about 4 years?) stopped in 2016 and took a short break, but then got back to prescription pills (everything from 30s to norcos....and I just eat or snort them). I don’t do them every day. Sometimes I will do them a week or two in a row, but not always. and I’ve smoked a little BTH here and there. I also took Kratom for a while and have done plenty of suboxen (IV 😬😬😬). But nothing for like two weeks and only sporadically before that.

For a while now, I have random dope sick symptoms. My legs will ache. I’ll throw up or get the runs (or worse). I’ll get a runny nose. Headache. Kratom or opiates will make it go away. But it’s like ...why? Why would I have acute symptoms if I haven’t used in two weeks?

The a WEIRDEST PART WHICH I REALLY hope someone can give me some answers on, is twice now I’ve gotten what was DEFINITELY dopesick AFTER using pills. Like a hangover almost. Way too soon for someone to be dopesick. Example: did about 90 mg of oxy over the course of a night and by 3 am I was puking and feeling dopesick. It’s not like when you do too much dope and you just puke or whatever, i was in bed sweating, shaking, kicking, puking. WTH? It happened another time too.

What gives?!?!? Has anyone experienced anything like this? Are my receptors just so damaged that I’m dope sick for life????? Are these hep C symptoms? (I was tested years ago in a detox place and they said my enzymes were fine but who knows).

- First did it about 7 mos ago 

-spends 35-40 at a time, lasts 4-6 hrs (he says he doesn’t even get high from it anymore)

-said he has never had a scare, he doesn’t believe the dope he gets has fent because it comes in rock form🙄( I kno different thanks to you guys and this sub)

-said he has to wait two days to take subs to avoid precip which contradicts his theory on no fent (correct me if I’m wrong)

-said it is no different than blues other than the price, the high feels the same

I’m scared if I tell him to go detox at his moms, he won’t. He’s getting calls from his employees who also use (just found that out)but... he is laying here waiting for the worst to come.

Just did some and passed oit over 10hrs + benzos +107mg methadone,"Soo had a meeting w my lawyer and my mathadone clinic counselor, was nervous bcni knew I was gonna get ""3 month trial probation"" and if I use heroin them it !eans jail which I love using.

I'm on a benzo taper down to 55mg diazepam a day, 20 mg AM, 15mg afternoon, 20mg PM.

But I said fuck it I'm nervous and gobbled down 40mg

So we talked they said the benzos were making me act weird, everyone has said that including my gfs just way way more talkative and interrupting people and talking to strangers about innaprop things like saying ""damn or ass"" which to my older gf she doesn't see respectful, it's not but I thought ""hey it's just me being me""

So anyways I didn't care my gfs got a check and I'm getting paid around $150 tmrw after work so we spent her whole $120 on H and bars, oh yeah a $10 eigth for her bc I hate weed it makes me paranoid.


Went to the dgirl! Paid $80 for my gram after using the test strip I know why people pay $100/g) she swears up and down I'm the only one she does $80/grams for, and I have to get a whole gram. For my bday she did .75/$60 but that was an exception,no $40 halves lol. 
+ 8 bars for $44 (she upped me from $5 to $5.5 bc her guy upped her, could have said $6 but she knows I'm cheap, also the 2mg kpins went from ,$4---->$4.50 oh well still a bargain for when she doesn't have any bars. She said someone just bought 20 bars for $8 a pop so ,$160 so looksmlike those 8 I might be able to get a few more but then again maybe not. These are some of the last remaining script non pressed bars and people pay 3/$20 for fake pressed ones on the street so $44/8 ain't so bad.

I also owed her $14 so paid off $10 of that

Plus my gf loves her weed she grows personally and does $10 8ths after talking her down from $15, I told her legal weed places one in particular sells $2/gram prerolls and $7/8ths, Even 8 & 9 dollar 8ths of you want smth diff but still less than ,$10. Grams of dabs with content varying from 70%-92% for ,$10 a gram, it's a 15min drive but for the dabs the local store that sells for $20 price matches me.

Anyways......


So anyways I took:

40mg diazepam in the AM
Took my 107mg methadone dose
Picked up 1.0 in really good H (she now has ""light which is gunpowder and dark which is that straight oily tar, both good the dark is where it's at though, still same price, I equate dark shots w potency so opt for the """"dark"" which I think is way stronger she prefers it too. )

Got fent test strips from Tracey and thought ""she told me a year ago someone she sells to did a fent test strip and got a positive, thought that was hype. But sure enough 1 line, positive for fentanyl. 

I casually take 1.5 bars so 3mg alprazolam waiting for her to get back we divided them 5 for me 3 for her bc she takes 1 and is out for the count, sleeping not ODing.

So I thought ""so what it must have always been positive for fent I'll do my regular .3 shot and gave my gf a .2"" 

The .2 knocked her out but she was talking and just slurring. She casually takes a bar after and while it's in her mouth I say ""remember this has fent take a half""

I did mine and usually am an intramuscular user, hence why I use a bit more. Well the stars aligned and I got a vein second try, burned a bit but no miss. 

Fuck I remember how itchy my rush was and gf said I slurred a few words then passed out she checked and said I was breathing so slow it was ""barely breathing"" scary for her. 

10h later w a half g left I might stretch that into 2, shots each vs 1 of us ODing. We have narcan but w the METHADONE OMG that would be a wd nightmare!!!!

Still just took 20mg diazepam like scripted could have skipped but didn't for some reason. 


BTW showed her in a text a pic w a positive fent result ""yeah I know I told you a year ago I know it has to have fent to be that strong! Not that much tho bc the legs are still there along w the tar effect (6 monoaceytal morphine hits you diff than straight east coast refined diamorphine) 

Short story:

Today I took:

40 mg Valium
107 mg methadone
3mg alprazolam
.3 shot of fent laced dope, IV which I usually can't find a vein and IM 
Woke up 10 hrs later 
Took 20mg diazepam as scripted not like anything else was but I thought I needed it, hell I wanted it but in a small dose. 


Getting a work check of about ,$150 dont wanna blow it on drugs, no wonder vs a. ,$80 teener her $80 gram kicks ass it's got fent in it, so please don't think bc it's tar your are immune to getting a bag that is contaminated w fent. 


On a lighter note my dad bought me some blue and white Retro 4 Jordans!!!! I love them he dropped them off while I wasn't home bc he had to get back home which is 50 miles south. Prob dropped $200 on them, they have been tried on twice fick they look brand new. Prob won't wear and keep in the box too nice I'll be afraid of getting dirty!!


Got you tied up like my Retro 4s - Kid Ink: No Strings ever since then I wanted a blue and white pair and he got me one even though they are damn near impossible to get!

Upstairs our two separate rooms were filled with boxes and mattresses from Craigslist. I  had won the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors and got the bigger room.

 Three big windows spread across  the wall facing the street, to the right was a wall with 2 sets of double closet doors that spanned the wall, to the vanity area. The vanity was a one person square, cabinets, a sink, mirror, and light bar opposite floor to ceiling shelves. The door to the toilet and an uncomfortable, cheap, bathtub and shower, faced one window on the wall. More scarred faces and unwanted surprises had alredy happened because of the rooms set up than I'm willing to admit. Adins room mirrored mine with the exception of his walk in closet and smaller windows, our beds in the corner same corners. With moving boxes for a nightstands and goodwill lamps as the only lights, our rooms reflected us individually.

With the old surf and skate pictures that I taped up on my walls and my longboards, I hung on to being the fun California bro, the old mask I worked hard to keep it in line. The rest of the room, devoid of anything but a red blanket and  a picture frame with 4 pictures stashed in it. The picture on top depicted my uncle and I at the beach in '08, walking down Pismo beach toward a distant peir. This was the part that reflected a me devoid of any hope, with a bit of love and full of memories I wished I could go back to.

The creature hiding behind the mask, pressing buttons and controls, taking care of mundane tasks, social and church obligations, making friends, being in the action, keept my secrets deep within it's veins. Any sane person would want free of this mask and the parasite within, changing you bit by bit. Instead I  embraced the mask, it took care of everything and I lived in stoned bliss. 
---------------------

The rest of the apartment had blank beige walls, a small sparse kitchen furnished mostly by my grandmother. I  was the first grandchild for her, and I took advantage of the generosity quickly whenever the apartment needed something.

The one thing we did have plenty of was sofas. My mother had been on Facebook finding every free couch avaliable for us. We picked up 3 at once one night, one for smoking weed out on the porch, two had good views of the loaned projector on the family room wall. Eventually there were two more where the dining nook should have been, for those who had partied into unconsciousness. 

The three defining characteristics of our apartment were the sofas, the shopping cart, and the giant, industrial, wooden spool that served as a coffee table. The empty spool had been in the appartment when I came home from work, apparently Adins brother had found it? But who cared? It was pretty cool and weed crumbs could always be found in the cracks.

The shopping cart was another matter though... On our first night Adin suggested we get sofa trays from the  Bed Bath and Beyond in the shopping center behind our row of apartments. He convinced me saying he'd get a grape Game at the Food Lion. We dicked around like only newly free 20 year old boys could but left with two tables and a towel for Adin. We raced carts outside as soon as the words ""first one home wins"" came out I knew I had made a mistake. Adin stole meaningless shit for fun, and started bolting home cart and all. I yelled but it was to no effect, he had his mind set, and I cut through the woods home. I had started rolling the Grape Game into a blunt when Adin burst in the loose door, shopping cart first. We fought briefly but in the end, it collected junk, and a peace blunt was smoked on the porch.
-------------------------- 

It was Monday, we should have been at work, slaving and sabotaging away. Instead we both sat on the porch wrapped in robes and blankets, passing a blue double bubbler back and forth. As the world around me became picturesque like Planet Earth, I relaxed and let it take me for a moment. Over the weekend the earth had blessed and cursed all the Triangle, the first snowstorm of the year was heavy, wet and cold. It snowed, melted, and froze everything to a sheet of ice. For Travis our employer this was a problem because work couldn't be done, for us it was heaven because we had heat, an Xbox and weed. After a half hour out in the cold, smoking every remnant of weed and resin Adin squints at me and says he's hungry. I suggest Starbucks and he suggests bagels and so our quest begins.

Starbucks never closes so we decide to go there first, the place was packed. Suits, determined to get to the office, beside moms, just trying to get some caffeine until it's an acceptable time to drink mommies special ""juice"", and teenage girls. The normal crowd for the day, with two flies in the ink. Adin and I, Adin couldn't get his eye drops in so his eyes looked like tomatoes. In addition to this he was wearing a very fashionable pair of footy pajamas that made him look like a penguin and his robe over that. I wasn't doing much better though I had on dark blue joggers that weren't mine, my favorite light blue Scary Kids Scaring Kids t-shirt. Complete with a T-Rex and robot wolves fighting on it, a wool Mister Rogers sweater and a blanket I had methodically folded into a thick scarf, made me looking homeless. We looked stoned and smelled the part too, moms quietly hushed their children about us. Some kids even manage to point before they are scolded. 'I don't care what anybody thinks' is the thought that fules me as I stand at my full 6'1"". 

A cop standing at attention in the corner  catches my eye briefly, as I surveyed the room. I keep him in my peripheral vision as we order two large, and complicated bean waters. Eventually he shrugged and went back to his phone, confidence really is the key, I suppose. As we get our coffees Adin turns around, a petrified look plastered on his face. ""Dude there's a cop right there, let's get the fuck out of here"" he says, heading quickly for the door. I simply smirk and follow Adin out, clutching our coffees for warmth, we cut across the frozen parking lots toward Brugers.

Brugers was also packed with people, no cops though. I'm a Californian through and through, where Brugers doesn't exist, so I am lost in the menu and procedure. Adin orders for both of us, as I stumble about with my wallet open. I hand my card to the cashier with shaky hands, I am not confidant in this place. But we leave with three bagels and one salmon bagel sandwich thing I had managed to order. The trek back home was a delicate dance of avoiding ice and holding hot coffee. We made it home in one peice along with our breakfasts. As we wolfed down the amazing food, I told Adin over and over how amazing my sandwich was.

After breakfast came our first hot box of the closet under the stairs. We designated this the official house hot box room as it was under the stairs, it barely fit two people, and it was in the bathroom with a fan downstairs. After our hot box session we emerged ready to take on the onslaught of online multiplayer Call Of Duty.
--------------------------

Most of Monday and Tuesday were lost to this cycle of drugs, video games, and sleep. When Wednesday came around it was obvious that we would be working on Thursday, snow was piled on the shady side of the roads but the roads themselves were 85% clear. Like the ice our vacation was coming to an end. A last hurrah was our signature move and so we threw a party that night. Lucas and Mira made the drive, to our humble escape. Lucas had used the snow as an excuse to stay with Mira for a few days, against his parents will. I had picked up Brooke yesterday, and she had an excuse to stay the night. Val was the last addition to the party having trugged through the snow for two and a half to make it to our place. Adin supplied her with dry clothes, while we debated the best way to mix Everclear. 

One part Everclear for every 2 parts lemonade, this was the concoction we all agreed on for the night. We began a game of Red, Purple, Black, a terrible game of probabilities, none of which were in your favor. Within thirty minutes I was already ""the floor is my home now"" drunk, Adin and Brooke got me upstairs with some struggle.

After what felt like a couple hours and a loud drunk sex session, I emerge soberish and unashamed back to the party. As soon as Adin saw me he exclaimed ""He Lives!"", I take a small bow as Adin hands me half a blunt. Lucas and Mira had taken my usual couch seat, so I sat on the floor. Brooke wound around me, love and warmth radiate between us. Between pulls from the blunt we passed our only controller around the room, every time we died. 'Is this what the 90's were like? Trading controllers, only one screen on, just friends hanging out'. I archive this thought to ponder later while much higher, as I return to the conversation. Adin is watching Lucas play Call of Duty, talking loadouts. Brooke, Mira and Val are talking about something they saw on Facebook or Reddit. I settle into the rythym of the night, smoking, videogames, chiming in to conversation. 'Ahhhh...' This is well worth every day I've let slip away unpaid.

Inevitably Thursday will come and I will have to return to pretending to be an adult. Until then I will remain in this moment.

I came across them while cleaning a condemned house a hoarder had previously lived in.  The pills expired in the mid 2000’s, but from my reading it seems they should still be okay for consumption.  Two of the days I took the pills I also hit one or two small dabs after swallowing them.  I can’t say I felt any euphoria whatsoever, mostly just got really heavy eyed and sat there feeling kind of content, but also wondering if that’s all there was to it.  Maybe the dabs overpowred the hydrocodone, but the day I tried it without smoking I got the same results, heavy eyes and overall very tired.  Anyway, it wasn’t a full bottle when I found it, but pretty damn close.  How easily will I get hooked on these things if keep doing them like this?  I have no other source for them and wouldn’t have any interest in seeking them out either.  I did also find some generic ambien, a muscle relaxer called Parafon Forte, and some other bottle I can’t remember while cleaning the house.  I’ve smoked for quite some years now, and tried Xanax one time two years ago but haven’t touched it since.  I’ve always wanted to try harder drugs, but now that I have them I wonder I shouldn’t just flush them before I get too deep.

I am here for my opiate/heroin addiction that has had its ups and downs in my life since 2008, disappearing after therapy or medically assisted treatment only to rear its ugly head back into my life always at different times and sometimes at the worst of times. 												
Ive been dealing with a pretty bad relapse really since Dec 2017. It started creeping in Sept 2017 and by April of 2018 all I could think of was getting high . Granted sometimes I would supplement with Kratom to not use every single day but I did use say 5 days out of the week. The year then included me overdosing, being found naked and dead by my partner (now ex) who dressed me and called 911. They administered narcan multiple times until I had to have it IV in the ambulance where I came to. I then kept using, went to rehab, was clean for 4 months, fell in love at rehab, we ended up using together. I started using needles, I got compulsive and didn’t want to stop. My family sent me here.	 
I have 5 days left here at this beautiful house that was started by an older Canadian lady who is now deceased and left the place to a group of 4 Mexican hippie kids who work in the health care field , emt tech, nurse, and a couple other people that work here. She met these kids while down here trying to start an Ibogaine clinic. They shared her love of pot smoking and the healing power of plant medicine and psychedelics. This place has treated people from celebrities to humbolt pot growers, to people from all over the US and Europe. This place is good vibes for sure. 	

I have been here for a week now. Just starting to feel better. My Ibogaine treatment happened Thursday night so it has been 5 days without any opiates. I woke up from my trance with no withdrawal symptoms despite it having been 24 hours since my last dose of morphine. However, I threw up a couple times the next morning and while throwing up I went into full on withdrawal mode, sweat from every pore of my body, shaking, chills, muscle spasms, but as soon as the puking ended I was back to feeling fine. This happened both times. I had also fasted since noon Thursday so I had nothing in my stomach but water. 								
Later in the day I felt the Ibogaine completely wear off and I felt some slight withdrawal symptoms at night like restless legs and watery eyes, enough to keep me from sleeping. I haven’t been able to sleep much since then without muscle relaxers, clonidine and benzos that I shamelessly look from the office not knowing they would give me some if I had only asked, which i did last night and the night before. I also found some Imodium the first night after Ibogaine and took a bunch of that in a desperate attempt to stop my restless jerking legs. 	
Hopefully tonight I can finally sleep with maybe just melatonin and Tylenol . I’m still having lingering withdrawal symptoms like random pains and sneezing. Someone here said that those are also lingering effects of the Ibogaine but I don’t know how much I buy that. But today I finally took a shower without being forced to and went out on errands with the care takers here. They kept trying to get me to come out of my room last few days and I was just not feeling it lol. Finally feeling like myself and with my cravings being way less than they usually are when I typically quit. So I would say today is a good day. Got some drawing supplies to keep me busy and finally listening to music again. Just wanted to share my experience since I know many of us have wondered about Ibogaine for a while.

So I walked out without buying anything and the alarms went off I just kept walking. Got in my car and left. I didn’t notice anyone coming after me or anyone telling me stop.
